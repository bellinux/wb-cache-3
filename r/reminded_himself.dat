2500|$|Once alerted by Edwin Bollier of Mebo to the MegrahiFhimah {{friendship}} and business relationship, Scottish police obtained permission to search Fhimah's office in Malta. There {{they found a}} diary he had kept, {{in which he had}} <b>reminded</b> <b>himself,</b> on December 15, 1988, in English, to [...] "take taggs [...] from Air Malta." ...|$|E
2500|$|Darwin's speculations in his {{notebooks}} deepened as {{he wondered}} how instincts and mental traits were passed on to offspring; [...] "Thought (or desires more properly) being hereditary {{it is difficult to}} imagine it anything but structure of brain hereditary, analogy points out to this. – love of the deity effect of organization, oh you materialist!", and <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> to read Barclay [...] "on organization!!" ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{preferred}} {{being an}} adviser and counselor, {{rather than simply}} a strategist in lawsuits, which {{would allow him to}} advise his clients on how to avoid problems, such as lawsuits, strikes, or other crises. Brandeis explained: [...] "I would rather have clients than be somebody's lawyer." [...] In a note found among his papers, he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> to [...] "advise client on what he should have, not what he wants." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Wilks shuffled {{his feet}} and strove to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> {{that he was a}} gentleman of {{independent}} means, and could please himself.|$|R
30|$|Ravindran {{is able to}} {{maintain}} his self-esteem {{in the midst of}} discrimination by <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> that he can do things others {{will not be able to}} do.|$|R
50|$|Not having news anymore, {{considering}} deceived by Muthaiya, Vélahi <b>reminds</b> <b>himself</b> {{the good}} {{memory of her}} lover.This one answers him, by setting up, a plan to eliminate his wife.|$|R
60|$|Because he had {{forgotten}} and because he remembered that he had <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> twice not to forget.|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> in a {{state of}} excitement, [...] "we must sit up all night, my Christopher. I must correct these Proofs for the press. Fill all the inkstands, and bring me several new pens." ...|$|E
60|$|With this comforting thought, {{he started}} on his perilous {{journey to the}} open air. As he walked delicately, not courting observation, he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of the hero of 'Pilgrim's Progress'. On all sides of him lay fearsome beasts, lying in wait to pounce upon him. At any moment Mr Gregory's hoarse roar might shatter the {{comparative}} stillness, or the sinister note of Mr Bickersdyke make itself heard.|$|E
50|$|The {{pendulum}} speeds up, slows down, {{and sometimes}} stops, but {{returns to the}} correct time every five minutes. Taylor designed the clock to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of his own mortality.|$|R
5000|$|The last {{track of}} the album, [...] "Let It Go", is a lament {{inspired}} by Nathan reading to his two-year-old son, and <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> of {{his place in the}} world.|$|R
50|$|Noble wore one of {{the highest}} numbers in college {{baseball}} (#85, as opposed to his playing #9), which he said he wore to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of becoming a Christian in 1985.|$|R
60|$|He jerked {{forward the}} flask and Rigg {{went to a}} fine old oaken bureau with his keys. But Raffles had <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> by his {{movement}} with the flask that it had become dangerously loose from its leather covering, and catching sight of a folded paper which had fallen within the fender, he took it up and shoved it under the leather {{so as to make}} the glass firm.|$|E
60|$|Charmed at {{the ease}} with which he had {{demolished}} the objections of Mr. Adolphus Swann and won that suffering gentleman over to his plans, Hardy began to cast longing glances at Equator Lodge. He <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that the labourer was worthy of his hire, and it seemed moreover an extremely desirable thing that Captain Nugent should know that he was labouring in his vineyard with the full expectation of a bounteous harvest. He resolved to call.|$|E
60|$|The {{protective}} instinct {{in the man}} {{was suddenly}} strong. Naturally unaffectionate, he was conscious of an almost overmastering desire to take her hands in his, even to lift her up and kiss away the tears which shone in her deep, childlike eyes. He <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> {{that she was a}} stranger, that her appearance of youth was a delusion, that she could only construe such an action as a liberty, an impertinence, offered under circumstances for which there could be no possible excuse.|$|E
60|$|Longueville stared; {{there was}} an unexpectedness in the speech and an incongruity in Mrs. Vivian's {{beginning}} to flatter him. He needed to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> that {{if she was a}} Bostonian, she was a Bostonian perverted.|$|R
2500|$|Miao Ruolan (...) is Miao Renfeng's daughter. She is {{forbidden}} to learn martial arts by her father, who does so to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of {{the guilt of}} accidentally killing Hu Yidao. She {{falls in love with}} Hu Fei.|$|R
6000|$|... “I {{should be}} ever so glad if you’d try,” Waterville had earnestly said, {{constantly}} <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> that Americans in Europe were after all, in a degree, {{to a man}} in his position, as the sheep to the shepherd.|$|R
60|$|It was {{necessary}} now that Sir Lionel should summon up his best courage. He <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> {{that after all}} his brother was but a feeble old man--impotent in all but money; and as it seemed now clear that no further pecuniary aid was to be expected, why need he fear him on this account? Had it been {{possible for him to}} get away without further talk, he would have done so; but this was not possible, so he determined to put a good face on it.|$|E
60|$|She smiled again, turned, {{and walked}} away, leaving George to reckon {{up all the}} social solecisms he had {{contrived}} to commit {{in the space of}} a single moment. He had remained seated, he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself,</b> throughout the interview; one. He had not raised his hat, that fascinating Homburg simply made to be raised with a debonair swish under such conditions; two. Call it three, because he ought to have raised it twice. He had gaped like a fool; four. And, five, he had not uttered a single word of acknowledgement in reply to her thanks.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't mind letters now if I was you. If {{you don't}} mind, we'll {{go and look}} up the parsons. There are {{four or five of}} 'em, and they like to be seen;--not in the way of canvassing. They're all right, of course. And there's two of 'em won't leave a stone unturned in the outside hamlets. But they like to be seen, and their wives like it." [...] Whereupon Mr. Trigger ordered breakfast,--and eat it. Sir Thomas <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that a {{fortnight}} was after all but a short duration of time. He might live through a fortnight,--probably,--and then when Mr. Griffenbottom came it would be shared between two.|$|E
5000|$|... "Still" [...] is a {{moderate}} up-tempo country song, backed primarily by electric guitar. The song's male narrator describes remembering his favorite {{place to be}} in his past, and <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> that he can [...] "just be still" [...] in order to reach it.|$|R
50|$|He {{often said}} that he never missed a chance to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of his {{favourite}} goal in the national team uniform, against England in Belgrade, in 1954. Yugoslavia won 1-0 as Rajko Mitić scored the decisive goal in the dying minutes of the match.|$|R
50|$|To Sei-hoi (Sunny Chan) is the adopted {{son of an}} executioner. After his foster father's death, {{he carries}} his golden executioner blade with him {{wherever}} he goes to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of his identity. He befriends Shui Yu-chan, a doctor, and the two become sworn brothers.|$|R
60|$|The clock struck four. Dick fidgeted about, yawned privately; {{counted the}} knots in the table, yawned publicly; counted the flies on the ceiling, yawned horribly; {{went into the}} kitchen and scullery, and so {{thoroughly}} studied the principle upon which the pump was constructed that he could have delivered a lecture on the subject. Stepping back to Fancy, and finding still that she had not done, he went into her garden and looked at her cabbages and potatoes, and <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that they seemed to him to wear a decidedly feminine aspect; then pulled up several weeds, and came in again. The clock struck five, and still the snipping and sewing went on.|$|E
6000|$|Captain Batsby {{had been}} called a fool also at Ostend, and there, amidst the {{distressing}} circumstances of his position, had been constrained to bear the opprobious name, little customary {{as it is for}} one gentleman to allow himself to be called a fool by another; but now he had collected his thoughts, had <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of his position in the world, and had told himself that it did not become him to be too humble before this City man of business. It might have been all very well at Ostend; but {{he was not going to}} be called a fool in London without resenting it. [...] "Sir Thomas," [...] said he, [...] "fool and folly are terms which I cannot allow you to use to me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{should be}} said on his behalf that he {{attributed}} to himself no preponderance of excellence, either on the score of his money or his rank. He was able so to honour the girl as {{to think of her}} that such things would go for nothing with her. It was not that he had put his coronet at her feet, but his heart. It was of that he thought when he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> of all that he had done for her, and told himself angrily that she should not have tormented him. He was as arrogant and impatient of disappointment as any young lord of them all,--but it was not, however, because he was a lord that he thought that Marion's heart was due to him.|$|E
50|$|Snoopy then wakes Charlie Brown and recounts his {{nightmare}} in pantomime, {{to which}} Charlie Brown allows Snoopy {{to spend the}} night inside with him, but not before Snoopy helps himself to a large ice cream sundae, <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> his Arctic experience was indeed just a nightmare.|$|R
6000|$|... [Illustration: The captain {{fell back}} silent, and Mr. Tasker, pausing in a respectful attitude, watched him wistfully. The captain’s brows were bent in thought, and Mr. Tasker, <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> that crews had trembled at his nod {{and that all}} were silent when he spoke, felt a flutter of hope.] ...|$|R
50|$|St. Jerome (342 - 420), {{settled in}} Bethlehem in 386, {{where he lived}} in a cave next to that in which Christ had been born, {{translating}} the Scriptures from Hebrew and Greek into Latin. He enjoyed controversies with heretics, kept a pet lion (to discourage interruptions?) and a skull to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of his mortality.|$|R
60|$|The {{rational}} {{part of him}} (whether {{the wiser}} or not) regained its supremacy. He remembered that the proprietor {{had told him that}} he should lock the door, and would come later to release him. He told himself that twenty things he had not thought of might explain the eccentric sounds outside; he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that there was just enough light left to finish his own proper work. Bringing his paper to the window so as to catch the last stormy evening light, he resolutely plunged once more into the almost completed record. He had written for about twenty minutes, bending closer and closer to his paper in the lessening light; then suddenly he sat upright. He had heard the strange feet once more.|$|E
60|$|His visitor {{had lost}} {{none of his}} embarrassment. The Marquis, in his old-fashioned dinner clothes, his black stock, the fob which hung from his waistcoat, his finely chiselled features, and that mysterious air of being entirely {{in touch with his}} surroundings, had him at a {{disadvantage}} from the first. Borden was wearing the somewhat shabby blue serge suit in which he had travelled all day, and which he had neglected to brush. He had been too much in earnest about his mission to do more than make the most hasty toilet at the hotel. The high-backed chair, which suited the Marquis so well, was an unfamiliar article of furniture to him, and he sat upon it stiffly and without ease. Nevertheless, he <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that he was there--he must say what he had come to say.|$|E
60|$|The {{child could}} not think {{what she was talking}} about, but he quite {{understood}} the soup, which tasted most delicious. His mother had often given him nice things, but nothing had ever seemed so good as this. The smell of the herbs and spices rose from the bowl, and the soup tasted both sweet and sharp at the same time, and was very strong. As he was finishing it the guinea pigs lit some Arabian incense, which gradually filled the room with clouds of blue vapour. They grew thicker and thicker and the scent nearly overpowered the boy. He <b>reminded</b> <b>himself</b> that he must get back to his mother, but whenever he tried to rouse himself to go he sank back again drowsily, and at last he fell sound asleep {{in the corner of the}} sofa.|$|E
5000|$|The text of {{the poem}} {{describes}} the thoughts of a lone rider (the speaker), pausing at night in his travel to watch snow falling in the woods. It ends with him <b>reminding</b> <b>himself</b> that, despite the loveliness of the view, [...] "I have promises to keep, / And miles to go before I sleep." ...|$|R
50|$|Frobisher {{was once}} married to Francine, another Whifferdill, who left him {{because she was}} a better detective than he was. Apparently, he was very fond of her in penguin form, and so adopted it to <b>remind</b> <b>himself</b> of her. It is not a static form, however, as Frobisher has been seen emulating {{different}} types of penguins.|$|R
50|$|In Journey Into Mystery, Volstagg {{protects the}} de-aged Loki despite his misgivings about his former foe. He often regrets his actions but <b>reminds</b> <b>himself</b> {{he took an}} oath. His family is {{reestablished}} as existing during Fear Itself. Volstagg takes up liaison duties between Broxton, Oklahoma and his reformed homeland, now called Asgardia and ruled by the All-Mother.|$|R
