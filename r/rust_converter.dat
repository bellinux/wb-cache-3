5000|$|Commercial <b>rust</b> <b>converters</b> are {{water-based}} {{and contain}} two primary active ingredients: Tannic acid [...] and an organic polymer. Tannic acid chemically converts the reddish iron oxides into bluish-black ferric tannate, {{a more stable}} material. The second active ingredient is an organic solvent such as 2-Butoxyethanol (ethylene glycol monobutyl ether, trade name butyl cellosolve) {{that acts as a}} wetting agent and provides a protective primer layer in conjunction with an organic polymer emulsion. Some <b>rust</b> <b>converters</b> may contain additional acids to speed up the chemical reaction by lowering the pH of the solution. A common example is phosphoric acid, which additionally converts some iron oxide into an inert layer of ferric phosphate.|$|R

40|$|<b>Rust</b> <b>converters</b> are {{chemical}} formulations {{that can}} be applied to corroded surfaces causing the passivation and elimination of possible further attack after the application of a coating. Tannins extracted from mangrove, chestnut, quebracho and mimosa as <b>rust</b> <b>converters</b> were evaluated. Two different types of pre-rusted sample preparations were adopted. The pre-rusted samples were immersed in 5 g/l of the various tannin solutions and the phase transformations were analyzed via Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The rust components were mainly lepidocrocite (γ-FeOOH) and magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) and were found to be dependent on sample preparations. Transformation of rust components to ferric-tannates, particularly lepidocrocite, in the presence of various tannins could be observed. The relation between the partial transformation of pre-rusted samples and sample preparation is correlated...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rust</b> <b>converters</b> are {{chemical}} solutions or primers {{that can}} be applied directly to an iron or iron alloy surface to convert iron oxides (rust) into a protective chemical barrier. These compounds interact with iron oxides, especially iron(III) oxide, converting them into an adherent black layer that is more resistant to moisture and protects the surface from further corrosion. They are sometimes referred to as [...] "rust remover" [...] or [...] "rust killer".|$|R
40|$|The {{anticorrosion}} {{properties of}} polymer emulsion modified cement-based coating with healing effect on carbon steel were investigated. The change of linear polarization resistance (Rp) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{have been used}} to measure the inhibitive and curative effect of electrodes painted with the coating in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. The results indicated the high alkalinity of filler (cement) in coating can obviously improve the anticorrosion performance of coated steel electrodes. And the inhibitive ability of cement-based coating with fluoride acrylic emulsion is superior to that of the coating with epoxy emulsion. Moreover, by adding antirust pigments and <b>rust</b> <b>converters</b> in the fluoride acrylic emulsion modified cement-based coating, the inhibitive property was improved and the curative effect can be observed...|$|R

40|$|Lignin is {{the second}} most natural organic polymer on the earth and it can be {{acquired}} from the wastes of wood pulping processing in the form of black liquor. The inhibition efficiencies of Kraft lignin (KL) and Soda lignin (SL) on the corrosion of mild steel in 3. 5 % (w/v) sodium chloride at two levels of pH have been evaluated by weight loss method, electrochemical techniques and surface analysis using 50 - 800 ppm (w/v) inhibitor concentration at 25 °C. Both KL and SL can perform as good inhibitors for the above-mentioned system. The KL gave maximum inhibition efficiencies of 95 and 92 % for pH 6 and pH 8, respectively at high concentrations of inhibitor, whereas SL gave 97 and 95 % inhibition efficiencies for pH 6 and pH 8, respectively at 800 ppm of inhibitor concentration. Polarization studies confirmed that KL and SL are mixed type inhibitors. Both KL and SL obey Langmuir’s adsorption isotherm at two levels of pH and 25 °C. FT-IR and surface analyses confirmed that the surface of mild steel was affected by the adsorption of lignin onto the surface to form ferric-lignin compounds. The rust components especially lepidocrocite were reduced; hence, lignin {{can be used as a}} <b>rust</b> <b>converter...</b>|$|E
40|$|Proper surface {{preparation}} {{has been the}} key to obtain good performance by a surface coating. The major obstacle in preparing a corroded or rusted surface is the complete removal of the contaminants and the corrosion products. Sandblasting has been traditionally used to remove the corrosion products before painting. However, sandblasting can be expensive, may be prohibited by local health regulations and is not applicable in every situation. To get around these obstacles, Industry developed rust converters/rust transformers and rust compatible primers (high solids epoxies). The potential use of these products for military equipment led personnel of the Belvoir Research, Development and Engineering Center (BRDEC) to evaluate the commercially available rust transformers and rust compatible primers. Prior laboratory experience with commercially available rust converters, as well as field studies in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, revealed poor performance, several inherent limitations, and lack of reliability. It was obvious from our studies that the performance of rust converting products was more dependent on the amount and type of rust present, {{as well as the}} degree of permeability of the coating, than on the product's ability to form an organometallic complex with the rust. Based on these results, it was decided that the Military should develop their own <b>rust</b> <b>converter</b> formulation and specification. The compound described in the specification is for use on a rusted surface before the application of an organic coating (bituminous compounds, primer or topcoat). These coatings should end the need for sandblasting or the removing of the adherent corrosion products. They also will prepare the surface for the application of the organic coating. Several commercially available rust compatible primers (RCP) were also tested using corroded surfaces. All of the evaluated RCP failed our laboratory tests for primers...|$|E
