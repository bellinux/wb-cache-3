In this context this article presents a call control component able to handle calls between a telephone and a PC, accordingly to actions decided by the application layer that sets up and <b>redirects</b> <b>calls</b> between terminals over heterogeneous networks like Internet and PSTN.

The CORBA specification further addresses data typing, exceptions, network protocols, communication timeouts, etc. For example: Normally the server side has the Portable Object Adapter (POA) that <b>redirects</b> <b>calls</b> {{either to the}} local servants or (to balance the load) to the other servers. The CORBA specification (and thus this figure) leaves various aspects of distributed system to the application to define including object lifetimes (although reference counting semantics are available to applications), redundancy/fail-over, memory management, dynamic load balancing, and application-oriented models such as the separation between display/data/control semantics (e.g. see Model-view-controller), etc.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Isolating {{test cases}} from {{environment}} dependencies is often desirable, as it increases test reliability and reduces test execution time. However, code that calls non-virtual methods or consumes sealed classes is often impossible to test in isolation. Moles {{is a new}} lightweight framework which addresses this problem. For any. NET method, Moles allows test-code to provide alternative implementations, given as. NET delegates, for which C # provides very concise syntax while capturing local variables in a closure object. Using code instrumentation, the Moles framework will <b>redirect</b> <b>calls</b> to provided delegates instead of the original methods. The Moles framework is designed to work together with the dynamic symbolic execution tool Pex to enable automated test generation. In a case study, testing code programmed against the Microsoft SharePoint Foundation API, we achieved full code coverage while running tests in isolation without an actual SharePoint server. The Moles framework integrates with. NET and Visual Studio. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{issues of}} process monitoring on Windows NT operating systems family and describes our implementation of an infrastructure for process monitoring. The system comprises of a core component and user defined external modules. The kernel component hooks system functions and <b>redirects</b> <b>calls</b> {{to the external}} modules running in the user space. The core component dispatches the calls to user supplied external modules that {{take care of the}} call processing. The core component defines simple API for the external modules that does not require deep knowledge of kernel programming. Moreover, this architecture simplifies versioning of the external modules. It makes them independent of a particular kernel build as long as the Windows kernel API they are monitoring is preserved. The thesis also compares our work with similar existing software and outlines future directions of development. Source codes and an executable compilation of the software are available on the attached CD. The software uses a part of GNU C Library...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Security is {{becoming}} one of the major concerns for web applications and other Internet based services, which are becoming pervasive in all kinds of business models and organizations. Web applications must therefore include, in addition to the expected value offered to their users, reliable mechanisms to ensure their security. In this paper, we focus on the specific problem of preventing cross-site scripting attacks against web applications. We present a study of this kind of attacks, and survey current approaches for their prevention. The advantages and limitations of each proposal are discussed, and an alternative solution is introduced. Our proposition is based on the use of X. 509 certificates, and XACML for the expression of authorization policies. By using our solution, developers and/or administrators of a given web application can specifically express its security requirements from the server side, and require the proper enforcement of such requirements on a compliant client. This strategy is seamlessly integrated in generic web applications by relaying in the SSL and secure <b>redirect</b> <b>calls...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract The indirection {{of object}} accesses {{is a common}} theme for target domains as diverse as {{transparent}} distribution, persistence, and program instrumentation. Virtualizing accesses to fields and methods (by <b>redirecting</b> <b>calls</b> through accessor and indirection methods) allows interposition of arbitrary code, extending the functionality of an application beyond that intended by the original developer. We present class modifications performed by our RuggedJ transparent distribution platform for standard Java virtual machines. RuggedJ abstracts over the location of objects by implementing a single object model for local and remote objects. However the implementation of this model {{is complicated by the}} presence of native and system code; classes loaded by Java’s bootstrap class loader can be rewritten only in a limited manner, and so cannot be modified to conform to RuggedJ’s complex object model. We observe that system code comprises the majority of a given Java application: an average of 78 % in the applications we study. We consider the constraints imposed upon pervasive class transformation within Java, and present a framework for systematically rewriting arbitrary applications. Our system accommodates all system classes, allowing both user and system classes alike to be referenced using a single object model...|$|R

Skype {{is the number one}} soft phone on the market but it doesn't satisfy the needs of companies (e. g. transfer <b>calls,</b> <b>redirects</b> <b>calls</b> and so forth) and leaves therefore a gap. The purpose of this master thesis is to provide Objektor AB (thesis initiator) with tips on how to design a usable soft phone that they know is based on relevant human computer interaction research. The method used in the thesis has been iterative development. Interviews with end users have been conducted where they have evaluated the usability in three lo-fi (papper mock ups) and one hi-fi (a clickable version designed in Adobe Flash) prototype of a soft phone. During the interviews the users executed 14 different work tasks in the prototypes and graded their usability on a 1 to 10 scale. During the second iteration the users also performed the 14 tasks in Skype {{in order to be able}} to compare the usability between Skype and the hi-fi prototype. The result shows that Skype isn't optimally designed to meet the needs of companies. From the final prototype Objektor can gather tips on design that is founded on principles from Jakob Nielsen and other names in the field of human computer interaction. The tips will help Objektor to design their own soft phone and thereby fill the gap on the market left by Skype...|$|R

50|$|Call forwarding, or call diversion, is a {{telephony}} {{feature of}} some telephone switching systems which <b>redirects</b> a telephone <b>call</b> to another destination, which may be, for example, a mobile telephone, voicemail box or another telephone number where the desired called party is available. Call forwarding {{was invented by}} Ernest J. Bonanno. In North America, the forwarded line usually rings once to remind the customer using call forwarding that the <b>call</b> is being <b>redirected.</b> More consistently, the forwarded line indicates its condition by stutter dial tone. Call forwarding typically can <b>redirect</b> incoming <b>calls</b> to any other domestic telephone number, but {{the owner of the}} forwarded line must pay any toll charges for forwarded calls. Call forwarding is often enabled by dialing *72 followed by the telephone number to which calls should be forwarded. Once someone answers, call forwarding is in effect. If no one answers or the line is busy, the dialing sequence must be repeated to effect call forwarding. Call forwarding is disabled by dialing *73. This feature requires a subscription from the telephone company. Also available in some areas is Remote Access to call forwarding, which permit the control over call forwarding from telephones other than the subscriber's telephone. VOIP and cable telephone systems also often allow call forwarding to be set up and directed via their web portals.|$|R

50|$|OpenCL {{consists}} {{of a set of}} headers and a shared object that is loaded at runtime. An installable client driver (ICD) must be installed on the platform for every class of vendor for which the runtime would need to support. That is, for example, in order to support Nvidia devices on a Linux platform, the Nvidia ICD would need to be installed such that the OpenCL runtime (the ICD loader) would be able to locate the ICD for the vendor and <b>redirect</b> the <b>calls</b> appropriately. The standard OpenCL header is used by the consumer application; calls to each function are then proxied by the OpenCL runtime to the appropriate driver using the ICD. Each vendor must implement each OpenCL call in their driver.|$|R

50|$|One of {{the more}} subtle {{features}} of the SYM-1 {{was the use of}} a look up table in the low memory of the 6502. This provided a vectoring function in its operating system to <b>redirect</b> subroutine <b>calls</b> to various input and output drivers, including interrupt servicing. Users were able to develop their own interface routines, and substitute new vectors for the original vectors in the startup UV-EPROM. This seamlessly maintained the normal operation of the board's monitor and languages such as Synertek Systems BASIC. One of the later home/education computers that used this concept extensively was the BBC Micro produced by Acorn Computers in the UK. Some of the other computer designers of this era failed to grasp the significance of this elegant use of vectors to the software mapping of new developments in hardware.|$|R
