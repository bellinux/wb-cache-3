40|$|The {{distribution}} of inundation height {{along the coast}} near the tsunami source shows two peaks. This feature has close relation to the deformation of the sea bottom in the source area. From a <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram,</b> the initial crest-height at each station along the Japanese coast seems to follow Green's law. The {{distribution of}} tsunami energy {{seems to have been}} controlled by the submarine topography. The coast near the tsunami source seems to have received strong reflected waves from north Korea. As to other feature of propagation, long-waves propagated along the slope of the continental shelf seem to have existed. From several tide-gauge records, it was concluded that tsunami waves have uniformly decayed. Decay coefficient is approximately 0. 043 per hour. 1964 年 6 月 16 日 13 時 02 分,新潟県粟島附近で発生した地震(気象庁発表によれば,震央は 38. 4 ゜N, 139. 2 °E,深さ 40 km,マグニチュード約 7. 7) に伴なつた津波は,浪源附近の沿岸で津波の高さ(M. S.

40|$|A small tsunami was {{generated}} by the Urakawa-oki earthquake (M= 7. 1) near Cape Erimo, southern Hokkaido, on March 21, 1982. At Urakawa, the initial disturbance of the present tsunami began with an upward motion simultaneous with the earthquake occurrence. The first wave period was 16 min and the third wave was the highest with a semi-amplitude of 80 cm. According to the author's method based on the attenuation of wave-amplitude with distance, the tsunami magnitude (Imamura-Iida scale) {{are estimated to be}} m = 0.

The source area of the present tsunami which inferred from an inverse <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram</b> is located along the coast from Urakawa to Shizunai. The length of the tsunami source is 40 km and the width 20 km. The tsunami source area agrees with the aftershock area.

40|$|A small tsunami {{was excited}} by the 2007 Chuetsu-oki Earthquake (M= 6. 8), {{generated}} under Japan Sea on July 16, 2007. It was detected by tide gages installed at the coast of Honshu, Japan. We analyzed the initial and the maximum waves after correcting of tidal level and response of the tide gages.

The estimated source is approximated by an ellipse of 31 km in long axis and 19 km in short axis, and determined to be located nearest to the coast. The long period of 30 - 36 minutes is attributed to wave radiated in a direction of the long axis and short one of 10 - 18 minutes is attributed to wave radiated in a direction of the short axis.

The source area extends 170 km in the NNW-SSE direction, which is smaller than that obtained by Miyabe (1941). However, the dimension estimated by the present analysis is still large for the earthquake magnitude of M= 7. 0. From a comparison of the geographic distribution of the earthquake intensity with those of the other tsunamigenic earthquakes that occurred in the Japan Sea, the magnitude of this earthquake is investigated.

40|$|The tsunami, {{which was}} {{generated}} off the northwest of Oga Peninsula in Akita Prefecture, at 16 h 58 m 7. 7 s(JST), May 7, 1964, {{was observed at}} many tide-gauge stations {{along the coast of}} the Japan Sea. The heights of tsunami were small. The epicenter of the earthquake was at 40 ° 20 'N, 139 ° 00 'E, with a depth of Okm and magnitude 6. 9. The generating area of tsunami, which was extended 50 ～ 70 km was estimated by means of an inverse <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram</b> from eight tide-gauge stations. At all the stations inspected, the initial motion of the tsunami was found to be directed upwards, showing that the crustal deformation which caused the tsunami was probably an upheaval in the source area.

It is remarkable that the features of tsunami sources for NE Japan are different from those of SW Japan. In NE Japan, the sources of small tsunamis are mostly located in the sea shallower than the depth of 2000 m and sources of large tsunamis lie on the steep continental slope near the trench. On the other hand, in SW Japan, the sources of large tsunamis lie near the coast. The major axes of source areas are parallel to the island arc. Also the gradient of gravity anomaly along the minor axis of several tsunami sources is nearly constant. The dimension of source area of tsunami generated by a deep earthquake is considerably smaller than that for a shallow earthquake. |日本近海で起きた個々の大津波については,多くの研究者によつて調査,研究があつて,波源域の推定が行われてきた. 著者はさらに 2, 3 の津波を追加して,総合した波源を海図上に示した. しかしこの分布図には,微小津波による波源の記載は十分ではなかつた...|$|E

The estimated source areas of tsunamis which were generated in the adjacent sea to Japan, are drawn on a bathymetric chart. The mean slope of the sea bottom in the vicinity of each source was of the order of 1 / 100 ～ 1 / 10. Tsunami energy seems to be affected by the slope of the sea bottom as well as the water depth at the source. The amount of the sea bottom deformation was estimated from the distribution of the inundation height of a tsunami along the coast. The average vertical displacement in the tsunami source is calculated by using the tsunami energy and the source area. The values thus obtained were of the order of several meters for large earthquakes. 1933 年の三陸津波について,宮部(1934) は各地の検潮記錠をもとに,津波の逆伝播図をえがき,波源域を推定した. この結果,波源はかなり広い領域をもつたことが明らかにされた. 以来,多くの人達によつて,同様な方法で,二十数個の津波の改源域が推定されてきている. 今回, 1923 年の関東地震および 1953 年の房総沖地震に伴なつた津波の波源域を逆伝播図によつて推定したところ,その長径はそれぞれ約 170 kmおよび 160 kmである. また関東地震の場合,その波源域は三浦半島および房総半島の隆起地帯を大きく包含し,房総沖地震の波源域は,その余震域とかなりよく一致している...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Wave {{measurements}} at Margarita Reef in south-western Puerto Rico {{show that}} wave height decreases as waves travel across the forereef {{and into the}} backreef. Wave spectra reveal the presence of two wave trains impinging on the reef during the study: trade-wind waves and locally generated seas. Significant wave height calcu-lated from the spectra show an average reduction of 19. 5 % from 20 - to 10 -m isobaths and 26 % from 20 - to 5 -m isobaths. The significant wave height decreases an average of 82 % for waves traveling across the reefcrest and into the backreef. Wave-energy reduction is 35 % from 20 - to 10 -m isobaths and 45 % from 20 - to 5 -m isobaths. Energy loss across the reef crest is 97 % which translates into the formation of strong across-the-reef currents capable of moving coarse sediment. <b>Refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> of waves impinging on the reef from the SE provide a display of wave energy distribution around the reef. The transmission coefficients calculated for trade-wind waves and locally generated seas have means of 18 % and 39 %, respectively.

Results of wave-energy changes from this study were applied to waves representative of hurricane conditions at the reef.

Since the invading waves are treated as periodic ones in this work, a straightforward application of the theory to the evaluation of the effective mesh length for the leading part of tsunamis might be a little dubious (for the later phase, the present results are applicable). But when a dimension of the irregular part of the bottom (a simple hump) is small as compared with a wave-length of the incident waves, an interference effect produced by a coupling of the progressive and retrogressive waves is likely to be also small, so that the application {{of the results of the}} periodic waves might be still possible to the leading part of tsunamis dismissing the tip of the leading waves in which no interference effect taking place in the case of periodic waves is expected. In the present study, two typical tsunamis, i. e. the Chile Tsunami and Niigata Tsunami, have been employed to determine the actual negligible dimensions of the bottom irregularities. Furthermore, in the last section, some mention is made of the waves scattered by the submarine obstacle. 本報告において,凸または凹型の海底のまわりの長波が論じられ,電子計算機による津波屈折図作製の際の有効網目の長さ(effective mesh length) の決定がおこなわれている. とくに,海底凹凸にもとづく散乱波の状態について,二三論及されている...|$|E

Tsunami height observed at the coast of eastern Hakkaido was the largest among tsunamis generated recently {{in the vicinity of the}} South Kuril Islands. At Hanasaki, the maximum height of 1. 5 m was recorded. Waveheights in northeastern and southwestern Japan are in the ranges of 40 ～ 60 cm and 20 ～ 30 cm, respectively. The initial motion of the tsunami was in an upward direction at most stations, but at Hanasaki, the initial disturbance began with a conspicuous downward motion, suggesting the subsidence of the sea bottom in a part of the tsunami source. The source area estimated by means of an inverse <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram</b> lies on the continental slope, extending about 170 km parallel to the Kuril Arc. Judging from the attenuation of the initial wave height with distance, the total wave energy seems to be equal to that of the 1958 Iturup tsunami.

The double amplitude of the sea disturbance reached 1 m on the SE Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts. The epicenter of the earthquake was at 44. 0 °N, 150. 0 °E, depth 40 km and magnitude 7. 9. The tsunami energy distribution along the Pacific coast of Japanwas calculated by drawing a <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram,</b> and was compared with the records of tide-gauges and tsunami recorders. It seems that the heights of the initial wave are well explained by thiscalculated energy distribution. The time interval between {{the arrival of the}} initial wave and the maximum amplitude wave is proportional to the origin distancemeasured along the coast. This fact suggests that the tsunami waves are mostly edge waves which were propagated along continental shelves. Dispersion curves obtained from the records of the 1958 and 1963 Iturup tsunamis coincide pretty well with the calculation for the case of a continental shelf with a width of 25 km and mean depth 200 m, bordering an ocean 2000 m deep. Records of the 1958 and 1963 Iturup tsunamis are very similar in shape, especially in the earlier part of the record, suggesting a similarity of the source mechanisms, origin positions and the paths. The appreciable phase change which was observed 8. 5 hours after the earthquake might be explained as the reflected waves from the reef between East Caroline and Marshall Islands. 1963 年 10 月 13 日 14 時 18 分(JST) エトロフ冲に発生した地震に伴つた津波は,日本太平洋沿岸全域に伝搬し,北海道南東部および三陸海岸で全振幅約 1 m,オホーツク海に面した北海道でも観測された. 各地の津波概要をTable 1 に示す. 気象庁の発表によると,この地震震央は 44. 0 °N, 150. 0 °E,深さ 40 km,マグニチュード 7. 9 である. 気象庁,海上保安庁水路部および国土地理院から提供された検潮記録をはじめ,Fig 1, 2 に示す筆者らが観測した宮城江ノ島,伊豆大島,金谷および青島の津波計記録をもとに,今回の津波の主として伝搬を吟味し,日本太平洋沿岸地域に到達した津波エネルギーの配分,Edge waveの存在などについて検討した...|$|E
40|$|Based on tide-gauge {{records of}} the USCGS and Japanese data, the {{magnitude}} and source area of the Aleutian-Alaska tsunamis during the past 42 years are investigated. According to the author's method based on the attenuation of wave-height with distance, the tsunami magnitude (Imamura-Iida scale) of the 1946 Aleutian and 1964 Alaska tsunamis {{are estimated to be}} m= 3 and 4 respectively. The magnitudes of the 1957 and 1965 Aleutian tsunamis are m= 3. According to the empirical formula, the tsunami magnitude is well correlated with seismic moment, but the seismic moment for the 1946 earthquake is considerably small. Its seismic moment may be 1. 5 × 1029 dyne-cm judging from the tsunami magnitude. The source area of the 1946 Aleutian tsunami which inferred from an inverse <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram</b> is especially different from the aftershock area. The source area lies on the steep continental slope extending about 400 km between the Unalaska and Unimak Islands. The source area of the 1957 Aleutian tsunami is the largest The length of tsunami source is 900 km which agrees with the aftershockarea. The western part of the source area overlaps about 200 km of the source area of the 1965 tsunami. In the geographic distribution of the tsunami source in the Aleutian-Alaska region, a remarkable gap of the tsunami source is found between the Unimak and Shumagin Islands. Tnis significant segment of 300 - 400 km may be considered a region of relatively high tsunami risk having the magnitude m= 2 - 3. 最近 50 年の間に,アリューシャン・アラスカ海域におこった 5 個の巨大地震に伴った津波について,米国のCGS記録に日本の観測データも加え,津波の規模と波源域を調べ,この海域の津波特性を検討した. まず,各津波の規模(m:今村・飯田スケール) を,震央から島弧にそった沿岸の波高データをもとに,筆者の方法で判定すれば,ハワイに大被害を与えた 1946 年津波はm= 3 と格付けされる. この地震のマグニチュードはM= 7. 4 とみなされているが,津波データによれば地震モーメントM 0 は 1. 5 × 1029 ダイン・cmと見積もれる. 一方これとは対照的に,地震規模が上回った 1938 年のアラスカ半島沖地震(M= 8. 3) の津波は,m= 2 と推定される. そのほか 1964 年アラスカ津波はm= 4, 1957 年・ 1965 年のアリューシャン津波はm= 3 と見積もれ,それぞれ地震モーメントに見合った津波であった. 各地で観測された津波の伝播時間をもとに,逆伝播図から波源域を推定すると, 1964 年アラスカ津波の波源域の長さは 700 kmで,余震域と大体合致する. しかし, 1946 年津波の波源域は余震域と著しく異なり,ウナラスカ島からウニマク島に至る長さ 400 kmと推定される. 1957 年津波の波源域は,余震域とほぼ合致して 900 kmにもなり,そのほかの津波も日本近海の津波と比べて,波源域は数倍も長い. 1964 年アラスカ津波では 40 分の周期が卓越したのに対し, 1946 年・ 1957 年・ 1965 年津波の周期は 10 ～ 20 分と短かく,波源域が海溝寄りにあったことを暗示している. 解析の結果,この 50 年の間に,各波源域はアッツ島沖からアラスカに至る海域に,島弧にそって並んで分布しているが,アラスカ半島ぞいのウニマク島からシュマーギン島に至る 400 kmの間に津波の空白域が見出せる. これは,近い将来,この区間にm= 2 ～ 3 クラスの津波発生の可能性が大きいことを考えさせる...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Improving our {{knowledge}} about coastlines worldwide can definitely contribute to understanding how sand coastlines with offshore bar systems operate. The study undertaken on the coastal sedimentary unit on the Bay of Mahdia where moderately active tectonic activity prevails fits into that general approach. This preliminary work presents the morphology and sedimentology of a 15 km long coastline with a sandy beach and an irregular dune ridge bordering the offshore between cape Africa and cape Dimas along the Bay of Mahdia. Morphology displays a sandy sedimentary prism composed of 3 compartments spreading from south to north. At both ends, the prism is poor in sediments along the cape promontory. In the central part, {{it is more}} regular for about 7 to 8 km, forming a 1. 4 % slope leading, at - 10 to - 12 m, to a slightly sloping plateau with relief lines highlighting the general contour of the bay. This sedimentary slope is abruptly limited to the north by a relief alignment, located in {{the extension of the}} Moknine fault. In the central part, the prism is labeled by the existence of two offshore bars of which the innermost shows instability under the hydrodynamic regime forcing. A bathymetric sounding carried out in August 2006 registered a segmentation of the inner bar, not seen on two sets of previous comparable aerial photos. This segmentation seems to be influenced by the incidence of storms, common during the summer season. A simulated wave <b>refraction</b> <b>diagram</b> of the N to E quadrant swells shows the good relationship of the wave orthogonal deviation with the distribution of the directions of the bar sections observed. The disruption and reorganization of inner bar sections under the influence of average energy storms bear witness to the symptomatic instability of a volume of sand to be displaced that can only be modest in size. Textural analysis and the nature of sediments confirm this diagnosis. The response of sediments to the selection processes shows that grain size assemblage depends on a mixture of sedimentary types in limited numbers, characteristic of the {{reduction in the number of}} sedimentary sources. The most important type uses the material from the beach and dune as a reservoir, which is in turn under the influence of reduction processes having required erosion abatement measures. Coarser populations, mainly bioclastic, become incorporated into the fine fraction of the sand whose distribution they modify. The change is however discreet, influencing primarily the asymmetry and leading to bimodality only in rare instances. In the case of Mahdia, the sedimentary sources are therefore exclusively local, rare and in small quantities...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{refraction}} {{of the tsunami}} of 26 December 2004, which caused severe damage along the south west coast of India has been studied. Wave <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> for the possible wave directions indicate convergence around the places like Kolachel, around Kollam and Alappuzha, where greater destructions occurred due to this tsunami and divergence at the places spared by the tsunami. Broad areas vulnerable to tsunamis have been identified. Possible causes for increased destruction in Kolachel at {{the southern tip of}} Indian peninsula are discussed. Bottom topography is one of the factors that determine the intensity of the tsunami waves. Bottom steering is caused by the wave refraction. Comparatively gentler sloping topography in a zone north of Kollam at depths beyond 200 m and the topographic dome off Kollam appear to have influence on determining the impact of tsunamis...|$|R
40|$|Very small tsunami was {{generated}} by the main shock (M= 6. 7) in an earthquake swarm off Ito, {{the east side of}} Izu Peninsula, on June 29, 1980. The maximum double amplitude of 56 cm for a period of 3. 5 min was observed at Okada, Izu-Oshima Island, while those at other tide stations in Sagami Bay were about 10 cm. Tsunami magnitude of the Imamura-Iida scale is m= - 1. 5. The source area of tsunami inferred from the inverse <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> agrees well with the earthquake swarm. The source area extends 17 km in the N 20 °W direction. Judging from the initial motion of tsunami on the records, an uplift of several centimeters may have occurred at the sea-bottom of the source area. The present tsunami had both a small wave-height and source dimension, just like other Izu tsunamis in 1974 and 1978...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe direction of sand movement along the Carmel River State Beach was qualitatively determined by diving observations, a bathymetric survey, wave <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> and a sediment size analysis of 18 samples. The {{primary source of}} sediments for the beach {{appears to be the}} Carmel River which flows only seasonally. Sedimentary material is introduced into the bay after winter precipitation provides a sufficient amount of run-off to warrant the opening of the river mouth by bulldozer. The fine sedimentary material is lost offshore and the coarser material is either redeposited on the beach or is carried south with the littoral drift and deposited at the nodal point in the sand transport pattern. This node is located on the northern edge of the head of the Carmel Submarine Canyon. Winter storms probably induce slumping or gravity sliding and much of the material is carried to deeper water by the canyon. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|For seven tsunamis {{which reached}} {{the coast of}} Japan, from Iturup, Kamchatka, Aleutian, Alaska and Chile, the {{distribution}} of tsunami energy are shown along the isobathymetric line of 200 m. As compared with the distribution, given by R. Takahasi(1951), for tsunamis originated in the sea adjacent to Japan, the patterns of energy distribution are approximately similar to each other. The regions in Sanriku and Kishu receive high {{percentage of the total}} energy of the tsunami. The ratio between heights of the initial wave and the maximum wave seems to increase with decreasing seiche period of the bay. Along the Sanriku coast, the tsunami is always high because of particular geographical conditions, concentrated wave energy by refraction, and amplifying by coastal effects. <b>Refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> in the adjacent sea of Japan are drawn with the aid of arrival times of the wave fronts observed by the tide-gauge stations. 日本に伝播した 7 個の遠地津波(浪源:Iturup, Kamchatka, Aleutian, AlaskaおよびChile) について,日本太平洋沿岸に沿つた 200 m等深線上に津波エネルギー分布を求め,高橋(1951) が示した近地津波の総エネルギー分布と比較したとき,かなり傾向が相似し,三陸および紀州地域が受ける津波エネルギーの割合が他地域に比して大きい. 湾の周期特性と,湾口と湾奥の波高増幅度との関係について,渡辺(1964) は 1933 年の三陸津波と 1960 年のチリ津波との相沢を理論的に説明したが,概して遠地津波の場合,一観測点における最高波と第 1 波の波高比,すなわち波高の増幅度は,短周期のセイシュを持つ湾程,大きい...|$|R

For this study, a wave cliate odel based {{on the construction of}} ave refraction diagras relative to the current boundary conditions as defined and assumed to be valid for the five coastlines. Numerical modeling from the <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> was carried out considering the angle of incidence and wave height along the coastline. This work has allowed us to reproduce past and current patterns of net longshore sediment drift defined by a conceptual model developed from the integration of sediment cores, aerial photograph interpretation, C 14 datings and geomorphic indicators of longshore drift. These results show that, on average, current wave conditions in the east-northeastern Brazilian region seem to have remained characteristically the same from approximately 5100 years BP until the present time. This type of information can be important when attempting to simulate possible future situations in terms of the long-term general behavior of the east-northeastern Brazilian coastal region...|$|R
40|$|Swansea Bay may {{be taken}} {{as an example of}} an embayment which has a complex and {{variable}} hydrodynamic regime resulting from the interaction of its bathymetry and configuration with an adjacent rectilinear, semidiurnal tidal system and with superimposed oceanic swell and more locally generated seas. Eulerian tidal current observations in Swansea Bay indicated a coastal tidal current pattern which has developed from the main currents along the northern Bristol Channel. The observed pattern consists of an anticlockwise eddy {{in the western part of}} the embayment and a zone of divergence on the eastern side, between the eddy and the main offshore flow. Wave data, as represented by <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> and the distribution of sea bed orbital velocities, have demonstrated that high energy wave conditions prevail over the area. Sediment distribution and transport in Swansea Bay are controlled by tidally and wave-induced current patterns, but are also related to bathymetry and the exposure of relict deposits.

40|$|Modern {{and ancient}} environments {{associated}} with Lakes Algoma and Huron were studied according to attributes of stratigraphy, sediment texture, parameters, sediment size distribution, bedforms, and primary sedimentary structures. Results from a computation of wave <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> and from {{an examination of}} the wave climate characteristics indicate that the modern embayment is low energy. A sediment texture comparison between modern and ancient environments indicates that higher energy pervailed in the ancient environment relative to the present day environment. The cobble and gravel sediments as well as an extensive belt of foredunes preserved in the ancient environment are evidence of this high energy. Sediment textural parameters of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis were combined in bivariate plots to test their reliability for discriminating between environments. Results from four combinations of those parameters were not totally favourable. Only a plot of standard deviation versus skewness proved useful. Component populations are useful discriminators of depositional environments. Inferred environments of beach, fluvial, and dune as well as modern lacustrine sediments could be identified by the characteristics of their component population curves. Moreover, characteristic curves that represent various subenvironments for the modern near shore zone are evident. These have been assimilated into a grain size distribution facies indicator. Provision of a facies model for a barred-lacustrine bayhead was made possible by an examination of preserved bedforms and primary sedimentary structures. High energy bedforms of parallel laminae and massive bedding are always preserved to low energy ripple cross-laminae. The sequence of ripple cross-laminae that forms in response to increasing energy as as follows: symmetrical, assymetrical, oscillatory, and combined flow. An examination of such preserved features yields information {{that can be used to}} decipher flow directions, energy gradients, and flow characteristics within specific subenvironments...|$|R
40|$|Based on tide-gauge {{records of}} Japan and other {{far-field}} data, the magnitudes of the Kurile-Kamchatka tsunamis {{during the past}} 77 years (1904 - 1980) are investigated. The features of a few tsunamis differ greatly. For example, the Kamchatka tsunami of Apr. 13, 1923 and the Kurile tsunami of Oct. 20, 1963 which accompanied earthquakes with magnitudes of M= 7. 2 - 7. 3 inundated the coastal areas near the tsunami source 10 - 20 meters. According to the author's method based on the attenuation of wave-height with distance, the magnitudes (Imamura-Iida scale, m) of these tsunamis {{are estimated to be}} m= 2. 5 and 2 respectively. The magnitudes of several tsunamis judged from the near-field and far-field data were a little different. At the Hokkaido and Sanriku coasts, North Japan, the waveheights (above ordinary tides) for the Kurile tsunamis with m= 2. 5 - 3 were 1. 0 - 1. 5 meters and 0. 5 meters respectively. However, the distribution of the wave-heights for the Kamchatka tsunami was different. The wave-heights on the Sanriku coast were greater than those on Hokkaido. The great 1952 Kamchatka tsunami (m= 4) inundated the Sanriku coast 2 - 3 meters. The wave-heights increased especially in the bays with the seiche of 43 min and 20 min. In the map of the source distribution, a tsunami (seismic) gap of 400 - 500 km exists along the trench in the North Kurile and West Aleutian Islands regions. In order to predict the travel times of tsunami along the Kurile and Japanese coasts, the <b>refraction</b> <b>diagrams</b> of two imaginary sources are drawn. 1900 年以降の 80 数年の間に,千島・カムチャツカ沖でおきた津波は,日本沿岸各地でしばしば観測され,ときには北海道・三陸や小笠原請島に被害をもたらした. ことに 1952 年 11 月のカムチャツカ津波では,三陸沿岸で 2 ～ 3 mの波高(平均海水面上) に達し,沿岸水産施設の災害のほか家屋の浸水被害もあって,遠地津波の挙動に注目を集めた最初の津波である. これらの津波規模を日本の検潮記録をはじめ,遠隔地で得られた波高データから,筆者の方法で検討を加えた. 1975 年 6 月の色丹島沖地震(M= 7. 0) で予想をこえる大きい津波を記録したが,そのほかに異常な津波が 2 ～ 3 ある. 例えば, 1923 年 4 月のカムチャッカ, 1963 年 10 月 20 日のウルップ津波は局地的に 10 ～ 15 mの波高に達したが,広域の波高データから津波のマグニチュード(今村・飯田スケール) は,m= 2. 0 ～ 2. 5 と推定される. それにしても地震の規模(M= 7. 2 ～ 7. 3) に対して,津波は異常に大きい. Fedotov,Soloviev,羽鳥の解析データから,千島・カムチャッカ地域における波源域の分布を示した. 多くの地震学者が指摘しているように,千島北部とアリューシャン列島西部に 400 ～ 500 kmにわたる広域に,地震空白域が認められる. 両地域に長さ 400 kmの津波の波源を想定して,伝播図を作図してみた. それによると,三陸沿岸の伝播時間は千島北部からのものが 1. 5 時間,アリューシャン西部からでは 3. 0 時間になる. そして三陸沿岸には,波面はいずれも同じような向きになった. 津波の指向性を考えれば,アリューシャン西部からの津波は,波源の短軸方向から伝播することから,三陸沿岸では千島北部のものより波高は大きくなるであろう 1952 年カムチャッカ津波の挙動からみて,津波エネルギーは北海道よりむしろ三陸沿岸に集まる. また,波源の長さが 400 kmにもなれば,港湾のセイシュ周期 40 ～ 45 分の大型湾に顕著な波高の増幅がおこされよう...|$|R
