40|$|<b>Repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> have lately {{emerged as}} key {{components}} of genome, performing varieties of roles. It has now become necessary to have an account of repeats for every genome to understand its dynamics and state. Recently, genomes of two major Solanaceae species, Solanum tuberosum and Solanum lycopersicum, were sequenced. These species are important crops having high commercial significance as well as value as model species. However, there is a reasonable gap in information about <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> and their possible roles in genome regulation for these species. The present study was aimed at detailed identification and characterization of complex <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> in these genomes, along with study of their possible functional associations {{as well as to}} assess possible transcriptionally active <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements.</b> In this study, it was found that ~ 50 - 60 % of genomes of S. tuberosum and S. lycopersicum were composed of <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements.</b> It was also found that complex <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> were associated with > 95 % of genes in both species. These two genomes are mostly composed of LTR retrotransposons. Two novel repeat families very similar to LTR/ERV 1 and LINE/RTE-BovB have been reported for the first time. Active existence of complex repeats was estimated by measuring their transcriptional abundance using Next Generation Sequencing read data and Microarray platforms.

40|$|Abstract Background Populus trichocarpa is {{the first}} tree genome to be completed, and its whole genome is {{currently}} being assembled.

Results We predicted 9, 623 <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> in the Populus trichocarpa genome, and assigned functions to 3, 075 of them (31. 95 %). The 9, 623 <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements</b> cover ~ 40 % of the current (partially) assembled genome. Among the 9, 623 <b>repetitive</b> <b>elements,</b> 668 have copies only in the contigs {{that have not been}} assigned to one of the 19 chromosome while the rest all have copies in the partially assembled chromosomes.
