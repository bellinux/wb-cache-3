5|$|In mid-2000 the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) {{invited a}} team from King's College London to conduct a study of East Timor's {{security}} force options. The team's report identified three options for an East Timorese military. Option1 was based on FALINTIL's preference for a relatively large and heavily armed military of 3,000–5,000 personnel, option2 was a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 conscripts and option3 was for a force of 1,500 regulars and 1,500 volunteer reservists.
