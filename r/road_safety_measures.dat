However, such non-monetary metrics have limited usefulness for evaluating policies with substantially different outcomes.

The campaign aims to raise public awareness of the scale of the road injury problem and to present this as a key issue for sustainable development. The Make Roads Safe campaign argues that tackling road injuries is vital for achieving many of the Millennium Development Goals, including targets for child mortality and health and education targets, because of the vital role played by access to roads in delivering these services. The campaign claims that, although the G8 has approved $1.2 billion for new road infrastructure in Africa, only $20 million has been allocated for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> The campaign argues that at least 10% of this infrastructure budget, and the similar budgets deployed worldwide by the World Bank, regional development banks and other donors, should be dedicated to <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>measures.</b> If this principle was accepted in the case of Africa it would mean $120 million would be available for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>measures</b> such as safety assessments of road design, enforcement and education strategies.|$|E
