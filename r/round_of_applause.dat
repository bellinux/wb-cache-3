5|$|After {{the band}} had walked offstage, {{in a move}} {{described}} by NME as the most meaningful of the concert, the audience faced the troops in the stadium and broke into a spontaneous <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause,</b> which quickly turned into an ovation—an act which the soldiers mimicked in turn.|$|E
5|$|A {{local radio}} show {{schedules}} {{an interview with}} Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to discuss Dunder Mifflin, but, unbeknown to Dwight, the interview is later canceled. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) suggests they all use this to their advantage, and stage an interview for Dwight's benefit. Dwight believes he is talking to the interviewer through {{the phone in the}} break room, but is actually talking to Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) who is using an American accent. They convince him that the information he is giving leads to a hostage situation with CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) cornered in his house. Dwight calls David and tries to talk him into surrendering to the police. David is confused but nonetheless responds in a way that leads Dwight to believe he was successful. He emerges from the break room and is greeted by a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from his coworkers.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, Australia batted with ease, as the {{overcast}} skies {{cleared and}} sun came out. The debutant Allan Watkins opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall {{blow to the}} shoulder became too much. The openers passed England's first innings total with ease {{in less than an}} hour, and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47. The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to Eric Hollies for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes. This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day. As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement {{after the end of the}} series, the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket. Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers, before shaking his hand. The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100, but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball duck with a googly that went between bat and pad. Bradman received another large <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> as he left the arena.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. MURRAY, {{on being}} requested, sung [...] "'Twas merry in the hall," [...] {{and at the}} {{conclusion}} was greeted with repeated <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... his delineations of {{the various}} {{characters}} (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b> Possesed <b>of</b> a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, {{he was able to}} mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility.|$|R
50|$|Noted for her vocal {{purity and}} coloratura precision, {{she was one}} of the most famous French singers of her day. She often {{encouraged}} composers to write their scores that would showcase her vocal technique. Because of this, she was well known for keeping audiences attentive and large <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|R
5|$|In 2013–14, Lin was {{replaced}} in the Rockets' starting lineup by Patrick Beverley, and Lin became the second unit's primary ball handler and scoring option as the team's sixth man. Houston liked beginning games with Beverley's defensive pressure, but also preferred increasing Lin's playing time without Harden {{also on the}} court. Lin and Harden were both attacking players offensively, but each struggled defensively. In November, Lin established the highest two-game scoring total of his career, 65 points, including season-highs of 34 points and 11 assists along with a Rockets record-tying nine three-pointers in a start in place of an injured Harden. It {{was followed by a}} 21-point performance in a win at New York. He received a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> upon entering the game, though it was more subdued than in his first return against the Knicks. On November 27, Lin sprained his right knee against the Atlanta Hawks, causing him to miss six games. He missed four additional games in December due to back spasms; he started in his return on December 23 with both Harden and Beverley injured—Beverley was estimated to be out four to six weeks due to a fractured right hand. On February 1, 2014, Lin recorded 15 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists—his first career triple-double—in 29 minutes off the bench in a 106–92 home victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers. He was the first Rocket to notch a triple-double off the bench since Cedric Maxwell in 1988. However, he went into a shooting slump after the All-Star break, and again experienced problems with his back.|$|E

25|$|In the {{following}} days, tributes {{were made for}} him at professional races, first at the Tour of Croatia {{the next day with}} a minute's silence, and then the Liège–Bastogne–Liège the day after with a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b> In both races riders wore black armbands. Alejandro Valverde won Liège–Bastogne–Liège and gave his prize money to Scarponi's family. Former teammate and close friend Vincenzo Nibali dedicated his overall victory of the Tour of Croatia to Scarponi. A minute's silence was also observed before the Juventus–Genoa Serie A football match in Turin. His funeral took place on 25 April at Filottrano's football stadium, attended by an estimated 5,000 mourners. The service was officiated by cardinal Edoardo Menichelli.|$|E
5000|$|Jean Hannon and Angela Egan had Dublin {{two goals}} up within three {{minutes of the}} start of the final. Eveleen O'Beirne pulled a goal back for Galway but they never recovered. The Connacht Sentinel {{reported}} that Galway “were best served by Jo Melvin in the goal who drew frequent <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> for her saves.” ...|$|R
60|$|As he concluded, the deacon {{walked with}} a majestic bearing down to the bewildered boys, {{presented}} each with a well-filled pocketbook and then waved his hand as a signal for the band, every member of which {{did his best to}} make the music heard above the <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> intended for the blushing fakirs.|$|R
5000|$|... 1965 - The senior wing, new gym, and {{cafeteria}} were constructed, {{creating the}} courtyard. An official dedication ceremony {{was held for}} Baker High School. The first African-American students, Robert Leonard and Larry Smith, were admitted. Leonard was remembered for the [...] "Cassius Clay" [...] skit, and for getting one <b>of</b> the loudest <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> at graduation. Smith was on the State Championship-winning track team.|$|R
25|$|Having deputised for Michael Vaughan as England {{captain in}} 2006, Strauss was {{appointed}} {{on a permanent}} basis for the 2008–09 tour of the West Indies following Kevin Pietersen's resignation. He enjoyed success with three centuries, and retained the captaincy into 2009. Strauss captained the England team to a 2–1 victory in the 2009 Ashes, scoring a series total of 474 runs, {{more than any other}} player on either side, including 161 in England's first victory in an Ashes Test at Lord's in 75 years. He held the record for most catches by an outfield player for England – going past Botham and Cowdrey at Lords against South Africa in 2012 – until he was in turn overtaken by Alistair Cook. He relinquished the Test captaincy and retired from all forms of professional cricket on 29 August 2012, following his 100th test, which concluded a series defeat by South Africa that saw the England Test team lose their number one ranking. He left the job the second most successful captain of the English modern era in terms of wins, second only to his old opening partner Michael Vaughan. At the end of his retirement press conference he received an unprecedented <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the assembled media.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals′ {{attempt to}} honor the Montreal-Washington franchise′s entire history in the Ring of Honor, {{as well as by}} {{tracking}} Montreal-Washington franchise records, is not without controversy. Although Nationals fans generally take little interest in the franchise′s Montreal years, some do appreciate acknowledging that the franchise has a history that predates its arrival in Washington, and former Expo Tim Raines received a warm <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from fans at Nationals Park at his induction ceremony on August 28, 2017, even though he had never even visited Washington, D.C., before, let alone played baseball there. Some Montreal Expos fans express appreciation that the Nationals are honoring the Expos, and Expos players inducted into the Ring of Honor have expressed gratitude that the Nationals chose to include them, especially with no MLB team in Montreal {{to honor the}}ir careers. However, few Nationals fans have taken an interest in franchise records, preferring to compare Nationals records with those of previous Washington MLB teams instead, and a segment of Nationals fans actively opposes the inclusion of Expos history into that of the Nationals, taking the view that the Montreal years are irrelevant to Washington and that the team made a complete break with its past and started anew when it arrived in Washington, inheriting the history of the two Washington Senators teams rather than that of the Expos. Similarly, Montreal Expos fans have taken little or no interest in the achievements of Nationals players, and some Expos fans strongly oppose the inclusion of former Expos in the Ring, taking the position that to do so is to co-opt the history of the Expos, which they say belongs solely in Montreal.|$|E
25|$|The Top 3, Sophie, Bill and Fenton {{had just}} two final {{challenges}} to complete. The {{first was the}} last chance {{to work on their}} presenting skills with Mark and Julia. Mark held a Cue card which they were required to read while looking down the camera and deliver it with as much personality as possible. Mark was looking for someone with the ability to engage the audience. Bill and Sophie struggled with their delivery while big Fenton nailed it in one take, getting a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from both judges. Then it was off to one of Sydney's best fine dining experiences, Mint bar and dining. Once there they had one last attempt to impress 5 VIP's with a signature dish under the keen eye of Ben O'Donoghue. This showed another side of Ben that the contestants had yet to see, a no nonsense head chef barking orders at them in the kitchen and putting the pressure on to get the meals out as efficiently as possible. Sophie served up a very fresh and light Mexican chicken with a tasty salad including heart of palm and pistachio. The food critiques were very impressed. Next up Bill aimed to impress with his dish, crayfish cooked in herb butter and served with a salad. The reaction was the same all round from the judges, not good. The presentation was lacking and the salad didn't suit the dish. Owner of Mint remarked 'It's like two different dishes on one plate.' Finally Fenton from Queensland served up an eye fillet with hollandaise and potato rösti (a favourite at his restaurant.) While one judge thought the beef was the best stating 'he (Fenton) put his whole life on the BBQ and served it up for us.' it was Sophie's chicken that got the majority of the VIP judges vote and won her ticket through to the grand finale. That left Fenton and Bill. Ben then announced that Bill would be going home and Fenton was going through. But then in a final twist, Chef Ben O'Donoghue decided to bring Bill back because he felt that he had let him down with his direction in the kitchen. So the Top 2 was again the Top 3 with all contestants going into the final with the winner announced on Australia Day.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this, Rifkind {{went through}} to the 'conference stage' of the {{leadership}} process, in which each candidate was given speaking time to address the Conservative Party Conference directly. In his speech, Rifkind declared that Conservatives had to be [...] "pragmatic, sensitive and moderate", and stress their [...] "unique combination of principle and patriotism." [...] The speech won eight <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the conference, with nearly a minute-long finale.|$|R

500|$|Several {{members of}} Swift's family {{attended}} the February 2008 Manchester derby, {{played in the}} week of the 50th anniversary of the Munich air disaster. The game, at Old Trafford, was won by Manchester City; the minutes silence was fully observed by the Manchester City fans. Towards the end of the game, the City fans chanted [...] "There's only one Frank Swift" [...] several times, to <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the United fans.|$|R

500|$|After {{saying his}} {{individual}} goodbyes {{to many of}} the members of the 4077th, Hawkeye whispers to Henry and convinces him to give a long kiss to Margaret, generating another rousing <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the onlookers. Blake then leaves the camp, walking towards the chopper pad with Hawkeye, Trapper, Margaret, Frank, Klinger, Father Mulcahy (William Christopher), and Radar, with the rest of the camp saying farewells and singing [...] "For He's a Jolly Good Fellow".|$|E
2500|$|Hooker's [...] "blood boiled, I {{felt myself}} a dastard; now I saw my advantage–I swore to myself I would smite that Amalekite Sam hip and thigh", (he was invited {{up to the}} {{platform}} and) [...] "there and then I smacked him amid <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause...</b> proceeded to demonstrate... that he could never have read your book... {{wound up with a}} very few observations on the...old and new hypotheses...

50|$|Martov was {{described}} as being 'too good an intellectual {{to be a successful}} politician', as he often was held back by his integrity, and 'philosophical approach' to matters of politics. He tended to select political allies primarily by the 'coherence of their general worldview', instead of 'practicality' or 'timeliness'. His 'high minded approach' would later win <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> among the socialist intelligentsia. Nonetheless, Martov's noble principles made him too 'soft' and 'indecisive', at time when the opposite were politically required of him. He {{has been described as a}} 'brilliant intellectual and party theoretician'.|$|R
5000|$|Hooker's [...] "blood boiled, I {{felt myself}} a dastard; now I saw my advantage-I swore to myself I would smite that Amalekite Sam hip and thigh", (he was invited {{up to the}} {{platform}} and) [...] "there and then I smacked him amid <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause...</b> proceeded to demonstrate... that he could never have read your book... {{wound up with a}} very few observations on the...old and new hypotheses...

500|$|The {{next morning}} {{is the first}} with Frank Burns in charge, and he {{immediately}} starts using his [...] "gung-ho", militarily strict, and whistle-happy attitude to assemble the company. A lack of respect from his subordinates is already evident, as an out of uniform and unshaven Hawkeye and Trapper and an outrageously dressed (even for him) Corporal Klinger (Jamie Farr) {{show up for the}} assembly. As Blake leaves his tent for the last time, dressed in his new suit, he is greeted with a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the unit. Frank and Margaret give Blake a formal [...] "ten-hut" [...] salute. Henry, in his typical laid-back fashion, tells Frank to [...] "take it easy" [...] and to [...] "stuff that whistle someplace".|$|E
500|$|In contrast, Australia batted with {{apparent}} ease, as the overcast skies {{cleared and}} sun came out {{late on the}} first afternoon. The opening partnership had reached 117 before Hollies removed Barnes for 61. This brought Bradman to the crease shortly before 18:00. As Bradman had announced that the tour {{would be his last}} at international level, the innings would be his last at Test level if Australia batted only once. With 6,996 Test career runs, he only needed four runs to average 100.00 in Test cricket. On the second ball, [...] Hollies bowled Bradman for a duck with a googly that went between bat and pad as the Australian skipper leaned forward. Bradman appeared stunned and slowly turned around and walked back to the pavilion, receiving another large <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|E
500|$|Inherit the Wind {{began an}} {{enduring}} collaboration between Stanley Kramer and Tracy—Kramer directed Tracy's three final films. Judgment at Nuremberg, released {{at the end}} of 1961, was their second feature together. [...] The film depicts the [...] "Judges' Trial", the trial of Nazi judges for their role in the Holocaust. Abby Mann wrote the role of Judge Haywood with Tracy in mind; Tracy called it the best script he had ever read. At the end of the film, Tracy delivered a 13-minute speech. He recorded it in one take, and received a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause</b> from the cast and crew. Upon seeing the film, Mann wrote to Tracy: [...] "Every writer ought to have the experience of having Spencer Tracy do his lines. There is nothing in the world quite like it." [...] The film met with positive reviews and a large audience; Tracy received an eighth Oscar nomination for his performance.|$|E
6000|$|... "He-ar, he-ar!" [...] {{burst from}} the toady {{in spite of his}} recent rebuke; but as it was drowned in a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> hearty <b>applause</b> no one was the wiser or the worse of his note of approval.|$|R
50|$|The third {{subsection}} was {{the collection}} of various instruments into a musical ensemble, despite the unclear sound of the liras and the somewhat unblended voices. This produced such a <b>round</b> <b>of</b> open <b>applause</b> rarely is awarded even {{to the performance of}} the best symphonic orchestras.|$|R
6000|$|Ting, ting, ting! {{went the}} bell again. The curtain was violently convulsed, but rose no higher; the {{audience}} tittered; Mrs. Porter looked at Uncle Tom; Uncle Tom looked at everybody, rubbing his hands, and laughing with perfect rapture. After as much ringing {{with the little}} bell as a muffin-boy would make in going down a tolerably long street, and a vast deal of whispering, hammering, and calling for nails and cord, the curtain at length rose, and discovered Mr. Sempronius Gattleton solus, and decked for Othello. After three distinct <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause,</b> during which Mr. Sempronius applied his right hand to his left breast, and bowed in the most approved manner, the manager advanced and said: ...|$|R
500|$|The album's {{back cover}} depicts a faceless [...] "Floyd salesman", in Thorgerson's words, [...] "selling his soul" [...] {{in the desert}} (shot in the Yuma Desert in California again by Aubrey ' Po ' Powell). [...] The absence of wrists and ankles signifies his {{presence}} as an [...] "empty suit". [...] The inner sleeve shows a veil concealing a nude woman in a windswept Norfolk grove, and a splash-less diver at Mono Lake – titled Monosee (the German translation of Mono Lake) on the liner notes – in California (again emphasising the theme of absence). [...] The decision to shroud the cover in black plastic was not popular with the band's US record company, Columbia Records, who insisted that it be changed (they were overruled). EMI were less concerned; the band were reportedly extremely happy with the end product, and when presented with a pre-production mockup, they accepted it with a spontaneous <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|E
500|$|Although Illinois is {{a concept}} album about the U.S. state, Stevens also {{explored}} themes related to Christianity and the Bible. As a Christian, he has written and recorded music about spiritual themes throughout his career—particularly on the 2004 album Seven Swans—and prefers to talk about religious topics through song rather than directly in interviews or public statements. The song [...] "Decatur, or, <b>Round</b> <b>of</b> <b>Applause</b> for Your Stepmother!" [...] includes the line [...] "It's the great I Am"—taken from the response God gave when Moses asked for {{his name in the}} Book of Exodus (...) [...] [...] "Casimir Pulaski Day" [...] describes the death of a romantic partner due to bone cancer, and the narrator questions God in the process. More abstract allusions appear in [...] "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts", which utilizes Superman as a Christ figure and [...] "The Seer's Tower", which references the Book of Revelation and the Second Coming of Christ. Songs which were not written with an explicit theological focus—such as [...] "John Wayne Gacy, Jr."—also feature religious themes such as sin and redemption.|$|E
500|$|... "Casimir Pulaski Day" [...] interweaves a {{personal}} story {{with the state}} holiday Casimir Pulaski Day. [...] "The Man of Metropolis Steals Our Hearts" [...] makes references to Superman, whose fictional hometown of Metropolis was partially modeled after Chicago (the town of Metropolis, Illinois has also capitalized on this association). Jessica Hopper of the Chicago Reader noted that Ray Middleton—who was the first actor to play the comic book superhero—was also born in Chicago. [...] "They Are Night Zombies!! They Are Neighbors!! They Have Come Back from the Dead!! Ahhhh!" [...] makes references to ghost towns of Illinois. Stevens relates experiences from a summer camp he went to {{as a child in}} Michigan for [...] "The Predatory Wasp of the Palisades Is Out to Get Us!", but moved the locale to Illinois {{for the sake of the}} album. The track [...] "Decatur, or, <b>Round</b> <b>of</b> <b>Applause</b> for Your Stepmother!" [...] includes references to Decatur, Illinois, but Stevens stated the track also acted as [...] "an exercise in rhyme schemes". Some references to Decatur included in the song were alligator sightings in the area, the equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, and a flood that exhumed a graveyard of soldiers from the Civil War.|$|E
60|$|Mannering, who {{had stood}} at first {{uncertain}} whether to advance or retreat, now resolved to enter {{for the moment}} into the whim of the scene, though internally fretting at Mac-Morlan for sending him to consult with a crack-brained humourist. He therefore advanced with three profound congees, and craved permission to lay his credentials {{at the feet of}} the Scottish monarch, in order to be perused at his best leisure. The gravity with which he accommodated himself to the humour of the moment, and the deep and humble inclination with which he at first declined, and then accepted, a seat presented by the master of the ceremonies, procured him three <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b>|$|R
60|$|There were <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause.</b> Every one {{stood up}} and held out their glasses towards him, and Jacob was forced back again into this very real world {{of men and women}} made {{comfortable}} in their daily lives by his efforts. He said his few words of thanks simply but gracefully and, in accordance with the programme of the day, they trooped out afterwards to the lawn in front of the freshly plastered clubhouse and drank their coffee at small round tables, looking down the course, discussing the various holes, and making matches for the next Saturday afternoon and Sunday. A girl at the adjoining table leaned over and asked him a question.|$|R
50|$|When George Grenville, whose {{principles}} leaned to Toryism, quarrelled {{with the}} court, Wedderburn affected to regard {{him as his}} leader in politics. At the dissolution {{in the spring of}} 1768 he was returned by Sir Lawrence Dundas for Richmond as a Tory, but in the questions that arose over John Wilkes he took the popular side of Wilkes and liberty, and resigned his seat in May 1769. In the opinion of the people he was now regarded as the embodiment of all legal virtue; his health was toasted at the dinners of the Whigs amid <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>applause,</b> and, in recompense for the loss of his seat in parliament, he was returned by Lord Clive for his pocket-borough of Bishop's Castle, in Shropshire, in January 1770.|$|R
