5|$|Cracker Barrel {{was founded}} in 1969 by Dan Evins, a sales {{representative}} for Shell Oil, who developed the restaurant and gift store concept initially as a plan to improve gasoline sales. Designed to resemble the traditional country store that he <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> his childhood, with a name chosen {{to give it a}} Southern country theme, Cracker Barrel was intended to attract the interest of highway travelers. The first restaurant was built close to Interstate 40, in Lebanon, Tennessee. It opened in September 1969, serving Southern cuisine including biscuits, grits, country ham, and turnip greens.|$|E

5|$|In December 940, al-Radi died. Bajkam {{remained}} at Wasit, but sent his secretary to Baghdad to convene a council of Abbasid aristocrats, who selected al-Muttaqi (r. 940–944), al-Radi's brother, as Caliph. Bajkam also sent a slave named Takinak to the deceased Caliph's palace, the Dar al-Sultan, to procure various items, including the valuable al-Yatimah pearl. He also obtained three female slaves from al-Radi's palace, whose singing he <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> his earlier {{visits to the}} Caliph.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, John Mulvihill, who {{operated}} the Red Fox Inn at the Kerry Bog Village in Glenbeigh, County Kerry, began {{a search for}} remnants of the Kerry Bog Pony population, despite reports that the breed was extinct. He eventually found 20 ponies that resembled those he <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> his childhood, and removed them from the bog to his stables. In 1995, he had blood typing performed on the ponies by Weatherby's Ireland, which identified their DNA markers. Subsequent DNA testing showed them to be a unique breed that formed a separate population from other local ponies and from other breeds in Ireland and Great Britain. Of these 20 ponies, only one was a stallion, named Flashy Fox. Between 1995 and 2012, he sired more than 140 foals, and {{played a significant role}} in repopulating the breed.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some Kind of War Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E

25|$|Since {{they were}} not trained in {{building}} design, the padres could only try to emulate the architectural aspects of structures they <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> their homeland. The missions exhibit a strong Roman influence in much of their design and construction techniques (as do many buildings in Spain), particularly in arch and dome construction. At Mission Santa Barbara, founding Father Ripali {{even went so far}} as to consult the works of 1st century B.C. Roman architect Vitruvius during the design phase of the project.|$|E
25|$|Galis {{also led}} Greece {{to the second}} place at the EuroBasket 1989, {{averaging}} 35.6 points per game. Galis is most <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> that tournament, for a stunning effort against the Soviet team led by Marčiulionis, and its other star player, Arvydas Sabonis, in the semifinal game. He scored 45 out of his team's 81 total points in a dramatic, last-gasp 81–80 victory. The Greek team then settled for a second-place finish, after losing against the ever-dominant Yugoslavian national basketball team in the tournament's final.|$|E

Leaving a message on her own answering machine that she has the Zephyr, she is captured by Quintana's men and taken to Sevilla, Spain. She is drugged with a prototype truth serum before being rescued by Miller, who was tracking Fitzgerald, who was delivering Feck to Quintana.|$|E
25|$|After {{the failure}} of Chastity, my Brother, Travers {{returned}} to comedy, though not immediately to farce. Later in 1936 his O Mistress Mine was a light Ruritanian vehicle for Yvonne Printemps. He returned to farce with Banana Ridge (1938) in which Robertson Hare starred with Alfred Drayton. It was set in Malaya, and turned on which of two middle-aged pillars of Empire {{was the father of}} the young hero. Travers himself played the part of Wun, a servant; his lines in colloquial Malay, <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> his Malacca days, were improvised and sometimes took his colleagues by surprise. The play ran for 291 performances, bettering the runs of the last six Aldwych farces.|$|E
25|$|Also, the Catalogue of Ships {{mentions}} a {{great variety}} of cities, some of which, including Athens, were inhabited both in the Bronze Age and in Homer's time, and some of which, such as Pylos, were not rebuilt after the Bronze Age. This suggests that the names of no-longer-existing towns were <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> an older time, because it is unlikely that Homer would have managed to name successfully a diverse list of important Bronze Age cities that were, in his time, only a few blocks of rubble on the surface, often without even names. Furthermore, the cities enumerated in the Catalogue are given in geographical clusters, this revealing a sound knowledge of Aegean topography. Some evidence is mixed, though: locating the Bronze Age palace of Sparta, the traditional home of Menelaus, under the modern city has been challenging.|$|E

25|$|The {{attack on}} Poland {{ended with the}} Nazi–Soviet victory parade in Brześć, which was held on 22 September 1939. Brześć was the {{location}} of the first Nazi-Soviet meeting organized on 27 September 1939, in which the prisoner exchange was decided prior to the signing of mutual agreements in Moscow a day later. In the following month, the Gestapo and the NKVD met in Lwów to discuss the fate of civilian populations during radical reorganization of the annexed territories. They met again in occupied Przemyśl at the end of November, because Przemyśl was a border crossing between the two invaders. The next series of meetings began in December 1939, a month after the first transfer of Polish prisoners of war. The conferences were held in occupied Kraków in the General Government on 6–7 December 1939; and continued for the next two days in the resort town of Zakopane in the Tatra Mountains of southern Poland (100km from Kraków) on 8–9 December 1939. The Zakopane Conference is the most <b>remembered.</b> <b>From</b> the Soviet side, several higher officers of the NKVD secret police participated in the meetings, while the German hosts provided a group of experts from the Gestapo.|$|E

500|$|The city of Alamogordo {{was founded}} in June 1898, when the El Paso and Northeastern Railroad, headed by Charles Bishop Eddy, {{extended}} the railway to the town. Eddy influenced {{the design of the}} community, which included large wide thoroughfares and tree-lined irrigation canals. Charles Eddy's brother John Arthur Eddy named the new city Alamogordo ("large/fat cottonwood" [...] in Spanish) after a grove of fat cottonwoods he <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> the Pecos River area. When Alamogordo was laid out in 1898, the east-west streets were given numerical designations, while north-south streets were named after states. The present-day White Sands Boulevard was then called Pennsylvania Avenue.|$|E

500|$|According to postwar testimonies, when {{transports}} were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote {{lyrics to}} a song meant {{to celebrate the}} Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned {{to work in the}} Sonderkommando. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. Unterscharführer Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: [...] "We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time. Hurray!" ...|$|E
500|$|Sheen {{worked with}} an accent coach to {{effectively}} mimic Blair's speech style, although he and Morrissey avoided doing simple impersonations {{of the men}} they played. Sheen cited Will Smith's title performance of Ali {{as a basis for}} his part; despite playing a real-life figure, he treated the role as if it were any other character. Sheen had made his film debut in Frears' Mary Reilly (1996), and although he was unsure whether his minor role had [...] "burned into [...] brain", Frears confirmed that Sheen had <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> that. Frears' casting director approached Sheen in the audience of a play, inviting him to appear in [...] "a love story about Tony Blair and Gordon Brown". An informal meeting was scheduled between Frears and Sheen, {{at the end of which}} Sheen was cast as Blair.|$|E
500|$|Southdale Center was {{developed}} by the Dayton Company and designed by Victor Gruen, an Austrian immigrant and socialist. Gruen was a European-style socialist; he found individual stores in downtown venues to be inefficient, and the suburban lifestyle of 1950s America too [...] "car-centric" [...] and wanted to design a building that would be a communal gathering place, where people would shop, drink coffee, and socialize, as he <b>remembered</b> <b>from</b> his native Vienna. Southdale Center was loosely modeled on the arcades of several heavily populated European cities and purposely included [...] "eye-level display cases" [...] to [...] "lure customers into stores". Gruen imaged that Southdale would eventually include [...] "a medical center, schools and residences, not just a parade of glitzy stores." [...] The first plans unveiled for the shopping center were announced in 1952 by Gruen and Minnesota native, Donald Dayton.|$|E
