On the other hand, the environmental and life-quality degradation was in the negative balance.After the 1974 flood the Tubarão river was deeply modified.

Material that is rejected from their mining operations due to its incompatible chemistry is currently being stockpiled against mine depletion. Recent interest in recuperating nickel from this <b>reject</b> <b>material</b> led to {{the examination of the}} suitability of carbothermic reduction followed by magnetic separation for nickel recovery from this reject ore. Five parameters were considered in a Design of Experiment framework, namely: heating time; temperature; material type, coke addition and oxygen partial pressure. Magnetic separation was conducted with a Davis Tube and a low intensity hand magnet. It was found that this <b>reject</b> <b>material</b> can successfully be treated using a carbothermic reduction process to produce 50 to 75 mum diameter metallic components within a gangue matrix. The recovery of nickel ranged from 61. 7 % to 21. 9 % to 16. 4 % in the high, low and non magnetic fractions, respectively, separated from the reduced material. The grade of nickel ranged from 1. 97 wt% Ni to 1. 58 % to 0. 75 wt% Ni in the high, low and non magnetic fractions, respectively. Heating temperature had the greatest positive influence on the performance of the process followed by material type and heating time.

Stover, consisting of above-ground corn plant material other than grain (MOG), is baled at harvest and stored on-farms. Stored bales can deteriorate during storage resulting in reject stover unworthy of processing. Bales, that meet the ethanol conversion quality standards, are transported to the processing facility to prepare stover for the ethanol conversion process. Bales, consisting of stover and loose soil, are subjected to grinding and sieving to separate soil from stover, thereby, producing soil stover as a <b>reject</b> <b>material</b> excluded from the ethanol conversion process. Compostable characteristics of reject stover and soil stover, in terms of bulk density, free air space, total carbon, total nitrogen, total ash, organic matter content, moisture content, and air-filled porosity will be presented in this paper. Compost trials (n= 3) are planned to be conducted in July 2 ̆ 6 August 2017 using reject stover and soil stover under three different treatments of total carbon to total nitrogen ratios and two different particle sizes of reject stover (as-is and particle size reduced to less than 5 -cm).

Results of these trials in terms of carbon di-oxide evolution rates and changes in physical properties of bulk density, free air space, and air-filled porosity will be presented.

Slop waste (either 10 %, 15 % or 20 %wt) was added as a binder. The solid fuel briquettes were formed into cylindrical shapes 3. 8 cm in external diameter, 1. 3 cm in internal diameter and 15 cm in length. The briquettes were evaluated for the following properties: moisture, ash, volatile matter, fixed carbon, calorific value, sulfur, combustion calorific value, compressive strength, water resistance, and bulk density. The experimental results indicated that calorific value and combustion calorific value of the solid fuel briquettes increased with increasing ratios of sawdust char. Compressive strength, water resistance and bulk density of the solid fuel briquettes also increased, and depended both on increased ratios of sawdust char and on {{a higher percentage of}} binder. From the research results, it can be concluded that a MWCC to SC ratio of 20 : 80 with 20 % slop waste was most suitable for production of solid fuel briquettes. This study demonstrates that the <b>rejected</b> <b>material</b> of municipal waste composting can be used as an alternative fuel for industrial use.

40|$|Pulp {{and paper}} {{industries}} face tremendous problems in eliminating waste, {{which is in}} the form of sludge, wood, and <b>reject</b> <b>material.</b> Although incineration is seen as the most effective solution, this unfortunately leaves large quantities of residues such as fly ash and bottom ash. The ashes are alumino-silicate materials, which are excellent candidates for producing both glasses and glass ceramic materials. In the present work, samples of pulp and paper incinerator residues were collected and the initial characteristics (moisture content, loss on ignition, particle size and size distribution, chemical composition) were analyzed. The major oxides were found to fall within the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 -CaO (CAS) system. Moreover, nucleating agents such as TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, Cr 2 O 3 and P 2 O 5 were also present in the glass. Through thermal analysis (TGA and DTA) optimum heating schedules were selected for producing glass ceramic materials. It was found that the optimum devitrification temperature for fly ash was 1200 °C and the final product contained anorthite with/without albite.

The objective of this work was to investigate the performance of S/S waste binder systems containing these two waste materials (rFA and FGD). Strength tests show that cement-based waste forms with rFA and FGD replacement were suitable for disposal in landfills. The addition of an appropriate quantity of Ca(OH) 2 and FGD reduces the deleterious effect of heavy metals on strength development. Results of TCLP testing and the progressive TCLP test show that cement-rFA-Ca(OH) 2 systems with a range of FGD additions can form an effective S/S binder.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{representations of}} heteronormativity (and its influence) across {{several kinds of}} literature aimed at a child (and sometimes adult) audience, and does so by examining relationships between language and sexuality. The study firstly focuses {{on the study of}} English as a Foreign Language (EFL) textbooks, giving an overview of research from the literature. The authors look at heteronormativity in these overtly pedagogical texts and consider some implications for textbook writers and analysts when challenging predominantly heteronormative representations of sexuality in these texts. The authors then consider representations of sexuality in children's fiction. The prevalence of heteronormativity in the Harry Potter series is considered in relation to broad aspects of identity (gender, sexuality, class). Heteronormativity vis à vis homonormativity is then discussed in relation to the analysis of a large collection of picturebooks featuring same-sex parents, the results of which suggest that, although gay and lesbian parents feature as central characters, the manner of representation largely reflects heteronormative relationships and parenting discourses. The paper concludes by identifying challenges, in particular for EFL textbook writers and publishers. Producers of these texts have to consider a global audience part of whom is likely to <b>reject</b> <b>material</b> that offers alternatives to heteronormativity.
