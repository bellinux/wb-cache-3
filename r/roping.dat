5|$|Because of the breeds {{that make}} up the Azteca, they are known for their athleticism. They have been seen in {{competition}} in western riding events such as reining, cutting, team penning and <b>roping,</b> as well as English riding events such as dressage and other events such as polo and bullfighting. They are also used for pleasure riding.|$|E
5|$|Outside of breed-specific shows, the Saddlebred is also {{promoted}} as suitable for competitive trail riding, endurance riding, dressage, combined driving, eventing, and show jumping. Some Saddlebreds are also suitable for fox hunting, cutting and <b>roping.</b> Because {{they are so}} closely affiliated with their traditional show ring competition, they are sometimes mistaken for warmbloods or Thoroughbred crosses when participating in other equine events. They are also suitable family horses used for trail and pleasure riding and ranch work.|$|E
50|$|Rock {{climbing}} <b>ropes</b> {{come with}} either a designation for single, double or twin use. A single <b>rope</b> {{is the most common}} and it is intended to be used by itself, as a single strand. Single <b>ropes</b> range in thickness from roughly 9mm to 11mm. Smaller <b>ropes</b> are lighter, but wear out faster. Double <b>ropes</b> are thinner <b>ropes,</b> usually 9mm and under, and are intended for use as a pair. These <b>ropes</b> offer a greater margin or security against cutting, since it is unlikely that both <b>ropes</b> will be cut, but they complicate belaying and leading. Double <b>ropes</b> are usually reserved for ice and mixed climbing, where there is need for two <b>ropes</b> to rappel or abseil. They are also popular among traditional climbers, and particularly in the UK, due to the ability to clip each <b>rope</b> into alternating pieces of protection; allowing the <b>ropes</b> to stay straighter and hence reduce <b>rope</b> drag.Twin <b>ropes</b> are {{not to be confused with}} doubles. When using twin <b>ropes,</b> both <b>ropes</b> are clipped into the same piece of protection, treating the two as a single strand. This would be favourable in a situation where there was a high chance of a <b>rope</b> being cut. However new lighter-weight <b>ropes</b> with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of <b>rope.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Ropes</b> {{used for}} {{climbing}} {{can be divided}} into two classes: dynamic <b>ropes</b> and low elongation <b>ropes</b> (sometimes called [...] "static" [...] <b>ropes).</b> Dynamic <b>ropes</b> are designed to absorb the energy of a falling climber, and are usually used as Belaying <b>ropes.</b> When a climber falls, the <b>rope</b> stretches, reducing the maximum force experienced by the climber, their belayer, and equipment. Low elongation <b>ropes</b> stretch much less, and are usually used in anchoring systems. They are also used for abseiling (rappelling) and as fixed <b>ropes</b> climbed with ascenders.|$|R

5|$|At {{approximately}} 3:30am 20 SEALs {{and about}} 24 US Army Rangers from the 75th Ranger Regiment (wearing night-vision goggles) approached the compound, fast <b>roping</b> from two CH-47 Chinook helicopters.

Two American snipers aboard a helicopter killed two guards using sound-suppressed rifles. An AC-130 Spectre gunship provided the US {{troops on the ground}} with close air support, killing two fleeing Taliban. The Rangers secured enemy positions on the nearby hills, and all six Taliban gunmen who fought the US forces were killed.|$|E

5|$|The walrus and {{polar bear}} hunts were filmed in July 1932 at Herald Island in the Chukchi Sea. Walrus {{carcasses}} {{were used as}} dog food and to attract polar bears. Additional polar bear hunting was filmed in March 1933 off Cape Lisburne. The bowhead whale hunt was filmed from late April to July 1933 in two locations: Off Point Hope, Alaska, and off Cape Serdtse-Kamen on the Chukchi Peninsula. The whale hunting shoot took nearly three months because the whales kept fleeing every time they spotted boats. As depicted in the film, the Inupiat also hunted polar bears by <b>roping</b> and drowning them, but little of this footage {{made it into the}} picture.|$|E
5|$|Western gunslinger {{heroes are}} portrayed as local lawmen or {{enforcement}} officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle - courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering {{from place to place}} with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (<b>roping,</b> gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.).|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk {{produced}} about 50 films {{throughout his}} lifetime. He developed {{an interest in}} the cinema at a young age, which he attributed to frequent trips to the cinema with his parents. Shortly after becoming king in 1941, Sihanouk made a few amateur films, and sent Cambodian students to study film-making in France. When the film Lord Jim was released in 1965, Sihanouk was vexed with the negative portrayal it gave of Cambodia. In response, Sihanouk produced his first feature film, Apsara, in 1966. He went on to produce, direct, and act in eight more films between 1966 and 1969, <b>roping</b> in {{members of the royal family}} and military generals to star in his films. Sihanouk expressed that his films were created with the intent of portraying Cambodia in a positive light; Milton Osborne also noted that the films were filled with Cold War and nationalist propaganda themes. Sihanouk's former adviser, Charles Meyer, said that his films created from the 1960s were of amateur standard, while the director of Reyum Institute, Ly Daravuth, similarly commented in 2006 that his films lacked artistic qualities.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Rope</b> {{splicing}} in ropework is {{the forming}} of a semi-permanent joint between two <b>ropes</b> or {{two parts of}} the same <b>rope</b> by partly untwisting and then interweaving their strands. Splices can be used to form a stopper {{at the end of a}} line, to form a loop or an eye in a <b>rope,</b> or for joining two <b>ropes</b> together. Splices are preferred to knotted <b>rope,</b> since while a knot typically reduces the strength by 20-40%, a splice is capable of attaining a <b>rope's</b> full strength. However, splicing usually results in a thickening of the line and, if subsequently removed, leaves a distortion of the <b>rope.</b> Most types of splices are used on 3-strand <b>rope,</b> but some can be done on 12-strand or greater single-braided <b>rope,</b> as well as most double braids.While a spliced 3-strand <b>rope's</b> strands are interwoven to create the splice, a braided <b>rope's</b> splice is constructed by simply pulling the <b>rope</b> into its jacket.|$|R

25|$|Breakaway <b>roping</b> – {{an easier}} form of calf <b>roping</b> where {{a very short}} lariat is used, tied lightly to the saddle horn with string and a flag.

In the United States, this event is primarily for women of all ages and boys under 12, while in some nations where traditional calf <b>roping</b> is frowned upon, riders of both genders compete.|$|E

50|$|Single, double, and twin <b>rope</b> are {{the three}} main <b>rope</b> systems used in ice climbing.

Lastly, the twin <b>rope</b> system, which uses two twin <b>ropes</b> in a single <b>rope</b> system, is used for longer multi-pitch routes. Double and twin <b>rope</b> technique is used more frequently in ice climbing because these systems are more redundant, an important consideration given the number of sharp edges the ice climber carries with him.
