When Hitler became Chancellor in 1933, Rust was appointed as the Prussian Minister for Cultural Affairs. On 1 May 1934, he was selected as Minister of Science, Education and National Culture (Reichsminister für Wissenschaft, Erziehung und Volksbildung), and set about to reshape the German educational system to conform to his ideals of National Socialism. Considered by many to be mentally unstable, Rust would capriciously create new regulations and then repeal them just as quickly. One noted example was in 1935, when he changed the traditional six-day school week to five days, with Saturday to be [...] "Reich's Youth Day" [...] when children in the Hitler Youth and the League of German Girls would be out of school for study and testing. He then ordered the creation of a [...] "rolling week", with six days for study, followed by the [...] "youth day" [...] and a rest day, in 8-day periods. Thus, a <b>rolling</b> <b>week</b> starting on Monday would end with rest on the following Monday; the next <b>rolling</b> <b>week</b> would start on Tuesday and end 8 days later on the next Tuesday. When the 8-day week proved unworkable, Rust went back to the former system.|$|E

40|$|This report summarises the {{findings}} of an in situ seagrass shading study conducted in the Port of Gladstone {{from the beginning of}} April to the beginning of July 2012 during the seagrass senescent season. The study replicated senescent season shading studies originally conducted in 2010 in the Gladstone area focus sing on the impacts of prolonged shading on Zostera capricorni. The main objective {{of the study was to}} test conclusions from previous shading studies that seagrasses were not affected by a reduction in light during the senescent season. The key findings of this study are: • Seagrass meadows experiencing prolonged (> 9 weeks) shading in the 2012 senescent season had a small but significantly lower above- ground biomass of Z. capricorni compared with control plots. • Biomass was reduced relative to control plots for seagrasses under all shade intensities applied, most likely due to all shade treatments resulting in light levels below the minimum light requirement for Z. capricorni during the study. • The effect of prolonged shading during the senescent season was minimal compared with effects detected during in situ shading studies conducted over the seagrass growing season. • All levels of shading resulted in seagrasses receiving less than 6 mol quanta m⁻² d⁻¹ over a two <b>week</b> <b>rolling</b> average for the majority of the study, whereas controls received slightly more than 6 mol quanta m⁻² d⁻¹ over a two <b>week</b> <b>rolling</b> average for the duration of the study. • Despite receiving more than 6 mol quanta m⁻² d⁻¹ the control (unshaded) treatments declined significantly over the duration of the study, as expected during the senescent season. These findings reinforce the established minimum light requirements for Gladstone seagrasses, with negative impacts to seagrass biomass detected with light below 6 mol quanta m⁻² d⁻¹ over a two <b>week</b> <b>rolling</b> average. However unlike the growing season where impacts were noted between 3 and 4 weeks of light below the threshold, reductions were not detected until 9 weeks of constant shading. So while the results indicate some merit in using the established growing season light trigger during the senescent season, implementing the trigger as a management tool during this time of year may be problematic as: • The size of the effect was relatively small • Seagrasses are naturally declining during this period even when receiving light above the threshold • It required up to 9 weeks of shading below the light requirement to induce a measurable impac...|$|R
60|$|The {{two boys}} {{spent most of}} the {{following}} <b>week</b> <b>rolling</b> logs and they were busy among them one hot afternoon when Mr. Oliver walked out of the bush nearby. As they did not immediately see him, he stopped and stood watching them in the shadow for a few minutes. Frank was feeling more cheerful by this time, though his hands were still very sore and, as a good many of the logs were burned on the outside, he was more or less blackened all over. He was getting used to the work, and Jake, who had arrived with the sloop in the meanwhile, relieved him and his companion of the heaviest part of it. Turning around presently at a sound, Frank saw Mr. Oliver smiling at him.|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{long-term}} {{behavior of the}} stock market index of the New York Stock Exchange is studied, for the period 1950 to 2013. Specifically, the CRSP Value-Weighted and CRSP Equal-Weighted index are analyzed in terms of market efficiency, using the standard ratio variance test, considering over 1600 one <b>week</b> <b>rolling</b> windows. For the equally weighted index, the null hypothesis of random walk is rejected in the whole period, while for the weighted market value index, the null hypothesis start to be accepted from the 1990 s. In order to explain this difference, we raised the hypothesis that this behavior {{can be explained by the}} joint action of portfolios and non-synchronous trading effects. To check the feasibility of the above assumption, we performed a simulation of both effects, on two- and six-asset portfolios. The results showed that it is possible to explain the empirical difference between the two index, almost entirely by the joint effects of portfolio and non-synchronous trading.

40|$|This {{interim report}} {{provides}} {{an update on}} the Benthic Primary Producer Habitat Assessment and Seagrass Health Studies programs in Port Curtis and Rodds Bay from November 2009 to December 2010. It integrates the multi-faceted monitoring and research program formed from a collaboration between Fisheries Queensland, Vision Environment and Queensland Gas Corporation (QGC) in preparation {{for the development of a}} large scale dredging operation for a liquefied coal seam gas port facility on Curtis Island. Many components of this study are still underway and as such results for these are preliminary and are likely to be further refined at the conclusion of experimental work. Full results will be available as part of the final report at the conclusion of experimental studies. In order to develop effective predictive models of impact to seagrasses and appropriate dredge mitigation strategies to minimise the impacts, information on the distribution, light requirements, tolerances and ability to recover for the various seagrass communities in Gladstone is required. The major outcomes from the program (to date) developed to address these questions are outlined below: • Based on early results of the program a light requirement trigger for seagrasses in Port Curtis of 12 mol m⁻² d⁻¹ over a <b>rolling</b> two <b>week</b> period is suggested. This value could be used year round as a conservative approach to light requirements. • Results from winter experiments suggest light requirements at this time of year may be significantly lower. The light requirement trigger will be further refined with further results from experimental program underway. • Seagrass distribution and abundance was significantly lower during the winter re-survey of the Western Basin compared to the summer baseline in November 2009. This result is typical of the natural seasonal dynamics found in tropical Queensland seagrass meadows (Carruthers et al. 2002). • Seagrasses in Port Curtis appear to exist in a low light, nutrient rich and nitrogen limiting environment. Quarterly monitoring found seagrass meadow nutrient dynamics to also follow typical seasonal patterns corresponding to summer (wet) and winter (dry) shifts. • Reproductive potential and productivity (growth) rates measured over the previous 12 months provides a means to assess seagrass species' potential resilience to future 2 environmental and habitat change. Initial trends are limited, however, a larger dataset will provide more detailed information on Gladstone seagrass productivity over the next year. • Simulated light reduction during in situ shading experiments found a much smaller effect on all Gladstone seagrass species in the winter than during summer studies. • Pigment characterisation during shading studies found that the violaxanthin deepoxidation state may act as the best sub-lethal indicator tool out of those tested, however further analysis and testing during lab manipulation studies is needed to further develop and assess its applicability for dredge mitigation and management of seagrass. • Conclusions from the tidal exposure study are limited as only one sampling event had taken place at the time of production of this interim report (November 2010). From this study, however, seagrass appeared high-light adapted but with consistent declines in photosynthetic activity with air-exposure. This finding highlights the sensitivity of these intertidal species to desiccation which has major implications with respect to their daily productivity. • The initial spectral profiling of Gladstone Harbour during both pre-dredge and con-dock dredging detected a significant "yellow-shift" in the spectral quality of light at 2. 0 m. Lab manipulation experiments will provide a clearer understanding of what impact this shift has on seagrass physiology and associated light demands. The environmental requirements and impacts of potential light reductions from large scale dredging to Port Curtis seagrasses will be refined as background monitoring data and seagrass health studies are completed. A final report on the shading study results as well as ongoing seagrass health studies projects will be provided in July 2011. Other significant results that are completed prior to this time will be presented as they become available and as part of an interim update in March 2011...|$|R
40|$|Extract] The Port Curtis Western Basin Dredging and Disposal Project (WBDDP) was {{identified}} as posing {{a high level of}} environmental risk to marine habitats in the Gladstone area, particularly to seagrass meadows. The process of marine dredging elevates suspended solids within the water column, reducing light availability to marine habitats, and can result in high levels of stress and mortality to benthic primary producers such as seagrasses (Erftemeijer et al. 2006). Minimum light requirements (MLR) for seagrass differ among species and seasons, yet it is well established that changes in the availability of light remains the primary factor affecting seagrass distribution, abundance and productivity (Duarte et al. 1997; Vermaat et al. 1997; Hemminga & Duarte 2000; Erftemeijer et al. 2006; Ralph et al. 2007). Since 2009, James Cook University (JCU and previously the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, DAFF) and the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) have been actively undertaking seagrass research to assess seagrass health during the WBDDP. The primary aim of this research has been to address one of the Queensland Coordinator General's conditions on the project to develop a water quality monitoring program incorporating a) minimum light requirements of local seagrasses and b) the use of sub- lethal indicators of seagrass light stress to assess seagrass condition should seagrass light requirement triggers be exceeded. In May 2012, DAFF (now JCU) delivered a report that documented a light-based management approach to protect Gladstone seagrasses from dredging impacts associated with the WBDDP. Through a multifaceted research program spanning over two years, Chartrand et al. (2012) determined that Z. muelleri the dominant species in Gladstone harbour requires between 4. 5 and 12 mol quanta m ̄ 2 d ̄ 1 during the growing season over a minimum period of two weeks to survive. Trends in benthic irradiance and seagrass condition at permanent survey sites showed that, in general Z. muelleri consistently received greater than 6 mol m ̄ 2 d ̄ 1 over a two <b>week</b> <b>rolling</b> average at most locations in the harbour during the growing season (when seagrass remained stable or increased in abundance). This value was therefore trialled as a trigger for management actions as part of an adaptive light based approach to manage potential impacts on seagrasses during Western Basin developments. While we have empirically established that 6 moles of irradiance per day is required to maintain a seagrass meadow in Gladstone Harbour, {{we do not have the}} ability to accurately predict over what period of time this quantity of light energy is required. While photophysiological and stable isotope (13 C/ 15 N) studies showed promising results for detecting changes in the seagrass health when exposed to dredging events (Chartrand et al. 2012), these methods lacked the temporal resolution to function as a sub-lethal stress indicator. The current focus of research is on a genetic approach which looks at changes in expression level of genes that respond when light limitations cause a change in the overall health of the plant. The specific aim of this research is to develop a fast and accurate RT-qPCR-based seagrass health monitoring system to provide a sub-lethal indicator for stress linked to managing dredging impacts. This new biomarker can be assessed when light falls below the required value in a light-based approach to dredge management. Such a biomarker will allow for robust and defendable decisions to be made on the health of seagrass potentially impacted by dredging before mortality symptoms become apparent. This interim report outlines progress on the project to date. The report is divided into two sections to describe progress on a) the laboratory development program and b) the field/laboratory validation program...|$|R
