5|$|The concept {{underlying}} {{the method is}} based on the probability integral transform, in that a set of independent random samples derived from any <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> should on average be uniformly distributed with respect to the cumulative distribution function of the <b>random</b> <b>variable.</b> The MPS method chooses the parameter values that make the observed data as uniform as possible, according to a specific quantitative measure of uniformity.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} rank players, FIDE, ICCF, and {{national}} chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. Elo is a statistical {{system based on}} the assumption that the chess performance of each player in his or her games is a <b>random</b> <b>variable.</b> Arpad Elo thought of a player's true skill as the average of that player's performance <b>random</b> <b>variable,</b> and showed how to estimate the average from results of player's games. The US Chess Federation implemented Elo's suggestions in 1960, and the system quickly gained recognition as being both fairer and more accurate than older systems; it was adopted by FIDE in 1970. The highest FIDE rating of all time, 2881, was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.|$|E
5|$|Logarithms {{also occur}} in {{log-normal}} distributions. When the logarithm of a <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> has a normal distribution, the variable {{is said to}} have a log-normal distribution.

Thus, NA <b>random</b> <b>variables</b> are END.

5|$|A {{stochastic}} or {{random process}} {{can be defined as}} a collection of random variables that is indexed by some mathematical set, meaning that each <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> of the stochastic process is uniquely associated with an element in the set. The set used to index the random variables is called the index set. Historically, the index set was some subset of the real line, such as the natural numbers, giving the index set the interpretation of time. Each <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> in the collection takes values from the same mathematical space known as the state space. This state space can be, for example, the integers, the real line or -dimensional Euclidean space. An increment is the amount that a stochastic process changes between two index values, often interpreted as two points in time. A stochastic process can have many outcomes, due to its randomness, and a single outcome of a stochastic process is called, among other names, a sample function or realization.|$|E
25|$|In {{probability}} theory, {{a probability}} density function (PDF), or density of a continuous <b>random</b> <b>variable,</b> is a function, whose value {{at any given}} sample (or point) in the sample space (the set of possible values taken by the <b>random</b> <b>variable)</b> {{can be interpreted as}} providing a relative likelihood that the value of the <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> would equal that sample. In other words, while the absolute likelihood for a continuous <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> to take on any particular value is 0 (since there are an infinite set of possible values to begin with), the value of the PDF at two different samples can be used to infer, in any particular draw of the <b>random</b> <b>variable,</b> how much more likely it is that the <b>random</b> <b>variable</b> would equal one sample compared to the other sample.|$|E
