In the transient regime the total entropy of the system, which includes entropy flow and entropy generation, should be consid-ered (see Eq. (1) in the original paper).

40|$|Influence {{of surface}} {{roughness}} on the friction of TiC/a-C nanocomposite coatings while sliding against bearing steel balls in humid air was examined by detailed {{analyses of the}} wear surfaces and the wear scar on the ball counterparts by atomic force microscopy, optical, and confocal microscopy. It was observed that the surface roughness of the coatings essentially determines the wear behavior of the ball counterpart, which consequently influences the transfer film formation. A rough coating causes abrasive wear of the steel ball during the <b>running-in</b> <b>period,</b> which impedes {{the formation of a}} stable transfer film and leads to higher values of coefficient of friction (CoF). Moreover, the CoF does not show a decreasing trend after the <b>running-in</b> <b>period,</b> although the roughness of the coating was greatly reduced. Replacing the worn ball with a new one after the <b>running-in</b> <b>period</b> yields lower CoF values similar to that observed for a smooth coating. In both of the cases, no wear of the steel ball occurs and a stable transfer film forms and effectively covers the contact area. The influence of the wear debris on the formation of the transfer film is also discussed. ...|$|E

40|$|Posttraumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD), an anxiety disorder with lifetime prevalence of 7. 8 %, {{is characterized by}} symptoms that develop following exposure to traumatic life events and that cause an immediate experience of intense fear, helplessness or horror. PTSD is marked by recurrent nightmares typified by the recall of intrusive experiences and by extended disturbance throughout sleep. Individuals with PTSD respond poorly to drug treatments for insomnia. The disadvantages of drug treatment for insomnia underline the importance of non-pharmacological alternatives. Thus, the present study had three aims: first, to compare the efficiency of two relaxation techniques (muscular relaxation and progressive music relaxation) in alleviating insomnia among individuals with PTSD using both objective and subjective measures of sleep quality; second, to examine whether these two techniques have different effects on psychological indicators of PTSD, such as depression and anxiety; and finally, to examine how initial PTSD symptom severity and baseline emotional measures {{are related to the}} efficiency of these two relaxation methods.

40|$|The {{tribological}} {{properties of}} two steel surfaces rubbing {{against each other}} are measured while they are in contact with 1, 3 -diketones of varying structure. Such systems show after a short <b>running-in</b> <b>period</b> ultralow friction properties with a coefficient of friction of as low as µ = 0. 005. It is suggested that the extremely favorable friction properties are caused by a tribochemical reaction between the 1, 3 -diketones and the steel surfaces, leading to formation of a chelated iron-diketo complex. The influence of temperature and the molecular structure of the 1, 3 diketo-lubricants onto the friction properties {{of the system is}} elucidated under both static and dynamic conditions.
