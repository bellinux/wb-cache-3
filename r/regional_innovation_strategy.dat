40|$|Abstract: The <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> is {{recognised}} as {{a powerful}} driver of economic development at regional level. Over the years the methodology of developing the <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> has been broken down into three phases: 1) building up consensus, 2) analysing of the innovation potential in a region, and 3) defining priorities and action plan. The aim of the article is to present the <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> as a driver of economic development in a region, to explain the content {{and the process of}} forming the <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> and to give the view on practical approach to developing a <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> in the Banska Bystrica region. Attention will be given to building up the consensus in Banska Bystrica region, to the detailed analysis and evaluation of regional innovation potential as the outcomes for forming the <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> in Banska Bystrica region (stress is placed on a detailed analysis of economic potential and sector trends, on analysis of entrepreneurs needs, on analysis of technological offer and support to entrepreneurs and on analysis of the research and development state in a region of Banska Bystrica). Results of the analysis are of high importance and are viewed as the basic preconditions for the definition of main priorities for increasing innovation capacity in the Banska Bystrica region. For each of the stated priorities system measures of the strategy are described together with the set of proposed pilot activities. The paper was elaborated as a part of VEGA project 1 / 0654 / 11, “Innovative small and medium enterprises as a part of knowledge-based economy in Slovakia“...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{evaluate}} the support of <b>innovation</b> on the <b>regional</b> level and the regional levels in V 4 countries. We analyse <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategies</b> in these countries. The regional development strategies are relatively new phenomenon in V 4 countries. Most of the re- gions created their strategies less than five years ago and many of them have been still in imple- mentation phase, so we concentrate more on the creation of <b>innovation</b> <b>strategies</b> rather than on their implementation. The paper has two main parts - theoretical background containing the examples and reasons for innovation support at the regional level as well as key problems for governance of innovation support, mainly the problem of complexity of innovation support, which goes behind officially esta- blished borders. The second part compares activities and measures of 29 <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategies</b> in these regions and identifies some key differences among them. We found out more similarities among the regions from the same country rather than similarities among the regions with similar level of development (e. g. in metropolitan regions). We deal with some key issues for <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategies</b> – appropriate level and the role of regional self-governments for creation of strategy, se- ctoral dimension of RIS or “building cathedral in the desert” problem. We also identify dominance of hard infrastructure measures in the strategies. We also compare specific <b>innovation</b> <b>strategies</b> with general <b>regional</b> development strategies in order to identify key differences in governing crea- tion of these strategies. We suggested some improvement in the process of creation and implementation strategies. The concentration of priorities and resources is of crucial importance for success.

The opba can form molecular magnets, and the interactions of opba with SWCNTs can produce materials with very different magnetic/electronic properties. It is observed that the electronic interaction shows a dependence on the SWCNT diameter independent of whether they are metallic or semiconducting, although the interaction is stronger for metallic tubes. The interaction also {{is dependent on the}} amount of complex that is probably adsorbed on the carbon surface of the SWCNTs. Some charge transfer can be also occurring between the metallic complex and the SWCNTs. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|The data {{presented}} here were collected as {{one component of}} a project aimed at developing a <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> for the West Midlands region of England. Like most regional policy measures the <b>regional</b> <b>innovation</b> <b>strategy</b> programme was driven by concern over widening economic performance differences between (European) regions and {{was intended as a}} means of closing observed cohesion and technology gaps [Commission of the European Communities, 1998 Reinforcing Cohesion and Competitiveness Through Research, Technological Development and Innovation COM (98) 275]. More importantly, however, the notion that distinct regional innovation strategies may be developed in each assisted region is premised on a belief in underlying idiosyncrasies in regional resource endowments, competencies, institutional infrastructure, industry, and governance. In other words, it is premised on the belief that there exist, or may exist with sufficient encouragement or facilitation, distinct regional innovation systems within Europe (Thomas K, 2000 Regional Studies 34 190 - 198). Accordingly, my purpose in the current paper is to outline the basic precepts underpinning a systemic approach to innovation, generally, and a regional systemic approach, specifically. Thereafter, an attempt is made to map partially the existence, or indeed absence, of a West Midlands regional innovation system, proxied by available firm-level data, and to comment on the appropriateness of regional systems of innovation as units of analyses. ...|$|E
