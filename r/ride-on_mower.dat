50|$|Riding mowers (U.S. and Canada) or ride-on mowers (U.K. and Canada) are {{a popular}} {{alternative}} for large lawns. The operator {{is provided with}} a seat and controls on the mower and literally rides on the machine. Most use the horizontal rotating blade system, though usually with multiple blades. A common form of <b>ride-on</b> <b>mower</b> is the lawn tractor. These are usually designed to resemble a small agricultural tractor, with the cutting deck mounted amidships between {{the front and rear}} axles.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, newer cemeteries might be {{designed}} to be more efficiently maintained with lower labour through {{the increased use of}} equipment, e.g. lawn cemeteries where the maintenance can be performed with a <b>ride-on</b> <b>mower</b> or lawn tractor. However, efficient maintenance of newer graves is often frustrated by the actions of mourners who often place flowers and other objects on graves. These objects often require manual intervention; in some cases objects will be picked up and returned after maintenance, in other cases (e.g. dead flowers) they will be disposed of.|$|E
40|$|Lawnmower related {{injuries}} cause significant morbidity {{in children}} and young teenagers. The 'ride-on' mowers which are {{more powerful than the}} 'walk behind' mowers are becoming increasingly popular. The incidence and severity of injuries from either type of lawnmower appears to be steadily rising as is the burden placed on local plastic surgical and emergency services in managing the care of these patients. The aims of the study were to demonstrate changing trends in lawnmower-related injuries to children presenting to a single unit over a ten-year period and to identify any association between injury severity and machine subtype ('ride-on' versus 'walk-behind'). Hospital databases, theatre records and medical case notes were reviewed retrospectively of all patients under the age of 16 treated for lawnmower related injuries over a 10 year period from July 1998 to June 2008. Data gathered included patient demographics, injury site and severity, management (type and number of surgical procedures), length of hospital stay and outcome. Injury severity score was also calculated for each case. Controlling for estimated regional population changes, there was {{a significant increase in the}} number of <b>ride-on</b> <b>mower</b> related accidents in the time period 2003 - 2008, compared to the time period 1998 - 2003. Ride-on injuries had significantly higher injury severity scores, longer hospital stays and were more likely to involve amputations as compared with walk-behind injuries. Children can sustain significant injuries with unsafe lawnmower use. The current study demonstrates the increasing incidence of <b>ride-on</b> <b>mower</b> related injuries {{in children and}} identifies a greater morbidity associated with such injuries. Such presentations place intense demands on local plastic surgical services...|$|E

5000|$|Mower {{manufacturers}} {{market their}} mowers as side discharge, 2-in-1, meaning bagging and mulching or side discharging and mulching, and 3-in-1, meaning bagging, mulching, and side discharge. Most 2-in-1 bagging and mulching mowers require a separate attachment to discharge grass onto the lawn. Some side discharge mower manufacturers also sell separate [...] "mulching plates" [...] that {{will cover the}} opening on the side discharge mower and, {{in combination with the}} proper blades, will convert the mower to a mulching mower. These conversions are impractical when compared with 2- or 3-in-1 mowers which can be converted in the field in seconds. There are two types of bagging mowers. A rear bag mower features an opening {{on the back of the}} mower through which the grass is expelled into the bag. Hi-vac mowers have a tunnel that extends from the side discharge to the bag. Hi-vac is also the type of grass collection used on some riding lawn mowers and lawn tractors and is suitable for use in dry conditions but less suitable for long wet lush grass as they often clog up. Mulching and bagging mowers are not well suited to long grass or thick weeds. In some <b>ride-on</b> <b>mowers,</b> the cut grass is dropped onto the ground and then collected by a set of rotating bristles, allowing even long, wet grass to be collected.|$|R
50|$|Typically, lawn cemeteries {{comprise}} {{a number of}} graves in this lawn setting with trees and gardens on the perimeter. Adolph Strauch introduced this style in 1855 in Cincinnati.While aesthetic appeal to family members has been the primary driver {{for the development of}} lawn cemeteries, cemetery authorities initially welcomed this new style of cemetery enthusiastically, expecting easier maintenance. Selecting (or grading) the land intended for a lawn cemetery so that it is completely flat allows the use of large efficient <b>mowers</b> (such as <b>ride-on</b> <b>mowers</b> or lawn tractors) - the plaques (being horizontally set in the ground) lie below the level of the blades and are not damaged by the blades. Unfortunately, in practice, while families are often initially attracted to the uncluttered appearance of a lawn cemetery, the common practice of placing flowers (sometimes in vases) and increasingly other items (e.g. small toys on children's graves) re-introduces some clutter to the cemetery and makes it difficult to use the larger mowers. While cemetery authorities increasingly impose restrictions on the nature and type of objects that can be placed on lawn graves and actively remove prohibited items, grieving families are often unwilling to comply with these restrictions and become very upset if the items are removed. Another problem with lawn cemeteries involves grass over-growth over time: the grass can grow over and cover the plaque, to the distress of families who can no longer easily locate the grave. Grasses that propagate by an above-ground stolon (runner) can cover a plaque very quickly. Grasses that propagate by a below-ground rhizome tend not to cover the plaque as easily.|$|R

5000|$|A monumental {{cemetery}} is {{the traditional}} style of cemetery where headstones or other monuments made of marble, granite or similar materials rise vertically above the ground (typically around 50 cm but some can be over 2 metres high). Often the entire grave is covered by a slab, commonly concrete, {{but it can be}} more expensive materials such as marble or granite, and/or has its boundaries delimited by a fence which may be made of concrete, cast iron or timber. Where a number of family members are buried together (either vertically or horizontally), the slab or boundaries may encompass a number of graves. Monumental cemeteries are often regarded as unsightly due to the random collection of monuments and headstones they contain. Also, as maintenance of the headstones is the responsibility of family members (in the absence of a proscribed Perpetual Care and Maintenance Fund), over time many headstones are forgotten about and decay and become damaged. For cemetery authorities, monumental cemeteries are difficult to maintain. While cemeteries often have grassed areas between graves, the layout of graves makes it difficult to use modern equipment such as <b>ride-on</b> lawn <b>mowers</b> in the cemetery. Often the maintenance of grass must be done by more labour-intensive (and therefore expensive) methods. In order to reduce the labour cost, devices such as string trimmers are increasingly used in cemetery maintenance, but such devices can damage the monuments and headstones. Cemetery authorities dislike the criticism they receive for the deteriorating condition of the headstones, arguing that they have no responsibility for the upkeep of headstones, and typically disregard their own maintenance practices as being one of the causes of that deterioration.|$|R

We exemplify visualization in requirements assessment for an automotive interior cockpit unit and for the layout of a <b>ride-on</b> lawn <b>mower.</b> Visualized structure and behavior are then related to the product model and so-called organ units. We choose {{to make use of}} open-source VR - Open Scene Graph - that has optimum real-time performance, up-to-date rendering, and work on simple workstations. One example is the visualization of issues which influence seating height. The optimum seat position and preferred height above the engine are critical dimensions in this case, shown in Figure 2. It is therefore important to show how these should be varied in direction and amount as done here. The "optimum seat position" requirement is then related to the ergonomic function "Support pelvis" while the "preferred height" requirement is an iib relation from the engine to the "Support pelvis" function. Another example treats requirements on a passive knee absorber. It is important in this case to show the areas covered by active and passive protection and the interval of initial knee speed. We suggest here colored fields which show likelihood of impact position of the knees for a certain body size, so that the structure stiffness can be optimized and any conflicts with other functionality such as storage can be characterized. The current ambition of the research work as a whole is to cover several areas for visual spatial representation of a product model as suggested in this paper. The case studies in this paper have exemplified some of these areas: Design intention and constraints.

40|$|Roll-Over Protective Structure (ROPS) {{represents}} {{the state of}} art for the driver’s protection in case of tractors roll-over. Despite their real risk of overturning, the ROPS approach for the Self-Propelled agricultural Machinery (SPM) is quite recent. Due to the several SPM categories available on the market, characterized by very different mass, dimension and working functions, the fitting of a ROPS and consequently the ascertainment of its protection level is quite complicated. SPM could be preliminarily divided into at least two categories: - large SPM: combine, forage, potato, sugar-beet and grape harvesters; sprayer; etc.; - small SPM: <b>ride-on</b> tractor, <b>mower,</b> comb side-delivery rake, etc. The most followed approach at present is to check preliminarily the overturning behavior of the SPM considering its longitudinal and lateral stability; if a real risk of overturning is ascertained, {{in order to minimize}} the likelihood of driver’s injury the manufacturer often installs a ROPS. The consequent need is to provide some test criteria of them. Sprayers between large SPM, and comb side-delivery rake between small SPM were the machine types on which ROPS were tested, adopting in both cases the procedure provided by Code 4 issued by the Organization for Economic and Cooperation Development (OECD), dedicated to ROPS fitted on conventional agricultural and forestry tractors. Notwithstanding the very different dimensions of these two SPM, this standard was selected considering the predictable roll-over behavior, also in relation with the front and rear track values. On the 4950 kg mass sprayer was fitted a closed cab, while on the 690 kg mass comb side-delivery rakes a 3 -pillars frame was applied. In both cases the response of the tests was positive, so indicating a general suitability of OECD Code 4 to assure a ROPS good driver’s protection level in case of overturning. On the other hand, to ascertain more in detail the roll-over behavior of the SPM, some further questions need to be deeply examined, such as the driver’s place location, the height of the centre of gravity from the ground in different machine configurations (i. e. with crop tanks empty or full), the external silhouette, the axles mass distribution of the laden/unladen machine, etc...|$|R
