5000|$|The Series 62 {{included}} a lower sleeker body, a new cellular grille insert, and inverted gull wing front bumpers and tapered dagmar style bumper guards. Round jet style dual exhaust outlets {{were incorporated into}} the vertical bumper extensions and the rear bumper was entirely redesigned. An Eldorado style wraparound windshield was seen on all models. Sedans used a distinctive style of window <b>reveal</b> <b>molding,</b> which created a built in sun visor effect. For coupes a smoothly curved wraparound backlight {{was referred to as}} the [...] "Florentine" [...] style rear window. A wide ventilator intake was now stretched across the base of the windshield on all body styles and the chrome visored headlamp look was emphasized. The Series 62 could be distinguished by the lack of rear fender louvers. V-shaped ornaments and crests were used in the hood and deck and there were full length body underscores in bright metal. Coupe de Ville script was seen on rear corner pillars of the luxury hardtop, which also had wider sill moldings. The Eldorados had golden identifying crests centered directly behind the air-slot fender breaks and wide fluted beauty panels to decorate the lower rear body sides. These panels were made of extruded aluminum and also appeared on a unique one of a kind Eldorado coupe built for the Reynolds Aluminum Corporation. Also included in the production Eldorado convertible were monogram plates on the doors, wire wheels, and custom interior trimmings with the Cadillac crest embossed on the seat bolsters. Automatic windshield washers, power steering, 12-Volt electrical system, and aluminum alloy pistons made the long list of standard equipment {{for the first time this}} year. Power steering, windows, seats, and auto headlight dimming were optional. [...] A parking brake release reminder light was new. Popular Mechanics rated to 0-60 mph time as 17.3 seconds.|$|E
40|$|Liquefied {{petroleum}} gas (LPG) and {{compressed natural gas}} (CNG) are currently the leading fuel contenders for converting vehicles from gasoline and diesel to alternative fuels. Two factors that inhibit conversion are additional vehicle costs and reduced range compared to gasoline. In overcoming these barriers, {{a key element of}} the alternative fuel system becomes the storage tank for these pressurized fuels. Using cylindrical pressure vessels is the conventional approach, but they do not package well in the available vehicle volume. Thiokol Corporation has developed and is now producing a conformable (non-cylindrical) aluminum storage system for LPG vans. This system increases fuel storage in a given rectangular envelope. The goal of this project was to develop the technology for a lower cost conformable tank made of injection-molded plastic. Much {{of the cost of the}} aluminum conformable tank is in the fabrication because several weld seams are required. The injection-molding process has the potential to greatly reduce the fabrication costs. The requirements of a pressurized fuel tank on a vehicle necessitate the proper combination of material properties. Material selection and tank design must be optimized for maximum internal volume and minimum material use to be competitive with other technologies. The material and the design must also facilitate the injection-molding process. Prototype tanks must be fabricated to <b>reveal</b> <b>molding</b> problems, prove solutions, and measure results. In production, efficient fabrication will be key to making these tanks cost competitive. The work accomplished during this project has demonstrated that conformable LPG tanks can be molded with thermoplastics. However, to achieve a competitive tank, improvements are needed in the effective material strength. If these improvements can be made, molded plastics should produce a lower cost tank that can store more LPG on a vehicle than conventional cylinders...|$|E

40|$|Aspergillus endophthalmitis is {{a devastating}} {{inflammatory}} {{condition of the}} intraocular cavities that may result in irreparable loss of vision and rapid destruction of the eye. Almost all cases in the literature have shown an identified source causing aspergillus endophthalmitis {{as a result of}} direct extension of disease. We present a rare case of bilateral aspergillus endophthalmitis. A 72 -year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus, congenital Hirschsprung disease, and recent culture-positive candida pyelonephritis with hydronephrosis status post-surgical stent placement presented with difficulty opening her eyes. She complained of decreased vision (20 / 200) with pain and redness in both eyes – right worse then left. Examination demonstrated multiple white fungal balls in both retinas consistent with bilateral fungal endophthalmitis. Bilateral vitreous taps for cultures and staining were performed. Patient was given intravitreal injections of amphotericin B, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and started on oral fluconazole. Patient was scheduled for vitrectomy to decrease organism burden and to remove loculated areas of infection that would not respond to systemic antifungal agents. Four weeks after initial presentation, the fungal cultures <b>revealed</b> <b>mold</b> growth consistent with aspergillus. Patient was subsequently started on voriconazole and fluconazole was discontinued due to poor efficacy against aspergillus. Further workup was conducted to evaluate for the source of infection and seeding. Transthoracic cardiogram was unremarkable for any vegetation or valvular abnormalities. MRI of the orbits and sinuses did not reveal any mass lesions or bony destruction. CT of the chest was unremarkable for infection. Aspergillus endophthalmitis may occur because of one of these several mechanisms: hematogenous dissemination, direct inoculation by trauma, and contamination during surgery.

40|$|Hypersensitivity {{pneumonitis}} (HP) is an immune-mediated {{hypersensitivity reaction}} {{to a variety of}} inhaled particles that may lead to acute, subacute, or chronic interstitial pneumonitis and possibly end-stage lung disease. Avian antigens most commonly cause HP in children, but fungi have also been implicated. Objective: To describe a 15 -year-old girl and her 6 -year-old brother who developed HP from residential exposure to Aureobasidium pullulans. Methods: Allergy skin testing, serum precipitating antibodies, pulmonary function testing, chest radiography, chest computed tomography, bronchoalveolar lavage, and a home survey for possible causative antigens were performed. Results: Both patients lived on a horse farm and had fatigue, weight loss, cough, and dyspnea. The siblings had restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with decreased diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide, ground-glass opacities on high-resolution chest computed tomography, and serum precipitins to A pullulans. Bronchoalveolar lavage in the girl demonstrated lymphocytosis, with a preponderance of CD 8 + T cells and natural killer cells. Symptoms improved after the children vacated the home and recurred on repeated exposure in both patients. Home evaluation <b>revealed</b> extensive <b>mold</b> contamination, with A pullulans counts of 659, 329, and 71 CFU/m 3 in the boy's bedroom, the girl's bedroom, and outdoors, respectively.

The main {{purpose of the current}} study was, therefore, to assess the microbiological safety of sponges as it has been used in selected food establishments of Jimma town. Accordingly, the microbiological safety of a total of 201 kitchen sponges randomly collected from food establishments was evaluated against the total counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB), Enterobacteriaceae, coliforms, and yeast and molds. The mean counts of aerobic mesophilic bacteria ranged from 7. 43 to 12. 44 [*]log[*]CFU/mm 3.

40|$|A molded film of single-component polymer-grafted {{nanoparticles}} (SPNP), {{consisting of}} a spherical silica core and densely grafted polymer chains bearing hydrogen-bonding side groups capable of physical crosslinking, was investigated by in situ ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) measurement during a uniaxial stretching process. Static USAXS <b>revealed</b> that the <b>molded</b> SPNP formed a highly oriented twinned face-centered cubic (f. c. c.) lattice structure with the [11 − 1] plane aligned nearly parallel to the film surface in the initial state. Structural analysis of in situ USAXS using a model of uniaxial deformation induced by rearrangement of the nanoparticles revealed that the f. c. c. lattice was distorted in the stretching direction {{in proportion to the}} macroscopic strain until the strain reached 35 %, and subsequently changed into other f. c. c. lattices with different orientations. The lattice distortion and structural transition behavior corresponded well to the elastic and plastic deformation regimes, respectively, observed in the stress–strain curve. The attractive interaction of the hydrogen bond is considered to form only at the top surface of the shell and then plays an effective role in cross-linking between nanoparticles. The rearrangement mechanism of the nanoparticles is well accounted for by a strong repulsive interaction between the densely grafted polymer shells of neighboring particles...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the mechanical properties of green composites made from lignin and cellulose extracted from bamboo. The raw material, consisting of bamboo powder and pure water were put into the reactor and sealed tightly. To decompose the raw material, the temperature of reactor was elevated by the ring furnace to a specified level and maintained for 10 min. For investigate the ability of the decomposed bamboo powder to be molded without the use of a binder, the compression molding technique was employed. The mechanical characteristics of fabricated composites were measured under four point bending load. The Young’s modulus of fabricated composites was also measured by using dynamic hardness tester. The change in amount of holocellulose, α-cellulose, and lignin during molding was quantitatively evaluated by using the milled composite. Test results showed that the bending strength was increased with increase of temperature of molding. Fracture surface observation <b>revealed</b> that when <b>molding</b> temperature was high, fine surface was appeared at fractured surface, while rough surface was appeared when molding temperature was low. These results suggested that the thermoset ability of lignin was enhanced when molding temperature was high. By enhancing the thermoset ability of lignin, bending characteristics of composites was improved. Quantitative determination results showed that when molding temperature was higher than decomposed temperature of bamboo powder, the change in composition was appeared. Therefore, excessively high molding temperature is not effective because of the α-cellulose might be decompose...|$|R
40|$|Metal {{injection}} molding (MIM) has acquired increasing importance as a production technique for small, complex stainless steel components [1, 2]. Sintering {{is critical for}} determining the final quality of the parts produced by MIM. Because high sintered density is imperative for good mechanical properties and corrosion resistance, achieving full or near-full density {{has been a major}} objective of sintering [3]. Therefore, most research on 316 L stainless steel sintering to date has focused on the sintering behavior of the molded parts especially for gas-atomised powder in argon environment [3 - 6]. An understanding of the factors influencing densification of stainless steels is important as over 50 % of the injection molded and sintered components are made from stainless steel compositions [7]. In a metal {{injection molding}} (MIM) process, gas-atomised powder is generally used due to their high packing density and associated feedstock rheology. The sintered components exhibit mechanical and corrosion properties similar or superior to that of wrought material. Water-atomised powders in MIM can be economical and have an improvement in shape retention during debinding and sintering. However, their use comes with a penalty of lower powder loading and sintered density, with a corresponding degradation in the mechanical and corrosion properties. Studies <b>reveal</b> that injection <b>molded</b> and sintered components using water-atomised 316 L stainless steel powders have a residual porosity of 3 – 5 % for similar particle characteristics and sintering conditions as that of gas-atomised powders [5].

40|$|Leber's {{hereditary}} {{optic neuropathy}} (LHON) is a maternally inherited form of retinal ganglion cell degeneration leading to optic atrophy in young adults. Several mutations in different genes can cause LHON (heterogeneity). The ND 6 gene {{is one of}} the mitochondrial genes that encodes subunit 6 of complex I of the respiratory chain. This gene is a hot spot gene. Fourteen Persian LHON patients were analyzed with single-strand conformational polymorphism and DNA sequencing techniques. None of these patients had four primary mutations, G 3460 A, G 11788 A, T 14484 C, and G 14459 A, related to this disease. We identified twelve nucleotide substitutions, G 13702 C, T 13879 C, T 14110 C, C 14167 T, G 14199 T, A 14233 G, G 14272 C, A 14290 G, G 14365 C, G 14368 C, T 14766 C, and T 14798 C. Eleven of twelve nucleotide substitutions had already been reported as polymorphism. One of the nucleotide substitutions (A 14290 G) has not been reported. The A 14290 G nucleotide substitution does not change its amino acid (glutamic acid). We looked for base conservation using DNA star software (MEGALIGN program) as a criterion for pathogenic or nonpathogenic nucleotide substitution in A 14290 G. The results of ND 6 gene alignment in humans and in other species (mouse, cow, elegans worm, and Neurospora crassa <b>mold)</b> <b>revealed</b> that the 14290 th base was not conserved.

The isolates were identified to species levels by sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions using primers ITS 1 and ITS 4. None of the 28 genetically well characterized isolates of P. marneffei were identified as P. marneffei by MALDI-TOF MS, because P. marneffei was not present in either Bruker general library (DB 5627) or Bruker filamentous fungi library V 1. 0. However, the rate of accurate identification as P. marneffei (score value  2. 000) was 85. 7 % based on newly-created database from one P. marneffei strain (NTUH- 3370) by MALDI Biotyper system. Sequencing analysis of these 22 non-P. marneffei isolates of <b>molds</b> <b>revealed</b> seven Paecilomyces variotii, six Fusarium solani, four Paecilomyces lilacinus, and one each of Paecilomyces sinensis, Rhizopus arrhizus, Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizopus microspores, and P. boydii.

The aim of this Bachelor thesis was {{to confirm that the}} air quality in the food plant is better than in the current environment. Microbial cleanliness should be at the highest level, especially in places where is risk of contamination of the products. Air composition was observed in microbrewery by Czech University of Life Sciences Prague. It was evaluated {{by the total number of}} microorganisms and number of moulds. In the case of moulds there was also determined gender representation. Samples of air with present microorganisms were collected from five parts of the brewery, using active air intake with airsampler MAS 100 Eco (Merck, Germany). It was a sanitation station, lager beer cellar, section wort cooling, boiling room and to compare the hall. Air analysis was performed twice with intervals of two months. According to the findings, in sanitation station can be found higher total number of microorganisms than in the hall. However, this increased incidence could be related to microbial penetration from the outside environment due to the use of makeshift door leading into the room. In other parts of the operation has already been confirmed less than the total number of microorganisms in the hall. Enumeration of <b>molds</b> <b>revealed</b> that the entire operation were lower than the concentrations of these microbes in the corridor. Dangerous place in the brewery in terms of contamination of the product is lager cellar, because here with maturation occurs also his tapping. Here upheld a lower incidence of microorganisms than in the current environment, and as other parts of the plant do not pose a risk of product degradation, the objective has been achieved. Of the native representation of mould in the air microbrewery it shows that the most abundant mould genus was Cladosporium and Penicillium followed.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{maximize}} production rate, {{an increasing number}} of electronic packages are manufactured in a package array mold, such as Small Outline Transistor (SOT) package. Due to the complicated structure design of the package and mold cavity, wire sweep is becoming a severe problem. In the study, the numerical model was firstly validated by experimental work using short shots experiment and X-ray technology. Then the verified model was employed for flow pattern and wire sweep analysis. The leadframe detail structure effects were evaluated at first. The effects of leadframe detail structure on flow pattern and wire sweep are insignificant and may be ignored, most likely due to the thin thickness of leadframe and the relatively lower position to the bond wire loop. Besides, for fixed width and length of the die, the wire sweep behavior was predicted by simulation to estimate the influence of the die height (thickness). The results show that the thinner the die, the smaller the wire sweep. Furthermore, the effect of cavity height on wire sweep value was also evaluated. Then, the ratio of the die height to that of the cavity was introduced as an index to investigate the main factors which influence the wire sweep values and propose a guideline for package and cavity design to reduce the wire sweep. It can be further concluded that velocity is more sensitive to the change of the package and cavity structures, compared with the viscosity. Next, a new design of industry package array mold was introduced for wire sweep study with the practical transfer molding process conditions. It shows the sharply increased velocity is the essential reason for the wire sweep issue at the vent side of the mold, due to the unbalanced flow of EMC. In order to address the issue, the transfer mold process optimization with transfer profile was carried out.

40|$|Accurate {{modeling}} {{of the metal}} casting process prior to creating a mold design demands reliable knowledge of the interfacial heat transfer coefficient at the mold metal interface {{as a function of}} both time and location. The phenomena concerned with the gap forming between the mold and the solidifying metal are complex but need to be understood before any modeling is attempted. The presence of mold coatings further complicates the situation. A commercial casting was chosen and studied in a gravity permanent mold casting process. The metal/mold interfacial heat transfer coefficient (IHTC) was the focus of the research. A simple, direct method has been used to evaluate the IHTC. Both the simulation and experiments have shown that a reasonably good estimate of the heat transfer coefficient could be made in the case studied. It has been found that there is a good agreement between experiments and simulations in the temperature profiles during the solidification process, given that the primary mechanism of heat transfer across the gap in permanent mold casting of light alloys is by conduction across the gap. The procedure utilized to determine the interfacial heat transfer coefficient can be applied to other casting processes. A recently completed project involving The University of Michigan and Mississippi State University, together with several industrial partners, which was supported by the USDOE through the Cast Metals Coalition, examined a number of cases of thermal contact. In an investigation which gave special consideration to the techniques of measurement, several mold coatings were employed and results presented as a function of time. Realistic conditions of coating thickness and type together with an appropriate combination of mold preheat and metal pouring temperature were strictly maintained throughout the investigation. Temperature sensors, in particular thermocouples, play an important part in validating the predictions of solidification models. Cooling curve information, as well as temperature gradient history both in the solidifying metal and within the mold are invariably required to be validated. This validation depends upon the response of the sensor concerned, but also on its own effect upon the thermal environment. A joint university/industry team has completed an investigation of the invasive effects of thermocouples upon temperature history in permanent molds determining the degree of uncertainty associated with placement and indicating how the time-temperature history may be recovered. In addition to its relevance to the all important study of thermal contact of the casting with metallic molds, the observations also impact the determination of heat flux and interfacial heat transfer coefficients. In these respects the study represents {{the first of its kind}} that has tackled the problem in depth for permanent mold castings. An important ramification of this investigation has been the errors likely to be encountered in mold temperature measurement with thin section aluminum castings, especially with respect to the plans for thermocouple placement. A comparison between the degree of uncertainty experienced in sand molds compared with that found in permanent <b>molds</b> <b>reveals</b> that the associated problems have a lesser impact. These conclusions and the related recommendations have been disseminated to industry and the technical community through project reports and publications...|$|R
