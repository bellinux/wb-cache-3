60|$|Uncomfortable as the night, {{with its}} <b>rocking</b> <b>movement,</b> and salt smells, may have been, {{and in one}} case {{undoubtedly}} was, for Mr. Pepper had insufficient clothes upon his bed, the breakfast next morning wore a kind of beauty. The voyage had begun, and had begun happily with a soft blue sky, and a calm sea. The sense of untapped resources, things to say as yet unsaid, made the hour significant, so that in future years the entire journey perhaps would be represented by this one scene, {{with the sound of}} sirens hooting in the river the night before, somehow mixing in.|$|E
60|$|In I got bodily {{into the}} apple barrel, and found there was scarce an apple left; but sitting {{down there in}} the dark, what with the sound of the waters and the <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> of the ship, I had either fallen asleep or was on the point of doing so when a heavy man sat down with rather a clash close by. The barrel shook as he leaned his {{shoulders}} against it, and I was just about to jump up when the man began to speak. It was Silver's voice, and before I had heard a dozen words, I would not have shown myself for all the world, but lay there, trembling and listening, in the extreme of fear and curiosity, for from these dozen words I understood that the lives of all the honest men aboard depended upon me alone.|$|E

Completely unnerved, I leaped to my feet; but the measured <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> of Usher was undisturbed. I rushed to the chair in which he sat. His eyes were bent fixedly before him, and throughout his whole countenance there reigned a stony rigidity. But, as I placed my hand upon his shoulder, there came a strong shudder over his whole person; a sickly smile quivered about his lips; and I saw that {{he spoke in a}} low, hurried, and gibbering murmur, as if unconscious of my presence. Bending closely over him, I at length drank in the hideous import of his words.|$|E

60|$|Anyone who {{had stood}} by now would have pitied her, {{not so much}} on account of her {{exposure}} to weather, and isolation from all of humanity except the mouldered remains inside the tumulus; but for that other form of misery which was denoted by the slightly <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> that her feelings imparted to her person. Extreme unhappiness weighed visibly upon her. Between the drippings of the rain from her umbrella to her mantle, from her mantle to the heather, from the heather to the earth, very similar sounds could be heard coming from her lips; and the tearfulness of the outer scene was repeated upon her face. The wings of her soul were broken by the cruel obstructiveness of all about her; and even had she seen herself in a promising way of getting to Budmouth, entering a steamer, and sailing to some opposite port, she would have been but little more buoyant, so fearfully malignant were other things. She uttered words aloud. When a woman in such a situation, neither old, deaf, crazed, nor whimsical, takes upon herself to sob and soliloquize aloud there is something grievous the matter.|$|E

The winning entry, by John Godwin of Surrey, was: Break and remove two large side windows just aft of the pivot point and let the glass fall outside to lose its weight; break two windows over the two front axles, keeping the broken glass on board to keep its weight for balance; let a man out on a rope through the front broken windows (not to rest his weight on the ground) who deflates all the bus's front tires, to reduce the bus's <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> about its pivot point; drain the fuel tank, which is aft of the pivot point, which changes the balance enough to let a man get out and gather heavy rocks to load the front of the bus. Unload the bus. Wait until a suitable vehicle passes on the road, hijack it, and carry the gold away in it.|$|E

30|$|Mixing in {{traditional}} algae culture system consumes intensive electricity.

30|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a {{horizontal}} PBR system mixed with <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> driven by nature force, and these preliminary results showed the feasibility of it. Plastic bag {{can be used as}} horizontal PBR for this system, and culture depth no more than 10 ¬†cm will not face high water pressure problems as experienced in vertical PBRs. Plastic bag PBR has the advantage of low cost, and it can be simply disposed when facing fouling problem. The shape of plastic bag horizontal PBR culture system developed in this study is similar to closed pond. However, it is difficult to construct a pond with culture depth of only 10 ¬†cm or less, {{and it is difficult to}} use paddle wheel to drive the mixing in such shallow water. Instead, mixing in horizontal PBR can be driven by <b>rocking</b> <b>movement,</b> and much less culture depth can be used. This short light path resulted in much higher biomass concentration than closed pond, as shown in this study.|$|E

30|$|This study tested {{horizontal}} PBR at {{the scale}} of 1 ¬†m 2, and its scaling-up requires rocking platform with much larger size. A possible solution is to make rocking platform {{with the size of}} raceway pond, which is usually several meters in width and several tens of meters in length. This would result in rocking platform at the size of several hundred square meters. Driving <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> of this large-scale platform would not be a big problem, since falling water can provide intensive mechanical power and was used to drive heavy machines before electricity is popularized. Using hundreds of these rocking platforms would realize massive cultures at {{the scale of}} hectors. Construction of rocking platforms at this scale may be costly, but it would not be greater than horizontal tubular or vertical flat plate PBR systems at the same scale, in authors‚Äô opinion. If hydraulic power is used to drive this system, the cultivation field should be built at the site with plenty of water resources. Also, this horizontal PBR can be placed on water surface of ocean, river, or lake, driving <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> with wave, which is actually an ongoing research conducted by the authors. In addition, its <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> may be driven with many other nature forces, such as tide or wind, {{as long as they can}} provide mechanical power to drive a back/forth movement. There were actually many mature technologies to realize this before electricity power is popularized. Using nature force to drive the mixing would significantly improve energy balance for algal biomass production, which is a great hurdle in the commercialization of algal biofuel.|$|E
30|$|Mixing {{driven by}} <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> of {{horizontal}} PBR {{is quite different}} from traditional way such as paddle wheel or circulation pump. Rocking cycle should be a decisive factor to mixing. Thus, the effect of rocking cycle to biomass production and DO accumulation was investigated with small-scale horizontal PBRs at different light intensities. Culture depth of 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10.0 ¬†cm were used in these experiments since it provides light path at the same level as traditional PBRs.|$|E
30|$|Although high biomass {{concentration}} was obtained in culture of oxygen-tolerant Euhalothece sp., {{it is actually}} not practical to culture oxygen-sensitive algal strains if mixing is not sufficient. Thus, the capability of oxygen mass transfer in horizontal PBR should be improved in future study. This may be realized by optimizing the angle and cycle of horizontal PBR‚Äôs <b>rocking</b> <b>movement.</b> Also, the length of PBR would be a significant factor to mixing condition, since it can significantly change the flow field. In addition, baffles in horizontal PBR or open pond can change vertical flow, which was reported to improve mass transfer and frequency of light/dark cycle, and resulted in significant higher {{biomass concentration}} than its control (Zhang et al. 2015). Thus, mixing and mass transfer in horizontal PBR driven by <b>rocking</b> <b>movement</b> deserve intensive study in future. An interesting phenomenon observed {{in this study is}} that there was great difference between DO at the culture surface and bottom when culture depth was 7.5 ¬†cm or greater. This may also occur in open pond system, and special attention should be paid to this issue in study on mixing in horizontal PBR, as well as its design and operation.|$|E

40|$|The {{engraved}} {{trails of}} rocks on the nearly flat, dry mud surface of Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park, have excited {{speculation about the}} movement mechanism since the 1940 s. <b>Rock</b> <b>movement</b> has been variously attributed to high winds, liquid water, ice, or ice flotation, but has not been previously observed in action.
