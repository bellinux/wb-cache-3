40|$|Objective: to {{identify}} possible {{mechanisms by which}} caseload midwifery reduces preterm birth for young childbearing women. Design: a mixed methods triangulation, convergence design was used to answer the research question ‘How does the way maternity care is provided affect {{the health and well-being}} of young women and their babies?’ The project generated quantitative and qualitative findings which were collected and analysed concurrently then separately analysed and published. The research design enabled integration of the quantitative and qualitative findings for further interpretation through a critical pragmatic lens. Setting: a tertiary maternity hospital in Australia providing care to approximately 500 pregnant young women (aged 21 years or less) each year. Three distinct models of care were offered: caseload midwifery, young women 2 ̆ 7 s clinic, and standard 2 ̆ 7 fragmented 2 ̆ 7 care. Participants: a cohort study included data from 1971 young women and babies during 2008 – 2012. An ethnographic study included analysis of focus group interviews with four caseload midwives in the young women 2 ̆ 7 s midwifery group practice; as well as ten pregnant and postnatal young women receiving caseload midwifery care. Findings: integrated analysis of the quantitative and qualitative findings suggested particular features in the model of care which facilitated young women turning up for antenatal care (at an earlier gestation and more frequently) and buying in to the process (disclosing risks, engaging in self-care activities and accepting <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> <b>assistance).</b> We conceptualised that Optimal Caseload Midwifery promotes Synergistic Health Engagement between midwife and the young woman. Key conclusions: optimal Caseload Midwifery (which includes midwives with specific personal attributes and philosophical commitments, along with appropriate institutional infrastructure and support) facilitates midwives and young clients to develop trusting relationships and engage in maternity care. Health engagement can modify predictors for preterm birth that are common amongst pregnant adolescents by promoting earlier maternity booking, sufficient antenatal care, greater emotional resilience, ideal gestational weight gain, less smoking/drug use, and fewer untreated genito-urinary infections. Implications for practice: the institutional infrastructure and managerial support for caseload midwifery should value and prioritise the philosophical commitments and personal attributes required to optimise the model. Furthermore the location of visits, between appointment access to primary midwife, and back-up system should be organised to optimise the midwife-woman relationship in order to promote the young woman 2 ̆ 7 s engagement with maternity care...|$|R

40|$|Levels of {{hospital}} smoking cessation care {{are less than}} optimal. This study aimed to synthesize the evidence regarding the effectiveness of interventions in increasing smoking cessation care provision in hospitals. A review identified relevant studies published between 1994 and 2006. A description of studies, including methodological quality, was undertaken. Intervention effectiveness in increasing smoking cessation care practices was examined for controlled studies using meta-analysis. Care practices examined were assessment of smoking status; advice to quit; counseling or assistance to quit; advising, offering, or providing nicotine replacement therapy (NRT); and follow-up or referral. Of the 25 identified studies, 18 were U. S. based and in inpatient settings. Of the 10 controlled trials, 4 addressed cardiac patients, 5 measured one smoking cessation care practice, and 9 implemented multistrategic interventions (e. g., combining educational meetings with reminders and written resources). The methodology described in these studies was generally of poor quality. Meta-analysis of controlled trials demonstrated a significant intervention effect <b>for</b> provision of <b>assistance</b> and counseling to quit (pooled risk difference = 16. 6, CI = 4. 9 – 28. 3) but not for assessment of smoking status, advice to quit, or the provision or discussion of NRT. Statistical heterogeneity was indicated for all smoking cessation care practices. An insufficient number of studies precluded the use of meta-analysis <b>for</b> follow-up or <b>referral</b> <b>for</b> further <b>assistance.</b> Interventions can be effective in increasing the routine provision {{of hospital}} smoking cessation care. Future research should use more rigorous study design, examine {{a broader range of}} smoking cessation care practices, and focus on hospital-wide intervention implementation...|$|R

Objectives: To analyze the appropriateness of the <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> patch testing among patients seen in our Allergy Unit at the University of Ferrara and to evaluate if an appropriate selection of patients influences the results of the test. Patients and Methods: 1627 consecutive patients were enrolled and 1528 patients were submitted to patch testing. On the basis of history and the clinical picture, the appropriateness of <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> patch test was judged. Results: 82. 30 % of patients attended our Allergy Unit with a clinical presentation and/or history considered an appropriate indication for patch testing. The rate of appropriate <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> patch test from dermatologists was significantly higher (p < 0. 001) when compared with referrals from other physicians. The sensitization rate was significantly higher among the appropriate referrals than in inappropriate ones, both in the entire sample (p < 0. 001) and in atopic patients (p = 0. 012). Conclusions: Clinical experience was seen to be crucial for the appropriate selection of patients.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Fragility {{fractures}} {{indicate a}} significant risk for future fractures and necessitate <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> comprehensive evaluation and risk reduction. Although clinical guidelines describe best practice for falls and fracture prevention, clinical {{use of these}} guidelines may be inadequate. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe fall and bone-related risk factors associated with a positive fall history and <b>referral</b> patterns <b>for</b> physical therapy services in persons with a fragility fracture. METHODS: A comprehensive survey to identify risk factors for osteoporosis, future fracture, and falls, was distributed to 264 adults who sustained a distal radius fragility fracture; 100 adults were included in this study. Chi-square, Fisher’s Exact tests, and odds ratios were performed to analyze associations between risk factors, post-fracture fall history, and <b>referral</b> <b>for</b> exercise. RESULTS: A positive fall history post-fracture was reported by 25 % of the sample and 41 % reported 3 or more fall-related risk factors. Positive history of near falls (OR= 16. 55), fear of falling (OR= 5. 42), poor self-rated general health (OR= 4. 28), and no prescription for calcium/vitamin D supplementation (OR= 7. 00) were significantly associated with positive fall history post-fracture. Only 16 % of the sample was referred for exercise or fall prevention post-fracture. <b>Referral</b> <b>for</b> osteoporosis evaluation (OR= 3. 28) and calcium supplement prescription (OR= 3. 21) were the only factors significantly associated with <b>referral</b> <b>for</b> exercise. There was no <b>referral</b> <b>for</b> exercise in 80 % of subjects who experienced frequent falls post-fracture. CONCLUSIONS: These results illustrate a gap between best practice guidelines for secondary prevention and current clinical management in individuals with fragility fracture...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{measure the}} effect on general {{practitioner}} <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> radiography of introducing guidelines of good practice together with monitoring and peer review. DESIGN [...] Collection of referral data during 1 January 1989 to 31 December 1990. Guidelines were introduced on 1 January 1990. SETTING [...] Open access radiology services provided by one non-teaching district in England. SUBJECTS [...] 144614 registered patients from 22 practices. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Number of referrals per 1000 registered patients for radiography of the chest, skull, spine, abdomen, limbs, and joints and for barium investigation and excretion urography. RESULTS [...] Overall referrals fell from 88. 4 / 1000 registered patients to 77. 2 / 1000 after the guidelines were introduced. The commonest reasons <b>for</b> <b>referral</b> were <b>for</b> examination of the chest, spine, and limbs and joints and <b>referrals</b> <b>for</b> these fell by 9. 4 %, 17. 5 %, and 13. 5 % respectively. <b>Referrals</b> <b>for</b> skull radiography fell by 30 % (from 241 to 168).
