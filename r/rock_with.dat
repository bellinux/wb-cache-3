40|$|General EcologyThe {{possible}} commensal {{relationship between}} benthic algae and zebra mussels occupying the same rocky substrate was studied at Douglas Lake in Pellston, Michigan. Chlorophyll a tests {{were used to}} analyze benthic algae concentrations on three different treatments: <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live zebra mussels, <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> dead zebra mussels, and <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> no zebra mussels with expectations to find that <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels have higher benthic algae concentrations than <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> no zebra mussels, and <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live zebra mussels have higher benthic algae density than <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> dead zebra mussels. The study was divided into field survey, field study and laboratory study. In the field survey, I observed a trend that showed higher benthic algae concentration on <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels; however, it was statistically insignificant. I compared the chlorophyll a concentration found on <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live and dead zebra mussels <b>with</b> <b>rocks</b> without zebra mussels for the field and laboratory studies, and found {{a significant difference in}} the field study, which showed that <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels had higher benthic algae concentration. Finally, I compared <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> live zebra mussels and dead zebra mussels and found an insignificant difference between the two treatments for the field and laboratory study, even though the trends showed a higher concentration of benthic algae on <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> dead zebra mussels. Since <b>rocks</b> <b>with</b> zebra mussels showed a higher concentration of benthic algae in general, a commensal relationship between the two organisms is possible...|$|R

5|$|Psychedelic <b>rock,</b> <b>with</b> its {{distorted}} guitar sound, extended solos and adventurous compositions, {{has been}} seen as an important bridge between blues-oriented rock and later heavy metal. American bands whose loud, repetitive psychedelic rock emerged as early heavy metal included the Amboy Dukes and Steppenwolf. From England, two former guitarists with the Yardbirds, Jeff Beck and Jimmy Page, moved on to form key acts in the genre, The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin respectively. Other major pioneers of the genre had begun as blues-based psychedelic bands, including Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Judas Priest and UFO. Psychedelic music also contributed to the origins of glam <b>rock,</b> <b>with</b> Marc Bolan changing his psychedelic folk duo into rock band T. Rex and becoming the first glam rock star from 1970. From 1971 David Bowie moved on from his early psychedelic work to develop his Ziggy Stardust persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} an object is a rough guide to its composition: the lower the density, the higher the {{fraction}} of ices, and the lower the fraction of rock. The n denser objects, Vesta and Juno, are composed almost entirely of <b>rock</b> <b>with</b> very little ice, and have a density close to the Moon's, while the less dense, such as Proteus and Enceladus, are composed mainly of ice.|$|E
5|$|The new {{research}} suggests that the rocky centres of super-Earths are unlikely to evolve into terrestrial rocky planets like the inner planets of our Solar System because they appear to hold on to their large atmospheres. Rather than evolving to a planet composed mainly of <b>rock</b> <b>with</b> a thin atmosphere, the small rocky core remains engulfed by its large hydrogen-rich envelope.|$|E

5|$|World War II {{dramatically}} {{changed the}} lives of Gibraltarians. The decision to enforce mass evacuation {{in order to increase}} the strength of the <b>Rock</b> <b>with</b> more military and naval personnel meant that most Gibraltarians (some for up to ten years) had nowhere to call 'home'.

5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of <b>rock,</b> <b>with</b> 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers to move up the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E

5|$|Audioslave was an American rock {{supergroup}} {{formed in}} Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave {{as a combination}} of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, {{it was noted that}} they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard <b>rock</b> <b>with</b> 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals.|$|E
5|$|Hardcore, punk, and garage rock {{were the}} roots of {{alternative}} rock, a diverse grouping of rock subgenres that were explicitly opposed to mainstream music, and that arose from the punk and post-punk styles. In the United States, many cities developed local alternative rock scenes, including Minneapolis and Seattle. Seattle's local scene produced grunge music, a dark and brooding style inspired by hardcore, psychedelia, and alternative <b>rock.</b> <b>With</b> {{the addition of a}} more melodic element to the sound of bands like Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains, grunge became wildly popular across the United States in 1991. Three years later, bands like Green Day, The Offspring, Rancid, Bad Religion, and NOFX hit the mainstream (with their respective then-new albums Dookie, Smash, Let's Go, Stranger than Fiction and Punk in Drublic) and brought the California punk scene exposure worldwide.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created the pill but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John <b>Rock</b> <b>with</b> help from the Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E

5|$|In her legend, Haumea's many {{children}} came from {{different parts of}} her body. The dwarf planet Haumea appears to be almost entirely made of <b>rock,</b> <b>with</b> only a superficial layer of ice; most of the original icy mantle is thought to have been blasted off by the impact that spun Haumea into its current high speed of rotation, where the material formed into the small Kuiper belt objects in Haumea's collisional family. There could therefore be additional outer moons, smaller than Namaka, that have not yet been detected. However, HST observations have confirmed that no other moons brighter than 0.25% of the brightness of Haumea exist within the closest tenth of the distance (0.1% of the volume) where they could be held by Haumea's gravitational influence (its Hill sphere). This makes it unlikely that any more exist.|$|E

5|$|Kawada's musical style mainly fuses <b>rock</b> <b>with</b> trance. When Kawada {{debuted in}} 2001, she {{originally}} {{felt that the}} music she earned in her career was pocket money. She also felt happy {{that she could be}} based in Sapporo where she could be close to her family and friends, as well as to I've Sound who she felt was like a second family to her. After Kotoko made her major debut in 2004, I've Sound management began discussing the possibility of Kawada making a major debut. At first, she was hesitant because she felt that she would be thrust into the spotlight, but eventually she accepted the idea. For the first ten years of her career, she always felt that she was a beginner, but this began to change when younger singers made their debuts and began to treat her as an older sister.|$|E

5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic <b>rock</b> <b>with</b> reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from the toe of the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E
5|$|Mercyful Fate is a Danish {{heavy metal}} band from Copenhagen, formed in 1981 by vocalist King Diamond and guitarist Hank Shermann. Influenced by {{progressive}} rock and hard <b>rock,</b> <b>with</b> lyrics dealing with Satan and the occult, Mercyful Fate {{were part of}} the first wave of black metal in the early to mid-1980s. Many of the bands from this movement went on to influence later black metal musicians in the 1990s, particularly in Norway. Since the band's inception in 1981, Mercyful Fate have released seven studio albums, two extended plays and four compilations.|$|E
5|$|Pillars and columns, such as Washington Column and Lost Arrow, {{are created}} by cross joints. Erosion acting on master joints is {{responsible}} for creating valleys and later canyons. The single most erosive force {{over the last few}} million years has been large alpine glaciers, which have turned the previously V-shaped river-cut valleys into U-shaped glacial-cut canyons (such as Yosemite Valley and Hetch Hetchy Valley). Exfoliation (caused by the tendency of crystals in plutonic rocks to expand at the surface) acting on granitic <b>rock</b> <b>with</b> widely spaced joints is responsible for creating domes such as Half Dome and North Dome and inset arches like Royal Arches.|$|E
