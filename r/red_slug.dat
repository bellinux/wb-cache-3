40|$|Several {{thousand}} {{plant species}} worldwide are adapted to seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) {{and they are}} a dominant part of many plant communities, {{as is the case in}} European beech forests. Ants, however, are often rare in beech forests. The consequence of this paradox might be that the majority of seeds fall prey to seed predators and myrmecochores migrate mostly by vegetative spread. I compared ant, gastropod and myrmecochore abundance data from beech forests and I conducted seed removal experiments. Gastropods contributed most to the seed removal. Therefore I offered seeds to four gastropod species in the laboratory and I collected <b>red</b> <b>slugs</b> (Arion rufus) in beech forests and searched for seeds in their feces. I tested their dispersal potential by assessing germination rates of slug-defecated seeds and distances <b>red</b> <b>slugs</b> move in the field. The cover and species richness of myrmecochores in beech forests was negatively correlated with the abundance of ants but positively with the abundance of gastropods, supporting my assumption of a discrepancy in the presence of plants and their ant-dispersers. Gastropods were most important for seed removal in my removal experiments, while rodents and insects including ants played only a minor role. Laboratory feeding experiments showed that gastropods consumed seeds of all plant species offered. Swallowed seeds were defecated undamaged and germinated as well as control seeds. I also discovered seeds in the feces of wild-caught <b>red</b> <b>slugs.</b> Thus, gastropods may act as seed dispersers. Red slugs moved up to 14. 6 m in 15 hours, the median gut passage time of seeds, and thus, might transport seeds even further than ants. The results of my experiments indicate that myrmecochores might lack ants as their seed dispersers in beech forests, but they also suggest that ants could be substituted by gastropods...|$|R
50|$|Like {{most other}} slug species, the <b>red</b> <b>slug</b> elongates while in locomotion, and at rest it {{contracts}} into a hemispherical shape. It performs a rocking motion when disturbed. It is an omnivore.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that the Spanish slug has bred with the indigenous black slug Arion ater to produce a more frost-resistant variety in the more northerly regions. Danish authorities maintain that the Spanish slug, black slug and <b>red</b> <b>slug</b> are in fact subspecies of the same species.|$|E
50|$|Often such {{complexes}} {{only become}} evident {{when a new}} species is introduced into the system, breaking down existing species barriers. An example is {{the introduction of the}} Spanish slug in Northern Europe, where interbreeding with the local black slug and <b>red</b> <b>slug,</b> traditionally considered clearly separate species that did not interbreed, shows they may be actually just subspecies of the same species.|$|E

50|$|The park protects a {{wide range}} of biomes, {{including}} semi-arid woodland, subalpine heath, and eucalypt forests, and provides a habitat for a range of animals, including bats, birds, wallabies, quolls, and the unique <b>red</b> triangle <b>slug</b> (Triboniophorus graeffei), which is known to appear after rainfall.|$|R
50|$|The black slug is {{generally}} deep black, with some adults being brown or even white. Generally, pigmentation darkens directly with increasing latitude. Young specimens {{tend to be}} brown or ivory whitish, turning to grey before becoming characteristically black at maturity. Rust-brown individuals are arguably classified as a separate species Arion rufus (<b>Red</b> <b>Slug).</b> And the two can only be distinguished by dissecting the reproductive anatomy.|$|E
40|$|Background: Seed {{dispersal}} of ant-dispersed plants (myrmecochores) {{is a well}} studied ecosystem function. Recently, slugs {{have been found to}} act as seed dispersers of myrmecochores. The aim of our study was to (1) further generalize the finding that gastropods feed on seeds of myrmecochores and hence may act as seed dispersers, (2) to test whether gastropod body mass and the volume of diaspores have an influence on the seed dispersal potential. Methodology and Principal Findings: We assessed the seed dispersal potential of four slug and snail species with a set of seven myrmecochorous plant species from seven different plant families common to Central European beech forests. Diaspores differed in shape and size. Gastropods differed in their readiness to feed on diaspores and in the proportion of seeds that were swallowed as a whole, and this readiness generally decreased with increasing diaspore size. Smaller Arionid slugs (58 mm body length; mean) mostly fed on the elaiosome but also swallowed small diaspores and therefore not only act as elaiosome consumers, a nutrient rich appendage on myrmecochorous diaspores, but may also disperse seeds. Large Arionid slugs (. 100 mm body length) swallowed diaspores of all sizes. Diaspores swallowed by gastropods were defecated without damage. Within-species variability in body size also affect seed dispersal potential, as larger individuals of the <b>red</b> <b>slug</b> (Arion rufus) swallowed more diaspores of wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) than smaller ones. Conclusions and Significance: Our results help to generalize the finding that gastropods consume and potentially disperse seeds of myrmecochores. The dispersal potential of gastropods is strongly influenced by diaspore size in relation to gastropod size...|$|E
50|$|The {{mountain}} {{is home to}} a giant, fluorescent pink slug, which can grow up to 20 cm in length. This pink subspecies of the <b>red</b> triangle <b>slug</b> is found only on this single mountaintop. The peak is an isolated habitat island on which endemic invertebrates and plant species have existed for millions of years. According to a park ranger there are three species of cannibal snails on the mountain.|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} Tapeigaster flies have been {{collected}} from the fruit bodies, including T.cinctipes, T.annulipes, and T.nigricornis; the latter species uses the fruit bodies as a host to rear its young. Fruit bodies in Springbrook National Park have been observed to attract nocturnal insects such as beetles, native cockroaches and crickets (white-kneed cricket (Papuastus spp.) and thorny cricket), as well as giant rainforest snails (Hedleyella falconeri) and <b>red</b> triangle <b>slugs</b> (Triboniophorus graeffei), which voraciously consume the fungus.|$|R

50|$|The game {{begins with}} Reemus and Liam resting near {{a fire in}} the night. Reemus protests against Liam's doubts that the king summoned them to the castle to give Reemus his daughter's hand in marriage. Then a wolf-like {{creature}} chases them through the woods. Eventually they shake the creature off and arrive at the castle.Apparently the castle is deserted. Liam finds his way in and lets Reemus in {{on the other side of}} the door, but the creature finds them again and they are forced to take shelter inside a dark room. In it is a strange pulsating purple object. In a trapdoor in the ceiling, they find a wizard who is retrieving his 'magical food recipes' and tells them to climb through the trapdoor into the room above. In the relative safety of the room, they watch the purple object slowly drop small <b>red</b> <b>slugs</b> onto the floor. The wizard tells them they are a new species called 'Death Slug', and are what caused the castle's other inhabitants to flee. Then the slugs crawl outside and almost immediately kill the wolf-like creature. The wizard explains that Reemus was summoned to rid the castle of the Death Slugs. The wizard then flees from the castle on a cake lighter than air, leaving Reemus and Liam to brainstorm a way to escape. They manage to do so by using the wizard's potions.This game has two possible endings:1. They catch a bird and use a potion to make it gigantic. They fly away on the bird, but the spell runs out, and they both fall off.2. They catch a rat and use some potions to make it giant flying rat. They fly away, but a giant flying cat pounces the rat, not harming the duo, but taking away their ride.|$|R

50|$|The Pirates {{started the}} Game 3 scoring by {{a run in}} the first inning off Tony Cloninger, who averted {{disaster}} three times before Anderson finally yanked him for a pinch-hitter in the fifth with the score 2-2. The <b>slugging</b> <b>Reds</b> uncorked their only power show of the playoffs {{in the first inning}}, Tony Pérez and Johnny Bench smacking successive homers off Bob Moose. Pirate starter Moose showed more courage than stuff in the early going. But he hung on and proceeded to halt the Reds until he had two outs in the eighth. Then he walked pinch-hitter Ty Cline and gave up a single to Pete Rose.|$|R
