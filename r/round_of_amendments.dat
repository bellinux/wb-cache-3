40|$|The Rules {{have been}} amended {{many times in}} the forty years since they were enacted. Unlike the {{original}} drafting process, which necessarily involved consideration of the Rules as a whole, each <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> was limited to a specific Rule or set of Rules. This particularized focus is not myopic, but unavoidable; the Rules are numerous and complex, and the time of the Advisory Committee and Congress is limited. But after more than forty years, a broader perspective is possible. The purpose of this Article is to provide a small bit of that perspective, which this Article distills into three “commandments” for amending the Rules. After a brief history of the residual exception and a description of the proposed amendment, this Article considers the extent to which that proposal complies with these commandments...|$|E
2500|$|Rules mandating {{pictorial}} warnings {{on tobacco}} products were notified on 3 May 2009 came into force from 31 May 2009 after several <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> and delays. Section 7 of COTPA {{deals with the}} [...] "Display of pictorial health warning on all tobacco products packets". It prohibits the production, sale and import of cigarettes or any other tobacco product unless every package of cigarettes or any other tobacco product bears pictorial warnings on its label covering at least 40% of the package. The warnings are changed once a year. The law also prohibited more than two languages from being used on the pack {{to ensure that the}} specified warning is legible and prominent.|$|R

[...] The Charlottetown Accord did not propose any transfers of power {{from the federal government}} to the provincial governments (although it did confirm that certain powers already exercised by the provinces would be recognized as their exclusive powers). The Liberal Party then held a convention which approved the Charlottetown Accord, over the objections of Jean Allaire and the Liberal Party Youth Commission president, Mario Dumont.|$|R
25|$|In September 2011, Hans Reiser filed a civil lawsuit. In his {{complaint}} {{he named}} more than 70 defendants, including trial judges and his attorney, William H. Du Bois. He claimed, among other things, that his attorney conspired {{with the judge}} to file motions against him, which were impossible to appeal, and that his attorney had forced {{him to take the}} stand against his will. After several <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> and additional complaints, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice, which means that Reiser can no longer file civil lawsuits regarding his current convictions. The judges voiced several errors before the dismissal. According to the judges: Reiser's complaint was too long (more than 300 pages in its original form). He had too many defendants, and they included judges, who are immune to lawsuits regarding their official conduct. Finally, the judges could not decide whether there was a cause of action (any illegal deed or event, which could be prosecuted) to accept the plea. Reiser argued that he had not had access to the prison law library and that he had been denied the appointment of an attorney to help him formulate his complaint.|$|R
40|$|This article {{critically}} {{examines the}} legislative definition of rape in Queensland, {{ten years after}} the last <b>round</b> <b>of</b> major <b>amendments</b> in 2000. It begins by examining the approach of the Queensland Court of Appeal to the central notion of consent, focusing on cases decided since the amendments. The article then considers the role played by the defence of mistake of fact under s 24 of the Criminal Code 1899 (Qld) in a number of recent appeals from rape convictions. It is argued that the Queensland legislature should consider significantly limiting the application of s 24 to the offence of rape...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on all text {{received}} since the conference was announced late in 2009. Prospective participants were informed that no individual papers were expected but that the conference would be structured around one document, baptized ‘Lead-paper’, that would go through several <b>rounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendments,</b> additions, criticisms and alterations in the months ahead, aiming at a discussion document that would already represent views of participants and {{would allow us to}} begin our conference with a common knowledge based on our exchange of data, views, and questions, making the conference the more fruitful. This proposition led to a 1 st version of the Lead-paper (5 pages, 2000 words) December 30, 2009, going through a 2 nd edition (31 January 2010, 12 pages, 5152 words), a 3 rd edition (1 March, 50 pages, 17. 850 words) and a 4 th edition (70 pages plus 14 pages attachments, 29. 777 words), e-mailed on March 26, 2010, to all participants and distributed in Deventer at the opening session on 8 April 2010 in print. This 4 th edition ‘Lead-paper’ was used as the substantial agenda for the conference on 8 - 9 April 2010 in Deventer. This is the 5 th edition which incorporates substantial thoughts, criticism, questions, and remarks contributed in writing, by the participants and from other sources...|$|R
40|$|On December 1, 2000, several Amendments to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure took effect. Mandatory initial disclosure, {{which had}} been so {{controversial}} during (and following) the making <b>of</b> the 1993 <b>Amendments</b> and was subject to variation according to local rule, has now been made mandatory and nationally uniform. Disclosure 2 ̆ 7 s fangs were removed, or at least blunted, because Rule 26 (a) (1) now requires only that a party disclose information supporting its contentions. Rule 30 (d) (2) now provides that a deposition should normally not exceed one day of seven hours. The sanction rules have been modified but not dramatically changed. However, one amendment-narrowing the scope of discovery available under Rule 26 (b) (1) -was particularly controversial before the Advisory Committee, the Standing Committee, and the Judicial Conference. It is a change that had periodically been raised for decades before the most recent <b>round</b> <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> discussion. Amended Rule 26 (b) (1) replaces the venerable “relevant-to-the-subject-matter” standard for the scope of discovery with the narrower “relevant-to-a-claim-or-defense” standard. The amendment also allows a party to bring a motion to expand the scope of discovery, upon a showing of “good cause,” to the “subject-matter” standard that prevailed prior to December 1, 2000. One trial judge who opposed the change in discovery scope predicted ten years 2 ̆ 7 worth of litigation to determine the application of new Rule 26 (b) (1) as courts struggle to define and apply the new baseline standard of “claim-or-defense” relevancy {{and the provision of}} the new Rule that permits discovery as broad as the former “subject-matter” standard of relevance once a party has demonstrated “good cause. ” Undoubtedly, this judge is at least partially correct. Sorting out the meaning of the new scope standard will take some time and courts should expect extensive motion practice seeking to enforce or avoid the constrictions of the rule. The nature of the definition of scope necessarily uses open-ended words whose application to concrete fact situations will not always be obvious. This article offers some guidance on the new rule in hopes of streamlining the period of uncertainty and nonuniformity. Other changes to the Rules in the 2000 Amendments should prove less difficult to apply. For example, the presumptive deposition limit of a seven-hour day is objective and verifiable. At the same time, lawyers know immediately that the deposition time limit should not be read hyperliterally and will be subject to common sense application by the courts. The literal meaning and the common sense contours of Rule 26 (b) (1) are less easily agreed upon...|$|R
40|$|Based on {{literature}} review {{piece by piece}} methods <b>of</b> <b>round</b> wood measurements employed in different countries are briefly discussed. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>round</b> wood volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 {{in comparison with the}} Lithuanian volume tables showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in “Lithuanian” volumes (up to 10 % for butt and middle logs and 15 % – for top logs, although for butt logs over 70 cm diameter the differences in their volumes are around 2 % only). The main working method of upper diameter (STB 1667 - 2012, GOST 2708 – 75) was researched. 194 logs in 6 stacked batches were measured (diameters at both ends of a log (twice, rounding to 0. 1 cm), and length (0. 1 m)). The greatest deviations have been received when logs with increased taper coefficient (1 – 2 cm/m) are inventoried (– 14. 5 % according to the formula of the “end cross-sections” (SmalIana) and – 13. 1 % – using formula of “truncated cone”). In our view, it is advisable to clarify the method of upper diameter based on the average value of taper coefficient in stacked batches <b>of</b> <b>round</b> wood (entering <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> to the volumes from GOST 2708 – 75 on a log taper coefficient of real value) ...|$|R

An analysis <b>of</b> <b>round</b> wood volume tables from GOST 2708 – 75 in comparison with control data showed positive values of deviations that indicates larger values in standard volumes (GOST 2708 – 75) (up to 13 % for medium-sized (24 cm) and large (over 24 cm) round wood). However, for logs with taper coefficient more than 1 cm/m) negative deviations are characterized, which, in turn, suggests an underestimation of wood volume in the standard tables {{in relation to the}} control data of formulas Smaliana and truncated cone (– 18 %). Formula Smaliana versus frustoconical formula underestimates the timber volume (however, not more than 1 %). Obviously, both of these formulas can be used to determine the amount of measurement errors by the method of upper diameter.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} make a {{critical}} review of {{the current status of}} the constitionalised panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) in India as institutions of self government and as instruments of planning for economic development and social justice in the light of empirical evidence collected by the researchers and critical analysis of the some of the actions of state. The background of the rise of the "new" panchayat system has been narrated in a nut shell to enable the readers to have an idea of the conceptual and institutional framework of the panchayat system Keeping the central objective in mind the article focuses on the challenges faced by the third generation PRIs in India from within and without and attempts {{to make a}}n assessment about the future of these institutions. Reference has been made to the experience of some of the states in order to support the comments and observations. The article argues that despite the constitutional amendment to regenerate the PRIs there is still lack of genuine and strong political interest and bureaucratic support to fuel the institutions. These have been manifested in the actions of the state after the constitution has been amended. The traditional factors rooted in the socio-economic structure and political dynamics of the rural society continue to plague the working of these democratic institutions. It has been contended that there is need for another <b>round</b> <b>of</b> constitutional <b>amendment</b> coupled with continuous political and administrative support to ensure steady growth of the PRIs. The author finds a ray of hope in the rise of civil society organizations which have started acting as watchdogs in some of the states. They are working not only for generating awareness among the stakeholders but also for organizing the villagers to assert their rights and in this respect, the right to information has come as great boon...|$|R
