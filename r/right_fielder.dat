5|$|After the Brewers traded <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Norichika Aoki to the Royals for pitcher Will Smith, Braun {{moved to}} right field, opening {{a spot for}} Khris Davis to play left field.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Braun {{moved to}} right {{field for the}} Brewers after <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Norichika Aoki {{was traded to the}} Royals, opening a spot for Khris Davis to play left field. In 2016, Braun moved back to left field.|$|E
5|$|Kemp {{became the}} {{starting}} <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> in 2008. He hit his first career grand slam off of Mark Redman on April 26 against the Colorado Rockies. Kemp drove {{in the first}} run of the game for the Dodgers, a sacrifice fly {{in the first inning}} that scored Juan Pierre.|$|E
5000|$|After {{getting a}} chance to become a regular in , playing 101 games, Hawpe had a [...]262 batting average with 9 home runs and 47 RBIs. In , Hawpe hit [...]293 with 22 home runs and 84 RBIs. He also led all MLB <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> in assists (16) and all National League <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> in fielding {{percentage}} (.987). In , he hit [...]291 with 29 home runs and 116 RBIs. Defensively, though, he had the lowest range factor (1.83) of all NL <b>right</b> <b>fielders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|He {{was also}} a finalist for his first Gold Glove Award in right field, but lost to Kole Calhoun of the Angels. His 15 outfield assists ranked second in the AL, his [...]993 fielding {{percentage}} led all AL <b>right</b> <b>fielders,</b> and his 7.7 ultimate zone rating ranked second among AL <b>right</b> <b>fielders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Corner outfielders are outfielders {{who play}} the corner {{positions}} of right field and left field. Corner outfielders often have less speed than center fielders, but {{make up for}} this deficiency with their offensive play. The main differences between left and <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> are, first, that left fielders handle more chances because right-handed pull hitters tend to hit balls to left; second, that <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> typically have stronger arms; third, that <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> are frequently (not always) slower and less agile defensively. Many left fielders have had the speed to play center field, but have lacked the throwing ability required.|$|R
5|$|Shuey {{attended}} Millbrook High School in Raleigh, North Carolina. With Millbrook, Shuey was {{a starting}} pitcher and <b>right</b> <b>fielder.</b> While pitching for {{the baseball team}} at Millbrook, Shuey threw a no-hitter against Garner High School. He was named to North Carolina's All-Triangle and All-State teams.|$|E
5|$|Granderson {{agreed to}} terms with the New York Mets on a {{four-year}} contract worth $60million on December 6, 2013. Granderson's salaries were set at $13 million in 2014, $16 million in 2015 and 2016, and $15 million in 2017. The Mets played Granderson as their <b>right</b> <b>fielder.</b> He started 148 games with 130 in right field.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Bruce Vick (April 12, 1895 – August 17, 1986) was an American {{professional}} <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> in Major League Baseball. He {{played for}} the New York Yankees from 1917 to 1920, and the Boston Red Sox in 1921. He stood , and weighed 163lb., and he batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Batesville, Mississippi, and attended Millsaps College in Jackson, Mississippi.|$|E
5000|$|His {{obituary}} ranked him [...] "with Mel Ott {{as one of}} the two greatest <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> in New York Giant history." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, he led all Major League <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> in errors, with 9, and had {{the lowest}} fielding {{percentage}} among them, [...]966.|$|R
50|$|By primary fielding {{position}} the nominees were starting pitchers (66), relief pitchers (9), catchers (10), first basemen (24), second basemen (8), third basemen (13), shortstops (19), left fielders (18), center <b>fielders</b> (17) and <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> (16).|$|R
5|$|Two Phillies {{have made}} 30% {{or more of}} their Phillies {{appearances}} as both pitchers and position players. In addition to Edgar Smith's batting notes above, he amassed a 15.43 ERA as a pitcher, striking out two. John Strike was hitless in seven plate appearances as a <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> while amassing a 11 record as a pitcher.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Rawlings Gold Glove Award, the prize is {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one <b>right</b> <b>fielder.</b> It is also possible for outfield teammates to win the award in the same season, which has happened eight times since 1980.|$|E
5|$|Joss {{made his}} major league debut with the Cleveland Bronchos (also {{known as the}} Bluebirds) against the St. Louis Browns. The Browns' Jesse Burkett hit a shallow pop fly in the {{direction}} of <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Zaza Harvey. Home plate umpire Bob Caruthers ruled that Harvey did not make a clean catch, so Burkett was credited with a hit. (Harvey and witnesses said the ball never hit the ground.) Joss finished his major league debut with a one-hitter.|$|E
50|$|By primary fielding {{position}} the nominees were starting pitchers (67), relief pitchers (10), catchers (10), first basemen (21), second basemen (5), third basemen (11), shortstops (18), left fielders (17), center <b>fielders</b> (22) and <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> (19).|$|R
50|$|Players can be {{characterized}} as either corner outfielders or a center fielder. Corner outfielders are often slower and have less defensive value than the center fielder. However, there are some important differences between <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> and left <b>fielders.</b> <b>Right</b> <b>fielders</b> tend to have the best throwing arms of the outfield so they can make the long throw to third base, but often are not as fast as left fielders. Center fielders are generally the fastest and most athletic of the three, because they have to run the farthest in order to field balls in the gaps and back up the other outfielders when balls are hit to them.|$|R
5000|$|Markakis {{finished}} {{his rookie season}} with a [...]291 average, 16 homers, 62 RBI and 2 stolen bases. On defense, he put up impressive stats in defensive ratings such as range factor and fielding percentage, ranking second among major league <b>right</b> <b>fielders.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{prize is}} {{presented}} to outfielders irrespective of their specific position. This means {{that it is possible}} for three left fielders, or any other combination of outfielders, to win the award in the same year, rather than one left fielder, one center fielder, and one <b>right</b> <b>fielder.</b> In addition, only National League pitchers receive a Silver Slugger Award; lineups in the American League include a designated hitter in place of the pitcher in the batting order, so the designated hitter receives the award instead.|$|E
5|$|While {{with the}} Senators, Bordagaray raced a horse in a 100-yard dash, losing {{by a few}} feet. During a game, Bordagaray {{reportedly}} went to use the toilet during the ninth inning. While he was off the field, the pitcher threw the ball, unaware he had no <b>right</b> <b>fielder.</b> The batter hit the pitch to right field, leading to a double. Manager Earl McNeely did not criticize Bordagaray, rather telling the pitcher {{to make sure his}} fielders were in place before throwing.|$|E
5|$|Two {{players have}} won a {{championship}} with the team; Bobby Grich (1967), who {{was a part of}} the 1970 World Series championship team, and Rich Dauer (1974), who {{was a part of the}} 1983 World Series championship team. None of the Orioles' first-round picks have been elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame. One pick, Gregg Olson (1988), has won the MLB Rookie of the Year Award; he won the award in 1989. The Orioles had the first overall selection once in the draft, which they used on Ben McDonald (1989). Jayson Werth (1997) was originally drafted as a catcher, but was converted to a <b>right</b> <b>fielder,</b> and primarily plays that position in the major leagues.|$|E
500|$|Developed by the {{organization}} that awards The Fielding Bible, defensive runs saved (DRS) measures a player's total defensive plays made in terms of numbers of runs above or below what the average player at that position made. [...] A calculation system computes the number of plays made league-wide at each position and a plus-minus total rating for each player compared to a league average player. [...] For example, if Heyward made a play that only 20% of <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> would make, he was credited with [...]8 points – or, 1 point minus [...]20. [...] If he failed to make a play that 75% of <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> made, then [...]75 points was subtracted from his score.|$|R
50|$|First basemen, with 6 winners, {{have won}} the most among all positions. One catcher has also won the award. Six outfielders {{have won the}} Player of the Year Award; three were <b>right</b> <b>fielders,</b> two were left fielders, and one was a center fielder.|$|R
5000|$|An {{example of}} an {{ultra-fast}} left fielder is Rickey Henderson (Ben Oglivie and Lou Brock can fit this description too), whereas the slow-footed but very strong-armed Carl Furillo, [...] "The Reading Rifle," [...] sets a standard for <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> in the terms specified here.|$|R
5|$|Groth {{was born}} in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania to William T. and Clara Court Groth. He played American Legion Baseball in East Palestine, Ohio in his teens, and {{attended}} Beaver Falls High School. He grew up pitching in the county league, and was both a <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> and pitcher for the Chippewa Indians. After pitching for Chippewa in 1941, he was offered a contract for the 1942 season by the Pittsburgh Pirates. Groth turned down the offer instead signing with the Cleveland Indians, spending the 1942 season with the Indians' D-Class (Rookie League) affiliate, the Appleton Papermakers of the Wisconsin State League, where he played alongside future teammate Mike Garcia. In 26 games, he pitched in 203 innings, had a 16–10 win–loss record and a 3.59 ERA.|$|E
5|$|Paciorek, {{who was the}} {{starting}} <b>right</b> <b>fielder,</b> began {{the day with a}} walk in the second inning. He then had a single in the fourth inning, which drove in Rusty Staub and Bob Aspromonte. After singling and again bringing home Aspromonte in the fifth, Paciorek had a walk in the sixth, and ended the day with a leadoff single in the eighth. In total, he went to the plate five times and hit three singles and had two walks, scoring four runs en route to a 134 Houston victory over the New York Mets. He had a perfect major league career batting average and on-base percentage of 1.000 {{as a result of his}} performance that day, something no one else with as many plate appearances as Paciorek has done.|$|E
5|$|Sounds <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Caleb Gindl {{became the}} third player in team history to hit for the cycle when he {{accomplished}} the feat on July 10, 2011. Center fielder Logan Schafer garnered national media attention when he initiated a triple play on August 20, 2011, against the Omaha Storm Chasers. What made the rare occurrence even more unusual {{is that the}} ball first bounced off Schafer's glove and head before landing in his glove for the first out. He then returned {{the ball to the}} infield where second baseman Eric Farris and first baseman Mat Gamel completed the triple play by stepping on their respective bases. With Money at the helm, Nashville ended the year with a 71–73 record, placing third in their division.|$|E
5000|$|He missed time in [...] with a {{hamstring}} injury, {{but still}} managed to hit [...]283 with 25 home runs and 85 RBIs. Defensively, however, Hawpe had the lowest fielding percentage (.956) and range factor (1.50), and most errors (9), of all major league <b>right</b> <b>fielders.</b>|$|R

5|$|The Philadelphia Phillies' 2014 {{season was}} the 132nd {{in the history}} of the franchise. After a disappointing 2013, the Phillies entered the offseason with a {{strategy}} to reload rather than rebuild; they did not want to relinquish the opportunity to do well in 2014 in hopes of being competitive down the road. Commensurate with this strategy, among their key acquisitions were <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Marlon Byrd and starting pitcher A. J. Burnett. The Phillies began the season with new coaches (as Ryne Sandberg entered his first season as manager after taking over on an interim basis in August 2013) and new broadcasters; Jamie Moyer and Matt Stairs, two members of the 2008 World Series squad, replaced Chris Wheeler and Gary Matthews as analysts on Comcast SportsNet Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Just days later, Yankee <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Gary Sheffield's cap {{was knocked}} {{off by a}} Red Sox fan while {{trying to pick up}} a fair ball in right field during the 8th inning at Fenway Park. In response, Sheffield pushed the fan. The {{conflict}} was quickly stopped by security guards. The fan was not ejected from the game, although left the park voluntarily. Fan interference was not called and Sheffield's reaction resulted in a run scoring Triple for the Red Sox' Jason Varitek. It was the game-winning RBI. Contrary to most media reports, the fan is still a season ticket holder today. The season ended with both teams, already with guaranteed playoff berths, playing each other for the division crown {{on the last day of}} the season in a game that had the Yankees come out on top. Both teams wound up losing in the 2005 ALDS, the Yankees to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim and the Red Sox to the eventual World Series champion that year, the Chicago White Sox.|$|E
5|$|Of this list's 59 pitchers, four {{share the}} best win–loss record, {{in terms of}} winning percentage; Fred Wenz won two games and lost none in his Phillies career, while Bob Wells, Deke White, and Mike Zagurski each earned a win in their only decisions. Rick Wise leads all members of this list in {{victories}} (75) and defeats (76), {{and is one of}} ten Phillies pitchers to throw a no-hitter, accomplishing the feat on June 23, 1971. Randy Wolf leads in strikeouts, having thrown 971 in his eight-season Phillies career. The earned run average (ERA) leaders are Huck Wallace and Dan Warthen; each amassed a 0.00 ERA by allowing no earned runs in their Phillies careers. One position player, <b>right</b> <b>fielder</b> Glenn Wilson, also sports a 0.00 ERA after his only pitching appearance with Philadelphia. Among players who have allowed runs, Billy Wagner's 1.86 ERA is best. Leaders among the Y- and Z-named pitchers include Floyd Youmans (1 win, 5.70 ERA, 20 strikeouts), Zagurski (36 strikeouts), and Tom Zachary (4.26 ERA).|$|E
50|$|One of five NL <b>right</b> <b>fielders</b> to {{register}} 11 total chances {{in a game}} (1945). The others are Harry Schafer (1877), Greasy Neale (1920), Casey Stengel (1920) and Bake McBride (1978). The major league record is held by Tony Armas, who handled 12 chances in an AL game (1982).|$|R
