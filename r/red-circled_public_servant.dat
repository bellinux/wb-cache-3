The type and degree of political activities that a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> {{can engage in}} depends on several factors, such as the visibility of the political activities that the <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> wants to engage in and the visibility of the <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> in their job in the public service.|$|R

50|$|The {{reasons behind}} s 44(iv), {{so far as}} it {{concerns}} <b>public</b> <b>servants,</b> were said to derive from traditions of the British House of Commons: that a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> could not simultaneously attend adequately to both the duties of a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> and those of a member of the Parliament, and also could be subject to the opinions of the minister to whom they were responsible; this situation would impinge on both the independence of members of the Parliament and the maintenance of a “politically neutral public service”. That neutrality also requires <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> to refrain from “active and public participation in party politics” (para. 14). These reasons apply to a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> who is a permanent teacher, even though (it was accepted) “a teacher is not an instance of the archetypical <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> at whom the disqualification was primarily aimed” (para. 18).|$|R
40|$|The article {{deals with}} the basic {{principles}} of organization and functioning of the institute of the public authorities in Germany. The possibility of the implementation of these principles in Ukraine has been identified. Aspects that include the «public servant» concept have been considered and those categories, which are included into the «public servant» position in similar German institutions, have been described. The procedure of public servants’, appointing to the relevant categories of posts and the legislation on the political impartiality of <b>public</b> <b>servants,</b> has been analyzed. Some disciplinary rules of law, which regulate the consequences that can lead to a particular offense of <b>public</b> <b>servants,</b> have been pointed out. These special public-legal relations both at the federal and state levels are ruled by German laws on <b>public</b> <b>servants.</b> Federal law on <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> (Bundesbeamtengesetz) contains detailed description on the procedure of provision of services by <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> at the federal level. The relevant state laws exists for <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> who are employed in the public service at the state level, for example, in the city or municipality. According to the German state structure, employers of <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> are State, land and municipality. It should be noted that from April, 1 st 2009 the significant changes were made to state laws on <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> and these changes are based on the law on the status of <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> (Beamtenstatusgesetz). The previous law on the status of <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> (Beamtenrechtsrahmengesetz) was canceled. So, <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> are persons, which perform public-legal functions in the public sphere at the federal, state and municipal levels. In Germany <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is a person who is in special official relations with the state. These relations are characterized by the performance of public-legal functions. <b>Public</b> <b>servant’s</b> relations with the State (land) are characterized by the loyalty and the trust from the Government’s side. The <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> has special public-legal powers, based on the relevant principles of public administration. All these aspects have been investigated in comparison with the relevant rules of Ukrainian law «On Public Service». The importance of the unification of basic approaches and principles of development, which are described in the law «On Public Service», with {{the basic principles of}} service in local authorities has been proved.

Hiring procedures for the public service were changed in order to guarantee an independent process and public servants' wages were taken into account to limit extra payments. On 18 October 2011, the Portuguese Minister of Finance, Vítor Gaspar, said to the Portuguese television RTP 1 that the wage cuts imposed to <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> the previous week in the presentation of the State Budget for 2012 were the only way to avoid a much more painful and complex policy of <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> mass firing.

40|$|The article {{analyzes}} {{ethical aspects}} of the personality of a <b>public</b> <b>servant.</b> Such  concepts as, «professional honor», «professional dignity», «professional justice», «professional responsibility» are disclosed. The role of these concepts in public servants’ professional activities is defermined. It is stated that professional dignity of the <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is closely connected with his position in the team, his personal merit and honor <b>public</b> <b>servant.</b> The matter is that a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is a representative a particular team, and the entire public service. The {{attention is focused on}} the fact that the higher developed feeling of personal and official dignity of <b>public</b> <b>servants,</b> the more he values his professional honor, the more significant social value he has to society. As a result, professional honor and professional dignity, complement each other, help to maintain a certain, fairly high level of a <b>public</b> <b>servant’s</b> morality. It was found that such concepts as «professional honor», «professional dignity», «professional justice», «professional responsibility» were brought up before and are brought up now in a large stable structures and organizations of the world. In developed countries, such as France, Germany, Japan, England – the honor and responsibility of <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> are essential professional qualities, which largely determine style of activities and influence decision-making process. In our country, nowadays, the education of a <b>public</b> <b>servant</b> is missed, therefore we will not be able in the future to count on the loyalty of civil servants to their job.

Anticipating this, <b>public</b> <b>servants</b> might tend to reciprocate or blow the whistle upfront.
