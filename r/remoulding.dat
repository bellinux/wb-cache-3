40|$|Unexpected {{swelling}} induced in foundation soils {{can cause}} distress to structures founded on them. In this paper, the swelling of kaolinitic soils due to interaction with alkali solution has been reported. The induced swelling {{is attributed to}} the formation of new minerals, which has been confirmed by X-ray diffraction patters and SEM studies. To understand the effect of alkali concentration and duration of interaction, two series of consolidation experiments have been carried out. In series 1, the specimen were <b>remoulded</b> with water and inundated with alkali solutions and in series 2, the specimen were <b>remoulded</b> and inundated with same alkali solutions. A steep compression during loading cycle and no abnormal swelling during unloading cycle has been noticed for the specimen <b>remoulded</b> with water and inundated with 1 N NaOH solutions. The steep compression is due to the segregation or break down of clay minerals due to alkali interactions. In case of specimen inundated with 4 N NaOH solutions, abnormal swelling has been observed during unloading cycle of the consolidation test. New minerals are formed on interaction of soil with 4 N solution as confirmed by X-ray diffraction patterns. These minerals are known to have very fine pores and possess high water holding capacity. The differences in the amount of swelling of samples <b>remoulded</b> with water and <b>remoulded</b> with alkali solution are due to variations in the concentration of alkali and duration of interaction...|$|R

2500|$|A better aid to dating is {{the quality}} of the clay. Over time their {{consistency}} became coarser, looser, more granular, and also lighter. The ornamental trimmings of the tiles are also useful: because they were the same for whole series of motifs, so one can reconstruct their relationships in the workshops and suggest contemporaneity. Very common motifs like the Ionian cymatium and palmettes are of only limited use, because these were used by a wide variety of workshops, even at the same time. Finally, sixe comparisons can also help with dating. Moulds were not only made from the original punch, but also often from tiles themselves. This leads to a natural [...] "shrinkage" [...] of the new tiles' dimensions. Because the moulds were sometimes reused for long periods of time, there are sometimes noticeable changes {{in the size of the}} tiles. For the motif depicting the Curetes performing a weapon dance around the baby Zeus, the moulds can be traced over a period of 170 years. In the process, the tiles lost about 40% of their size as a result of the repeated reuse of completed tiles as moulds. Therefore, in tiles which share a motif, the smaller can be identified as the younger. The motif also lost clarity through repeated <b>remoulding.</b>|$|E

60|$|Though, after occupying {{themselves}} with primitive arts and products, anthropologists have devoted their attention {{mainly to the}} physical characters of the human races; it must, I think, be admitted {{that the study of}} these yields in importance to the study of their psychical characters. The general conclusions to which the first set of inquiries may lead, cannot so much affect our views respecting the highest classes of phenomena as can the general conclusions to which the second set may lead. A true theory of the human mind vitally concerns us; and systematic comparisons of human minds, differing in their kinds and grades, will help us in forming a true theory. Knowledge of the reciprocal relations between the characters of men and the characters of the societies they form, must influence profoundly our ideas of political arrangements. When the inter-dependence of individual natures and social structures is understood, our conceptions of the changes now taking place, and hereafter to take place, will be rectified. A comprehension of mental development as a process of adaptation to social conditions, which are continually <b>remoulding</b> the mind and are again remoulded by it, will conduce to a salutary consciousness of the remoter effects produced by institutions upon character; and will check the grave mischiefs which ignorant legislation now causes. Lastly, a right theory of mental evolution as exhibited by humanity at large, giving a key, as it does, to the evolution of the individual mind, must help to rationalize our perverse methods of education; and so to raise intellectual power and moral nature.|$|E
60|$|As the Brissago council came {{to realise}} {{that what it}} had {{supposed}} to be temporary camps of refugees were rapidly developing into great towns of a new type, {{and that it was}} <b>remoulding</b> the world in spite of itself, it decided to place this work of redistributing the non-agricultural population {{in the hands of a}} compactor and better qualified special committee. That committee is now, far more than the council of any other of its delegated committees, the active government of the world. Developed from an almost invisible germ of 'town-planning' that came obscurely into existence in Europe or America (the question is still in dispute) somewhere in the closing decades of the nineteenth century, its work, the continual active planning and replanning of the world as a place of human habitation, is now so to speak the collective material activity of the race. The spontaneous, disorderly spreadings and recessions of populations, as aimless and mechanical as the trickling of spilt water, which was the substance of history for endless years, giving rise here to congestions, here to chronic devastating wars, and everywhere to a discomfort and disorderliness that was at its best only picturesque, is at an end. Men spread now, with the whole power of the race to aid them, into every available region of the earth. Their cities are no longer tethered to running water and the proximity of cultivation, their plans are no longer affected by strategic considerations or thoughts of social insecurity. The aeroplane and the nearly costless mobile car have abolished trade routes; a common language and a universal law have abolished a thousand restraining inconveniences, and so an astonishing dispersal of habitations has begun. One may live anywhere. And so it is that our cities now are true social gatherings, each with a character of its own and distinctive interests of its own, and most of them with a common occupation. They lie out in the former deserts, these long wasted sun-baths of the race, they tower amidst eternal snows, they hide in remote islands, and bask on broad lagoons. For a time the whole tendency of mankind was to desert the river valleys in which the race had been cradled for half a million years, but now that the War against Flies has been waged so successfully that this pestilential branch of life is nearly extinct, they are returning thither with a renewed appetite for gardens laced by watercourses, for pleasant living amidst islands and houseboats and bridges, and for nocturnal lanterns reflected by the sea.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} is to characterise along various stress paths the {{microstructural}} evolution of a deep-water marine sediment from the Gulf of Guinea (GoG). Results obtained at the macroscopic level have shown that the phenomenological behaviour of the GoG sediment is explained by the properties of <b>remoulded</b> samples given by the isotropic and critical state lines, and by the properties of the intact samples given by the damage evolution of the inter-aggregate bonds. Microstructural investigations conducted by mercury intrusion porosimetry and scanning electron microscopy demonstrate that the volumetric strains measured at the macroscopic level come from inter-aggregate pore variations associated with the degrading of the inter-aggregate bonds. The mechanism responsible for reorienting the particles appears to apply in the case of the <b>remoulded</b> sediment. As for the natural sediment, it is first necessary to increase the isotropic consolidation stress towards higher values in order to break the bonds between the aggregates before it becomes possible to activate the particle reorientation mechanism and thus approach the <b>remoulded</b> behaviour...|$|R

60|$|The {{biography}} {{of a very}} great man from the pen of a very ladylike writer--this is the best description we can give of M. Caro's Life of George Sand. The late Professor of the Sorbonne could chatter charmingly about culture, and had all the fascinating insincerity of an accomplished phrase-maker; being an extremely superior person {{he had a great}} contempt for Democracy and its doings, but he was always popular with the Duchesses of the Faubourg, as there was nothing in history or in literature that he could not explain away for their edification; having never done anything remarkable he was naturally elected a member of the Academy, and he always remained loyal to the traditions of that thoroughly respectable and thoroughly pretentious institution. In fact, he was just the sort of man who should never have attempted to write a Life of George Sand or to interpret George Sand's genius. He was too feminine to appreciate the grandeur of that large womanly nature, too much of a dilettante to realise the masculine force of that strong and ardent mind. He never gets at the secret of George Sand, and never brings us near to her wonderful personality. He looks on her simply as a litterateur, as a writer of pretty stories of country life and of charming, if somewhat exaggerated, romances. But George Sand was much more than this. Beautiful as are such books as Consuelo and Mauprat, Francois le Champi and La Mare au Diable, yet in none of them is she adequately expressed, by none of them is she adequately revealed. As Mr. Matthew Arnold said, many years ago, 'We do not know George Sand unless we feel the spirit which goes through her work as a whole.' With this spirit, however, M. Caro has no sympathy. Madame Sand's doctrines are antediluvian, he tells us, her philosophy is quite dead and her ideas of social regeneration are Utopian, incoherent and absurd. The best thing for us to do is to forget these silly dreams and to read Teverino and Le Secretaire Intime. Poor M. Caro! This spirit, which he treats with such airy flippancy, is the very leaven of modern life. It is <b>remoulding</b> the world for us and fashioning our age anew. If it is antediluvian, it is so because the deluge is yet to come; if it is Utopian, then Utopia must be added to our geographies. To what curious straits M. Caro is driven by his violent prejudices may be estimated {{by the fact that he}} tries to class George Sand's novels with the old Chansons de geste, the stories of adventure characteristic of primitive literatures; whereas in using fiction as a vehicle of thought, and romance as a means of influencing the social ideals of her age, George Sand was merely carrying out the traditions of Voltaire and Rousseau, of Diderot and of Chateaubriand. The novel, says M. Caro, must be allied either to poetry or to science. That it has found in philosophy one of its strongest allies seems not to have occurred to him. In an English critic such a view might possibly be excusable. Our greatest novelists, such as Fielding, Scott and Thackeray cared little for the philosophy of their age. But coming, as it does, from a French critic, the statement seems to show a strange want of recognition of one of the most important elements of French fiction. Nor, even in the narrow limits that he has imposed upon himself, can M. Caro be said to be a very fortunate or felicitous critic. To take merely one instance out of many, he says nothing of George Sand's delightful treatment of art and the artist's life. And yet how exquisitely does she analyse each separate art and present it to us in its relation to life! In Consuelo she tells us of music; in Horace of authorship; in Le Chateau des Desertes of acting; in Les Maitres Mosaistes of mosaic work; in Le Chateau de Pictordu of portrait painting; and in La Daniella of the painting of landscape. What Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Browning have done for England she did for France. She invented an art literature. It is unnecessary, however, to discuss any of M. Caro's minor failings, for the whole effect of the book, so far as it attempts to portray for us the scope and character of George Sand's genius, is entirely spoiled by the false attitude assumed from the beginning, and though the dictum may seem to many harsh and exclusive, we cannot help feeling that an absolute incapacity for appreciating the spirit of a great writer is no qualification for writing a treatise on the subject.|$|E

Experimental investigation and subsequent analysis involving a number of fine-grained soils of widely varying plasticity and geological origin have led to a two-parameter linear model of the relationship between logarithm of <b>remoulded</b> undrained shear strength and liquidity index. The numerical values of the parameters are found to be dependent to a lesser extent on the soil group and to a greater extent on the soil state. Based on the values of regression coefficient, ranking index and ranking distance, it seems that the relationship represents the experimental results well. It may be pointed out that the possibility of such a relationship in the semi-solid state of a soil has not been explored in the past. It is also shown that the shear strength at the plastic limit is about 32 - 34 times that at the liquid limit...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{seeks to}} improve our {{understanding}} of the concept of critical junctures. Critical junctures have been used to provide avenues for exploring change in historical institutionalism. However, the critical junctures concept, as it has developed, lacks rigour. We have no means of saying, with certainty, what is a critical juncture. If we cannot define a critical juncture the issue of path dependency becomes nebulous, as we cannot be certain as to path origins. Over the years the critical junctures concept has been used in conjunction with “watersheds” in politics, but without any quantifications. This has left the approach in a quandary. Consequently, historical institutionalists have been more inclined to look to other approach to identify change. Improving upon the critical junctures approach involves specifying standards that enable identification of levels of change. The <b>remoulded</b> approach is employed here in examining change in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions’ (ICTU) influence over public policy in 1959. It will identify if this change in the unions’ influence over public policy constituted a critical juncture. This example will illustrate how the <b>remoulded</b> approach reduces uncertainty surrounding the issue of what level of change is necessary to constitute a critical juncture. What is more, the <b>remoulded</b> framework is applicable to any social science research concerned with change...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{utilisation}} of wet cohesive materials as embankment fill. An attempt {{is made to}} formulate a rational approach to assessing the suitability of such materials through standard laboratory and field measurements and tests. Consequently a method of establishing critical moisture content limits of these soils is proposed. The three factors which influence {{the use of such}} fill are traffickability, embankment stability and self-settlement of embankments. Primarily these factors depend on the <b>remoulded</b> undrained shear strength of a soil. The first part of this thesis therefore concentrates on the <b>remoulded</b> properties of cohesive soils and finds that there is a general relationship which summarises the undrained shear strength moisture content behaviour of these soils. It is shown that the principal influence on this behaviour is that of Liquid Limit. In {{the second part of the}} thesis the three primary influences on soils suitability are examined. The restrictions on usage imposed by stability and self-settlement can be determined by calculation, and these are also shown to be related to Liquid Limit. Field observations show that, in a general way, the depth of rut caused by trafficking plant can be related to the <b>remoulded</b> undrained shear strength. Equivalent strengths can therefore be obtained for the observed practical limits of plant operation. Tyre pressures and vehicle size are found to influence these limits. Since the suitability of a cohesive soil is shown to be related to <b>remoulded</b> undrained shear strength, moisture content. Liquid Limit and depth of rutting, it is possible to propose a rational method of assessing, the suitability of such soils in embankment. As a consequence it is shown that the common practice of employing a factor times the Plastic Limit as an earthworks control specification, is inappropriate and highly inaccurate when compared with a Liquid Limit control...|$|R
