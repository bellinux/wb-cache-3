5|$|As {{early as}} 1870, chemists {{thought that there}} should be an alkali metal beyond caesium, with an atomic number of 87. It was then {{referred}} to by the provisional name eka-caesium. <b>Research</b> <b>teams</b> attempted to locate and isolate this missing element, and at least four false claims were made that the element had been found before an authentic discovery was made.|$|E
5|$|Systematic {{screening}} of traditional Chinese medical herbs {{was carried out}} by Chinese <b>research</b> <b>teams,</b> consisting of hundreds of scientists in the 1960s and 1970s.

5|$|Bawdsey, {{right on}} the eastern coast in a {{relatively}} secluded location, could not effectively be protected from air attack or even bombardment from boats offshore. The need to move the team to a more protected location on the opening of hostilities had been identified long before the war. During a visit to his alma mater at Dundee University, Watt approached the rector to ask about potentially basing the team there, on short notice. When the Germans invaded Poland and war was declared on 3 September 1939, the <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> packed up and arrived in Dundee to find the rector only dimly recalling the conversation and having nothing prepared for their arrival. Students and professors had since returned after the summer break, and only two small rooms were available for the entire group.|$|E
5|$|Trained <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> {{were already}} on the ground on Java {{responding}} to the May earthquake and began a {{survey of more than}} one hundred Muslim farmers, plantation laborers, and fishermen (or those with fishing-related occupations) that were affected by the tsunami. Almost two thirds of the group reported that they lived in permanent structures made of wood, brick, or cement, while the remainder lived in semi-permanent facilities made from earth or stone. The government was cited as the first responder for water, relocation and medical assistance, and helping with the deceased. For rescue, shelter, clothing, and locating missing people, individuals were listed as the primary provider, but 100% of those surveyed replied that the government should be responsible for relief. Most of those requiring aid stated that they were given effective assistance within 48 hours and that they were satisfied with the help.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the very}} faint {{luminosity}} of this galaxy, its exact distance was not measured for several years. Well before then, another major breakthrough occurred with the next event registered by BeppoSAX, GRB 970508. This event was localized within four hours of its discovery, allowing <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> to begin making observations much sooner than any previous burst. The spectrum of the object revealed a redshift of z=0.835, placing the burst {{at a distance of}} roughly 6 billionlight years from Earth. This was the first accurate determination of the distance to a GRB, and together with the discovery of the host galaxy of 970228 proved that GRBs occur in extremely distant galaxies. Within a few months, the controversy about the distance scale ended: GRBs were extragalactic events originating within faint galaxies at enormous distances. The following year, GRB 980425 was followed within a day by a bright supernova (SN 1998bw), coincident in location, indicating a clear connection between GRBs and the deaths of very massive stars. This burst provided the first strong clue {{about the nature of the}} systems that produce GRBs.|$|E

The Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network will participate {{as a member of}} the <b>research</b> <b>team</b> under the terms identified below through [Insert Names of Organizational Representatives on Research Team]. The above listed individuals constitute the <b>research</b> <b>team.</b> Additional members may join in signing this PRC and participate as members of the <b>research</b> <b>team</b> once all members (listed above) have agreed. Purpose The purpose of this PRC is to establish a set of principles that guide the conduct of the research projects, [Insert Name of Project]. In short, this agreement acknowledges the importance of incorporating cultural values and perspectives into the research process. Records The Principal Investigator (PI or project coordinator will coordinate all administrative matters relating to the above named research project. The PI or project coordinator will provide each member of the <b>research</b> <b>team</b> with notes of meetings, including decisions made, within a reasonable time frame. Ethical Considerations Ethical codes of conduct for research in Aboriginal communities have been articulated in the Tri-Council Policy Statement. However, each member of the <b>research</b> <b>team</b> collectively shares the responsibility for raising ethical concerns and issues. Ethical dilemmas are resolved on the basis of the <b>research</b> <b>team</b> striving for a significant degree of consensus...|$|R
5|$|Most {{information}} on the social life in Vijayanagara empire comes from the writings of foreign visitors and evidence that <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> in the Vijayanagara area have uncovered. The Hindu caste system was prevalent and rigidly followed, with each caste represented by a local body of elders who represented the community. These elders set {{the rules and regulations}} that were implemented with the help of royal decrees. Untouchability was part of the caste system and these communities were represented by leaders (Kaivadadavaru). The Muslim communities were represented by their own group in coastal Karnataka. The caste system did not, however, prevent distinguished persons from all castes from being promoted to high-ranking cadre in the army and administration. In civil life, by virtue of the caste system, Brahmins enjoyed a high level of respect. With {{the exception of a few}} who took to military careers, most Brahmins concentrated on religious and literary matters. Their separation from material wealth and power made them ideal arbiters in local judicial matters, and their presence in every town and village was a calculated investment made by the nobility and aristocracy to maintain order. However, the popularity of low-caste scholars (such as Molla and Kanakadasa) and their works (including those of Vemana and Sarvajna) is an indication of the degree of social fluidity in the society.|$|E
5|$|Word that Lewis was {{developing}} his own {{solutions to the}} minimum range problem reached the AI team at St Athan some time in early 1940. Bowen was extremely upset. He had become used {{to the way the}} researchers had been put into an ill-advised attempt at production but now Rowe was directly removing them from the research effort as well. Tizard heard of the complaints and visited Dundee in an attempt to smooth them over, which evidently failed. On 29 March 1940 a memo from Watt's DCD office announced a reorganization of the Airborne Group. Gerald Touch would move to the RAE to help develop production, installation and maintenance procedures for the Mk. IV, several other members would disperse to RAF airfields to help train the ground and air crews directly on the units, {{while the rest of the}} team, including Lovell and Hodgkin, would re-join the main radar <b>research</b> <b>teams</b> in Dundee. Bowen was notably left out of the reorganization; his involvement in AI ended. In late July, Bowen was invited to join the Tizard Mission, which left for the US in August 1940.|$|E
