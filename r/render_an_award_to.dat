The arbitral tribunal, seated in Geneva, Switzerland, was composed of three members (Professor Claude Reymond, Sir Owen Woodhouse and Professor Francois Terre) and <b>rendered</b> <b>an</b> <b>award</b> in 1987 in favor of Greenpeace, ordering France to pay it some $8.1 million. David McTaggart, Greenpeace's chairman, described the award as [...] "a great victory for those who support the right of peaceful protest and abhor the use of violence." [...] Greenpeace was represented by Lloyd Cutler and Gary Born of Wilmer Cutler & Pickering.|$|R
40|$|Arbitration is {{a method}} of private, binding and {{enforceable}} dispute resolution. A neutral third party called arbitrator <b>renders</b> <b>an</b> <b>award</b> after hearing testimony and argument from each party. Therefore, the qualification of the arbitrator is important <b>to</b> <b>render</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>award.</b> Under the Arbitration Act 1952, there are circumstances that can cause <b>award</b> <b>to</b> be set aside. The Arbitration Act 1952 had clearly expressed that arbitral award may be set aside when the arbitrator has misconducted himself or the proceedings. However, the Act does not provide any definition {{on the meaning of}} arbitrator?s misconduct. Hence, this research intends to identify the judicial interpretations of arbitrator?s misconduct in arbitration proceedings. This research was carried out mainly through documentary analysis of relevant case reported in law journals. The analysis showed that there were five main judicial interpretations on arbitrator?s misconduct which included breach of the rules of natural justice, failure to consider all matters referred to by the parties, ignored the condition in the contract, bias, and contravention of the rules of evidence. There are many interpretations on arbitrator?s misconduct in arbitration proceedings. Most of the cases interpreted arbitrator?s misconduct more to his wrongful behaviour, action and the way he conduct the proceedings. Therefore, there is absolutely no easy answer. The arbitrator would be wise to remember that they must always conduct the proceeding in a proper manner...|$|R

50|$|Upon the {{submission}} {{of the claim}} for decision, the Mexican and American commissioners disagreed as to its proper disposition, and it was referred to the umpire of the commission, Sir Edward Thornton, then British Ambassador to the US. On 11 November 1875, the umpire <b>rendered</b> <b>an</b> <b>award</b> {{in favor of the}} archbishop and bishops of California. By that award, the value of the funds {{at the time of its}} sale in 1842 was finally fixed at $1,435,033. The annual interest on that sum at 6% (the rate being fixed by the decree of 1842) amounted to $86,101.98 and for the years between 1848 and 1869 totaled $1,808,141.58. The umpire held that of this amount, one-half should equitably be held apportionable to the missions of Upper California, located in American territory, and therefore <b>awarded</b> <b>to</b> the United States for the account of the archbishop and bishops of California $904,070.79. This judgment was paid in gold by Mexico in accordance with the terms of the convention of 1868, in thirteen annual installments.|$|R
