The ground station , {{with large numbers of}} nissen huts and other building erected during World War II and during the 1950s were also all demolished, including the removal of streets and other infrastructure.

Other parts of the base were sold to private agricultural interests, with the exception of some housing units [...] retained by the USAF for families of personnel assigned to RAF Molesworth and a small school. These homes may have been sold by the MoD in recent years, due to the reduced number of American military personnel in the areas. The large J-Type hangar was retained by the 10th TRW at RAF Alconbury for storage of War <b>Reserve</b> <b>Material</b> (WRM) assets until the late 1980s.

In 1954 the Italian and American governments signed a joint use agreement and by 1955, HQ United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) had moved its Italian operations from Udine to Aviano. The base went through a period of hosting rotational fighter squadrons. With the declining use of the Italian live fire range, the rotational squadrons became a thing of the past. Aviano became a war <b>reserve</b> <b>material</b> storage base and played a big part in Desert Storm. In 1992, HQ 16th Air Force and the 401st Fighter Wing moved from Torrejon Air Base, Spain to Aviano. The Wing became home to two F-16 fighter squadrons, the 510th FS and the 555th FS. Both squadrons relocated from Ramstein AB in 1994 and redesignated.

The akinetes and their daughter cells were unable to fix N 2 until the first heterocysts differentiated in the young three-celled filaments after 19 h. The large glycogen reserves of the mature akinetes were not necessary for germination, since fixation of Cot commenced immediately and 70 % of the fixed carbon accumulated as glycogen. Although cyanophycin was degraded after 6 h, this <b>reserve</b> <b>material</b> was subsequently resynthesized with concomitant breakdown of phycocyanin. These nitrogen reserves were not required for protein synthesis, which was initiated immediately after the induction of germination, apparently at the expense of another, non-proteinaceous, <b>reserve</b> <b>material.</b> Although RNA synthesis occurred without lag, DNA synthesis commenced only after 80 min.

40|$|In Podarcis sicula {{specialized}} follicle cells send <b>reserve</b> <b>materials</b> to the previtellogenic oocyte via intercellular bridges. Immediately {{before the}} onset of vitellogenesis this transferring becomes particularly massive so that the cell volume significantly reduces, meanwhile in the nucleus the morphological alterations typical of apoptosis appear. To clarify why these follicle cells are not simply fully resorbed by the oocyte and to determine whether their DNA is discarded or recycled, we carried out a series of morphological and biochemical investigations. The finding that large macromolecular scaffolds are formed and that these are able to retain the DNA until it is extensively cut by two different endonucleases suggests that regression of the follicle cells is programmed and that the fate of their DNA is strictly controlled. Following its genetical neutralization via fragmentation, the DNA is apparently recycled by being transferred into the oocyte via the intercellular bridges, that, in fact, remain open until the very late stages of cell regression. The small DNA fragments reaching the oocyte cytoplasm would not interfere with meiosis completion but could significantly contribute to the stock of <b>reserve</b> <b>materials</b> to the advantage of the growing oocyte and/or developing embryo...|$|R
40|$|A new genus {{and species}} of obligately methylotrophic {{bacteria}} are described. These bacteria are nonmotile, gram-negative rods occurring singly and in pairs. Only methanol and methylamine can support growth. Formaldehyde fixation occurs mainly via the 3 -hexulose phosphate pathway, and cell extracts contain a glutathione-independent, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-linked formaldehyde dehydrogenase. The deoxyribonucleic acid base composition is 54. 1 mol % guanine plus cytosine. Nitrogen-limited cells accumulate over 5 % of their dry weight as a glycogen-like <b>reserve</b> <b>material.</b> This polysaccharide is a homoglucan {{which is similar to}} glycogen in its iodine-staining properties and its degree of degradation by phosphorylase a. Some of the glucose molecules are a- 1, 4 linked, and the presence of other types of bonds in the glucan is implied. The name of the genus proposed for these bacteria is Methylobacillus gen. nov. The name of the type species, Methylobacillus glycogenes sp. nov., refers to the ability of this species to form a glycogen-like <b>reserve</b> <b>material.</b> The type strain of M. glycogenes is T- 11 (= ATCC 29475). Methylotrophy has been defined as the “ability to grow nonautotrophically at the expense of carbon compounds containing one or more carbon atoms but containing no carbon to carbon bonds ” (6). Molecules which contain one or more carbon atoms but no carbon-to-carbon bonds are referred to as one-carbon compounds. This includes molecules like dimethyl ether, dimethylamine, and the more obvious one-carbon compounds such as methane and methanol. Currently, six genera of methylotrophic bacteri...|$|E
