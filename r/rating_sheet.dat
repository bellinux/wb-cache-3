40|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (ISF) {{is a new}} {{promising}} technology due to its flexibility and low-cost tooling properties compared with conventional forming processes. However, it is only suitable for small-batch production because of its incremental feature inducing relative long forming time. Presently, widespread usage of the process is restricted {{by a lack of}} predictive understanding of the process due to its complexity. In this paper, the aspect of forming time is studied by investigating the effects of four distinctive process parameters (step over, feed <b>rate,</b> <b>sheet</b> thickness and tool diameter). An effective analysis tool, Taguchi method together with design of experiment (DOE) and analysis of variance (ANVOA) is utilized to study the effects of the four process parameters on forming time and further to optimize parameter combinations in order to minimize forming time. Using these techniques, experimental results show that the step over of spiral tool path is the most important process parameter affecting forming time followed by feed <b>rate.</b> <b>Sheet</b> thickness and tool diameter have little effect on forming time. The comparison between the prediction of optimized parameter combination and the confirmation test result has further demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

40|$|CONTEXT: Research {{has shown}} that {{individuals}} who have sustained a spinal cord injury can experience strong and abrupt variations in their emotional state; however no instrument for nurses has been developed to assess these patients' psychological status. OBJECTIVE: To develop a brief, reliable instrument to enable nurses to accurately assess, record and respond to spinal cord injury patients' psychological status. METHODS: In Phase 1, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} spinal cord injury patients (n[*]=[*] 10) and nurses (n[*]=[*] 10) which were audio recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed to develop the instrument. The instrument's content validity was then ensured via independent expert review. In Phase 2, the instrument was trialled on 80 spinal cord injury patients to determine inter-rater reliability, internal consistency and test-retest reliability. RESULTS: In Phase 1, four core themes (emotional impact, coping, relationships and assessment) were identified together with a number of related sub-themes. In Phase 2, the instrument was shown to have excellent inter-rater reliability, acceptable internal consistency and satisfactory test re-test reliability. Subsequently a <b>rating</b> <b>sheet,</b> user manual and prompt card were produced.

40|$|Background: The {{treatment}} of recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation {{in patients who}} failed a supervised rehabilitation program is operative stabilization. Anatomical repair addressing the underlying pathology is the preferred method. We hypothesize that Bristow-Latarjet procedure is effective in all types of traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocations, although in cases with Bankart lesion, Bankart operation is certainly preferred. Methods: Thirty-five shoulders on which a Bristow-Latarjet operation had been performed on account of traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder instability were followed up {{for an average of}} 24. 6 months (range: 18 – 51). The clinical outcome was measured according to Walch-Duplay <b>Rating</b> <b>Sheet</b> for Anterior Instability of the Shoulder at the latest follow-up.
