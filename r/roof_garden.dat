25|$|In 1924 Moisés Simons (piano) {{founded a}} group which {{played on the}} <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> of the Plaza Hotel in Havana, and {{consisted}} of piano, violin, two saxes, banjo, double bass, drums and timbales. Its members included Virgilio Diego (violin); Alberto Socarrás (alto sax, flute); José Ramón Betancourt (tenor sax); Pablo O'Farrill (d. bass). In 1928, still at the same venue, Simons hired Julio Cueva, a famous trumpeter, and Enrique Santiesteban, a future media star, as vocalist and drummer. These were top instrumentalists, attracted by top fees of $8 a day.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the appeals}} of the St. Francis was its jazz orchestra, {{led by a}} young {{musician}} named Art Hickman. His band, which in 1914 included Bert Kelly, played in the Rose Room of the hotel, before going on to greater fame at the New York Biltmore Hotel and the <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> of the New Amsterdam Theatre. During his time at the St. Francis, he helped popularize such musicians as Paul Whiteman and Ferde Grofe who, after leaving the St. Francis orchestra, went on to compose the Grand Canyon Suite.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese style <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> {{on top of}} the Brunei Gallery {{was built}} during the Japan 2001 {{celebrations}} and was opened by the sponsor, Haruhisa Handa, an Honorary Fellow of the School, on 13 November 2001. The garden is dedicated to Forgiveness, which is the meaning of the kanji character engraved on the garden's granite water basin. Peter Swift, a designer with experience of adapting Japanese garden design principles to the British environment and climate, conceived the garden as a place of quiet contemplation and meditation as well as a functional space complementary to the gallery and its artistic activities.|$|E

25|$|Fisher wrote {{a letter}} of {{recommendation}} to Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., resulting in Thomas' being hired for the Ziegfeld Follies. However, Thomas later disputed this, claiming she walked right up and asked for the job. She made her stage debut in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1915 on June 21, 1915. Thomas' popularity in the Follies led to her being cast in Ziegfeld's more risqué Midnight Frolic show. The Frolic was staged after hours in the <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> of the New Amsterdam Theatre. It was primarily a show for famous male patrons who had plenty of money to bestow on the young and beautiful female performers. Thomas received expensive gifts from her admirers; it was rumored that German Ambassador Albrecht von Bernstorff {{had given her a}} $10,000 string of pearls.|$|E
25|$|As {{well as the}} {{stations}} and other facilities and attractions already mentioned, in the immediate area {{was one of the}} world’s biggest and most luxurious department stores: Wertheim. Founded by German merchant Georg Wertheim (1857–1939), designed by architect Alfred Messel (1853–1909), opened in 1897 and extended several times over the following 40 years, it ultimately possessed a floor area double that of the Reichstag, a 330-metre-long granite and plate glass facade along Leipziger Straße, 83 elevators, three escalators, 1,000 telephones, 10,000 lamps, five kilometres of pneumatic tubing for moving items from the various departments to the packing area, and a separate entrance directly from the nearby U-Bahn station. It also contained a summer garden, winter garden and <b>roof</b> <b>garden,</b> an enormous restaurant and several smaller eating areas, its own laundry, a theatre and concert booking office, its own bank, whose strongrooms were underground at the eastern end of the building (and generated their own history decades later), and a large fleet of private delivery vehicles. In the run-up to Christmas Wertheim was transformed into a fairytale kingdom, and was well known to children from all over Germany and far beyond.|$|E
25|$|The Columbus Avenue {{site was}} {{originally}} {{known as the}} Bal Tabarin, a nightclub that featured big band music and a multi-act floor show including a line of dancing showgirls. Restaurateur and businessman Bob Grison partnered with popular bandleader Tom Gerun (born Gerunovitch) and Frank Martinelli, manager of a nightclub called the <b>Roof</b> <b>Garden,</b> to establish a nightclub in 1930. In 1931, {{in anticipation of the}} repeal of Prohibition in the United States, architect Timothy L. Pflueger was contracted to create for the nightclub a stage for live music and dance shows, and a comfortable and sophisticated cocktail bar atmosphere—unusual for the day, as most bars were not decorated to appeal to women. The bar itself was implemented in the Moderne style later called Art Deco. The stage design used Pflueger's patented indirect lighting hidden behind curved strips of decorative metal. The color coming from behind the façade could be changed smoothly from one hue to another. Two years later, with alcohol bans officially lifted nationwide, the Bal Tabarin was issued California's first new liquor license, and in 1934 Pflueger gave the nightclub a quick renovation. The popularity of the club netted for Pflueger a series of contracts to design cocktail lounges for prominent hotels in San Francisco.|$|E
50|$|Kensington High Street {{was also}} the site of Biba in the 1960s and early 1970s. When Derry & Toms closed, the iconic store took the {{building}} and accentuated its Art Deco style further. But the 1970s recession, coupled with idealistic business ideas, killed Biba in 1975. The Derry & Toms <b>roof</b> <b>gardens</b> still remain, {{now known as the}} Kensington <b>Roof</b> <b>Gardens</b> and owned since 1981 by Richard Branson's Virgin.|$|R
40|$|As {{we know we}} live in {{a process}} of {{industrialization}} and massive building of residential buildings, both individually and as a collective housing. Given all that happens even with the procedural other things to come up with all this, the country remains less green space that is required for a single environment, so the <b>roof</b> <b>gardens</b> are the best choice for all of this to get a beautiful country. For <b>roof</b> <b>gardens</b> should be given the explanation that, <b>roof</b> <b>gardens,</b> call it beautiful, flat roofs, and with gentle slope, with rich composition intensively maintained and often impose a constructive adaptation of the building and benefits by the architectural beauty, insulation, absorption. Commonly found in urban areas and almost always are placed foliage with not very high growth. ...|$|R

500|$|On the hotel's {{top floor}} was the roof-garden, {{enclosed}} {{on all sides}} by glass, with a glass roof over. It was furnished with rattan chairs and lounges in pale-green and pink, hung across with gauzy fabric. On the roof on the 34th Street side was the grand promenade, , on solid footing high in the air, with a band stand, fountains, and trellises of columns. The <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> restaurant occupied a space , and was roofed in. The ceiling was [...] high. At the northeast and northwest corners of the <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> were towers, with spiral stairways within, {{leading up to the}} copper covered roofs of the pavilions, which were [...] above the sidewalk. The palm gardens, used as cafes, rose to a height of two and three stories respectively and were roofed-over with domes of tinted glass. Balconies at the various floor levels opened on to these courts to overlook them. The materials used were cream-colored brick and terracotta, and were Italian Renaissance in style.|$|E
500|$|Colmesnil {{left the}} firm some time around 1913, leaving Miller to conduct {{business}} as [...] "J. R. Miller". Subsequently, Pflueger was assigned by Miller {{to work closely}} with the firm's major client, Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who engaged in a succession of expansion projects at their San Francisco location at 600 Stockton Street. The first expansion, completed in 1914, gave the building a <b>roof</b> <b>garden,</b> dining room, kitchen and subbasement.|$|E
500|$|The {{building}} committee carefully considered {{what they wanted}} in a new library and presented their ideas to Kahn in an unusually detailed document that went through more than fifty drafts. [...] The early designs included some items that were eventually rejected, such as a <b>roof</b> <b>garden</b> and two exterior towers with stairs that were open to the weather. [...] They {{were removed from the}} plans when the {{building committee}} reminded Kahn that neither of those features would be practical in New England winters.|$|E
50|$|The <b>roof</b> <b>gardens</b> are edged by {{elevated}} flowerbeds in {{the shape}} of planter railings, designed to block the view to neighbouring, lower-level apartments.
