Current Energy Star guidelines for computers call for a power factor of ≥ 0.9 at 100% of <b>rated</b> <b>output</b> in the PC's power supply.

25|$|Airflows {{can be used}} to run {{wind turbines}}. Modern {{utility-scale}} wind turbines range from around 600kW to 5 MW of rated power, although turbines with <b>rated</b> <b>output</b> of 1.5–3 MW have become the most common for commercial use. The largest generator capacity of a single installed onshore wind turbine reached 7.5 MW in 2015. The power available from the wind {{is a function of the}} cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine. Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms. Typically full load hours of wind turbines vary between 16 and 57 percent annually, but might be higher in particularly favorable offshore sites.|$|E

Further, the uncertainty of exchange <b>rate</b> and <b>output</b> is associated positively with the uncertainty of all shocks while the contemporaneous occurrence of selected shocks imposes either a positive or negative impact on exchange <b>rate</b> and <b>output</b> volatility.
