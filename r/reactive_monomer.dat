In this demonstration, we have selected an application which has a significant commercial potential, the use of textiles to deliver antimicrobial activity. The methods of attachment and the general considerations should be similar for delivery of: catalysts in chemical synthesis, reactants to remove pollutants from air or water, and for producing materials with biocompatibility. The work has demonstrated the following methods for incorporating reactive chemicals in textile materials: 1. Mechanistically understood chemical modification of the surface of fibers by the simple addition of <b>reactive</b> <b>monomers</b> to a <b>reactive</b> fiber. 2. Mechanistically understood creation of sites on an unreactive fiber, followed by chemical addition of <b>reactive</b> <b>monomers.</b> 3.

50|$|Cationic {{polymerization}} {{is a type}} {{of chain}} growth polymerization in which a cationic initiator transfers charge to a monomer which then becomes reactive. This <b>reactive</b> <b>monomer</b> goes on to react similarly with other monomers to form a polymer. The types of monomers necessary for cationic polymerization are limited to olefins with electron-donating substituents and heterocycles. Similar to anionic polymerization reactions, cationic polymerization reactions are very sensitive to the type of solvent used. Specifically, the ability of a solvent to form free ions will dictate the reactivity of the propagating cationic chain.Cationic polymerization is used in the production of polyisobutylene (used in inner tubes) and poly(N-vinylcarbazole) (PVK).|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of a nitroxide-mediated {{polymerization}} reaction, the persistent radical is the nitroxide species and the transient radical is always the carbon radical. This leads to repeated coupling of the nitroxide to the growing end of the polymer chain, which would ordinarily be considered a termination step, but is in this case reversible. Because of the high rate of coupling of the nitroxide to the growing chain end, there is little coupling of two active growing chains, which would be an irreversible terminating step limiting the chain length. The nitroxide binds and unbinds to the growing chain, protecting it from termination steps. This ensures that any available monomer can be easily scavenged by active chains. Because this polymerization process does not naturally self-terminate, this polymerization process is described as “living,” as the chains continue to grow under suitable reaction conditions whenever there is <b>reactive</b> <b>monomer</b> to “feed” them. Because of the PRE, it can be assumed that at any given time, almost all of the growing chains are “capped” by a mediating nitroxide, meaning that they dissociate and grow at very similar rates, creating a largely uniform chain length and structure.|$|E

40|$|In {{the course}} of the PhD thesis {{reactive}} homogeneous fluoropolymers have been synthesized employing free radical continuous addition polymerization technique. Classical free radical „batch copolymerization”, is done when solvent, initiator and monomers are mixed together and heated under inert conditions until almost full conversion of the monomer has been achieved. The procedure results in messy products or simply a blend of copolymers with different monomeric compositions. The most <b>reactive</b> <b>monomer</b> reacts faster e. g. incorporates into the macromolecule, but less <b>reactive</b> <b>monomer</b> accumulates in the reaction mixture leading to the copolymers enriched in less <b>reactive</b> <b>monomer.</b> The issue of continuous addition polymerization is that the consumed monomers must continuously be replaced by dispensing of monomer feed solution in {{the course of}} polymerization, generating a homogeneous copolymers. Modification of the fluoropolymers was done in order to get solubility in water, ethanol or their mixtures, UV and thermally corosslinkcable functionalities and develop water born, super hydrophobic/oleophobic formulations based on the reactive fluoropolymers together with different sizes silica nanopatricles and their combinations. For this purpose, the silica nanoparticles of different sizes have been obtained as well and characterized by TEM, SEM and DLS. The nano composite superhydrophobic/oleophobic coatings from environmentally friendly solvents (water, ethanol, and their mixtures) were formed on different substrates like glass, plastics, aluminum, paper, ceramics, and textile using spin coating, electro spraying, padding and dip coating techniques.

40|$|Colloidal {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals or {{quantum dots}} (QDs) {{are a very}} interesting class of nanomaterials since their properties can be tuned by their size due to quantum confinement. QDs are typically produced via a hot injection synthesis (HIS), which involves the injection of precursors in a hot mixture of a non-coordinating solvent and coordinating ligands such as carboxylic acids, thiols or phosphonic acids. For QDs to be implemented in {{a broad range of}} applications, a precise control over their size is essential. As a result, recent developments in the hot injection synthesis focus on producing QDs with predefined sizes, sharp size distributions and high reaction yields.
