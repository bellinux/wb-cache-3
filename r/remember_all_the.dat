25|$|In 2008 {{expectations}} were high that Waterford would retain their Munster title and {{challenge for the}} All-Ireland once again. After a disappointing National League campaign and a nine-point loss to Clare {{in the first round}} of the championship a players meeting was held where it was indicated that some of the team no longer wanted McCarthy in charge. From that another meeting with the County Board was held where McCarthy resigned as manager. McCarthy had a successful reign over Waterford and most will <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> great games that he was involved in but will also remember the fact that Waterford never reached an All-Ireland final under him.|$|E

[...] Having fallen into bankruptcy many times before, Little was a particularly sensitive debtor, and would often waive the debts held to him by others who fell on hard times; thus it came to be that, by the time of his death, Little was owed millions of dollars by others, of which only 150,000 was successfully collected by his friends and family, a modest sum given the size of his former wealth.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "In much the same way, young German boys and girls in 1941 were mesmerized by Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, in which Adolf Hitler was depicted as a newborn God. Both JFK and Triumph of the Will are equally a propaganda masterpiece and equally a hoax.

500|$|Wiesenthal {{worked for}} the American Office of Strategic Services for a year, and {{continued}} to collect information on both victims and perpetrators of the Holocaust. He assisted the Berihah, an underground organisation that smuggled Jewish survivors into the British Mandate for Palestine. Wiesenthal helped arrange for forged papers, food supplies, transportation, and so on. In February 1947, he and 30 other volunteers founded the Jewish Documentation Center in Linz to gather information for future war crimes trials. They collected 3,289 depositions from concentration camp survivors still living in Europe. However, as the US and the Soviet Union lost interest in conducting further trials, a similar group headed by Tuviah Friedman in Vienna closed its office in 1952, and Wiesenthal's closed in 1954. Almost all of the documentation collected at both centres was forwarded to the Yad Vashem archives in Israel. Wiesenthal, employed full-time by two Jewish welfare agencies, continued his work with refugees. As {{it became clear that}} the former Allies were no longer interested in pursuing the work of bringing Nazi war criminals to justice, Wiesenthal persisted, believing the survivors were obligated to take on the task.

2500|$|The lord of Aratta, {{in a fit}} of pride, refuses {{and instead}} asks Enmerkar to deliver to him these {{precious}} stones himself. Upon hearing this, Enmerkar spends ten years preparing an ornate sceptre, then sends it to Aratta with his messenger. This frightens the lord of Aratta, who now sees that Inanna has indeed forsaken him, but he instead proposes to arrange a one-on-one combat between two champions of the two cities, to determine the outcome of the still-diplomatic conflict with Enmerkar. The king of Uruk responds by accepting this challenge, while increasing his demands for the people of Aratta to make a significant offering for the E-ana and the abzu, or face destruction and dispersal. To relieve the herald who, beleaguered, can no longer <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> messages with which he is charged, Enmerkar then resorts to an invention: writing on tablets. The herald again traverses the [...] "seven mountains" [...] to Aratta, with the tablets, and when the king of Aratta tries to read the message, Ishkur, the storm-god, causes a great rain to produce wild wheat and chickpeas that are then brought to the king. Seeing this, the king declares that Inanna has not forsaken the primacy of Aratta after all, and summons his champion.|$|E
2500|$|The Bible {{does not}} command wearing {{of a unique}} prayer shawl or tallit. Instead, it presumes that people wore a garment of some type to cover {{themselves}} and instructs the Children of Israel to attach fringes ( [...] tzitzit) to the corners of these (Numbers 15:38), repeating the commandment in terms that they should [...] "make thee twisted cords upon {{the four corners of}} thy covering, wherewith thou coverest thyself" [...] (Deuteronomy 22:12). These passages do not specify tying particular types or numbers of knots in the fringes. The exact customs regarding the tying of the tzitzit and the format of the tallit are of post-biblical, rabbinic origin and, though the Talmud discusses these matters, slightly different traditions have developed in different communities. However the Bible is specific as to the purpose of these tzitzit, stating that [...] "it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray; that ye may remember and do all My commandments, and be holy unto your God" [...] (...)

2500|$|On January 29, 2010, as Original Productions' crews shot footage for season 6 of the Cornelia Marie {{offloading}} C. opilio crab at St. Paul Island, Captain Phil Harris, who {{had earlier}} complained of being excessively tired, {{went to his}} stateroom to retrieve pain medicines and collapsed. Second-year Engineer Steve Ward discovered {{him on the floor}} of his stateroom, conscious but unable to move his left leg or his left hand. Ward immediately got Phil's sons Josh and Jake to come to his stateroom while he called for paramedics. According to Thom Beers, producer and creator of Deadliest Catch, Harris insisted that the camera crews continue to film him. [...] "We want to remember Phil as who he was," [...] Beers told Zap2it.com writer Kate O'Hare. [...] "We want to <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> dynamics, {{but at the same time}} the guy was insistent when we were doing this, saying, 'Dude, you've got to.

[...] Beers said he honored Harris' wishes and continued to shoot as Harris was airlifted to Anchorage, Alaska, where doctors performed emergency brain surgery to relieve the pressure building up in the cranial vault and avoid further brain damage. Harris spent eleven days in ICU before succumbing to complications from his stroke on February 9, 2010.|$|E
2500|$|Maimonides {{taught that}} a garment {{to which the}} Torah obligates a person to attach tzitzit must have three characteristics: (1) it must have four or more corners; (2) it must {{be large enough to}} cover both the head and most of the body of a child who is able to walk on his own in the {{marketplace}} without having someone watch him; and (3) it must be made of either wool or linen. For a garment of wool, the white strands should be made of wool. For a garment of linen, the white strands should be made of linen. For garments of other fabrics, the white strands should be made from the same fabric as the garment. [...] which says, [...] "And you shall see them," [...] implies that the obligation to wear tzitzit applies during the day, but not at night. Nevertheless, a blind man is obligated to wear tzitzit, for even though he does not see them, others see him wearing them. One is permitted to wear tzitzit at night, provided he does not recite a blessing. One should recite the blessing over tzitzit in the morning when the sun has risen so that one can tell the strands of techelet from those that are white. The blessing is: [...] "Blessed are you, God, our Lord, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to wrap ourselves with tzitzit." [...] One should recite the blessing anytime he wraps himself in tzitzit during the day. Maimonides taught that the Torah does not require women and children to wear tzitzit, but the Rabbis oblige every boy who knows how to dress himself to wear tzitzit so as to teach him to fulfill commandments. Women who wish to wrap themselves in tzitzit may do so without reciting a blessing, and no one should prevent them. Maimonides taught that there is no obligation to attach tzitzit to a garment that remains folded in place, without a person wearing it. The garment does not require tzitzit. Rather, the person wearing the garment has the obligation. Maimonides taught that even though a person is not obligated to buy a tallit and wrap himself in it so that he must attach tzitzit to it, it is not proper for a person to release himself from the commandment. He should always try to be wrapped in a garment that requires tzitzit so as to fulfill the commandment. In particular, Maimonides taught that one should take care to be wrapped in a tallit during prayer, and it is very shameful for a Torah scholar to pray without being wrapped in a tallit. And Maimonides taught that a person should always be careful regarding the commandment of tzitzit, because [...] which says [...] "And you shall see them and <b>remember</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> commandments of God," [...] implies that the commandment of tzitzit is considered equal to all the commandments and all the commandments are considered dependent on it.|$|E
