50|$|A {{variation}} of the <b>Romberg</b> <b>Test,</b> the Sharpened <b>Romberg</b> <b>Test,</b> consists of narrowing the patient’s base of support by placing feet in a heel to toe position.

The patient should be instructed to keep hands on hips for the whole 30 seconds.

40|$|Abstract The Romberg sign helps {{demonstrate}} loss of postural {{control as}} a result of severely compromised proprioception. There is still no standard approach to applying the <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> in clinical neurology and the criteria for and interpretation of an abnormal result con-tinue to be debated. The value of this sign and its adapta-tion when walking was evaluated. Detailed clinical examination of 50 consecutive patients of cervical mye-lopathy was performed prospectively. For the walking Romberg sign, patients were asked to walk 5 m with their eyes open. This was repeated with their eyes closed. Swaying, feeling of instability or inability to complete the walk with eyes closed was interpreted as a positive walking Romberg sign. This test was compared to common clinical signs to evaluate its relevance. Whilst the Hoffman’s reflex (79 %) was the most prevalent sign seen, the walking Romberg sign was actually present in 74. 5 % of the cases. The traditional <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> was positive in 17 cases and 16 of these had the walking Romberg positive as well. Another 21 patients had a positive walking <b>Romberg</b> <b>test.</b> Though not statistically significant, the mean 30 m walking times were slower in patients with traditional <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> than in those with positive walking <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> and fastest in those with neither of these tests positive. The combination of either Hoffman’s reflex and/or walking Romberg was positive in 96 % of patients. The walking Romberg sign is more useful than the traditional <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> as it shows evidence of a proprioceptive gait deficit in significantly more patients with cervical myelopathy than is found on conventional neurological examination. The combination of Hoffman’s reflex and walking Romberg sign has a potential as useful screening tests to detect clinically significant cervical myelopathy...|$|E

40|$|CONTEXT: An {{estimated}} 300   000 sport-related concussion injuries {{occur in}} the United States annually. Approximately 30 % of individuals with concussions experience balance disturbances. Common methods of balance assessment include the Clinical Test of Sensory Organization and Balance (CTSIB), the Sensory Organization Test (SOT), the Balance Error Scoring System (BESS), and the Romberg test; however, the National Collegiate Athletic Association recommended the Wii Fit as an alternative measure of balance in athletes with a concussion. A central concern regarding {{the implementation of the}} Wii Fit is whether it is reliable and valid for measuring balance disturbance in athletes with concussion. OBJECTIVE: To examine the reliability and validity evidence for the CTSIB, SOT, BESS, <b>Romberg</b> <b>test,</b> and Wii Fit for detecting balance disturbance in athletes with a concussion. DATA SOURCES: Literature considered for review included publications with reliability and validity data for the assessments of balance (CTSIB, SOT, BESS, <b>Romberg</b> <b>test,</b> and Wii Fit) from PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. DATA EXTRACTION: We identified 63 relevant articles for consideration in the review. Of the 63 articles, 28 were considered appropriate for inclusion and 35 were excluded. DATA SYNTHESIS: No current reliability or validity information supports the use of the CTSIB, SOT, <b>Romberg</b> <b>test,</b> or Wii Fit for balance assessment in athletes with a concussion. The BESS demonstrated moderate to high reliability (interclass correlation coefficient = 0. 87) and low to moderate validity (sensitivity = 34 %, specificity = 87 %). However, the <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> and Wii Fit {{have been shown to be}} reliable tools in the assessment of balance in Parkinson patients. CONCLUSIONS: The BESS can evaluate balance problems after a concussion. However, it lacks the ability to detect balance problems after the third day of recovery. Further investigation is needed to establish the use of the CTSIB, SOT, <b>Romberg</b> <b>test,</b> and Wii Fit for assessing balance in athletes with concussion...|$|E
40|$|Background: Balance {{disorders}} is a {{major cause}} which often lead elders to fall easily. Body balance reduction of elders can be helped by many variety of balance exercises, {{one of them is}} elders exercise. There have been many researches on the assessment of body balance. But a research carrying a <b>Romberg</b> <b>Test</b> to assesses static balance by closing and opening eyes as a visual organ has not been done. This study aims to determine the effect of exercise on elderly body balance which measured by <b>Romberg</b> <b>Test.</b> Design and Method: Analytic observational research with cross-sectional approach was conducted to elderly who routinely do exercises and to them who donâ€™t. There were 82 samples, consisted of 41 elderly do exercises and 42 elderly who donâ€™t. Body balances of both groups were measured using the <b>Romberg</b> <b>test.</b> The data were analyzed by chi-square. Result: Among the 41 elderly who do exercise, consisted of 12 men and 29 women, showed 97. 56 % balanced and 2. 44 % unbalanced. While 41 elderly aged over 60 years who donâ€™t do exercise, consisted of 15 men and 26 women, showed 46. 34 % balanced and 53. 66 % unbalanced.

The study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effect of 6 months of endurance training of moderate intensity on physical performance {{and the risk of}} falling in haemodialysis patients. Material and methods. This was a prospective interventional study in which 21 of 35 eligible patients accepted to participate. The 6 -minute walk test (6 MWT), timed up and go (TUG), timed stand <b>test</b> and <b>Romberg's</b> <b>test</b> were used to evaluate physical fitness. The Borg scale was used to control the workload. The patients bicycled for 12 - 40 min with increasing workload according to their capabilities. Wilcoxon signed ranks and McNemar's tests were used for analysis. Results. Of the 21 participants, 12 completed 3 months of training. Their median (range) age was 69 (37 - 88) years, duration of dialysis was 2. 5 (1 - 11) years and body mass index was 25. 0 (20. 0 - 31. 9). <b>Romberg's</b> <b>test</b> was positive in four participants at the beginning but in three after 3 months. Nine participants completed 6 months of training; none had a positive <b>Romberg's</b> <b>test</b> at that time. Walking distance increased significantly after 3 and 6 months of training (p = 0. 002 and p = 0. 012, respectively), and time for the TUG decreased significantly (p = 0. 041 and p = 0. 044), as did time for the timed stand test (p = 0. 015 and 0. 018), compared with baseline values. The TUG test was in excess of 14 s in four patients at baseline but only one at the end of training. Conclusion.

40|$|Purpose This study aims at verifying whether {{proprioception}} is abnormal or not, {{two weeks}} after a grade 1 and 2 ankle sprain in the scope of work-related accident. Methods A descriptive, observation and transversal {{study was designed to}} compare speed, movement and oscilation of centre of pressure in employees of companies signed up to a mutual company. Participants’ healthy feet comprised the control group, and feet that had undergone an ankle sprain due to a work-related accident comprised the cases group. The following stability tests were undertaken to both the healthy and injuried feet using a force plate: Monopodal <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> with eyes open, Monopodal <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> with eyes open on a 30 mm thick foam rubber, Monopodal <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> with eyes closed, and <b>Romberg</b> <b>test</b> as monopodal support with eyes closed on a 30 mm thick foam rubber. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed. From the results of this regression model the COR curve test was performed. Results 71. 7 % accuracy in the predictions was attained. The equation was as follows: Condition (injured or healthy) = 0. 052 ⋅% RGC AP Movement −  0. 81 ⋅MREO AP Movement. The variable MREO antero-posterior movement was used in the COR curve methodology. The area under the curve was greater than 0. 65 and at a 95 % confidence interval the 0. 75 value was included, which in our case was the injured subject condition.

40|$|Several {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} a negative influence of benzodiazepines on driving skills. The objective {{of this study is}} to study the relationship between the blood concentration of benzodiazepines and the influence on performance in field sobriety tests. A retrospective case file evaluation was conducted to select cases of drivers, tested positive for benzodiazepines only in the period from January 1999 to December 2004. Drivers were grouped into the categories sub therapeutic, therapeutic or elevated concentrations. The outcome of the tests (walking, walking after turn, nystagmus, <b>Romberg's</b> <b>test,</b> behavior, pupils and orientation) was binomial. A Chi square test was used to assess differences in proportions of the categorized cases. In total 171 cases were included.

40|$|Background: Even though {{inertial}} {{measurement units}} (IMU) {{are already being}} used experimentally for evaluating movements of segment of the axial skeleton, no studies have been found which have used IMUs to measure {{the behavior of the}} segments of upper limbs during quiet stance. Objective: The objective is to design a suitable application of IMUs to measure movements of the upper extremities in <b>Romberg's</b> <b>test</b> and analyze spontaneous arm movements. Second aim is to identify possible discrepancies between the dominant and non-dominant arm movements. Methods: The dominant and non-dominant upper limb of each participant was identified. Then, the movements of both upper limbs were measured by the Xsens system equipped with MTx motion trackers during the quiet stance on a firm surface with eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC). The measured data was used to calculate the medians and maximums of the superior-inferior, medio-lateral and anterior-posterior acceleration. Also, tremor intensity was calculated to quantitatively evaluate the measured data. Results: The comparison of values of maximal accelerations of the dominant and non-dominant arms showed significant difference between the arms during EC conditions. The comparison of values of median accelerations of the dominant and non-dominant arms showed significant differences between the acceleration of arms in medio-lateral direction during EO and EC conditions. In all cases, values of maximal and median accelerations and values of tremor intensity of the dominant limb strongly correlated with values on the non-dominant limb.
