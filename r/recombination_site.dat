These genes are embedded in a specific genetic structure called gene cassette (a term that is lately changing to integron cassette) that generally carries one promoterless ORF together with a <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> (attC). Integron cassettes are incorporated to the attI site of the integron platform by site-specific recombination reactions mediated by the integrase.|$|E

EcoRI fragments of the P1 Bacteriophage genome were generated and cloned into lambda vectors. A 6.5kb EcoRI fragment (Fragment 7) was found to permit efficient recombination events. The mechanism of these recombination events {{was known to be}} unique as they occurred in the absence of bacterial RecA and RecBCD proteins. The components of this recombination system were elucidated using deletion mutagenesis studies. These studies showed that a P1gene product and a <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> were both required for efficient recombination events to occur. The P1 gene product was named Cre (Causes Recombination) and the <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> was named loxP (locus of crossing (x) over, P1). The Cre protein was purified in 1983 and was found to be a 35,000 Da protein. No high energy cofactors such as ATP or accessory proteins are required for the recombinase activity of the purified protein. [...] Early studies also demonstrated that Cre binds to non specific DNA sequences whilst having a 20 fold higher affinity for loxP sequences and results of early DNA footprinting studies also suggested that Cre molecules bind loxP sites as dimers.|$|E
50|$|A gene {{cassette}} {{is a type}} of mobile genetic element that contains a gene and a <b>recombination</b> <b>site.</b> Each cassette usually only contains a single gene these genetic elements and tend to be very small; on the order of 500-1000 base pairs. They may exist incorporated into an integron or freely as circular DNA. Gene cassettes can move around within an organism genome or be transferred to another organism in the environment via horizontal gene transfer. These cassettes often carry antibiotic resistance genes. An example would be the kanMX cassette which confers kanamycin (an antibiotic) resistance upon bacteria.|$|E

50|$|P1 phage {{had been}} {{discovered}} in 1951, but was little understood when Sternberg began to research the virus. He discovered the Cre-lox site-specific recombination system, in which the Cre recombinase enzyme acts at the lox <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> to allow P1's double-stranded DNA genome to circularise after infection. Sternberg, Brian Sauer and others in his group subsequently showed that Cre-lox is a flexible recombination system which also functions in eukaryotic cells, {{and it is now}} widely used in genetic engineering. Sternberg elucidated multiple other features of the phage and its life cycle, including lytic and lysogenic replication cyles, DNA methylation and viral packaging, as well as immunity to the phage. He and his coworkers also developed P1-derived cloning vectors, enabling the cloning of very long stretches of DNA, which have been used in mapping the human genome.|$|E
5000|$|At recombination, two {{directly}} repeated res {{sites with}} resolvase dimers bound to each sub-site, {{come together to}} form a large complex structure called the synaptosome. Resolvase bound to sites II and III initiates the assembly of this complex. In this structure, exact architecture of which is still unclear, two res sites are intertwined {{in such a way as}} to juxtapose two copies of site I, allowing resolvase dimers bound to each site to form a tetramer. Again, it is the interaction between the resolvase dimers bound at accessory sites (sites II and III) and resolvase at site I that causes the two dimers to synapse and form a tetramer. After the tetramer is formed it becomes activated and the top and bottom DNA strands are simultaneously cleaved in the middle of the site I with a 2bp overhang. The strand exchange ensues by as yet unknown mechanism with a resulting net rotation of 180°. The strand exchange is then followed by the religation (Stark et al., 1992).Recombination between two directly repeated res sites separates, or resolves, the “cointegrate” into two original molecules, each one now containing a copy of the Tn3 transposon. After resolution these two molecules remain linked as a simple two-noded catenane which can be easily separated in vivo by a type II topoisomerase (Grindley 2002). Wild type resolvase system absolutely requires a supercoiled substrate and that the recombination sites are oriented in a direct repeat on the same DNA molecule. However, a number of “deregulated” or “hyperactive” mutants that have lost the requirement for the accessory sites have been isolated. These mutants are capable of catalysing recombination between two copies of site I only, which basically reduces the <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> size from 114bp to only 28bp. [...] Furthermore, these mutants have no supercoiling or connectivity requirements (Arnold et al., 1999) and have been shown to work in mammalian cells. Hyperactive resolvase mutants have so far proven useful in creating resolvases with altered sequence specificity [...] but also in structural work.|$|E

For this purpose, the backcross (BC) progenies of two diploid (2 n = 2 x = 24) interspecific hybrids of lily, viz. Longiflorum × Asiatic (LA) and Oriental × Asiatic (OA), were used. Mostly the BC progenies of LA hybrids consisted of both triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and diploid (2 n = 2 x = 24) with some aneuploid genotypes {{and those of}} OA hybrids consisted of triploid (2 n = 3 x = 36) and some aneuploid genotypes. In all cases, {{it was possible to}} identify the homoeologous recombinant chromosomes as well as accurately count the number of crossover points, which are called ¿recombination sites¿. <b>Recombination</b> <b>sites</b> were estimated in the BC progeny of 71 LA and 41 OA genotypes. In the case of BC progenies of LA hybrids, 248 <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> were cytologically localized on 12 different chromosomes of each genome (i. e., L and A). Similarly, 116 recombinant sites were localized on the 12 chromosomes each from the BC progenies of OA hybrids (O and A genomes). Cytological maps were constructed {{on the basis of the}} percentages of distances (micrometres) of the <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> from the centromeres. Since an Asiatic parent was involved in both hybrids, viz. LA and OA, two maps were constructed for the A genome that were indicated as Asiatic (L) and Asiatic (O). The other two maps were Longiflorum (A) and Oriental (A). Remarkably, the <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> were highly unevenly distributed among the different chromosomes of all four maps. Because the <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> can be unequivocally identified through GISH, they serve as reliable landmarks and pave the way for assigning molecular markers or desirable genes to chromosomes of Lilium and also monitor introgression of alien segment...|$|R
40|$|A {{recombination}} map of {{the genome}} of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) was assembled using data from 19 complete genomic sequences, previously reported, and a composite sample of three regions of the genome, one-third in total, of a representative Asia-wide collection of 70 isolates. Thus, a total of 89 isolates of worldwide origin was analysed for recombinants. Eighteen <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> were found spaced throughout the 59 two-thirds of the genome, but {{there were only two}} in the 39 one-third; thus, 24 and 35 % of the P 1 and NIa-VPg gene sequences examined were recombinants, whereas only 1 % of the corresponding NIa-Pro and CP gene sequenceswere recombinants. Recombinants with parents from the same or fromdifferent lineages were found, and some <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> characterized particular lineages. Most of the strain BR recombinants belonged to the Asian-BR group, as defined previously, and it was concluded that this lineage resulted from a recent migration, whereas many of the strain B recombinants from Asia fell into the world-B group. Again, a large proportion of isolates in this group were recombinants. Some <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> were found only in particular lineages, and hence seemed more likely to be the surviving progeny from single recombinational events, rather than the progeny of multiple events occurring at recombination hotspots.

40|$|AbstractBackground: Hin is {{a member}} of an {{extended}} family of site-specific recombinases – the DNA invertase/resolvase family – that catalyze inversion or deletion of DNA. DNA inversion by Hin occurs between two <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> and requires the regulatory protein Fis, which associates with a cis-acting recombinational enhancer sequence. Hin recombinase dimers bind to the two <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> and assemble onto the Fis-bound enhancer to generate an invertasome structure, at which time they become competent to catalyze DNA cleavage and strand exchange. In this report, we investigate the role of the Hin dimer interface in the activation of its catalytic functions. Results We show that the Hin dimer is formed at an interface that contains putative amphipathic α-helices {{in a manner that is}} very similar to γδresolvase. Certain detergents weakened cooperative interactions between the subunits of the Hin dimer and dramatically increased the rate of the first chemical step of the reaction –double-strand cleavage events at the center of the <b>recombination</b> <b>sites.</b> Amino-acid substitutions within the dimer interface led to profound changes in the catalytic properties of the recombinase. Nearly all mutations strongly affected the ability of the dimer to cleave DNA and most abolished DNA strand exchange in vitro. Some amino-acid substitutions altered the concerted nature of the DNA cleavage events within both <b>recombination</b> <b>sites,</b> and two mutations resulted in cleavage activity that was independent of Fis activation in vitro. Disulfide-linked Hin dimers were catalytically inactive; however, subsequent to the addition of the Fis-bound enhancer sequence, catalytic activity was no longer affected by the presence of oxidizing agents. Conclusion The combined results demonstrate that the Hin dimer interface is of critical importance for the activation of catalysis and imply that interactions with the Fis-bound enhancer may trigger a conformational adjustment within the region that is important for concerted DNA cleavage within both <b>recombination</b> <b>sites,</b> and possibly for the subsequent exchange of DNA strands...|$|R
40|$|Cre {{recombinase}} from bacteriophage P 1 recognizes a 34 -bp <b>recombination</b> <b>site,</b> loxP, with exquisite sequence specificity and catalyzes the site-specific insertion, excision, or rearrangement of DNA. To {{better understand}} the molecular basis of protein–DNA recognition and generate recombinases with altered specificities, we have developed a directed evolution strategy {{that can be used}} to identify recombinases that recognize variant loxP sites. To be selected, members of a library of Cre variants produced by targeted random mutagenesis must rapidly catalyze recombination, in vivo, between two variant loxP sites that are located on a reporter plasmid. Recombination results in an altered pattern of fluorescent protein expression that can be identified by flow cytometry. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting can be used either to screen positively for recombinase variants that recognize a novel loxP site, or negatively for variants that cannot recognize the wild-type loxP site. The use of positive screening alone resulted in a relaxation of <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> specificity, whereas a combination of positive and negative screening resulted in a switching of specificity. One of the identified recombinases selectively recombines a novel <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> and operates at a rate identical to that of wild-type Cre. Analysis of the sequences of the resulting Cre variants provides insight into the evolution of these altered specificities. This and other systems should contribute to our understanding of protein–DNA recognition and may eventually be used to evolve custom-tailored recombinases that can be used for gene study and inactivation...|$|E

40|$|Integrons play a {{major role}} in the {{dissemination}} of antibiotic resistance genes among Gram-negative pathogens. Integron gene cassettes form circular intermediates carrying a <b>recombination</b> <b>site,</b> attC, and insert into an integron platform at a second site, attI, in a reaction catalyzed by an integron-specific integrase IntI. The IntI 1 integron integrase preferentially binds to the ‘bottom strand' of single-stranded attC. We have addressed the insertion mechanism in vivo using a recombination assay exploiting plasmid conjugation to exclusively deliver either the top or bottom strand of different integrase recombination substrates. Recombination of a single-stranded attC site with an attI site was 1000 -fold higher for one strand than for the other. Conversely, following conjugative transfer of either attI strand, recombination with attC is highly unfavorable. These results and those obtained using mutations within a putative attC stem-and-loop strongly support a novel integron cassette insertion model in which the single bottom attC strand adopts a folded structure generating a double strand <b>recombination</b> <b>site.</b> Thus, recombination would insert a single strand cassette, which must be subsequently processed...|$|E

Methods and Results: Three PVs isolates were found as tripartite recombinants, S 3 /S 2 /S 1 in the 2 C genomic viral region. The first <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> S 3 /S 2 was located close to the 5 ' end of 2 C while the second <b>recombination</b> <b>site</b> S 2 /S 1 was located towards the 3 ' end of 2 C. Such recombination is a rare event producing a tripartite hybrid 2 C protein. Three more PVs isolates were characterized as bipartite S 2 /S 1 recombinants and one as S 2 /S 3 bipartite recombinant. Conclusions: Detection of recombinant circulating vaccine-derived PVs (cVDPVs) is crucial, since increased transmissibility over that of the parental Sabin strains has been proposed {{to be the result of}} recombination events. Significance and Impact of the Study: Importation of recombinant cVDPVs evolved derivatives pose a serious threat to public health and environmental surveillance should be implemented during and after PVs eradication...|$|E
40|$|The Hin DNA {{invertase}} {{promotes a}} site-specific DNA recombination reac-tion in the Salmonella chromosome. The native Hin reaction exhibits over-whelming selectivity for promoting inversions between appropriately oriented <b>recombination</b> <b>sites</b> and requires the Fis regulatory protein, a recombinational enhancer, and a supercoiled DNA substrate. Here, we report a robust recombination reaction employing oligonucleotide sub-strates and a hyperactive mutant form of Hin. Synaptic complex inter-mediates purified by gel electrophoresis {{were found to}} contain four Hin protomers bound to two <b>recombination</b> <b>sites.</b> Each Hin protomer is asso-ciated covalently with a cleaved DNA end. The cleaved complexes can be ligated into both parental and recombinant orientations at equivalent frequencies, provided the core residues can base-pair, and are readily dis-assembled into separated DNA fragments bound by Hin dimers. Kinetic analyses reveal that synapsis occurs rapidly, followed by comparatively slow Hin-catalyzed DNA cleavage. Subsequent steps of the reaction, including DNA exchange and ligation, are fast. Thus, post-synaptic step(s) required for DNA cleavage limit the overall rate of the recombina-tion reaction...|$|R
50|$|<b>Recombination</b> <b>sites</b> are {{typically}} between 30 and 200 nucleotides {{in length and}} consist of two motifs with a partial inverted-repeat symmetry, to which the recombinase binds, and which flank a central crossover sequence at which the recombination takes place. The pairs of sites between which the recombination occurs are usually identical, but there are exceptions (e.g. attP and attB of λ integrase, see lambda phage).|$|R
40|$|A {{comparison}} of the bipolar Ni-H 2 battery with other energy systems {{to be used in}} future high-power space systems is presented. The initial design for the battery under the NASA-sponsored program is described and the candidate stack components are evaluated, including electrodes, separator, electrolyte reservoir plate, and <b>recombination</b> <b>sites.</b> The compressibility of the cell elements, electrolyte activation, and thermal design are discussed. Manufacturing and prototype test results are summarized...|$|R
