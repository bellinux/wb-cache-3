40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{would like to}} show the {{importance}} of the concept of <b>responsibility</b> as the foundation of ethics in times of crisis in particular in the fields of politics and economics in the modern civilisation marked by globalization and technological progres. I consider the concept of <b>responsibility</b> as the key notion {{in order to understand the}} ethical duty in a modern technological civilisation. We can indeed observe a moralization of the concept of <b>responsibility</b> going beyond a strict legal definition in terms of imputability. The paper begins by discussing the humanistic foundations of such a concept of <b>responsibility.</b> It treats the historical origins of <b>responsibility</b> and it relates this concept to the concept of accountability. On the basis of this historical determination of the concept I would like to present the definition of the concept of <b>responsibility</b> as fundamental ethical principle that has increasing importance as the foundation of the principles of governance in modern welfare states. In this context the paper discusses the extension of the concept of <b>responsibility</b> towards institutional or corporate <b>responsibility</b> where <b>responsibility</b> does not only concerns the <b>responsibility</b> of individuals but also deals with the <b>responsibility</b> of institutional collectivities.
