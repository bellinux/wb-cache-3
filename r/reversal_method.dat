40|$|We have {{discovered}} a simple and highly robust method for re-moval of chemical shift artifact in spin-echo MR images, which simultaneously decreases the radiofrequency power deposition (specific absorption rate). The method is demon-strated in spin-echo echo-planar imaging brain images acquired at 7 T, with complete suppression of scalp fat signal. When excitation and refocusing pulses are sufficiently differ-ent in duration, and thus also different in the amplitude of their slice-select gradients, a spatial mismatch is produced between the fat slices excited and refocused, with no overlap. Because no additional radiofrequency pulse is used to sup-press fat, the specific absorption rate is significantly reduced compared with conventional approaches. This enables greater volume coverage per unit time, well suited for functional and diffusion studies using spin-echo echo-planar imaging. More-over, the method can be generally applied to any sequence involving slice-selective excitation {{and at least one}} slice-selective refocusing pulse at high magnetic field strengths.

In this paper, we analyze the effect of inhomogeneity generated by multiple scat-tering among point scatterers under a multistatic sensing setup. We derive the Cramér–Rao bounds (CRBs) on parameters of the scatterers and compare the CRBs for multiple scattering using the Foldy–Lax model with the reference case without multiple scattering using the Born approximation. We find that multiple scattering could significantly improve the estimation performance {{of the system and}} higher order scattering components actually contain much richer information about the scatterers. For the case where multiple scattering is not possible, e. g., where only a single target scatterer exists in the illuminated scenario, we propose the use of artificial scatterers, which could effectively improve the estimation performance of the target despite a decrease in the degrees of freedom of the estimation problem due to the intro-duced unknown parameters of the artificial scatterers. Numerical examples demonstrate the advantages of the artificial scatterers.

We establish a stability analysis and show that, with our choices of the adjoint operator, the iterative methods can achieve a linear rate of convergence, in the $L^ 2 $-norm {{as well as in}} the $H^ 1 $-norm.

A typical time reversal experiment requires that a transmitter be initially present at the target focusing point, which limits the application of this technique. In this paper, we propose a method to focus waves at an arbitary location inside a complex enclosure using a numerically calculated wave excitation signal. We use a semi-classical ray algorithm to calculate the signal that would be received at a transceiver port resulting from the injection of a short pulse at the desired target location. The time-reversed version of this signal is then injected into the transceiver port and an approximate reconstruction of the short pulse is created at the target. The quaility of the pulse reconstruction is quantified in three different ways and the values of these metrics are predicted by the statistics of the scattering-parameter $|S_{ 21 }|^ 2 $ between the transceiver and target points in the enclosure.
