40|$|Background: The Member States of European Union are {{encouraged}} to improve the general conditions for the production and marketing of apicultural products. In Belgium, programmes on the <b>restocking</b> <b>of</b> honey bee <b>hives</b> have run for many years. Overall, the success ratio of this queen breeding programme has been only around 50 %. To tackle this low efficacy, we organized sanitary controls of the breeding queens in 2012 and 2014. Results: We found a high quantity of viruses, with more than 75 % of the egg samples being infected {{with at least one}} virus. The most abundant viruses were Deformed Wing Virus and Sacbrood Virus (>= 40 %), although Lake Sinai Virus and Acute Bee Paralysis Virus were also occasionally detected (between 10 - 30 %). In addition, Aphid Lethal Paralysis Virus strain Brookings, Black Queen Cell Virus, Chronic Bee Paralysis Virus and Varroa destructor Macula-like Virus occurred at very low prevalences (<= 5 %). Remarkably, we found Apis mellifera carnica bees to be less infected with Deformed Wing Virus than Buckfast bees (p < 0. 01), and also found them to have a lower average total number of infecting viruses (p < 0. 001). This is a significant finding, given that Deformed Wing Virus has earlier been shown to be a contributory factor to winter mortality and Colony Collapse Disorder. Moreover, negative-strand detection of Sacbrood Virus in eggs was demonstrated for the first time. Conclusions: High pathogen loads were observed in this sanitary control program. We documented for the first time vertical transmission of some viruses, as well as significant differences between two honey bee races in being affected by Deformed Wing Virus. Nevertheless, we could not demonstrate a correlation between the presence of viruses and queen breeding efficacies...|$|R

However, {{little is known about}} bee behavior and number <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> required. The aims of this study were to compare bees visiting flowers in crop areas with different number <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> (0, 1, 2, and 3), and to evaluate which is the best number. Flowers were observed (n= 78) from 5 am to 6 pm, for five consecutive days, in four experimental areas (0. 5 ha each). Comparisons were made for male (MF) and hermaphrodite (HF) flowers, number <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> and fruit production. The HF were always more visited than MF. Most comparisons made for three hives presented significant differences, since visits increased drastically, competition among bees for floral resources became stronger and reduced the production of commercial fruit (93. 4 %). On the other hand, the highest percentage of commercial fruit was obtained (99 %) with two hives, setting the ideal number <b>of</b> <b>hives</b> as four hives ha- 1. 201...|$|R
