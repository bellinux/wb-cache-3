40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the factors among Marriage and Family Therapy doctoral students associated with the implementation and use of the scientist-practitioner model. Empirical investigation of these factors had not been done in the field of Marriage and Family Therapy. Based on literature reviewed in psychology and a social cognitive theory of career development, a path analysis model was hypothesized that described the relationships between the research training environment, <b>research</b> self-efficacy, <b>and</b> <b>research</b> interest, which were thought to affect two desired outcomes of the scientist-practitioner model of training—research productivity and interest in research-related career goals. Students 2 ̆ 7 gender and year in program were also examined in subsequent models. Results revealed that <b>research</b> productivity <b>and</b> research-related career goals could be explained by these variables but in a different way than originally hypothesized. The use of a multiple group model based on gender along with the addition of the students 2 ̆ 7 year in their program provided the best fit to the data. Significant gender differences were found across all factors along with meaningful relationships between the factors of interest. For males, significant and positive relationships were found for <b>research</b> interest <b>and</b> <b>research</b> self-efficacy, <b>research</b> interest <b>and</b> research-related career goals, <b>research</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>research</b> productivity, <b>and</b> research-related career goals <b>and</b> <b>research</b> productivity. For females, significant and positive relationships were found for the <b>research</b> training environment <b>and</b> <b>research</b> self-efficacy, <b>research</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>research</b> interest, <b>research</b> self-efficacy <b>and</b> <b>research</b> productivity, <b>and</b> <b>research</b> interest <b>and</b> research-related career goals. Year in program was also significantly related to research self-efficacy for females. A significant and negative relationship was found for the <b>research</b> training environment <b>and</b> <b>research</b> interest for females. Implications for training programs, issues for future studies, strengths and limitations were discussed. ...|$|R
