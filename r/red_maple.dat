5|$|<b>Red</b> <b>maple</b> is {{also used}} for the {{production}} of maple syrup, though the hard maples Acer saccharum (sugar maple) and Acer nigrum (black maple) are more commonly utilized. One study compared the sap and syrup from the sugar maple with those of the <b>red</b> <b>maple,</b> {{as well as those of}} the Acer saccharinum (silver maple), Acer negundo (boxelder), and Acer platanoides (Norway maple), and all were found to be equal in sweetness, flavor, and quality. However, the buds of <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> and other soft maples emerge much earlier in the spring than the sugar maple, and after sprouting chemical makeup of the sap changes, imparting an undesirable flavor to the syrup. This being the case, <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> can only be tapped for syrup before the buds emerge, making the season very short.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> is a {{used as a}} {{food source}} by several forms of wildlife. Elk and white-tailed deer in {{particular}} use the current season's growth of <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> as {{an important source of}} winter food. Several Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) utilize the leaves as food; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on maples.|$|E

50|$|Devils Backbone {{offers a}} variety of {{recreational}} activities for visitors. In the spring season, dogwood, redbud, and serviceberry trees are flowering in full force. Then, in fall the foliage of the oaks, sassafras, and <b>red</b> <b>maples</b> begin to turn a vast array of reds, yellows, and oranges.|$|R
5|$|In {{several other}} locations, {{the tree is}} absent from large areas but still present in a few {{specific}} habitats. An example is the Bluegrass region of Kentucky, where <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> is {{not found in the}} dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|<b>Red</b> <b>maple</b> is {{far more}} {{abundant}} today than when Europeans first arrived in North America, where along with its cousin Silver Maple, it may have comprised a mere 5% of forest area and was confined mostly to riparian zones. The density of the tree {{in many of these}} areas has increased 6 to 7 fold and this trend seems to be continuing, much of it due to human factors, especially suppression of wildfires which would kill shallow-rooted pioneer species like <b>red</b> <b>maple,</b> but leave mainline forest trees like oaks and hickories untouched.|$|E
5|$|The <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of moist and dry biomes, from dry ridges and sunny, southwest-facing slopes to peat bogs and swamps. While many types of tree prefer a south or north facing aspect, the <b>red</b> <b>maple</b> {{does not appear to have}} a preference. Its ideal {{conditions}} are in moderately well-drained, moist sites at low or intermediate elevations. However, it is nonetheless common in mountainous areas on relatively dry ridges, as well as on both the south and west sides of upper slopes. Furthermore, it is common in swampy areas, along the banks of slow moving streams, as well as on poorly drained flats and depressions. In northern Michigan and New England, the tree is found on the tops of ridges, sandy or rocky upland and otherwise dry soils, as well as in nearly pure stands on moist soils and the edges of swamps. In the far south of its range, it is almost exclusively associated with swamps. Additionally, <b>Red</b> <b>maple</b> is one of the most drought-tolerant species of maple in the Carolinas.|$|E

5|$|Due to A. rubrums {{very wide}} range, there is {{significant}} variation in hardiness, size, form, time of flushing, onset of dormancy, and other traits. Generally speaking, individuals from the north flush the earliest, have the most reddish fall color, set their buds the earliest and take the least winter injury. Seedlings are tallest in the north-central and east-central part of the range. In Florida, at the extreme south of the <b>red</b> <b>maple's</b> range, it is limited exclusively to swamplands. The fruits also vary geographically with northern individuals in areas with brief, frost-free periods producing fruits that are shorter and heavier than their southern counterparts. As {{a result of the}} variation there is much genetic potential for breeding programs with a goal of producing <b>red</b> <b>maples</b> for cultivation. This is especially useful for making urban cultivars that require resistance from verticillium wilt, air pollution, and drought.|$|R
