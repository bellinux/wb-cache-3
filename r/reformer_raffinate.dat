40|$|The {{effect of}} {{thiophene}} on the kinetics and selectivity of {{the conversion of}} hydrocarbons by steam cracking was studied in a stainless steel tubular reactor with relatively large inner surface. Heptane was selected as a model and decomposed at 700 OC and 100 kPa with a mass ratio of steam to feed of 3 :l. The rate of decomposition increased about 14 % if 0. 1 and 0. 5 % mass of thiophene was added, but was unchanged if 1 % was present. The influence of thiophene on the selectivity of the conversion of heptane to ethene appeared {{to depend on the}} residence time. The effect of thiophene on the formation of coke was investigated in the pyrolysis of a <b>reformer</b> <b>raffinate</b> in a stainless steel flow reactor at 820 OC, without steam. Coking is lessened with increasing amounts of thiophene in the feed (0. 05 - 0. 5 % mass). Reaction mechanisms are suggested...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of aromatic sulfides on the kinetics and selectivity of hydrocarbon conversion by steam cracking and on pyrolytic coke formation {{was investigated in}} stainless steel tubular reactors with relatively large inner surface. The rate of decomposition of heptane (at 700 â€˜C, 100 kPa, and a mass ratio of steam to feed 3 :l) increased by 16 to 26 %, and the selectivity toward ethene decreased, if 0. 1 to 1. O % mass of dibenzyl sulfide, relative to heptane, was added. Addiiion of 1 % mass dibenzyl disulfide increased the decomposition rate of heptane by 8 %. Increasing amounts of the title compounds (0. 1, 0. 5 % mass) in the feed decreased coking up to 70 % in the pyrolysis of <b>reformer</b> <b>raffinate</b> at 820 OC, without steam. The decreased coking in turn caused an increased aromatic content in the liquid pyrolysis product mixtures. Based on the analytical results, obtained by capillary gas chromatography- mass spectrometry, reaction mechanisms are suggested...|$|E
