METHODS The effectiveness of an insect <b>repellent</b> <b>spray</b> containing both DEET and EBAAP was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled field study. The study, requiring simple application of the repellent to exposed skin, was carried out on 276 forestry workers and orienteers under everyday conditions in Switzerland from May to September 1999. We measured total effectiveness of the repellent by the following formula: percentage effectiveness = 100 x (T(P) - T(R)) /T(P), where T(P) and T(R) were the average number of ticks per hour spent in wooded areas for the repellent and placebo groups, respectively. RESULTS The average number of tick bites per hour of exposure to wooded areas differed significantly between the placebo (n = 138) and repellent (n = 138) groups, 0. 17 vs 0. 10 (P <. 05). Total repellent effectiveness against tick attachment was 41. 1 % (95 % CI, 2. 5 - 79. 6). On the arms, an effectiveness of 66 % (95 % CI, 17. 3 - 114. 7) was observed.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Saponins are a {{class of}} {{secondary}} plant metabolites consisting of a sugar moiety glycosidically linked to a hydrophobic aglycone (sapogenin) that often possess insecticidal activities. Four saponins were selected: two triterpene saponins, Q. saponaria saponins and aescin, and two steroidal saponins, digitonin and diosgenin. Their effects were investigated on an important pest species and a model piercing-sucking insect, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum. The triterpene Q. saponaria saponins bark saponin received special attention because of its high activity. Aphids were challenged by oral and contact exposure to demonstrate aphicidal activities, and in choice experiments to support use as a natural deterrent. RESULTS: When aphids were exposed to supplemented artificial diet for 3 days, a strong aphicidal activity was recorded for {{three of the four}} saponins, with an LC 50 of 0. 55 mg mL(- 1) for Q. saponaria saponins, 0. 62 mg mL(- 1) for aescin and 0. 45 mg mL(- 1) for digitonin. The LT 50 values ranged between 1 and 4 days, depending on the dose. For diosgenin, only low toxicity (14 %) was scored for concentrations up to 5 mg mL(- 1). In choice experiments with treated diet, a deterrence index of 0. 97 was scored for Q. saponaria saponins at 1 mg mL(- 1). In contrast, direct contact showed no <b>repellent</b> effect. <b>Spraying</b> of faba bean plants with Q. saponaria saponins resulted in an LC 50 of 8. 2 mg mL(- 1). Finally, histological analysis in aphids fed with Q. saponaria saponins demonstrated strong aberrations of the aphid gut epithelium, and exposure of midgut CF- 203 cell lines to Q. saponaria saponins in vitro confirmed the cytotoxic effect. CONCLUSIONS: The present insect experiments provide strong evidence that saponins, as tested here with triterpene Q. saponaria saponins, can be useful as natural aphicides and deterrents. Furthermore, the insect midgut epithelium is suggested to be a primary target of saponin activity...|$|R

30|$|The {{toxicity}} of waterproofing sprays {{is thought to}} be due to their content of water-repellents, such as fluoropolymers and silicon polymers, or of the solvent in which they are delivered (Picard et al. 2010). Among different repelling agents, fluoropolymers have been the most studied with regard to their toxicity following inhalation (Hays and Spiller 2014). An animal study in mice demonstrated that inhalation of fluoropolymers resulted in pulmonary collapse and pneumonia, probably by counteracting the surfactant action in the alveoli of the lung, whereas mice exposed to non-fluoropolymer-containing products showed less severe injury (Yamashita and Tanaka 1995). These findings suggest that the fluoropolymer water <b>repellents</b> in waterproofing <b>sprays</b> are responsible for causing the acute respiratory illness following inhalation. The primary structural changes after inhalation of waterproofing sprays in animals include alveolar type I cell necrosis and alveolar type II cell necrosis, with resultant impairment of surfactant secretion, direct counteraction of surfactant action, alveolar atelectasis and hemorrhage (Hays and Spiller 2014). A recent study reported developing an isolated perfused rat lung model to examine the potential of surface tension-active substances in waterproofing sprays to cause pulmonary collapse (Fischer et al. 2012). Other mechanisms of the {{toxicity of}} waterproofing sprays include an indirect and complex mechanism requiring metabolic activation with or without interaction with other factors, such as solvents (e.g., n-heptane, hexane and petroleum distillates) and smoking (Hays and Spiller 2014). The mist particle size and the emission rate have also been shown to influence the toxicity of waterproofing sprays (Hays and Spiller 2014; Yamashita et al. 1997).|$|R

40|$|The {{red-billed quelea}} {{is the most}} {{abundant}} bird in the world, with 1. 5 million breeding pairs. They live in massive flocks in central Africa and cause significant damage to cereal crops, especially sorghum. The chemical compound methyl anthranilate (MA), a volatile produced in the leaves of sorghum, has been proven {{to be an effective}} bird repellent. While there are currently commercial MA spray treatments available for sorghum, they have to be applied frequently and are thus not cost effective for smallholder farmers. This work aims to produce a line of sorghum that produces the MA compound in its inflorescence, specifically during early seed development, to decrease bird predation. To produce MA in the seed head of sorghum, we have fused a sorghum anthranilate methyl transferase (AMT) gene (which encodes the enzyme that produces MA) to each of three candidate promoter sequences. Each one of these promoters signals gene expression in different stages of early seed development. Using these promoters, and the isolated AMT, constructs have been created that will be transformed into sorghum. Once these plants are generated, and {{in the early stages of}} growth, the concentration of headspace volatiles around the inflorescence will be analyzed by dynamic headspace sampling coupled with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to determine if the levels of MA are adequate to repel birds.

40|$|Insecticide treated {{mosquito}} bed nets, insecticide aerosol <b>sprays,</b> <b>repellent</b> lotions and creams, repellent candles, vaporizable repellent essential oils, mosquito {{mats and}} coils {{are some of}} the many malaria personal protection tools that are in use. The latter of these measures are the most accessible and affordable options for the rural population in sub-Saharan Africa. It is therefore important to determine how effective these personal protection measures are by determining their ability to efficiently disperse an active ingredient when the protection measure is in use. In this study, a copper II oxide montmorillonite clay burner (CuOMontmorillonite clay burner) was created to vaporize repellent formulations containing various concentrations of p-menthane- 3, 8 -diol (PMD) as the active ingredient with the aim of determining the percentage of the active ingredient that is released into the air and the rate of release. The performance of the CuO-Montmorillonite clay burner was also compared to that of the Lampe Berger fragrance burner (LBFB). In addition to this, the percentage of PMD released from 6 percentage wt PMD candles of diameters 40 mm, 69 mm and 83 mm was determined and compared to that released when the CuO-Montmorillonite clay burner and Lampe Berger Fragrance burner where used to vaporize PMD repellent formulations. It was found that the rate of vaporization of the various PMD repellent formulations vaporized using the Lampe Berger fragrance burner is affected by the mass of PMD present in the repellent formulations. The 6 percentage wt PMD repellent candles released the least percentage of PMD as compared to that released when the CuO-Montmorillonite clay burner and the Lampe Berger fragrance burner were used to vaporize the PMD repellent formulation...|$|R
40|$|Malaria {{remains one}} of the major {{contributors}} to the global burden of disease with approximately 70 % of the clinical malaria attacks occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. Sub- Saharan Africa has the highest risk as ideal climatic conditions for transmission coincide with occurrence {{of some of the most}} efficient malaria vectors, namely Anopheles gambiae s. s., Anopheles arabiensis and Anopheles funestus [...] Even though it is estimated that by the year 2030 more than 50 % of the African population will live in towns and cities, relatively little is known about urban malaria epidemiology, larval ecology and adult mosquito behaviour. Although integrated malaria control programs including environmental management and larviciding have proven successful before the Global Eradication Campaign started in 1955, they were neglected after the invention of DDT. Lately interest into these control measures has revived but it remains to be determined whether they are feasible and cost-effective in urban Africa. The overall goal of the research presented in this thesis was to enhance current understanding of urban malaria epidemiology and ecology and to take an in-depth look at the effectiveness of larviciding with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bti) in the context of the Urban Malaria Control Program (UMCP) in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. Our findings are based on data derived from the first 3 years of the UMCP, where data collection started in March 2004. The project area includes 5 wards in each of the 3 municipalities which consist of 67 mitaa covering an area of 55 km 2 in which 611, 871 people lived during the population census of 2002. Achieving the UMCPs objectives fundamentally relies on three component activities: 1) Mapping and surveillance of potential Anopheles breeding sites, 2) Monitoring of adult mosquito densities, and 3) Household surveys with questionnaires and blood smears testing for malaria parasite infection. In the third year of the UMCP, beginning in March 2006, the routine application of the microbial larvicides Bti in open habitats and Bs in closed habitats was initiated in 3 of the 15 wards in the study area, adding to existing interventions such as bednets, house screening, ceiling boards, <b>repellents,</b> <b>spray</b> and coils. At the same time a detailed survey of mosquito biting behaviour, human behaviour and domestic protection measures was conducted in 12 Ten Cell Units (TCU), the smallest subunit of local government in Tanzania, which presented the highest An. gambiae s. l. densities during the early period of the UMCP surveillance system. Human landing catch (HLC) was conducted in 216 houses on an hourly basis indoors and outdoors from 6 pm till 7 am and residents were interviewed about their sleeping behaviour, where they spend their evenings and what kind of preventive measures against malaria they use. Personal protection of an insecticide treated net (ITN) was evaluated using an extension of a recently developed mathematical model. Overall An. gambiae s. l. exhibited a classical hourly biting pattern. In contrast one of the complex’s component sibling species, namely An. arabiensis, had an early biting peak before 10 pm. Both sibling species, namely An. gambiae s. s. and An. arabiensis, as well as An. funestus and An. coustani were highly exophagic. This behaviour led to a reduced personal protection against exposure to An. gambiae s. s. by ITNs which conferred 59 % reduction of exposure in Dar es Salaam compared to 70 % in rural Tanzania. An. arabiensis is a vector of only modest importance in Dar es Salaam which is fortunate because ITNs only conferred 38 % protection against exposure to this species of mosquito. ITNs conferred slightly less protection against exposure to malaria vectors in good quality houses. This is mainly because people living in good houses tend to spend more time indoors before they go to bed. An. gambiae s. l. is the most important vector in Dar es Salaam, responsible for an EIR (entomological inoculation rate) of 1. 00 infectious bites per person per year whereas An. funestus has an EIR of 0. 13. Surprisingly, An. coustani also acts as a notable vector in Dar es Salaam with an EIR of 0. 20 infectious bites per person per year. Malaria transmission is seasonal with two peaks of malaria prevalence during and after the two rainy seasons. Malaria prevalence was only related to EIR in children under 5 years of age, with a classical ageprevalence distribution similar to most of rural Africa. Malaria prevalence steadily declined from 2004 onwards as the use of window screenings, ceiling boards and more effective drugs like amodiaquine and artemisin-based drugs increased. ITNs (prevalence reduction estimate 20 %, 95 % CI 0 %- 36 %; P= 0. 060; year 1) and ceiling boards (prevalence reduction estimate 22 %, 95 % CI 3 %- 38 %; P= 0. 026; year 2) conferred modest personal protection and reduced malaria prevalence by approximately one fifth. By comparison, a much greater reduction (prevalence reduction estimate 50 %, 95 % CI 20 %- 64 %; P= 0. 002) of malaria prevalence was achieved by larviciding with Bti. This was mainly achieved through major reductions of An. gambiae during July and August when most of the sporozoite infected mosquitoes were caught, combined with all-year-round suppression of the secondary vectors, namely An. funestus and An. coustani. This major achievement was only possible through the novel surveillance and staff management procedures developed by the UMCP to enable effective community based implementation in a decentralized manner. Standards of the surveillance improved greatly after the onset of the program with realized reaction times to vector surveillance at observations being one day, week and month at ward, municipality and city level, respectively. These results of changing biting behaviour of the main malaria vectors in urban settings and the therefore lower but still useful personal protection offered by ITNs call for additional complementary vector control methods such as environmental management or larviciding. The UMCP demonstrated that major reductions in malaria prevalence can be achieved through routine application of microbial larvicides with its new practical management and surveillance system. As these represent the early results of the program, we expect substantial improvement with time and investment. Here we demonstrated for the first time since before the Global Eradication Campaign era, a success story of a malaria control program integrating larviciding, which could be easily adapted by other African cities as a cost-effective option for malaria prevention...|$|R

These recent mixes does not repulse the mosquitoes yet permit them to reach with the fabric and aggravate or killing them before they {{figure out how to}} bolster. The application of anti-agents to dress and different fabrics is desirable over skin application {{on the grounds that it}} diminishes the probability of hypersensitive responses. Former USSR have been developed a vest that claimed as anti-mosquito garment which consist of long sleeves made from wide mesh materials with 0.5  cm fibres thick (Rozendaal 1997). Study by Shannon identifies that garment piece with defensive pieces of clothing adjusted to be worn by outdoorsmen give protection against mosquitoes and different arthropods without any repellent treatment on the fabric. The garment comprises the multilayer of fabric consist of outer and inner layers which are connected at the seams (Shannon 1988). The upholsteries and outdoor textile items as listed on the Table  1 are existing products that have been developed to be used as individual outdoorsmen, housewife and also family. Most of protective mosquito textiles were treated using DEET or Permethrin by <b>spraying</b> the <b>repellents</b> from a pressurized can or by dipping it in the aqueous emulsion. For the netting jackets head nets, the materials are made from a blend of polyester/cotton, which being treated with DEET for easy absorption of the mosquito agent. The disadvantage of the netting jacket is that the structure of the jacket which is made of a wide mesh can be easily entangled. Another limitation is the netting materials must be wrapped in a plastic bag when not in use. Another example of mosquito repellent associated with fabric is the detachable patches with Velcro strips, press buttons or adhesive sticker. The treated patches can be easily removed and do not have a direct contact with the skin, therefore provides safety protection against mosquito Hammocks are made from textile materials for resting and sleeping, especially in jungle areas by outdoormens. It will be hung onto the tree or anything that is tall enough to keep off the ground from soil, crawling insect, snake, scorpions and anything small insects. However, hammock does not protect users from the flying insect such as mosquitoes. Mosquitoes often attack hammock user from the lower part of the hammock where the body presses the textile. There are a few suggestions to make hammock more protective against mosquito. Application of <b>repellent</b> such as <b>spraying</b> to the lower part of the hammock may avoid the mosquito to get near. A more economical method which requires a less repellent agent is by attaching the netting materials such as a piece of cloth which has been treated with repellent agent at the lower part of the hammock. This method can provide partial protection from biting mosquitoes. Another way for long lasting protection is to impregnate the whole hammock with the repellent. Another protective mosquito textiles are mosquito nets. The traditional netting materials are made from raffia (palm fibre), linen or hemp compared to the modern net which made from cotton and man-made fibre such as nylon, polyester or polyethylene. The mesh size of mosquito nets is between 1.2 and 1.5  mm, (if more that 2  mm most mosquitoes can enter). The structure of the netting materials can be woven or knitted. In terms of colour, white color is more preferred as mosquitoes that entered the nett can be easily noticed compared to a darker colour netting. For more protection, the mosquito net {{can be treated}} with mosquito repellent agent during the production as it can act as physical barrier to the entry of the mosquitoes (Rozendaal 1997).|$|R
40|$|Summary Whitefly is {{an insect}} pest that has {{systematically}} spread into colder latitudes {{for the past}} two decades and it poses a serious threat to crops, mainly due to the viruses for which it acts as a vector. As the application of synthetic pesticides is often less effective due to development of resistance or restricted by crop- and country-specific regulations, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies to combat insect pests become attractive. In this thesis, I discuss the potential of the use of secondary metabolites, particularly sesquiterpenoids, of plant origin, both as <b>sprayed</b> <b>repellents</b> or antifeedants and as part of host plant resistance against whitefly. In Chapter 1, I give {{a detailed description of the}} silverleaf whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, its ecology and its effect on crop yield, taking both direct and indirect damage (caused by the viruses the insect transmits) into account. This chapter also provides a detailed account of pest management strategies, both traditional and emergent, with their advantages and disadvantages. The chapter introduces the reader to plant secondary metabolites, and specifically terpenes, discussing their role in plant ecology and their potential as pest management tools with a low environmental impact. Finally, a short overview of the following chapters is given. Chapter 2 focusses on the antifeedant activity of the drimane sesquiterpene polygodial. This dialdehyde had been described before as antifeedant to a number of insects, such as the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata, the African cotton leafworm, Spodoptera littoralis, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. In this chapter, the effect of polygodial on the feeding preference of whitefly is reported for the first time. The effect of polygodial was benchmarked against that of the more widely used natural pyrethrins, and both were also tested against M. persicae. From the results, we conclude that pyrethrins were effective against whiteflies at 18 -fold lower concentrations than polygodial (ED 50 of 1. 4 and 25 μg gFW- 1 respectively), while in the case of aphids this difference in efficacy was only two-fold (ED 50 of 28 and 54 μg gFW- 1, respectively). To adopt polygodial as a more persistent and easy to implement pest management strategy, we set out to isolate the genes responsible for its biosynthesis which could then be used to transform crops. As a basis for the selection of the right species and plant tissue to achieve this objective, Chapter 3 describes the chemical composition of one of the sources of polygodial – Persicaria hydropiper (water pepper), as well as of two other congeners (Persicaria minor and Persicaria maculosa). For all three species, GC-MS analysis of extracts of leaves and flowers was performed, which gave insight into the interspecific differences and similarities as well as into the differences between the two tissues. P. hydropiper was the species with the biggest variety and the greatest abundance of secondary metabolites, while P. maculosa had the fewest. The flowers of all species were richer in secondary metabolites compared with the leaves of the same species. Furthermore, the accumulation pattern of the identified compounds throughout the development of flowers and leaves is described. Finally, in this chapter, the possible ecological role of polygodial is also briefly addressed. Chapter 4 focuses on the discovery and characterization of genes involved in the biosynthesis of drimane sesquiterpenoids. Based on the findings of Chapter 3, we used 454 sequencing of a cDNA library constructed from young flowers of P. hydropiper and P. maculosa, for comparison, to identify a drimenol synthase (PhDS) and a drimenol oxidase (PhDOX 1) which can convert farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) into drimenol and an array of other sesquiterpenoids when working in concert. Of the compounds produced in the heterologous systems used (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana), two were identified as drimendiol and cinnamolide. The latter was purified and tested against whiteflies and aphids as described for polygodial in Chapter 2. Cinnamolide also displayed antifeedant activity against both insects, although with at slightly lower efficacy than polygodial. In the heterologous hosts used, no polygodial was detected amongst the products of the enzymatic activity of the two genes studied in this chapter. The potential reasons for this are explored in the discussion section of this chapter. Chapter 5 focuses on the volatile zingiberene, member of the bisabolane family of sesquiterpenes. This compound and its enantiomer, 7 -epi-zingiberene have both been previously identified as repellent to whiteflies. In this chapter we used Alaska yellow cedar (Callitropsis nootkatensis) as a possible source of a zingiberene synthase, which we wanted to use a primary line of defence against whitefly next to polygodial, which would be a secondary line of defence. Alaska yellow cedar produces curcumene in some of its tissues, and this metabolite is known to be a dehydrogenation product of zingiberene. An EST from a C. nootkatensis cDNA library with homology to sesquiterpene synthases was cloned and expressed in E. coli. The resulting protein converted FPP to zingiberene as the sole product. This enzyme was therefore named zingiberene synthase (CnZIS). Although no strict correlation was found between the expression levels of CnZIS in Alaska yellow cedar tissues and the accumulation of curcumene in the same tissues, those with high CnZIS expression such as leaves also produced high amounts of curcumene, while heartwood neither expressed the gene nor had detectable levels of curcumene. Subsequently, we tested the effect of transiently expressed CnZIS in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) on whiteflies. Except for one time point, the effect of zingiberene on whitefly feeding was negligible, likely due to the fact that only trace amounts of zingiberene were emitted. When genes upstream of CnZIS in the biosynthetic pathway – 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) – were co-expressed in tobacco, the antifeedant effect on whiteflies became very strong; however, there was still no detectable level of zingiberene emitted. Instead, the emission of the tobacco sesquiterpene, 5 -epi-aristolochene, was almost 100 -fold higher than in the control, not expressing HMGR and FPS. We discuss potential explanations of this phenomenon, as well as the uncommon outcome of having an endogenous sesquiterpene boosted by the co-expression and redirection to the mitochondria of the three genes of the zingiberene biosynthetic pathway. Chapter 6 brings all the findings together, discussing their place within a wider scientific perspective and their potential in the frame of IPM. Advantages as well as drawbacks of the use of GM crops are addressed. Finally, the emerging new agricultural paradigm, of a sustainable way of growing crops with less environmental impact compared with the current intensive industrial approach, is brought forth as a broad spectrum solution to most agricultural problems which arose in parallel to the intensification of agriculture that stemmed from the Green revolution...|$|R
