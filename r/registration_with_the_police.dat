50|$|Ireland {{was part}} of the United Kingdom in 1914 when the first world war broke out. The Alien Restriction Act 1914 1was passed on 5 August 1914. The Act {{introduced}} strict controls on freedom of movement of foreign nationals and introduced a system of <b>registration</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>police.</b> The Act also contained powers to deport foreign nationals and to intern all Austrian and German males between the ages of 17 and 42 i.e. men of military age. ‘The Oldcastle detention camp was the only permanent civilian POW camp in Ireland, detaining so called “enemy aliens”. 2This was due to a fear that these men would betray Britain by returning home and joining the German Army or becoming spies in Britain. Not all German and Austrian nationals residing Ireland were detained immediately. These individuals tended to be citizens who had influential contacts and promised to behave morally. However even these men were detained eventually.|$|E
