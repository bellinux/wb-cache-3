5|$|Against the {{background}} of this unrest, Charles faced bankruptcy in mid-1640. The City of London, preoccupied with its own grievances, <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any loans to the king, as did foreign powers. In this extremity, in July Charles seized silver bullion worth £130,000 held in trust at the mint in the Tower of London, promising its later return at 8% interest to its owners. In August, after the East India Company refused to grant a loan, Lord Cottington seized the company's stock of pepper and spices and sold it for £60,000 (far below its market value), promising to refund the money with interest later.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Burnham {{was one of}} the 18 {{officers}} {{selected by}} former U.S. president Theodore Roosevelt to raise a volunteer infantry division for service in France in 1917 shortly after the United States entered the war. A plan to raise volunteer soldiers from the Western U.S. came out of a meeting of the New York-based Rocky Mountain Club and Burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment. Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise up to four divisions similar to the Rough Riders of 1st United States Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and to the British Army 25th (Frontiersmen) Battalion, Royal Fusiliers; however, as Commander-in-chief, President Woodrow Wilson <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> use of Roosevelt's volunteers.|$|E

When Shay was arrested in his hotel room that night, police officers said that he appeared to be intoxicated. He <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any statements. He was held without bail and charged with second-degree murder. A conviction carried the possibility of life imprisonment. A few days after the shooting, American Association owners began to collect funds to assist in Shay's criminal defense. As the case was about to go to trial, one of the attorneys became ill, so the proceedings were delayed for several weeks. The trial was reset for November 12, 1917.|$|E
5|$|In September 1811, William Henry Harrison, then {{governor}} of Indiana Territory, visited Kentucky and directed Colonel Samuel Wells to recruit Kentuckians {{for a new}} federal regiment then being formed by the authority of Secretary of War William Eustis. Harrison had not applied to Scott for permission to recruit in the state, and many Kentuckians– from Scott's political enemy, Humphrey Marshall, to his trusted advisor, Jesse Bledsoe– perceived this as a slight to the governor. Ignoring Bledsoe's indignation, Scott <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> an issue of the faux pas and instead {{became one of the}} staunchest supporters of Harrison's rising career.|$|E

Moxon had argued that Henson was dangerous based on comments critical of Scientologists he had posted on the Internet, and his knowledge in the fields of cryonics and explosives. Hoden received a temporary restraining order against Henson, but the Riverside Superior Court judge <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the restraining order permanent.|$|E

5|$|My Truth is {{the second}} studio album by Swedish {{recording}} artist Robyn. It was released on 17 May 1999 through BMG Sweden. Robyn collaborated with producers including Lindström & Ekhé, Christian Falk, Billy Mann, Thomas Rusiak and Masters at Work during its recording. A pop and R record, My Truth is an autobiographical album for which Robyn co-wrote all fourteen songs. Certain lyrics reflect on the abortion the singer had {{in the fall of}} 1998, which sparked controversy when RCA Records began formulating a North American release. When she <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> alterations to the album per request by the label, the plans to release My Truth outside of Sweden were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Detroit, Mansour entered {{religious}} orders then earned {{a doctorate in}} biochemistry. She served {{as the president of}} Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983. She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982, in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit. The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state's social services department, and she was confirmed in early 1983. During this time, the Archbishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare herself against abortion—her department was responsible for abortion services funded through Medicaid. Mansour <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a statement, and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was to continue as director or as a nun. She chose to give up her vows as a nun. After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Antalcidas, meanwhile, {{had entered}} into {{negotiations}} with Tiribazus, and {{reached an agreement}} under which the Persians would enter into the war on the Spartan side if the allies <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace. It appears that the Persians, unnerved by certain of Athens' actions, including supporting king Evagoras of Cyprus and Akoris of Egypt, {{both of whom were}} at war with Persia, had decided that their policy of weakening Sparta by supporting its enemies was no longer useful. After escaping from the blockade at Abydos, Antalcidas attacked and defeated a small Athenian force, then united his fleet with a supporting fleet sent from Syracuse. With this force, which was soon further augmented with ships supplied by the satraps of the region, he sailed to the Hellespont, where he could cut off the trade routes that brought grain to Athens. The Athenians, mindful of their similar defeat in the Peloponnesian War less than two decades before, were ready to make peace.|$|E

As a result, he considered moving to South Australia, where a grocery magnate offered him employment and financial incentives. However, he stayed after state officials intervened, with Sir Ronald Irish, the Australian chairman of Rothmans, providing him with a job in Sydney. At the time, O'Neill had another offer. Having represented his state in baseball and been nominated in the All-Australian team in 1957, he was approached by the New York Yankees, having had experience at a pitcher and short stop. O'Neill was offered a fee more than 25 times that for a single Test match, as well as travel costs and accommodation, to trial with the Yankees. He agreed, but Irish dissuaded him {{less than a week}} before his scheduled departure.|$|E

He played in only one match in his final season in 196869, scoring a duck and 15 as New South Wales lost to South Australia by three wickets. Booth continued to play grade cricket for the St. George club until 197677, leading the batting averages and aggregates in 197475.

5|$|In September 1330, Charles {{launched}} a military expedition against Basarab of Wallachia who {{had attempted to}} get rid of his suzerainty. After seizing the fortress of Severin (present-day Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), he <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> peace with Basarab and marched towards Curtea de Argeș, which was Basarab's seat. The Wallachians applied scorched earth tactics, compelling Charles to make a truce with Basarab and withdraw his troops from Wallachia. While the royal troops were marching through a narrow pass across the Southern Carpathians on 9November, the Wallachians ambushed them. During the next four days, the royal army was decimated; Charles could only escape from the battlefield after changing his clothes with one of his knights, Desiderius Héder, who sacrificed his life to enable the king's escape. Charles did not attempt a new invasion of Wallachia, which subsequently developed into an independent principality.|$|E
5|$|Monroe next filmed a {{scene for}} Something's Got to Give {{in which she}} swam naked in a {{swimming}} pool. To generate advance publicity, the press was invited to take photographs of the scene, which were later published in Life; {{this was the first}} time that a major star had posed nude while at the height of their career. When she was again on sick leave for several days, Fox decided that it could not afford to have another film running behind schedule when it was already struggling to cover the rising costs of Cleopatra (1963). On June 7, Fox fired Monroe and sued her for $750,000 in damages. She was replaced by Lee Remick, but after Martin <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film with anyone other than Monroe, Fox sued him as well and shut down the production. The studio blamed Monroe for the film's demise and began spreading negative publicity about her, even alleging that she was mentally disturbed.|$|E
5|$|The Archbishop of Canterbury, Ralph d'Escures, {{refused to}} consecrate Thurstan unless the archbishop-elect made a {{profession}} of {{obedience to the}} southern see. This {{was part of the}} long-running Canterbury-York dispute, which started in 1070. Thurstan <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> such a profession, and asked the king for permission to go to Rome to consult Pope Paschal II. Henry I refused to allow him to make the journey, but even without a personal appeal from Thurstan, Paschal decided against Canterbury. At the Council of Salisbury in 1116 the English king ordered Thurstan to submit to Canterbury, but instead Thurstan publicly resigned the archibishopric. On his way to the Council, Thurstan had received letters from Paschal II that supported York and commanded that he should be consecrated without a profession. Similar letters had gone to Ralph d'Escures from the pope, ordering Ralph, as Archbishop of Canterbury, to consecrate Thurstan. After the news of the letters became public, Thurstan's resignation was ignored, and he continued to be considered the archbishop-elect.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, New York Herald editor John Mullaly {{pushed for the}} {{creation}} of parks in New York City, particularly lauding the Van Cortlandt and Pell families' properties in the western and eastern Bronx respectively. He formed the New York Park Association in November 1881. Mullaly noted that New York City had less parkland per capita than many major European cities, and that the 1853 construction of Central Park had raised property values around the park immediately after construction. His association sent out pamphlets to high-profile New Yorkers, advocating for a new park. However, controversies arose over the proposals for new parks in the Bronx, and so the city did not authorize a commission for the planned new parks. Since the city <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a park commission, the New York Park Association appealed to the New York State Legislature instead. On April 19, 1883, the state passed a law authorizing a seven-person commission headed by association member Luther Marsh, which would be responsible for scouting out sites for future parks in the 23rd and 24th wards of New York City (now the portion of the Bronx that is west of the Bronx River). Mullaly was named the secretary, In June 1883, the commission visited the park site, and by January 1884, Marsh had drafted a bill to the New York State Legislature regarding a proposed park system in the Bronx, comprising six parks connected by three parkways.|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When the time for the vote came, however, Garfield <b>refused</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
