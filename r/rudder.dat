5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on {{the port}} side, near the port <b>rudder</b> shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} <b>rudder</b> assembly was badly damaged and the <b>rudder</b> became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard <b>rudder</b> but the port <b>rudder</b> remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port <b>rudder</b> with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the <b>rudder</b> did not positively center, these problems were corrected by revising the <b>rudder</b> control system. The unpowered <b>rudder</b> did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin balanced rudders behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central <b>rudder</b> used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the <b>rudder</b> and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|E
5000|$|Small boat <b>rudders</b> {{that can}} be steered more or less {{perpendicular}} to the hull's longitudinal axis make effective brakes when pushed [...] "hard over." [...] However, terms such as [...] "hard over," [...] "hard to starboard," [...] etc. signify a maximum-rate turn for larger vessels. Transom hung <b>rudders</b> or far aft mounted fin <b>rudders</b> generate greater moment and faster turning than more forward mounted keel hung <b>rudders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The starter starts controllers, one for {{vertical}} tail <b>rudders,</b> {{and another for}} roll <b>rudders</b> for anti-rolling in both side wing <b>rudders,</b> with horizontal tail <b>rudders</b> being locked at uppermost position, while the torpedo falls {{down to the water}} surface. It starts the main engine to propel when the torpedo hits the water. A thick safety bolt is inserted into the starter when the weapon is loaded on an aircraft. The bolt is pulled out from the torpedo when it is released. The bolt remains underneath the fuselage of aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Although quarter <b>rudders</b> {{were the}} norm in Nile navigation, the Egyptians {{were the first to}} use also stern-mounted <b>rudders</b> (not of the modern type but center mounted {{steering}} oars).|$|R
5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and enlisted men. The Swiftsures were quite manoeuvrable {{as a result}} of their balanced <b>rudder</b> and a hull form optimized to make the <b>rudder</b> more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Dominik von Kripp {{suggested}} that the crest may {{have served as a}} <b>rudder,</b> an idea embraced by several later researchers. One researcher, Ross S. Stein, even {{suggested that}} the crest may have supported a membrane of skin connecting the backward-pointing crest to the neck and back, increasing its surface area and effectiveness as a <b>rudder.</b> The <b>rudder</b> hypothesis again, {{does not take into account}} females nor P. sternbergi, which had an upward-pointing, not backward-pointing crest. Bennett also found that even in its capacity as a <b>rudder,</b> the crest would not provide nearly so much directional force as simply maneuvering the wings. The suggestion that the crest was an air brake, and that the animals would turn their heads to the side in order to slow down, suffers from a similar problem. Additionally, the <b>rudder</b> and air brake hypotheses do not explain why such large variation exists in crest size even among adults.|$|E
5|$|The pilot applied 30 degree flaps and 1/3 right <b>rudder.</b>|$|E
50|$|Due to some {{challenges}} of steering the boat downwind in a blow, some boats were fitted with elliptical <b>rudders</b> to improve handling. These <b>rudders</b> were typically fabricated by Moore.|$|R
50|$|The anti-rolling {{controller}} {{is actually}} a steering controller to stabilize the rolling motion of the torpedo by roll <b>rudders</b> on both sides. The roll <b>rudders</b> work within angler range +/-22.5 degrees, twisting in ailerons manner.When a torpedo is rolling or rolls to some degree, the anti-rolling controller twists those <b>rudders</b> in the counter-rolling direction. When a torpedo is rolling back to its neutral position of 0 degree, the controller sense it and switches roll <b>rudders</b> {{in the opposite direction}} to break angular velocity of torpedo rolling back, or countersteering. They naval engineers called this operation as countersteer as they modeled it to steer a ship.|$|R

5|$|A <b>rudder</b> and {{a section}} of {{propeller}} shaft were {{on display at the}} Arashiyama Art Museum until it closed around 1991. The <b>rudder,</b> an anchor and one propeller have been relocated to the JMSDF Kure Museum, directly {{across the street from the}} Yamato Museum. The left-side 410mm gun from No. 3 turret is displayed outside as well, in Daiwa Park, Kure. The current whereabouts of the propeller shaft is now unknown.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the <b>rudder</b> is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors forward of the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, forward of the <b>rudder.</b> In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the <b>rudder</b> may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|Because of the B-52's mission parameters, {{only modest}} {{maneuvers}} {{would be required}} with no need for spin recovery. The aircraft has a relatively small, narrow chord <b>rudder,</b> giving it limited yaw control authority. Originally an all-moving vertical stabilizer was to be used, but was abandoned because of doubts about hydraulic actuator reliability. Because the aircraft has eight engines, asymmetrical thrust due {{to the loss of}} an engine in flight would be minimal and correctable with the narrow <b>rudder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "The word 'value,' {{when used}} without adjunct, always means, in {{political}} economy, value in exchange" [...] (Mill, III. i. 3). So that, if two ships cannot exchange their <b>rudders,</b> their <b>rudders</b> are, in politico-economic language, of no value to either.|$|R
50|$|In an OC1, {{the single}} paddler must also steer the canoe. Some OC1s have <b>rudders</b> {{operated}} by foot pedals, while OC1s without <b>rudders</b> must be steered by drawing and paddling as needed for steering purposes while paddling {{to move the}} canoe forward.|$|R
50|$|The Latécoère 550 had its {{tailplane}} {{mounted on}} top of the fuselage, strut braced from below and bearing twin inboard fins and <b>rudders</b> separately braced {{to the top of the}} fuselage. During flight trials, these vertical surfaces evolved in stages from a rather blunt shape, with extensions below the tailplane to a surface with a smoothly curved trailing edge entirely above the tailplane. The <b>rudders</b> were fitted with trim tabs. Because of the inboard <b>rudders,</b> the elevators had three sections.|$|R
5|$|In short, the Wrights {{discovered}} the true {{purpose of the}} movable vertical <b>rudder.</b> Its role was not to change the direction of flight (as a <b>rudder</b> does in sailing), but rather, to aim or align the aircraft correctly during banking turns and when leveling off from turns and wind disturbances. The actual turn—the change in direction—was done with roll control using wing-warping. The principles remained the same when ailerons superseded wing-warping.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} by a single balanced <b>rudder,</b> which gave the ships excellent maneuverability. The <b>rudder</b> was augmented with special steering system on the engine transmissions; they had gears that could drive half of the engines astern and half forward allowed the screws to assist in turning the ship at sharper angles. The ships tended toward lee helm in general conditions, but in heavy wind, they suffered from weather helm. Both vessels also suffered from severe leeway at low speeds, and the effect was especially pronounced for Nürnberg, owing to her larger superstructure.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and <b>rudder</b> bar which operated the powered flying controls (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the <b>rudder</b> which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rudders</b> do {{not have}} to rotate upwards in low water, but slide upwards inside their cheek plates when a {{retaining}} line is pulled. The boat can still be steered when the <b>rudders</b> are at the keel line, this allows sailing in areas with low water levels.|$|R

5|$|The {{class had}} greatly {{improved}} handling characteristics over the preceding Nassau class. The Helgolands were much better sea boats {{and did not}} suffer from the severe rolling that the Nassaus did. The ships were responsive to the helm, and had a tight turning radius, and lost only minimal speed during swells. The ships lost up to 54% of their speed at hard <b>rudder,</b> and would heel up to 7°. For comparison, the earlier Nassaus lost up to 70% speed and held a 12° heel with the <b>rudder</b> hard over.|$|E
5|$|The ship's {{steering}} was by a contrabalanced <b>rudder</b> (black, at {{left in the}} picture), {{with its}} associated steering gear located in a compartment (green in the picture) above the <b>rudder</b> and below the aft structure. Steam-powered generators provided electric power for radios, navigation equipment, refrigeration compressors, pumps, lighting, and degaussing. An evaporator produced fresh water for the boilers and for the crew.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to roll, the Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard <b>rudder.</b> The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard <b>rudder.</b>|$|E

50|$|A HangBoard bolts to a {{standard}} snowboard in place of bindings, and the pilot — wearing a harness — hangs from a T-shaped bar. Arms push against handlebars in the front, and feet clamp into <b>rudders</b> at the back. Most control occurs by weight shifting, but pilots can also achieve directional control by using the foot <b>rudders.</b> Applied simultaneously, the <b>rudders</b> function as brakes. The HangBoard frame is made of aircraft aluminum, weighs less than 11 kg without the snowboard, and measures 160 cm long, 32 cm high when folded up, and 47 cm wide.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect was}} noticed at speeds above 25 knots, by {{swinging}} the [...] "effect" [...] <b>rudders</b> outboard by 30°. Once attained, the effect <b>rudders</b> could be swing back to 17° outboard, {{and the speed}} could be reduced to as little as 20kn while still maintaining {{the benefits of the}} effect.|$|R
5|$|Directional {{stability}} {{was achieved}} by four fixed vanes, two vertical and two horizontal, attached {{at the rear of}} the gas-bag, and by a long vertical vane running along the main axis of the gas-bag from the centre of the elliptical frame to its rear. Horizontal motion was controlled by the movement of a balanced <b>rudder</b> at the rear of an empennage on a long boom, mounted below the gas-bag and aft of the gondola (see lead image). The empennage consisted of vertical and horizontal vanes arranged like the fletching of an arrow, behind which the vertical <b>rudder</b> was mounted. During a refit in 1907 the vertical vanes of the empennage were modified, as is shown in the accompanying illustration.|$|E
5|$|On 12 April 1990, Widerøe Flight 839 crashed {{one minute}} after take-off, killing all five on board. It {{was caused by}} high wind speeds, {{in excess of the}} {{construction}} dimensions, cracking the tail <b>rudder</b> and vertical stabilizer, crashing the plane in the sea after eight seconds.|$|E
5|$|Steering was {{controlled}} {{with a single}} <b>rudder.</b> The ships were described as good sea-boats, but were prone to heavy pitching. The ships were responsive and had a tight turning radius at low speed, but at hard <b>rudder</b> of 12degrees, the ships lost up to 70percent speed. The ships had a crew of 35officers and 708men normally, and when serving as a squadron flagship, they had an additional 13officers and 66men. The ships carried a number of smaller boats aboard, including two picket boats, two launches, a pinnace (later removed), two cutters, two yawls, and two dinghies.|$|E
