However the O(N log N) control complexity of the Benes is not optimal for many permutations. In this paper, we present a novel <b>rearrangeable</b> <b>network</b> that is permutation-specific control-optimal, i. e., it has the lowest control complexity for every input permutation. This network is based on another network we label KR-Benes. The KR-Benes exploits locality properties of permutations (called K-boundedness) and is derived by making some small modifications to the Benes. The KR-Benes network has a depth of 2 logK + 2 stages and a control complexity of O(N log K). The KR-Benes is superior to the Benes from the hardware point of view for K ≤ N / √ 8 and has a lower control complexity when K ≤ N / √ 2. In this paper, we show that any optimal network for rearrangeably routing K-bounded permutations must have depth at least 2 logK + 1. We also provide arguments for conjecturing that the optimal network, in fact has 2 logK + 2 stages, and therefore the KR-Benes is optimal. Finally, we use the KR-Benes to derive the permutationspecific control-optimal network for routing arbitrary permutations.

Networks such as the Benes [1] have been used for over 40 years, yet the uniform N(2 logN − 1) control {{complexity}} of the N × N Benes is not optimal for many permutations. To the best of our knowledge, there are no results in the literature that improve this control complexity. In this paper, we present a novel N × N <b>rearrangeable</b> <b>network</b> called KR-Benes that is permutation-specific control-optimal. The KR-Benes routes every permutation with the (conjectured) minimal control complexity specific to that permutation and is provably within an additive linear factor (N) of the optimal for that permutation (corresponding to controlling one extra stage of switching elements). In fact, the worst-case complexity of the KR-Benes for arbitrary permutations is bounded by the Benes; thus it replaces the Benes when considering control complexity/latency. We construct the KR-Benes by first designing a restricted <b>rearrangeable</b> <b>network</b> called K-Benes for optimally routing K-bounded permutations with control 2 N log K, 0 ≤ K ≤ N/ 2, using a simple modification of the Benes network looping algorithm.

Each K-Benes network is shown to have a depth of one more stage than this provable lower bound.

The study of this problem begins with the pioneering work of Shannon, Slepian, Clos and Beneˇs in the 1950 ’s who studied the balanced N = K case, and arbitrary depth ℓ, and later on by Pippenger and Yao who used expanders to construct small depth, balanced connectors. In the last decade there has been research on the unbalanced case. This started with Oruç who showed an explicit construction with O(N) edges, for K ≤ N log(N), and proved some lower bounds on small depth networks. Later on Baltz, Jäger, and Srivastav suggested an explicit depth two construction for the K ≤ √ N case with O(N √ K) edges, which was followed by an entirely different depth two construction by Ahlswede and Aydinian with O(N log K) edges, but which worked only for K ≤ N O(1 / √ log N). We show that non-constructively depth two connectors with O(N) edges exist for K ≤ N 1 / 2 −ɛ, for every constant ɛ> 0. Furthermore, for that range we show an explicit construction with only N poly(log N) edges. The solution is based on new expander techniques that were developed in the study of extractors. We believe that these new tools can be very useful in other network constructions as well. We feel that despite the success of these newer tools in theoretical computer science they are still widely neglected in network design, partly because they are so new.

40|$|A {{class of}} {{symmetric}} <b>rearrangeable</b> nonblocking <b>networks</b> {{has been considered}} in this thesis. A particular focus of this thesis is on Benes networks built with 2 x 2 switching elements. Symmetric <b>rearrangeable</b> <b>networks</b> built with larger switching elements have also being considered. New applications of these networks {{are found in the}} areas of System on Chip (SoC) and Network on Chip (NoC). Deterministic routing algorithms used in NoC applications suffer low scalability and slow execution time. On the other hand, faster algorithms are blocking and thus limit throughput. This will be an acceptable trade-off for many applications where achieving ”wire speed” on the on-chip network would require extensive optimisation of the attached devices. In this thesis I designed an algorithm that has much lower blocking probabilities than other suboptimal algorithms but a much faster execution time than deterministic routing algorithms. The suboptimal method uses the looping algorithm in its outermost stages and then in the two distinct subnetworks deeper in the switch uses a fast but suboptimal path search method to find available paths. The worst case time complexity of this new routing method is O(NlogN) using a single processor, which matches the best known results reported in the literature. Disruption of the ongoing communications in this class of networks during rearrangements is an open issue. In this thesis I explored a modification of the topology of these networks which gives rise to what is termed as repackable networks. A repackable topology allows rearrangements of paths without intermittently losing connectivity by breaking the existing communication paths momentarily. The repackable network structure proposed in this thesis is efficient in its use of hardware when compared to other proposals in the literature. As most of the deterministic algorithms designed for Benes networks implement a permutation of all inputs to find the routing tags for the requested inputoutput pairs, I proposed a new algorithm that can work for partial permutations. If the network load is defined as ρ, the mean number of active inputs in a partial permutation is, m = ρN, where N is the network size. This new method is based on mapping the network stages into a set of sub-matrices and then determines the routing tags for each pair of requests by populating the cells of the sub-matrices without creating a blocking state. Overall the serial time complexity of this method is O(NlogN) and O(mlogN) where all N inputs are active and with m < N active inputs respectively. With minor modification to the serial algorithm this method can be made to work in the parallel domain. The time complexity of this routing algorithm in a parallel machine with N completely connected processors is O(log^ 2 N). With m active requests the time complexity goes down to (logmlogN), which is better than the O(log^ 2 m + logN), reported in the literature for 2 ^ 0. 5 ((log^ 2 - 4 logN) ^ 0. 5 -logN) <= ρ <= 1. I also designed multistage symmetric <b>rearrangeable</b> <b>networks</b> using larger switching elements and implement a new routing algorithm for these classes of networks. The network topology and routing algorithms presented in this thesis should allow large scale networks of modest cost, with low setup times and moderate blocking rates, to be constructed. Such switching networks will be required to meet the bandwidth requirements of future communication networks...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} finding routing {{algorithms}} on the multirate <b>rearrangeable</b> Clos <b>networks</b> which use as few number of middle-stage switches as possible. We propose a new routing algorithm called the “grouping algorithm”. This is a simple algorithm which uses fewer middle-stage switches than all known strategies, given {{that the number of}} input-stage switches and output-stage switches are relatively small compared to the size of input and output switches. In particular, the grouping algorithm implies that m = 2 n + ⌈ n− 1 2 k ⌉ is a sufficient number of middlestage switches for the symmetric 3 -stage Clos network C(n, m, r) to be multirate rearrangeable, where k is any positive integer and r ≤ n/(2 k − 1). ...|$|R
