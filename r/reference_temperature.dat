40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of}} canopy temperatures was conducted around {{a small and}} large gap at a forested alpine site in the Swiss Alps during the 2015 and 2016 snowmelt seasons (March-April). Canopy temperatures within the small gap were within 2 - 3 °C of measured <b>reference</b> air <b>temperature.</b> Vertical and horizontal variations in canopy temperatures were greatest around the large gap, varying up to 18 °C above measured <b>reference</b> air <b>temperature</b> during clear-sky days. Night-time canopy temperatures around the study site were up to 3 °C cooler than <b>reference</b> air <b>temperature.</b> These measurements were used to develop a simple parametrization for correcting <b>reference</b> air <b>temperature</b> for elevated canopy temperatures during 1) night-time conditions (sub-canopy shortwave radiation is 0 Wm- 2) and 2) periods of increased sub-canopy shortwave radiation > 400 Wm- 2 representing penetration of shortwave radiation through the canopy. Sub-canopy shortwave and longwave radiation collected at a single point in the sub-canopy over a 24 -hour clear sky period was used to calculate a night-time bulk offset of 3 °C for scenario 1 and develop a multiple linear regression model for scenario 2 using <b>reference</b> air <b>temperature</b> and sub-canopy shortwave radiation to predict canopy temperature with an RMSE of 0. 7 °C. Outside of these two scenarios, <b>reference</b> air <b>temperature</b> was used to predict sub-canopy incoming longwave radiation.

40|$|Thermal imaging {{can detect}} {{variation}} in stomatal conductance and therefore spatial {{variation in the}} water status of grapevine. Temporal variation can also be assessed, using indices that relate canopy <b>temperature</b> to <b>reference</b> <b>temperatures,</b> but, as yet, there is no standard approach to obtain these reference values. Also, the potential of above-canopy imaging is uncertain for vine rows with mainly vertically oriented leaves. Thermal images of the side (vertical leaves) and top (horizontal leaves) of ‘Tempranillo’ (Vitis vinifera L.) grapevine rows were captured on different dates and in different plots in a vineyard in the Rioja, Spain. <b>Reference</b> <b>temperatures</b> were determined separately (i) as the temperature of artificial leaves placed in the grapevine canopy, or (ii) by calculation from the leaf energy budget. With respect to imaging the side of grapevine rows, the two approaches exhibited similar potential to indicate variation in stomatal conductance or stem water potential within a single date and time of day. Over different dates (implying temporal as well as spatial variability) and {{both sides of the}} grapevines, the use of the artificial surfaces resulted in stronger correlations between thermal indices and physiological variables than the application of energy budget models. The use of such reference surfaces would allow a standardised approach to thermography. Imaging the top of rows produced some highly significant correlations between thermal indices and physiological variables. Modified artificial leaves could be developed to standardise the determination of <b>reference</b> <b>temperatures,</b> at the same spatial resolution as the leaves of interest. That imaging the top of grapevine canopies provides useful information on water status suggests that aerial imaging could be used to assess spatial variation in water status across entire vineyards.
