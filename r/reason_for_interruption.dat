40|$|Background The antifolate {{methotrexate}} (MTX) is {{an important}} component of maintenance therapy in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), although MTX-related toxicity is a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>interruption</b> of chemotherapy. Prediction of toxicity is difficult, because of inter-individual variability to antileukemic agents. The MTX action mechanism interferes with folate metabolism leading to depletion of reduced folates. DESIGN AND METHODS: The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the influence of folate polymorphisms respect to toxicity and survival in adult ALL patients treated with MTX maintenance therapy. To this purpose, we evaluated in ALL patients possible associations between genotype and haematological and non-haematological toxicity and effects on survival at 2 years of follow-up. RESULTS: Polymorphisms in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR 677 C>T) and in dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR 19 bp deletion) genes significantly increased the risk of hepatotoxicity in single (OR 5. 23, 95 %CI 1. 13 - 21. 95 and OR 4. 57, 95 %CI 1. 01 - 20. 77, respectively) and in combined analysis (OR 6. 82, 95 %CI 1. 38 - 33. 59). MTHFR 677 C>T increased also the risk of leukopenia and gastrointestinal toxicity, whilst thymidylate synthase 28 bp repeat polymorphism increased the risk of anaemia (OR 8. 48, 95 %CI 2. 00 - 36. 09). Finally, MTHFR 677 TT patients had even a decreased rate of overall survival (HR 2. 37, 95 %CI 1. 46 - 8. 45). Conclusions Genotyping of folate polymorphisms might be useful in adult ALL to optimize MTX therapy reducing the associated toxicity with possible effects on survival...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Adequate {{nutritional}} {{support is}} crucial in prevention and treatment of malnutrition in critically ill-patients. Despite the intention to provide appropriate enteral nutrition (EN), meeting the full nutritional requirements {{can be a challenge}} due to interruptions. This study was undertaken to determine the cause and duration of interruptions in EN. Materials and Methods: Patients admitted to a multidisciplinary critical care unit (CCU) of a tertiary care hospital from September 2010 to January 2011 and who received EN for a period > 24 h were included in this observational, prospective study. A total of 327 patients were included, for a total of 857 patient-days. Reasons and duration of EN interruptions were recorded and categorized under four groups-procedures inside CCU, procedures outside CCU, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and others. Results: Procedure inside CCU accounted for 55. 9 % of the interruptions while GI symptoms for 24. 2 %. Although it is commonly perceived that procedures outside CCU are the most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>interruption,</b> this contributed only to 18. 4 % individually; ventilation-related procedures were the most frequent cause (40. 25 %), followed by nasogastric tube aspirations (15. 28 %). Although GI bleed is often considered a reason to hold enteral feed, {{it was one of the}} least common reasons (1 %) in our study. Interruption of 2 - 6 h was more frequent (43 %) and most of this (67. 1 %) was related to "procedures inside CCU". Conclusion: Awareness of reasons for EN interruptions will aid to modify protocol and minimize interruptions during procedures in CCU to reach nutrition goals...|$|E

40|$|Background: There are {{numerous}} challenges in providing nutrition to the mechanically ventilated critically ill ICU patient. Understanding {{the level of}} nutritional support and the barriers to enteral feeding interruption in mechanically ventilated patients are important to maximise the nutritional benefits to the critically ill patients. Thus, this study aims to evaluate enteral nutrition delivery and identify the reasons for interruptions in mechanically ventilated Malaysian patients receiving enteral feeding. Methods: A cross sectional prospective study of 77 consecutive patients who required mechanical ventilation and were receiving enteral nutrition was done in an open 14 -bed intensive care unit of a tertiary hospital. Data were collected prospectively over a 3 month period. Descriptive statistical analysis were made with respect to demographical data, time taken to initiate feeds, type of feeds, quantification of feeds attainment, and reasons for feed interruptions. There are no set feeding protocols in the ICU. The usual initial rate of enteral nutrition observed in ICU was 20 ml/hour, assessed every 6 hours and {{the decision was made}} thereafter to increase feeds. The target calorie for each patient was determined by the clinician alongside the dietitian. The use of prokinetic agents was also prescribed at the discretion of the attending clinician and is commonly IV metoclopramide 10 mg three times a day. Results: About 66 % of patients achieved 80 % of caloric requirements within 3 days of which 46. 8 % achieved full feeds in less than 12 hours. The time to initiate feeds for patients admitted into the ICU ranged from 0 - 110 hours with a median time to start feeds of 15 hours and the interquartile range (IQR) of 6 - 59 hours. The mean time to achieve at least 80 % of nutritional target was 1. 8 days +/- 1. 5 days. About 79 % of patients experienced multiple feeding interruptions. The most prevalent <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>interruption</b> was for procedures (45. 1 %) followed by high gastric residual volume (38. 0 %), diarrhoea (8. 4 %), difficulty in nasogastric tube placement (5. 6 %) and vomiting (2. 9 %). Conclusion: Nutritional inadequacy in mechanically ventilated Malaysian patients receiving enteral nutrition was not as common as expected. However, there is still room for improvement with regards to decreasing the number of patients who did not achieve their caloric requirement throughout their stay in the ICU...|$|E
40|$|IntroduÃÃo: A aderÃncia ao tratamento de doenÃas crÃnicas Ã uma questÃo complexa e envolve nÃo sÃ a responsabilidade das pessoas afetadas, mas tambÃm das equipes profissionais de saÃde e das redes sociais. Nos Ãltimos anos, a nÃo adesÃo Ã poliquimioterapia (PQT) foi reduzida significativamente no Brasil. No entanto, a questÃo ainda Ã um obstÃculo importante no controle da doenÃa, podendo levar a permanÃncia de fontes de infecÃÃo, cura incompleta, complicaÃÃes irreversÃveis e multiresistÃncia. MÃtodos: Realizamos um estudo de base populacional em 78 municÃpios pertencentes a uma Ãrea endÃmica (cluster 1) de hansenÃase, no norte do estado de Tocantins. Tocantins Ã o estado com os maiores Ãndices de taxa de detecÃÃo anual (88. 54 / 100. 000 na populaÃÃo geral e 26. 48 / 100. 000 em 12 months); and {{interruption}} of MDT (defined as duration PB treatment > 7 months; and of MB treatment > 13 months). In addition, we asked participants {{who said that}} they had interrupted MDT at least once in an open question about their reasons for interrupting. Results: Of the total of 936 individuals included in data analysis, 491 (52. 5 %) were males; the age ranged from 5 to 99 years (mean= 42. 1 years). Two-hundred and twenty-five (24. 0 %) were illiterate. In total, 497 (55. 6 %) were classified as PB, and 395 (44. 1 %) as MB leprosy. We identified 28 (3. 0 %) patients who defaulted MDT; 16 defaulters were included by reviewing the SINAN data information system, and an additional 12 locally in the patientsâ charts during field work. In total, 147 / 806 (18, 2 %) interrupted MDT. Defaulting was significantly associated with: low number of rooms per household (OR= 3. 43; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 98 â 9. 69; p= 0. 03); moving to another residence after diagnosis (OR= 2. 90; 0. 95 â 5. 28; p= 0. 04); and low family income (OR= 2. 42; 1. 02 â 5. 63 : p= 0. 04). Interruption of treatment was associated with: low number of rooms per household (OR= 1. 95; 0. 98 â 3. 70; p= 0. 04); difficulty in swallowing MDT drugs (OR= 1. 66; 1. 03 â 2. 63; p= 0. 02); temporal non-availability of MDT at the health center (OR= 1. 67; 1. 11 â 2. 46; p= 0. 01); and moving to another residence (OR= 1. 58; 1. 03 â 2. 40; p= 0. 03). Logistic regression identified temporal nonavailability of MDT as an independent risk factor for treatment interruption (adjusted OR= 1. 56; 1. 05 â 2. 33; p= 0. 03), and residence size as a protective factor (adjusted OR= 0. 89 per additional number of rooms; 0. 80 â 0. 99; p= 0. 03). Residence size was also independently associated with defaulting (adjusted OR= 0. 67; 0. 52 â 0. 88; p= 0. 003). In addition, we identified 334 (35. 6 %) participants who {{said that they had}} interrupted MDT at least once. The median time of interruption stated by study participants was 15 days, with a maximum of three years (interquartile range: 6 - 30 days). The most common <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>interruption</b> given by these was non-availability of medication at the respective health care centre (211; 62. 9 %). Others forgot to take the medicine (44; 12. 0 %) or interrupted due to drug-related adverse events (28; 8. 3 %). Conclusions: The study shows that there are still challenges to be tackled regarding MDT in Brazil. As a consequence of the efforts done by the Tocantins State Leprosy Control Program, healthservice related factors played a minor role, despite intermittent shortage of drug supply. An integrated approach is needed for further improving control, focusing on the most vulnerable population groups such as the socio-economically underprivileged and migrants. MDT producers should consider oral drug formulations that may be more easily accepted by patients. Considering the consequences of low adherence to treatment, such as possible development of MDT resistance, and persisting sources of transmission, future in-depth studies are needed to improve further adherence, mainly in hyperendemic region...|$|E

Methods: We assessed patients&rsquo; clinical outcomes of HIV&ndash;HCV coinfected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy attending the Ottawa Hospital Immunodeficiency Clinic from January 1996 to June 2008. Results: We assessed 144 males and 39 females. Although similar in most baseline characteristics, the CD 4 count was higher in females (375 vs 290 cells/&mu;L). Fewer females initiated ritonavir-boosted regimens. The median duration on therapy before interruption or change was longer in males (10 versus 4 months) (odds ratio [OR] 1. 40 95 % confidence interval: 0. 95 &ndash; 2. 04; P = 0. 09). HIV RNA suppression was frequent (74 %) and mean CD 4 count achieved robust (over 400 cells/&mu;L) at 6 months, irrespective of sex. The primary <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> therapy <b>interruption</b> in females and males included: gastrointestinal intolerance (25 % vs 19 %; P = 0. 42); poor adherence (22 % vs 15 %; P = 0. 31); neuropsychiatric symptoms (19 % vs 5 %; P = 0. 003); and lost to follow-up (3 % vs 13 %; P = 0. 08). Seven males (5 %) and no females discontinued therapy for liver-specific complications. Death rate was higher in females (23 % vs 7 %; P = 0. 003). Conclusion: There are subtle differences in the characteristics of female and male HIV&ndash;HCV coinfected patients that influence HIV treatment decisions. The <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> treatment <b>interruption</b> and change differ by biological sex. This knowledge should be considered when starting HIV therapy and in efforts to improve treatment outcomes.

25|$|As to the Book of Isaiah, {{in spite}} of the {{prevalent}} opinion that chapters 40-66 were written after the Babylonian captivity, Luzzatto maintained that the whole book was written by Isaiah. He felt that one of the factors that pushed scholars to post-date the latter portion of the book stemmed from a denial of the possibility of prophetic prediction of distant-future events, and therefore was a heretical position. Difference of opinion on this point was one of the causes why Luzzatto, after having maintained a friendly correspondence with Rapoport, turned against the latter. Another <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> the <b>interruption</b> of his relations with the chief rabbi of Prague was that Luzzatto, though otherwise on good terms with Jost, could not endure the latter's extreme rationalism. He consequently requested Rapoport to cease his relations with Jost; but Rapoport, not knowing Luzzatto personally, ascribed the request to arrogance.|$|R
30|$|While {{women are}} on average one year younger than men, their average labor market {{experience}} difference is about 3 years shorter, owing to motherhood {{and child care}} responsibilities. Most studies on the gender wage gap can only account for potential experience as the length of and the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> work time <b>interruptions</b> is usually not known. Zweimüller and Winter-Ebmer (1994) and Böheim et al. (2007) have demonstrated {{that it is necessary}} to account for differences in actual rather than potential experience to obtain reliable estimates of the wage determinants. The summary statistics also show that fewer women than men are married.|$|R
40|$|Interim {{analysis}} of data accumulated in clinical trials is {{one aspect of the}} monitoring of the study progress. It is usually done to assess whether there are significant differences in efficacy between the experimental and control treatment groups, in order to decide whether to stop or no the trial prematurely. Among many <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> early <b>interruption</b> of a trial is the ethical consideration that subjects should not be exposed to an unsafe, inferior or ineffective treatment. Statistical methods suited for doing interim analysis, that allow to control the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no treatment differences, are often not well understood by researchers. In this article we present an intuitive, non-mathematical explanation and review of the statistical methods for doing interim analysis in clinical trials along with an illustrative example of the application of the methods on a hypothetical dataset (Rev Méd Chile 2000; 128 : 935 - 41) ...|$|R
40|$|Between 1950 and 1973, labour {{productivity}} was converging between the United States and western Europe and Japan. The convergence gradually lost momentum and has ceased altogether since 1995. To explain the <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> the <b>interruption,</b> we first use the econometric tests developed by Bai and Perron {{to determine the}} trend-break dates. Labour productivity growth quickened in the U. S. from 1992, but slowed in most European countries. Technological progress driven by the expansion of {{information and communication technologies}} (ICTs) partly explains the revival of {{labour productivity}} in the U. S., but is inconsistent with the slowdown in labour productivity growth in Europe. While Europes ICT investment rate was lower than that of the U. S., it did rise significantly. A key explanation lies in the intensity of the job content of growth. The latter has declined sharply in the U. S. but grown substantially in Europe, reducing mass unemployment.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} effect of career breaks on the working lives of women using survey data from the state of Queensland in Australia. After {{estimating}} the income penalty faced by women with career interruptions - according to the duration of, and <b>reasons</b> <b>for,</b> the <b>interruptions</b> - we seek to address a wider set of issues regarding: patterns of job change and income gains or losses related to job change; determinants of career re-entry plans; and satisfaction with hours worked. As women increasingly combine motherhood and employment, they face both penalties and costs, particularly if they have taken a career break in order to care for their young. This general labor market failure that penalizes motherhood should be addressed by relevant measures related to their income, working hours, and the type and status of employment, particularly on their re-entry into employment after a child-related career break.
