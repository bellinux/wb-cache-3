40|$|This article {{introduces}} {{the principles of}} underground <b>rockbolting</b> design. The items discussed include underground loading conditions, natural pressure zone around an underground opening, design methodologies, selection of rockbolt types, determination of bolt length and spacing, factor of safety, and compatibility between support elements. Different types of <b>rockbolting</b> used in engineering practise are also presented. The traditional principle of selecting strong rockbolts is valid only in conditions of low in situ stresses in the rock mass. Energy-absorbing rockbolts are preferred {{in the case of}} high in situ stresses. A natural pressure arch is formed in the rock at a certain distance behind the tunnel wall. Rockbolts should be long enough to reach the natural pressure arch when the failure zone is small. The bolt length should be at least 1  m beyond the failure zone. In the case of a vast failure zone, tightly spaced short rockbolts are installed to establish an artificial pressure arch within the failure zone and long cables are anchored on the natural pressure arch. In this case, the rockbolts are usually less than 3  m long in mine drifts, but can be up to 7  m in large-scale rock caverns. Bolt spacing is more important than bolt length in the case of establishing an artificial pressure arch. In addition to the factor of safety, the maximum allowable displacement in the tunnel and the ultimate displacement capacity of rockbolts must be also taken into account in the design. Finally, rockbolts should be compatible with other support elements in the same support system in terms of displacement and energy absorption capacities...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis is {{a review}} {{paper on the}} {{performances}} of both conventional and energy-absorbing <b>rockbolts</b> manifested in laboratory tests. Characteristic parameters such as ultimate load, displacement and energy absorption are reported, in addition to load–displacement graphs for every type of <b>rockbolt.</b> Conventional <b>rockbolts</b> refer to mechanical <b>rockbolts,</b> fully-grouted rebars and frictional <b>rockbolts.</b> According to the test results, under static pull loading a mechanical <b>rockbolt</b> usually fails at the plate; a fully-grouted rebar bolt fails in the bolt shank at an ultimate load equal {{to the strength of}} the steel after a small amount of displacement; and a frictional <b>rockbolt</b> is subjected to large displacement at a low yield load. Under shear loading, all types of bolts fail in the shank. Energy-absorbing <b>rockbolts</b> are developed aiming to combat instability problems in burst-prone and squeezing rock conditions. They absorb deformation energy either through ploughing/slippage at predefined load levels or through stretching of the steel bolt. An energy-absorbing <b>rockbolt</b> can carry a high load and also accommodate significant rock displacement, and thus its energy-absorbing capacity is high. The test results show that the energy absorption of the energy-absorbing bolts is much larger than that of all conventional bolts. The dynamic load capacity is smaller than the static load capacity for the energy-absorbing bolts displacing based on ploughing/slippage while they are approximately the same for the D-Bolt that displaces based on steel stretching...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rockbolting</b> {{telltales}} are now {{an internationally}} established means of providing preemptive warnings of roof falls. The dual height telltale, providing an immediate visible measurement distinguishing between movement {{above and below}} the rockbolted height, is the most widespread version. The dual height telltale was first developed by British Coal in the early 19902 ̆ 7 s as <b>rockbolting</b> was introduced to replace steel arch support and the success of this support system in deep coal mines has been widely ascribed to the use of this safety device. Since its adoption, many permutations and improvements on the basic design have been developed and applied worldwide to suit different mining circumstances; for instance, triple height telltales are commonly used where a combination of roofbolts and longer tendons are installed at the face of the heading. The choice of appropriate movement action levels is vital for safety. Experience has also shown that systematic management of the application of the telltale warning system is required to ensure that appropriate action (usually the installation of additional support) is taken in time when action levels are exceeded. In Australia, this is exemplified in the TARP approach. Another major development has been an intrinsically safe remote reading dual height telltale system which allows up to 100 electronic telltales to be connected with a twin core cable and read, using either a portable readout, {{from the end of the}} roadway, or a surface PC via a telephone cable connection. In the latter configuration, a real time display of roof condition is obtained whilst retaining the immediate visual indication underground. A recent development is the “Autowarning” telltale. This provides a warning of impending goafing in depillaring operations via high visibility, flashing LEDs. The paper describes these and other telltale developments and provides case histories of their application worldwide, including UK, India, and USA...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{interlock}} is {{an important}} component in load transfer capacity in the <b>rockbolting</b> system. It is in turn dominated by the rebar bolt profile configuration. To gain a deeper understanding of their interactions, rebar bolt units under axial loading were studied. Two kinds of failure mode have been identified, namely parallel shear and dilational slip failures. Based on some assumptions made, a universal upper limit of slipping angle of dilation slip failure can be found as the complementary angle of the grout material internal friction angle, which is also the minimum value of the bolt rib face angle. This theory can explain similar performances of rock bolts in pull-out tests while their face angles are large. In addition, once the geometric parameters of a rebar bolt profile are provided, more narrow slip angles range can be figured out via simple plots. As a result, the grout between the bolt profiles can be recognised as three sections, one works as part of the bolt profile, one carries out shear failure and the bottom part keeps intact...|$|E
40|$|This study aims at {{evaluating}} the likely effect of high stress regime within the rocks of the Birimian Supergroup of Ghana, dated middle Precambrian and offer remediation strategies. The stress levels were therefore assessed between 26 -level to 50 -levels (i. e., 755 to 1500 m deep) within the deepest {{mine in the}} formation. Results indicated that pre-and-post mining stresses levels were 75 and 200 MPa, respectively. These levels are quite high and could induce stress related instabilities. Fundamental studies of failure behaviour of the rockmass show that elevated stress regime of this kind poses great potential for eminent rock bursting within the Birimian. Such situations demand concerted efforts of strategic mine design measures, including modified excavation geometry and destressing or preconditioning. These methods could be exploited to extend the normal zone of stress induced fractured rock to a greater depth ahead of the excavation face. Support could be improved further by adopting higher <b>rockbolting</b> density or tougher mesh together with shortcrete. If the excavation becomes prone to moderate rockbursting, provision of appropriate support structure can also be made either to limit the bulking process or reduce excessive rock deformation...|$|E
40|$|A large {{proportion}} of reinforcing elements in jointed rock mass can fail in shear. In the deep mines and rockburst-prone conditions, the bending and shear failure of <b>rockbolts</b> is also prevalent. This phenomenon has drawn greater attention and corresponding {{research has been conducted}} to investigate the shear performance of <b>rockbolts.</b> Nevertheless, the load transfer mechanism and the interaction between the <b>rockbolts</b> and rock mass were still not fully understood. Knowing both static and dynamic shear capacity of <b>rockbolts</b> and support systems is highly required to design the underground support rationally. The aim of this research is to provide a detailed analysis of shear behaviour of <b>rockbolts</b> using the laboratory tests and numerical modelling method approaches. <b>Rockbolt</b> and rock interaction, particularly near the shear joints, was investigated in this research. Four main parts were included in this thesis: static loading tests, numerical simulation under the static loading, dynamic loading tests, and numerical simulation under dynamic loading. A double shearing test (DST) system was used to examine the performance of <b>rockbolt</b> shearing. Testing was undertaken on certain strength concrete to simulate the rock mass. The laboratory test results reveal that rock strength, <b>rockbolt</b> diameters and installation angle, all affect the shear resistance of DST system by analysing the shear load-displacement relationships and the energy absorption abilities. It was found that <b>rockbolts</b> can increase the tension and shear properties of the surrounding rock mass. By comparing the DST results under static and dynamic loading conditions, {{it was found that the}} energy absorption ability of <b>rockbolts</b> is lower than under static loading condition. Thus, the dynamic performance of <b>rockbolt</b> is slight different with the static performance, which needs caution during the design of underground support in rockburst-prone condition. The numerical modelling technique was adopted to obtain the stress and strain developed along the bolt and surrounding materials under the shear load. FLAC 3 D was used for the static double shear tests, and ABAQUS Explicit was used for dynamic double shear tests. Parametric studies were investigated by the numerical simulation methods. This compensated the disadvantage of laboratory study, and could determine the commonly-used size of <b>rockbolt</b> performance that was not achieved in a laboratory study...|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University, 15 / 03 / 1999. In tunnel excavation, the use of <b>rockbolts</b> {{has long been a}} popular means of reinforcement in rock masses to prevent the rock opening from caving in. The idea has evolved from the earliest form of <b>rockbolt</b> made of wood to the more up-to-date form of pre-tensioned or grouted steel <b>rockbolts.</b> A major breakthrough in the design of <b>rockbolt</b> models was made by Aydan (1989). This <b>rockbolt</b> element was modelled in coupled form, with one sub-element representing the steel bolt, and the other sub-element the grout. This representation was necessary to model the complex action in the continuous rock mass near the joint. In elasticity problems, the large displacement formulation of a beam element is derived from the fundamental theory, and the bending phenomenon of a thin rod is analysed by the finite element discretizations of the bar elements and the beam elements. Experiments show that the deformation characteristics of the latter representation resemble a more realistic life behaviour. Based on this finding, this thesis proposes a modification to Aydan's two-dimensional <b>rockbolt</b> element, with the beam elements discretising the steel bolt. The different mechanical responses of a perfectly elastic <b>rockbolt</b> are considered, and the large displacement formulation of the new <b>rockbolt</b> element is derived by combining those of Aydan's <b>rockbolt</b> element and the beam element. The mechanics of the Aydan element and the new <b>rockbolt</b> element are described, and their performances are compared in an identical situation. It is found that in the two two-dimensional examples used in this thesis, the modified element ensures the continuity of curvature of the <b>rockbolt,</b> and in general, can act as support across a discontinuity or joint between rock masses well. In conjunction with the displacement method in the finite element procedures, a conventional iteration solution procedure is first described to solve the nonlinear incremental stiffness equation. However, it is found that this procedure is cumbersome, and requires a large amount of comptutations. Some limited storage quasi-Newton minimization algorithms are considered as an alternative...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rockbolts</b> {{have become}} a popular {{technique}} for reinforcing rock mass {{all over the world}} as they are very effective and simple to install. <b>Rockbolts</b> are installed to reinforce fractured rock mass by resisting dilation and shear movement along the fractures. Several <b>rockbolts</b> can create a reinforced zone in fractured rock mass to improve the self-supporting capacity of rock. When the bolted rock mass deforms, load transfer occurs between the bolt and the rock. The grouted steel rebar is the most commonly used reinforcement system, using resins or cement grouts as an anchorage. Better understanding of the bolt load transfer mechanism leads to optimisation of the bolt profile design that can significantly improve the performance of the <b>rockbolt</b> reinforcement system. Historically, analytical models predicting the load distribution along the bolt subjected to tensile loading were proposed however, there were limitations in the available theories, requiring improvements. This thesis uses a combination of approaches involving laboratory tests, together with analytical and numerical models to propose new understanding of the <b>rockbolt</b> load transfer mechanism, aiming to optimise bolt design for ground support and improve rock mass reinforcement. In this thesis, laboratory push tests were conducted on 100 mm long <b>rockbolt</b> sections grouted in steel tubes with the objective of studying the factors influencing the load transfer capacity of <b>rockbolts.</b> Resin has a key role in activating the mechanical interlocking mechanism of bolt to resin or resin to borehole interface and hence, resin strength was studied. Two new analytical models are proposed here. The first analytical model of fully grouted <b>rockbolts</b> loaded in tension uses the non-linear bond-slip relationship describing the mechanical interaction at the bolt-grout interface. Derived equations of the loaddisplacement profile, shear stress distribution at the bolt-resin interface and axial load distribution in the bolt are given here. These equations were subsequently validated with experimental results from both the laboratory and in situ studies. The second analytical model considers the difference in behaviour between fully grouted bolts with and without the bolt free end slip when loaded in tension. This model validated by experimental data aims to predict the stress distribution of fully grouted bolts installed in weak strata where the bolt experiences free end slip. By taking the bolt free end slip into consideration, the shear and axial load distribution along the bolt can be accurately predicted. Numerical studies using the Fast Lagrangian Analysis of Continua (FLAC) software were undertaken to further validate the bolt-grout bond-slip behaviour. A new approach of non-linear bond-slip relationship embedded into <b>rockbolt</b> elements was used to realistically model the bolt-resin load transfer and displacement profiles. This was achieved by writing the subroutine within FLAC using the programming language FISH. Fully grouted <b>rockbolts</b> subjected to tensile load with and without free end slip were modelled showing a close match with the experimental results in terms of loaddisplacement relationship, <b>rockbolt</b> axial force distribution and interfacial shear stress distribution. A mine roadway reinforced by fully grouted <b>rockbolts</b> was modelled using FLAC. Interaction between the <b>rockbolts</b> and the rock mass was studied using a numerical modelling approach with the <b>rockbolt</b> elements modified by the FISH subroutine. <b>Rockbolt</b> properties are characterised by the bond-slip relationship of the bolt-grout interface or grout-rock interface, which can be determined by pull or push tests of short <b>rockbolt</b> sections. Numerous 100 mm long bolt sections were push tested and the results implemented in the FLAC model. The interaction between <b>rockbolts</b> and rock mass subject to various stress state, rock mass quality and the presence of rock fractures or joints, was studied and the results are reported here. This new methodology provides engineers with valuable tools to understand the axial behaviour of the <b>rockbolts</b> installed in the field...|$|R
40|$|Rapid {{advances}} in rock bolting technology {{over the past}} four decades have firmly established the usage of rock bolts as the primary rock reinforcement system in underground mine support design. Experimental studies have confirmed that bolt surface profile plays an important role on load transfer of fully grouted <b>rockbolting</b> systems. However, there are no related theories nor mechanical models to explain these experimental observations and to identify the role of bolt profile in the load transfer mechanisms. In traditional <b>rockbolting</b> mechanism studies, the shear resistance caused by the bolt profile reacting with surrounding materials is termed “mechanical interlock” of the system. The effect of the mechanical interlock is integrated into proposed load transfer models by various manners, such as zigzag dilation, supposed shear stress-displacement behaviour, or supposed shear stress-strain behaviour. The interaction between the bolt rib profile and surrounding mediums, which is the origin of mechanical interlock, is ignored in all analytical approaches. This research work provides a fundamental understanding {{of the role of the}} bolt profile and its influence on rock bolting failure. In addition, the research outcomes provide theoretical support for achieving optimum bolt design in engineering applications. A series of experimental studies were undertaken to identify the interactions between the bolt profile and the resin under axial or lateral loading. Accordingly, the failure modes of the resin around a bolt profile have been classified into two categories: “parallel shear failure” and “dilational slip failure”. Parallel shear failure of the resin is characterised by a cylinder failure surface, which just passes through the tips of the bolt profiles. It occurs if the bolt has closely spaced profiles, or is confined by high radial stiffness materials. Dilational slip failure is characterised by lodged resin in front of the bolt profile forming a conical shaped failure surface. It occurs in lower confinement stiffness (soft rock) or when rib spacing is large. An achievement of this research work was to formulate dilational slip failure of rock bolting. The governing equation for this kind of failure mode has been derived as: F = π(R 2 - r 2) [cos φ/sin(i) • cos(i+φ) • c + tan(i+φ) /sin(i) • p] Where F is bolt axial load when failure occurs, R and r are bolt rib geometrical parameters, c and φ are the mechanical properties of the grouting material, i is dilational slip face angle and p is radial pressure. Once the dilational slip face angle, i, is acknowledged, the influence of bolt profile geometry on rock bolting failure can be analytically evaluated. The domain of dilational slip face angle, which is different to bolt rib face angle, can be estimated by derived equation: sin(φ+ 2 i) ≥ R 2 -r 2 /RL cosφ + sinφ Where L is the rib geometric parameter. In addition, the most vulnerable surface of dilational slip failure has also been predicted. Consequently, the influence of the bolt profile in load transfer mechanism of <b>rockbolting</b> system can be predicted using the governing equation of dilational slip failure mode. Furthermore, the direct parallel shear failure of rock bolting has been investigated using a stress analysis method. The stress field within the resin annulus introduced by the axial load of the bolt has been formulated based on the half space theory. That is, parallel shear failure will occur if: T 0 = F/π(G 2 -G 1 tanφ) Where: T 0 = the initial shear resistance of the failure surface; G 1 = (sinθ - sin 2 θ) [m(π - θ - γ) + ksinθ + ycosθ] + (cos 2 θ + sin 22 θ) γsinθ +ksin 2 θ(2 sinθsin 2 θ - 1) + 2 sin 2 θ(kcosθ - km + m lnm - γsinθ) G 2 = γsinθ(sinθ - sin 2 θcos 2 θ) + cos 2 θ[m(π - θ - γ) + ksinθ + γcosθ] + ksinθcos 22 θ - sin 2 θcosθ(kcosθ - km + m lnm - γsinθ) θ is bolt rib face angle k, m and γ are geometric parameters of the bolt profile Parametric studies of the bolt profile have also been undertaken. Results show that smaller rib face angle or smaller profile height to length ratio bolts are favourable to transfer load radially. Hence, they should be used in hard rock environments. Large rib face angle with higher rib height to length ratio bolts will transfer the major part of axial load into the resin annulus at a direction parallel to the bolt axis. They should be used in soft rock conditions...|$|E

40|$|Premature {{failure of}} <b>rockbolts</b> from stress {{corrosion}} cracking (SCC) {{has been a problem}} in a limited number of Australian coal mines since into the late 1990 ’s. Laboratory research into the susceptibility of different steel grades to SCC has been inconclusive with conflicting results where failure could only be achieved in highly acid solutions. Based on anecdotal field evidence, the industry moved to adopting a HSAC 840 grade steel having a higher impact toughness of 16 J being more than double that used previously. After several years, mines began reporting significant numbers of failed HSAC 840 <b>rockbolts.</b> The industry sought answers that would address the underlying causes. Around 200 broken <b>rockbolts</b> were collected from across a range of underground coal mines in New South Wales and Queensland. The steel grade of the majority of <b>rockbolt</b> was found to be HSAC 840. It was found that SCC was the dominant failure mode, but localised pitting corrosion often occurred at the same locations. Underground studies were completed using survey and non-destructive test methods {{to determine the extent of}} the problem. It was found that only two mines had significant problems and they became the focus of further research. Groundwater dripping from <b>rockbolts</b> was collected for analysis from 12 mine sites. Mine groundwater with a DIN 50929 corrosivity classification of medium to high corresponded with a limited number of broken bolts, but the groundwater from the two mines with significant problems was not rated corrosive. Claystone mineralogy showed no swelling clays, however they were prone to softening with exposure to water to seal off around <b>rockbolts</b> to retain moisture. Microbiological testing of the groundwater indicated the presence of bacteria that has a known influence on steel corrosion. An in-hole <b>rockbolt</b> coupon was designed for in-situ testing. The unique design allows the coupon to fit inside a borehole exposing it to the same environment as an installed <b>rockbolt.</b> The in-hole coupon experiments were successful in achieving SCC together with localised pitting along the surface of the <b>rockbolt</b> which is a world’s first. Testing of the surface crust formed on coupons that had been exposed for up to 566 days revealed sulphate reducing bacteria in significant concentrations. These results provide the best evidence to date that SCC may be caused by hydrogen embrittlement resulting from the action of hydrogen sulphide producing bacteria...|$|R
40|$|Stress Corrosion Cracking (SCC) is {{a failure}} {{mechanism}} which has been observed to affect <b>rockbolts</b> installed {{in a number of}} Australian and overseas underground mines. SCC requires the application of a tensile stress on a material placed in an appropriately corrosive environment. SCC is characterised by the growth of fine fractures, originating from the surface of a material, which will continue to grow until they reach a critical length at which the material fails by mechanical overload. An extensive literature survey into <b>rockbolt</b> corrosion and SCC identified the need for a dedicated testing system for investigating SCC in full-scale <b>rockbolt</b> specimens. This thesis has focused on the design and development such a testing system. This system included a novel testing methodology, the Bending and Tension Loading Apparatus (BaTLA), which was housed within a Controlled Mine Environment (CME) laboratory, capable of recreating the atmospheric conditions present in an underground mine, as well as conduncting ‘accelerated’ tests using synthetic testing solutions. The development of this laboratory was based on the findings of a detailed field study conducted to characterise the geological, geotechnical, hydrological and atmospheric environment of two underground coal mines which have presented cases of <b>rockbolt</b> SCC. This newly developed laboratory was used to carry out an extensive testing program consisting of over 40, 000 hours worth of experimentation. This extensive testing program assessed the performance of both bending and tension loading in the BaTLA for investigating SCC in <b>rockbolts.</b> Both static and Slow Strain Rate (SSR) loading conditions were examined and each were found to be useful for investigating specific aspects of SCC. It was found that static testing provided the most appropriate means for examining mechanistic aspects of <b>rockbolt</b> SCC such as critical stress threshold, while SSR testing was found to be better suited to comparing material and environmental factors. A comparison of a number of steel grades and finishing treatments showed that lower strength 300 grade steel was far more resilient to SCC than both 1355 and HSAC 840 steel, and that surface treatments such as galvanising and grit blasting both provided notable improvements to a <b>rockbolt’s</b> SCC resilience. The testing program has also utilised small, representative coupon specimens. The coupon specimens used included the standard ASTM International G 39 bent beam specimen and a slotted split pin specimen. A comparison of <b>rockbolt</b> steel grades finishing treatments using slotted specimens revealed that 1355 grade steel is much more susceptible to SCC than HSAC 840 grade steel, and that galvanising provided a significant improvement in SCC resilience. The ASTM G 39 coupon specimens were used to examine critical stress thresholds for SCC and it was found that <b>rockbolt</b> steel may be susceptible to SCC at stresses as low as 580 MPa. Secondary testing carried out by calculating the plastic strain experienced by <b>rockbolts</b> at failure by examining their rib profile supported this observation of a low critical stress threshold, showing that a large proportion of in-situ <b>rockbolts</b> experienced SCC failure at, or slightly above their yield strength...|$|R
40|$|The {{displacements}} and stresses in {{layered rock}} above underground openings {{can be calculated}} using a beam model for the rock layers. The traditional approach assumes that interfaces between layers are frictionless and layers can slip past one another freely as they deflect. In contrast, the design of structural laminated beams has traditionally been {{based on the assumption}} that the interfaces between layers were welded, with no slip occurring there. In this work, the theory of composite laminated beams, which allows for partial slip on layer interfaces, is applied to the problem of predicting displacements and stresses in layered roof rock. The effects of <b>rockbolt</b> reinforcement are modeled by discrete shear and normal stiffnesses incorporated at locations in the model where the <b>rockbolts</b> cross layer interfaces. Published solutions and results for laminated composite beams are reviewed. Composite laminated beam theory provided a means of accounting for <b>rockbolt</b> reinforcement effects and provided a conceptual framework that was used to develop two FORTRAN programs; one, based on the force method of analysis, that automatically finds shear and tensile interface failures in the system, and the other a finite element program that employs beam elements, elastic interface elements, and <b>rockbolt</b> elements to model a <b>rockbolted</b> layered rock system. Published data together with results from these programs suggest that shear reinforcement may be more effective when placed near the ends of roof layers. The normal interaction between layers tends to be uniformly distributed unless <b>rockbolt</b> forces act on the layers or if partial delamination of layers has occurred. Both shear and normal reinforcement will cause stresses to be redistributed within the system of layers. Analysis of this redistribution of stresses requires that the sequence of interface failure be predicted which, in turn, requires that the properties of the individual layers, of the interfaces between layers, and of the <b>rockbolts</b> be properly taken into account. Laminated composite beam theory and programs based on this theory provide rational and efficient ways to study and analyze the behavior of layered roof rock...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, two new {{analytical}} {{approaches are}} presented {{on the basis}} of convergence-confinement method to compute both the ultimate convergence of circular tunnel and its plastic zone having been reinforced by systematically pre-tensioned fully grouted <b>rockbolts.</b> The models have two basic assumptions: (1) the grouted <b>rockbolts</b> increase the radial internal pressure within a broken rock mass by both the pre-tensioned force and the probable following induced force due to rock mass movement (2) tunnel convergence (specially short-term) occurs only due to reducing and diminishing of the radial constrained stress on tunnel surface provided by the working face. Hence, the values of both the pre-tensioned pressure and the mentioned radial constrained stress are specially taken into consideration in this paper. That is, according to their magnitudes, two different conditions occur: the magnitude of pre-tensioned pressure is greater than that of the constrained stress at bolt installation time and vice versa. The solutions are extended to each of conditions, and illustrative examples are solved. The proposed approaches predicting almost identical results show that pre-tensioning of grouted <b>rockbolts</b> will increase the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>rockbolts...</b>|$|R

40|$|Rock {{reinforcing}} elements {{provide a}} significant proportion of their ground control capability through offering resistance to shear movement of adjacent rock masses or blocks. This potential shear movement may take the form of sliding on horizontal bedding planes leading to strata bending; or block displacement along other geological structures such as joints or similar discontinuities. Much has been reported about this type of behaviour of rock bolts and other tendons, in theoretical concepts. However, {{there is a shortage of}} quality data available on the exact nature of this mechanism for shear resistance, and the role played by parameters such as pre-tensioning. A clearer understanding of the nature and significance of this type of behaviour has major implications for rock reinforcing materials and installation design. This thesis, which was supported by the Australian Coal Research Program (ACARP) describes the design, construction and commissioning of a laboratory testing facility at the School of Mining Engineering, University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia and a subsequent testing program. The single failure plane design adopted in the test rig has been successful in allowing shear loading to be directly applied to fully installed <b>rockbolts.</b> <b>Rockbolts</b> were installed into an offset concrete rockmass, which consisted of two separate concrete samples that created a smooth shear plane surface. The reinforced samples were subjected to an applied shear load and critical parameters such as load and shear displacement were recorded. Influencing parameters such as concrete strength and applied pre-tension were altered and recorded to determine their effects on the overall shear performance of the sample. The failure mode of the <b>rockbolts</b> was also examined. The results indicate that a relative stronger rockmass material caused the <b>rockbolt</b> to fail within a lower shear displacement compared to a relatively weaker material. Also, a pre-tensioned <b>rockbolt</b> tended to resist shear displacement at least initially, until high shear loads developed. This phenomena is beneficial to ground support as less movement would tend to maintain integral strength of the rockmass. The use of strain-gauged <b>rockbolts</b> indicated as would be expected that the shear loading arrangement induced a compressive axial loading that tended to dissipate with distance from the shear surface...|$|R
40|$|The Fully Encapsulated Resin Bolt (FERB) {{is widely}} {{utilised}} for strata control and ground support in civil and mining applications worldwide, with approximately 6 million installed per annum by the Australian coal mining industry. Independent studies {{have concluded that}} 30 - 35 % of these <b>rockbolts,</b> which represents an annual expenditure of $ 40 million, are ineffective. The anchorage and failure mechanisms of FERB are yet to be quantified, and support systems are designed primarily from empirical rather than scientific methods. There are no standardised methods of assessing FERB components, installation techniques and support behaviour. The majority of research into FERB support systems remains commercial intellectual property, with little information released into the public domain. This thesis investigated several variables of FERB support systems, and also examined differences between field and laboratory pull-out test load distributions. This research was conducted in two phases, with Phase 1 seeking standardised methodology and repeatability in results, while Phase 2 further refined Phase 1 methods and extended the range of tests. The results in both phases were encouraging, with reasonable repeatability attained in all testing series. The findings included: 	Annulus Thickness: There was little change in load capacity with small annulus thickness, however the maximum peak load (MPL) significantly reduced once annulus thickness exceeded 4 mm. 	Resin Installation Spin Time: Underspinning of cartridge resin {{was found to have}} an insignificant effect on <b>rockbolt</b> load/deformation characteristics. Overspinning, however, led to a dramatic reduction in anchorage performance with a lessening in both MPL and stiffness 	<b>Rockbolt</b> Load Transfer: The magnitude of an applied load reduced to zero {{along the length of the}} <b>rockbolt,</b> being greatest nearest the rock free surface (the point of load application). An exponential reduction was found when tested in the manner of laboratory tests, with the loading jack reacting against the free surface. This reduction was linear when the load was applied as in the field, with no load placed on the free surface This basic investigation into FERB support systems has validated many empirical understandings of <b>rockbolts,</b> while highlighting the need for further testing into several key areas...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{assessment}} of support {{systems such as}} <b>rockbolts</b> and rock anchors are {{very important for the}} maintenance of existing rock-engineering structures. The utilization of non-destructive tests is preferable to destructive tests such as pullout tests. The dynamic responses of rock anchors and <b>rockbolts</b> could be used for non-destructive tests. These tests should generally provide some information on the constructional conditions, corrosion and axial force conditions. In {{the first part of this}} study, some theoretical models are developed for the axial and trasverse dynamic tests and then results of numerical simulations are presented by considering possible conditions in-situ. These conditions are the bonding quality, the existence of corroded parts or couplers and pre-stress. The results of the numerical simulations could be very valuable for interpretation of the wave responses to be measured in non-destructive dynamic tests in-situ. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} applies the {{numerical}} manifold method (NMM) {{as a tool}} to investigate the rockfall hazard in underground engineering. The crack evolution technique with crack initiation and propagation criterion, which has been successfully applied to handle cracking problems in rocks, is used in this study. A <b>rockbolt</b> element is introduced, which is first validated by a simple case. The mechanism of the <b>rockbolt</b> in reinforcing a layered rock mass is then investigated through a four-layered rock beam example. The developed NMM is then used to investigate the rockfall instability caused by either natural joints or mining induced fractures in an underground power station house or a tunnel. The results illustrate that the developed NMM can not only capture the entire dynamic process of the rockfall but also locate the keyblock successfully. As such, corresponding reinforcement methods can be chosen reasonably. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Resin bolt parameters, such as back {{pressure}} and gloving, and {{their effect on}} ground support system performance, {{remains one of the}} fundamental areas of <b>rockbolt</b> research. The majority of previous studies into resin bolting parameters have utilised various methodologies to investigate the effect of a singular parameter. Unfortunately, due to the variability in methodologies and the relatively narrow field of study of each research project, a holistic conclusion into the exact science behind various results is unable to be drawn. It is the focus of this research project to conduct a detailed and consistent testing program, which attempts to simulate real world conditions as closely as possible, in order to provide the industry with engineered roof bolting solutions to specific underground roof properties. Recently published studies have implemented steel piping as a simulated borehole and have reported relatively high back-pressure measurements. As part of this project, testing conducted both underground and in a cement block, have recorded back-pressures in the range of 4 - 10 MPa, which are substantially lower than previous tests conducted in steel piping. <b>Rockbolts</b> installed in an underground coal mine using a continuous miner have been over-cored, the core has been cut into 100 mm lengths and each sample has been push tested. After push testing, the samples from the top 300 mm of each bolt were inspected for gloving. Almost all of the recovered <b>rockbolts</b> experienced some degree of gloving within the top 300 mm of its length. The average severity of gloving within these specimens was found to be relatively minor. It was found that gloving can reduce load transfer by 4 - 6 kN per 10 % of gloved surface area...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} analysis {{has been developed}} {{for the design of}} ungrouted tensioned <b>rockbolts</b> as support of excavations under axisymmetric conditions. The bolts dimensions (length, cross-section, longitudinal and circumferential spacings), their stiffness, their pre-tension load and the delay of installation are taken into account. Moreover, the method effects three main improvements in the usual theory, taking into consideration: 1. the reaction force transferred to the rock mass in the bolts anchoring zone, 2. the elastic recompression of the carrying ring surrounding the excavation due to the bolts preload, and 3. the relative displacement of the bolts ends which has a repercussion on their tension. Since the usual rock-support interaction analysis is only available when the rock mass and the support behave independently, an alternative solution has been explored for the bolting system (since it cannot be considered as an internal support). It consists to include the effect of the <b>rockbolts</b> into the ground reaction curve. In this paper, the principles of the analysis are explained and a numerical application is taken...|$|R

Their mechanical behavior under tensile loads is reviewed theoretically and experimentally. As for the theoretical part, a new solution {{able to predict}} the full range behavior of a grouted bolt subjected to a pull-out test is explained. The originality of the new approach {{lies in the fact}} that the boundary conditions only concern the free end of the bolt. The experimental part consists of a wide pull-out test campaign performed in laboratory on deformed steel bars and on FRP <b>rockbolts.</b> These tests have been carried out using a new experimental bench, whose main assets will be described. The influence of several parameters such as the confining pressure, the bolt profile and the quality of the grouting material has been considered.
