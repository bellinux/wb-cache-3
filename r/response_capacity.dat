The appeal raised $217,498 (1999 CHF) to supply hygiene items, household goods, water purification tablets, and water containers to the 12,000 living in temporary shelters. The appeal asked for repair supplies {{and to improve}} the <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> of the national society for future disasters. The Cuban Red Cross mobilized over 4,500 volunteers to the affected areas to provide first aid to injured, distribute meals and medical supplies, and collaborate with blood banks.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} is to explore the nature of the response relation in online learning networks. We ask whether actors choose their response partners at random or whether certain special mechanisms are at work. We compare the observed values of clustering of responses in 95 online learning networks with the predictions of two suitable Random Graph models. All the online distance learning networks exhibit clustering that is incompatible with the random choices of response partners, with no constraints on the <b>response</b> <b>capacities</b> of actors. But the observed clustering in all networks is compatible with the random choices of response partners subject to constraints on their total <b>response</b> <b>capacities.</b> We provide a possible explanation for this behavior, based on the nature and goal of the online learning networks, and discuss the practical implications for online distance education...|$|R

On 14 January, it was reported {{there had been a}} fatality linked to the Ebola virus. The case occurred in the Tonkolili district. Prior to this case WHO had advised, [...] "we anticipate more flare-ups and must be prepared for them... massive effort is underway to ensure robust prevention, surveillance and <b>response</b> <b>capacity</b> across all three countries by the end of March." [...] On 16 January, it was reported that the woman who died of the virus may have exposed several individuals; the government announced that 100 people had been quarantined. On the same day, WHO released a statement, indicating that originally the 90-day enhanced surveillance period was to end on 5 February. Investigations indicate the female case was a student at Lunsar in Port Loko district, who had gone to Kambia district on December the 28th until returning symptomatic. Bombali district was visited by the individual, for consultation with an herbalist, later going to a government hospital in Magburaka. WHO indicates there are 109 contacts, 28 of which are high risk, furthermore, there are three missing contacts.The source or route of transmission which caused the fatality is still unknown. A second new case was confirmed on 20 January; the patient had contact with the previous fatality. On 17 March, the WHO declared the country Ebola-free.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} the existence of reciprocity in online learning networks. We analyzed the response relations between participants in 75 online learning networks at the Open University of Israel. Specifically, we asked whether the observed reciprocity of responses can be explained by random selection of partners to respond to, or whether a reciprocal selection process of partners is at work. The observed reciprocities were compared with a base line network model in which responses are random, subject only to the constraint that the total <b>response</b> <b>capacities</b> of actors are fixed. The expected values of reciprocities for the baseline model were computed by simulation. In all 75 online learning networks, the observed reciprocities significantly deviate from the expected values. The implication is that reciprocal selection processes are at work in online learning networks. The selection processes cannot be described in terms of the <b>response</b> <b>capacities</b> of actors; other factors are required to fully capture the nature of these processes. We discuss a possible theoretical explanation for reciprocity in online networks, based on its broadcast nature, and practical implications for online collaborative learning...|$|R

30|$|In the 10  years {{following}} {{the adoption of}} the Hyogo Framework for Action (2005 – 2015): Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters (HFA) (UNISDR 2005), we have witnessed an acceleration in the formulation and implementation of policies and measures whose goals envisage reducing the risk related to natural hazards (phenomena or events). These polices are frequently complemented with multiple actions that include awareness-raising campaigns, risk assessments, early warning systems, emergency <b>response</b> <b>capacities,</b> and so on. At national and local levels, most countries, have developed legislation, policies, programs, and projects to address the increasing disaster risk threat to humanity.|$|R
