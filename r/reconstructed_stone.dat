50|$|Borthwick Castle {{is built}} as a double tower, 74 ft long, 68 ft in breadth and 90 ft high. The castle is on a small hill {{surrounded}} by a stream.Apart from the large cannon scar on one face, the walls, built of fine sandstone ashlar, are virtually complete, and very unusually, none of the original narrow windows have been enlarged. The battlements, however, no longer survive to their original height, having lost their stepped crenelations. They are carried on massive projecting corbels with corner roundels. The tower has two doorways, both unaltered and round headed. One at ground level leads into the partly subterranean kitchen and storage vaults. The second is directly above it at first-floor level, and leads directly into the stone-vaulted great hall. It is approached by a <b>reconstructed</b> <b>stone</b> bridge.|$|E

50|$|Walnut Hill (Pawlings Farm): The land {{known as}} the Perkiomen Peninsula, and {{particularly}} the Pawling Farm, played {{an essential role in}} the Valley Forge winter encampment of 1777-1778. It provided strategic protection for the camp; it was the site of the newly organized Commissary function that saved the Continental Army from starvation; and it was the ultimate site of the encampment itself before the army marched on to victory at Monmouth. Today the peninsula is a mix of habitats—open meadow, riparian and upland forest, wetlands and extensive vernal ponds. This is why the Pawling Farm lands provide the best wildlife habitat in the entire 3500 acre park. The park’s unpaved River Trail runs from the Pawling Bridge to Betzwood, and is a favorite of local residents. The paved Schuylkill River Trail runs along the northern edge of the Pawling Farm. Located {{on the south side of}} Apple Valley Lane is a <b>reconstructed</b> <b>stone</b> wall (commissioned by David Lapps and Eileen Moran) from one of the original structures that some of the troops stayed in during the winter of 1777-1778.|$|E
40|$|Tijekom rujna 2012. izvršena je digitalna dokumentacija dijela helenističkog bedema antičkog Epetiona, na sjeveroistočnoj strani modernog Stobreča. Prethodno su tijekom veljače izvršena probna geofizička ispitivanja na prostoru ispred i iza spomenutog dijela bedema (izvan i unutar gabarita helenističkog grada). The ancient Issaean small urban {{settlement}} of Epetion (modern Stobreč) {{was founded on}} the mainland of the East Adriatic coast, in the 3 rd century BC. Possibly it {{played a role in}} transference of the Greek cultural traits further into the mainland, probably along with Issaean products, wherein lies its importance. Epetion emerged on a peninsula (4. 5 ha), that was soon encircled and protected with the city fortification. The remains of these walls are nowadays visible only on the north-east side of the peninsula, where one stone row still lies reconstructed above the terrain level. Epetion was never the subject of systematic archaeological research. In September 2012, the cooperation of the Institute of Archaeology from Zagreb and the Institut für Archäologie der Karl-Franzens-Universität Graz led to short investigations {{in the area of the}} visible Hellenistic fortification on the north-eastern side of the Stobreč peninsula. As a part of preparatory work in February 2012, in collaboration with the Institute for Geography and Regional Science Graz (IGR), a non-destructive method (GPR) was used to investigate the area inside and outside of the remains of the Northern fortification walls. The primary focus in the first year was on the digital and up-to-date documentation of the Hellenistic fortification. The two main questions were whether the original fortification was preserved below the <b>reconstructed</b> <b>stone</b> line, and the actual state it was in. Two trenches were opened, one outside the fortification walls, on the western part of the parcel, and the other one between the clay-filled, double-faced ashlar masonry wall. In the trench in front of the fortification walls stratigraphy of the layers documented the site formation process (SU 1 - 10). All layers had mixed material dating from the Late Iron Age up to the present day, mostly findings from the ancient period. SU 7 was defined as the trench for levelling the terrain. The results showed that the Hellenistic fortification was preserved in situ, exactly below the reconstructed part, below the modern terrain level. The exterior and interior facings of the Epetion Hellenistic fortification were built from big stone blocks, without bindings. The width of the Hellenistic fortification varies between 3, 20 m to 3, 40 m. The exterior facing of Epetion´s clay-filled, double-faced ashlar masonry wall is well preserved, and on this part so far documented up to 2 m in depth...|$|E

40|$|This article reads a {{photographic}} studio {{and the visual}} archive compiled therein of the stone town of Zanzibar City. Capital Art Studio is analysed as negotiating the fraught interface between the Indian Ocean world and continental Africa in both the 1950 s and again after the revolution in nationalist and neoliberal eras. The article explores {{the ways in which}} the studio produces discrepant temporalities to both the heritage industry currently <b>reconstructing</b> <b>Stone</b> Town and that emerging from other photographic studios of the postcolonial world, which extend surfaces for ludic forms of self-fashioning by which their subjects. In striking contrast, Capital Art Studio articulates a visual idiom that re-calls a time in which Zanzibar was an ‘island metropolis’ while simultaneously refusing the heritage industry’s consignment of this time to the past. This articulation and refusal is rendered through a visual idiom of transport or in the re-presentation of Stone Town as melancholy palimpsest. Both convey into a present framed by a neoliberal global order a past that was ambivalently both cosmopolitan and commodifying. Meg Samuelso...|$|R
