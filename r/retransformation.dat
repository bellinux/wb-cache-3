Doctor Octopus's genetic guesswork for Osborn results in a living armor that always needs a host. After discovering Harry's connection to the symbiote, Norman gets intrigued by his son's new abilities as Venom. Norman appears in the two-part season finale ("Revealed" [...] and [...] "Rise of the Goblin"). Osborn conducts a plan to lure Spider-Man to Oscorp. As he reveals his master plans to Spider-Man, Doc Ock betrays Norman by injecting him with a serum mixed with both Spider-Man's and Venom's DNA, resulting in Norman's transformation into a large, green-skinned, goblin-esque monster. At first, he is only a savage beast, intent on destroying everything in his path, including Doc Ock and the S.H.I.E.L.D. Trainees, but the Green Goblin gradually begins to regain intelligence. The smart yet psychopathic Goblin rampages through the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier, obtaining his gilder and electric gauntlets from stolen S.H.I.E.L.D. technology and causing both Harry's <b>retransformation</b> into Venom and a fatal injury towards Curt Connors's arm.

Unlike other approaches suggested recently that require <b>retransformations</b> or arbitrary assumptions about error distributions, our estimation strategy uses sequences of conditional probability functions, {{similar to those}} used in discrete time hazard rate analyses, to construct a discrete approximation to the density function of the outcome of interest conditional on exogenous explanatory variables.

In this Critical Review, we evaluated factors influencing observed removal efficiencies of three antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline) in pilot- and full-scale biological treatment systems. Factors assessed include (i) <b>retransformation</b> to parent pharmaceuticals from e. g., conjugated metabolites and analogues, (ii) solid retention time (SRT), (iii) fractions sorbed onto solids, and (iv) dynamics in influent and effluent loading. A recently developed methodology was used, relying on the comparison of removal efficiency predictions (obtained with the Activated Sludge Model for Xenobiotics (ASM-X)) with representative measured data from literature. By applying this methodology, we demonstrated that (a) the elimination of sulfamethoxazole may be significantly underestimated when not considering <b>retransformation</b> from conjugated metabolites, {{depending on the type}} (urban or hospital) and size of upstream catchments; (b) operation at extended SRT may enhance antibiotic removal, as shown for sulfamethoxazole; (c) not accounting for fractions sorbed in influent and effluent solids may cause slight underestimation of ciprofloxacin removal efficiency.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the possibility of}} improving glucoamylase (GLA) production in Aspergillus niger strains carrying multiple copies of the GLA encoding gene (glaA), additional glaA copies were introduced either by genetic recombination or <b>retransformation.</b> For strains {{to be used in}} such experiments a genetic analysis was first carried out. The results of this analysis clearly revealed that in each transformant integration had occurred at a chromosome corresponding to a single linkage group (LG). The GLA production per gene copy showed considerable variation in these strains, indicating a clear effect of the site of integration on gene expression. Introduction of additional gene copies by genetic recombination experiments was carried out for different combinations of strains, carrying glaA copies in different chromosomes. The introduction of additional glaA gene copies by genetic recombination did not result in a considerable increase in GLA production compared to the parental strains. In some strains recombination resulted in genetic instability, observed by the frequent loss of glaA copies. Also, <b>retransformation</b> of multi-copy glaA strains did not result in an increase in GLA production. In several strains even a decrease in GLA production was found after <b>retransformation.</b> Southern analysis of these transformants suggested that newly introduced gene copies were heavily rearranged, which partly explains why GLA production was not increased.

In this article, the author describes and compares four methods handling unobserved heterogeneity in survival analysis: the Andersen-Gill approach, the robust sandwich variance estimator, the hazard model with individual frailty, and the <b>retransformation</b> method. An empirical analysis provides strong evidence that {{in the presence of}} strong unobserved heterogeneity, the application of a standard survival model can yield equally robust parameter estimates and the likelihood ratio statistic as does a corresponding model adding an additional parameter for random effects.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the magnitude of}} prediction bias when employing a traditional two-part model of adult cigarette demand. In particular, this paper is the first econometric study to investigate the bias associated with naively assuming that error <b>retransformation</b> is homoscedastic in price. The traditional two part model that is estimated in this paper models the propensity to smoke {{and the intensity of}} smoking separately. A modified two-part model that allows the error <b>retransformation</b> to be heteroscedastic in price is estimated. The results from this research imply that the price of cigarettes is a very important determinant of adult cigarette demand. The estimates imply that policies to increase the price of cigarettes will reduce not only prevalence of smoking, but will also decrease the number of cigarettes smoked by smokers. However, the price coefficients obtained from the conditional demand equations are biased away from zero when using the traditional log-transformed dependent variable. The price elasticities are biased. A generalized linear model yielded conditional price elasticities less than one-half of those obtained using the traditional method. ...|$|E

Many properties of univariate median filters generalise to such a filter.

One clone, D 62, contained two complete Ab-MuLV proviruses and expressed polyprotein P 120. The other clone, K 49, contained four proviruses: {{three of them were}} complete and one represented a deletion mutant. In addition to P 120, a new polyprotein, P 60, was expressed in this clone. During the processes of reversion and <b>retransformation</b> proviral DNAs were conserved with respect to size and integration site. In contrast to the transformants, expression of Ab-MuLV P 120, and in case of clone K 49 also of P 60, was blocked in revertant lines as a result of loss of transcription of proviral DNA. In retransformants, expression of Ab-MuLV P 120 was found in both clones. However, no expression of P 60 was detectable in retransformants of K 49 -derived revertants. Reversion to the nontransformed phenotype was associated with increased cytosine methylation in proviral DNA sequences, whereas in spontaneous retransformants methylation tended to resume control levels. These findings demonstrate regulation of viral oncogene mediated transformation by cytosine methylation and suggest that transcription of proviral DNA is under both viral and cellular control. They furthermore suggest that processes involved in regulation of proviral expression do not affect all such proviruses simultaneously in the same way. status: publishe...|$|E
