Animals can be ranked nationally for selection decisions, and success of vari-ous management practices and environ-ments in supporting profitable produc-tion and in minimizing disease incidence can be determined. Baseline information is useful for analyzing farm business sta-tus. Genetic evaluations depend on ac-curate <b>recording</b> <b>of</b> <b>parentage,</b> produc-tion, and environmental factors. Epidemiological data should be represen-tative of the entire population. Data col-lection can be accomplished through periodic contribution of producer records to a central site or by national record keeping through service agencies. In ad-dition to DHIA supervisors, who presently collect most dairy data, consul-tants and veterinarians also should con-tribute information. Surveys may be needed for some health and financial data. Collection of data from many sources can be made efficient by stan-dardizing formats for data exchange. Present processing power of personal computers and availability of electronic linkages enable on-farm record process-ing. Regional processing centers could emphasize accumulation of national summary data and development and sup-port of on-farm systems. With appropri-ate organization, the cost of contributing on-farm information to a national data-base should be small. Resulting manage...|$|E

40|$|This article {{critically}} examines current practices, {{processes and}} laws regarding parentage details on birth certificates in Australia. The discussion reveals {{tensions between the}} use of birth certificates as a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> legal <b>parentage</b> and their use as a <b>record</b> <b>of</b> biological heritage. These tensions are exacerbated by the increasing numbers of children whose legal parents are not also their biological parents because they were conceived through assisted reproductive technologies. It is concluded that the current procedures regarding parentage details on birth certificates do not adequately support the child's right to have their legal parents named on their birth certificate. There is inadequate explanation of who is entitled to be named as a parent on the birth register. Australian policy regarding artificial conception procedures and international law emphasise a child's right to information about biological heritage. Current laws do not support the use of birth certificates as a means of providing an accurate <b>record</b> <b>of</b> biological heritage. Nor do current laws or practices support emerging family forms, where more than two people are involved in a child's conception and birth and wish to have their involvement reflected on the birth register. Reform in law and procedure is desirable, at the very least through improved explanation to new parents about who is a legal parent and who should be named as a parent on the child's birth certificate...|$|R

Accurate and complete pedigree information is a prerequisite for accurate selection and estimation of breeding values that in turn can improve the traits associated with fleece quality and yield. South African Angora goats are farmed under extensive breeding conditions in relatively large herds. As a result breeders make use of mating systems that tend to limit accurate <b>parentage</b> <b>recording.</b> Incorporation <b>of</b> genetic <b>parentage</b> testing into the breeding plan can improve the accuracy <b>of</b> pedigree <b>records</b> and lead to increased selection accuracy. Microsatellite markers were evaluated for inclusion into a parentage verification panel, to be applied in the South African Angora goat population. The panel of 18 microsatellite markers was constructed, optimized and tested in 200 South African Angora goats. These goats represented different family structures, including candidate parents alone as well as known and candidate parents. The microsatellite markers were evaluated {{based on the number of}} alleles, allele frequency, PIC, HE, HO and CPE of each individual marker and as a panel. Four microsatellite markers were excluded from the panel based on their poor performance for the above mentioned parameters. The panel of 14 markers allowed a cost effective panel with the highest exclusion power. The CPE 1 of the 14 microsatellite marker panel was 99. 73 %.

50|$|The name Killaly is {{rare and}} {{associated}} with the county of Offaly, but no <b>record</b> <b>of</b> his <b>parentage</b> or birthplace has been discovered {{and it is possible}} that he was born and educated in England. In around 1791 Killaly started carrying out some surveys for the Grand Canal. By 1794 he had made such an impression on the directors that he was asked to join the company at a salary of £150 per annum. By 1796 they reported that from being 'a mere measurer and surveyor' he had become 'the complete superintendent of all kinds of work'. He took on the most difficult stretch of the canal, across the Bog of Allen close to Edenderry, which at John Smeaton's suggestion had been built high {{across the surface of the}} bog. William Jessop had attempted to stem the water leakage by using 'ribs of clay' and eventually one of the directors of the company, Richard Griffith, challenged this approach and Killaly adopted a much more gentle profile that stabilized the canal, though it was to remain a problem. For the extension from Tullamore to Shannon Harbour another bog had to be crossed near the river Brosna, and this time Killaly carried out extensive drainage works over several years along the line of the canal and allowed the land to subside before excavating the canal.|$|R
40|$|Determination <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> is {{fundamental}} {{to the study of}} biology and to applications such as the identification of pedigrees. Limitations to studies <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> have stemmed from the use of an insufficient number of hypervariable loci and mismatches of alleles that can be caused by mutation or by laboratory error and that can generate false exclusions. Furthermore, most studies <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> have been limited to comparisons of small numbers of specific parent-progeny triplets thereby precluding large-scale surveys of candidates where there may be no prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>parentage.</b> We present an algorithm that can determine probability <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> in circumstances where there is no prior knowledge of pedigree and that is robust in the face of missing data or mistyped data.

40|$|Inferring the <b>parentage</b> <b>of</b> {{a sample}} of {{individuals}} is often a prerequisite for many types of analysis in molecular ecology, evolutionary biology and quantitative genetics.

Here we present a Bayesian approach that simultaneously estimates the <b>parentage</b> <b>of</b> {{a sample of}} individuals and a wide range of population-level parameters in which we are interested. We show that joint estimation <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> and population-level parameters increases the power <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> assignment, reduces bias in parameter estimation, and accurately evaluates uncertainty in both. We illustrate the method by analysing a number of simulated test data sets, and through a re-analysis <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> in the Seychelles warbler, Acrocephalus sechellensis. A combination of behavioural, spatial and genetic data are used in the analyses and, importantly, the method does not require strong prior information about the relationship between nongenetic data and parentage...|$|R

40|$|Determining {{parentage}} is {{a fundamental}} problem in biology and in applications such as identifying pedigrees. Difficulties inferring parentage derive from extensive inbreeding within the population, whether natural or planned; using an insufficient number of hypervariable loci; and from allele mismatches caused by mutation or by laboratory errors that generate false exclusions. Many studies <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> have been limited to comparisons of small numbers of specific parent-progeny triplets. There have been few large-scale surveys of candidates {{in which there is}} no prior knowledge <b>of</b> <b>parentage.</b> We present an algorithm that determines the probability <b>of</b> <b>parentage</b> in circumstances where there is no prior knowledge of pedigree and that is robust in the face of missing data and mistyped data. The focus is <b>parentage</b> <b>of</b> an inbred line having uncertain ancestry. The algorithm is a variation of a previously published hybrid-focused algorithm. We describe the algorithm and demonstrate its performance in determining <b>parentage</b> <b>of</b> 43 inbred varieties of soybean that have been profiled using 236 SSR loci and from seven inbred varieties of maize that were profiled using 70 SSR loci.
