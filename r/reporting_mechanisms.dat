2500|$|Pervasive.SQL 7 was {{released}} in March, 1998, and included Scalable SQL 4 and Btrieve 7.0. Btrieve 7.0 ran on the same platforms as Btrieve 6.x: Windows 95, Windows NT 3.51 & 4, Netware and DOS. However, the company changed to a component-based architecture called SmartComponents to resolve compatibility issues with upgrades. This used a component identification scheme both embedded into the file and encoded into the file name, along with dynamic binding of [...] "glue files" [...] (DLLs loaded into memory only when needed). The dynamic binding of components was done using a new [...] "Abstract OS Services DLL" [...] that looked for {{the latest version of}} the appropriate needed component via the file name encoding. This [...] "glue module" [...] is then loaded into memory and used. The old log file format of Btrieve 6.x was also replaced with a new centralised log called PVSW.LOG and that had a unified and enhanced log file format. They also improved their error messages and error message <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms.</b>|$|E

5000|$|HRESULTS were {{originally}} {{defined in the}} IBM/Microsoft OS/2 operating system as a general purpose error return code, and subsequently adopted in Windows NT. Microsoft Visual Basic substantially enhanced the HRESULT error <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> by associating an [...] object with an HRESULT error code, by storing a pointer to an IErrorInfo COM object in thread-local storage. The IErrorInfo mechanism allows programs to associate a broad variety of information with a particular HRESULT error: the class of the object that raised the error, the interface of the object that raised the error, error text; and a link to a help topic in a help file. In addition, receivers of an HRESULT error can obtain localized text for the error message on demand.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a cluster-based {{selective}} CSS scheme which utilizes an efficient selective method {{for the best}} quality sensing data and a parallel <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The selective method, which is usually adopted in cooperative communications [14, 15], is applied in each cluster to implicitly select the best sensing node during each sensing interval as the cluster header without additional collaboration among CUs. The parallel <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanism</b> based on frequency division is considered to strongly reduce the reporting time of the cluster decision. In the FC, the optimal Chair-Vashney rule (CV rule) is utilized to obtain a high sensing performance based on the available cluster’s signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In this way, the proposed cooperative sensing will be performed with an extremely low cooperation resource while a certain high level of sensing performance is ensured.|$|R

It is recognised that the organisation has valid requirements in terms of reporting and stakeholder involvement. However dedicated <b>reporting</b> <b>mechanisms</b> established by the project can address the former and the project governance framework must itself address the latter. What should be avoided is the situation where {{the decisions of the}} steering committee or project board are required to be ratified by one or more persons in the organisation outside of that project decision making forum; either include these individuals as members of the project decision making body or fully empower the current steering committee/project board. The steering committee/project board is responsible for approving, reviewing progress, and delivering the project outcomes, and its intended benefits, therefore, they must have capacity to make decisions, which may commit resources and funding outside the original plan. This is the final principle of effective project governance.|$|E
