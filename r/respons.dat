Nuclear factor kappa-B (NFkB) is a transcription factor related to the mechanism of apoptosis resistance of a cell, which can affect the post-radiation response. The aim {{of this study is to}} assess the relative expression of NFkB in locally advanced cervical cancer and its relation to radiotherapy response. The study was conducted with observational cohort design on January-October 2015. Pre-radiotherapy cervical biopsy specimen was collected from 17 subjects, while only 10 subjects were willing to be taken mid-radiotherapy cervical biopsy specimen. We extracted and analyzed mRNA of NFkB by using qRT-PCR. NFkB relative expression was tested to its correlation with radiotherapy response. This study demonstrated that median of pra-radiotherapy relative expression on subjects with negative response (0. 667; SD 0. 413) was higher than positive response (0. 315; SD 160. 298), but not statistically significant (p= 0. 578). Alteration of mid-radiotherapy NFkB relative expression compared to pra-radiotherapy showed correlation to radiotherapy response. It is concluded that reduced expression of mid-radiotherapy NFkB relative expression plays a role in increasing radiotherapy response.

Online Stimulus advertisement is formatted through a kind of audio-visual media format, picture animation, and picture text. The main purpose of this research is focused on the format shape of online medium, however, as a compare, brochures are usually used as one of offline mediums. The format of research use factorial experimental design with the online and offline medium as the factor. Besides, to evaluate indirect impacts of emotional response to the impulsive buying behavior tendency, it has used resources expenditure, recreation and convenience shopping oriented which are intervening variables. The results of this research shows that there are different of stimulus impacts between offline and online medium formats. It has been found that the format of online medium has stronger stimulus effect than the offline one. Although, online format medium has stronger stimulus total effect, but still the format of audio visual medium and text of picture has stronger effect than the form of picture animation. The other finding, The resources expenditures has a positive intervening between emotional responses towards recreation shopping oriented but has negative intervening towards convenience shopping oriented. This can be clearly seen on the format of audio visual and picture animation medium. The result of the same analysis has proven that convenience shopping oriented is a positive intervening between emotional response and impulsive buying behavior tendency but recreation shopping oriented has negative impact.
