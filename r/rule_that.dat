With the court effectively evenly divided on all issues, there was no majority decision, and so Rhodes would have to wait for an appellate verdict before he could abolish the Legislative Council.|$|R

5|$|An error as to a jurisdictional, or precedent, fact is an {{exception}} to the general <b>rule</b> <b>that</b> the High Court does not judicially review errors of fact. Under the threefold classification of the broad grounds of judicial review set out in Council of Civil Service Unions v.

5|$|Another {{exception}} to the general <b>rule</b> <b>that</b> courts will generally only judicially review errors of law is where action is taken or a decision is {{made on the basis}} of no evidence, a lack of sufficient evidence, or an error of material fact.

5|$|In some circumstances, {{the conduct}} of the {{defendant}} can be a factor in determining the unreasonableness of their interference. In this situation the motives of the defendant and the reasonableness of their conduct are the factors used to determine the unreasonableness of their actions. This {{is one of the few}} exceptions to the <b>rule</b> <b>that</b> malice is not relevant in tort law. In Christie v Davey, the defendant was deliberately creating a noise to frustrate the claimants; based on this, it was held that their actions were malicious, unreasonable, and amounted to a nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Many {{contemporary}} Orthodox scholars <b>rule</b> <b>that</b> {{the area}} {{in front of the}} Wall has the status of a synagogue and must be treated with due respect. This is the view upheld by the authority in charge of the wall. As such, men and married women are expected to cover their heads upon approaching the Wall, and to dress appropriately. When departing, the custom is to walk backwards away from the Wall. On Saturdays, it is forbidden to enter the area with electronic devices, including cameras, which infringe on the sanctity of the Sabbath.|$|E

The Chamber rejected the request by the Prosecutor to include the charge of torture in count 3.

40|$|I study 46 vintages of FRB/US, the {{principal}} macro model used by Federal Reserve, as measures of real-time model uncertainty {{and examine the}} robustness of commonly applied, simple monetary policy rules.
