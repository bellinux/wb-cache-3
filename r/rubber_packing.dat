40|$|The paper {{describes}} a unique dynamic characterization modeling process of Lord Corporation’s isolation system for an executive jet aircraft. It was performed {{as part of}} a Joint Plan of three companies to build a global acoustic model of the aircraft, engines and engine isolators, which would allow for prediction of the cabin noise. The objective of the isolator modeling process was to calculate the dynamic stiffness matrices of the three isolators, which are made of metal and rubber materials, as functions of frequency for the working point conditions. The Modal analyses of the metal components and <b>rubber</b> <b>packs</b> showed that their dynamics would not affect the dynamic behaviors of the isolators in the frequency range of interest. Isolator Model C, which is a hybrid model, had an analytical part and an experimental part. The analytical part was based on nonlinear hyperelastic FE models of the <b>rubber</b> <b>packs.</b> The outputs of these models were six stiffnesses per <b>rubber</b> <b>pack</b> for the working point static loads. These stiffnesses served as input to model B, which is a spring FE model that allowed for the calculation of the full 6 X 6 isolator static stiffness matrices. The experimental part of Model C was based on dynamic shear tests of rubber samples, which addressed the effects of the working point temperature, static and dynamic strains, as well as, frequency on the rubber properties. The test results were used to scale the six stiffnesses per <b>rubber</b> <b>pack,</b> which were obtained from the hyperelastic models. The scaled stiffnesses served as input to Model B, which was used as an engine to generate the dynamic stiffness matrices of the isolators as functions of frequency for the working point conditions...|$|R

40|$|A {{prediction}} method {{of the degree}} of cure is presented for the curing process of styrene-butadien <b>rubber</b> <b>packed</b> in a cylindrical mold with relatively large size. Heat conduction equation for one-dimensional, transient heat transfer is coupled to the cure kinetics of the rubber.

Two experimental methods for the mold temperature control are examined. One is that the heating is continued at a constant temperature until the uniform temperature profile across the rubber is observed. The other is that the heating was cut off before the uniform temperature profile was formed in order to study the effects of residual heat on the cure process. The two experimental cure data sets can be correlated by the present {{prediction method}} to a mean absolute deviation of 11. 5 %...|$|R

It obtains a reasonable and relatively satisfactory solution between the nesting time and nesting solution. This article adopts a physical method that uses <b>rubber</b> band <b>packing</b> algorithm to simulate a rubber band wrapping those packing irregular items. The simulation shows a visual and fast packing process. The resultant rubber band force is applied in the packing items to translate, rotate, and slide them to make the area decrease and obtain a high packing density. An improved analogy QuickHull algorithm is presented to obtain extreme points of rubber band convex hull. An adaptive module could set a variable rubber band force and a variable time step to make a proper convergence and no intersection.

40|$|Study of a {{curing process}} of rubber has been conducted. Two kinds of rubbers, {{vulcanized}} and compounded SBR rubbers, were tested. The <b>rubber</b> was <b>packed</b> in a cylindrical container of inner diameter 74. 6 mm.

For the two cases, typical temperature fields for unsteady, one-dimensional heat conduction problems were observed. However, the uniform temperature field was formed faster for the compounded rubber than for the vulcanized one.

Thus, the cause of these failures was investigated through the comparative analysis for both the failed and the unfailed with two different manufacturers using various analysis methods. The failure analysis was performed using analysis methods such as swelling or swelling ratio, total sulfur content, polymer identification, loading and surface area of carbon black, and hardness. Consequently, the main cause of this failure was identified to be insufficient loading of carbon black as a reinforcing agent, together with small surface area of carbon black and somewhat low sulfur content...|$|R

40|$|Microgels are {{deformable}} colloids {{that can}} be packed by external compression; such packing transforms a suspension of loose microgels into a viscoelastic paste with mechanical properties controlled by the elasticity of the constituent particles. We aim {{to understand how the}} presence of microgel particles with different individual elastic moduli affects this interplay in heterogeneous microgel packings. We do this by preparing microgel pastes that contain both soft, loosely cross linked and stiff, densely cross linked microgel particles and probe their shear elasticity. We consider particle packing fractions that cover the range from particles at the onset of contact to particles that are strongly packed, deformed, and deswollen to investigate the transition from a particulate suspension to a macrogel type system. These studies reveal that the elasticity of heterogeneous microgel suspensions at low packing is due to the response of the soft, easily deformable microgel particles alone, whereas at high packing both soft and stiff microgels linearly add to the paste elasticity. This fundamental difference is due to the fundamentally different origin of elasticity at different microgel packing; whereas the soft particle interaction potential dominates the suspension mechanics at low microgel <b>packing,</b> <b>rubber</b> like elasticity that equally reflects both soft and stiff contributions governs the mechanics of the same samples at high microgel packing...|$|R
50|$|The bosanga {{method is}} {{described}} in the 1907 Journal of the African Society (as noted in a preface and postscript by the editor, a vastly more pleasant description than the outraged accounts of the Congo Reform Association a few years previous):Makala {{is one of the}} great rubber centres of the Congo, and during my long stay at that post, I had excellent opportunities of studying the method of rubber-collection.In different districts, this varies considerably. At Makala, each adult man has to bring in 5 kilos per month, and this he can collect in 40 working hours. Payment is at the rate of 30 centimes per kilo, of which about 10 per cent. is given to the chief and the balance to the actual gatherer.The natives usually go out in couples—build a little shanty in the midst of the jungle and work in a circle round it. Climbing the rubber-bearing tree or vine, they slash the bark with two or three V-shaped cuts, one below the other, and then arrange a broad leaf underneath, so as to form a trough. This is to conduct the sap, which oozes out, about the consistency and colour of ideal milk, into a gourd, or preferably, a galley-pot, procured at the station. The rubber from trees and vines is mixed promiscuously, the natives preferring to tap the latter, as they say it flows more freely. In any case, they put some vine rubber into that from the trees, as it coagulates more rapidly.Returned to their hut, the gatherers pour the sap into an earthenware pot containing water, place it on the fire and stir it with a stick which they call bosanga. In about ten minutes the rubber, owing to the acid in the bosanga, begins to collect round the stick, and soon a mass is formed. This is lifted out, placed on a big leaf and rinsed with clean cold water. Then, enveloped in leaves, it is kneaded for a minute or two with hands or feet, to press out the remaining moisture. It is now ready to be cut up into rough cubes, which are spread to dry on a little platform built over the fire. Here it remains for an hour or two, before it is packed in the loosely made baskets in which the native carries it to the station.As the rubber-laden caravan of men, women and children, headed by the chief and the forest-guard, wind their way from their village into the post, discordant notes are blown on a trumpet made from an antelope-horn, and all chant a chorus. Long before the party reaches the post, this barbaric music, ever increasing in volume, heralds their approach to the official in charge, and he makes his preparations to receive the rubber.He meets the laden caravan at the beam-scale of the station where the rough baskets are weighed and the price paid in cloth, salt, bells, soap, beads and suchlike coveted treasures. The payment over, off they all rush, like children out of school, yelling and shouting at the top of their voices.The rubber is then spread on platforms under large sheds, until the women workers of the post have cut it into neat little cubes. This done, for three months it lies in layers on the platforms to dry and is turned once a fortnight, till all the moisture has evaporated. During this process it loses some 25 per cent. in weight.Meanwhile very neatly plaited baskets are being prepared from rattan cane, into which the dry <b>rubber</b> is <b>packed,</b> till every basket weighs exactly 5 lbs. A tin label is attached to each, with the distinctive number and place of origin, and they are then laid out in long rows, ready for transport by porters, canoe, rail and steamer to Europe.|$|R
