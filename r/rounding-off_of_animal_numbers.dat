40|$|AbstractDuring {{four months}} in the winter period of 2002 – 2003, a census of four species <b>of</b> hoofed <b>animals</b> (red deer, sika deer, roe deer, and musk deer) was {{conducted}} in the study areas of the Sikhote-Alin Reserve and the surrounding area, including {{the territory of the}} planned Reserve Tavayza. The census was conducted on a monthly basis at two sites in the pine and broadleaved forest (nature Reserve and surrounding area) and at three sites in the oak and broadleaved forest. A total of 40 counts were made. Five fieldworkers were working at each site for two days. During the first day, the fieldworkers counted daily hoof prints and removed them. During the second day, newly appearing hoof prints were counted. In addition to the usual counting of crossings <b>of</b> hoofed <b>animals,</b> the <b>number</b> <b>of</b> individual <b>animals</b> was counted, as well. Thus, the census was conducted by two methods: counting of hoof prints in the tracks and counting <b>of</b> individual <b>animals</b> in a certain area. The results of these surveys were organized into a database which shows the relative density <b>of</b> hoofed <b>animals</b> (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> crossings of hoof prints per 10 km of the route) and absolute density <b>of</b> hoofed <b>animals</b> (<b>number</b> <b>of</b> individuals per km 2).

30|$|The {{cross-country}} {{comparison of}} daily grazing itineraries revealed larger distances covered by cattle in Mongolia than in China, likely caused by lower herbage offers in Mongolia {{on the one}} hand and the Chinese regulation <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> per pasture on the other hand. However, differences in daily distances and thus in sizes of theoretical utilized pasture areas between species may be explained by their different foraging preferences and accessibility of pastures. As various authors have reasoned, in particular, topographic features such as steep slopes and high stone cover at the pastures may limit the grazing radius of cattle (Zemmrich et al. 2010; Fujita et al. 2013; Turner et al. 2014) as was also observed in the Altay-Dzungarian region. The relatively short distances covered by of Chinese cattle during the winter are a result of restricted pasture grounds (pastures near the village and partly fenced pastures) and additional fodder supply in the form of hay.|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{turnover}} of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction is regulated in an activity-dependent manner. Upon denervation and under various other pathological conditions, receptor half-life is decreased. Methodology/Principal Findings: We demonstrate {{a novel approach}} to follow the kinetics of acetylcholine receptor lifetimes upon pulse labeling of mouse muscles with 125 I-a-bungarotoxin in vivo. In contrast to previous assays where residual activity was measured ex vivo, in our setup the same animals are used throughout the whole measurement period, thereby permitting a dramatic reduction <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> at increased data quality. We identified three stability levels of acetylcholine receptors depending on {{the presence or absence}} of innervation: one pool of receptors with a long half-life of, 13 days, a second with an intermediate half-life of, 8 days, and a third with a short half-life of, 1 day. Data were highly reproducible from animal to animal and followed simple exponential terms. The principal outcomes of these measurements were reproduced by an optical pulse-labeling assay introduced recently. Conclusions/Significance: A novel assay to determine kinetics of acetylcholine receptor turnover with small <b>animal</b> <b>numbers</b> is presented. Our data show that nerve activity acts on muscle acetylcholine receptor stability by at least two different means, one shifting receptor lifetime from short to intermediate and another, which further increases recepto...|$|R
40|$|Our {{research}} {{presents a}} proof-of-concept that explores {{a new and}} innovative method to identify large animals in aerial imagery with single day image differencing. We acquired two aerial images of eight fenced pastures and conducted a principal component analysis of each image. We then subtracted the first principal component of the two pasture images followed by heuristic thresholding to generate polygons. The number of polygons represented the number of potential cattle (Bos taurus) and horses (Equus caballus) in the pasture. The process was considered semi-automated because {{we were not able}} to automate the identification of spatial or spectral thresholding values. Imagery was acquired concurrently with ground counts <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> <b>numbers.</b> Across the eight pastures, 82 % <b>of</b> the <b>animals</b> were correctly identified, mean percent commission was 53 %, and mean percent omission was 18 %. The high commission error was due to small mis-alignments generated from image-to-image registration, misidentified shadows, and grouping behavior <b>of</b> <b>animals.</b> The high probability <b>of</b> correctly identifying <b>animals</b> suggests short time interval image differencing could provide a new technique to enumerate wild ungulates occupying grassland ecosystems, especially in isolated or difficult to access areas.
