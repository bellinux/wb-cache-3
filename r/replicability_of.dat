40|$|Abstract-The {{investigation}} of anomalous experience may be conducted {{within the realm}} of folklore, collective behavior, and the sociology of reli-gion. Although these social scientific approaches lack the mathematical precision of the physical sciences, they allow theoretical development, the testing of hypotheses derived from these orientations, and the revision of theory in light of empirical observation. The use of social scientific para-digms grants the {{investigation of}} anomalous phenomena a cumulative qual-ity, open to both skeptics and believers. Alleged anomalous events can be investigated within the study of folklore, collective behavior, and religion. The use of these paradigms would reduce problems associated with skeptical attacks, low rates <b>of</b> <b>replicability,</b> lack <b>of</b> accepted theoretical orientations, and experimenter effects.

50|$|A further {{criticism}} of the p-rep statistic involves the logic of experimentation.

40|$|Metabolically Coupled Replicator Systems (MCRS) are {{a family}} of models {{implementing}} a simple, physico-chemically and ecologically feasible scenario for the first steps of chemical evolution towards life. Evolution in an abiotically produced RNA-population sets in as soon as {{any one of the}} RNA molecules become autocatalytic by engaging in template directed self-replication from activated monomers, and starts increasing exponentially. Competition for the finite external supply of monomers ignites selection favouring RNA molecules with catalytic activity helping self-replication by any possible means. One way of providing such autocatalytic help is to become a replicase ribozyme. An additional way is through increasing monomer supply by contributing to monomer synthesis from external resources, i. e., by evolving metabolic enzyme activity. Retroevolution may build up an increasingly autotrophic, cooperating community of metabolic ribozymes running an increasingly complicated and ever more efficient metabolism. Maintaining such a cooperating community of metabolic replicators raises two serious ecological problems: one is keeping the system coexistent in spite <b>of</b> the different <b>replicabilities</b> <b>of</b> the cooperating replicators; the other is constraining parasitism, i. e., keeping "cheaters" in check. Surface-bound MCRS provide an automatic solution to both problems: coexistence and parasite resistance are the consequences of assuming the local nature of metabolic interactions. In this review we present an overview of results published in previous articles, showing that these effects are, indeed, robust in different MCRS implementations, by considering different environmental setups and realistic chemical details in a few different models. We argue that the MCRS model framework naturally offers a suitable starting point for the future modelling of membrane evolution and extending the theory to cover the emergence of the first protocell in a self-consistent manner. The coevolution of metabolic, genetic and membrane functions is hypothesized to follow the progressive sequestration scenario, the conceptual blueprint for the earliest steps of protocell evolution.

Another problem with NHST is that it can provide highly misleading evidence against the null hypothesis (Killeen, 2005 a, p. 345) : NHST can lead one to reject the null hypothesis when there is really not enough evidence to do so.
