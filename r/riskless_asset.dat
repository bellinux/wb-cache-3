40|$|With {{regard to}} {{retirement}} savings individual investors tend to hold large positions of their wealth in <b>riskless</b> <b>assets,</b> although equity products offer higher returns. In {{this article we}} study a behavioral portfolio model which captures this phenomenon by considering two behavioral aspects: fear and hope. In detail, we extend Shefrin's and Statman's stochastic behavioral portfolio model [SS 00] and provide an equivalent deterministic model, which can be solved numerically. This allows us to apply this behavioral portfolio model even to {{a large amount of}} return data of retirement assets. When we assume fear, we find an optimal retirement portfolio with large positions in <b>riskless</b> <b>assets.</b> In this case, the proportion invested in equity is very small up to zero, while it is large when we assume hope. In short, a fear-driven behavior results in a smaller expected portfolio return and a shifting of wealth from risky to riskless assets; a hope-driven behavior results in a larger expected portfolio return and a shifting of wealth from <b>riskless</b> to risky <b>assets...</b>|$|R

40|$|The global {{imbalance}} {{explanation of}} the financial crisis of 2007 – 09 suggests that demand for <b>riskless</b> <b>assets</b> from countries with current account surpluses created fragility in countries with current account deficits, most notably in the United States. This paper examines this explanation by analyzing the geography of asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduits set up by large commercial banks. The paper shows that banks in surplus countries as well as banks in deficit countries manufactured <b>riskless</b> <b>assets,</b> totaling over $ 1. 2 trillion, by selling short-term ABCP to risk-averse investors, predominantly U. S. money market funds, and investing the proceeds primarily in long-term U. S. assets. As negative information about U. S. assets became apparent in August 2007, banks in both surplus and deficit countries experienced difficulties in rolling over ABCP and as a result suffered significant losses.

40|$|The U. S. is {{currently}} engulfed {{in the most}} severe financial crisis since the Great Depression. A key structural factor behind this crisis is the large demand for <b>riskless</b> <b>assets</b> {{from the rest of}} the world. In this paper we present a model to show how such demand not only triggered a sharp rise in U. S. asset prices, but also exposed the U. S. financial sector to a downturn by concentrating risk onto its balance sheet. In addition to highlighting the role of capital flows in facilitating the securitization boom, our analysis speaks to the broader issue of global imbalances. While in emerging markets the concern with capital flows is in their speculative nature, in the U. S. the risk in capital inflows derives from the opposite concern: capital flows into the U. S. are mostly non-speculative and in search of safety. As a result, the U. S. sells <b>riskless</b> <b>assets</b> to foreigners, and in so doing, it raises the effective leverage of its financial institutions. In other words, as global imbalances rise, the U. S. increasingly specializes in holding its "toxic waste. "...|$|R
