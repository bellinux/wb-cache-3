For since electrical masses of one sign repel each other, the negative electrical masses constituting the electron would necessarily be scattered under the influence of their mutual repulsions, unless there are forces of another kind operating between them, the nature of which has hitherto remained obscure to us.* [...] If we now assume that the relative distances between the electrical masses constituting the electron remain unchanged during the motion of the electron (<b>rigid</b> <b>connection</b> in the sense of classical mechanics), we arrive at a law of motion of the electron which does not agree with experience.

The first is a separate condenser, which increases {{the efficiency of the}} engine by allowing the main cylinder to remain hot at all times. The second is the parallel motion, which converts the up-and-down motion of the piston into the arcing motion of the beam, whilst maintaining a <b>rigid</b> <b>connection.</b> The <b>rigid</b> <b>connection</b> allowed the engine to be double-acting, meaning the piston could push as well as pull the beam.

Decision Support Systems (DSS) that combine engineer inter-action with computer-based tools to provide a joint-cognitive decision-making environment can significantly help engineers. In this study, three different computational approaches that can become part of such a DSS are proposed. Two of these approaches use simulation-based design to assist engineers with the design of (1) bridge trusses and (2) moment-resisting steel frames, {{and the third is}} intended for internet-enabled remote control and observation of experimental facilities. A hybrid optimization approach that is composed of two algorithms- an algorithm that generates a good starting solution and a local search, is proposed for truss optimization. The performance of the approach is compared with existing optimization approaches. Then, a GA-based optimization approach is presented for the design of moment-resisting steel frames with <b>rigid</b> <b>connections.</b> The GA uses a unique crossover scheme to perform trade-off study between the number of <b>rigid</b> <b>connections</b> and the total cost.

The high ratio between effective compression and shear rigidities derives both from the nonzero bending rigidity of nodes and rods, and from the confinement effect played by the stiffening plates. The obtained results emphasize the ability of such structures to behave as tension-capable and performance-based systems, whose mechanical properties are driven more by the geometry of the lattice microstructure (i. e., such systems behave as mechanical metamaterials) than the chemical composition of the material they are made of...|$|R

5000|$|The earlier single-action beam engines used a {{chain to}} connect the piston to the beam and this worked satisfactorily for pumping water from mines, etc. However, for rotary motion a linkage that works both in {{compression}} and tension provides a better design and allows a double-acting cylinder to be used. Such an engine incorporates a piston acted upon by steam alternately on the two sides, hence doubling its power. The linkage actually used by Watt (also invented by him) in his later rotary beam engines was called the parallel motion linkage, a development of [...] "Watt's linkage", but using the same principle. The piston of the engine {{is attached to the}} central point of the linkage, allowing it to act on the two outer beams of the linkage both by pushing and by pulling. The nearly linear motion of the linkage allows this type of engine to use a <b>rigid</b> <b>connection</b> to the piston without causing the piston to bind in its containing cylinder. This configuration also results in a smoother motion of the beam than the single-action engine, making it easier to convert its back-and-forth motion into rotation.|$|E
5000|$|The shaft effect, {{also known}} as {{elevator}} effect or shaft jacking, is a phenomenon occurring in shaft-drive motorcycles. This effect occurs because the acceleration being applied to the rear wheel creates a reactive force on the drive shaft. This in turn lifts the rider and {{the body of the}} bike, exacerbating the natural [...] "tucking under" [...] of the rear wheel. Under acceleration Newton's third law says trying to turn the wheel forward exerts a reactionary force against the drive mechanism. In the case of a belt, this makes the top part of the belt tighten and the whole bike [...] "shrug" [...] down just a bit. This is typically obscured because acceleration causes the rear wheel to [...] "tuck under." [...] A shaft-drive, on the other hand has a <b>rigid</b> <b>connection</b> to the hub so this reactionary force turns the shaft backwards about the rear wheel and the middle of the bike [...] "tightens" [...] and lifts the rider up. This effect {{is one of the most}} notable differences between riding a shaft-driven motorcycle and a typical motorcycle. The effect is most pronounced on older models of motorcycle as most modern shaft-driven bikes use one or two Paralevers to limit the rotation of the rear hub relative to the bike frame.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{behaviour}} of beam-column joint {{plays an}} important role in the response of a steel moment resisting framed structure especially under seismic excitation. Semi <b>rigid</b> <b>connections</b> like bolted joints, allow better energy dissipation and provide good response under lateral loads. In this paper the ductility and energy dissipation characteristics of semi <b>rigid</b> bolted <b>connections</b> using double web angle with top and seat angles is discussed based on experimental investigation. Non-linear analysis was also performed using finite element method to compare the results. The study revealed that ductile behaviour of beam-column connection is improved by increasing the number of bolts on the top and seat angles and the thickness of top and seat angles. The analytical results are in agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

5000|$|Slip joints {{in large}} {{structures}} {{are used to}} allow independent motion of large components while enabling them to be joined in some way. For example, if two tall buildings are to be joined with a pedestrian skyway at some high level, there are two options in structural engineering. If the buildings are identical in mass and elasticity they will tend to respond similarly to ground motion induced by earthquakes. In this case it may be appropriate to construct a <b>rigid</b> <b>connection</b> between the buildings, although this may require additional supporting members within the structures. On the other hand, a lower cost connection may be made by using a lightweight structure that is not coupled rigidly but instead which is allowed to slide or [...] "float" [...] relative to one or both structures. This is especially suitable where the two structures may respond differently to ground motion. The structure will not be completely free to move but rather may use elastic materials to locate it {{near the center of}} its range of motion and viscous shock absorbers to absorb energy and to restrict the speed of relative motion. When a sliding connection is used it is extremely important that there be sufficient range of motion without failure to accommodate the maximum credible relative motion of the structures.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to carry out a bibliographic review of all {{available}} literature addressing the issue of whether or not the connection of teeth to implants by means of a prosthesis is a viable treatment alternative. Twenty articles from a variety of sources were analyzed and classified in order to draw conclusions. Articles were classified by type and an analysis was made of the different variables considered in each study, obtaining percentages of implant survival ranging from 84. 4 % to 100 %, prosthetic complications ranging from 80 % to 90 %, and the incidence of dental intrusion ranging from 0 to 5. 6 %. Biomechanical studies: Some articles studied models in order to assess different connections subjected to force, in which varying results were obtained. Rigid connections appeared to produce the most stress to the natural tooth, periodontal ligament and peri-implant bone; non-rigid connections reduced the stress to the bone, but increased stress to the prosthesis. Clinical studies: The results obtained were disparate. Studies in the medium or short-term show this as a viable treatment alternative, whereas some studies point to a greater risk of complications, although the use of <b>rigid</b> <b>connection</b> decreases the percentage of intrusion. Other bibliographic reviews have concluded that there is a need for more longitudinal studies on the viability of tooth-implant connection, also concluding that complications are greater when this is the chosen treatment.
