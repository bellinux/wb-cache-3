25|$|Leros {{had been}} {{subjected}} by the Luftwaffe to a prolonged aerial bombardment, starting on 26 September, {{which had already}} caused significant casualties and damage to the defenders of the island and supporting naval forces. In {{the early hours of}} 12 November, the invasion force in two groups approached the island from east and west. Despite failures in some areas, the Germans established a bridgehead, while airborne forces landed on Mt. <b>Rachi,</b> {{in the middle of the}} island. After repulsing Allied counter-attacks and being reinforced the following night, the Germans quickly cut the island in two and the Allies surrendered on 16 November. The Germans suffered 520 casualties and captured 3,200 British and 5,350 Italian soldiers.|$|E
25|$|The {{positions}} of the British units were spread around the island with poor communication between them. The attacking German forces had the twin advantages of local numerical superiority and air control. In the early afternoon Luftwaffe fighter-bombers machine-gunned and bombed the area between the Gurna and Alinda Bays, followed by Junkers 52s which at 13:27 dropped some 600 parachutists from the Brandenburg Division over Mount <b>Rachi.</b> Some German aircraft were shot down by the batteries and {{about half of the}} paratroopers were killed, but the rest of them landed safely and attacked the nearby batteries, meeting stiff resistance and suffering heavy losses. One of them, no. 211, was captured before dark, and its commander, Lt. Antonino Lo Presti, was executed. The position of these landings effectively divided the island in two, separating the Buffs and a company of the King's Own {{on the south side of}} the island from the rest of the garrison. Counterattacks during the rest of that day failed.|$|E
