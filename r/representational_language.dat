We also observe that the technology that seems to underly peripheral sensory and motor activities (analogous to low-level animal or human vision and muscle control) seems to be quite different from the technology that seems to underly cognitive reasoning and problem solving.

40|$|The {{success of}} wikis for {{collaborative}} knowledge construction is triggering {{the development of}} a number of tools for collaborative conceptual modeling based on them. In this paper we present a completely revised version of MoKi, a tool for modelling ontologies and business process models in an integrated way. 1. CONCEPTUAL MODELING WITH MoKi MoKi 1 is a collaborative MediaWiki-based 2 tool for modeling ontological and procedural knowledge in an integrated manner. The main idea behind MoKi is to associate a wiki page, containing both unstructured and structured information, to each entity of the ontology and process model. In this section we present a completely revised version of MoKi, which extends the first release of the tool (see [2]). The main changes w. r. t. [2] are (i) the redesign of the content organisation of the MoKi page, which now comprises an unstructured part and a structured part (this extends and replaces the simple <b>representational</b> <b>languages</b> used in [2]); and (ii) the multi-mode access to the page content, to support easy usage both by domain experts and knowledge engineers, thus facilitating them to play an equally central role in the modelling activities (this extends and replaces the single template-based access mode provided in [2]). 1. 1 The MoKi page Being a tool supporting the description of ontological and procedural knowledge according to OWL and BPMN, the basic element for MoKi are concepts, properties, and individuals in the ontology, and processes in the process model.

40|$|The {{notion of}} data and {{information}} being different in kind {{is based on the}} Foundationalist thesis that there exist raw, brute, facts which constitute the data that form the basis for information, and, ultimately, of knowledge. Foun dationalism fails, however, because if these data are really different in kind from information and knowledge, then no comparisons are possible between the former and the latter, and the notion of data (in the sense of raw, brute, fact) becomes useless. If, on the other hand, comparisons can be made between data and information or knowledge, the data would have to be of the same kind as the latter. Given that an Information Processing System (IPS) cannot process data except in terms of whatever <b>representational</b> <b>language</b> is inherent to it, data could not even be apprehended by an IPS without becoming representational in nature, and thus losing their status of being raw, brute, facts. The <b>representational</b> <b>language</b> of the IPS provides the categories in terms of which the IPS 'views' reality, and thus this language will define what constitutes reality for the IPS in question. Consequently, this language will define what constitutes signals, signs, and information for the IPS, as well. Any definition of information must therefore be relative to a given IPS, and, {{in the case of a}} human IPS, what is regarded in common sense terms as linguistically encoded information cannot be independently characterized in purely physical terms...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to reveal the tacit {{assumptions}} of the logicist and structuralist theories on the nature of cardinal numbers. The privileged background theory is the <b>representational</b> theory of <b>language</b> with its main conjecture about necessary correspondence between metaphysical structure of reality and logical structure of language. In such a theory of language we meet a number of thesis on relations between syntax and semantics. Special attention is paid to the so called ‘syntactic priority thesis’: if an expression has the role of a singular term in a true sentence then there must be an object denoted by that term. On these assumptions logicisit develops the view that numerals refer to numbers and that numbers must be a kind of abstract objects. That position we call ‘Platonism of objects’. The inherent weakness of ‘Platonism of objects’ gave rise to the structuralist theory of cardinal numbers. Although the structuralist position in philosophy of mathematics is more congenial to the nature of mathematics as a deductive science, its proponents were reluctant to abandon assumptions on the relations between syntax and semantics as conceived in the <b>representational</b> theory of <b>language.</b> After examining some philosophical implications of measurement theory an...|$|R

If concepts are convex, it will in general be possible for interactors to agree on joint meaning even if they start out from different <b>representational</b> spaces. <b>Language</b> is discrete, while mental representations tend to be continuous—posing a seeming paradox. We show that the convexity assumption allows us to address this problem.
