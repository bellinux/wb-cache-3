5|$|Within days Kampfgruppe Hanke was {{withdrawn}} from the front line to rejoin the division and <b>re-fit,</b> and they were moved to Barcs on the Drava river for that purpose. On 2 December the division was reunited, except {{for the rest of}} the pioneer battalion, which remained stranded in Bosnia by damaged bridges and railways. As a result of continued desertions and the catastrophic casualties suffered by Kampfgruppe Hanke, the division retained little of its original Bosnian character. Despite the return of disarmed Bosnians from labour units, the attachment of Hungarian infantry and artillery units and arrival of German replacements meant the division looked little different from any other unit in the Second Panzer Army.|$|E
25|$|The Regia Marina had six battleships {{with which}} to contend {{for control of the}} Mediterranean, the four most modern of which were being <b>re-fit</b> at the {{outbreak}} of the war. In addition to the six capital ships, the Italians had 19 cruisers, 59 destroyers, 67 torpedo boats, and 116 submarines. Though the Regia Marina had a number of fast new cruisers with good range in their gunnery, the older classes were lightly built and had inadequate defensive armor. Numerically the Italian fleet was formidable, but there were a large number of older vessels, and the service suffered in general from insufficient time at sea for crew training.|$|E
25|$|Commencing in 2013, five GB Railfreight Class 73 were re-engined as Class 73/9 by Brush Traction Wabtec {{at their}} factory in Loughborough. The first three {{converted}} locomotives, renumbered 73961-3 from 73209, 73204 and 73206 respectively, were fitted with MTU 1,600hp V8 engines. All existing mechanical and electrical components were removed {{prior to the}} <b>re-fit,</b> and the frontal appearance of the locomotives has been altered by the provision of light clusters and the installation of a more central location for the jumper cables. The dual driving positions have been retained although with a new design for the driver's controls. The refurbished locomotives will be capable of working with existing Class 73/1 and 73/2 units in either diesel or electric mode.|$|E

Cardinal Beaton paid £6 for {{painting}} her in July 1541. In December 1542, Mary Willoughby, Salamander and Lion blockaded a London merchant ship called Antony of Bruges in a creek {{on the coast of}} Brittany. Willoughby fired on Anthony, and the crew abandoned ship. The French authority at [...] "Poldavy Haven" [...] accepted a Scottish warrant shown to them by her Captain, named Kerr.|$|E
2500|$|RMS Strathmore was {{an ocean}} liner and Royal Mail Ship of the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P), {{the third of}} five sister ships built for P in the [...] "Strath" [...] class. Launched in 1935, she served on the company's route from London to India until 1940, when she was requisitioned for war service as a troop ship, and redesignated as SS Strathmore, until being {{returned}} to her owners in 1948. After a long <b>re-fit,</b> she resumed service with P from 1949 until 1963, when she was sold to Latsis Lines and renamed Marianna Latsi, then Henrietta Latsi, before being laid up in 1967 and finally scrapped in 1969.|$|E

2500|$|On 5 October, U.S. II Corps renewed its {{offensive}} along a [...] front straddling Route 65 to Bologna. They {{were supported}} on their right flank by British XIII Corps including British 78th Infantry Division, newly returned to Italy after a three-month <b>re-fit</b> in Egypt. Gradual {{progress was made}} against stiffening opposition as German 14th Army moved troops from the quieter sector opposite U.S. IV Corps. By 9 October, they were attacking the massive 1,500 foot (450 m) high sheer escarpment behind Livergnano which appeared insuperable. However, the weather cleared {{on the morning of}} 10 October to allow artillery and air support to be brought to bear. Nevertheless, it took until the end of 15 October before the escarpment was secured. On the right of U.S. II Corps British XIII Corps was experiencing equally determined fighting on terrain just as difficult.|$|E
2500|$|The Broad Street {{studios in}} Birmingham – which were rented – came under Central's {{ownership}} in November 1991, by which time, its network and large scale programming capability had {{been transferred to}} Nottingham, scaling down the Birmingham operation to providing Central News West, regional programming and presentation operations, including those for CITV. In 1994, Central's new owners Carlton acquired land on nearby Gas Street to begin work on building a new, smaller digital studio complex. The new centre was completed in 1997, when Central West's regional news department moved from its Broad Street base, which was eventually demolished {{during the spring of}} 2015 {{to make way for the}} new 'Arena Central' development." [...] Having been one of the first fully computerised news programmes, Central News South was again a pioneer of new technology when, in the Spring of 2001, state-of-the-art Quantel digital video servers and edit suites were installed, along with a complete <b>re-fit</b> of camera and VTR equipment, placing Central South at the forefront of digital news-gathering in regional news.|$|E
2500|$|The SS Norway was {{registered}} in Oslo, given the call sign LITA (literally meaning [...] "small"), and was re-christened on 14 April 1980. She {{was the first}} (and only) purpose-built transatlantic ocean liner that was remodeled to be employed exclusively in luxury cruise service. Her hull form, bow design, and accommodation layout had been designed specifically for the rigors of crossing the North Atlantic, year-round. In her remodeling for cruise service, she was given a more generous accommodation, as well as larger and more numerous public spaces for the cruise-type recreations. Mechanically, the four screw propulsion plant was reduced to two screws. And in a bid for economy, she was given {{a complete set of}} bow/stern thrusters to give her the flexibility she needed to bring her into harbour; and, to dock, without resort to the expensive pilot and tugboat operations that were standard procedure in the heyday of the transatlantic express liners. When her <b>re-fit</b> was completed; and on her maiden call to Oslo, Senior Steward Wesley Samuels of Jamaica, in the presence of King Olav V, hoisted the United Nations flag {{as a sign of the}} ship's international crew.|$|E

2500|$|Fortune favours Roberts. His friend Woodbury, who {{as senator}} had been {{pressing}} for increased naval appropriations {{when he received}} Robert's letter {{on the need for}} trade negotiations, had just become Jackson's Secretary of the Navy and saw an opportunity. As the Potomac was departing the schooner Boxer was nearing commissioning; Peacock, outfitted for exploration but due to lack of funds diverted to duty in the West Indies, had returned for <b>re-fit.</b> Woodbury convinced Jackson to send both 10-gun ships to support Potomac [...] with Roberts as Jackson's [...] "special agent". Secretary of State Edward Livingston's [...] "Instructions to Special Agent Edmund Roberts" [...] signed 27 January 1832, order him to embark upon Peacock in the guise of the captain's clerk, his mission's purpose concealed except from the Captain and those with a need to know; while in passage he is to gather as much as possible of the knowledge previously requested of Shillaber; his duties as envoy will then begin at Cochin-China. Livingston adds a postscript that Roberts is to receive $6 per diem. [...] Jackson later explains to the Senate in his message of 30 May 1834, [...] "The expenses of the agency have been defrayed out of the contingent fund for foreign intercourse".|$|E
2500|$|In July 1941 the 8th Hussars, in Stuart tanks, {{were part}} of the 4th Armoured Brigade for Operation Crusader. During the three-day Battle of Sidi Rezegh Airfield, the {{regiment}} had formed a box leaguer for the night-time lull in fighting {{with the rest of the}} brigade on 22 November (as neither side had night vision aids, battle normally ceased at dusk). The leaguer was discovered by the 15th Panzer Division during the night and in the ensuing engagement left the Irish Hussars with just four Stuart Tanks fit for battle; 35 having been captured or destroyed. The regiment was issued 32 new Stuarts at Cairo and, under the command of Major Sandbach the regiment returned to the battle. On 1 December, to assist ANZAC forces the regiment charged [...] "cavalry style" [...] again at Sidi Rezegh and although the action was [...] successful, Major Sandbach was killed. Command then fell to Major Phillips. After a <b>re-fit</b> and influx of recruits at Beni Yusef the 8th Hussars were temporarily converted to armoured cars but before seeing action in them were issued with new tanks. [...] A & B Squadrons with the General Grant and C Squadron in Stuarts, all under the command of Lt Col Gerald [...] "Smash" [...] Kilkelly. Once again part of the 4th Armoured Brigade with which it served during the Gazala battles of May and June 1942, suffering heavy losses at the Battle of Knightsbridge in which Major Hackett was severely burnt and Colonel Kilkelly captured, and also battles at Bardia and Bir Hacheim. The 8th fought hard as a composite unit with the 4th City of London Yeomanry (casualties having reduced the size of both regiments) before having to withdraw with the rest of the British Eighth Army to El Alamein. In June, the remnants of the regiment under command of Lieutenant Colonel [...] "Cuthie" [...] Goulbourn detached one squadron to their future partners the 4th Queen's Own Hussars to form a temporary regiment called the 4th/8th Hussars. The brigade, including the 8th and the 4th/8th faced the massive enemy onslaught at Alam Halfa, defeating the enemy. They helped breach the minefields at the Second Battle of El Alamein and then joined the pursuit for three weeks. The regiment then enjoyed a short tour in Cyprus before returning to England.|$|E
