Earlier results on finding approximation algorithms for this problem are due to Gusfield (1991) who achieved an approximation ratio of 2 − 2 k, and Pevzner (1992) who improved it to 2 − 3 k. We generalize this approach to assemble an alignment of k sequences from optimally aligned subsets of l < k sequences to obtain an improved performance guarantee. For arbitrary l < k, we devise deterministic and randomized algorithms yielding performance guarantees of 2 − lk. For fixed l, the running times of these algorithms are polynomial in n and k...|$|R
