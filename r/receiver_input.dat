50|$|The driver {{rise time}} should be between 0.5 and 2ns. The {{differential}} voltage may range from 0.8 V to 1.4 V, with 1.0 V typical -- differential pseudo-ECL logic level signals.The differential impedance is 95 ± 10 ohms. The common mode output voltage is 2.5-4 V. The <b>receiver's</b> <b>input</b> impedance should be 100 ohms, within 10%. the <b>receiver</b> <b>input's</b> common mode voltage must be between -1 and 7 V.

50|$|AFC {{was mainly}} used in radios and {{television}} sets around the mid-20th century. In the 1970s, receivers {{began to be}} designed using frequency synthesizer circuits, which synthesized the <b>receiver's</b> <b>input</b> frequency from a crystal oscillator using the vibrations of an ultra-stable quartz crystal. These maintained sufficiently stable frequencies that AFC's were no longer needed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{rf signal}} from the distant {{transmitter}} must exist at the local <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> prior to, or at the time of, keying off the local transmitter.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunication, transmit-after-receive {{time delay}} {{is the time}} {{interval}} from removal of RF energy at the local <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> until the local transmitter is automatically keyed on and the transmitted rf signal amplitude has increased to 90% of its steady-state value. An Exception: High-frequency (HF) transceiver equipment is normally not designed with an interlock between receiver squelch and transmitter on-off key. The transmitter can be keyed on at any time, independent {{of whether or not}} a signal is being received at the <b>receiver</b> <b>input.</b>|$|E
50|$|Thus {{it can be}} {{see that}} {{receivers}} with a narrow bandwidth have a higher sensitivity than receivers with a large bandwidth and that input noise can be decreased by putting the <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> stage at a cold temperature.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the A and B connections, the EIA standard also specifies a third interconnection point called SC, which is the common signal reference ground. This connection {{may be used to}} limit the common-mode signal that can be impressed on the <b>receiver</b> <b>inputs.</b> This third signal is the reference potential used by the transceiver to measure the A and B voltages.|$|R
50|$|A radio {{receiver}} {{is connected to}} an antenna which converts some of the energy from the incoming radio wave into a tiny radio frequency AC voltage which {{is applied to the}} <b>receiver's</b> <b>input.</b> An antenna typically consists of an arrangement of metal conductors. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields of the radio wave push the electrons in the antenna back and forth, creating an oscillating voltage.|$|R
50|$|If the <b>receiver's</b> <b>input</b> is routed via {{a device}} which rejects the {{unwanted}} signals then this additional filtering {{can improve the}} immunity of the installation. It {{is the case that}} the additional filter will improve the situation. When a transmitter needs to be colocated with a receiver where the frequency difference is very small (for example 145.000 and 145.600 MHz) the cavity filters can be used on both the transmitter and the receiver to improve the purity of the transmitter and the immunity of the receiver.|$|R

5000|$|AM {{broadcast}} radios (and {{other consumer}} low frequency receivers) typically use small loop antennas;, a variable capacitor connected across the loop forms a tuned circuit that also tunes the <b>receivers</b> <b>input</b> stage as that capacitor tracks the main tuning. A multiband receiver may contain tap {{points along the}} loop winding in order to tune the loop antenna at widely different frequencies. In older AM radios, the antenna might consist of dozens of turns of wire mounted on {{the back wall of}} the radio (a frame antenna).|$|R
40|$|The Nkutunse antenna {{is a part}} of a {{receiving}} system, {{which generally}} consists of a receiver, a feed line also known as waveguide or transmission line and an antenna. All these system components have their contribution to the system noise. The system temperature (or the system noise level) is a critical factor in determining the sensitivity and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of a receiving system. The performance of a radio telescope system depends very much on the SNR at the <b>receiver’s</b> <b>input.</b> Signals must be at some amplitude above the noise floor of the system in order to be received properly. There is therefore the need to minimize the noise so that weak signals are not obscured. A mathematical model of the receiving system of the 32 -m diameter Kuntunse antenna was developed to determine the SNR at the <b>receivers</b> <b>input.</b> MATLAB Version 7. 12. 0. 635 (R 2011 a) was used to determine the results obtained. The total brightness noise temperature BT emitted on the antenna was modeled to be 589 K due to the contribution of emission of sky and ground noise temperatures when the antenna is being operated at 0 2 and 2 respectively. SNR was found to be greater than one generating a high signal power than the system noise power. Significantly, th...|$|R
50|$|Modern duplexers {{often use}} nearby {{frequency}} bands, so the frequency {{separation between the}} two ports is also much less. For example, the transition between the uplink and downlink bands in the GSM frequency bands may be about 1 percent (915 MHz to 925 MHz). Significant attenuation (isolation) is needed to prevent the transmitter's output from overloading the <b>receiver's</b> <b>input,</b> so such duplexers will employ multi-pole filters. Duplexers are commonly made for use on the 30-50 MHz ("low band"), 136-174 MHz ("high band"), 380-520 MHz ("UHF"), plus the 790-862 MHz ("800"), 896-960 MHz ("900") and 1215-1300 MHz ("1200") bands.|$|R
5000|$|For a receiver, the attack-time {{delay is}} defined as the time {{interval}} from the instant a step radio-frequency (RF) signal, at a level equal to the receiver's threshold of sensitivity, is applied to the <b>receiver</b> <b>input,</b> to the instant when the receiver's output amplitude reaches 90% of its steady-state value. If a squelch circuit is operating, the receiver attack-time delay includes the time for the receiver to break squelch.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the radio}} designer, intelligible speech can be {{detected}} 12 dB above the receiver's noise floor (noise and distortion). Regardless of how accurate this output power is regarding intelligible speech, having a standard output SINAD allows easy comparison between radio <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> sensitivities. This 0.25 μV value is typical for VHF commercial radio, while 0.35 μV is probably more typical for UHF. In the real world, lower SINAD values (more noise) can still result in intelligible speech, but it is tiresome work {{to listen to a}} voice in that much noise.|$|E
50|$|Their pulsed {{system used}} a new Philips {{magnetron}} with better frequency stability. It was modulated with 2-ms pulses at a {{pulse repetition frequency}} (PRF) of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was an array of 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative circuit used Acorn triodes from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching. A blocking device shut the <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> when the transmitter pulsed. For displaying the range, it had a Braun tube (a CRT), improved in the late 1920s by Manfred von Ardenne.|$|E
50|$|Radio channel emulators {{or radio}} channel {{simulators}} (also called fading simulators) are tools for air interface testing in wireless communication. In a test environment, radio channel emulators replace the real-world radio channel between a radio transmitter and a receiver {{by providing a}} faded representation of a transmitted signal to the <b>receiver</b> <b>inputs.</b> As technology moves forward {{to take advantage of}} more complex channel characteristics such as MIMO, the channel modeling needed to accurately emulate the radio environment becomes even more critical to a test setup. Radio channel emulators enable creation of mathematical models representing the physical radio signal transmission medium.|$|R
50|$|SATA {{physical}} coding uses a line encoding system {{known as}} 8b/10b encoding. This scheme serves multiple functions required {{to sustain a}} differential serial link. First, the stream contains necessary synchronization information that allows the SATA host/drive to extract clocking. The 8b/10b encoded sequence embeds periodic edge transitions to allow the receiver to achieve bit-alignment {{without the use of}} a separately transmitted reference clock waveform. The sequence also maintains a neutral (DC-balanced) bitstream, which allows the transmit drivers and <b>receiver</b> <b>inputs</b> to be AC-coupled. Generally, the actual SATA signalling is half-duplex, meaning that it can only read or write data at any one time.|$|R
50|$|If one is {{considering}} malicious adversaries, further mechanisms to ensure correct behaviour {{of both parties}} need to be provided. By construction {{it is easy to}} show security for the sender, as all the receiver can do is to evaluate a garbled circuit that would fail to reach the circuit-output wires if he deviated from the instructions. The situation is very different on the sender's side. For example, he may send an incorrect garbled circuit that computes a function revealing the <b>receiver's</b> <b>input.</b> This would mean that privacy no longer holds, but since the circuit is garbled the receiver {{would not be able to}} detect this.|$|R
50|$|In radio reception, {{noise is}} the {{superposition}} of white noise and other disturbing {{influences on the}} signal, caused either by thermal noise and other electronic noise from <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> circuits or by interference from radiated electromagnetic noise {{picked up by the}} receiver's antenna. If no noise were picked up with radio signals, even weak transmissions could be received at virtually any distance by making a radio receiver that was sensitive enough. In practice, this doesn't work, and a point is reached where the only way to extend the range of a transmission is to increase the transmitter power.|$|E

It was modulated with 2- μs pulses at a PRF of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was {{an array of}} 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative receiver used Acorn tubes from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching.

The term [...] "break" [...] derives from current loop signaling, which was the traditional signaling used for teletypewriters. The [...] "spacing" [...] condition of a current loop line is indicated by no current flowing, and a very long period of no current flowing is often caused by a break or other fault in the line.|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{conceptual}} {{design for the}} input optical system for a multi-object spectrometer operating at submillimeter wavelengths. The Mirror MOS {{is based on a}} sequence of mirrors that enables low-loss propagation of beams from selected positions distributed throughout the focal plane to the spectroscopic <b>receiver</b> <b>inputs.</b> This approach should be useful for observations of sources which have a relatively low density on the sky, for which it is inefficient to use a traditional array receiver with uniformly spaced, relatively closely packed beams. Our concept is based on assigning a patrol region to each of the <b>receivers,</b> which have <b>inputs</b> distributed over the focal plane of the telescope. The <b>input</b> to each <b>receiver</b> can be positioned at any point within this patrol region. This approach, with only 4 reflections, offers very low loss.

50|$|Pulse width also {{determines the}} dead zone at close ranges. While the radar {{transmitter}} is active, the <b>receiver</b> <b>input</b> is blanked {{to avoid the}} amplifiers being swamped (saturated) or, (more likely), damaged. A simple calculation reveals that a radar echo will take approximately 10.8 μs to return from a target 1 statute mile away (counting from {{the leading edge of}} the transmitter pulse (T0), (sometimes known as transmitter main bang)). For convenience, these figures may also be expressed as 1 nautical mile in 12.4 μs or 1 kilometre in 6.7 μs. (For simplicity, all further discussion will use metric figures.) If the radar pulse width is 1 μs, then there can be no detection of targets closer than about 150 m, because the receiver is blanked.|$|E
