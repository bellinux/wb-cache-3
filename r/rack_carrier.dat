50|$|Many road bikes, {{along with}} {{mountain}} bikes, include clipless pedals to which special shoes attach, via a cleat, enabling the rider {{to pull on}} the pedals as well as push. Other possible accessories for the bicycle include front and rear lights, bells or horns, child carrying seats, cycling computers with GPS, locks, bar tape, fenders (mud-guards), baggage <b>racks,</b> baggage <b>carriers</b> and pannier bags, water bottles and bottle cages.|$|R
50|$|Road touring {{bicycles}} have a frame geometry {{designed to}} provide a comfortable ride and stable, predictable handling when laden with baggage, provisions for the attachment of fenders and mounting points for <b>carrier</b> <b>racks</b> and panniers.|$|R
5000|$|In North America {{the vehicle}} {{attachment}} {{is known as}} the trailer hitch. Trailer hitches come in two main configurations: receiver type and fixed-drawbar type. Receiver-type hitches consist of a portion that mounts to the frame of the vehicle that has a rearward-facing opening that accepts removable ball mounts, hitch bike <b>racks,</b> cargo <b>carriers,</b> or other hitch mounted accessories. Fixed-drawbar hitches are typically built as one piece, have an integrated hole for the trailer ball, and are generally not compatible with aftermarket hitch accessories.|$|R
50|$|A stem is {{fastened}} to the worm and causes the stem to turn by attaching a gear, <b>rack</b> or stem <b>carrier</b> to the threading of the stem and pushing it through a stem-nut. This is the method used by Sanders in his 1865 patent.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the single wide form shown, M-Modules can be developed in double, triple and quadruple wide configurations. Because of the standard's genesis in the VME world it is sized such that 4 fit in a 6U module and 2 in a 3U module. Conveniently, {{because of the way}} other backplane standards have evolved, 4 units easily fit the front panel space in VXI and 6U cPCI/PXI while 2 will fit in the front panel space of 3U cPCI/PXI and up to 8 will fit in a 1U LXI <b>rack</b> mount <b>carrier.</b>|$|R
50|$|The moped chassis is {{constructed}} from two pressed-steel halves welded together down the centre-line, with pressed steel leading link fork front, and swingarm rear suspension with telescopic dampers. The under seat 3 litre petrol tank is single sided {{on the left}} of the machine. A plastic toolbox takes the position of a dummy fuel tank on the right hand side. Behind the single seat is a useful pressed steel <b>carrier</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In 1959, when 85ft flat cars {{capable of}} {{carrying}} two 40-foot highway trailers in trailer-on-flat-car (TOFC), or [...] "piggyback" [...] service were introduced, new automobiles began to be shipped by rail loaded on highway auto-carrier trailers. Eight to ten autos could be carried per flat car in this manner. By 1960 several U.S. railroads were handling new automobiles in this way, including the CB, C, CRIP, D, D, ERIE/EL, GN, KCS, L, MILW, MKT, MP/TP, NP, SL-SF, SP, SSW, WAB and UP. The New York Central, which used the Flexi-Van system of transporting only the highway trailer body without the wheel assembly, developed a Flexi-Van automobile <b>carrier</b> <b>rack.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{commuter}} bike is {{a hybrid}} {{designed specifically for}} commuting over short or long distances. It typically features derailleur gearing, 700c wheels with fairly light 1.125 inch (28 mm) tires, a <b>carrier</b> <b>rack,</b> full fenders, and a frame with suitable mounting points for attachment of various load-carrying baskets or panniers. It sometimes, though not always, has an enclosed chainguard to allow a rider to pedal the bike in long pants without entangling them in the chain. A well-equipped commuter bike typically features front and rear lights {{for use in the}} early morning or late evening hours encountered at the start or end of a business day.|$|R

40|$|The torque {{variator}} with permanent engagement of cogwheels is a planetary mechanism with two degree of freedoms. It has the superimposed differential constraint providing the certain motion of cogwheels under operation of forces. In automobile automatical boxes of transfers the differential constraint {{is used as}} the device having hydrodynamic adapting effect. That is connected with power losses. At passed time the materials of three World congresses under the theory of machines and mechanisms (Italy, Milan- 1995, China, Tianjin- 2004, France, Besancon- 2007) about effective mechanisms with differential constraints without power losses are published. In afforded work the {{torque variator}} having {{two degrees of freedom}} and differential constraint which is provided by geometrical parameters of cogwheels at absence of power losses on creation of adapting effect is considered. The variator contains input structural group with two degrees of freedom (<b>rack,</b> input <b>carrier,</b> satellite) and the joining kinematic chain with zero mobility (two blocks of the central cogwheels, output satellite, output carrier). The joining kinematic chain superimposes a differential constraint on relative motion of the input satellite. The geometrical parameters of cogwheels are such that the efforts transmitted to the input satellite by the joining kinematic chain, are not equal one to other. Equilibrium of the satellite at equality of input and output powers can take place only in motion at the account of speeds of application points of forces. The connection of acting forces with speeds of their application points by a principle of possible works defines the external differential constraint superimposed on motion of input structural group. In afforded work for gear variator the structure, the kinematics and the dynamics are considered. The discovered regularities open new possibilities of research and practical use in machine industry and in automotive industry. 2.

40|$|This topic {{deals with}} the {{fabrication}} and analysis of a stair case lift, which can be use as Material Handling System. A stair case lift is a mechanical device for lifting people and wheelchairs {{up and down on}} the stairs, who may find difficulty in doing so themselves. For sufficiently wide stairs, a rail is mounted to the treads of the stairs. A chair or lifting platform is attached to the rail. A person on the chair or platform is lifted as the chair or platform moves along the rail, old age and goods are to be carried across the stair case. Stair case lift is a type of lift that can be mounted on the stair case without altering civil structure. This lift runs on electric power and consists of a motor, reduction gear box, rope drive, two rails a sliding chair. In this system we use DC motor for changing the polarity of the power supply which will make the motor run in reverse direction connected with the earlier, while the later will form the entire assembly run to in downward direction, with the help of Toggle switches and push buttons. Advantages over the conventional hydraulic lift are no civil structure and alteration is required, low cost, less bulkiness, less power, less maintenance requires. Easy design, easy installations. Can be of industrial use too. Moreover, considering some drawbacks due to weight carrying capacity completely depend upon the capacity of motor. There is lot of scope for further modification in the project as using monorail instead of two. Use of belt drive or chain drive instead of rope drive. Incorporation and automation/ timer unit which will ease the use of device. <b>Rack</b> and <b>carrier</b> arrangement for using the device for curved stair case. Use of work & roller reduction gear assembly...|$|R
50|$|Cross bikes utilize a road {{bicycle frame}} {{similar to a}} racing or sport/touring bicycle, and are {{normally}} equipped with nearly flat handlebars {{to provide a more}} upright riding position than a racing or sport/touring bike. As a hybrid bike intended for general recreational and utility use, the cross bike differs from the cyclo-cross bicycle, which is a racing bicycle purposely designed to compete in the sport of cyclo-cross competition. Cross bikes are fitted with 700c (ISO 622) wheels using somewhat wider semi-treaded tires (1.125 - 1.25 in) than those fitted to most racing or sport/touring models.The additional tire width and tread is intended to give the cross bike hybrid some ability to deal with rough or littered surfaces that might be encountered on paved or unpaved bike trails, such as gravel, leaves, hard-packed sand, and shallow mud. Most cross bikes are biased towards moderate off-pavement use and light weight, and as such are not normally fitted with fenders, lights, or <b>carrier</b> <b>racks.</b> The larger 700c wheels are a little faster on paved surfaces and can give an advantage for longer trips or for touring purposes.|$|R
