25|$|Despite {{moving the}} long wave Daventry {{transmissions}} to Droitwich, {{and increasing the}} transmitters power, long wave reception from the Midlands remained poor in Cornwall. To this day, BBC Radio Four is not audible on long wave in most of Cornwall, and reception relies {{on a couple of}} low power repeater transmitters on medium wave (e.g. Lanner/Redruth MF on 756 kHz). Initially, the BBC National Programme replaced several local and regional services. However, although it launched BBC <b>Regional</b> <b>Programme</b> for the West in 1933, it transmitted it from the Washford transmitter. In the 1960s, it started an opt out from the then new BBC Radio Four (formerly the BBC Home Service during the morning daily news programme (Today), called Morning Sou'West. This opt out continued, long after other regional services had ceased on the BBC (only National services for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland remained). However, the opt-out stopped with the long-overdue launch of BBC Radio Cornwall and BBC Radio Devon on 17 January 1983.|$|E
