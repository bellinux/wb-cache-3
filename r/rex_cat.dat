50|$|The name Rex {{was taken}} from the Rabbit Fancy because the first <b>rex</b> <b>cat</b> breed to be developed, the Cornish Rex, has a coat similar to that of a rex rabbit, in that it {{comprises}} only the undercoat with no topcoat or guard hairs.|$|E
50|$|According to some claims, {{the first}} litters of {{typically}} Oregon-Rex-like cats occurred in 1944.

40|$|Malassezia spp. yeasts are {{commensal}} organisms of mammal and avian skin, {{but little}} is known about their presence on the skin of healthy cats. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of Malassezia spp. yeasts in feline nail folds and to identify the different species. Forty-six cats of different breeds were evaluated by cytological examination, and Malassezia spp. yeasts were seen in 61 % of them. Yeasts were found in 100 % of Devon <b>Rex</b> <b>cats</b> [mean 8. 63 /oil immersion field (high-power field - HPF) ]. Conversely, only 42 % of cats of other breeds (domestic short-haired and Persian) were positive (mean 0. 59 /HPF). Twenty-one cats of different breeds were subsequently evaluated by fungal culture. Malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from 52 %, M. furfur from 38 %, and M. sympodialis from 9. 5 % of the cats. More than one species was observed in eight of 21 cats, six of which were Devon Rex. Malassezia spp. yeasts are common inhabitants of feline nail folds, especially in Devon <b>Rex</b> <b>cats,</b> and the presence of a high number of yeasts on cytology correlates with the clinical observation of brown, greasy material in the nail folds. M. pachydermatis and two lipid-dependent species were isolated from both Devon <b>Rex</b> <b>cats</b> and cats of other breeds...|$|R

50|$|At {{the same}} time, the first Cornish Rex were {{imported}} to the U.S. from Great Britain, and were soon interbred with the developing Oregon Rex breed. Breeders from Oregon then established a purebred Oregon Rex which soon {{became one of}} America's most popular Rex breeds. In the course of breeding, however, all types of Rex cats—each of which differ genetically—were crossbred, and the Oregon Rex did not endure as a stand-alone breed.

50|$|The LaPerm is a rex breed which {{originated}} in the United States and is now present in many other countries worldwide.

50|$|A hypoallergenic cat is a {{cat that}} {{is less likely to}} provoke, or produce an {{allergic}} reaction in humans. Although the topic is controversial, owners' experience and recent clinical studies suggest that Siberian <b>cats,</b> Devon <b>Rex</b> and Cornish <b>Rex</b> <b>cats,</b> Abyssinian cats, Balinese cats, and several other breeds, especially females, are likely to have low levels of Fel d 1, the main allergenic protein.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>Rex</b> <b>cat</b> {{turned up}} in Berlin-Buch, {{apparently}} in the late 1950s. The tom named Schnurzel eventually contributed to German Rex breeding; {{it is not known}} how he related to Lämmchen but presumably he was a grandson of hers, as Scheuer-Karpin would let her cats roam free through the gardens and forests of Buch. Even in more recent times, the genetic legacy of Lämmchen if not Munk manifests itself on occasion in the Berlin area, such as Pumina, found as a stray inage of Preuss from Siegburg which {{turned up in}} 1979 in the Rhineland town of Siegburg {{does not appear to be}} related to be a German Rex proper; it is almost certainly not related to Lämmchen. Nonetheless, his descendants may have contributed to the German Rex lineage of today.|$|E
50|$|Despite some belief to the contrary, the Cornish Rex's {{short hair}} {{does not make}} it non- or hypo-allergenic. Allergic {{reactions}} from cats are not the result of hair length, but from a glyco-protein known as Fel d 1, produced in the sebaceous glands of the skin, saliva, and urine. Most people who have cat allergies are reacting to this protein in cat saliva and cat dander: when the cat cleans its fur, the saliva dries and is transformed into dust which people breathe in. Since Cornish Rex cats groom as much as or even more than ordinary cats, a Cornish <b>Rex</b> <b>cat</b> can still produce a reaction in people who are allergic to cats. However, it is widely reported to cause lesser to little allergic reaction. It is recommended a potential owner visit a cattery to check their own tolerance.|$|E
5000|$|It is not {{certainly}} {{known how}} Lämmchen relates to Munk, {{only that the}} German Rex mutation - on the same gene as in the Cornish Rex - is recessive, meaning it will only show when both alleles are [...] "Rex", and that Munk is the first thoroughly documented <b>Rex</b> <b>cat,</b> though as stories of [...] "children cuddling curly coated kittens" [...] attest, Rex alleles turn up every now and then. Presumably, Munk sired many offspring with local cats, none of which would have had curly fur as the allele of Munks straight-haired mates would dominate. In the following years, any curly-haired cats in the Königsberg area went unnoticed or at least were not bred on purpose; the allele nonetheless would have stood good chances {{to remain in the}} local cat population, as recessive alleles have a very low probability to disappear entirely.|$|E

40|$|An {{autosomal}} recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized by skeletal muscle weakness, fatigability and variable electromyographic or muscular histopathological features {{has been described}} in the two related Sphynx and Devon <b>Rex</b> <b>cat</b> breeds (Felis catus). Collection of data from two affected Sphynx cats and their relatives pointed out a single disease candidate region on feline chromosome C 2, identified following a genome-wide SNP-based homozygosity mapping strategy. In that region, we further identified COLQ (collagen-like tail subunit of asymmetric acetylcholinesterase) as a good candidate gene, since COLQ mutations were identified in affected humans and dogs with endplate acetylcholinesterase deficiency leading to a synaptic form of congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). A homozygous c. 1190 G>A missense variant located in exon 15 of COLQ, leading to a C 397 Y substitution, was identified in the two affected cats. C 397 is a highly-conserved residue from the C-terminal domain of the protein; its mutation was previously shown to produce CMS in humans, and here we confirmed in an affected Sphynx cat that it induces a loss of acetylcholinesterase clustering at the neuromuscular junction. Segregation of the c. 1190 G>A variant was 100 % consistent with the {{autosomal recessive}} mode of inheritance of the disorder in our cat pedigree; in addition, an affected, unrelated Devon <b>Rex</b> <b>cat</b> recruited thereafter was also homozygous for the variant. Genotyping of a panel of 333 cats from 14 breeds failed to identify a single carrier in non-Sphynx and non-Devon Rex cats. Finally, the percentage of healthy carriers in a European subpanel of 81 genotyped Sphynx cats {{was estimated to be}} low (3. 7 %) and 14 control Devon Rex cats were genotyped as wild-type individuals. Altogether, these results strongly support that the neuromuscular disorder reported in Sphynx and Devon Rex breeds is a CMS caused by a unique c. 1190 G>A missense mutation, presumably transmitted through a founder effect, which strictly and slightly disseminated in these two breeds. The presently available DNA test will help owners avoid matings at risk...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{identified}} a number of forms of muscular dystrophy, termed dystroglycanopathies, which are associated with loss of natively glycosylated α-dystroglycan. Here we identify a new animal model for this class of disorders in Sphynx and Devon Rex cats. Affected cats displayed a slowly progressive myopathy with clinical and histologic hallmarks of muscular dystrophy including skeletal muscle weakness with no involvement of peripheral nerves or CNS. Skeletal muscles had myopathic features and reduced expression of α-dystroglycan, while β-dystroglycan, sarcoglycans, and dystrophin were expressed at normal levels. In the Sphynx cat, analysis of laminin and lectin binding capacity demonstrated no loss in overall glycosylation or ligand binding for the α-dystroglycan protein, only a loss of protein expression. A reduction in laminin-α 2 expression in the basal lamina surrounding skeletal myofibers was also observed. Sequence analysis of translated regions of the feline dystroglycan gene (DAG 1) in affected cats did not identify a causative mutation, and levels of DAG 1 mRNA determined by real-time QRT-PCR did not differ significantly from normal controls. Reduction in the levels of glycosylated α-dystroglycan by immunoblot was also identified in an affected Devon <b>Rex</b> <b>cat.</b> These data suggest that muscular dystrophy in Sphynx and Devon Rex cats results from a deficiency in α-dystroglycan protein expression, and as such may represent a new type of dystroglycanopathy where expression, but not glycosylation, is affected...|$|E

40|$|Background: Multicentric {{squamous}} cell carcinoma in situ (MSCCIS) is an uncommon cutaneous disease of middle-aged to older cats, with some cases being linked to papillomavirus infection. The disease course is usually benign. Initial eruption of multifocal, pigmented, hyperkeratotic plaques is typical, with gradual progression to thickly crusted ulcerative lesions. Animal: A 5 -year-old male neutered Devon <b>rex</b> <b>cat</b> in apparent good health was initially presented with a 16 month history of over 40 nonpruritic dorsally distributed hyperpigmented patches. Lesions progressed gradually over 2 years to larger, more pigmented, crusted plaques and ulcerated nodules. At 7 years of age the cat developed neurological signs and systemic illness and was euthanized. Methods and results: Initial skin histopathology revealed discrete regions of epidermal and follicular epithelial hyperplasia, with moderate numbers of apoptotic keratinocytes, and mild focal epithelial dysplasia. A diagnosis of erythema multiforme was considered; feline herpesvirus- 1 immunohistochemistry was negative. Repeat histopathology 22 months after initial presentation confirmed MSCCIS with foci of invasive {{squamous cell}} carcinoma (SCC). Postmortem examination 1 month later revealed SCC within the thoracic wall, lungs and vessels of the thoracic spinal cord and heart base, presumed to be metastases from skin lesions. Fluorescent in situ hybridization of initial and later histopathology samples was positive for Felis domesticus papillomavirus type 2. Immunoreactivity of p 16 was prominent within early and late cutaneous lesions and internal SCCs. Conclusions: This case represents an unusual presentation of papillomavirus-associated MSCCIS with extensive lesions, atypical initial histopathology and progression to SCC with distant metastases...|$|E

50|$|The Sphynx hairlessness is {{produced}} by the same gene as the Devon Rex phenotype. Moreover {{it was found that}} the curly coat of Selkirk <b>Rex</b> <b>cats</b> is also associated with this gene. In detail the gene encodes Keratin 71 (KRT71) and is responsible for the keratinization of the hair follicle. The Sphynx mutation leads to a complete loss-of-function where the structure of the hair is damaged so that i.e. the hair can be formed but is easily dislodged. In the Devon Rex mutation a residual activity of the protein still exists. The Selkirk Rex allele (sadr) is dominant over the wild type gene, which is dominant over the Devon Rex allele (re) and the Sphynx (hr) which forms an allelic series of : KRT71SADRE > KRT71+ > KRT71re > KRT71hr.|$|R
