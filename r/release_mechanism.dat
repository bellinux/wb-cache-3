5|$|Block II {{had already}} been planned to use a {{completely}} redesigned hatch which opened outward, and could be opened {{in less than five}} seconds. Concerns of accidental opening were addressed by using a cartridge of pressurized nitrogen to drive the <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> in an emergency, instead of the explosive bolts used on Project Mercury.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescopic}} sight on the M6 and both elevation and traverse controls were {{located on the}} left side, so one gunner was able to aim the gun. The traverse gear had a <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> which allowed free movement of the barrel in case a quick traverse was needed.|$|E
5|$|A <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> was {{provided}} on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag. This rope was attached to ballast, {{so that it would}} also be activated automatically {{in the case of a}} catastrophic loss of ballast. Failure to attach this rope was to play a pivotal role in the loss of the Patrie.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} a number of <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> {{designed}} to be emergency backups. The idea behind these <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is that triggering them will cause something undesirable to happen, and thus are only used in situations where death or serious injury could occur otherwise.|$|R
40|$|A {{variety of}} order <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> have been {{developed}} for workload control. In this paper the effectiveness of order <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in a job shop environment is assessed by studying the influence of single order release dimensions, instead of comparing different mechanisms as a whole. In particular, the paper aims at improving the basis for selecting the workload accounting over time and the workload control strategies, through the understanding of its impact on the overall system performance. The robustness of these order release strategies to environmental perturbations is also assessed through a plan of experiments based on the Taguchi method. Simulation results provide important insights for the implementation of order <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms...</b>|$|R

5|$|The Barracudas were {{targeted}} by heavy, but inaccurate, anti-aircraft gunfire as they arrived over Kaafjord. Aside {{from the two}} aircraft whose pilots sighted Tirpitz, the 35 other dive bombers attempting to attack the ship were forced to aim at her gun flashes. These bombing attacks took 25 minutes to complete; seven near misses were achieved but no damage was inflicted on Tirpitz. One of the other Barracudas attacked an anti-aircraft battery, another attempted to bomb a destroyer and a third scored a near miss on the tanker Nordmark. Three of the remaining four Barracudas {{did not find any}} targets and jettisoned their bombs into the sea; the fourth was unable to drop its bombs due to a faulty <b>release</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket that binds small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design and}} analysis of a composite sandwich solar array panel with internal local stiffeners. The purpose of this investigation is {{the connection between the}} panel and the satellite structure. The application for this purpose is the Eu:CROPIS (Euglena and Combined Regenerative Organic-Food Production in Space) compact satellite. The <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> to be used are Frangibolts. A main design driver is the use of as few hold down and <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> as possible. This approach is well founded due to the resulting reduction in complexity of the on board computer, the harness and its connections. Furthermore, the reduction in <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> reduces the power consumption during the detumbling phase after launch. A finite element model is used to calculate the deformations, stresses and strains of the solar panel in different configurations. The numbers of hold down and <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (HDRM) as well as the layout of the internal panel stiffeners are investigated. The hold down and the bearing forces are evaluated under launch loads to examine the different array configurations...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the basic}} {{assumptions}} in past job shop research is that arriving jobs are immediately released to the shop floor for processing regardless of available job and shop information. In practice, jobs arriving at the shop are usually collected into a backlog file. Jobs are then <b>released</b> by some <b>mechanism</b> {{so that they can}} be processed within the time available before the due date. This study examines the effects of several <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> on the performance of a dual resource constrained job shop. The <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> differ in the amount and types of information used to make release decisions. Four <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are tested in conjunction with two dynamic, due date oriented dispatching rules, Modified Operation Due Date and Critical Ratio. The job shop environment is specified by two levels of due date tightness. A labor and machine limited job shop model was used to simulate the shop performance. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of a leading edge propeller blade reconfiguration system using Shape Memory Allow (SMA) muscles is presented. This work describes the design and testing of a leading edge flap, {{which is used to}} alter the local camber of a propeller blade. The leading edge flap is deflected by SMA wires housed in the blade and maintained in a fixed position with a shaft locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> A locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism</b> is utilized so that constant actuation of the SMAs is not required to maintain leading edge deflection. The profile at 70 % span of the propeller blade was used to create a two-dimensional blade for leading edge flap design implementation and load testing. Deflection of up to five degrees was obtained with the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The SMA muscles used to deflect the leading edge were actuated electronically through resistive heating and were controlled by a proportional/integral gain control algorithm with closed-loop feedback from a linear displacement sensor within the blade. With the final design of the leading edge flap and locking and <b>releasing</b> <b>mechanism,</b> a preliminary design for a three-dimensional propeller was created...|$|R

25|$|The spring {{release device}} {{was used in}} the past almost universally on {{trailing}} type plows with one to three or four bottoms. It is not practical on larger plows. When an obstruction is encountered the spring <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> in the hitch permits the plow to uncouple from the tractor. When a hydraulic lift is used on the plow, the hydraulic hoses will also usually uncouple automatically when the plow uncouples.|$|E
25|$|New {{infectious}} progeny virus are {{assembled in}} the cell nucleus. Papillomaviruses have evolved a mechanism for releasing virions into the environment. Other kinds of non-enveloped animal viruses utilize an active lytic process to kill the host cell, allowing release of progeny virus particles. Often this lytic process is associated with inflammation, which might trigger immune attack against the virus. Papillomaviruses exploit desquamation as a stealthy, non-inflammatory <b>release</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The design {{goal for}} <b>release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> is maximum {{reliability}} while offering an appropriate load rating. <b>Release</b> <b>mechanisms</b> can fail due to bio-fouling or corrosion that can impair {{the motion of}} its components, failure modes that designers try to counter by minimizing the count of moving parts subject to seizing or applying high torque to overcome resistance. But failures also occur due to factors of use and environment such as rigging and ocean currents or surge that can result in an entanglement of the device.|$|R

After hitting the bat, the ball may roll and rest in one of the marked run zones on the playing carpet (in which case the batsman obtains runs), or be channelled into the base of a fielder's statuette (in which case the batsman is deemed out caught). The batsman could also be out bowled (inc. played on) or hit wicket. Wides and byes may also be scored.|$|E
25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E

25|$|On 5 August 2008, two {{pilots and}} seven firefighters {{assigned}} to the Iron Complex fire in California's Shasta-Trinity National Forest, were killed when Carson Helicopters S-61N N612AZ crashed on takeoff. Of the 13 people reportedly on board, one other pilot and three firefighters survived the crash with serious or critical injuries. The NTSB determined that the probable causes were the following actions by Carson Helicopters: 1) the intentional understatement of the helicopter’s empty weight, 2) the alteration of the power available chart to exaggerate lift capability, and 3) the use of unapproved above-minimum specification torque in performance calculations that, collectively, resulted in the pilots’ relying on performance calculations that significantly overestimated load-carrying capacity and without an adequate performance margin for a successful takeoff; and insufficient oversight by the U.S. Forest Service and the Federal Aviation Administration. Contributing factors were the flight crew's failure to address {{the fact that the}} helicopter had approached its maximum performance capability on two prior departures from the accident site as they were accustomed to operating at its performance limit. Contributing to the fatalities were the immediate, intense fire due to a fuel spillage upon impact from the fuel tanks that were not crash-resistant, the separation from the floor of the cabin seats that were not crash-resistant, and the use of an inappropriate <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> on the seat restraints.|$|E

500|$|In maturity, the exoperidium {{at the top}} of the puffball sloughs away, {{revealing}} a pre-formed hole (ostiole) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape. In young puffballs, the internal contents, the gleba, is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the spores mature. [...] The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature. Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore <b>release</b> <b>mechanism</b> in L.pyriforme using high-speed schlieren photography determined that raindrops of 1mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact. A single puff like this can release over a million spores.|$|E
