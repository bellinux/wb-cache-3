40|$|Abstract—In {{order to}} {{accommodate}} larger amounts of re-newable energy resources, whose power output is inherently unpredictable, {{there is an}} increasing need for frequency control power reserves. Loads are already used to provide <b>replacement</b> <b>reserves,</b> i. e. the slowest kind of reserves, in several power systems. This paper proposes a control scheme for frequency restoration reserves with participation of industrial loads. Fre-quency restoration reserves are required to change their active power within a time frame of tens of seconds to tens of minutes {{in response to a}} regulation signal. Industrial loads in many cases already have the capacity and capability to participate in this service. A mapping of their process constraints to power and energy demand is proposed in order to integrate industrial loads in existing control schemes. The proposed control scheme has been implemented in a 74 -bus test system. Dynamic simulations show that industrial loads can be successfully integrated into the power system as frequency restoration reserves.

It is just to the south of Saskatchewan Highway 56. Due to structural concerns, the main building at the camp was closed in 2008. The northern area of the campsite has been preserved for wilderness camping. However, the camp is equipped with water, toilets, lighted parking, stove, fridge, clothes dryers and gas furnace. The lodge is 1000 sq ft in size. There is also a 500 sq ft bunk house which is heated, and is supplied with electricity. Swimming is available in the provincial park located within 7 km.

40|$|The {{electric}} power system must address two unique requirements: {{the need to maintain}} a near real-time balance between generation and load, and the need to adjust generation (or load) to manage power flows through individual transmission facilities. These requirements are not new: vertically integrated utilities have been meeting them for a century as a normal part of conducting business. With restructuring, however, the services needed to meet these requirements, now called ''ancillary services'', are being more clearly defined. Ancillary services are those functions performed by the equipment and people that generate, control, and transmit electricity in support of the basic services of generating capacity, energy supply, and power delivery. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has defined such services as those ''necessary to support the transmission of {{electric power}} from seller to purchaser given the obligations of control areas and transmitting utilities within those control areas to maintain reliable operations of the interconnected transmission system''. This statement recognizes the importance of ancillary services for both bulk-power reliability and support of commercial transactions. Balancing generation and load instantaneously and continuously is difficult because loads and generators are constantly fluctuating. Minute-to-minute load variability results from the random turning on and off of millions of individual loads. Longer-term variability results from predictable factors such as the daily and seasonal load patterns as well as more random events like shifting weather patterns. Generators also introduce unexpected fluctuations because they do not follow their generation schedules exactly and they trip unexpectedly due to a range of equipment failures. The output from wind generators varies with the wind. Storage technologies should be ideal suppliers of several ancillary services, including regulation, contingency reserves (spinning reserve, supplemental reserve, <b>replacement</b> <b>reserve),</b> and voltage support. These services are not free; in regions with energy markets, generators are paid to supply these services. In vertically integrated utilities (without energy markets) the utility incurs significant costs to supply these services. Supplying these services may be a significant business opportunity for emerging storage technologies. This report briefly explores the various ancillary services that may be of interest to storage. It then focuses on regulation, the most expensive ancillary service. It also examines the impact that increasing amounts of wind generation may have on regulation requirements, decreasing conventional regulation supplies, and the implications for energy storage...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the structural characteristics and profitability of Japanese Black Cattle feeding management in Kagoshima Prefecture, a main cattle feeding province in Japane. In this study, special attention has been focused on, (1) production costs and profitability, (2) factors contributing to profitability, and (3) estimation of production functions for beef production. The data used in this study were farm records of the Survey on Production Costs for Japanese Black Cattle for Fattening (fattening of castrated young cattle) in Kagoshima Pref., which was conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (MAFFJ) in 1980. The results of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Average herd size for cattle feeding operations was 6. 5 heads in 1982. Over two-thirds of the perators managed only one or two heads, and, less than 7. 7 percent of the operators had herds of 20 or more. 2. In 1980, the average fattening period was 15. 8 months and the daily gain was 0. 65 kg. Feed conversion tended to increase as herd size increased, and average feed conversion was 8. 5. 3. Cattle feeding operators in this area tended to use more feed per unit of live weight than the national average level, including both commercial mixed feed and self-supplied roughage. This feeding system resulted in low profitability in this area. 4. It was found that extending the fattening period did not always increase profitability. Profitability was found to be largely influenced by price fluctuations in feeder cattle and dressed carcasses. 5. High labor returns per day were accounted for by high values of the ratio of fed cattle price to total production cost, and vice versa. In order to increase profitability, cattle feeding operators in this area must decrease production costs by substituting roughage for concentrate. 6. The estimated elasticities for feeder cattle, feed, labor hour, and <b>replacement</b> <b>reserve,</b> estimated using tha Cobb-Douglas production function, were 0. 5959, 0. 2278, 0. 1324, and 0. 0576, respectively. The marginal productiviry of feeder cattle indicated that increaseing feeder cattle investment by one thousand yen increased gross income by 1, 409 yen. This suggests that selecting good feeder cattle is very important for increasing profitability in Japanese Black Cattle feeding management. 本稿では,和牛肥育経営の経済性を明らかにするために,全国最大の和牛産地である鹿児島県を中心として, (1) 生産費の構造と収益性, (2) 収益性影響要因,(3) 生産関数の計測に焦点をあてながら分析してきた. 資料は 1980 年の農林水産省｢肥育牛(黒毛和種の去勢若齢肥育) 生産費個表｣鹿児島県分である. 分析結果は以下のとおりである. (1) 鹿児島県における和牛肥育の概況を検討すると, 1982 年現在 8, 312 経営が 54, 440 頭を飼養し, 1 戸当たりの規模は 6. 5 頭である. しかし, 1 - 2 頭規模が 68. 4 %と大半を占め, 20 頑以上規模は 7, 7 %にすぎない. (2) 1980 年時点で肥育期間は 15. 8 か月,D. Gは 0. 65 kg,飼料要求率は 8. 5 である. 飼料要求率は大規模はど大きい傾向にあり,大規模経営における濃厚飼料依存度が高いことを示唆した. (3) 1 頭当たり第 2 次生産費は 604, 391 円,所得は 112, 872 円, 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は 6, 065 円である. 価格･生産費比率は 1. 03 と九州(1. 08) 及び全国(1. 10) 水準より低かった. 鹿児島県の場合他地域に比べて総じて生産費が高く収益性が低いが,その主な要因は自給粗飼料と購入濃厚飼料の代替が円滑でなく,配合飼料への依存度が高いにもかかわらずそれが省力化及び増体効率の改善に結びつかないところにあると思われる. (4) 肥育期間の延長と出荷体重の増大は必ずしも肉質の改善や収益性の向上に寄与していないように思われる. 素牛の価格変動や枝肉単価の変動は収益性に重大な影響を及ぼすことがわかった. (5) 価格･生産費比率は 1 日当たり家族労働報酬の有力な説明要因であり,肥育期間の延長はD.

500|$|The Tetrarch {{experienced}} several setbacks {{throughout its}} development and deployment with the Army and airborne forces. One {{of the major}} problems was {{the limited number of}} these tanks that existed after production ended in 1942, which particularly affected the airborne forces.

A Royal Armoured Corps report issued in December 1942 stated that approximately 50 Tetrarchs were available for use. In a [...] memorandum, dated [...] January 1943, by Major General George F.

This lack of sufficient <b>replacement</b> <b>reserves,</b> combined with a War Office report that some 287 airborne tanks would be required for the 1st Airborne Division and an unnamed airborne division to be formed in India, led to the Tetrarch's eventual replacement by the US M22 Locust.|$|R

40|$|Upward {{pressure}} on all mining operations {{is coming from}} the triple bottom line. To some extent this is being offset by the rise in mineral prices but this may or may not continue.

30|$|Active power {{reserves}} are always {{needed to keep}} the power system in balance and their amount also depends on the level of wind power penetration into the power system and on forecasted weather conditions. For example, extreme weather conditions may result in a loss of large amount of wind power within a few minutes, thus jeopardizing the reliability and the security of the power system operation [1]. Therefore, {{reserves are}} typically needed for fast conventional generating units to increase the system reliability and ensure the power supply security. According to European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E), the type of reserves for keeping the power system in balance can be classified as Frequency Containment Reserves (FCRs), Frequency Restoration <b>Reserves</b> (FRRs) and <b>Replacement</b> <b>Reserves</b> (RRs) [8, 9]. FCRs are activated automatically and locally within 30 s for constant containment of frequency deviations and to constant maintenance of the power balance in the whole synchronously interconnected system. FRRs are typically activated (manually or automatically) within 15 min, {{in order to maintain the}} active power balance in the power system and the power exchange with neighbouring power system on its schedule. RRs respond in several minutes up to hours and restores the FCRs and FRRs back to the required level. The total volume of FCRs in Continental Europe and Nordic region is ± 3000 and ± 600 MW, respectively [9]. However, as wind power impacts the power system operation, it is predicted that more reserves will be needed in the future to accommodate large amount of wind power into the power systems. In this study the power imbalance is controlled through FCRs and FRRs. Conventional and wind power plants provides the FCRs, while FRR is activated only by conventional power plants through AGC.|$|R
