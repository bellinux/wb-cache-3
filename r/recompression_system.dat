40|$|China Scholarship CouncilMicroalgae, {{one of the}} {{important}} biofuel producers, have received considerable attention recently. Dewatering is one of the bottlenecks for its industrialization due to the dilute nature of the suspensions and the small cell size. Traditional liquid-solid separation processes are not efficient for dewatering of microalgae suspensions. In this study, falling film evaporation was employed for dewatering of microalgae suspension, which is a popular process for concentrating heat sensitive materials. The heat transfer coefficient was as high as 9414. 20 W/m(2) K with mass flow rate of 0. 233 kg/s, Delta T of 1. 21 degrees C, and microalgae concentration of 60 g/L. The falling film evaporation process can be made highly energy efficient if it is coupled with Mechanical Vapor Recompression (MVR) or Thermal Vapor <b>Recompression</b> (TVR) <b>system.</b> Heat and mass transfer characteristics of falling film evaporation of microalgae suspension have been investigated here. This will provide the fundamentals for future feasibility study of utilizing the falling film evaporation in the microalgal industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|As an {{important}} production process, the evaporative {{concentration of the}} inorganic salt solution is extensively applied in the industry, and it is significant to investigate the energy saving potential of such evaporation systems. In the paper, taking the ammonium sulfate solution for example, the self-heat recuperation technology (SHRT) is utilized to design two mechanical vapor <b>recompression</b> (MVR) <b>systems,</b> and the relevant energy saving performance is analyzed. It is found that the designed systems, which are satisfied with SHTR, enable {{the recovery of the}} sensible and latent heat of the emission solution without any additional heat, and compared to the conventional three-effect evaporation system, the energy saving performance are more prominent. However, in view of the existence of the boiling point elevation (BPE) for the inorganic salt solution, a maximum reduction amplitude of 40 % of the energy saving performance for the double-stage MVR system is obtained compared with the single-stage MVR system. As a result, it is concluded that the only satisfaction to the SHRT is not enough, and the pattern of the MVR system should also be considered to ensure a prominent energy saving performance. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{application}} of self-heat recuperation theory (SHRT) in mechanical vapor <b>recompression</b> (MVR) evaporation <b>systems</b> when used to concentrate solutions with boiling point elevation (BPE). A nonlinear model is presented and {{used to analyze the}} advantages of heat recovery and multi-stage MVR over single-stage MVR. The model is then used to optimize the number of stages, evaporation temperatures, heat transfer temperature differences and stage concentration changes in relation to the compressor energy requirements. In comparison with single-stage MVR and conventional three-effect evaporation, multi-stage MVR with SHRT is shown to offer advantages when the number of stages is large, the evaporation temperatures are high and a large mass concentration difference between the outlet and inlet is required. However, the SHRT-based MVR system does not always yield energy savings when dealing with an inorganic salt solution with high BPE. A case study on concentrating a calcium chloride solution indicates that the SHRT-based MVR system uses more energy when the inlet mass fraction is over 38 % compared to the conventional three-effect evaporation technology.

40|$|Numerical {{experiments}} are conducted of turbulent supersonic axisymmetric wakes at Mach number M= 2. 46 and Reynolds number, based on free-stream velocity and base diameter, ReD = 1 x 10 (5). Direct numerical simulations (DNS) {{are used to}} study the effect of approach flow conditions, and of specific azimuthal modes, on the near-wake behaviour. To that end, DNS are performed with laminar and turbulent approach boundary layers, and additional turbulent approach flow DNS with reduced circumferential size are conducted to deliberately eliminate certain azimuthal/helical modes. DNS with turbulent approach flow show an increased turning angle and increased growth of the separating shear layer, leading to a shorter recirculation region, a stronger <b>recompression</b> shock <b>system,</b> and ultimately good agreement with experimental data at considerably higher Reynolds number. A similar wake structure is found for laminar and turbulent inflow conditions, giving {{further evidence of the}} wake structure being a consequence of the global near-wake instabilities and not a result of upstream conditions. Stability analyses of two-dimensional basic states are carried out by computing the temporal pulse response using forced Navier–Stokes simulations to investigate which azimuthal modes are dominant for fully turbulent wakes and how the stability behaviour is influenced by the choice of basic state. Using the time- and azimuthally averaged data from three-dimensional DNS with turbulent inflow as basic state, an absolute instability of the axisymmetric mode was found and helical modes m= 4, 5, 6 were found to be linearly most unstable, in contrast to results obtained earlier using an axisymmetric flow solution as the basic state. The addition of a turbulence viscosity in the forced DNS retains most of the stability characteristics but reduces the wavenumber of the linearly most-amplified modes...|$|R

40|$|The {{economics}} of four concentration processes utilized {{by the food}} industry were analyzed. The processes examined are: triple effect evaporation, mechanical vapor recompression evaporation, reverse osmosis, and freeze concentration. The analysis was conducted on a typical water system concentrated from 5 % to 30 % solids. It includes operating and fixed capital costs at three throughput levels. A comparison is also made with previously published data on concentration costs. The analysis of the fixed capital costs of the four systems shows the expected rise in cost from the triple effect evaporator through the vapor recompression, reverse osmosis, and freeze concentration systems. At a given water removal rate the vapor <b>recompression</b> <b>system</b> is 1 - 1 / 2 times as costly as the triple effect system, while the reverse osmosis and freeze concentration systems are 3 and 7 times as costly. However, these relationships change when manufacturing costs are considered.

The PRM is launched and recovered using a deck mounted A-frame crane called the Launch and Recovery System (LARS). Upon recovery, the PRM docks with the Submarine Decompression System (SDS) to allow transfer and decompression of personnel. The PRM, LARS, SDS, and associated generators and auxiliaries all compose the Submarine Rescue System (SRS). The SRS, approximately 183 tons, is installed aboard the VOO. The SRS was nominally designed for operation on the U. S.

The VOO may be any Offshore Supply Vessel (OSV), Anchor Handling Tug, or offshore barge that has the capacity to handle the SRS and is available in the area of a disabled submarine. Since the SRS must be rapidly deployed, potential VOOs must be quickly identified and evaluated for structural, stability and seakeeping suitability with respect to the requirements for the SRS. This thesis describes the theoretical background and development of a procedure intended to aid in the analysis and evaluation of potential VOOs for stability and seakeeping suitability.

40|$|Evaporation {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} and most {{important}} unit operations in the industrial sector. As it is also the most energy consuming area in any industry, research and development and improvements is a continuous process over the years. As also one type of evaporator, will be appropriate only for limited applications, there are numerous variations based on the scope of application which is very wide. Variations can be in design, material of construction, size, modularity, process placement, operating mode, arrangements etc. Many literatures and information are available detailing these various types, design and applications. But very few information is available comprehensively explaining the precise use of evaporations in each process with inlet and outlet concentration values. The main objective of this thesis work is, compilation of brief technical information on evaporator application in major processes and calculation of evaporation load to produce specific quantity of the final product in these industries.

Process solutions presented take a big step towards this vision, and will be a significant extension from today s solutions. The systems developed are able to process hydrocarbons from the wells into products with acceptable specification for transportation and further processing in a downstream system. The processes solutions includes liquid stabilisation, gas cricondenbar/cricondenterm control, and gas dehydration. In addition there is a brief evaluation of subsea heat and power production. Earlier research shows that partial stabilisation provides a significant simplification of the system, and a reduction in power consumption. This is confirmed by analysis presented in of this master thesis. The majority of process solutions presented in this study are therefore based on partial stabilisation. Further development of process solutions is done based on conventional topside processing and the two-stage subsea solution developed by Kraabøl (2015). The configuration of the <b>recompression</b> <b>system</b> for flash gas from the stabilisation process, is found to have significant impact on system complexity, and has been in centre of design. An assessment of equipment is presented, where ejectors and screw compressors where found suitable for flash gas recompression. Centrifugal compressors and pumps are found suitable for export of products. Use of absorption, adsorption, selective membrane, and expansion/cooling is evaluated for gas dehydration. The recommended solution is to use a glycol absorption system. The system has two co-current contactors with downstream separators. This system is robust and provides the lowest glycol circulation rate of the systems analysed. Lean glycol is imported from a host, and exported back as rich glycol for regeneration, to reduce complexity and power consumption subsea. In the end a system using dual screw compressors, with high operational flexibility is recommended. This system is able to operate with both lean and rich feeds, and can be also be used on an unmanned topside installation. For lean feeds, having a relatively low flash gas rate, a very simple, robust, and compact system, including a high pressure separator and dual ejectors can be used.
