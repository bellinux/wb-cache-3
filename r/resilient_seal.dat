New <b>resilient</b> <b>seal</b> designs are currently being fabricated and high temperature seal preloading devices are being developed as a means of improving seal resiliency. GRC has designed several new test rigs to simulate the temperatures, pressures, and scrubbing conditions that seals would have to endure during service. A hot compression test rig and hot scrub test rig have been developed to perform tests at temperatures up to 3000 F. Another new test rig allows simultaneous seal flow and scrub tests at room temperature to evaluate changes in seal performance with scrubbing. These test rigs will be used to evaluate the new seal designs. The group is also performing tests on advanced TPS seal concepts for Boeing using these new test facilities...|$|E

40|$|NASA is {{currently}} developing technologies for the 3 rd Generation Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) {{that is being}} designed to enter service around the year 2025. In particular, NASA's Glenn Research Center (GRC) is working on advanced high temperature structural seal designs including propulsion system and control surface seals. Propulsion system seals are required {{along the edges of}} movable panels in advanced engines, while control surface seals seal the edges and hinge lines of movables flaps and elevons on the vehicle. The overall goal is to develop reusable, <b>resilient</b> <b>seals</b> capable of operating at temperatures up to 2000 F. High temperature seal preloading devices (e. g., springs) are also being evaluated as a means of improving seal resiliency. In order to evaluate existing and potential new seal designs, GRC has designed and is installing several new test rigs capable of simulating the types of conditions that the seals would endure during service including temperatures, pressures, and scrubbing. Two new rigs, the hot compression test rig and the hot scrub test rig, will be used to perform seal compression and scrub tests for many cycles at temperatures up to 3000 F. Another new test rig allows simultaneous flow and scrub tests to be performed on the seals at room temperature to evaluate how the flow blocking performance of the seals varies as they accumulate damage during scrubbing. This presentation will give an overview of these advanced seal development efforts...|$|R
40|$|Alkaline wet cells {{employing}} {{manganese dioxide}} as de-polarizer were proposed {{as early as}} 1882 (1) and again in 1903 (2). Dry cells of this type were first described in 1912 (3) and were studied sporadically up to 1936 (4 - 8). As far as can be learned none of these early cells attained any form of commercial success. Renewed interest {{in all kinds of}} alkaline dry cells has been stimulated in recent years by the outstanding development of mercuric oxide dry cells by Ruben (9, 10) and their ensuing successflfl nmnufacture on a large commercial scale. In 1949, batteries containing new type cells using the alkaline-manganese dioxide system were first produced on a commercial basis. The alkaline-manganese dioxide cells ~ now on the market are called "crown " cells because of the use of crown-type caps. The construction is shown in cross-sectional view in Fig. 1. The manganese dioxide-graphite d polarizer mix (usually about 10 : 1 ratio) is pressed into a steel can which is spot-welded to the steel positive cap. A porous felt-type cellulosic separator holds the electrolyte in inmmbilized form and serves as a spacer between the anode and cathode. Amalgam-ated powdered zinc is pressed into the plastic ring and in contact with the tinplate negative cap to form a porous anode. The aqueous electrolyte is about 30 per cent sodium FIG. 1.

40|$|The Seal Team {{is divided}} into four primary areas. These areas include turbine engine seal development, {{structural}} seal development, acoustic seal development, and adaptive seal development. The turbine seal area focuses on high temperature, high speed shaft seals for secondary air system flow management. The structural seal area focuses on high temperature, <b>resilient</b> structural <b>seals</b> required to accommodate large structural distortions for both space- and aero-applications. Our goal in the acoustic seal project is to develop non-contacting, low leakage seals exploiting the principles of advanced acoustics. We are currently investigating a new acoustic field known as Resonant Macrosonic Synthesis (RMS) {{to see if we}} can harness the large acoustic standing pressure waves to form an effective air-barrier/seal. Our goal in the adaptive seal project is to develop advanced sealing approaches for minimizing blade-tip (shroud) or interstage seal leakage. We are planning on applying either rub-avoidance or regeneration clearance control concepts (including smart structures and materials) to promote higher turbine engine efficiency and longer service lives...|$|R
50|$|Push-to-pull, push-to-connect, push-in, push-fit, or instant {{fittings}} are {{a type of}} easily removed {{compression fitting}} or quick connect fitting that allows an air (or water) line to be attached, nominally {{without the use of}} tools (a tool is still usually required for cutting tubing to length and removal). These fittings act similar to the way regular compression fittings work, but use a <b>resilient</b> O-ring for <b>sealing,</b> and a grip ring to hold the (possibly grooved) tube in place. With metal tubing, a groove is needed to hold the tube in place. With PTFE tubing, the tube deforms around the grip ring.|$|R

The flat sealing element is permanently fixed to the end plate adjacent to a first end face of same facing the fuel cell and extends toward the second end face of the end plate. The fuel cell assembly comprises a fuel cell (2), an end plate (4) arranged adjacent to it, a sealing device (6) having a transverse seal and a longitudinal seal for effecting a seal with respect to a gas distributor (5), and a flat sealing element (12) such as a <b>resilient</b> flat <b>sealing</b> element, which is arranged between the sealing device and the end plate. The flat sealing element is permanently fixed to the end plate adjacent to a first end face of same facing the fuel cell and extends toward the second end face of the end plate. At an end adjacent to the second end face, the flat sealing element is permanently loaded by a preload force in a direction from the end plate toward the sealing device. A prestressing device is provided for impacting with the preload force. The preloaded means of the prestressing device is variable. The prestressing device has a cylindrical preload element. The flat sealing element interacts in a sealing with a sealing ramp. The transverse seal of the sealing device of an active sealing surface is developed for contact with the flat sealing element. The longitudinal seal of the sealing device projects in the area of overlapping through the flat sealing element. The end plate has a material reduced region adjacent to the flat sealing element, in which the flat sealing element is immersible during pressing against the active sealing surface. The transverse seal for the formation of the active sealing surface has running ramp surfaces or a curved surface to each other. The active sealing surface is formed by means of a sealing edge. The flat sealing element is applied over its total transverse extending on the active sealing surface. The flat sealing element extends over its total transverse extending of the end plate. The material reduced region enables immersion of the sealing element over its total transverse and is formed as a recess and/or stamp, which is formed {{in the direction of the}} first to second face of the end plate adjacent to the first face facing in the end plate. The material reduced region is formed between the end faces of the end plate. The active flat surface is formed by means of ceramic material. The flat sealing element is charged during immersion in the material reduced region against the direction of the second end face of the end plate adjacent to acted preload force. The flat sealing element forms a U-web element of a U-shaped seal. A first U-side of U-shaped seal is fixed between the end plates adjacent to the fuel cell and adjacent to the first face of the end plate. The U-web element of the U-shaped seal extends itself the first face in direction to the second face of the end plate outside the end plate. The U-shaped seal is impinged on end of the U-web element opposite to the first U-web element with the preload force in the direction of the end plate for U-web element by means of the prestressing device. The prestressing element is captured from the second U-side in connection with the end plate and/or the U-shaped web element...|$|R
40|$|Future {{reusable}} launch {{vehicles will}} require advanced structural seals. This includes propulsion seals along edges and hinge lines in hypersonic engines, and control surface seals for movable flaps and elevons on proposed reentry vehicles. Seals must remain in sealing engagement with opposing surfaces, for multiple missions, {{even though the}} seal gap may be opening and closing due to thermal and structural loads. To meet this requirement either the seals themselves must be resilient or {{there must be a}} resilient structural element behind the seals. Case Western Reserve University is working with NASA s Glenn Research Center to develop more <b>resilient</b> high temperature <b>seal</b> components and preloading devices. Results are presented for a finite element analysis of a canted coil spring that is being considered as a high temperature seal preloading device. This type of spring is a leading candidate due to its ability to provide nearly constant force over a large deflection. The finite element analyses were verified by comparing them to experimental results of canted coil springs of three different stiffnesses, measured at Glenn Research Center. Once validated the parameterized model was combined with a scripting algorithm to assess the effects of key spring design variables (wire diameter, coils per inch, cant amplitude, eccentricity, and spring width) on spring stiffness and maximum Von Mises stress to aid in subsequent design...|$|R
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} increases, the oil companies are forced to start {{oil and gas exploration}} in complicated and remote fields. When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed seal plugs is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and Bridge Plugs, is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of plug failure and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole seal plugs uses an elastomeric sealing element to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric sealing element. When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional a <b>resilient</b> elastomer <b>seal</b> with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide a seal with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed seal plugs shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide a gas tight seal for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the blow out preventer and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of plug failure shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{diversity}} of household adaptation, different classifications of adaptation measures have been constructed, but classifications of adaptive households are rare. Harvatt et al. (2011) categorized households into active and non-active types; non-active households respond with a do-nothing strategy {{as a result of}} denying the risk or living with it, whereas active households take reducing or changing measures. By classifying the measures undertaken by households, Thurston et al. (2008) categorize flood resistance and resilience measures into categories of temporary resistance (e.g. installing door guards), of permanent resistance (e.g. permanent flood proof external doors), of resilience without resilient flooring (e.g. raising electrics) and of resilience with <b>resilient</b> flooring (e.g. <b>sealed</b> floors). Linnekamp et al. (2011) categorize flood protection into individual actions, such as raising the level of own yards, and collective actions, such as assisting neighbours in undertaking protective measures. Classifications of adaptation measures and of households with regard to their adaptation behaviour also exist in studies on river flooding. Precautionary river flooding measures can be categorized according to their costs and efforts: low-cost measures (e.g. relocation of water-sensitive objects), medium-cost measures (e.g. flood-adopted interior fitting) and high-cost measures (e.g. flood proof air conditioning) are mentioned as household and household business measures by Kreibich et al. (2011). Adaptive behaviour can also be classified into protection against financial risks (by purchasing insurances), acquisition of information about precaution and precaution itself, by flood-proofing and retrofitting property (e.g. adapting use of building) (Thieken et al. 2007). An example of a classification of specifically structural protection measures is the one study carried out by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA London (2008)), which distinguishes between measures at property-level (e.g. against the entry of water into the house) and resilience (reduction of damaging by entered water). The classification methods applied in these studies differ; ad-hoc classifications are frequently used, whereas systematic approaches, such as statistical ones, have not been used extensively in the literature on household-level adaptation to coastal and river flooding.|$|R
