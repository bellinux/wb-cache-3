5|$|Lloyd's mirror generates {{interference}} fringes {{by combining}} direct {{light from a}} source (blue lines) and light from the source's reflected image (red lines) from a mirror held at grazing incidence. The result is an asymmetrical pattern of fringes. Interestingly, the band of equal path length, nearest the mirror, is dark rather than bright. In 1834, Humphrey Lloyd interpreted this effect as proof that the phase of a front-surface <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> is inverted.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{was troubled}} {{by the fact that}} his theory seemed incomplete, since it did not {{determine}} the direction of a spontaneously emitted photon. A probabilistic nature of light-particle motion was first considered by Newton in his treatment of birefringence and, more generally, of the splitting of light beams at interfaces into a transmitted beam and a <b>reflected</b> <b>beam.</b> Newton hypothesized that hidden variables in the light particle determined which of the two paths a single photon would take. Similarly, Einstein hoped for a more complete theory that would leave nothing to chance, beginning his separation from quantum mechanics. Ironically, Max Born's probabilistic interpretation of the wave function was inspired by Einstein's later work searching for a more complete theory.|$|E
25|$|In a {{more robust}} and {{expensive}} implementation, the returned light is split and fed to an interferometer, which detects {{movement of the}} surface by changes in the optical path length of the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam.</b> The former implementation is a tabletop experiment; the latter requires an extremely stable laser and precise optics.|$|E
40|$|Lateral {{displacement}} and its {{mechanism in}} asymmetric layered configuration are investigated. It {{is shown by}} the stationary-phase approach that displacements of both the transmitted and <b>reflected</b> <b>beams</b> can be positive as well as negative, and their magnitude can be greatly enhanced at transmission resonances. Numerical simulations show that for a well-collimated incident beam, if the norms of transmission and reflection coefficients are approximately constant within {{the peak of the}} angular-spectrum distribution of the beam, the transmitted and <b>reflected</b> <b>beams</b> can undergo lateral displacement without distortion, as long as the thickness of the layer satisfies a restriction. It is concluded that lateral displacement is not caused by beam distortion, but the result of reshaping the multiply transmitted (or <b>reflected)</b> <b>beams...</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{read only}} media (ROM), during the {{manufacturing}} process the tracks are formed by pressing a thermoplastic resin into a glass 'master' with raised 'bumps' on a flat surface, creating pits and lands in the plastic disk. Because {{the depth of the}} pits is approximately one-quarter to one-sixth of the laser's wavelength, the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam's</b> phase is shifted in relation to the incoming beam, causing mutual destructive interference and reducing the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam's</b> intensity. This is detected by photodiodes that create corresponding electrical signals.|$|R
25|$|In the {{reflection}} electron microscope (REM) {{as in the}} TEM, an electron beam is incident on a surface but instead of using the transmission (TEM) or secondary electrons (SEM), the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> of elastically scattered electrons is detected. This technique is typically coupled with reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} (RHEED) and reflection high-energy loss spectroscopy (RHELS). Another variation is spin-polarized low-energy electron microscopy (SPLEEM), which is used for looking at the microstructure of magnetic domains.|$|E
25|$|A simple linear {{polarizer}} {{can be made}} by tilting a stack of glass plates at Brewster's angle to the beam. Some of the s-polarized light is reflected from each surface of each plate. For a stack of plates, each reflection depletes the incident beam of s-polarized light, leaving a greater fraction of p-polarized light in the transmitted beam at each stage. For visible light in air and typical glass, Brewster's angle is about 57°, and about 16% of the s-polarized light present in the beam is reflected for each air-to-glass or glass-to-air transition. It takes many plates to achieve even mediocre polarization of the transmitted beam with this approach. For a stack of 10 plates (20 reflections), about 3% (=(1-0.16)20) of the s-polarized light is transmitted. The <b>reflected</b> <b>beam,</b> while fully polarized, is spread out and may not be very useful.|$|E
2500|$|Ground plane {{reflection}} {{effects are}} {{an important factor in}} VHF line of sight propagation.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of a Gaussian-shaped beam through {{a slab of}} optically denser dielectric medium in the air, a two-dimensional optical counterpart of the quantum potential well, is investigated in order to elucidate the negative lateral shifts of transmitted and <b>reflected</b> <b>beams.</b> It is shown that the locus of {{the peak of the}} beam inside the slab consists of two parts. One propagates backwards and seems to be the geometric reflection of the other that propagates forwards. But they are not continuous with the loci of the peaks of the incident and <b>reflected</b> <b>beams.</b> A restriction to the thickness of the slab is obtained that is necessary for the shape of the beam to remain unchanged in the travelling...|$|R
40|$|Light <b>beams</b> <b>reflected</b> off {{a mirror}} surface produce <b>reflected</b> light <b>beams,</b> {{as shown in}} Figure 1. This is called {{specular}} reflection. When the same light beams strike a diffuse surface such {{as a piece of}} white paper, the light reflects off the paper in all directions, so that a <b>reflected</b> light <b>beam</b> cannot be seen. This is called diffuse reflection. Both diffuse and specular reflection are illustrated in the video...|$|R

2500|$|Electromagnetic {{radiation}} is emitted by a light source and linearly polarized by a polarizer. It can pass through an optional compensator (retarder, quarter wave plate) and falls onto the sample. After reflection the radiation passes a compensator (optional) {{and a second}} polarizer, which is called an analyzer, and falls into the detector. Instead of the compensators, some ellipsometers use a phase-modulator {{in the path of}} the incident light beam. Ellipsometry is a specular optical technique (the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection). The incident and the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> span the plane of incidence. [...] Light which is polarized parallel to this plane is named p-polarized (p-polarised). A polarization direction perpendicular is called s-polarized (s-polarised), accordingly. The [...] "s" [...] is contributed from the German [...] "senkrecht" [...] (perpendicular).|$|E

The Colours {{of these}} Rain-bows succeeded one another {{from the center}} outwards, in the same form and order with those which {{were made in the}} ninth Observation of the first Part of this Book by Light not reflected, but {{transmitted}} through the two Object-glasses. For, first, there was in their common center a white round Spot of faint Light, something broader than the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> of Light, which beam sometimes fell upon the middle of the Spot, and sometimes by a little inclination of the Speculum receded from the middle, and left the Spot white to the center.|$|E
60|$|Scholium. If this Experiment and {{the former}} be {{conjoined}} and made one by applying a fourth Prism VXY [in Fig. 22.] to refract the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> MN towards tp, the Conclusion will be clearer. For then the Light Np which in the fourth Prism is more refracted, will become fuller and stronger when the Light OP, which in the third Prism HJK is more refracted, vanishes at P; and afterwards when the less refracted Light OT vanishes at T, the less refracted Light Nt will become increased whilst the more refracted Light at p receives no farther increase. And as the trajected beam MO in vanishing is always of such a Colour as ought to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the Paper PT, so is the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> MN always of such a Colour as ought to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the Paper pt. For when the most refrangible Rays are by a total Reflexion {{taken out of the}} beam MO, and leave that beam of an orange Colour, the Excess of those Rays in the reflected Light, does not only make the violet, indigo and blue at p more full, but also makes the beam MN change from the yellowish Colour of the Sun's Light, to a pale white inclining to blue, and afterward recover its yellowish Colour again, so soon as {{all the rest of the}} transmitted Light MOT is reflected.|$|E

50|$|The phase {{relationship}} of the two <b>reflected</b> <b>beams</b> depends {{on the relationship between}} the wavelength of beam A in the film, and the film's thickness. If the total distance beam A travels in the film is an integer multiple of the wavelength of the beam in the film, then the two <b>reflected</b> <b>beams</b> are in phase and constructively interfere (as depicted in the first figure). If the distance traveled by beam A is an odd integer multiple of the half wavelength of light in the film, the beams destructively interfere (as in the second figure). Thus, the film shown in these figures reflects more strongly at the wavelength of the light beam in the first figure, and less strongly at that of the beam in the second figure.|$|R

60|$|How the Colours in {{the ninth}} and tenth Experiments of the first Part arise from the {{different}} Reflexibility of Light, is evident by what was there said. But it is observable {{in the ninth}} Experiment, that whilst the Sun's direct Light is yellow, the Excess of the blue-making Rays in the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> of Light MN, suffices only to bring that yellow to a pale white inclining to blue, and not to tinge it with a manifestly blue Colour. To obtain therefore a better blue, I used instead of the yellow Light of the Sun the white Light of the Clouds, by varying a little the Experiment, as follows.|$|E
60|$|Obs. 10. When {{the beam}} of the Sun's Light was {{reflected}} back from the Speculum not directly to {{the hole in the}} Window, but to a place a little distant from it, the common center of that Spot, and of all the Rings of Colours fell in the middle way between {{the beam of}} the incident Light, and the beam of the reflected Light, and by consequence {{in the center of the}} spherical concavity of the Speculum, whenever the Chart on which the Rings of Colours fell was placed at that center. And as the beam of reflected Light by inclining the Speculum receded more and more from the beam of incident Light and from the common center of the colour'd Rings between them, those Rings grew bigger and bigger, and so also did the white round Spot, and new Rings of Colours emerged successively out of their common center, and the white Spot became a white Ring encompassing them; and the incident and reflected beams of Light always fell upon the opposite parts of this white Ring, illuminating its Perimeter like two mock Suns in the opposite parts of an Iris. So then the Diameter of this Ring, measured from the middle of its Light on one side to the middle of its Light on the other side, was always equal to the distance between the middle of the incident beam of Light, and the middle of the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> measured at the Chart on which the Rings appeared: And the Rays which form'd this Ring were reflected by the Speculum in Angles equal to their Angles of Incidence, and by consequence to their Angles of Refraction at their entrance into the Glass, but yet their Angles of Reflexion were not in the same Planes with their Angles of Incidence.|$|E
60|$|Obs. 1. The Sun shining into my darken'd Chamber {{through a}} hole one third of an Inch wide, I let the intromitted beam of Light fall perpendicularly upon a Glass Speculum ground concave {{on one side and}} convex on the other, to a Sphere of five Feet and eleven Inches Radius, and Quick-silver'd over on the convex side. And holding a white opake Chart, or a Quire of Paper {{at the center of the}} Spheres to which the Speculum was ground, that is, at the {{distance}} of about five Feet and eleven Inches from the Speculum, in such manner, that the beam of Light might pass through a little hole made in the middle of the Chart to the Speculum, and thence be reflected back to the same hole: I observed upon the Chart four or five concentric Irises or Rings of Colours, like Rain-bows, encompassing the hole much after the manner that those, which in the fourth and following Observations of the first part of this Book appear'd between the Object-glasses, encompassed the black Spot, but yet larger and fainter than those. These Rings as they grew larger and larger became diluter and fainter, so that the fifth was scarce visible. Yet sometimes, when the Sun shone very clear, there appear'd faint Lineaments of a sixth and seventh. If the distance of the Chart from the Speculum was much greater or much less than that of six Feet, the Rings became dilute and vanish'd. And if the distance of the Speculum from the Window was much greater than that of six Feet, the <b>reflected</b> <b>beam</b> of Light would be so broad at the distance of six Feet from the Speculum where the Rings appear'd, as to obscure one or two of the innermost Rings. And therefore I usually placed the Speculum at about six Feet from the Window; so that its Focus might there fall in with the center of its concavity at the Rings upon the Chart. And this Posture is always to be understood in the following Observations where no other is express'd.|$|E
