Two activities ((Methylase IIa and methylase III) were found to protect transforming DNA of H. parainfluenzae from the action of H. influenzae restriction enzymes. To determine the specificty of the protection, a procedure based on biological activity was developed for the separation and purification of the restriction endonucleases from H. influenzae strain Rd. Two endonuclease R activities presumably corresponding to Hind II and Hind III (P. H. Roy and H. O. Smith, 1973; H. O. Smith and K. W.

In this study, the plastid-lethal markers, glyphosate or phosphinothricin herbicides, were used to develop a selection scheme for plastids that circumvents the need for integration of an antibiotic <b>resistance</b> <b>marker.</b> The effect of selective agents on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) mesophyll chloroplasts was first examined by transmission electron microscopy. We found that at concentrations typically used for selection of nuclear transformants, herbicides caused rapid disintegration of plastid membranes, whereas antibiotics had no apparent effect. To overcome this apparent herbicide lethality to plastids, a “transformation segregation” scheme was developed that used two independent transformation vectors for a cotransformation approach and two different selective agents in a phased selection scheme.

Results: All <b>resistance</b> <b>markers</b> were found to be transferred to the recipient through conjugation and transformation, except for nalidixic acid.

Markers for chloramphenicol and streptomycin resistance were found to be most stable during various storage conditions.

Methods Cultures were sequentially subjected to increasing doses of atovaquone alone or in combination with cycloguanil and the cytochrome b gene was sequenced. Additionally, we investigated the parasite cytochrome b gene of a patient returning from Mali with Malarone ® treatment failure in vivo. Results All strains that survived atovaquone concentrations in vitro of 2 × 10 - 8 to 2 × 10 7 M showed the M 133 I mutation and one strain with the highest atovaquone concentration the additional mutation L 171 F. Sequencing of the in vivo treatment failure revealed a point mutation at codon 268 resulting in an amino acid change from tyrosine to serine. Based on the repeated emergence of mutations at codon 268, but no detection of alterations at codon 133 in vivo, we developed a detection method for the diagnostic of codon 268 polymorphisms as a potential atovaquone/proguanil <b>resistance</b> <b>marker.</b> A nested PCR with 3 different pairs of primers for the second round was designed.
