Other products include sulphuric acid and aluminium fluoride. Boliden owns and operates two zinc and two copper smelters and one lead smelter. The Kokkola zinc smelter in Finland is the second largest in Europe and the fifth largest in the world, and mainly produces an alloy used in the galvanising of thin sheet metal.

The Rönnskär copper smelter is located in the Swedish town of Skelleftehamn and its main products are copper, zinc clinker, lead and precious metals. The smelter, which produces sulphuric acid as a by-product of its operations, also produces metals from electronic scrap and other secondary materials. The Harjavalta copper smelter, located on the west coast of Finland, produces copper cathodes that are mainly sold to manufacturers of semi-finished goods. Other important products include gold, silver and sulphuric acid. The Bergsöe lead smelter outside Landskrona in southern Sweden extracts lead from scrap car batteries. Bergsöe is one of Europe’s four biggest players in the lead recycling industry. Approximately 60 per cent of the plant’s lead production is sold to the European battery industry, with the remainder used in the manufacture of <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet.</b>|$|E

The rain water samples were collected from three different <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet</b> types and ‘ages ’ at Dada Estate in Osogbo, Osun State. The different roofing sheets evaluated were iron zinc, Aluminum, asbestos (Adex). The samples were collected and analyzed using standard methods with adequate quality control measures. The ranges of values of the investigated parameters were; pH (6. 545 - 7. 20), Hardness (0. 250 - 3. 775 mg/l), TDS (0. 004 - 0. 023 mg/l), TSS (0. 580 - 0. 740 mg/l), Alkalinity (0. 01 - 0. 28 mg/l) and T.

40|$|Currently, urban heat island (UHI) {{phenomenon}} and building energy consumptions are becoming serious. Strategies to mitigate UHI and reduce building energy consumptions are implemented worldwide. In Japan, {{as an effective}} means of mitigating UHI and saving energy of buildings, highly reflective (HR) and green roofs are increasingly used. In order to evaluate the effect of roofs with high reflection and thermal insulation on the energy conservation of buildings, we investigated the roof solar reflectivity of the subject school in Osaka, in which the HR <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet</b> was installed on the roof from 2010. Thermal loads, including cooling and heating loads of the top floor of school, were calculated using the thermal load calculation software, New HASP/ACLD-β. Comparing the thermal loads after HR <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet</b> installation to previous, the annual thermal load decreased about 25 MJ/m 2 -year and the cooling load decreased about 112 MJ/m 2 -year.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{types of}} ethylene–propylene–diene monomer (EPDM) rubbers, namely an {{efficient}} vulcanized (EV) and a semiefficient vulcanized (SEV), {{have been used}} to produce devulcanizates in a continuous setup. The devulca-nizates are re-cured using the same recipes as for the virgin rubber. The influence of mixing it with virgin rubber com-pound, the addition of extra sulfur, the operating devulcani-zation conditions, and the excess of devulcanizing agent on the mechanical properties (hardness, tensile strength, and compression set) of the reclaim rubbers are studied. Most of the reclaims produced show slightly inferior mechanical properties compared to the virgin rubber. Surface imperfec-tion was observed on the devulcanizate with high devulcan-izing agent content. Excellent mechanical properties (all above the standards) of the reclaim were found when the devulcanized profile material was used (EV-EPDM) to replace the virgin one for application as a <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet</b> mate...|$|E

40|$|A {{building}} integrated photovoltaic thermal (BIPVT) {{system based}} on long-run metal roofing is being developed at the University of Waikato in partnership with Dimond Ltd., a long-run roof product manufacturer. The concept consists of a CNC folded metal <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet</b> with a central channel and a collector plate bonded to the <b>roofing</b> <b>sheet</b> to create a sealed channel for thermal fluid flow. PV laminates are bonded to the collector plate and inlet and outlet manifolds attached for thermal fluid distribution. When exposed to solar radiation the system generates heat and electricity for domestic and industry use. BIPVT manufacturing methods were investigated for creating the sealed channel for thermal fluid flow. Adhesives (ADH), resistance seam welding (RSW) and autoclaving (ATC) were considered the most suitable. Processes were designed for the three methods and investigated through economic analysis. ATC {{was found to be}} the best for production volumes greater than 20, 000 BIPVT panels per year as it has greater production capacity and lower capital investment payback time than ADH and RSW. ATC had a payback time of 0. 26 years for 90, 000 BIPVT panels per year at a 40 % mark up. However ATC has several technical challenges that need to be overcome whereas ADH and RSW are proven production methods. ADH is more suitable for low production volumes below 20, 000 panels per year as it has a low capital cost compared to RSW and ATC and can be readily optimised when increased production is required. Cost savings can be achieved by reducing material costs as they were 95 % of the total operating costs for all methods. ADH and RSW could be readily optimised to increase production at lower capital expenditure by installing additional equipment at production bottlenecks rather than installing new production lines. ATC could not be as readily optimised as it has high production capacities. Installing a low volume BIPVT production facility into Dimond Ltd. could potentially generate an additional $ 3. 5 million per year in profit, for a process that produces 7, 680 panels a year. Payback time for the capital investment including a PV laminator would be just over half a year making BIPVT an attractive possibility...|$|E
