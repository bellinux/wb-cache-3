Due to data restrictions, China’s relative exports (to the US, Argentina, Japan, Korea, the UK, Germany, and Spain) will be compared to Mexico’s exports for a number of sectors over a limited period of eleven years.

40|$|Abstract Background Currently {{real time}} PCR {{is the most}} precise method by which to measure gene expression. The method generates {{a large amount of}} raw {{numerical}} data and processing may notably influence final results. The data processing is based either on standard curves or on PCR efficiency assessment. At the moment, the PCR efficiency approach is preferred in relative PCR whilst the standard curve is often used for absolute PCR. However, there are no barriers to employ standard curves for relative PCR. This article provides an implementation of the standard curve method and discusses its advantages and limitations in <b>relative</b> <b>real</b> time PCR. Results We designed a procedure for data processing in <b>relative</b> <b>real</b> time PCR. The procedure completely avoids PCR efficiency assessment, minimizes operator involvement and provides a statistical assessment of intra-assay variation. The procedure includes the following steps. (I) Noise is filtered from raw fluorescence readings by smoothing, baseline subtraction and amplitude normalization. (II) The optimal threshold is selected automatically from regression parameters of the standard curve. (III) Crossing points (CPs) are derived directly from coordinates of points where the threshold line crosses fluorescence plots obtained after the noise filtering. (IV) The means and their variances are calculated for CPs in PCR replicas. (V) The final results are derived from the CPs' means. The CPs' variances are traced to results by the law of error propagation. A detailed description and analysis of this data processing is provided. The limitations {{associated with the use of}} parametric statistical methods and amplitude normalization are specifically analyzed and found fit to the routine laboratory practice. Different options are discussed for aggregation of data obtained from multiple reference genes. Conclusion A standard curve based procedure for PCR data processing has been compiled and validated. It illustrates that standard curve design remains a reliable and simple alternative to the PCR-efficiency based calculations in <b>relative</b> <b>real</b> time PCR. </p...|$|R
40|$|In {{a number}} of {{influential}} recent papers, Taylor (1979 a, b; 1980 a, b) has analyzed the behaviour of an economy characterized by staggered over-lapping wage contracts and rational expectations. His model has the "Keynesian" feature that the second moment of the distribution function of real output is not invariant under changes in the deterministic (and known) components of monetary policy rules. The {{reason for this is}} the inertia in the money wage process induced by the staggered multi-period contracts and the assumption that the wage payments due in any given period under the contract are not "indexed", that is not made contingent on the actually realized values of such nominal variables as the general price level. We retain the crucial assumption of multi-period (staggered) non-contingent contracts but wish to examine the consequences of altering Taylor's assumption that wage bargainers are influenced by relative money wages rather than <b>relative</b> <b>real</b> wages. In Taylor's model money wage contracts are negotiated without reference to past, current and expected future prices. Our suggested modification that wage bargainers are influenced by <b>relative</b> <b>real</b> wages, which we consider somewhat more plausible, has some interesting implications for the empirical estimation of models with staggered wage contracts (see especially Taylor, 1980 b). ...|$|R

The method is expected to be more consistent as it predetermines the areas of the reservoir with homogeneous permeability distribution based on sensitivity analysis. To improve the accuracy of simulation results, grid blocks having wells completed in them were not combined with any neighboring grid blocks. Further, two scenarios were tested; one in which all neighboring grid blocks with equal permeabilities but without any well were combined, and the second in which wellblocks and their neighbors were not combined. The second scenario was done to improve the accuracy of the variables obtained from the wells. If the neighbors of a wellblock are much larger in size than the wellblock, the accuracy of variables such as wellbore pressure and water cut may be compromised.|$|R
