25|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forging</b> is {{a process}} where round or flat bar stock is reduced in {{thickness}} and increased in length. <b>Roll</b> <b>forging</b> is performed using two cylindrical or semi-cylindrical rolls, each containing one or more shaped grooves.

50|$|Mechanical presses {{function}} {{by using}} cams, cranks or toggles {{to produce a}} preset (a predetermined force at a certain location in the stroke) and reproducible stroke. Due {{to the nature of}} this type of system difference forces are available at different stroke positions. Mechanical presses are faster than their hydraulic counterparts (up to 50 strokes per minute). Their capacities range from 3 to 160 MN (300 to 18,000 tons). Hydraulic presses use fluid pressure and a piston to generate force. The advantages of a hydraulic press over a mechanical press is its flexibility and greater capacity. The disadvantages are that they are slower, larger and more costly to operate.The <b>roll</b> <b>forging,</b> upsetting, and automatic hot forging processes all use specialized machinery.|$|E

50|$|Crankshafts can {{be forged}} from a steel bar usually through <b>roll</b> <b>forging</b> or cast in ductile steel. Today {{more and more}} {{manufacturers}} tend to favor the use of forged crankshafts due to their lighter weight, more compact dimensions and better inherent damping. With forged crankshafts, vanadium microalloyed steels are mostly used as these steels can be air cooled after reaching high strengths without additional heat treatment, with exception to the surface hardening of the bearing surfaces. The low alloy content also makes the material cheaper than high alloy steels. Carbon steels are also used, but these require additional heat treatment to reach the desired properties. Iron crankshafts are today mostly found in cheaper production engines (such as {{those found in the}} Ford Focus diesel engines) where the loads are lower. Some engines also use cast iron crankshafts for low output versions while the more expensive high output version use forged steel.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of ultrafine-grained structures was studied in a 316 L stainless steel during severe plastic deformation. The steel samples were processed up {{to a total}} amount of strain of 4 at ambient temperature using two different methods, i. e., multidirectional forging and unidirectional bar rolling. The large strain developed upon cold working resulted mechanical twinning and partial martensitic transformation. The latter was readily developed during multidirectional forging. After straining to {{the total amount of}} strain of 4, the austenite fractions comprised approximately- 0. 45 as well as 0. 15 in the <b>rolled</b> and <b>forged</b> samples, respectively.

40|$|As {{a result}} of high {{localized}} plastic deformation experienced during proof testing in an International Space Station connecting module, a study was undertaken to determine the deformation response of a 2219 -T 851 <b>roll</b> <b>forging.</b> After prestraining 2219 -T 851 Al specimens to simulate strains observed during the proof testing, creep tests were conducted in the temperature range from ambient temperature to 107 C (225 F) at stress levels approaching the ultimate tensile strength of 2219 -T 851 Al. Strain-time histories and strain rate responses were examined. The strain rate response was extremely high initially, but decayed rapidly, spanning as much as five orders of magnitude during primary creep. Select specimens were subjected to incremental step loading and exhibited initial creep rates of similar magnitude for each load step. Although the creep rates decreased quickly at all loads, the creep rates dropped faster and reached lower strain rate levels for lower applied loads. The initial creep [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose of {{this article}} was to {{introduce}} a new method of forging which is called “Cross Die Forging”. In this method, the required force (load) is reduced to the greatest possible degree through elimination of flash channel; however, this would also decrease the positive effect of flash channel, namely filling the gaps and pores within the mold. Cross die forging procedure provides a way for providing a better preform design which ensures that the mold is filled without allowing the material to enter the flash channel. This method has been invented based on the need to decrease the production costs and to use lower tonnage pressing devices for production of heavy parts. This method is an economical method only for parts that: A) Has at least one plane of symmetry and the two ends that are perpendicular to the symmetry plane are flat; B) Has a weight that makes it impossible to be manufactured by rolling or <b>roll</b> <b>forging</b> processes. Examples of such parts are valve’s body, T-junctions, etc...|$|E
