40|$|In {{the context}} of Indonesia, fiscal {{decentralisation}} causes variation in <b>local</b> <b>government</b> financial condition. Some <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> experience financial problems, but some others are not. Such variation creates the need for <b>local</b> <b>government</b> stakeholders to have an effective instrument to monitor the soundness <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in managing finance (i. e planning, budgeting, executing, and monitoring). In addition, the stakeholders {{need to know what}} factors determine the variation in financial condition. Until now, in Indonesia, stakeholders have faced difficulties in knowing the soundness <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> financial conditions. The difficulties of knowing the financial condition <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> are due to lack of agreement about an effective assessment model and lack of uniformity in financial condition indicators (Chaney et al., 2002; Honadle, 2003; Kloha, et al., 2005 b; Wang et al., 2007). Furthermore, there is little empirical evidence about the factors affecting the financial condition <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>government</b> (Dennis, 2004; Jones & Walker, 2007). Therefore, the objectives of this study are, firstly, to develop an instrument to measure the financial condition <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments</b> in Indonesia and, secondly, to determine factors affecting financial condition <b>of</b> <b>local</b> <b>governments...</b>|$|R
