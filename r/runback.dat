5|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the regular season, the Virginia Tech defense {{was one of the best}} in the country. It was No. 4 in scoring defense (allowing 12.9 points per game), No. 11 in rushing defense (allowing 102.2 yards per game), and No. 7 in total defense (284.9 yards per game). The Hokies had 23 interceptions during the regular season, second-most in the country and behind only USC's 24 interceptions. The Hokies also found success on special teams defense. In total, Tech blocked ten kicks during the regular season: six punts, two field-goal attempts and two point-after tries. Tech's defense also scored 52 points: eight touchdowns, a safety and a two-point <b>runback</b> of an intercepted conversion pass.|$|E
5|$|On October 8, 2008, the Steelers {{played the}} Jacksonville Jaguars at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium. At {{that point of}} their season, the Jaguars were 2-2-0, and feeling very hopeful for the season {{following}} a defeat at home of their division rival Indianapolis Colts. The game was very close going into the second half, and the Steelers were still stinging from a Mathis interception and <b>runback</b> for a touchdown. Shortly {{after the start of}} the third quarter, Jaguars mascot Jaxson de Ville stood alongside some cheerleaders, and produced a Terrible Towel, which he used to rub his armpits and buttocks. Shortly after that, the Steelers ran away with the game and the Jaguars lost 26-21. The Jaguars went on to lose eight of their remaining eleven games in the season.|$|E

5000|$|High {{schools that}} {{follow the rules}} of the National Federation of State High School Associations (all U.S. high schools except those in Texas and Massachusetts, which use NCAA rules instead) do not allow {{defensive}} <b>runbacks</b> of recovered conversion attempts, and any recovery of the ball by the defense during the try is immediately blown dead and ruled merely as [...] "no good".|$|R
5000|$|Football {{associations}} {{differ on}} their own specific definitions of the term. The National Collegiate Athletic Association, for example, defines the term as [...] "the combined net yards gained by rushing, receiving, interception (and fumble) returns, punt returns, kickoff returns and <b>runbacks</b> of field goal attempts. All-purpose yardage does not include forward passing yardage" [...] (at pg. 206). [...] The National Football League (NFL), however, defines combined net yards as [...] "Rushing, receiving, interception returns, punt returns, kickoff returns, and fumble returns". [...] Neither of these totals makes clear how they record yards from blocked punts recovered, blocked field goals, and missed field goal returns.|$|R
25|$|Taylor {{produced}} a historic season during his final year at Miami that culminated with {{a plethora of}} honors and awards. He was named a unanimous first-team All-American, the Big East Conference Defensive Player of the Year and {{a finalist for the}} Jim Thorpe Award, given to the nation's best defensive back. He led the Big East Conference and ranked first nationally in interceptions with 10, tying the record for interceptions in a season with former Hurricanes standout Bennie Blades. Taylor also finished first in total tackles with 77 (57 solo). He intercepted two passes in Miami's impressive 28-14 win over Pittsburgh, playing a key role as the Hurricanes limited All-American receiver Larry Fitzgerald to just three receptions for 26 yards. He returned interceptions for an average of 18.4 yards, including a 67-yard touchdown return at Boston College, a 50-yard scoring <b>runback</b> at Florida State and a 44-yard scoring <b>runback</b> against Rutgers University. His three touchdown returns of interceptions is a Miami single-season record.|$|E
25|$|The {{game was}} notable for its ending; Auburn tied the game 28–28 with 32 seconds {{remaining}}. With one second remaining in regulation, Alabama missed a 57-yard field goal. Auburn's Chris Davis caught the errant kick {{and returned it}} 100 yards (under NCAA rules) to the opposite end zone, scoring a touchdown; the <b>runback</b> tied LSU's Odell Beckham Jr.'s record-setting 100 yard return that same season.|$|E
25|$|Two {{batches of}} new cars were {{obtained}} for the extensions built or being built, Carlton, Derby Road and Arnold.

They were mounted on Brill 21E wide wing trucks, had 2x40 h.p. Dick, Kerr motors, Dick, Kerr equipment with D.B.I. controllers and, besides the usual brakes (hand, rheostatic and <b>runback),</b> they had Cole, Marchint and Morley air slipper brakes. These cars were 64-seaters.|$|E
50|$|The {{next two}} weeks (losses to both Baltimore and Seattle) saw Schaub throw three interceptions, {{including}} two 'pick-sixes' (interceptions returned for touchdowns on the <b>runbacks).</b> In the following week against the San Francisco 49ers, Schaub threw three interceptions, including a pick-six on his first pass attempt of the game. With that pick-six, Schaub had thrown a pick-six in four consecutive games, an NFL record. In Week 6 against the Rams, Schaub was injured during the game, but his replacement T. J. Yates threw another pick-6 to stretch the team total to five games. Despite recovering from an injured ankle, Schaub was benched in Week 7 in favor of Case Keenum. Keenum started {{for the remainder of}} the season until he suffered a thumb injury, and Schaub became the starter in Weeks 16 and 17. For the 2013 season, Schaub played in 10 games with 2,310 passing yards, 10 touchdowns, and 14 interceptions.|$|R
5000|$|In American football, the {{formation}} {{was developed by}} Lorin F. Deland and first introduced by Harvard in a collegiate game against Yale in 1892. Teammates would lock themselves together with the ball carrier using their hands and arms and rush forward. But despite its practicality, it was outlawed two seasons later in 1894 because of its contribution to serious injury. Nevertheless its concept continued to influence several football plays in the modern game until 2009 when NFL league owners agreed to strengthen its use. Recent changes in the rules at various levels regarding <b>runbacks</b> of free kicks are stricter still in that they restrict blocking by teammates close together even without touching each other. The [...] "wedge" [...] commonly referred to in interference on free kick returns simply meant such a close group of blockers. Wedge blocking using only the shoulders to push forward teammates not holding the ball is still legal. Professional and Canadian football went still farther in theoretically not allowing any transfer of momentum between teammates in blocking but that prohibition is not strictly enforced.|$|R
40|$|D. Ing. The thesis {{describes}} the development, installation, {{and testing of}} a neural network-based steam temperature controller for power plant boilers. Attention is focussed on the mechanical and thermodynamic aspects of the control problem, on the modelling and control aspects of the neural network solution, and on the practical and operational aspects of its implementation. A balance between theoretical and practical considerations is strived for. Experimental data is obtained from an operational coal fired power plant. As a starting point, the importance of good steam temperature control is motivated. The sensitivity of heated elements in boilers to changes in heat distribution is emphasized, and it is shown how various factors influence the heat distribution. The difficulties associated with steam temperature control are discussed, and an overview of developments in advanced steam temperature control on power plant boilers is given. The suitability of neural networks for process modelling and control are explored and the error backpropagation technique is shown to be well suited to the steam temperature control problem. A series of live plant tests to obtain modelling data is described and specific attention is given to discrepancies in the results. The prOcess of selecting the ideal network topology is covered and improvements in modelling accuracy by selecting different model output schemes are shown. The requirements for improving steam temperature control are listed and the philosophy of optimal heat distribution (OHD) control is introduced. Error backpropagation through the heat transfer model is utilized in an optimizer to calculate control actions to various fire-side elements. The scheme is implemented on a power boiler. It is shown that the optimizer manipulates control elements as expected. Problems with fuel-topressure oscillations and erroneous fuel flow measurement are discussed. Due to process oscillations caused by OHD control, a reduction in control quality is evident during mill trips and capability load <b>runbacks.</b> Substantial improvements over normal PID control however, are evident during load ramps...|$|R
25|$|The game {{seemed to}} be {{slipping}} away from Miami, particularly as {{they were forced to}} punt on their next possession and receiver Al Edwards returned the ball 17 yards. However, Edwards lost a fumble on the <b>runback,</b> which punter Reggie Roby recovered on the Bills 47. The Dolphins then made another big play when Marino completed a 38-yard pass to Duper on fourth down and 5 from the 42, and with just 27 seconds left on the clock, Marino scored on a 2-yard touchdown run, cutting the deficit to 27-17 at halftime.|$|E

25|$|A short kickoff by Akers {{and a good}} <b>runback</b> by return man DJ Ware {{gave the}} Giants the ball on their own 35-yard line, and a pass from Manning to Manningham and three {{straight}} runs by Bradshaw gave the Giants two first downs, forcing the Eagles to use all three of their timeouts. However, on second and six from the Eagles' 38-yard line, T David Diehl committed a false start penalty, backing the Giants up to second and 11. A three-yard run by Bradshaw and an incomplete pass by Manning on third down left the Giants just outside Tynes' range for a field goal and forced the Giants to punt. The ensuing fair catch by Maclin gave the Eagles the ball at their own 12-yard line with 3:01 remaining in the game.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the first}} three drives of the game ended with punts, Green Bay opened up the scoring with Aaron Rodgers's 29-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson, who managed to pull slightly ahead of cornerback William Gay {{enough to make a}} leaping catch and fall into the end zone. Then on the first play after the ensuing kickoff, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was hit by Howard Green as he threw a pass, causing the ball to go well short of his intended target near the left sideline where it was intercepted by Nick Collins and returned 37yards for a touchdown, giving Green Bay a 14–0 lead. This score continued the unbeaten streak of Super Bowl victories recorded by teams scoring on an interception <b>runback,</b> improving to 11–0 in such games. It was also the third consecutive Super Bowl with an interception return for a touchdown, as well as the eighth such score in the last ten Super Bowls.
