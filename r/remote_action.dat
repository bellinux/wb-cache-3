40|$|This {{study focused}} on {{products}} of the bovine Mx 1 gene as specific markers for acute viral infections. The rationale {{for this is the}} fact that viral infections are commonly paralleled by the synthesis, release, and <b>remote</b> <b>action</b> of alpha/beta interferons (IFN-α/β). Released IFN-α/β act through specific receptors present on nucleated cells to transduce signals for the transcription of numerous IFN-regulated genes, such as the ones for double-stranded-RNA-dependent protein kinase, 2 ′- 5 ′-oligoadenylate synthetase, or the Mx proteins. In this study, cultured MDBK cells and bovine white blood cells (WBC) were treated with recombinant IFN-α or infected with either bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV- 1) or bovine rotavirus (BRV). Treatment of cultured cells with IFN-α was followed within 4 h by a time- and dose-dependent accumulation of intracytoplasmic Mx protein as revealed by immunostaining and Western blot immunoassay. This was preceded by a distinct rise of Mx mRNA in similarly treated cells, as revealed by a newly established quantitative TaqMan PCR technique. The two viruses displayed a cell-dependent in vitro ability to induce Mx proteins, which was limited to bovine WBC with BHV- 1 and to MDBK cells with BRV.

40|$|Semantic {{knowledge}} about objects entails both {{knowing how to}} grasp an object (grip-related knowledge) {{and what to do}} with an object (goal-related knowledge). Considerable evidence suggests a hierarchical organization in which specific hand-grips in action execution are most often selected to accomplish a <b>remote</b> <b>action</b> goal. The present study aimed to investigate whether a comparable hierarchical organization of semantic knowledge applies to the recognition of other’s object-directed actions as well. Correctness of either the Grip (hand grip applied to the object) or the Goal (end-location at which an object was directed) were manipulated independently in two experiments. In Experiment 1, subjects were required to attend selectively to either the correctness of the grip or the goal of the observed action. Subjects were faster when attending to the goal of the action and a strong interference of goal-violations was observed when subjects attended to the grip of the action. Importantly, observation of irrelevant goal- or grip-related violations interfered with making decisions about the correctness of the relevant dimension only when the relevant dimension was correct. In contrast, in Experiment 2, when subjects attended to an action-irrelevant stimulus dimension (i. e. orientation of the object), no interference of goal- or grip-related violations was found, ruling out the possibility that interference-effects result from perceptual differences between stimuli. These findings suggest that understanding the correctness of an action selectively recruits specialized, but interacting networks, processing the correctness of goal- and grip-specific information during action observation...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeep brain {{stimulation}} (DBS) of the subgenual cingulate gyrus (area CG 25) {{is beneficial}} in treatment resistant depression. Though {{the mechanisms of}} action of Cg 25 DBS remain largely unknown, it is commonly believed that Cg 25 DBS modulates limbic activity of large networks to achieve thymic regulation of patients. To investigate how emotional attention is influenced by Cg 25 DBS, we assessed behavioral and electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to an emotional Stroop task in 5 patients during ON and OFF stimulation conditions. Using EEG source localization, {{we found that the}} main effect of DBS was a reduction of neuronal responses in limbic regions (temporal pole, medial prefrontal and posterior cingulate cortices) and in ventral visual areas involved in face processing. In the dynamic causal modeling (DCM) approach, the changes of the evoked response amplitudes are assumed to be due to changes of long range connectivity induced by Cg 25 DBS. Here, using a simplified neural mass model that did not take explicitly into account the cytoarchitecture of the considered brain regions, we showed that the <b>remote</b> <b>action</b> of Cg 25 DBS could be explained by a reduced top-down effective connectivity of the amygdalo-temporo-polar complex. Overall, our results thus indicate that Cg 25 DBS during the emotional Stroop task causes a decrease of top-down limbic influence on the ventral visual stream itself, rather than a modulation of prefrontal cognitive processes only. Tuning down limbic excitability in relation to sensory processing might be one of the biological mechanisms through which Cg 25 DBS produces positive clinical outcome in the treatment of resistant depression...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe HYDROPTIMET {{case studies}} (9 ? 10 June 2000 Catalogne, 8 ? 9 September 2002 Cévennes and 24 ? 26 November 2002 Piémont) appear to {{encompass}} {{a sort of}} prototype flash-flood situations in the western Mediterranean attending to the relevant synoptic and mesoscale signatures identified on the meteorological charts. In Catalogne, the convective event was driven by a low-pressure system of relatively small dimensions developed over the mediterranean coast of Spain that moved into southern France. For Cévennes, the main circulation pattern was a synoptic-scale Atlantic low which induced a persistent southerly low-level jet (LLJ) over the western Mediterranean, strengthened by the Alps along its western flank, which guaranteed continuous moisture supply towards southern France where the long-lived, quasistationary convective system developed. The long Piémont episode, very representative of the most severe alpine flash flood events, shares some similarities with the Cévennes situation during its first stage {{in that it was}} controlled by a southerly moist LLJ associated with a large-scale disturbance located to the west. However, these circulation features were transient aspects and {{during the second half of}} the episode the situation was dominated by a cyclogenesis process over the Mediterranean which gave place to a mesoscale-size depression at surface that acted to force new heavy rain over the slopes of the Alps and maritime areas. That is, the Piémont episode can be catalogued as of mixed type with regard to the responsible surface disturbance, evolving from a large-scale pattern with <b>remote</b> <b>action</b> (like Cévennes) to a mesoscale pattern with local action (like Catalogne). A prominent mid-tropospheric trough or cut-off low can be identified in all events prior and during the period of heavy rain, which clearly served as the precursor agent for the onset of the flash-flood conditions and the cyclogenesis at low-levels. Being aware of the uncertainty in the representation of the upper-level disturbance and the necessity to cope with it within the operational context when attempting to issue short to mid-range numerical weather predictions of these high impact weather events, a systematic exploration of the predictability of the three selected case studies subject to uncertainties in the representation of the upper-level precursor disturbance is carried out in this paper. The study is based on an ensemble of mesoscale numerical simulations of each event with the MM 5 non-hydrostatic model after perturbing in a systematic way the upper-level disturbance, in the sense of displacing slightly this disturbance upstream/downstream along the zonal direction and intensifying/weakening its amplitude. These perturbations are guided by a previous application of the MM 5 -adjoint model, which consistently shows high sensitivities of the dynamical control of the heavy rain to the flow configuration about the upper-level disturbance on the day before, thus confirming the precursor characteristics of this agent. The perturbations are introduced to the initial conditions by applying a potential vorticity (PV) inversion procedure to the positive PV anomaly associated with the upper-level disturbance, and then using the inverted fields (wind, temperature and geopotential) to modify under a physically consistent balance the model initial fields. The results generally show that the events dominated by mesoscale low-level disturbances (Catalogne and last stage of the Piémont episode) are very sensitive to the initial uncertainties, such that the heavy rain location and magnitude are in some of the experiments strongly changed in response to the "forecast errors" of the cyclone trajectory, intensity, shape and translational speed. In contrast, the other situations (Cévennes and initial stage of the Piémont episode), dominated by a larger scale system wich basically acts to guarantee the establishment and persistence of the southerly LLJ towards the southern France-north Italy orography, exhibit much higher predictability. That is, the slight modifications in the LLJ direction and intensity encompassed by the ensemble of perturbed forecasts are less critical with respect to the heavy precipitation potential and affected area...|$|E
