40|$|In {{recent years}} {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} identify important factors that can explain re-integration to work for workers on long-term sick leave. The results indicate that multiple factors can explain whether or not people return to work. The aim {{of the study was}} to investigate long-term sick workers' experience of professional support for re-integration to work. Participants were drawn from the database of The National Social Insurance Board in Norway. A random sample was selected of persons with mental illness or musculoskeletal disorders (either p- or l-diagnosis/symptoms related to International Classification in Primary Care), who were in receipt of Rehabilitation allowance. The questionnaire was sent to 1 493 persons of whom 740 responded. The most significant finding is that work training/mastering actions were identified by the majority of the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients as being of slight or moderate use. This highlights the importance of work training/mastering actions being relevant in proportion to the specific situation the individual is presently within. Delays in waiting for treatment attributed to approximately half of the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> recipient's problems returning to work. This study also highlights that <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> recipients experience loss of co-ordinated measures from those who are supposed to contribute to simplifying their return to work. 頲 009 IOS Press.

Material and methods: The study includes all those fulfilling the medical criteria for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits</b> or full disability pension in their first assessment at the State Social Security Institute of Iceland between September 1 st 1999 and November 30 th 2003. Results: <b>Rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits</b> were mainly awarded in younger age groups; disability pension in older age groups. Mental and behavioural disorders were the most common medical reasons for granting <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits</b> among both genders, followed by disorders of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue, malignant neoplasms and injuries. Among females disorders of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue were the most common medical reason for granting full disability pension, but this group of disorders was a less common reason for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits.</b> Those who fulfilled the medical criteria for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits</b> due to disorders of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue were markedly older than those who fulfilled the medical criteria for <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits</b> due to mental and behavioural disorders.

OBJECTIVES: To explore {{the benefits of a}} database for routine collection of clinical outcomes within an inpatient neurorehabilitation setting; determine the effectiveness of inpatient neurorehabilitation in a range of neurological conditions; and determine variables influencing change in functional outcome. METHODS: Over a nine year period, demographic and diagnostic characteristics were collected for the 1458 patients admitted consecutively to a neurorehabilitation unit. The level of function was measured on admission and discharge using the Barthel Index (BI) and Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Patient perception of <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> was evaluated using visual analogue scales (VAS). RESULTS: Of the 1413 patients (mean (SD) age 48 (14. 8), range 16 to 87) whose length of stay was more than 10 days (mean 34 (24) range 10 to 184), 282 had stroke, 614 multiple sclerosis, 248 spinal cord injuries, 93 a neuromuscular condition, and 176 other brain pathology. Patients improved in functional ability as measured by both BI and the FIM motor subscale (effect sizes 0. 93 to 1. 44 and 1. 01 to 1. 48, respectively).

Region Vastra Gotaland (VGR) started an NBR to offer additional rehabilitation for its employees on long-term sick leave due to SRMD, where initial care had not been sufficient. The aim was to explore whether the mental health and well-being of NBR participants had improved {{at the end of the}} NBR and at three follow-ups, and to explore the development of sick leave and health care utilization according to the NBR model (n = 57) and an occupational health service (OHS) model (n = 45).

40|$|Personalization of {{treatment}} is a current strategic goal for improving health care. Integrated treatment approaches such as psychiatric <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> from personaliza-tion because they involve matching diverse arrays of treat-ment options to individually unique profiles of need. The need for personalization {{is evident in}} the heterogeneity of people with severe mental illness and in the findings of experimental psychopathology. One pathway to person-alization lies in analysis of the judgments and decision mak-ing of human experts and other participants as they respond to complex circumstances in pursuit {{of treatment}} and reha-bilitation goals. Such analysis is aided by computer simu-lation of human decision making, which in turn informs development of computerized clinical decision support sys-tems. This inspires a research program involving concur-rent development of databases, domain ontology, and problem-solving algorithms, toward the goal of personaliz-ing psychiatric rehabilitation through human collaboration with intelligent cyber systems. The immediate hurdle is to demonstrate that clinical decisions beyond diagnosis really do affect outcome. This can be done by supporting the hy-pothesis that a human treatment team with access to a rea-sonably comprehensive clinical database that tracks patient status and treatment response over time achieves better outcome than a treatment team without such access, in a controlled experimental trial. Provided the hypothesis can be supported, the near future will see prototype systems that can construct an integrated assessment, formulation, and rehabilitation plan from clinical assessment data and contextual information. This will lead to advanced systems that collaborate with human decision makers to personalize psychiatric rehabilitation and optimize outcome.

Few {{studies have examined}} these measures, and the validity {{is yet to be}} established. We aimed to estimate the validity of self-reported disability pension, <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> and retirement pension and to explore the benefit status and basic characteristics of those not responding to these items. A large health survey (HUNT 2) containing self-reported questionnaire data on sickness benefits and pensions was linked to a national registry of pensions and benefits, used as “gold standard” for the analysis. We investigated two main sources of bias in self-reported data; misclassification - due to participants answering questions incorrectly, and systematic missing/selection bias - when participants do not respond to the questions. Sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predicative value, agreement and Cohen’s Kappa were calculated for each benefit.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of drastic labour market changes in the late 1990 s, many employees experienced more stress in the workplace. Prolonged exposure to stress can lead to {{physical and mental health}} problems, and rehabilitation takes a long time. The lack of established rehabilitation programmes for patients with stress-related mental disorders has opened up for the use of garden/nature in a multimodal rehabilitation context (Nature- Based Therapy, NBT). The aim of Study I was to explore how participants in an Nature-Based Rehabilitation (NBR) experienced their rehabilitation. Study II aimed to explore effects on burnout, work ability, stress-related health symptoms, and sick leave from participation in a nature-based stress management course (NBSC) and to investigate how the nature/garden content was experienced. Study III aimed to explore the effects of NBR in individuals with long sick leave due to stress-related mental disorders and to explore the development of sick leave and health care utilization. Study IV aimed to examine potential environmental effects on directed attention and physiological measures of relaxation in nature and indoors. Validated self-assessment instruments, data from regional and national registers and semi-structured interviews were used. Education about nature opened up for new perspectives on life; thus, nature triggered existential reflection, which enhanced the recovery process. Nature and garden were experienced as supportive environments. Results for participants in the NBSC showed decreased burnout-scores and long-term sick leaves, and increased work ability; furthermore less stress-related symptoms were reported. The same pattern was seen for the NBR participants concerning burnout and also for depression, anxiety and wellbeing, reduced health care utilization, and a movement from ordinary sickness benefit to <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefit</b> was seen. Improved directed attention after relaxation in nature was seen. No environmental effects were seen for blood pressure or heart rate. The results indicate that the NBT in this thesis was successful in both prevention and rehabilitation, and in restarting a stalled rehabilitation process. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} demonstrated the efficacy of motor-imagery (MI) for promoting neuro-motor re-learning in post-stroke patients [1 - 2]. When a subject mentally rehearse a movement, the central and peripheral neuro-motor pathways involved in the generation of that movement are reinforced. Anyway, re-learning processes are based on the continuous integration of motor efferences and sensorial afferences. One main limit of MI relies in the absence of sensorial afferences. An idea to increase the <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits</b> of MI could be to use functional electrical stimulation (FES) to provide the sensorial afferences of the imagined movements. The aim of our study was to design a novel rehabilitation method for stroke patients in which MI of the grasping movement is detected by a Brain Computer Interface (BCI) system and used to trigger the electrical stimulation of the muscles involved in the same movement. Pfurtscheller et al developed a system of MI-based BCI in which the MI of the movement of one hand triggered the stimulation of the other during grasping [3].

40|$|BACKGROUND: Following {{acquired}} {{brain injury}} (ABI), deficits in executive functioning (EF) are common. As a result many brain-injured patients encounter problems in every-day functioning, {{and their families}} experience significant strain. Previous research has documented the <b>benefits</b> of cognitive <b>rehabilitation</b> for executive dysfunction, and rehabilitation programmes designed to ameliorate functional problems associated with ABI. OBJECTIVES: This study primarily aims to evaluate whether a neuropsychological rehabilitation programme reduces reported symptoms of everyday dysexecutive behaviour and carer strain. METHODS: In this study 66 ABI outpatients attended comprehensive holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation programme. A repeated-measures design was employed {{to determine the effect}} of rehabilitation on EF and carer strain, as part of a service evaluation. Outcome measures comprised the dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX/DEX-I) and carer strain index (CSI), applied pre- and post-rehabilitation. RESULTS: Results indicate <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefited</b> clients and carers in 5 of 6 DEX/DEX-I subscales, and 2 of 3 CSI subscales, (p<. 05). An effect of aetiology on rehabilitation was found on the metacognitive scale of the DEX-I. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, this study supports a comprehensive holistic neuropsychological rehabilitation programme as effective in reducing reported symptoms of dysexecutive behaviour and carer strain following ABI...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an {{opinion in the}} discussion concerning a draft proposal of the Ministry of Labour and Social Policies concerning the reforms in the social security system. A special {{attention has been given}} to accident and injury at work insurance, injuries and injury benefits as well as pensions for retired workers unable to work after an accident at work. The author postulates restoration of the recourse in relation to the insured enterprises, including private ones. In the context of the existing legislative regulations in Poland, the draft proposal referred to in the paper received a critical review. Although, generally speaking, the proposed division of the social fund into three separate funds (pension fund, sickness/disability fund and accident fund), is justified, in the opinion of the author of the paper two of those funds and benefits from those funds will overlap. Both the sickness/disability fund and the accident fund will be used to source eg. benefits for the disabled and <b>rehabilitation</b> <b>benefits.</b> Therefore such a division will not be cost-effective.
