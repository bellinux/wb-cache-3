50|$|The joint US/Canadian ADIZ, {{which is}} almost {{exclusively}} over water, serves as a national defense boundary for aerial incursions. Any aircraft that wishes to fly in or through the boundary must file either a Defense Visual Flight Rules (DVFR) flight plan or an Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) flight plan before crossing the ADIZ. The aircraft must have an operational <b>radar</b> <b>transponder</b> and maintain two-way radio contact while approaching and crossing the North American ADIZ.|$|E
50|$|All {{vehicles}} were fitted with an inter-vehicle link network to transmit data and orders by cable and for radio communication by a VHF radio link. The radar could track one target and guide {{one or two}} missiles simultaneously. The missiles, fired 2.5 seconds apart, were acquired immediately after launch by the 1.1° tracking beam of the radar {{with the help of}} infrared detection and <b>radar</b> <b>transponders</b> during the gathering phase.

50|$|The {{microwave}} auditory effect, {{also known}} as the microwave hearing effect or the Frey effect, consists of audible clicks (or, with speech modulation, spoken words) induced by pulsed/modulated microwave frequencies. The clicks are generated directly inside the human head without the need of any receiving electronic device. The effect was first reported by persons working in the vicinity of <b>radar</b> <b>transponders</b> during World War II. During the Cold War era, the American neuroscientist Allan H. Frey studied this phenomenon and was the first to publish information {{on the nature of the}} microwave auditory effect.|$|R
50|$|The 250 kg {{bare and}} 750 kg loaded rowboat was {{equipped}} with many advanced navigational, safety and communications systems {{as well as a}} pair of 12 volt gel batteries charged by a solar panel that powered them all.

50|$|The C-Band <b>Radar</b> <b>Transponder</b> (Model SST-135C) is {{intended}} to increase the range and accuracy of the radar ground stations equipped with AN/FPS-16, and AN/FPQ-6 Radar Systems. C-band radar stations at the Kennedy Space Center, along the Atlantic Missile Range, and at many other locations around the world, provide global tracking capabilities. Beginning with Vehicles 204 and 501, two C-band radar transponders will be carried in the instrumentation unit (IU) to provide radar tracking capabilities independent of the vehicle attitude. This arrangement is more reliable than the antenna switching circuits necessary if only one transponder would be used.|$|E
50|$|Lead-acid {{batteries}} {{were used}} as weight {{was not an issue}} on first launch, and proven robustness were deemed more important the low weight of LiPo. Four 12V 7Ah batteries were divided into two banks; two in parallel supplying 12V circuits redundantly, and two in series for the 24V Weibel <b>radar</b> <b>transponder</b> sending to a Continuous Wave radar on the deck of Hjortø. The combination of transmitter and radar meant that several objects could be tracked in motion as well as being stationary. The budget did not allow for an inertial measurement unit to compensate for ship movement, but an infrared camera on the radar allowed operators to track the rocket.|$|E
40|$|Deformation {{estimates}} from Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) are relative: {{they form a}} ‘free’ network referred to an arbitrary datum, e. g. by assuming a reference point in the image to be stable. However, some applications require ‘absolute’ InSAR estimates, i. e. expressed in a well-defined terrestrial reference frame, e. g. to compare InSAR results {{with those of other}} techniques. We propose a methodology based on collocated InSAR and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements, achieved by rigidly attaching phase-stable millimetre-precision compact active <b>radar</b> <b>transponders</b> to GNSS antennas. We demonstrate this concept through a simulated example and practical case studies in the Netherland...|$|R

The aircraft must {{be equipped with}} a two-way radio and an operating Mode C (altitude reporting) <b>radar</b> <b>transponder,</b> furthermore aircraft overflying above the upper limit of class C airspace upward to 10,000 feet MSL must have an operating Mode C transponder. VFR flights in class C airspace must have three miles (5 km) of visibility, and fly an altitude at least 500 ft below, 1000 ft above, and 2000 ft laterally from clouds.|$|E
5000|$|The {{test vehicle}} was a 3/10-scale {{model of the}} Miles E.24/43 design except for the {{omission}} of the distinctive annular air intake of the full-scale aircraft. To maintain {{the center of gravity}} (c.g.) it was necessary to include a large balance weight (a!most 1/10 of total all-up weight) in the foremost section of the nose. The layout was further restricted by the need to maintain a constant c.g. position during the consumption of the fuels. This was achieved by placing a small tank ahead of the wing holding one third of the total oxidant (as well as the fuel in the shaped nose tank) and locating the main oxidant tank aft of tile wing. Other large components were placed fore and aft of the wing. In the space below and above the wing centre section were located the air, fuel, oxidant and warm-air pipes, telemetering transmitter, instruments and batteries as well as the autopilot, timing clock, wiring terminal fuses and the connections by which the test vehicle was carried on the parent aircraft. The rear section housed the combustion chamber, <b>radar</b> <b>transponder,</b> smoke-producing fluid, instruments and oscillators for combustion chamber pressure and tailplane angle, servos and dive mechanism for the tailplane which together with the fixed directional fin were fitted to the lower body prior. The single-piece wing was of mahogany with Dural inserts at the leading and trailing edges; it was of biconvex section and of tapered planform with an unswept half-chord line. The Dural inserts formed a convenient dipole-aerial system for the telemetering unit. (A similar arrangement on the tailplane served the <b>radar</b> <b>transponder.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{surveillance}} radar (SSR) is a radar system used in {{air traffic control}} (ATC), that not only detects and measures the position of aircraft i.e. bearing, but also requests additional information from the aircraft itself such as its identity and altitude. Unlike primary radar systems that measure the bearing of targets using the detected reflections of radio signals, SSR relies on targets equipped with a <b>radar</b> <b>transponder,</b> that replies to each interrogation signal by transmitting a response containing encoded data. SSR {{is based on the}} military identification friend or foe (IFF) technology originally developed during World War II, therefore the two systems are still compatible. Monopulse secondary {{surveillance radar}} (MSSR), Mode S, TCAS and ADS-B are similar modern methods of secondary surveillance.|$|E
