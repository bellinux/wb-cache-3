5|$|Originally, Betelgeuse {{was to call}} at Sines, Portugal, {{to lighten}} the load of the ship, but poor weather {{conditions}} prevented the vessel from entering the harbour. Plans were further frustrated at Leixões, where a ship had <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> across the harbour entrance, preventing Betelgeuse from berthing there to discharge her cargo. Betelgeuse was then instructed to sail for Whiddy Island, Ireland.|$|E
5|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914, Marceau was converted into a floating workshop to support torpedo boats and submarines. She was initially based in Malta, but was later moved to Corfu and then to Bizerte in 1918. She was stricken from the naval register on 1 October 1920, and sold to a shipbreaking firm based in Toulon in 1921. While she was being towed to Toulon, a storm caused her to <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> off Bizerte. She remained visible there until the 1930s.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1930s Frunze {{was used as}} a barracks hulk while she was {{stripped}} for parts, until she was formally discarded 1 December 1940, after scrapping had already begun at a leisurely pace. After the German invasion she was towed to Kronstadt and <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> in late July 1941 near the Leningrad Sea Canal. During the Siege of Leningrad her hull {{was used as a}} base for small ships. Frunze raised on 31 May 1944, towed to Leningrad and scrapped beginning in 1949.|$|E
50|$|In 1910 she <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on shingle at Parkswood, Waterford River {{during a}} fog. She <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> {{again in the}} same river in 1929.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was named}} for the ferry [...] which <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on the then-uncharted rock in 1983. The ferry Nisqually <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on the same rock in 1994.|$|R
50|$|On February 18, 1942, {{more than}} 200 American sailors died when the USS Truxton <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> near Chambers Cove and the USS Pollux <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> at Lawn Point.|$|R
5|$|El Oriente resumed cargo {{service with}} the Morgan Line, and enjoyed a quiet career, {{typically}} sailing between New York and Galveston. One event of note occurred in February 1922 when El Oriente {{came upon the}} wreck of the schooner, Caldwell H. Colt, which had <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> on a reef near the Tortugas Light during a gale. When El Oriente came upon the hulk, only her captain remained alive, surviving without food or water for several days before his rescue. El Oriente continued on to Galveston and landed the man there.|$|E
5|$|The garrison's defences were {{supported}} with artillery fire from a Royalist warship that was deliberately <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> {{north of the}} castle to produce an additional gun platform. By July, food had begun to run short {{and some of the}} garrison unsuccessfully attempted to break out by sea to acquire supplies. Arundell agreed to an honourable surrender on 15 August, and around 900 survivors left the fort two days later, some terminally ill from malnutrition. Pendennis was the penultimate Royalist fortification to hold out in the war.|$|E
5|$|Arnold {{then led}} {{many of the}} {{remaining}} smaller craft into a small bay on the Vermont shore now named Arnold's Bay 2 miles south of Buttonmold Bay, where the waters were too shallow for the larger British vessels to follow. These boats were then <b>run</b> <b>aground,</b> stripped, and set on fire, with their flags still flying. Arnold, the last to land, personally torched his flagship Congress. The surviving ships' crews, numbering about 200, then made their way overland to Crown Point, narrowly escaping an Indian ambush. There they found Trumbull, New York, Enterprise, and Revenge, all of which had escaped the British fleet, as well as Liberty, which had just arrived with supplies from Ticonderoga.|$|E
50|$|On November 30, 1896 the {{schooner}} Bertha Warner <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> and {{the station}} saved {{all but one}} man. The crew of the station consisted of Elwood Rogers, Pete Newman, Joe Smyers, Jim Applegate, George Everingham and others. In 1906 the SS Carenz <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> and 38 people were rescued. In 1909 the SS Thurmond <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> and Henry Ware led the rescue.|$|R
50|$|On May 9, 1825 the {{schooner}} <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> near Cedar Point, Ohio on Lake Erie. Three years later, on January 29, 1828, {{it again}} <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> {{on the lake}} near Buffalo.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Discovery <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> {{in early}} August 1792 on hidden rocks in Queen Charlotte Strait near Fife Sound. Within a day Chatham also <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on rocks {{about two miles}} away.|$|R
5|$|Because Missouri had <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> {{during an}} unusually high tide, Wallin {{required}} a date on which the tide would be roughly comparable to {{the conditions under which}} Missouri was grounded in order to free her. The date selected was 2 February. With time as a factor, Wallin took charge of the operation and put his five-point plan into motion. With the assistance of Admiral Smith, Wallin was able to assemble a large salvage force which included submarine rescue ships, special salvage ships, divers, and pontoons to add additional buoyancy for the tug boats when the time came to move Missouri.|$|E
5|$|Cornwall, {{named to}} commemorate the English county, was laid down at Pembroke Royal Dockyard, Wales, on 11 March 1901, and {{launched}} on 29 October 1902. She was completed on 1 December 1904 and was initially assigned to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron of the Channel Fleet. In December 1906 the ship began a refit that lasted through 1907. She became a cadet training ship in January 1908 and {{was assigned to the}} 4th Cruiser Squadron on the North America and West Indies Station. On 6 August 1911 Cornwall ran aground on Pinnacle Rock, off Cape Sable Island in Nova Scotia while assisting the protected cruiser , which had also <b>run</b> <b>aground.</b> Both cruisers were refloated and Cornwall was repaired at His Majesty's Canadian Dockyard, Halifax.|$|E
5|$|Emden {{departed}} Pillau on 1 February, {{bound for}} Kiel. She arrived on 7 February 1945 {{and was taken}} into the Deutsche Werke dockyard to complete the necessary repairs. British bombers attacked the ship twice and damaged her badly. The ship was listing heavily, and so on 14 April, she was towed out into Heikendorfer Bay and <b>run</b> <b>aground.</b> The Germans then blew her up on 3 May to prevent the Allies from capturing the ship. The wreck was ultimately broken up for scrap in 1949. Her bow ornament is currently {{on display in the}} Deutsches Museum in Munich.|$|E
5000|$|In 1865, the 38-ton {{schooner}} Eugenie wrecked on Peche Island. The steamship Oneida <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> {{there in}} July 1871. On July 8, 1998, the Tadoussac [...] <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> 2 mi east of Peche Island.|$|R
40|$|The {{vessel was}} built at Port Arthur, Ontario in 1952 by the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Company for the Canada Steamship Linens of Montreal, Quebec. She <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> near the Thousands Islands Bridge, St. Lawrence Rive, 1972. In 1980, she <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> {{a second time}} near Champlain, Quebec [...] Four tugs {{released}} her. The following year, she <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> a third time while downbound in the St. Mary's river below the locks...|$|R
5000|$|On December 10, 1910, Olympia <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on Bligh Reef off Alaska′s Prince William Sound {{and sank}} without loss of life. Following the sinking, {{steamboat}} inspectors accused Captain Daniels, {{in command of}} Olympia when she <b>ran</b> <b>aground,</b> of [...] "unskillful navigation." ...|$|R
5|$|Iron Duke {{remained}} {{on active duty}} {{for only a few}} more years; in 1930, the London Naval Treaty specified that the four Iron Duke-class battleships be scrapped or otherwise demilitarised. Iron Duke was therefore converted into a gunnery training ship; her armour and much of her armament was removed to render her unfit for combat. She served in this capacity until the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, when she was moored in Scapa Flow as a harbour defence ship. In October, she was badly damaged by German bombers and was <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> to avoid sinking. She continued to serve as an anti-aircraft platform {{for the duration of the}} war, and was eventually refloated and broken up for scrap in the late 1940s.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Monitor withdrew, Virginia had <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> {{at which}} time Commander Jones {{came down from the}} spar deck only to find the gun crews not {{returning}} fire. Jones demanded to know why and was briefed by Lieutenant Eggleston that powder was low and precious and given Monitors resistance to shot after two hours of battle, maintained that continued firing at that point would only be a waste of ammunition. Virginia soon managed to break away and headed back towards Norfolk, believing that Monitor had withdrawn from battle. Greene, now in command, did not pursue Virginia and, like Worden, was under orders to stay with and protect Minnesota, an action for which he was later criticized.|$|E
5|$|When {{launched}} in 1843, Great Britain {{was by far}} the largest vessel afloat. However, her protracted construction and high cost had left her owners in a difficult financial position, and they were forced out of business in 1846 having spent all their funds re-floating the ship after she was <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> at Dundrum Bay after a navigational error. In 1852 she was sold for salvage and repaired. Great Britain carried thousands of immigrants to Australia from 1852 until converted to sail in 1881. Three years later, she was retired to the Falkland Islands where she was used as a warehouse, quarantine ship and coal hulk until scuttled in 1937.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Kommandøren was modernized at Stavanger Støberi & Dok in Stavanger, {{gaining a}} new boiler for the steam engine and being painted white. In January the next year, she <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> at Rongevær in the Fensfjord. She <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> again in 1913, in Herdlefjorden.|$|R
5000|$|Didon <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on {{the south}} coast of Saint Croix on 25 May 1836 and lost her rudder. Although refloated, she <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> a second time before being taken in to Frederickstadt. [...] She later {{took part in the}} Crimean War as a troopship.|$|R
5000|$|Deployed to WestPac in 1958, Prestige <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> in Naruto Strait, Inland Sea, Japan, 23 August 1958. [...] {{came to her}} rescue, but <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> herself. Pivot {{managed to}} free herself, but Prestige could not break free and was {{abandoned}} and declared a total loss.|$|R
5|$|After her commissioning, she was {{assigned}} {{to serve as a}} flotilla leader for torpedo boats. She participated in only one major action, Operation Albion, in October 1917. There, she shelled Russian gun batteries and troop positions and engaged Russian destroyers and gunboats. The ship also led a successful, albeit minor, operation against British shipping in the North Sea in December 1917. After the end of the war, she was interned {{with the rest of the}} German fleet in Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, the interned fleet scuttled itself, though Emden was <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> by British ships before she could sink completely. Ceded to France in the Treaty of Versailles, she was too badly damaged by the attempted scuttling and beaching to see service with the French Navy, so was instead used as a target after 1922, and broken up for scrap in 1926.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{not officially}} listed in HURDAT, Hurricane Amanda, named after a ship <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> by the storm, {{developed}} in the Gulf of Mexico on May24. First documented in 2013 by Michael Chenoweth and Cary Mock, the system capsized several other ships and caused damage {{along the coast of}} the Florida Panhandle. The cyclone made landfall near Apalachicola, Florida exceptionally early in the season, on May 28. Amanda holds the distinction of being the only known hurricane landfall in the United States in the month of May since HURDAT records began in 1851. On land and at sea, the cyclone left at least 110fatalities. Few other storms were notable. In August, the third official storm capsized the American brig Bainbridge off Hatteras, North Carolina, drowning 80people. The seventh official cyclone caused 10deaths near Tampico, Tamaulipas, after the ship J.K.L. sunk. It's the strongest earliest hurricane.|$|E
5|$|As the British destroyers {{completed}} their second attack, {{they were engaged}} by three more German destroyers. The British destroyers attempted to withdraw to the west, but were pursued by the German ships. Two additional German destroyers crossed the T of the British ships and quickly knocked out Hardys forward guns. More hits to the ship's bridge and superstructure set her on fire, mortally wounded Captain Warburton-Lee and killed or wounded {{all of the other}} officers on the bridge except Paymaster Lieutenant G.H. Stanning, the Captain's Secretary. Although badly wounded, he took command and after several more hits disabled her boilers ordered her <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> at Vidrek. The First Lieutenant, who had not been present on the bridge, assumed command and ordered the ship abandoned. Some of the crew delayed doing so until the last torpedo was fruitlessly fired at a German ship and No. 4 gun fired until it was out of ammunition.|$|E
50|$|Kianga was {{launched}} by R. J. Lacey at Narooma for Sawmillers Shipping Company in 1922. She <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> on the Narooma bar on 5 January 1924 and was repaired at Morts Dock. She later <b>ran</b> <b>aground</b> at Binge Binge Point near Moruya on 19 June 1931.|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1919, Cambrian was refitted in Rosyth before she sailed for Devonport where she was visited by the Edward, Prince of Wales on 13 June. The ship {{was assigned to the}} North American and West Indies Station the following month, where she served until 1922. Cambrians crew spent several days in August trying to tow off the schooner Bella Scott after she had <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> near Kingston, Jamaica and received a brief refit in Bermuda in March–April 1920. The Prince of Wales again visited the ship on 26 September in Dominica. On 25 January 1921, she was inspected by Vice-Admiral Sir William Pakenham at Bermuda and again on 17 June. The ship arrived at Plymouth, Massachusetts to participate in the Pilgrim Tercentenary celebrations on 31 July.|$|E
5|$|Boston's British {{military}} leaders, General Thomas Gage and Admiral Samuel Graves, {{both had}} reason {{to do business with}} the people of Machias. Gage required lumber to build barracks for the additional troops arriving in the besieged city. Graves wanted to recover the guns from the HMS Halifax shipwreck, which been intentionally <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> in Machias Bay by a local pilot in February 1775. The ship's guns were reported to be of interest to the Patriots of Machias. Graves authorized Ichabod Jones, a Tory Machias merchant, to take flour and other food supplies aboard his ships Unity and Polly to exchange for Gage's needed lumber. To guarantee that this trade would happen, Graves sent James Moore, a midshipman from his flagship HMS Preston, to command the armed schooner Margaretta and accompany the two merchant vessels. Moore had additional orders to retrieve what he could from the wreck site of the HMS Halifax.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs {{to the site}} of the grounding with the hope that they would be able to free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had <b>run</b> <b>aground</b> during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
