5000|$|While {{structural}} {{blind rivets}} using a locked mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] blind rivets where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a <b>round</b> <b>head</b> <b>rivet,</b> taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|E
40|$|TAP/NDE (Thermo-Acousto-Photonic {{nondestructive}} evaluation) {{has been}} developed {{to the point where}} it is possible to confidently explore many different application areas. One area of interest is the inspection of defects around rivet holes and under rivet heads. This problem is of concern not only from a safety point of view in aging aircraft, but also has major economic implications. For example, a heavy “C” check for a Boeing 707 requires the physical removal, inspection and replacement of many thousands of structural fasteners. Of the various types of rivets the <b>round</b> <b>head</b> <b>rivet</b> hole was chosen for this preliminary analysis (Fig. 1). Since it is not known how Lamb waves interact with an in situ rivet, we have chosen to restrict this analysis to the simplest possible case where there is no rivet in the hole. This corresponds to the current practice of removing the rivet and then using eddy current probes to inspect the hole. Our goal is to develop an inspection technique that does not require the physical removal of the rivet. The buried in-plane defect study was undertaken to provide real time, on-line detection of flaws during the processing of the material to prevent these flaws from causing in-service, premature rivet hole degradation. This inspection would prevent flawed materials from entering service...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this paper}} is to assess the impact of the rivet hole sizing process on the fatigue life based on the example of the {{structural}} connections characteristic for riveted joints used in aviation industry. Test specimens reflected the structural connection consisting in a riveted lap joint of an airplane plating stiffened with a T-bar. Connected plates and the T-bar are made of D 16 CzATW aluminum alloy. 3 mm diameter <b>round</b> <b>head</b> solid <b>rivets</b> for aviation-related purposes were made of PA 24 aluminum. During fatigue tests, individual specimens with non-sized holes and with sized holes were subjected to uniaxial, one-sided, fixed-amplitude loading (R = 0). It can be concluded from the fatigue life comparison that introduction of an additional operation in the riveting process, i. e. the hole sizing, results in significant, about two-fold increase of the fatigue life of the riveted structural connection, even at slight sizing degree. The difference of the specimen damage nature was observed between specimens with sized and non-sized holes...|$|R
40|$|In {{order that}} the results of these tests might be of the most {{practical}} value, the test specimens were made at the Douglas Company with the same material and methods used in present metal construction. The material used was 24 srt sheet with l 7 st rivets except in a few specimens that will be mentioned later. The first two test series were designed to determine the optimum edge distance and pitch in terms of the rivet diameter for a single riveted lap joint. The third test series was used to determine the ultimate bearing strength of 24 srt sheet for various sheet thickness. Tests were made for both lap and butt joints. The lap joint was tested for the following type <b>rivets.</b> 1. <b>Round</b> <b>head</b> <b>rivets.</b> 2. Countersunk rivets. 3. 3 's <b>rivets</b> with welded <b>heads.</b> Tests were also made showing the variation of bearing strength of the sheet in a lap joint with the <b>head</b> of the <b>rivet.</b> Test series No. 4 was devoted to the shear of rivets. An attempt was made to classify the following riveting methods by the shearing value of the driver rivet. 1. Hand Riveting. 2. Vibrators (Air Hammer). 3. Pneumatic Squeezers. 4. Spinners. 5. One shot Gun. 6. Automatic Riveter (Eccentric Press) These tests were made using a lap joint and covered the range of rivets from 3 / 32 " to 1 / 4 " in diameter. Shearing tests were also made using countersunk rivets and 3 s <b>rivets</b> with welded <b>heads.</b> Various diameter of 17 st rivets were tested in double shear and a test was made showing the variation of shearing value versus sheet thickness for both single and double shear. Also the effect of friction upon the ultimate shearing value of rivets was determined. Test series No. 5 was used to determine the shearing value of malleability of 17 st rivets for various times of ageing. Test series No. 6 gives the ultimate tensile strength of 24 srt sheet for various thickness of sheet from. 020 to. 128 ". Test series No. 7 [...] Because of some question as to the load taken by rivets when placed in line a series of specimens were made up with the number of rivets in a line varying from 1 to 12. The specimens were tested for ultimate load...|$|R
5000|$|At {{a central}} {{location}} near the areas being riveted, a furnace was set up. Rivets {{were placed in}} the furnace and heated to glowing hot (often to white hot) so that they were more plastic and easily deformed. The rivet warmer or [...] "cook" [...] used tongs to remove individual rivets and throw them to a catcher stationed near the joints to be riveted. The catcher (usually) caught the rivet in a leather or wooden bucket with an ash-lined bottom. He placed the rivet into the hole to be riveted, then quickly turned to catch the next rivet. The [...] "holder up or holder on" [...] would hold a heavy rivet set or dolly or another (larger) pneumatic jack against the <b>round</b> <b>head</b> of the <b>rivet,</b> while the riveter (sometimes two riveters) applied a hammer or pneumatic rivet hammer to the unformed head, making it mushroom tightly against the joint in its final domed shape. Alternatively the buck is hammered more or less flush with the structure in a counter sunk hole. Before the use of pneumatic hammers, e.g. in the construction of RMS Titanic, the man who hammered the rivet was known as the [...] "basher". Upon cooling, the rivet contracted and exerted further force, tightening the joint.|$|R

40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> or one with perfectly flush countersunk rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval countersunk heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The order of merit in regard to low resistance is flush countersunk, oval countersunk (whether sunk below the surface or not), brazier, and round...|$|R
