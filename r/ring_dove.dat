40|$|Changes in {{follicular}} size (in diameter) {{were studied}} by laparotomy under various photoperiodic {{regimes in the}} domesticated <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> that have been kept under standard laboratory conditions for generations. Follicular response shows two distinct patterns: 1. a shift from standard laboratory photoperiodic regime (LD 14 : 10) to extra long day (LD 20 : 4) accelerated the follicular development in the spring {{as well as in}} the autumn; 2. a shift from the standard laboratory photoperiodic regime (LD 14 : 10) to short day (LD 8 : 16 or LD 1 / 2 : 23 1 / 2) induced follicular regressions in the autumn but not in the spring. We propose that there is a responsive phase (spring) and nonresponsive phase (autumn) of hypothalamo-hypophyseal-ovarian system in the <b>ring</b> <b>doves.</b> Comparison of radioimmunoassay of pituitary and plasma LH value suggests that the responsive and non-responsive phase involves mainly release mechanisms.

40|$|The perch-call of <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> (Streptopelia risoria) {{is related}} to {{territorial}} defence and mate attraction. Perch-calls are sexually dimorphic and individually different in structure. The expression of perch-call is androgen-dependent and {{is controlled by the}} action of testosterone on the preoptic- hypothalamic areas. However, it is not known whether the acoustic features of the call vary with the reproductive condition. We studied plasma androgen levels, brain steroid metabolism, and perch-calling of male <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> kept in winter-like (low temperature, short days) or spring-like (mild temperature, long day) conditions. Circulating levels of androgen were higher in males kept on spring-like condition. Spring males spent more time in perch-calling than winter males. However, a detailed analysis of the call structure revealed no difference for any time or frequency parameter between groups. This work shows that in <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> season- dependent variations in the circulating levels of androgen are correlated with differences in the amount of time males spend in perch-calling. In addition, the study suggests that in adult males the acoustic structure of the perch-calls is not influenced by season-related changes in androgen levels. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

After a deprivation of 17 h from the squabs, exposure to a 3 -day-old squab for 1 h resulted in a significant decrease in the prolactin content of the pituitary gland as compared with levels obtained in control birds deprived of their young for 18 h. No significant sex differences in prolactin levels were observed in either group. Because exposure to the young also promotes prolactin-induced crop sac growth, it appears probable that the squab-induced decrease in prolactin content of the pituitary gland reflects the release of prolactin into the circulation.

50|$|Interestingly, {{research}} on avian paternal behavior shows that nest-building is triggered by different stimuli {{in the two}} sexes.

40|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia risoria) is a usefUl {{animal model}} for the {{identification}} of neural and hormonal determinants of reproductive behaviours. Studies were undertaken to investigate the role of dopamine and progesterone in the expression of sexually differentiated patterns of behaviours during the breeding cycle, and provide the first mapping of tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive (Til-ir) structures in the <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> brain. Quantitative analysis revealed increased TFJ-ir cells, in male and female brooding doves, in the nuclei periventricularis magnocellularis, dorsomedialis anterior thalami, pretectalis medialis; and in the nucleus dorsomedialis posterior thalami in female brooding birds. This confirms that increases in dopamine activity during the brooding period are exhibited in regions integrating neuroendocrine and sensory information to mediate the expression of parental defence behaviours. Immunofluorescence studies revealed no co-localisation of progesterone receptor (PR-fr) in TM-fr cells, but demonstrated the presence of TH-fr terminals in axosomatic contact with PR-fr-containing cells in the preoptic region, which may enable dopamine activation of the progesterone receptor, via the Dl receptor. A collaborative study with the University of Hiroshima, demonstrated increased progesterone concentrations in the diencephalon of male brooding doves compared with non-breeding male doves. Measurement of 3 [3 -HSD enzymatic activity confirmed the synthesis of progesterone in the <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> diencephalon.

Primary glial cell culture techniques established the presence of PR-fr in cultured <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> brain cells.

40|$|The <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia risoria) {{expresses a}} stereotyped {{breeding}} cycle {{and has been}} used extensively as a laboratory animal model for studies of avian parental behaviour. Studies were undertaken to identify brain regions of the <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> involved in the exprcssion of these behaviours, and to determine the central nervous function of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin and the neuropeptide VIP in incubation behaviour. Quantitative 2 -deoxyglucose (2 DG) autoradiography {{at the onset of}} incubation revealed an increase in uptake in the nucleus preopticus medialis (POM), nucleus tuberis (NT) and nucleus ovoidalis (Ov). Quantitative 2 DG autoradiography at late incubation and following treatment with exogenous prolactin revealed a generalised increase in 2 D 0 uptake in all areas of the brain studied. This effect may be explained by the proliferation of glial cells in response to an increase in the metabolic requirements of neurones involved in the co-ordination and execution of behaviours associated with the breeding cycle. A quantitative analysis of prolactin binding sites at late incubation demonstrated an increase in binding in the NT and a decrease in binding in the nucleus preopticus anterior (POA). Increases in prolactin binding in the NT may control prolactin secretion by the anterior pituitary and may be influenced by the down-regulation of binding sites in the POA. Intracerebroventricular treatment with VIP antiserum following nest deprivation failed to inhibit the resumption of incubatory behaviour after nest replacement, but was found to decrease food consumption. A study of the neuronal bonnections of the POA and NT revealed connections between these two nuclei and visual and auditory relay areas of the brain. These studies demonstrate that the POA and NT are involved in the onset and continuation of incubation behaviour in the <b>ring</b> <b>dove,</b> and that VIP is not the centrally acting factor responsible for the expression of this behaviour...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to investigate the}} intricate relations between prelaying nest-building activity and preovulatory hormonal changes, {{and the effects of}} these events on breeding success. Pairs of <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> were allowed to go through a complete breeding cycle under four conditions of nest-building opportunity. Nest were self-made, pre-made, pre-made and covered, or removed daily to generate various levels of building activity. Behavioral and hormonal changes were observed throughout the cycle. Blood levels of gonadotrophins were monitored by daily measurements with the method or radioimmunoassay. A depression of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) typically was associated with every preovulatory surge of luteinizing hormone (LH); an LH surge not accompanied by a FSH dip was not followed by ovulation. Moreover, the FSH depression was significantly correlated with the level of nest-building activity. These findings led to the proposal that nest-building activity stimulated preovulatory FSH change and, hence, ovulation. The constructed nest in turn appeared to promote incubation behavior. These results are discussed in the context of breeding success. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|A {{wealth of}} {{physiological}} and pathophysiological roles have been ascribed to nitric oxide (NO) in the nervous system. Many of these seem diverse and unrelated. However, the widespread role NO {{has to play}} in modulation {{of the nervous system}} suggests an underlying common and fundamental role. The ongoing popularity of NO research has lead to a mass of literature on the subject yet great controversy still prevails as to the true physiological function of NO in the nervous system. In this thesis, the existing literature has been critically evaluated. Histological, autoradiographic and electrophysiological research approaches have been used to investigate further the physiological role for NO in the nervous system in the hope of explaining some of the controversy that still prevails. Due to an unforseen move, two different models have been used during the investigations, the brain and the pituitary gland of the <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia risoria) and the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) of the rat. The histological NADPH-diaphorase (NDP) technique was used to show the distribution of the NO synthesising enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) {{for the first time in}} the <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> brain. Previously, the NDP distribution has been mapped in the brain of other species and found to be distinct from all other known neurotransmitters. NADPH-diaphorase is a known marker of the mammalian pontine cholinergic reticular formation. However, findings presented here strongly suggest that the distribution of NOS is far more widespread in structures comprising the avian reticular formation. The distribution of the NO synthesising enzyme and the freely diffusible property of NO make it a highly attractive messenger molecule that might coordinate the spatially distinct structures of the reticular formation enabling them to act as one functional unit. Nitric oxide is released following NMDA receptor activation. Both the presence and the distribution of this component of the NO-cGMP pathway have been shown here for the first time in the <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> brain. This has been achieved using receptor autoradiography of the [3 H]-MK- 801, a ligand that binds to the NMDA receptor channel. The <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> is a popular model for the study of behaviour changes and the hormonal control of the avian breeding cycle. Here, a study was set up to compare regional [3 H]-MK- 801 ligand binding in the brains of non breeding birds (naive) and first time breeders. Quantitative receptor autoradiographic analysis of the ligand binding has shown that significant regional binding changes occur during the breeding cycle of the <b>ring</b> <b>dove.</b> This result implies that the NO-cGMP pathway might have a physiological role in the breeding cycle of the dove and that further investigation of this matter would be worth undertaking. Here, histological and electrophysiological approaches using the rat SCG model have been employed to investigate the role of NO-cGMP pathway in modulation of synaptic transmission. Histological mapping of the pathway components has reconfirmed that NOS is present in the presynaptic fibres and terminals, but it also suggests that it is restricted to a subpopulation of the principal neurones in the ganglion. Immunocytochemistry of the NO-donor induced cGMP accumulations shows that the satellite cells surrounding the principal neurones are major target sites for NO. This finding is consistent with that seen in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and supports a glial target for NO in this tissue. Although, NO-donors depolarise the ganglion and enhance synaptic transmission when extracellularly recording the compound action potential (CAP), intracellular recording did not reveal such clear responses. This difference was attributed to the fact that a subpopulation of the principal neurones receives a NO input. These findings suggest that the SCG is not a particularly efficient model for intracellular investigation of the NO­cGMP pathway. Both intracellular and extracellular investigations into involvement of NO-cGMP pathway in ganglionic L TP suggest that it does not have a role to play in long-term potentiation (L TP) of synaptic efficacy in this tissue. Here, intracellular and extracellular approaches agreed. Further to this, extracellular recording ofLTP of the CAP supported the involvement of the pathway in a short term enhanced synaptic efficacy by a mechanism distinct from L TP. Moreover, it has been shown here that L TP of the epsp can be reliably produced in the SCG. It is therefore suggested that the SCG is a suitable preparation for both intracellular and extracellular investigation of LTP at the peripheral synapse...|$|E
40|$|Female ring doves secrete gonadotrophic hormone in {{response}} to court-ship behaviour of the male. This investigation was concerned with the quantitative relationship between the courtship stimulation presented to females and the responses of their reproductive systems. In a first experi-ment the degree of female reproductive tract development {{was found to be}} correlated with the length of time of daily exposure to a courting male. In a second experiment exposure time was held constant and the amount of courtship presented to females was varied by using different programmes of stimulation by males. Here too, the degree of female reproductive tract development was correlated with the amount of daily courtship behaviour presented. It therefore appears that in the female <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> secretion of gonadotrophin is graded in accordance with the amount of courtship be-haviour perceived by her...|$|E
40|$|The {{courtship}} {{behavior of}} the male <b>ring</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia risoria) combines aggressive displays (chasing, bowing) and nest-oriented displays (nest soliciting). Aggressive displays depend on circulating testosterone, whereas nest soliciting is estrogen-dependent and appears {{to depend on the}} aromatization of androgen into estrogen within the brain. The present work tested the hypothesis that aromatase specifically modulates the nest soliciting display in intact male ring doves. Males were tested for courtship behavior with receptive females before and after being implanted with micro-osmotic pumps containing Fadrozole, a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor, or saline. Fadrozole at the higher dose reduced estrogen-dependent nest soliciting but did not affect androgen-dependent chasing and bowing. These results support the hypothesis that aromatase modulates nest soliciting in male ring doves, and provide further evidence for separate hormonal control of different courtship displays in this species.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{the effect of}} oral melatonin (23 lg/ 0. 1 ml/animal/d; 1 h before dark on 12 consecutive days) in old birds, in natural photoperiods, on the hormone’s plasma levels, and phagocytosis. Blood collections were performed daily at 2 : 00 AM and 4 : 00 PM until 5 days after the treatment. From day 1, the melatonin levels {{were significantly higher than}} basal levels at both times. Values at 2 : 00 AM were significantly higher than the 4 : 00 PM values. After treatment, the melatonin levels declined, returning from day 14 to basal values at both hours. At 2 : 00 AM, phagocytosis was significantly greater than that obtained at 4 : 00 PM and greater than basal values. The 4 : 00 PM values were only significantly greater than basal on days 6 and 8, parallel to a decline in superoxide anion levels, which were lowest at 2 : 00 AM. Melatonin administered to old <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> increases the differences between nocturnal and diurnal plasma levels, and, in parallel, increases phagocytosis and reduces superoxide radical levels in heterophils. DURING the last three decades, in vivo and in vitro datahave confirmed the relationship between the pineal gland and the immune system in both birds and mammals (including humans) (1, 2). Developmental and age-related changes in pineal function appear, at least in part, to b...|$|R

40|$|Vocal {{learning}} is a critical behavioral substrate for spoken human language. It is a rare trait found in three distantly related groups of birds-songbirds, hummingbirds, and parrots. These avian groups have remarkably similar systems of cerebral vocal nuclei for the control of learned vocalizations that are not found in their more closely related vocal non-learning relatives. These findings led to the hypothesis that brain pathways for vocal learning in different groups evolved independently from a common ancestor but under pre-existing constraints. Here, we suggest one constraint, a pre-existing system for movement control. Using behavioral molecular mapping, we discovered that in songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds, all cerebral vocal learning nuclei are adjacent to discrete brain areas active during limb and body movements. Similar to the relationships between vocal nuclei activation and singing, activation in the adjacent areas correlated {{with the amount of}} movement performed and was independent of auditory and visual input. These same movement-associated brain areas were also present in female songbirds that do not learn vocalizations and have atrophied cerebral vocal nuclei, and in <b>ring</b> <b>doves</b> that are vocal non-learners and do not have cerebral vocal nuclei. A compilation of previous neural tracing experiments in songbirds suggests that the movement-associated areas are connected in a network that is in parallel with the adjacent vocal learning system. This study is the first global mapping that we are aware for movement-associated areas of the avian cerebrum and it indicates that brain systems that control vocal learning in distantl...|$|R
