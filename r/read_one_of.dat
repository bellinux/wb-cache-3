5|$|The Shooting Star shared plot {{similarities}} with The Chase of the Golden Meteor, a 1908 {{novel by}} pioneering French science-fiction writer Jules Verne. As in Hergé's story, Verne's novel features {{an expedition to}} the North Atlantic to find a meteorite fragment containing a new element. In both stories, the competing expedition teams were led by an eccentric professor and a Jewish banker, and Verne's novel had a Doktor Schultze to Hergé's Professor Schulze—both from the University of Jena. Hergé denied deliberately copying Verne's story, {{saying that he had}} only <b>read</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the French novelist's works; {{it is possible that the}} influence from Verne came via Jacques Van Melkebeke, Hergé's friend and assistant, who was a fan of the genre. The Swedish expedition member Eric Björgenskjöld physically resembles a real person: Auguste Piccard, who later became Hergé's inspiration for Professor Calculus.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} the package on April 18, 2007, NBC contacted authorities {{and made the}} controversial decision to publicize Cho's communications by releasing {{a small fraction of}} what it received. After pictures and images from the videos were broadcast in numerous news reports, students and faculty from Virginia Tech, along with relatives of victims of the campus shooting, expressed concerns that glorifying Cho's rampage could lead to copycat killings. The airing of the manifesto and its video images and pictures was upsetting to many who were more closely affected by the shootings: Peter Read, the father of Mary <b>Read,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the students who was killed by Cho during the rampage, asked the media to stop airing Cho's manifesto.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, {{at the age}} of 50, he made a life-changing {{decision}} and entered the Community of the Resurrection. It had been thought that one day he would be made a bishop, but his earlier breakdown and now his entering religious life, ended any possibility of entering the episcopate. After more than two years as a postulant, he took his religious vows and officially became a monk on 1 January 1972.

25|$|The University of Leeds was the {{alma mater}} of Herbert <b>Read,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the leading {{international}} theorists {{of modern art}} from the mid-twentieth century, and also the teaching base for the Marxist art historian Arnold Hauser from 1951 to 1985. Partly due to Herbert Read's connection with the University, from 1950 to 1970 the University was the host {{of one of the}} first artist in residence schemes in Britain, using funding from the then owner of Lund Humphries books, Peter Gregory. The Gregory Fellowships, as the residencies were known, were given to painters and sculptors for up to two years to allow them to develop their own work and influence the University in any way they saw fit. Amongst those holding the fellowships were Kenneth Armitage, Reg Butler, Dennis Creffield and Terry Frost and others. Parallel Gregory Fellowships also existed in music and poetry at the University.|$|E

[...] He retreats into his office when he realizes that he never came close to that dream. Toby talks to Michael, who decides to start online dating (with the user name [...] "Little Kid Lover").

500|$|Attendances at {{the church}} were small until, {{during one of the}} services, Prince acted as if he was possessed, {{throwing}} himself around the church. Congregations grew each week as the [...] "possession" [...] was repeated. The congregation were then divided with separate services for men and women. Subsequently, he separated them again into sinners and the righteous, which generally included females who were wealthy. The bishop was summoned to investigate the practices. By that time, Prince had contracted his first [...] "spiritual marriage" [...] and had persuaded himself that he had been absorbed into the personality of God and become a visible embodiment of the Holy Spirit. During his illness Starkey <b>read</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his curate's sermons, and was not only [...] "cured" [...] forthwith, but embraced his strange doctrines. Together they procured many conversions in the countryside and the neighbouring towns. In the end the rector was deprived of his living and Prince was defrocked. Together with a few disciples they started the Charlinch Free Church, which had a very brief existence, meeting in a supportive farmer's barn.|$|E
500|$|In {{the season}} eight episodes [...] "Instinct" [...] and [...] "Bloodline", Tess learns about Krypton {{and the name}} [...] "Kal-El", though she does not {{attribute}} any of the information directly to Clark. In [...] "Bulletproof", it is revealed that Tess knows where Lex is. Here, Lana informs Tess that Lex surgically implanted a nano-transmitter into Tess's optic nerve {{so that he could}} keep an eye on everything she is doing. Visibly upset by this, Tess places a jamming device into her necklace to disrupt the signal, but not before telling Lex that she will cut him off from the outside world and sell off everything that he owns. In the episode [...] "Requiem", it is revealed that Tess sold controlling interest in LuthorCorp to Queen Industries. In [...] "Turbulence", Tess tries to get Clark to reveal his powers after she <b>read</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Lionel Luthor's journals that identified Clark as [...] "The Traveler", but her effort failed. In the episode [...] "Eternal", it is shown that Tess has the Kryptonian orb that brought down the Fortress of Solitude, and in [...] "Injustice" [...] a disembodied voice emanates from the orb revealing that Tess's recent actions to get Clark to reveal his powers and kill Doomsday are because the voice was instructing her to do so. In the season eight finale, the orb activates itself and transports Zod to Smallville.|$|E

500|$|The Gunnerkrigg Court webcomic is told in {{a series}} of episodic {{chapters}} such that each, while forming part of the overall storyline, also functions individually as a stand-alone story arc."Each of the chapters individually is sort of a self-contained thing, so if you were to just <b>read</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> them it wouldn't be like you {{had no idea what was}} going on." [...] The themes and topics of the chapters vary widely: as one reviewer describes, [...] "You are also not subjected to 400-plus pages of intricate plot movement. While there is an overall story arc, there are also lighter chapters that focus on unusual classes ... or small moments that build the main characters." [...] Each chapter begins with a title page and ends with one or more [...] "bonus pages," [...] which are not integral to the main storyline but often offer ancillary details about the world of Gunnerkrigg Court or about minor characters. [...] The chapters have varied in length from four pages to more than eighty. [...] Each page is drawn in traditional (A4; 210 × 297mm) page format and divided arbitrarily into frames. At the bottom of the most recent page is a link to a comments thread for that page, in which readers may comment on and discuss that day's comic.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{punishable}} by death if discovered, many inmates of the camp, both civilian and POW, kept diaries and notes about their imprisonment. One of Agnes' fellow female internees, Hilda E.

Mrs A.K. — a noted American novelist, who proposes to [...] a book on our life here.

2500|$|There is {{also the}} {{question}} of the influence of such interpretations in people's behaviour. In 2008, psychologists Kathleen Vohs and Jonathan Schooler published a study on how people behave when they are prompted to think that determinism is true. They asked their subjects to <b>read</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> two passages: one suggesting that behaviour boils down to environmental or genetic factors not under personal control; the other neutral about what influences behaviour. The participants then did a few math problems on a computer. But just before the test started, they were informed that because of a glitch in the computer it occasionally displayed the answer by accident; if this happened, they were to click it away without looking. Those who had read the deterministic message were more likely to cheat on the test. [...] "Perhaps, denying free will simply provides the ultimate excuse to behave as one likes," [...] Vohs and Schooler suggested.|$|E
