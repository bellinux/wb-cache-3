25|$|Lactone diol 2.1, after {{selective}} protection, {{was reduced}} with lithium aluminium hydride to give triol 2.4.

25|$|As {{illustrated}} in Retrosynthetic Scheme I, Taxol {{was derived from}} diol 7.2 by an ester bond formation, according to the Ojima-Holton method. This diol comes from carbonate 6.3 {{by the addition of}} phenyllithium. The oxetane ring in compound 6.3 was obtained via an SN2 reaction involving a mesylate derived from acetate 4.9. <b>Ring</b> <b>B</b> was closed via a McMurry reaction involving dialdehyde 4.8 which ultimately was derived from aldehyde 4.2 and hydrazone 3.6 using a Shapiro coupling reaction.|$|E
25|$|A Shapiro {{reaction}} of the vinyllithium compound derived from hydrazone 4.1 with aldehyde 4.2 makes the first connection that will become the B ring. The control of stereochemistry in 4.3 {{is thought to be}} derived from the relative hindrance of the Si face in the orientation shown on the right, due to the proximity of the axial methyl group. Epoxidation with vanadyl(acetylacetate) converted alkene 4.3 to epoxide 4.4, which, upon reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, gave diol 4.5. This diol was then protected as carbonate ester 4.6. The carbonate group also served to create rigidity in the ring structure for the imminent pinacol coupling reaction. The two silyl ether groups were removed, and diol 4.7 was then oxidized to give dialdehyde 4.8 using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of tetrapropylammonium perruthenate. In the final step of the formation of <b>Ring</b> <b>B,</b> a pinacol coupling using conditions developed by McMurry (titanium(III) chloride and a zinc/copper alloy) gave diol 4.9.|$|E

Recently, O-GlcNAc {{has been linked}} to human embryonic stem cells (hESC) differentiation, however the identity and function of O-GlcNAc proteins regulating hESC remain unknown. Here, we firstly identified O-GlcNAc modified human stem cell regulators such as hnRNP K, HP 1 γ, and especially RING 1 B/RNF 2. Thereafter, we focused our work on <b>RING</b> 1 <b>B</b> which is the catalytic subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1) a major epigenetic repressor essential for pluripotency maintenance and differentiation. By point-mutation, we show that T 250 /S 251 and S 278 <b>RING</b> 1 <b>B</b> residues are bearing O-GlcNAc, and that T 250 /S 251 O-GlcNAcylation decreases during differentiation. O-GlcNAc seems to regulate RING 1 B-DNA binding as suggested by our ChIP-sequencing results. Non-O-GlcNAcylated <b>RING</b> 1 <b>B</b> is found to be enriched near cell cycle genes whereas O-GlcNAcylated <b>RING</b> 1 <b>B</b> seems preferentially enriched near neuronal genes. Our data suggest that during hESC differentiation, the decrease of <b>RING</b> 1 <b>B</b> O-GlcNAcylation might enable PRC 1 to switch its target to induce neuron differentiation.

40|$|Falcipain- 3, {{the major}} {{cysteine}} hemoglobinase {{from the human}} malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, is critical for parasite development and is considered as a promising chemotherapeutic target. In {{order to understand the}} structure-activity correlation of falcipain- 3 inhibitors, a set of ligand-and receptor-based 3 D-QSAR models were developed in the present work employing comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) for 247 2 -pyrimidinecarbonitrile derivatives. An optimum ligand-based CoMSIA model yielded a cross validation Q(2) = 0. 501, non-cross validation R-ncv(2) = 0. 821 and predictive R-pred(2) = 0. 750. In addition, docking analysis and molecular dynamics simulation were applied to elucidate the probable binding modes of the ligand in the falcipain- 3 binding pocket. Graphic representation of the results, as contoured 3 D coefficient plots, also provides a clue to the reasonable modification of molecules. (1) Bulky substituents at the 3 -position, and <b>rings</b> <b>B</b> and D increase the biological activity; (2) electrostatic groups at <b>rings</b> <b>B,</b> C and D are likely helpful to increase the falcipain- 3 inhibition; (3) hydrophobic groups at <b>rings</b> <b>B</b> and D are favored; (4) Gly 92, Ile 94 and Thr 95 which formed several H-bonds and a water-bridged H-bond are crucial for falcipain- 3 inhibitors.

50|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of <b>ring</b> <b>B</b> (see Fig. 2) {{begins with}} the natural amino acid L-tyrosine. This is then adenylated and thioesterified onto the peptidyl carrier protein (PCP) of NovH by ATP and NovH itself. NovI then further modifies this PCP bound molecule by oxidizing the β-position using NADPH and molecular oxygen. NovJ and NovK form a heterodimer of J2K2 which is the active form of this benzylic oxygenase. This process uses NADP+ as a hydride acceptor in the oxidation of the β-alcohol. This ketone will prefer to exist in its enol tautomer in solution. Next a still unidentified protein catalyzes the selective oxidation of the benzene (as shown in Fig. 2). Upon oxidation this intermediate will spontaneously lactonize to form the aromatic <b>ring</b> <b>B</b> and lose NovH in the process.|$|E
