Previous research suggests that higher audit <b>fees</b> are expected <b>for</b> both larger clients and for industry specialization. We find that in the Australian market for audit services, the fee premium attributed to industry specialist audit firms is concentrated in the audit fees paid by the largest clients in each industry. One <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> higher <b>fees</b> paid by larger clients is the demand for additional audit services. We find higher <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> companies cross-listed on US exchanges. We also find that fee premiums to auditors that are city-industry leaders are strongly related to client size. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Background: Physical {{and mental}} illness present {{substantial}} challenges to college students and authorities. Aims: (1) To characterize medical and psychiatric <b>reasons</b> underlying requests <b>for</b> <b>fees</b> waivers at an Irish third-level college; (2) to identify information included in applications; and (3) to develop proposals for standardizing applications. Methods: We examined all applications <b>for</b> exemption from <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> medical or psychiatric reasons over two academic years at an Irish third-level college. Results: Two hundred and twenty-two students applied for exemptions; 91 % were successful. Psychiatric problems were more common than physical illness (64. 1 vs. 27. 9 %). There was wide variation in details provided in applications with few providing details on likely ongoing duration of illness (5. 0 %). Conclusions: We recommend that (a) a structured medical application form be completed by medical practitioners supporting applications; (b) a medical practitioner review applications; and (c) there should be annual re-audit of this process...|$|R

40|$|Extraordinary high fees {{received}} by the auditors from their clients during the recent financial crisis have attracted public attention. However, <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> high <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> audit service are obscure. Many studies have proved {{the importance of the}} client size, complexity, risks and the auditor status in determination of audit fees. Another determinant, the non-audit fee, has been intensively debated in the literature. The <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> this is that the audit and non-audit fees are not correlated in the way many researchers have expected. Namely, the vast majority of research has reported a positive association between two services. Many explanations for the phenomenon have been set forward. However, real <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> such association remain unclear and the consensus between researchers is lacking. The study of the correlation between the two types of expenditures in the Swedish audit environment during a long time period may shed some light on this complex phenomenon. Some evidence suggest that an economic downturn can affect the relationship between audit and non-audit fees and their ratios. Therefore, the recent financial crisis provides an excellent opportunity to examine a possible relationship. Using the data from Middle Cap and Small Cap Swedish companies, this study investigates the relationship between audit and non-audit fees and their ratios during three periods of different economic conditions: favorable 2006 - 2007, economic downturn 2008 - 2009 and post crisis period 2010 - 2011. In this study I tested a number of hypotheses. Firstly, I investigated the suggestion that the relationship between audit and non-audit fees in Sweden, like in many other countries, is positive. Secondly, I tested the hypothesis that economic fluctuations affect this relationship. Thirdly, I explored my prediction that the economic downturn influences the ratios of audit and non-audit fees. I have shown that the relationship between audit and non-audit services is positive during the whole investigated period. According to these results, the relationship is not affected by different economic conditions. Furthermore, I have found out that the financial crisis affected the audit and non-audit fee ratios. The ratio of the audit fee increased during the crisis and continued to increase during the post-crisis period. The ratio of non-audit fee decreased in the same proportion. ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the impact of audit committee existence, the frequency of audit committee meetings and the auditor's attendance at meetings on aspects of the external audit. Using an experimental design, {{we find that the}} audit committee, the frequency of committee meetings and the auditor's attendance at meetings are significantly associated with a reduction in perceived audit risk. The impact on audit efficiency and audit testing is perceived to be minimal. Manager and partner hours are greater when meetings are more frequent and the partner attends all meetings. The audit committee is expected to provide assistance in resolving conflicts with management and to lead to some improvement in overall audit quality. In neither case is this affected by meeting frequency or the auditor's attendance at meetings. Participants expect the existence of an audit committee to lead to an increase in audit fees, particularly when meetings are more frequent and the auditor is required to attend meetings. <b>Reasons</b> given <b>for</b> any <b>fee</b> increase relate to the additional preparation for and attendance at meetings...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{examines}} {{public support}} <b>for</b> new user <b>fees</b> {{established at the}} Desolation Wilderness in California {{as part of the}} Fee Demonstration Program. Traditional approaches to fee policy evaluations have typically focused on economic or revenue issues and equity impacts of various pricing strategies. Support <b>for</b> <b>fees</b> has been shown to vary by users in terms of attitudes toward fees, nature of usage or behaviors, and demographics. Fee support may also vary by the type of recreation or resource area, {{especially in the case of}} dispersed recreation areas such as wilderness or other sites, which have historically been provided by tax dollars. To evaluate the role of new fees on public support for spending revenues, this paper compares ratings of support for the use of <b>fees</b> <b>for</b> 19 different management activities, assuming two different rationales across two user group samples. One rationale asks about support <b>for</b> <b>fees</b> to improve upon the current level of service, while the other asks about support <b>For</b> <b>fees</b> to provide the current level of service.
