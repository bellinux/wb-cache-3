40|$|A new method, <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, for {{decreasing}} N 2 O from {{fluidised bed}} combustion, {{was investigated in}} a 12 MW circulating fluidised bed boiler. Previous measurements, showing that the N 2 O is decreased to one fourth (25 ppm), and NO to half(40 ppm) with maintained sulphur capture, were confirmed. Supplementary information on <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging was obtained from additional measurements. By adjusting the temperature and the air ratio {{it was possible to}} reduce the CO emission. Thus, the N 2 O emission can be reduced to the level of 25 ppm, with the emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO maintained at about same level as with normal air staging. Low load in combination with <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging resulted in:further reduced emissions. The effect of <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging on the emissions from peat {{is similar to that of}} bituminous coal.

40|$|Abstract - Two {{methods for}} the {{reduction}} of nitrous oxide emissions, afterbuming and <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, are investigated in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. With afterburning the N 2 O emission can be reduced by 90 % or more, using an amount of secondary fuel corresponding to 10 % of the total energy input. With <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging {{it is possible to}} reduce the emission of N 2 O to one fourth (25 ppm), without significantly affecting the other emissions. With <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging no secondary air is used in the combustor and an air-ratio of about unity is maintained throughout the combustion chamber.

40|$|<b>Reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging is {{a method}} to reduce nitrous oxide (N 2 O) {{emissions}} from circulating fluidized bed boilers (FBBs). Tests in a 12 MW circulating FBB show that the N 20 emission can be lowered to one fourth without affecting the emissions of NO,SO 2 or CO and without adverse effects on the combustion efficiency. The focus of the paper is on the conditions in the combustion chamber. Measurements inside the combustion chamber reveal how the combustion conditions are affected by <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging compared to normal air staging. These measurements confirm the working principle of <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, namely to provide more oxidizing conditions in {{the lower part of}} the combustion chamber and lower stoichiometry in the upper part of the combustion chamber...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} make clear how the efflux angle changes in a small {{crankcase}} scavenged engine cylinder and in a large loop scavenged engine cylinder, the inlet flow pattern in the single cycle model cylinder has been observed by a high speed motion camera. In general, the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> stream is not effluent in the designed direction of the scavenging port at comparatively slight opening, and the efflux angle changes in proportion to port opening advance. In a small crankcase scavenged engine cylinder, to keep the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> stream {{in the direction of}} the scavenging port it is effective to incline the <b>scavenging</b> <b>air</b> passage between the crankcase and the cylinder, and to make thicker the cylinder wall where located scavenging port.

40|$|The {{authors have}} {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} two high efficiency steel filters in the exhaust of an uranium oxide grit blaster at the Y- 12 Plant in Oak Ridge Tennessee. The filters were installed in a specially designed filter housing with a reverse air-pulse cleaning system for automatically cleaning the filters in-place. Previous tests conducted on the same filters and housing at LLNL under controlled conditions using Arizona road dust showed good cleanability with <b>reverse</b> <b>air</b> pulses. Two high efficiency steel filters, containing 64 pleated cartridge elements housed in the standard 2 {prime} x 2 {prime} {times} l{prime} HEPA frame, were evaluated in the filter test housing using a 1, 000 cfm slip stream containing {{a high concentration of}} depleted uranium oxide dust. One filter had the pleated cartridges manufactured to the authors specifications by the Pall Corporation and the other by Memtec Corporation. Test results showed both filters had a rapid increase in pressure drop with time, and <b>reverse</b> <b>air</b> pulses could not decrease the pressure drop. The authors suspected moisture accumulation in the filters was the problem since there were heavy rains during the evaluations, and the pressure drop of the Memtec filter decreased dramatically after passing clean, dry air through the filter and after the filter sat idle for one week. Subsequent laboratory tests on a single filter cartridge confirmed that water accumulation in the filter was responsible for the increase in filter pressure drop and the inability to lower the pressure drop by <b>reverse</b> <b>air</b> pulses. No effort was made to identify the source of the water accumulation and correct the problem because the available funds were exhausted...|$|R

40|$|<b>Reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging, {{a method}} for {{reduction}} of N 2 O emissions, was studied in a 12 MW circulating fluidized bed boiler. The effect of combustor air-ratio, bed temperature, load and limestone addition ratio was investigated. The results indicate that if only the air distribution is changed, the emission of N 2 O can be decreased to one fourth compared to normal air staging at a temperature of 850 °C, with maintained low emissions of NO,´SO 2 and CO. With increased bed temperature, 870 °C, in combination with increased limestone addition, from Ca/S molar ratio = 3 to 4, {{it was possible to}} reduce N 2 O by 90 vol% with low emissions of NO, SO 2 and CO. The method was less efficient at low load, because of the lower cyclone temperature. Also the effect of redistribution of some of the air added in the cyclone outlet to the cyclone inlet was studied. This did not, however, give any improvement in the boiler used compared to adding all of the air in the cyclone outlet. There {{was no significant difference in}} combustion efficiency between <b>reversed</b> <b>air</b> staging and normal air staging...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTightening European {{standards}} on fuel consumption and pollutant emissions reduction {{lead to a}} sophistication of engine concepts and associated control. Since few years, downsizing (reduction of the engine displacement) appears as a major way to achieve those requirements for spark ignition engines. Efficient performance and drivability can be then achieved with a direct injection downsized engine with turbocharging and Variable Camshaft Timing (VCT). One of the major issues of the torque-oriented control is in-cylinder mass observation and control. To have an efficient torque response, the in-cylinder trapped mass, adjusted by the throttle and the waste gate, must be controlled with accuracy according to performance and drivability requirements. Depending on admission and exhaust pressures, the twin VCT will allow to control in-cylinder burned gases rate {{to reduce fuel consumption}} and pollutant emissions, and <b>air</b> <b>scavenging</b> to improve transient speed response. Another major issue is in-cylinder trapped mass and <b>air</b> <b>scavenging</b> prediction for AFR control. In this paper, we propose a model-based approach to achieve those engine control issues. The first challenge is to design accurate observers for non-measurable variables (in-cylinder burned gases and trapped air mass). The method is based on a complex high frequency 0 D engine model, which has been validated on a large range of engine operating points and transient operations based on test bed results. Then, this model permits to design and learn open-loop nonlinear static observers of in-cylinder masses (based on neural network). The static and dynamic behavior of high frequency 0 D engine model allows to achieve design of dynamic and closed-loop in-cylinder mass observation and prediction, multivariable and non-linear control of air path according to in-cylinder mass trajectory (trapped air mass & recirculated gases rate). Then, the complete engine control can be developed and validated on simulation and on a real time Software-In-the-Loop platform based on high frequency 0 D engine model, before a complete validation and calibration on test bed. Finally, the complete torque-oriented engine control has been integrated on vehicle. From 0 D engine model, a complete vehicle model has been set on real-time platform in order to validate engine control integration and design vehicle layout. The major issue is then supervision of engine control set points (torque, AFR, efficiency) according to engine states (start, idle, driver request, cut-off) and warm-up strategies...|$|R

The use of halothane is associated with hepatitis but the adverse effects of newer halogenated hydrocarbons are less well recognised. Chronic exposure may cause reduction in antioxidant activity in plasma and erythrocytes, inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis, depression of central neuro-respiratory activity, increased DNA breaks, effects on cerebral blood circulation and altered renal function. Inhalational anaesthetics also have adverse environmental effects, including ozone damage and greenhouse gas effects.
