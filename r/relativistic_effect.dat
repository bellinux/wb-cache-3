5|$|A direct <b>relativistic</b> <b>effect</b> {{is that as}} atomic {{numbers of}} {{elements}} increase, the innermost electrons begin to revolve faster around the nucleus {{as a result of}} the increase of the electromagnetic attraction between an electron and a nucleus. Similar effects have been found for s orbitals (and p1/2 ones, though this is not quite applicable for dubnium): for example, the 7s orbital is contracted by 25% in size and stabilized by 2.6 eV.|$|E
5|$|Some redshifts are {{an example}} of the Doppler effect, {{familiar}} in the change of apparent pitches of sirens and frequency of the sound waves emitted by speeding vehicles. A redshift occurs whenever a light source moves away from an observer. A special instance of this is the cosmological redshift, which is due to the expansion of the universe, and sufficiently distant light sources (generally more than a few million light years away) show redshift corresponding to the rate of increase in their distance from Earth. Finally, gravitational redshift is a <b>relativistic</b> <b>effect</b> observed in electromagnetic radiation moving out of gravitational fields. Conversely, a decrease in wavelength is called blueshift and is generally seen when a light-emitting object moves toward an observer or when electromagnetic radiation moves into a gravitational field. However, redshift is a more common term and sometimes blueshift is referred to as negative redshift.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in the 4f-subshell, which is progressively filled from cerium (element 58) to ytterbium (element 70), {{are not particularly}} effective at shielding the increasing nuclear charge from the sub-shells further out. The elements immediately following the lanthanides have atomic radii that are smaller than would be expected and that are almost identical to the atomic radii of the elements immediately above them. Hence hafnium has virtually the same atomic radius (and chemistry) as zirconium, and tantalum has an atomic radius similar to niobium, and so forth. This {{is known as the}} lanthanide contraction. The effect of the lanthanide contraction is noticeable up to platinum (element 78), after which it is masked by a <b>relativistic</b> <b>effect</b> known as the inert pair effect. The d-block contraction, which is a similar effect between the d-block and p-block, is less pronounced than the lanthanide contraction but arises from a similar cause.|$|E

40|$|Using {{idealized}} {{models of}} the accretion disk we investigate the <b>relativistic</b> <b>effects</b> on the energy deposition rate via neutrino pair annihilation near the rotation axis of a Kerr black hole. Neutrinos are emitted from the accretion disk. The bending of neutrino trajectories and the redshift due to the disk rotation and gravitation are taken into consideration. The Kerr parameter, $a$, affects not only neutrinos' behavior but also the inner radius of the accretion disk. When the deposition energy is mainly contributed by the neutrinos coming from the central part, the redshift effect becomes dominant as $a$ becomes large and the energy deposition rate is reduced compared with that neglecting the <b>relativistic</b> <b>effects.</b> On the other hand, for small $a$ the bending effect gets dominant and makes energy increase by factor 2 compared with that neglecting the <b>relativistic</b> <b>effects.</b> For the disk with temperature gradient, the energy deposition rate for a small inner radius of the accretion disk is smaller than that estimated by neglecting the <b>relativistic</b> <b>effects.</b> The <b>relativistic</b> <b>effects,</b> especially for large $a$, play a negative role in avoiding the baryon contamination problem in gamma-ray bursts.
