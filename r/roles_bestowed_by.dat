25|$|The {{person who}} governed the nad {{was known as}} the naduvazhi. It was an {{inherited}} <b>role,</b> originally <b>bestowed</b> <b>by</b> a king, and of a lower ritual rank than the royal lineages. Although Nair families, they generally used the title of Samantan and were treated as vassals. However, some naduvazhi were feudatory chiefs, former kings whose territory had been taken over by, for example, the Zamorins of Calicut. In these instances, although they were obeisant to the rajah they held a higher ritual rank than the Zamorin as a consequence of their longer history of government; they also had more power than the vassal chiefs. The naduvazhi families each saw themselves as a distinct caste {{in the same manner as}} did the rajahs; they did not recognise other naduvazhi families as being equal to them. The naduvazhi maintained criminal and civil order and could demand military service from all Nairs below him. There was usually a permanent force of between 500 and 1000 men available and these were called upon by the rajah when required. All fighting was usually suspended during the monsoon period of May to September, when movement around the country was almost impossible. Roads did not exist, nor wheeled vehicles or pack animals, until after 1766.|$|R

40|$|Heat shock protein 70 (HSP 70) plays a vital <b>role</b> <b>by</b> <b>bestowing</b> cytoprotection {{against diverse}} kinds of stresses. The {{ubiquitous}} HSP 70 proteins {{are the most}} abundant and temperature sensitive among all the HSPs. The present paper has characterized HSP 70 - 1 cDNA in goat (Capra hircus). Total RNA isolated from goat {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} was reverse transcribed to cDNA that was used for amplification of HSP 70 - 1 gene. PCR product (1926 [*]bp) was cloned in pGEM-T easy vector and sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed 1926 -bp-long open reading frame of HSP 70 - 1 gene encoding 641 amino acids in goat, as reported in cattle. At nucleotide level, goat HSP 70 - 1 was found to be 96 – 99 % similar to that of sheep (partial), cattle, and buffalo whereas the similarity at amino acid level was 95 – 100 %. Nonsynonymous substitutions exceeding synonymous substitutions indicate the evolution of this protein through positive selection among domestic animals. Goat and sheep appear to have diverged from a common ancestor in phylogenetic analysis. Predicted protein structures of goat HSP 70 protein obtained from deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the functional amino acids involved in chaperoning through ATPase hydrolytic cycle and in uncoating of clathrin coated vesicles are highly conserved...|$|R
