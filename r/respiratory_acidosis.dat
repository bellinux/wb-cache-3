5|$|Unlike diethyl ether, {{methoxyflurane}} is {{a significant}} respiratory depressant. In dogs, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in respiratory rate and a marked decrease in respiratory minute volume, with a relatively mild decrease in tidal volume. In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant. The net effect of these changes is profound respiratory depression, as evidenced by CO2 retention with a concomitant decrease in arterial pH (this {{is referred to as}} a <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis)</b> when anesthetized subjects are allowed to breathe spontaneously for any length of time.|$|E
5|$|The {{chloride}} anion is {{an essential}} nutrient for metabolism. Chlorine is needed {{for the production of}} hydrochloric acid in the stomach and in cellular pump functions. The main dietary source is table salt, or sodium chloride. Overly low or high concentrations of chloride in the blood are examples of electrolyte disturbances. Hypochloremia (having too little chloride) rarely occurs in the absence of other abnormalities. Its sometimes associated with hypoventilation. It can be associated with chronic <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Hyperchloremia (having too much chloride) usually does not produce symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they tend to resemble those of hypernatremia (having too much sodium). Reduction in blood chloride leads to cerebral dehydration; symptoms are most often caused by rapid rehydration which results in cerebral edema. Hyperchloremia can affect oxygen transport.|$|E
5|$|Intubation may be {{necessary}} for a patient with decreased oxygen content and oxygen saturation of the blood caused when their breathing is inadequate (hypoventilation), suspended (apnea), or when the lungs are unable to sufficiently transfer gasses to the blood. Such patients, who may be awake and alert, are typically critically ill with a multisystem disease or multiple severe injuries. Examples of such conditions include cervical spine injury, multiple rib fractures, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or near-drowning. Specifically, intubation is considered if the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) is less than 60millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) while breathing an inspired O2 concentration (FIO2) of 50% or greater. In patients with elevated arterial carbon dioxide, an arterial partial pressure of CO2 (PaCO2) greater than 45mm Hg {{in the setting of}} acidemia would prompt intubation, especially if a series of measurements demonstrate a worsening <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Regardless of the laboratory values, these guidelines are always interpreted in the clinical context.|$|E
40|$|Several {{prognostic}} markers {{have been}} identified for patients admitted with acute cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Most of the markers are based on clinical risk scores.

25|$|Bicarbonate ions {{are crucial}} for {{regulating}} blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences {{the level of}} CO2 in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis,</b> while breathing that is too rapid leads to hyperventilation, which can cause respiratory alkalosis.|$|E
25|$|Hypercapnia is {{generally}} {{defined as a}} blood gas carbon dioxide level over 45 mmHg. Since carbon dioxide is in equilibrium with carbonic acid in the blood, hypercapnia can drive serum pH down, resulting in a <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis.</b> Clinically, the effect of hypercapnia on pH is estimated using {{the ratio of the}} arterial pressure of carbon dioxide to the concentration of bicarbonate ion, PaCO2/.|$|E
50|$|Respiratory alkalosis is {{very rarely}} life-threatening, though pH level {{should not be}} 7.5 or greater. The aim in {{treatment}} is to detect the underlying cause. When PaCO2 is adjusted rapidly in individuals with chronic <b>respiratory</b> alkalosis, metabolic <b>acidosis</b> may occur. If the individual is on a mechanical ventilator then preventing hyperventilation is done via monitoring ABG levels.|$|R
30|$|Conclusion: Our {{study shows}} that in a large {{population}} of adults admitted to ICU for SIM, 7.5 % have a community-acquired co-infection, mainly bacteraemias and pulmonary infections. These results emphasize the need to search for co-infection in these patients and make therapeutic adaptations accordingly. Male sex, <b>respiratory</b> distress and <b>acidosis</b> at admission may help to identify patients most at risk.|$|R

25|$|Hypercapnia is {{generally}} caused by hypoventilation, lung disease, or diminished consciousness. It {{may also be}} caused by exposure to environments containing abnormally high concentrations of carbon dioxide, such as from volcanic or geothermal activity, or by rebreathing exhaled carbon dioxide. It can also be an initial effect of administering supplemental oxygen on a patient with sleep apnea. In this situation the hypercapnia can also be accompanied by <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Intravenous sodium {{bicarbonate}} is an aqueous solution that is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions {{are in the}} blood. In cases of <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis,</b> the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. It {{is for this reason}} that {{sodium bicarbonate}} is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is markedly (<7.1–7.0) low.|$|E
25|$|If these homeostats are compromised, then a <b>{{respiratory}}</b> <b>acidosis,</b> or a {{respiratory alkalosis}} will occur. In {{the long run}} these can be compensated by renal adjustments to the H+ and HCO3− concentrations in the plasma; but since this takes time, the hyperventilation syndrome can, for instance, occur when agitation or anxiety cause a person to breathe fast and deeply thus causing a distressing respiratory alkalosis through the blowing off of too much CO2 from the blood into the outside air.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} i. c. v. {{administered}} dermorphin, a highly selective 1 z-OpiOid agonist, on cardiac function and renal, mesentenc and hindquarter blood flow were studied in conscious rats.

40|$|BACKGROUND: To secure pH homeostasis, {{the central}} {{respiratory}} network must permanently adapt its rhythmic motor drive to environment and behaviour. In neonates, {{it is commonly}} admitted that the retrotrapezoid/parafacial respiratory group of neurons of the ventral medulla plays the primary role in the <b>respiratory</b> response to <b>acidosis,</b> although the serotonergic system may also contribute to this response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using en bloc medullary preparations from neonatal mice, we have shown {{for the first time}} that the <b>respiratory</b> response to <b>acidosis</b> is abolished after pre-treatment with the serotonin-transporter blocker fluoxetine (25 - 50 µM, 20 min), a commonly used antidepressant. Using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have also shown the expression of the serotonin transporter mRNA and serotonin-containing neurons in the vicinity of the RTN/pFRG of neonatal mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results reveal that the serotonergic system plays a pivotal role in pH homeostasis. Although obtained in vitro in neonatal mice, they suggest that drugs targeting the serotonergic system should be used with caution in infants, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers...|$|R

Nevertheless, acid–base balance was relatively unaffected in the severely septic rats with only mild hypocapnia and hyperlactataemia.|$|R

2500|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that the decline in lung function observed in chronic bronchitis may be slowed with smoking cessation. Chronic bronchitis is treated symptomatically and may be treated in a nonpharmacologic manner or with pharmacologic therapeutic agents. Typical nonpharmacologic approaches to the management of COPD including bronchitis may include: pulmonary rehabilitation, lung volume reduction surgery, and lung transplantation. Inflammation and edema of the respiratory epithelium may be reduced with inhaled corticosteroids. Wheezing and shortness of breath can be treated by reducing bronchospasm (reversible narrowing of smaller bronchi due to constriction of the smooth muscle) [...] with bronchodilators such as inhaled long acting β2-adrenergic receptor agonists (e.g., salmeterol) and inhaled anticholinergics such as ipratropium bromide or tiotropium bromide. Mucolytics may have a small therapeutic effect on acute exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Supplemental oxygen is used to treat hypoxemia (too little oxygen in the blood) and {{has been shown to}} reduce mortality in chronic bronchitis patients. Oxygen supplementation can result in decreased respiratory drive, leading to increased blood levels of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) and subsequent <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis.</b>|$|E

50|$|One key to {{distinguish}} between respiratory and metabolic acidosis is that in <b>respiratory</b> <b>acidosis,</b> the CO2 is increased while the bicarbonate is either normal (uncompensated) or increased (compensated).
