5|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while, despite examination by Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues, including the Employee Free Choice Act. Several days later, Senate <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination because of her unwillingness to answer questions in detail in the hearings. By January 23, a secret hold {{was placed on the}} nomination by an anonymous Republican. A series of written questions and responses between Republican members and Solis followed, during which she was more forthcoming. Republican Mike Enzi pressed her on whether her unpaid high-level positions at American Rights at Work constituted prohibited lobbying activity; Solis denied violation of rules of conduct and stated she had not helped lobbying. Solis did acknowledge that she had failed to report those positions on her annual House financial disclosure forms at the time, which a White House spokesperson argued was an unintentional oversight. On February 2, Obama appointed veteran Labor Department official Edward C. Hugler as Acting Secretary. The prolonged process was considered by some Republican aides to be a preview of future battles on labor issues between the Obama administration and Republicans in Congress.|$|E
25|$|Of Harris's {{three primary}} opponents, only Will McBride {{endorsed}} her candidacy {{for the general}} election. In {{the first few days}} after the primary, a number of Republican nominees such as Charlie Crist and Tom Lee went on a statewide unity tour with Gov. Bush. Harris was not invited; <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> the tour was only for nominees to statewide offices. Harris claimed Bush would campaign with her sometime in the two months before the election, but the governor's office denied this.|$|E
25|$|Romney had job {{approval}} ratings around 50percent {{for most of}} his term, but they began to decline towards the end of his term. A March 2005 poll found that only 32percent felt Romney should be re-elected if he ran for a second term as governor (69percent of <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> he should be re-elected, compared to 31percent of independents and 12percent of Democrats). Many in Massachusetts grew dissatisfied with Romney's frequent out-of-state travel and shift toward promoting socially conservative issues as he began to focus increasingly on national rather than state politics.|$|E
50|$|Ratzenberger, a <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> he {{considered}} {{running for the}} U.S. Senate in Connecticut in 2012.|$|R
2500|$|Senator Robert J. Barham, an Oak Ridge (Morehouse Parish) <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> of his fallen colleague: [...] "It will be surreal {{when you}} {{show up for the}} session and look for John Hainkel, and he won't be there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cupp, who {{identifies}} as a Log Cabin <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> the <b>Republican</b> Party should support gay marriage. She {{describes herself as}} a [...] "mainstream conservative" [...] and criticized Ron Paul's foreign policy views along with his views on the Federal Reserve.|$|R
25|$|Slave rebellions, by Gabriel Prosser (1800), Denmark Vesey (1822), Nat Turner (1831), {{and most}} famously by John Brown (1859), caused {{fear in the}} white South, which imposed stricter {{oversight}} of slaves and reduced the rights of free blacks. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 required the states to cooperate with slave owners when attempting to recover escaped slaves, which outraged Northerners. Formerly, an escaped slave that reached a non-slave state was presumed to have attained sanctuary and freedom under the Missouri Compromise. The Supreme Court's 1857 decision in Dred Scott v. Sandford ruled that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional; angry <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> this decision threatened to make slavery a national institution.|$|E
500|$|On October 7, the {{day before}} the Republican caucus {{scheduled}} a non-binding vote for speaker, Ryan and former Vice President Dick Cheney endorsed McCarthy, as did 11 of the 13 House Republicans from Pennsylvania. The Freedom Caucus decided to endorse Webster in the race. Other <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they would vote against McCarthy, including Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who called McCarthy [...] "absolutely not an option" [...] because of his previous role as Boehner's [...] "right-hand man". Also, Walter B. Jones, Jr. of North Carolina {{sent a letter to the}} Republican Conference Chairwoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers stating that any candidates for a leadership position with [...] "misdeeds" [...] should withdraw from the race. Jones has stated that his comment did not specifically refer to McCarthy, but it was widely seen as referring to rumors that McCarthy had been committing an extramarital affair with a fellow Representative, a rumor that both have denied; the basis for such an allegation and interpretation is unclear.|$|E
500|$|Despite funding {{increases}} for MDOT by the State Legislature, M-275 languished {{on the drawing}} boards. New plans in 1983 had addressed several of the environmental concerns by moving interchanges and rerouting around wetlands. These plans even canceled an extension of Northwestern Highway (then M-4, now part of M-10) to Pontiac Trail and a connection with M-275. The state increased MDOT's budget by $602 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ), but left the M-275 project off a priority list. The Southeast Michigan Council of Governments (SEMCOG) continued to factor M-275 into regional transportation planning forecasts. SEMCOG's position was that the location population that would be served by the new highway would rival 70 of Michigan's counties combined, yet there was no four-lane highways through the area. Opponents cited urban sprawl, which SEMCOG dismissed because the population {{was already in the}} area of the new highway. Transportation planners at an April 24, 1985, meeting of the West Bloomfield <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> that the highway extension [...] "would make sense" [...] but MDOT [...] "is planning no new freeways and no major road construction" [...] at the time. By the next month, MDOT had relinquished ownership of right-of-way in West Bloomfield Township, ending any further progress at building the roadway. Studies comparing the levels of traffic at various checkpoints along the existing I-275 showed that the freeway was only handling half of its rated capacity. At 8Mile Road, the freeway carried 57,000vehicles in 1977 and 88,000vehicles in 1984. This compared to a 1986 projection of 133,000vehicles daily.|$|E
5000|$|The Springfield <b>Republican</b> <b>said</b> at his death; [...] "A steadfast {{sense of}} right {{determined}} his convictions and laid {{the course of his}} action. For this quality, together with his dignity, sound judgment and genuine good sense, he was much esteemed in his community." ...|$|R
5000|$|During the campaign, Plescia {{generated}} controversy {{after running}} ads that accused Block of siding with teachers who sexually abused students. However, Block had actually voted against a procedural maneuver, not the bill itself. San Diego Assemblyman Nathan Fletcher, a former <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> that Plescia was [...] "playing politics" [...] with his accusation against Block.|$|R
2500|$|The Cuban thaw has {{received}} a mixed reception among politicians in the United States. Prominent critics include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. Rubio, a Cuban-American <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "diplomatic recognition [...] provide legitimacy to a government that doesn't deserve it." [...] The 2014 congressional elections were a month prior to {{the announcement of the}} thaw.|$|R
2500|$|Solis's {{confirmation}} hearings were held on January 9, 2009, before the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. [...] Committee chair Ted Kennedy repeatedly praised her, while despite some prodding from Republican members, Solis {{declined to discuss}} specific policy issues including the Employee Free Choice Act. [...] Several days later, Senate <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they might try to put a procedural hold on her nomination, out of frustration with her unwillingness to answer questions during the hearings.|$|E
2500|$|The rules {{prompted}} {{debate about}} the applicability of First Amendment protections to Internet service providers and edge providers. Republican Commissioner Ajit Pai said the Open Internet Order [...] "posed a special danger" [...] to [...] "First Amendment speech, freedom of expression, [...] even freedom of association." [...] Democratic member and then-Chairman Tom Wheeler said in response that the rules were [...] "no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept." [...] According to a Washington Post poll, 81% of Americans supported net neutrality in 2014. According to the poll, 81% of Democrats and 85% of <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they opposed fast lanes.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the time}} <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> [...] "any {{action will be}} taken by the voters in Lindner's district, who can decide whether to re-elect the six-term lawmaker." [...] Lindner who had been serving District 32A in the Minnesota House of Representatives since 1993, was denied the Republican {{endorsement}} in the 2004 elections. [...] Joyce Peppin who received the endorsement said it was because Lindner was [...] "a flawed messenger for the conservative agenda...You can't change hearts and minds when you are constantly offending people". He then ran as an independent. [...] In the general election the results were Joyce Peppin (R) 14,273 votes 53.8%, Caroll Holmstrom (D) 7,112 votes 26.8%, Arlon Lindner (I) 5,114 votes 19.3%; so Lindner failed in his re-election bid.|$|E
50|$|Patrick {{encouraged}} state Senator Lois Kolkhorst of Brenham {{to introduce}} a bathroom bill similar to a previous law adopted in 2016 in North Carolina, and strongly pushed for it at its proposal on January 5, 2017. Texas House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio, a moderate <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> that the measure is not an important matter for lower chamber.|$|R
50|$|Senate President Pro Tem Rob Mayer, a <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> on February 24 that {{he plans}} to propose a “right-to-work” bill next week. The Missouri Chamber of Commerce has {{announced}} its support of the bill, and both chambers of the legislature are controlled by Republicans. Democratic Governor Jay Nixon has yet to communicate his stance on the issue.|$|R
5000|$|The Cuban thaw has {{received}} a mixed reception among politicians in the United States. Prominent critics include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida.

[...] The 2014 congressional elections were a month prior to {{the announcement of the}} thaw.|$|R
2500|$|Burris {{filed an}} {{affidavit}} with the Illinois House committee that oversaw Governor Blagojevich's impeachment, dated February 5, to supplement his earlier {{answer to a}} question posed by the committee. Burris acknowledged Rob Blagojevich requested [...] "assistance in fund-raising" [...] for the governor three times {{in the weeks and months}} before Blagojevich appointed Burris. Burris said he told Rob Blagojevich that he could not donate to Gov. Blagojevich because [...] "it could be viewed as an attempt to curry favor with him regarding his decision to appoint a successor to President Obama." [...] Burris stated that he neither donated to nor raised funds for Blagojevich after a fund-raiser on June 27, 2008. Saying that this is at odds with Burris' testimony during the impeachment trial, Illinois House <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they would consider pursuing a perjury investigation. Democratic officials, including Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan, supported that announcement.|$|E
2500|$|The party {{coalesced}} around Jefferson, who diligently maintained extensive {{correspondence with}} like-minded Republican leaders throughout the country. Washington frequently decried the {{growing sense of}} [...] "party" [...] emerging from the internal battles among Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton, Adams and others in his administration. As warfare in Europe increased, the two factions increasingly made foreign policy the central political issue of the day. The Republicans wanted to maintain the 1778 alliance with France, which had overthrown the monarchy and aristocracy and become a republic. Even though Britain was by far United States' leading trading partner, Republicans feared that increased trade would undermine republicanism. The Republicans distrusted Hamilton's national bank and rejected his premise that a national debt {{was good for the}} country as <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they were both forms of corruption. They strongly distrusted the elitism of Hamilton's circle, denouncing it as [...] "aristocratic"; and they called for states' rights lest the Federalists centralize ever more power in the national governments. The intense debate over the Jay Treaty in 1794–1795 transformed those opposed to Hamilton's policies from a loose movement into a true political party. To fight the treaty, the Jeffersonians [...] "established coordination in activity between leaders at the capital, and leaders, actives and popular followings in the states, counties and towns". However, they were defeated when Washington mobilized public opinion in favor of the treaty.|$|E
60|$|The Democrats said {{protection}} {{was killing}} the farmers; the <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> no. The Grangers growled about the middle-men; the Greenbackers said there wasn't circulating medium enough, and, {{in the midst}} of it all, hard-working, discouraged farmers, like Simeon Burns, worked on, unable to find out what really was the matter.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, Horner {{announced}} that he would run for Governor, seeking the endorsement of the Independence Party. Horner, who had previously identified as a <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> he was running because both the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL) and Republican candidates had become too extreme in their views. Horner was endorsed by his former boss, Durenberger, as well as former congressman and gubernatorial candidate Tim Penny.|$|R
5000|$|Ermey, {{an outspoken}} <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> in an {{interview}} earlier in 2015 that he supported Texas Senator Ted Cruz for President. He said, [...] "You know what, I just watched Ted Cruz [...] I mean, what a tough act to follow. I'm {{not going to tell}} you who I'm going to vote for, but I'm going to let you guess ... and the first two guesses don't count!" ...|$|R
50|$|In 1982 the {{conviction}} of Richard Kelly was overturned {{on the grounds of}} entrapment. Kelly, the sole <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> that he was only pretending to be involved with the bribery from Abdul Enterprises. He claimed that he was conducting his own operation dealing with corruption and that the FBI was ruining his own investigation. However, an appeals court upheld {{the conviction}} and Kelly served 13 months in prison.|$|R
50|$|Tea Party Republicans {{were the}} only group that said funding for the health care law should be cut off even if it led to a shutdown. A Pew poll found that 71% of Tea Party <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> lawmakers who shared their views should stand by their {{principles}} and refuse to compromise in budget negotiations even if {{that would lead to}} a shutdown (compared to 18% of Democrats, 36% of independents, and 49% of Republicans overall). In a CNBC poll, 54% of Tea Party <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they wanted the Affordable Care Act defunded even if it meant a government shutdown.|$|E
50|$|In May 2017, Congress {{approved}} a {{budget for the}} balance of the 2017-18 fiscal year which cuts EPA funding by only 1% and does not cut staffing or any specific programs. <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> they expect make much larger cuts in the 2018-19 budget.|$|E
50|$|Kerry {{was criticized}} by some Democrats for having pursued {{his own party}} members, {{including}} former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford, although <b>Republicans</b> <b>said</b> he should have pressed against some Democrats even harder. The BCCI scandal was later {{turned over to the}} Manhattan District Attorney's office.|$|E
5000|$|Brown {{said that}} [...] "we will {{go all the}} way to the United States Supreme Court, dealing with making sure that African Americans are not disenfranchised." [...] Florida House Redistricting Chairman Richard Corcoran, a <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "consideration of {{political}} data is legally required" [...] to ensure that district boundaries would not be so shifted as to not allow African-Americans a chance to elect representatives of their choice.|$|R
5000|$|Congressman White, an African-American <b>Republican,</b> <b>said</b> after {{passage of}} this constitution, [...] "I cannot live in North Carolina {{and be a}} man and {{be treated as a}} man."

5000|$|In June 2011, the Chairman and a {{subcommittee}} {{chairman of}} the House Energy and Commerce Committee, both <b>Republicans,</b> <b>said</b> that the FCC, in response to their requests, had set a target date of August 2011 for removing the Fairness Doctrine and other [...] "outdated" [...] regulations from the FCC's rulebook.|$|E
50|$|A Rasmussen Reports poll {{conducted}} in April 2012 showed 44% of likely U.S. voters held {{at least a}} somewhat favorable view of Tea Party activists, while 49% share an unfavorable opinion of them.
