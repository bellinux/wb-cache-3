5000|$|In around 1841, {{he invented}} the detonating <b>railway</b> <b>fog</b> <b>signal,</b> first tried on the Croydon railway and widely {{used to this}} day as an {{emergency}} safety measure. The same year, he joined Fox, Henderson and Co, structural and railway engineers in Smethwick, where he devised a method of casting railway chairs. He oversaw the company’s contract drawings for the 1851 Exhibition Building, The Crystal Palace.|$|E
5000|$|A {{bell was}} {{established}} at Roche's Point in 1864 to warn mariners in poor visibility. [...] This {{was replaced by}} a siren <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> on 1 December 1898. [...] The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> changed again in 1949 when a diaphone was installed with a character of one two-second blast every thirty seconds. [...] In 1995 when the lighthouse was automated an electric <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> (ELG 300-04) replaced the diaphone. [...] This electric <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was connected to a fog detector which activated the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> if visibility fell below three nautical miles. The electric <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> had a range of four nautical miles. On 11 January 2011 the Commissioners of Irish Lights, despite much opposition, discontinued all Irish <b>fog</b> <b>signals.</b> [...] This brought an end to a long era of <b>fog</b> <b>signaling</b> at Roche's Point.|$|R
2500|$|Buildings at the lightstation {{included}} {{the tower and}} dwelling, <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> building, boat house, barn, three oil houses, two privy's and a Diaphone <b>fog</b> <b>signal.</b> [...] The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> building fell into the lake due to erosion in 1943.|$|R
50|$|The Manana Island Sound Signal Station is {{an active}} <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> station on Manana Island, Maine, United States. Established in 1855, {{it is one of}} the only {{separately}} managed <b>fog</b> <b>signals</b> in the United States, having been operationally independent of Monhegan Island Light for most of its existence. It is also home to the only known <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> trumpet tower, built in 1889. The station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Manana Island <b>Fog</b> <b>Signal</b> Station in 2002.|$|R

40|$|To {{solve the}} problem that dynamic Allan {{variance}} (DAVAR) with fixed length of window cannot meet the identification accuracy requirement of fiber optic gyro (<b>FOG)</b> <b>signal</b> over all time domains, a dynamic Allan variance analysis method with time-variant window length based on fuzzy control is proposed. According to the characteristic of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal,</b> a fuzzy controller with the inputs {{of the first and}} second derivatives of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> is designed to estimate the window length of the DAVAR. Then the Allan variances of the signals during the time-variant window are simulated to obtain the DAVAR of the <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> to describe the dynamic characteristic of the time-varying <b>FOG</b> <b>signal.</b> Additionally, a performance evaluation index of the algorithm based on radar chart is proposed. Experiment results show that, compared with different fixed window lengths DAVAR methods, the change of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> with time can be identified effectively and the evaluation index of performance can be enhanced by 30 % at least by the DAVAR method with time-variant window length based on fuzzy control...|$|R
50|$|The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was {{discontinued}} in 1987, and the detached building which {{housed the}} <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> equipment now stands {{very close to}} the edge of the cliff. It used to sound two blasts every 45 seconds.|$|R
5000|$|A {{fog bell}} was {{installed}} in 1858, and the lightkeepers house was rebuilt in 1868. [...] A steam-powered fog horn was added in 1871, and a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> building sheltering the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> apparatus was constructed in 1892.|$|R
50|$|In the 1950s, the {{lighthouse}} station was electrified and the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> {{was replaced with}} a powerful Diaphone. The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was closed as a navigational aid in 1988, {{but it is still}} operational and is used on special occasions.|$|R
50|$|Operations {{commenced}} in 1893 {{with the}} construction of a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> building and a two-story keeper's quarters. The station’s first light was a lens lantern displayed from a post located close to the point. A steam-powered Daboll trumpet served as the <b>fog</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{technology}} made light {{a secondary}} warning system, and a radio beacon became the primary method of warning ships. Starting in 1978, {{the light was}} operated only in poor visibility, along with the <b>fog</b> <b>signal.</b> The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was finally discontinued in 1995.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{extensively}} modified in a refit in 1927 at Öregrunds Ship och Varvs AB, {{the original}} paraffin light being replaced with an AGA beacon. The fog bell was augmented with a [...] "nautophone" [...] <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> and an underwater <b>fog</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R

50|$|Elizabeth II {{visited the}} {{lighthouse}} in 1956, {{with the young}} Duke of Cornwall and the Princess Anne. The seven-year-old {{heir to the throne}} sounded the first blast on a new fog siren. The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was operated by compressed air supplied from a compressor, driven by a Kelvin Diesel engine. There were three Kelvin engines and compressors, and when the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was in operation, two of them were in service to maintain the required air pressure with one standby, in rotation. In 1984, the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was discontinued and the fog horn building was demolished.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—According {{to the bad}} {{influence}} of fiber optic gyro(FOG) signal random drift in inertia stabilized platform system, {{the properties of the}} <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> random drift are detected with the Allan variance method. By the relation between the Allan variance of signal noise and power spectrum density (PSD), the sources of some kinds of noise and its properties are analyzed and calculated using fitting algorithm in the least square method (LSM). The result of testing and statistic analyzing for <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> indicate that the Allan variance means is successful in separating and estimating the main random error source of <b>FOG</b> <b>signal</b> noise...|$|R

50|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century it was decided that a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was {{required}} in the area of Malin Head. It was decided that it would be constructed at the west end of the island and came into operation in 1905. There were, therefore, two separate establishments on the island. In 1952 the Commissioners of Irish Lights decided to update the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> the lighthouse. It was decided {{that the best way to}} do so would be to build a new lighthouse beside the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> station at the west end of the island and to discontinue the lighthouse at the east end.|$|R
5000|$|In 1889, the United States Lighthouse Board {{realized}} that Mackinaw Point {{was a better}} location. Their first inclination was to put a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> there, but when asking Congress for funding, they requested funding for both a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> and a first class lighthouse. Congress chose to accept their recommendation, but only voted the funding for a steam-powered fog-signal. The <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> was built in 1890. [...] The signal proved to be exceptionally necessary for navigation in the often fog-choked Straits of Mackinac; during one exceptionally humid fortnight, the Old Mackinac Point signal personnel reported burning 52 cords of stove wood {{in order to keep}} steam up for the foghorn.|$|R

A number of these stations were constructed along the California coast, although few survive in their original form today.|$|R
5000|$|The Middle Island Light {{consists}} of three structures: a double keeper's house, a <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> building, and the light itself. All structures are constructed of brick on a stone foundation. The tower is built 375 ft away from the keeper's house, with the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> 265 ft {{on the other side}} of the house. [...] Cement walkways link the three buildings.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Fog</b> <b>signals</b> have {{received}} much attention at Point Betsie. In {{the autumn of}} 1912, the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> building was rebuilt. The 10 in locomotive whistles were replaced by 10 inch chime whistles. Meanwhile, the lamp was upgraded to an incandescent oil vapor system, with an intensity of 55,000 candlepower. In 1921, upon being connected to the electrical power grid, aa 110-volt electric bulb was installed, and the <b>fog</b> <b>signal</b> upgraded to twin Type [...] "G" [...] diaphones, driven by electric air compressors. The diaphone doubled the audible radius, and had the added benefit {{that it could be}} brought on line immediately, without waiting for steam engines to build pressure. The following April the <b>fog</b> <b>signal's</b> characteristic was changed to a group of two blasts every 30 seconds. [...] Dismantled and sold as junk to the local residents in the 1970s, who hauled it away, all original fog horn apparatus has long since disappeared and is no longer on site.|$|R
