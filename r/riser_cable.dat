40|$|This thesis {{provides}} in-depth {{information on}} the high speed optical transport requirements for the Square Kilometre Array. The stringent data rates as well as timing and synchronization requirements are dealt {{with respect to the}} optical fibre technology. Regarding the data transport, we draw a clear comparison between a typical telecommunication access network and a telescope network. Invoking simulations and experiments on the field and laboratory test bed, we successfully implement a suitable telescope network using vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) technology. Polarization effects on the KAT- 7 telescope network, an operational prototype for the SKA is studied so as to estimate the expected effect in the MeerKAT telescope with transmission distances _ 12 km. The study further relates the obtained values to the expected impact on the distribution of the time and frequency reference in the MeerKAT array. Clock stability depends on the differential group delay (DGD) and polarization stability. On a 10 : 25 km link that includes the <b>riser</b> <b>cable</b> a DGD of 62 : 1 fs was attained. This corresponds to a polarization mode dispersion (PMD) coefficient of 19 : 4 fs=km 1 = 2. This is a low PMD value considering telecommunication network. The PMD value is within the allowed budget in the telescope network. However, {{this may not be the}} case at longer baselines extending to over 1000 km as expected in SKA 2. The fibre's deployment contribution to the DGD is measured by comparing the deployed fibre to the undeployed of equal lengths. On the 10 : 25 km deployed single mode fibre, the maximum and mean DGDs measured were 217 : 7 fs and 84 : 8 fs respectively. The undeployed fibre of similar type and equal length, gave a maximum and minimum DGDs of 58 : 6 fs and 36 : 3 fs respectively. The deployment is seen to increase the maximum and minimum DGDs by factors of 3. 7 and 2. 3 respectively. This implies that fibre deployment is very critical in ensuring the birefringence is minimized. Polarization fluctuation recorded a maximum of 180 o during the 15 hour real time astronomer use of the antenna. To ascertain the contribution of the <b>riser</b> <b>cable,</b> state of polarization (SOP) of the buried section of the single mode fibre in the link was established. A maximum SOP change of 14 o over 15 hour monitoring was measured. From the stability realized on the buried section of the fibre, the change in polarization is contributed by the <b>riser</b> <b>cable.</b> The fluctuation in polarization can cause the phase of a clock signal to drift between the birefringent axes by an equal amount corresponding to DGD. We experimentally demonstrate how polarization stabilization can be attained using the polarization maintaining fibre. We also demonstrate the applicability of VCSEL technology in the SKA unidirectional data flow especially for shorter baselines < 100 km. The VCSEL is a low cost light source with attractive advantages such as low power consumption, high speed capabilities and wavelength tuneability. This work entails the use of traditional amplitude modulation commonly known as non-return-to-zero (NRZ) on-off keying (OOK) because of its simplicity and cost. For the MeerKAT typical distances, we show that even in a worst case scenario, the use of VCSEL on different fibres in MeerKAT distance is achievable. Using the impairment reduction approach, we successfully manage to achieve transmission distance beyond MeerKAT. Several in-line dispersion compensation mechanisms in telecommunication have been successfully employed. The work focused on the use of negative dispersion fibre to mitigate the chromatic dispersion effects in the optical fibre. The inverse dispersion fibre (IDF) is proposed for compensation in the conventional zero dispersion wavelength fibres, G. 652 that are used at the third window. Similarly, the chromatic dispersion compensation of non-zero dispersion shifted fibre (NZDSF) is experimentally demonstrated using negative dispersion submarine reduced slope (SRS), G. 655 (-). With dispersion management, we demonstrate how transmissions beyond MeerKAT baselines can be achieved error free. A systematic investigation of the use of distributed Raman amplification to overcome the attenuation losses is provided. High on-off gains of up to 15 dB, 8 dB and 5 dB for bidirectional, forward and backward pumping respectively is achieved on a 25 km Raman optimized NZDSF-Reach fibre. Combined dispersion mitigation technique and low noise distributed Raman amplification, up to about 80 km transmission was achieved on a 4 : 25 Gbps modulated VCSEL using a single pump. Using bidirectional pumping, more than 100 km of transmission was achieved error free. The high gains enhance the VCSEL transmission distance. We further suggest a novel way of using the Raman pump to distribute the clock signal while amplifying the data signal streaming the astronomical data from the remote placed telescope receivers. In summary, the work presented in this thesis has demonstrated the potential use of VCSEL technology for data collection in the telescope array. We have studied the optical effects and mitigation so as to improve the clock and data transmission. This work is relevant and valuable in providing SKA with VCSELs, an option for extremely high network performance at reasonable costs...|$|E

Service providers that are awarded contracts under the program are allowed to compete for GSA's FTS 2001 long distance service contracts, so that federal agencies may potentially acquire end-to-end local and long distance telecommunications services from one source. Only five of the 19 metropolitan areas that were scheduled to switch from existing services to MAA services by or before March 2002 have done so.

40|$|International audienceWe {{consider}} {{here the}} dynamics of flexible slender systems undergoing vortex-induced vibration (VIV). This type of motion results from the coupling between the oscillating wake due to cross-flow and the structure motion. Practical applications are mainly found {{in the field of}} ocean engineering, where long flexible structures such as <b>risers</b> or mooring <b>cables</b> are excited by sea currents. The wake dynamics is here represented using a distributed wake oscillator coupled to {{the dynamics of}} the slender structure, a cable or a tensioned beam. This results in two coupled partial differential equations with one variable for the solid displacement and one for the wake fluctuating lift. This simplified model of the wake dynamics has been previously validated on simple experiments. Here, comparisons with direct numerical simulation results are done for both uniform and non-uniform flow. Comparison is also performed between the wake oscillator predictions and some experimental results on long cables. The results of those comparisons show that the proposed method can be used as simple computational tool in the prediction of some aspects of vortex induced vibrations of long flexible structures. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Flow-structure {{interaction}} is a generic problem for many engineering applications, such as flow [...] induced oscillations of marine <b>risers</b> and <b>cables.</b> In this thesis a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) approach based on spectral/hp elements is employed. Structural motion implies {{changes on the}} boundaries of the flow domain. An Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) scheme is incorporated to efficiently move the mesh without remeshing. Efficient three-dimensional simulations with periodicity in at least one space direction are achieved using Hybrid Fourier-Jacobi expansions. Both 2 D and 3 D formulations can treat an arbitrary number of oscillating bodies. Due to the large computational demands of the resulting systems parallel computing is used with MPI. Numerical experiments are run and systematic data sets are obtained for flow around two cylinders. Stationary cylinders in tandem and side-by-side arrangements are examined parametrically over spacing and Reynolds number. Parametric studies of tandem cylinders in prescribed motion and free oscillation are also conducted. For tandem cylinders, sudden changes in the forces occur at a critical spacing where a transition from reattachment to binary vortex regime occurs. (cont.) A hysteresis effect is observed for spacings near the nominal critical, where for given Reynolds number there are two possible solutions depending on the initial conditions. Discrepancies in the prediction of the critical spacing using 2 D and 3 D simulations are identified and explained. The three-dimensional effects are found to cause a weakening of the strength of the primary vortices and a delay in the inception to) binary vortex regime. When the cylinders oscillate in prescribed motion, the phase angle of the oscillations can alter significantly the hydrodynamic work on the downstream cylinder. For spacings smaller than the critical spacing, the lock-on range of frequencies is wider than that of a single cylinder. As the oscillations amplitude increases however, pockets of non-lock-on regions are found within the Arnold synchronization regions. A shift towards higher frequencies in the synchronization range is found for the in-phase oscillations compared to the anti-phase oscillations. A consistent change is found in the spanwise correlations. For the elastically mounted two-degree of freedom tandem cylinders it is found that the synchronization range of the upstream cylinder is wider when its latest shed pair of vortices intercepts the downstream cylinder. (cont.) A shifting of the synchronization curve on the reduced velocity axis is observed and explained in terms of the natural shedding frequency of the corresponding stationary system of cylinders. by Georgios V.

40|$|Fluid-structure {{interaction}} (FSI) is {{an important}} physical phenomenon in many applications and across various disciplines including aerospace, civil and bio-engineering. In civil engineering, applications include the design of wind turbines, pipelines, suspension bridges and offshore platforms. Ocean structures such as drilling <b>risers,</b> mooring lines, <b>cables,</b> undersea piping and tension-leg platforms can be subject to strong ocean currents, and such structures may suffer from Vortex-Induced Vibrations (VIV's), where vortex shedding of the flow interacts with the structural properties, leading to large amplitude vibrations in both in-line and cross-flow directions. Over the past years, many experimental and numerical {{studies have been conducted}} to comprehend the underlying physical mechanisms. However, to date there is still limited understanding of the effect of oscillatory interactions between fluid flow and structural behavior though such interactions can cause large deformations. This research proposes a mathematical framework to accurately predict FSI for elastically supported rigid structures. The numerical method developed solves the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations for the fluid and the Equation of Motion (EOM) for the structure. The proposed method employs Finite Differences (FD) on Cartesian grids together with an improved, efficient and oscillation-free Immersed Boundary Method (IBM), the accuracy of which is verified for several test cases of increasing complexity. A variety of two and three dimensional FSI simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and applicability of the method. In particular, forced and a free vibration of a rigid cylinder including Vortex-Induced Vibration (VIV) of an elastically supported cylinder are presented and compared with reference simulations and experiments. Then, the interference between two cylinders in tandem arrangement at two different spacing is investigated. In terms of VIV, three different scenarios were studied for each cylinder arrangement to compare resonance regime to a single cylinder. Finally, the IBM is implemented into a three-dimensional Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) method and two high Reynolds number (Re) flows are studied for a stationary and transversely oscillating cylinder. The robustness, accuracy and applicability of the method for high Re number flow is demonstrated by comparing the turbulence statistics of the two cases and discussing differences in the mean and instantaneous flows.
