40|$|AbstractIn {{the absence}} of crystallographic data, the {{mechanism}} of nitrogen transfer from glutamine in asparagine synthetase (AS) remains under active investigation. Surprisingly, the glutamine-dependent AS from Escherichia coli (AsnB) appears to lack a conserved histidine residue, necessary for nitrogen transfer if the reaction proceeds by the accepted pathway in other glutamine amidotransferases, but retains ability to synthesize asparagine. We propose an alternative mechanism for nitrogen transfer in AsnB which obviates the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> <b>participation</b> of histidine in this step.

Second, the country must be sufficiently poor to qualify for loans from the World Bank's International Development Association or the IMF's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF, the successor to ESAF), which provide long-term, interest-free loans to the world's poorest nations. Lastly, the country must establish a track record of reforms to help prevent future debt crises.|$|E

The presence of private systems serves as a check on the ability of a monetary authority to tighten monetary policy.

With this criterion the DFL tries to ascertain that all clubs remain solvent during the season in order to be able to maintain the club operations for as long as possible. The DFL can refuse to issue a license if a club does not meet these requirements.|$|E

Judicial procedures are influenced by local authorities and traditions and the supply of trained jurists is very limited.
