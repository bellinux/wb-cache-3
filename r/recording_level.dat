The chord was made to ring out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out.

25|$|Stereo {{recorders}} eventually {{evolved into}} high fidelity and {{were known as}} cassette decks, after the reel-to-reel decks. Hi-Fi cassette decks, in contrast to cassette recorders and cassette players, often didn't have built-in amplification or speakers. Many formats of cassette players and recorders have evolved over the years. Initially all were top loading, usually with cassette on one side, and VU meters and <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> controls on the other side. Older models used combinations of levers and sliding buttons for control.|$|E
2500|$|In {{better quality}} old-fashioned tube radio sets, a tuning guide {{consisting}} of a phosphor tube was used to aid the tuning adjustment. This was {{also known as a}} [...] "Magic Eye" [...] or [...] "Tuning Eye". Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device. The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.|$|E

2500|$|Since CDs {{were not}} the primary medium for popular music until the late 1980s, there was little {{motivation}} for competitive loudness practices then. The common practice of mastering music for CD involved matching the highest peak of a recording at, or close to, digital full scale, and referring to digital levels {{along the lines of}} more familiar analog VU meters. When using VU meters, a certain point (usually −14dB below the disc's maximum amplitude) was used {{in the same way as}} the saturation point (signified as 0dB) of analog recording, with several dB of the CD's <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> reserved for amplitude exceeding the saturation point (often referred to as the [...] "red zone", signified by a red bar in the meter display), because digital media cannot exceed 0decibels relative to full scale (dBFS). The average level of the average rock song during most of the decade was around −16.8dBFS.|$|E

50|$|An {{audio tape}} generates {{a certain amount}} of noise. If the level of the signal on the tape is low, the noise is more prominent, i.e., the {{signal-to-noise}} ratio is lower than it could be. To produce the least noisy recording, the <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> should be set as high as possible without being so high as to clip or distort the signal. In professional high-fidelity recording the level is set manually using a peak-reading meter. When high fidelity is not a requirement, a suitable <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> can be set by an AGC circuit which reduces the gain as the average signal level increases. This allows a usable recording to be made even for speech some distance from the microphone of an audio recorder. Similar considerations apply with VCRs.|$|E

5000|$|Bang & Olufsen {{developed}} the HX Pro headroom extension system {{in conjunction with}} Dolby Laboratories in 1982. This was used in many higher-end decks. HX Pro reduces the high-frequency bias during recording when the signal being recorded has {{a high level of}} high frequency content. Such a signal is self-biasing. Reducing the level of the bias signal permits the desired signal to be recorded at a higher level without saturating the tape, thus increasing [...] "headroom" [...] or maximum <b>recording</b> <b>level.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 12-inch singles {{typically}} have much shorter playing time than full-length LPs, thus require fewer grooves per inch. This extra space permits a broader dynamic range or louder <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> as the grooves' excursions (i.e., {{the width of}} the groove waves and distance traveled from side to side by the turntable stylus) can be much greater in amplitude, especially in the bass frequencies so important for dance music.

5000|$|High quality open-reel {{machines}} {{can extend}} from 10 Hz to above 20 kHz. The linearity {{of the response}} may be indicated by providing information {{on the level of}} the response relative to a reference frequency. For example, a system component may have a response given as 20 Hz to 20 kHz +/- 3 dB relative to 1 kHz. Some analog tape manufacturers specify frequency responses up to 20 kHz, but these measurements may have been made at lower signal levels. Compact cassettes may have a response extending up to 15 kHz at full (0 dB) <b>recording</b> <b>level.</b> [...] At lower levels usually -10 dB, cassettes typically rolls-off at around 20 kHz for most machines, {{due to the nature of}} the tape media caused by self-erasure (which worsens the linearity of the response).|$|E

5000|$|The {{signal to}} noise ratio is simply how large the music signal is {{compared}} to the low level of the [...] "noise" [...] with no signal. When the music is loud, the low hiss is not noticeable, but when the music is soft or in silence, most of what can be heard is the noise. If the <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> is adjusted so that the music is always loud, then it could in theory be turned down later, and the noise volume would also be turned down. The idea is for electronics to automatically increase the recording volume when it is soft, but reduce the volume on playback. Some schemes like Dolby B concentrate only on the high frequencies so that the [...] "hiss" [...] sound of noise will be masked when volume is turned down for playback.|$|E
50|$|The {{sound quality}} of Hi-Fi VHS stereo is {{comparable}} to the quality of CD audio, particularly when recordings were made on high-end or professional VHS machines that have a manual audio <b>recording</b> <b>level</b> control. This high quality compared to other consumer audio recording formats such as compact cassette attracted the attention of amateur and hobbyist recording artists. Home recording enthusiasts occasionally recorded high quality stereo mixdowns and master recordings from multitrack audio tape onto consumer-level Hi-Fi VCRs. However, because the VHS Hi-Fi recording process is intertwined with the VCR's video-recording function, advanced editing functions such as audio-only or video-only dubbing are impossible. A short-lived alternative to the hifi feature for recording mixdowns of hobbyist audio-only projects was a PCM adaptor so that high-bandwidth digital video could use a grid of black-and-white dots on an analog video carrier to give pro-grade digital sounds though DAT tapes made this obsolete.|$|E
