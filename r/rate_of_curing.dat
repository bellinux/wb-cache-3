50|$|Whilst some epoxy resin/ {{hardener}} combinations will cure at ambient temperature, many require heat, {{with temperatures}} up to 150 °C being common, {{and up to}} 200 °C for some specialist systems.

Cure temperature should typically attain the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the fully cured network in order to achieve maximum properties.

40|$|Propagation of {{the yeast}} prion [PSI+], a {{self-replicating}} aggregated form of Sup 35 p, requires Hsp 104. One model {{to explain this}} phenomenon proposes that, {{in the absence of}} Hsp 104, Sup 35 p aggregates enlarge but fail to replicate thus becoming diluted out as the yeast divide. To test this model, we used live imaging of Sup 35 p-GFP to follow the changes that occur in [PSI+] cells after the addition of guanidine to inactivate Hsp 104. After guanidine addition there was initially an increase in aggregation of Sup 35 p-GFP; but then, before the yeast divided, the aggregates began to dissolve, and after ≈ 6 h the Sup 35 -GFP looked identical to the Sup 35 -GFP in [psi+] cells. Although plating studies showed that the yeast were still [PSI+], this reduction in aggregation suggested that curing of [PSI+] by inactivation of Hsp 104 might be independent of cell division. This was tested by measuring the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> of [PSI+] cells in both dividing and nondividing cells. Cell division was inhibited by adding either alpha factor or farnesol. Remarkably, with both of these methods, we found that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> was not significantly affected by cell division. Thus, cell division is not a determining factor for curing [PSI+] by inactivating Hsp 104 with guanidine. Rather, curing apparently occurs because Sup 35 -GFP polymers slowly depolymerize in the absence of Hsp 104 activity. Hsp 104 then counteracts this curing possibly by catalyzing formation of new polymers...|$|E

The cure process of epoxy resin–organo-montmorillonite (Org-MMT) – 2 -ethyl- 4 -methylimidazole (2, 4 -EMI) nanocomposite with different Org-MMT loadings was in situ monitored with a technique of dynamic torsional vibration method (DTVM) in the isothermal mode.

40|$|A slow <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>curing</b> and {{the long}} time {{necessary}} to achieve full strength has led cold asphalt mixes (CAM) to be considered poorer in comparison to hot mix asphalt over the last decades. This piece of research aimed {{to develop a new}} fast-curing and environmentally friendly cold asphalt concrete for binder courses mixture (CACB). It has the same gradation as that of traditional hot asphalt concrete mixtures but incorporates a binary blended cementitious filler (BBCF) containing waste, high calcium fly ash (HCFA) and fluid catalytic cracking catalyst residue (FC 3 R) activated by a waste alkaline NaOH solution. The research concludes that incorporating an alkali activated binary blended cementitious filler (ABBCF) with CACB significantly improves the mechanical properties and water susceptibility. In addition, the high performance ABBCF mixture has a substantial lower thermal sensitivity than traditional hot asphalt concrete binder course mixtures.
