5|$|The Chhera Pahara (sweeping with water) is a {{significant}} ritual associated with the Ratha Yatra. During this ritual, the Gajapati King wears the outfit of a sweeper and sweeps all around the deities and chariots. The king cleans the <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the chariots with a gold-handled broom and sprinkles sandalwood water and powder. As per the custom, although the Gajapati King has been considered the most exalted person in the Kalingan kingdom, he still renders the menial service to Jagannatha. This ritual signifies that under the lordship of Jagannatha, there is no distinction between the powerful sovereign and the humblest devotee.|$|E

The Potts stay overnight in a hotel in Calais. While the family sleeps, the gangsters break into the children's room and kidnap them and drive off towards Paris. Chitty tracks the gangsters' route, wakes Commander and Mrs. Pott, and they drive off in pursuit.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{problems with the}} terminal building, both the airport's location and surrounding infrastructure were {{the subject of much}} complaint as well. For one, although some 1,700 cars visited the airport daily, the parking lot had only 129 slots, and could not be expanded any further. The airport complex likewise was located directly alongside major city thoroughfares, in particular the city's main highway, the Tomas Confesor Highway, which complicated the flow of traffic in and around the area. At one point, the ATO, which was already having difficulty managing vehicular traffic around the airport, proposed banning cargo and delivery trucks from passing through the <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of the terminal building. However, the city government did not respond.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{continued}} {{during the}} morning; however, by 12:00 the North Koreans finally withdrew, abandoning {{the bridge to}} the Australians. Meanwhile, Coad put two companies from the Argylls across the Taeryong River on tanks at the Pakchon ford, and they met only slight opposition. The Middlesex then passed through them, moving south-west onto the main <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of 3 RAR where they knocked out a North Korean tank which was blocking their advance. By nightfall they had linked up with the Australians, consolidating their positions and securing a safe crossing {{for the remainder of}} the brigade, including the wheeled vehicles which followed that evening. North Korean patrols attempted to harass the British and Australian outposts; however, despite their perimeter being shelled it proved to be a relatively quiet night for the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August, the Governor Murray {{constituted}} a general court-martial, {{presided over by}} Lt.-Col. Stephen Arthur Goodman. Despite the initial revolt passing largely peacefully with slave masters locked in their homes, those who were considered ringleaders were tried at set up at different estates along the coast and executed by shooting; their heads were cut off and nailed to posts. A variety of sentences were handed out, including solitary confinement, lashing, and death. Bryant (1824) records 72 slaves having been sentenced by court-martial {{at the time of}} publication. He noted that 19 of the 45 death sentences had been carried out; a further 18 slaves had been reprieved. Quamina was among those executed; their bodies were hung up in chains by the side of a public <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of their respective plantations and left to rot for months afterwards. Jack Gladstone was sold and deported to St Lucia; Da Costa suggests that a letter Sir John had sent on his behalf resulted in clemency.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{her arrival}} to Ramsay Street, Bridget makes friends with Zeke Kinski (Matthew Werkmeister) {{and she joins}} his {{football}} team, despite opposition from bully Justin Hunter (Chris Toohey). Bridget joins Declan Napier when he begins joyriding. During a race with Justin, they are pursued by the police. They return home thinking they escaped, {{only to find the}} police waiting for them. Bridget is banned from seeing Declan, but she sneaks out to meet him at the park, where they argue. On her way home, Bridget trips and falls into the <b>road</b> <b>in</b> <b>front</b> of a car being driven by Susan Kennedy. Susan blacks out, a result of suffering from multiple sclerosis, and hits Bridget. She drives off, unaware of what she has done. Bridget is found and rushed to the hospital, where she undergoes emergency surgery for a bleed on her brain. She remains unconscious, until Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) visits and pleads with her to wake up. Bridget's hand moves and she awakes the next day. However, she cannot feel anything down the left side of her body and she is told that she could be permanently disabled. Susan realises that she caused the accident and comes forward. She is arrested and put on trial. Bridget remembers that she fell into the road and that the accident was not Susan's fault, and she tells the court. During a rehabilitation class at the swimming pool, Bridget meets Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). Following a disastrous date with Declan, where Bridget is given the impression that Declan cannot handle her disability, Bridget begins dating Josh. Following a roof collapse at an illegal dance party, Bridget and Josh are both trapped in rubble. Declan carries Josh out before coming back for Bridget. Another collapse traps Declan and Bridget together and Declan tells her that he does not have a problem with her disability. Shortly after, Bridget begins to walk without her walking aid and her mobility returns.|$|E
