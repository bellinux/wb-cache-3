Surprisingly, we also find that higher <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> lead to fewer internal conflicts and that less democratic countries face not a higher but a lower likelihood of conflicts following an increase in <b>resource</b> <b>rents.</b> We argue that these findings {{can be explained by the}} ability of the political elites in less democratic countries to more effectively quell the masses through redistribution of rents to the public. We support our argument by documenting that higher <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> lead to more (less) government spending in less (more) democratic countries.

Following the 2010 hung parliament election result, the Labor Party elected to adopt the Australian Greens preference for a carbon tax to transition to an emissions trading scheme, establishing a carbon price via the Clean Energy Act 2011.

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> on the {{political}} equilibrium have been studied in two main types of models. The first tradition employs models of conflict, and studies how <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> affect the intensity and duration of civil conflict. The second tradition employs political economy models, where <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> affect the political equilibrium because {{the costs and benefits}} of buying votes change. Although providing much insight, a primary disadvantage of these two model traditions is that they have little to say about when democracy emerges, and about when conflict emerges. This question is simply determined by the type of model one chooses to study. Yet an important empirical literature suggests that a main effect of <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> may be exactly that it affects the political choice between democracy and civil conflict. In this paper, by integrating the earlier model traditions, we suggest the simplest possible framework we can think of to study this choice. The institutional outcome in our theory is consequently endogenous. We show how factors such as <b>resource</b> <b>rents,</b> the extent of electoral competition, and productivity affect economic and political equilibria, and discuss how our approach, mechanisms and results differ from the earlier theories. </p...|$|R
40|$|The general policy {{prescription}} for resource-rich countries is that, for sustainable consumption, {{a greater percentage}} of the windfall from <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> should be channelled into accumulating foreign assets such as a sovereign public fund as done in Norway and other developed but resource-rich countries. This might not be a correct policy {{prescription for}} resource-rich sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries, where public capital is very low to support the needed economic growth. In such countries, <b>rents</b> from <b>resources</b> serve as opportunity to scale-up the needed public capital. Using panel data for the period 1990 - 2013, we find in line with the scaling-up hypothesis that <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> significantly increase public investment in SSA and that this tends to depend on the quality of political institutions. We also find evidence of a positive effect of public investment on economic growth, which also depends on the level of <b>resource</b> <b>rents.</b> Using some of the components of public investment, such as health and education expenditure, we find a negative effect of <b>resource</b> <b>rents,</b> suggesting among other things that public spending of <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> is directed more to other infrastructure investments...|$|R

40|$|This paper proposes {{and tests}} a {{mechanism}} {{through which the}} natural resource curse can operate.

The theory is tested using micro-level data from public opinion surveys across 15 sub-Saharan countries, in addition to country-level data on natural <b>resource</b> <b>rents,</b> taxation and election proximity. It is found that an increase in natural <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> decreases perceived tax enforcement, which in turn reduces the demand for regular, open and honest elections. Results are robust to alternative specifications. A supplementary analysis reveals that, consistent with the two-period model proposed, the effects are more acute closer to national elections. The findings support political-economy explanations of how natural resources affect economies, in which <b>resource</b> <b>rents</b> are purported to influence the decisions of the political elite through increased returns to staying in power.

Empirical studies demonstrate that <b>rents</b> from natural <b>resources,</b> and in particular oil, are {{an important source of}} civil war.

We demonstrate that the associated increased cost of conflict may in fact promote social stability.

The chance of conflict and rent dissipation in our model is highest for intermediate levels of <b>resource</b> <b>rents,</b> where the government cannot make credible commitments to the opposition groups. ...|$|R
