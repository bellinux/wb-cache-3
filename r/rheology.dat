40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of {{rheological}} layering on post-seismic deformation using models of an elastic layer over a viscoelastic layer and a viscoelastic half-space. We extend a general linear viscoelastic theory we have previously proposed to models with two layers over a half-space, although we only consider univiscous Maxwell and biviscous Burgers <b>rheologies.</b> In layered viscoelastic models, there are multiple mechanical timescales of post-seismic deformation; however, not all of these timescales arise as distinct phases of post-seismic relaxation observed at the surface. The surface displacements in layered models with only univiscous, Maxwell viscoelastic <b>rheologies</b> always exhibit one exponential-like phase of relaxation. Layered models containing biviscous <b>rheologies</b> may produce multiple phases of relaxation, where the distinctness of the phases depends on the geometry and the contrast in strengths between the layers. Post-seismic displacements in models with biviscous <b>rheologies</b> can often be described by logarithmic functions...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decade, {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made toward understanding how plate tectonics is generated from mantle dynamics. A primary goal of plate-generation studies has been the development of models that allow the top cold thermal boundary layer of mantle convection, i. e. the lithosphere, to develop broad and strong plate-like segments separated by narrow, weak and rapidly deforming boundaries; ideally, such models also permit significant strike-slip (toroidal) motion, passive ridges (i. e. pulled rather than pried apart), and self-consistent initiation of subduction. A major outcome of work so far is that nearly all aspects of plate generation require lithospheric <b>rheologies</b> and shear-localizing feedback mechanisms that are considerably more exotic than <b>rheologies</b> typically used in simple fluid-dynamical models of mantle flow. The search for plate-generating behavior has taken us through investigations of the effects of shear weakening (‘stick-slip’) and viscoplastic <b>rheologies,</b> of melting at ridges and low-viscosity asthenospheres, and of grain-size dependent <b>rheologies</b> and damage mechanics. Many such mechanisms, either by themselves or in combination, have led to self-consistent fluid-mechanical models of mantle flow that are remarkably plate-like, which is in itself a major accomplishment. However, many other important problems remain unsolved, such as subduction intiation and asymmetry, temporal evolution of plate geometry, rapid changes in plate motion, and the Archaean initiation of the plate-tectonic mode of convection. This paper presents a brief review of progress made in the plate-generation problem over the last decade, and discusses unresolved issues and future directions of research in this important area...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{representation}} of polynyas in viscous-plastic dynamic-thermodynamic sea-ice models is studied in a sim-plified test domain, {{in order to}} give recommendations about parametrisation choices. Bjornsson et al. (2001) validated their dynamic-thermodynamic model against a polynya flux model in a similar setup and we expand on that work here, testing more sea-ice <b>rheologies</b> and new-ice thickness formulations. The two additional <b>rheologies</b> tested give nearly identical results whereas the two new-ice thickness parametrisations tested give widely different results. Based on our results we argue for using the new-ice thickness parametrisation of Hibler (1979). We also implement a new parametrisation for the parameter h 0 from Hibler’s scheme, based on ideas from a collection depth parametrisation for flux polynya models. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model of localized, aseismic fault creep during the full interseismic period, {{including}} both transient and steady fault creep, {{in response to a}} sequence of imposed coseismic slip events and tectonic loading. We consider the behavior of models with lin-ear viscous, non-linear viscous, hot friction (i. e., rate-dependent friction), and rate-state friction fault <b>rheologies.</b> Both the transient postseismic creep and the pattern of steady interseismic creep rates surrounding asperities depend on recent coseismic slip and fault <b>rheologies.</b> In these models, postseismic fault creep is manifest as pulses of elevated creep rates that propagate from the coseismic slip, these pulses feature sharper fronts and are longer lived in models with rate-state friction compared to other models. With small char-acteristic slip distances in rate-state friction models, interseismic creep is similar to that in models with hot friction faults, except for the earliest periods of postseismic creep. Our model can be used to constrain fault <b>rheologies</b> from geodetic observations in cases where the coseismic slip history is relatively well-known. When only considering surface deformation over a short period of time, there are strong trade-offs between fault rheol-ogy and the details of the imposed coseismic slip.

25|$|The mantle differs {{substantially}} {{from the}} crust in its mechanical properties as the direct {{consequence of the}} difference in composition (expressed as different mineralogy). The distinction between crust and mantle is based on chemistry, rock types, <b>rheology</b> and seismic characteristics. The crust is a solidification product of mantle derived melts, expressed as various degrees of partial melting products during geologic time. Partial melting of mantle material is believed to cause incompatible elements to separate from the mantle, with less dense material floating upward through pore spaces, cracks, or fissures, that would subsequently cool and solidify at the surface. Typical mantle rocks have a higher magnesium to iron ratio and a smaller proportion of silicon and aluminium than the crust. This behavior is also predicted by experiments that partly melt rocks thought to be representative of Earth's mantle.|$|E

30|$|The {{determination}} of the relative contributions of the afterslip and viscoelastic relaxations to the postseismic deformation of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake was the primary objective of this study. Although this {{is very difficult to}} achieve, we attempted to determine the possible relationships between the respective mechanisms of the afterslip and viscoelastic relaxations and the exp and log decay functions of our model. Scholz (1990), Marone et al. (1991), and Scholz (1998) all proposed that the afterslip increases logarithmically with time. Freed et al. (2007) and Gahalaut et al. (2008) also used a logarithmic function to fit GPS displacement time series. Furthermore, the postseismic surface deformations determined by Maxwell viscoelastic <b>rheologies</b> exhibited an exponential-like relaxation phase (Hetland and Hager 2006). Moreover, postseismic displacements calculated by models with biviscous Burgers <b>rheologies</b> are often described by logarithmic functions (Hetland and Hager 2006). Hoechner et al.

The model results are consistent with satellite remote sensing data and discussed in terms of variability and trends of Arctic sea ice leads.
