However, Cu, which acts as cathode enhance formation of rust Fe 2 O 3 ·xH 2 O during fabrication. To prevent formation of Fe 2 O 3 ·xH 2 O <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> oils {{are widely used}}. High viscosity of those <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> oils decrease workability. While, low viscosity degrade <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> performance.

40|$|Abstract Since Fe-Cu-C {{sintered}} steels {{are easily}} rusted, they are coated with <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> oils. High viscosity of those <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> oils decrease workability, and low viscosity deteriorates <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> performance. Therefore, {{it is necessary}} to develop new <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> oils with contradictory properties of low viscosity and superior rust prevention. However, precise methodology to evaluate rust prevention ability has not been established. In this study, we developed new technique to quantitatively evaluate rust prevention ability by measuring the open circuit potential through thin corrosive solution on Fe-Cu-C sintered steels coated with a <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> oils. As a result, the ability for rust prevention can be measured quantitatively, and it decreases slowly over time, with repeating destruction and restoration. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} deteriorating processes of rust prevention ability for rust prevention oils are composed of three characteristics steps respectively. That is, in the first step the great open circuit potential changes from 0 V to- 0. 3 V with repetition were observed where the excellent rust prevention ability was kept, in the second step it decreases slowly from- 0. 1 V to- 0. 4 V with oscillation of the small potential changes where the gradual decrease of rust prevention ability was recognized and in the third step it decreases monotonously in the lower potential than- 0. 4 V where the rust was observed because of the remarkable deteriorating of the rust prevention ability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{machining}} (cutting, grinding etc.) {{is conducted}} in manufacturing. Machining fluid (cutting oil, grinding fluid) {{that consists of}} oil, surface active agent, and extreme pressure agent, anti rust agent etc. is used. It improves machining performance, but it needs waste fluid disposal that is incineration or coagulative precipitation and so on. It causes huge cost and environmental load. Furthermore, it is afraid of workers health hazard for several chemicals while machining. Therefore, the electric <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> machining method system (water machining) is proposed and developed. This method uses only harmless water (tap water etc.) as machining fluid. In this paper, improvement of electric <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> chip sedimentation system {{that is part of}} water recycle system which is used for machining water purification and re-use. On long time (3 days) preservation of iron chip in water, decreasing of rust and turbidity is examined. Improved electric <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> chip sedimentation system is equipped simple circulation filter unit newly and its effectiveness is clarified. When many quantity of iron powder (3 kg) likened to actual sludge is sunken in sedimentation water tank, if electric rust prevention and simple circulation filter activated, turbidity and colour would be decreased greatly. Therefore, it is expected that purification load of next part of filters is decreased and life-time of filter and system will be prolonged...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. For low {{environmental}} load and decreasing waste fluid disposal cost, the electric <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> machining method that uses only water as machining fluid has been developed. However, {{there are several}} problems for this practical use. In this investigation, for using this method in various regions of the world, reset and synthesis of water quality that is different in regions for containing impurity ingredient and water hardness is examined. At first, water is deionized and purified with water refine recycle system. Afterward, synthesized water is reproduced. Hardness and conductivity is adjusted in water by addition of very small amount of natural hardness ingredient CaSO 4. Consequently, even if water is different, constant quality of the water can be always secured anywhere in world. Furthermore, electric rust prevention is achieved 3 hours with adjusted 100 µS/cm synthesized water. However, adhesion derived from anode is appeared in workpiece 2 hours.

In {{order to reduce}} waste disposal cost and environmental load, decreasing machining fluid that contains several chemicals such as oil, extreme pressure agent etc. is demanded. In this investigation, the electric <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> machining method system that uses only water as machining fluid have been developed. This paper mentioned about evaluation of recycled water quality. The refined water that is purified with developed water recycle system which is installed reverse osmosis membrane (RO) is too clean to evaluate by normal method till now. Using laser turbidity meter, precise water purification is evaluated precisely. Therefore, it is clarified that RO refined water turbidity (RO 1 = 0. 0006, RO 2 = 0. 0003) is very low compared with clean tap water (0. 1207). So, water recycle system can remove contaminating fine particle from water.

The {{first is a}} syn gas plant designed for 1000 tons/day of methanol but converted to syn gas only for a primary acetic acid market. The upgrade concentrates on a carbon monoxide (CO) compressor train which upstaged an original pair of compounded centrifugal compressor casings (15 impellers) to a larger casing (first body), roughly four sizes larger at 14 impellers compound compressor casings(two). The new train uses an available larger horsepower steam turbine available from the previous process conversion and its concrete mezzanine and intercoolers located {{just south of the}} present CO train. The timetable called for conversion in one year, plus shutdown and switchover at 30 to 45 days. The second upgrade required adding a third steam turbine driven centrifugal compressor air train, which had been "mothballed" some 13 years prior. The turbine and compressor rotors were vertically immersed in plant fabricated steel containers holding VSI inhibited ISO 43 turbine oil. The empty casings on a 20 foot mezzanine were coated with a tacky <b>rust</b> <b>preventive</b> and dead head blanketed with nitrogen. The time frame was 18 months.

We prepare tea according to the traditional method with w a t e r, sugar and mint. So for 4 persons, and for each kind of tea we prepare 3 tea pots: * The first one with 10, 5 g of tea, 180 ml of water, the all boiled during 10 minutes, then add 25 g of sugar and finally serve according to taste, * The second one like the previous, but with 120 ml of water and the same content of tea (people can add some tea if we want), 10 minutes of boiling, 3 g of mint leaves (fresh or dry). The all boiled again during 5 minutes with 25 g of sugar before serving, * The third, which is the last one traditionally, is {{the continuation of the}} second teapot with only tea leaves in which we put 120 ml of water boiled during 10 minutes, 25 g of sugar added and serve. Sometimes people can add to the third teapot 5 g of dry tea and mint. The tools used to boil water are made of iron covered up by <b>rust</b> <b>preventive.</b> We can say that generally tea makers don’t measure exactly the weigh of dry tea, mint and sugar. It depends to the number of tea consumers, in this people can use the half, the quarter or the full drinking cup with dry tea. I t ’s the same for the mint, with 3 or 4 small boughs of fresh mint. As for the sugar they use 3 lumps of sugar for each full cup. A lump of sugar is about 4, 17 g of weight. So the numbers we give here are averages. Traditionally in a drinking tea session, 3 teapots are prepared in succession as described above whatever the number of persons and to each one a cup containing about 30 ml of decocted tea is served. This also is an average, because we are estimating here the half of the drinking cup we use.
