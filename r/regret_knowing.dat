60|$|The {{election}} on Miss Dunstable's part was lost. She {{carried on the}} contest nobly, fighting it to the last moment, and sparing neither her own money nor that of her antagonist; but she carried it on unsuccessfully. Many gentlemen did support Mr. Sowerby because they were willing enough to emancipate their county from the duke's thraldom; but Mr. Sowerby was felt {{to be a black}} sheep, as Lady Lufton had called him, and {{at the close of the}} election he found himself banished from the representation of West Barsetshire;--banished for ever, after having held the county for five-and-twenty years. Unfortunate Mr. Sowerby! I cannot take leave of him here without some feeling of <b>regret,</b> <b>knowing</b> that there was that within him which might, under better guidance, have produced better things. There are men, even of high birth, who seem as though they were born to be rogues; but Mr. Sowerby was, to my thinking, born to be a gentleman. That he had not been a gentleman--that he had bolted from his appointed course, going terribly on the wrong side of the posts--let us all acknowledge. It is not a gentleman-like deed, but a very blackguard action, to obtain a friend's acceptance to a bill in an unguarded hour of social intercourse. That and other similar doings have stamped his character too plainly. But, nevertheless, I claim a tear for Mr. Sowerby, and lament that he has failed to run his race discreetly, in accordance with the rules of the Jockey Club, He attempted that plan of living as a tenant in his old house at Chaldicotes, and of making a living out of the land which he farmed; but he soon abandoned it. He had no aptitude for such industry, and could not endure his altered position in the county. He soon relinquished Chaldicotes of his own accord, and has vanished away, as such men do vanish--not altogether without necessary income; to which point in the final arrangement of their joint affairs, Mrs. Thornes's man of business--if I may be allowed so far to anticipate--paid special attention. And thus Lord Dumbello, the duke's nominee, got in, as the duke's nominee had done for very many years past. There was no Nemesis here--none as yet. Nevertheless, she with the lame foot will assuredly catch him, the duke, if it be that he deserve to be caught. With us his grace's appearance has been so unfrequent that I think we may omit to make any further inquiry as to his concerns.|$|E

50|$|However, Baldr also becomes {{involved}} in Nanna after seeing her bathe naked. This angers Höðr since {{he will never}} see Nanna that way. Höðr confides his wish to murder Baldr out of envy. Loki tries to discourage him by lying that Baldr is invulnerable, a gift from a Norn; however, this only makes Höðr even more jealous. Höðr ends up stealing a magic sword from the trolls and tries to hit Baldr. However, Baldr is shown to actually be invulnerable. Frigg, worried about Loki's behaviour, has made everything that lives on the earth promise not to harm Baldr, since she is the earth goddess. The other gods make a game out of throwing weapons at Baldr for target practise since their weapons just bounce off. Loki decides to pull a prank on Höðr for all the worry he has brought him through. Loki pretends to be a norn named Þökk and tells Baldr he has a poison that will make him be able to kill Baldr. Loki gives a disgusting soup and takes a mistletoe, without much thought, and turns it into an arrow shape and tells Höðr it is a magic arrow. Höðr throws it at Baldr, hitting his heart and killing him. Frigg explains that the mistletoe does not live on the earth, it lives on trees, {{and because of that}} made no promise to Frigg. The other gods {{think of it as a}} horrible accident, but Höðr is overcome with <b>regret</b> <b>knowing</b> the truth. Loki goes into hiding, fearing the vengeance of the gods. However, both Loki and Höðr are dragged into a dream and brought to Helheim by Baldr. He tells them that when he got to Helheim, Hel mocked Loki for his clumsiness. Baldr told her that Valhalla was not as great as everyone thinks and improvised an imitation of the einherjar which caused Hel to burst into laughter. Hel's laughter changed Helheim into a beautiful forest. Seeing what Hel's laughter could do, Baldr fell in love with her, which cured Hel's depression. With Helheim being a much more pleasant place for the dead, and Baldr and Hel being a happy couple, Höðr can return to Valhalla without guilt and continue his relationship with Nanna.|$|E

50|$|I <b>regret</b> not <b>knowing</b> {{the name}} of a man I met at Tom Groggin Station, a Victorian {{property}} on the Indi River near Mt Kosciusko, who told me that he worked at Tom Groggin before he enlisted in the army and went to the first World War. He had fished the Indi before he left and it carried a great number of blue nose cod, white eye perch and greasies blackfish. While he was at war, he even dreamt about fishing the Indi. When he came home he returned to his old job at Tom Groggin and announced that before he did any work, he wanted to go fishing. Very quickly he caught a fish about a foot (30cm) in length, the like of which he had never seen before. So intrigued was he by this strange spotted but nicely shaped fish that he immediately took it to the homestead thinking it was something quite unique. At the homestead, he was told it was a brown trout. From that time both the white eye perch and the blue nose cod numbers went into decline, while the numbers of brown and rainbow trout increased. To my mind, this man did do something remarkable, he had set a very positive timeframe of a change over of fish species in the Indi River.Heads and Tales: Recollections of a Fisheries and Wildlife Officer.|$|R

40|$|Sutton, an introspective {{and very}} private man, sadly {{destroyed}} {{many of his}} personal papers before he died. His Bird Student: An Autobiography (1980) documents his life only through 1935 {{and the end of}} his Cornell days. Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s book is especially valuable, therefore, in documenting Sutton 2 ̆ 7 s later years, after he had reached his prime both as scholar and artist. Although I thought I personally knew Sutton very well and wrote a small book based on a collection of his paintings of baby birds, I learned much from Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s narrative, which details Sutton 2 ̆ 7 s World War II experiences, his often frustrating years at the University of Michigan, and finally his move in 1952 to the University of Oklahoma, where his name soon became synonymous with Oklahoma ornithology. From there Sutton made repeated field trips to Mexico and the Canadian Arctic, generating eight books and more than 150 short publications, as well as producing some of his best paintings. In addition to his richly documented text, Jackson provides a detailed account of Sutton 2 ̆ 7 s writings, a list of the books and monographs he illustrated, and the names of his graduate students and research topics. Persons who knew George Sutton will read this book with special interest and great pleasure, for it illuminates the life of this remarkable man as no other single source could do. Those who read it without having met Sutton will doubtless <b>regret</b> never <b>knowing</b> one of the giants of American ornithology...|$|R
