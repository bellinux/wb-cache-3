5|$|D0g {{retrieves}} Gordon {{out from}} under some junk outside the Citadel, and Gordon reunites with Alyx, who is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. Alyx contacts Eli Vance and Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city, and is informed the Citadel's core is at risk of exploding at any moment. Kleiner states the explosion could {{be large enough to}} level the whole of City 17, and the only way for them to survive is to re-enter the Citadel and slow the core's progression toward meltdown. Eli reluctantly agrees when he sees no other option.|$|E
5|$|He {{finds himself}} {{back in his}} car, handcuffed, but <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the green reality Bird is still alive. He gives Bird Hawkins' {{password}} ("tulip"), and the information regarding Kessel and the shipping container convinces Bird that something is wrong. He takes Michael to Harper still in cuffs but they both tell her what they have learned. Harper approves Bird's plan to send a team to the storage container but sends Michael to a cell, saying {{that if they do}} not find any evidence of his accusations, he'll go to jail for killing Hawkins.|$|E
5|$|The {{day of the}} bris arrives, and Kyle is {{grounded}} for sending Ike away. When the mohel arrives to perform the bris, Ike flees to Kyle's room in terror. Seeing Ike in distress and some old pictures prompts {{a change of heart}} in Kyle, and he defends his brother fiercely before it is explained to him what a circumcision actually is, at which point Stan and Cartman decide they want to be circumcised too. They watch the process; even though the boys pass out momentarily, Kyle is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Ike unharmed.|$|E
60|$|He {{was much}} <b>relieved</b> just then <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Mickety across the way, with a {{policeman}} beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'When Tony came up, {{frightened and}} breathless, he was <b>relieved</b> enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that neither of}} his darlings was hurt, beyond a few {{scratches}} from the brambles of the hedge. But he was rather alarmed when he heard how they were going on at one another.|$|R
60|$|Carley {{could only}} stare at him. The look he flashed at her, the sudden {{intensity}} and passion of his ringing words, were {{as if he}} gave her a glimpse into the very depths of him. He might have begun in fun, but he had finished otherwise. She felt that she really did not know this man. Had he arraigned her in judgment? A flush, seemingly hot and cold, passed over her. Then it <b>relieved</b> her <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that he had returned to his task.|$|R
5|$|Archduke Charles {{traveled}} to Villa Pianore {{and asked for}} Zita’s hand and, on 13 June 1911, their engagement was announced at the Austrian court. Zita in later years recalled that after her engagement she had expressed to Charles her worries {{about the fate of}} the Austrian Empire and the challenges of the monarchy. Charles and Zita were married at the Schwarzau castle on 21 October 1911. Charles's great-uncle, the 81-year-old Emperor Franz Joseph, attended the wedding. He was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> an heir make a suitable marriage, and was in good spirits, even leading the toast at the wedding breakfast. Archduchess Zita soon conceived a son, and Otto was born 20 November 1912. Seven more children would follow in the next decade.|$|E
25|$|Soon after, Don Calogero arrives, and the Prince is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that he's dressed quite tastelessly. His relief ends {{abruptly}} when Angelica arrives - {{he finds}} her attractive {{enough to feel}} the stir of lust. At dinner, Angelica flirts openly with Tancredi—who, in his turn, finds himself attracted to both Angelica's beauty and her money. For her part, Concetta is enraged.|$|E
25|$|Two schoolfriends, who {{had also}} been {{evacuated}} from Singapore to Batavia, heard that Gorton was in hospital, arranged {{for them to be}} put on a ship for Fremantle, which left on 23 February and treated Gorton's wounds. When the ship arrived in Fremantle, on 3 March, one of Gorton's arm wounds had become septic and needed extensive treatment. However, he was more concerned about the effect that the sight of his mutilated face would have on his wife. It is reported that Betty Gorton, who had been running the farm in his absence, was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Gorton alive.|$|E
50|$|Amblyopia will {{be treated}} via {{occlusion}} treatment (using patching or atropine drops) of the non-squinting eye {{with the aim of}} achieving full alternation of fixation. Management thereafter will be surgical. As alternative to surgery, also botulinum toxin therapy has been used in children with infantile esotropia. Furthermore, as accompaniment to ophtalmologic treatment, craniosacral therapy may be performed in order <b>to</b> <b>relieve</b> tension (<b>see</b> also: Management of strabismus).|$|R
6000|$|Jerry shrank {{within himself}} like a guilty thing {{caught in the}} act, and glanced uneasily round to {{ascertain}} how much {{of death and destruction}} had been dealt out. <b>Relieved</b> somewhat <b>to</b> <b>see</b> no one writhing in blood, he arose, and, in much confusion, replied to the numerous eager queries as to what he had fired at. When the true state of affairs became manifest, most of the Dutchmen, who had been active enough when aroused by supposed danger, sauntered back to their couches with a good-natured chuckle; the settlers who had [...] "turned out" [...] growled or chaffed, according to temperament, as they followed suit, and the natives spent half an hour in uproarious merriment over Booby's dramatic representation of the whole incident, which he performed with graphic power and much embellishment.|$|R
60|$|The cabin {{appeared}} to be enveloped in a soft, swishing, hollow sound. It seeped and rustled. Then the sound lulled, only to rise again. Carley went <b>to</b> the door, <b>relieved</b> and glad <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the duststorm was blowing by. The great sky-high pall of yellow had {{moved on to the}} north. Puffs of dust were whipping along the road, but no longer in one continuous cloud. In the west, low down the sun was sinking, a dull magenta in hue, quite weird and remarkable.|$|R
25|$|At {{some point}} during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra {{suggests}} that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which {{may have contributed to}} their animosity. Josephine is quoted in I Married Wyatt Earp as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home when she heard the sound of gunfire. Running into town {{in the direction of the}} shots, Josephine was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that Wyatt was uninjured.|$|E
500|$|Seydlitz {{recalled}} his cavalry. This in itself was unusual: normally, a cavalry attacked once, maybe twice, {{and spent the}} rest of the battle chasing fleeing troops. Seydlitz led his rallied force toward the flank and rear of the Allied army, about [...] out of the fighting and into a copse of trees between Reichertsweben and Obschutz. There horses and men could catch their breath. The Allies, <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the last of the horsemen, became preoccupied with the Prussian infantry, about four battalions of it, threatening in linear formation to their left. Instead of forming into a similar line of attack, though, the Allied battalions formed into columns, fixed their bayonets and marched forward, prepared for a charge.|$|E
500|$|Visiting Andy in the hospital, Ann {{suddenly}} kisses him, but immediately {{stops and}} guiltily walks out. Later, April, also <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Andy is fine, finally agrees {{to go out}} with him. After they kiss, Andy decides to be honest and tells her about the earlier kiss with Ann. April angrily storms out, taking back her decision {{to go out with}} him. That night, Leslie sits on a bench in the empty Lot 48 and Mark joins her, with both appearing happy {{to be able to talk}} to each other. Mark tells her that if more people like her worked in local government, he wouldn't be leaving, and gives her plans he drew up for a park at Lot 48 before giving her a goodbye kiss on the cheek and walking way forever. The next day, Ron withdraws from the budget task force and appoints Leslie in his place. As Tom (Aziz Ansari) and his new girlfriend Lucy (Natalie Morales) are clearing out his office, he notices Ron is wearing a red shirt and black pants, the [...] "Tiger Woods" [...] outfit he always wears the day after having sex. Tom's ex-wife Wendy (Jama Williamson) then appears and kisses Ron and the two leave together, shocking Tom.|$|E
60|$|They set out, Mabel and Carroll leading, {{and drawing}} {{farther away from}} the two behind. The rain began in earnest as they descended. Rock slope and {{scattered}} stones were slippery, and Vane found it difficult to keep his footing on some of their lichened surfaces. He was <b>relieved,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that his companion seldom hesitated, and they made their way downward cautiously, until near the spot where the three ridges diverged they walked into a belt of drifting mist. The peak above them was suddenly blotted out, and Evelyn bade Vane hail Carroll and Mabel, who had disappeared. He sent a shout ringing through the vapor, and caught a faint and unintelligible answer. A flock of sheep fled past and dislodged a rush of sliding stones. Vane heard the stones rattle far down the hillside, and when he called again a blast of chilly wind whirled his voice away. There was a faint echo above him and then silence.|$|R
2500|$|In October 1818, at {{the request}} of Oliver Hazard Perry, a very close friend, Decatur arrived at New York to act as his second in a duel between Perry and Captain John Heath, {{commander}} of Marines on [...] The two officers were involved in a personal disagreement while aboard that ship, that resulted in Heath challenging Perry to a duel. Perry had written to Decatur nearly a year previously, revealing that {{he had no intention of}} firing any shot at Heath. After the two duelists and their seconds assembled the duel took place. [...] One shot was fired; Heath missed his opponent while Perry, keeping his word, returned no fire. At this point Decatur approached Heath with Perry's letter in hand, relating to Heath that Perry all along had no intention of returning fire and asking Heath if his honor had thus been satisfied. Heath admitted that it had. Decatur was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>see</b> the matter resolved with no loss of life or limb to either of his friends, urging both to now put the matter behind them.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You needn't have explained: {{it was not}} my {{business}} at all.' Miss Elfride was rather <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> hear that statement, nevertheless. 'And you won't come again <b>to</b> <b>see</b> my father?' she insisted.|$|R
500|$|Michael {{passes out}} and remembers events shortly {{before and after}} the crash; Hannah and Rex are singing the Queen song, [...] "Bohemian Rhapsody". Later, Michael meets with Emma's father Joaquin (Carlos Lacamara) at a coffee shop to discuss the new baby, the mystery man appears to let Michael know that he sees the real mystery man through the window and Michael chases after him. When a police artist (Chad Cleven) draws an image of the man, his real name is {{revealed}} to be Ed Hawkins (Kevin Weisman), another detective who took over Michael's spot at the police department after the crash, now working with Bird (Steve Harris), Michael's former partner in the [...] "red reality" [...] and his current one in the [...] "green reality". Michael meets with Bird and Hawkins and the latter says {{that he was one of}} the first on the scene of the crash and that he is sorry about Rex's death. Michael starts to believe that his son is really dead; he remembers the crash, yet again, with additional information. Michael realizes that Hawkins was trying to kill him in the crash. As soon as he figures out the situation, Michael wakes up with Rex and Emma; he is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Rex. After the carnival, Michael phones Dr. Evans to tell her what he now knows about the crash.|$|E
2500|$|According to Eamon Duffy, [...] "one of {{the worst}} {{elements}} in Martin's suffering was the knowledge that while he still lived the Roman Church had bowed to imperial commands, and had elected a new pope", Pope Eugenius I. According to Ekonomou, [...] "the Romans were as prepared to forget Pope Martin as Constans II was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him removed to the remote northern shores of the Black Sea". Thirty years later, the Sixth Ecumenical Council would vindicate the council's condemnation of Monothelitism, but not before the synod [...] "ushered {{in the period of}} Rome's [...] "Greek intermezzo'".|$|E
2500|$|Now quite paranoid, Hendricksson {{worries that}} Jessica {{could be a}} screamer as well. [...] He slashes her hand, and is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> blood {{dripping}} from the wound. They locate an emergency escape shuttle, but it can carry only one person. Hendricksson offers the shuttle to Jessica; but a second [...] "Jessica" [...] arrives, confirming {{that she is a}} screamer after all, and even more human-like. [...] Hendricksson resigns himself to death; but to his surprise, Jessica shields him, then sacrifices herself in battle with her lookalike. [...] With her last breath, Jessica confesses her love for Hendricksson.|$|E
6000|$|... "He will be <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> {{get him off}} {{his hands}} for a while; but Edgar will be over <b>to</b> <b>see</b> you during the afternoon. He's {{spending}} {{a week or two}} with the Charltons." ...|$|R
60|$|The water, however, hardly covered their ankles; {{and some}} time {{afterward}} Andrew touched Whitney's arm as a dim, formless mass {{rose from the}} sand. It got plainer as they cautiously approached it, their bare feet falling noiselessly, and in {{a minute or two}} they stopped and listened beside the wreck. There was no sound but the drip of water, and Andrew, grasping a broken beam, swung himself up. Whitney followed, his nerves tense, his muscles braced; and he held his breath when he dropped into the forecastle. The next moment a pale light sprang up, and he saw Andrew holding out a match. The feeble glow spread along the wet planks and filled the forecastle before the match went out, and Whitney was more <b>relieved</b> than disappointed <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that nobody else was there.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I'll {{see about}} it this very day." [...] He seemed <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> get her off his hands by this arrangement, {{and as far}} as they were {{concerned}} the matter was settled. She now simply waited <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the lady again.|$|R
2500|$|The {{reviews in}} later years were mostly positive. In 1998, A. J. Jacobs of Entertainment Weekly graded this finale a B+, calling it [...] "a {{satisfying}} nightcap" [...] and [...] "sharply written by the [...] ", with its final moments [...] "classy as a flute of chilled Cristal." [...] In 2006, Ron Geraci, {{author of the book}} The Bachelor Chronicles: A Dating Memoir, called it [...] "raw and moving" [...] and [...] "significant." [...] In 2007, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly called it one of his [...] "Five Best (pre-Sopranos) Series Finales." [...] In 2007, Douglas Durden of The Richmond Times-Dispatch named it his fifth most favorite television finale of all-time. In 2009, the A.V. Club ranked it No. 3 in [...] "10 American TV Series with Satisfying Endings" [...] in the book Inventory. In 2010, Sharon Knolle of The Huffington Post was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the final onscreen romance between Sam and Diane end rather than conclude with their marriage. In the same year, Oliver Miller of The Huffington Post was heartbroken by Sam and Diane's on-screen [...] "absurd protracted double-gut-punch break-up" [...] in the episode. Claire Suddath from Time magazine called it one of top ten [...] "anticipated" [...] finales ever. In 2011, the finale was ranked fifth on the TV Guide Network special, TV's Most Unforgettable Finales. In 2014, IGN ranked it number six of the top ten Cheers episodes.|$|E
60|$|Ann caught Jimmy's eye. She was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> {{that he was}} not {{disturbed}} by this sudden development.|$|E
60|$|Her {{last words}} were almost a wail. I was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that the tears {{were in her}} eyes at last.|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothing puts it into you, my dear!" [...] Miriam returned. Then she pursued to Peter: [...] "You're the {{faithful}} one--you're the one I count on." [...] He {{was not looking}} at her; his eyes travelled into the carriage, where they rested on Nick Dormer, established on the farther seat with his face turned toward the farther window. He was the one, faithful or no, counted on or no, whom a charming woman had preferred to carry off, and there was clear triumph for him in that fact. Yet it pleased, it somewhat <b>relieved,</b> his kinsman <b>to</b> <b>see</b> his passivity as not a little foolish. Miriam noted something of this in Peter's eyes, for she exclaimed abruptly, [...] "Don't kill him--he doesn't care for me!" [...] With which she passed into the carriage and let it roll away.|$|R
50|$|Jamie, who {{is shocked}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her, lets her {{stay for the}} weekend. Rachel enjoys finally feeling close to her brother again. While in Toronto, she reunites with Hazel. She has just had Mr. Tompkins' baby. The shock wears off, and she is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> have {{declined}} counselling.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Gow {{runs into}} Juggler Barrows. Barrows is {{astonished}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him, as Gow had deceived him into believing he was Corey. Gow is <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> ascertain that Sergeant Kelly {{did not believe}} Barrows when {{he claimed to have}} spoken to [...] "Corey" [...] some time after the real Corey had been killed. He lures Barrows away. Later, Barrows' dead body is flung from a speeding car.|$|R
60|$|Mr Verloc, {{without looking}} at his wife, {{walked up to the}} Chief Inspector, who was <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him return alone.|$|E

50|$|The next day, Arthur {{decides to}} go to Murdock to try and buy his land from him so that he can, in turn, give is to Dick {{to help him with}} Norah and Joyce. Murdock agrees but only after he has {{finished}} his investigations which he states will take him about a month. Arthur is very excited to tell Dick that he bought Murdock's land but as they are talking, Dick tells Arthur that the bog is becoming more dangerous in Murdock's area because if the bog shifts again there is a deep reservoir right where his house is located. Arthur asks is he has told Murdock about this problem and Dick says yes, last night. Arthur decides to not tell Dick of his purchase. After Arthur has his documents in order to purchase the land, he climbs the hill <b>to</b> <b>see</b> its beauty. He unexpectedly finds his unknown woman. Both are very joyful and <b>relieved</b> <b>to</b> finally <b>see</b> each other again and Arthur finally learns her name: Norah Joyce. He proclaims his love for her and wants her to be his wife but she tells Arthur that she needs time to think. On his way home, Arthur is struck with the thought of his dear friend Dick and he questions if Dick has also made a proposal to her. The next day, Norah tells Arthur that she cannot marry him because she must stay with her father but she does admit to being in love with Arthur. Arthur finally meets with Dick and Dick inquiries him about his unknown love. Arthur admits that it is Norah and Dick is very upset. Dick also questions him about buying Murdock's land because Dick does not have as much money as Arthur, was Arthur trying to place Dick in a false position in Norah's eyes? Arthur explains his plan in buying Murdock's land, he even allows Dick to read the deed from his lawyer and Dick forgives him.|$|R
6000|$|Lane {{pretended not}} to notice {{anything}} unusual, and after a few casual remarks and queries he left them. Strolling from place to place, mingling with the gay groups, in the more secluded alcoves and recesses where couples appeared, oblivious to eyes, in the check room where a sign read: [...] "check your corsets," [...] out in the wide landing where the stairway came up, Lane passed, missing little that might have been seen or heard. He did not mind that two of the chaperones stared at him in supercilious curiosity, as if speculating on a possible faux pas of his at this dance. Both boys and girls he had met since his return to Middleville, and some he had known before, encountered him face to face, and cut him dead. He heard sarcastic remarks. He was an outsider, a [...] "dead one," [...] a [...] "has been" [...] and a [...] "lemon." [...] But Margaret was gracious to him, and Flossie Dickerson made no bones of her regard. Dorothy, he was <b>relieved</b> and glad <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> was not present.|$|R
60|$|All at once Ellen {{felt cold}} shivers steal over her. Isbel's {{piercing}} gaze was directed straight at her hiding place. Her heart stopped beating. If he discovered her there {{she felt that}} she would die of shame. Then she became aware that a blue jay was screeching in a pine above her, and a red squirrel somewhere near was chattering his shrill annoyance. These two denizens of the woods could be depended upon to espy the wariest hunter and make known his presence to their kind. Ellen had a moment of more than dread. This keen-eyed, keen-eared Indian might see right through her brushy covert, might hear the throbbing of her heart. It <b>relieved</b> her immeasurably <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him turn away and take to pacing the promontory, with his head bowed and his hands behind his back. He had stopped looking off into the forest. Presently he wheeled to the west, and by the light upon his face Ellen saw that the time was near sunset. Turkeys were beginning to gobble back on the ridge.|$|R
