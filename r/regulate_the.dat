5|$|An mRNA {{may contain}} {{regulatory}} elements itself, such as riboswitches, in the 5' untranslated region or 3' untranslated region; these cis-regulatory elements <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> activity of that mRNA.

5000|$|After the Great Depression of the 1930s, the American economy {{experienced}} robust growth, with periodic lesser recessions, for {{the rest}} of the 20th century.

5|$|Apart {{from these}} two tightly bound protein subunits, many {{proteins}} interact with the exosome complex in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of cells. These loosely associated proteins may <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> activity and specificity of the exosome complex. In the cytoplasm, the exosome interacts with AU rich element (ARE) binding proteins (e.g. KRSP and TTP), which can promote or prevent degradation of mRNAs. The nuclear exosome associates with RNA binding proteins (e.g. MPP6/Mpp6 and C1D/Rrp47 in humans/yeast) that are required for processing certain substrates.|$|E

5|$|Approximately {{two-thirds of}} human serpins perform {{extracellular}} roles, inhibiting proteases {{in the bloodstream}} in order to modulate their activities. For example, extracellular serpins <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> proteolytic cascades central to blood clotting (antithrombin), the inflammatory and immune responses (antitrypsin, antichymotrypsin, and C1-inhibitor) and tissue remodelling (PAI-1). By inhibiting signalling cascade proteases, they can also affect development.

5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{is listed}} in Part 1 Group 1 of Schedule 13 of the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974; this means that as a common and secure species it is {{exempted}} from any licensing or tagging requirements under the 2002–2005 management plan to minimise and <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> use of protected and threatened plants in the cut-flower industry in New South Wales.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{communications}} in animals {{rely on a}} variety of aspects including taste and smell. Chemoreception is the physiological response of a sense organ (i.e. taste or smell) to a chemical stimulus where the chemicals act as signals to <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> state or activity of a cell. A semiochemical is a message-carrying chemical that is meant to attract, repel, and convey information. Types of semiochemicals include pheromones and kairomones. One example is the butterfly Phengaris arion which uses chemical signals as a form of mimicry to aid in predation.|$|E
50|$|The {{cholinergic}} anti-inflammatory pathway <b>regulates</b> <b>the</b> innate {{immune response}} to injury, pathogens, and tissue ischemia.

5|$|Epigenetic {{changes in}} {{eukaryotic}} biology serve to <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> process of cellular differentiation. During morphogenesis, totipotent stem cells become the various pluripotent cell {{lines of the}} embryo, which in turn become fully differentiated cells. A single fertilised egg cell, the zygote, {{gives rise to the}} many different plant cell types including parenchyma, xylem vessel elements, phloem sieve tubes, guard cells of the epidermis, etc. as it continues to divide. The process results from the epigenetic activation of some genes and inhibition of others.|$|E
5|$|Hormones {{can act as}} immunomodulators, {{altering}} {{the sensitivity of the}} immune system. For example, female sex hormones are known immunostimulators of both adaptive and innate immune responses. Some autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus strike women preferentially, and their onset often coincides with puberty. By contrast, male sex hormones such as testosterone seem to be immunosuppressive. Other hormones appear to <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> immune system as well, most notably prolactin, growth hormone and vitamin D.|$|E

5|$|In 1959, Singapore {{attained}} self-government and the City Council was dissolved. The Government {{felt that}} a national anthem was needed to unite the different races in Singapore. The Deputy Prime Minister Toh Chin Chye selected the City Council's song as it was already popular. At Toh's request, Zubir modified the lyrics and melody, and the revised song {{was adopted by the}} Legislative Assembly on 11 November 1959. On 30 November, the Singapore State Arms and Flag and National Anthem Ordinance 1959 was passed to <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> use and display of these national emblems.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> inflammatory response. They {{are most often}} associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils are related to neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E
5|$|More {{primitive}} relatives such as Noasaurus and Ceratosaurus had longer, mobile {{arms with}} fingers and claws. Paleobiologist Alexander O. Vargas have suggested {{a major reason}} for the evolution towards vestigial forelimbs in the group was because of a genetic defect; the loss of function in HOXA11 and HOXD11, two genes which <b>regulate</b> <b>the</b> forelimbs' development.|$|E
