40|$|We {{address the}} {{changing}} {{relationship of the}} state vis-à-vis <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> on issues of state policy performance, partnership legitimacy, and the role and position of the state. Theoretical expectations regarding these issues differ greatly according to whether a state-centric or a society-centric perspective is adopted. A general case study of Dutch area-based rural policy (1988 – 2008) reveals that changes predominantly lean towards the state-centric perspective. These changes include an increased usage of <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> as state instruments, an improved democratic anchorage of <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships,</b> and {{a continuation of the}} state’s privileged position. An embedded case study shows that individual partnerships can continue to develop in other directions and can institutionalise into largely self-organising partnerships. We conclude by showing that <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> can serve as state instruments, provided that a certain degree of self-organisation is possible. Overregulation of <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> could eventually undermine their overall performance...|$|R
40|$|A {{transition}} of society to more sustainable energy solutions appears necessary because traditional energy supply is endangered {{and the use}} of traditional energy sources has negative impacts on the environment. Partnerships are collaborative arrangements through which actors can strive for sustainability. The literature review reveals that <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> in the sustainable energy field compose a new focus of research on partnership and governance. This research aims to analyse in what way and to what extent <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> may contribute to solving the problem of a transition to a sustainable energy society. An analytical model is derived from a theoretical framework based on partnership, capacity and network theory. On the basis of both the theoretical framework and the analytical model three cases are selected. All cases are located in urban areas, have an objective that relates to sustainable energy related issues and involve actors from at least two spheres of society. Germany is chosen as the context of the <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> due to the quite favourable environment for renewable energies. In a comparative case study the selected <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> are analysed by means of a document review and semi-structured interviews. The analysis is guided by the predefined analytical model. It assumes that the package deals made, the actors involved, their relations, partnership capacities and the context in which <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> are embedded shape regional partnerships' contribution to solving the transition problem. Relation capacity is studied by employing a network analysis tool. The <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> take different approaches to the transition problem. In Hanover region, a regional climate protection agency promotes the development of sustainable technologies and a change in behaviour of citizens. An energy region association with a focus on business development, research projects and networking implicitly aims for a structural change in Nuremberg region. In Munich, an alliance for climate protection facilitates network building and activates business and civil society to implement measures for climate protection. The analysis shows that <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> facilitate particularly information exchange and embrace a pragmatic network strategy. Hence, they often fulfil a function of information provision and dissemination. The objective of the <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> studied is strongly shaped by economic interests. Moreover, <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> remain dependent on state actors which often take on an important role. Thus, the contribution of <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> to solving the problem of a transition to a sustainable energy society is perceived as small. Despite the mixed feelings, the policy strategy of <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> is not discarded and further research on the effects of <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> is recommended...|$|R

25|$|In 1993, {{ownership}} of the then Salem Buccaneers were looking to sell the franchise. As the existing Municipal Stadium was not adequate {{to meet the needs}} of the franchise, Salem leaders looked at options to construct a new stadium in an effort to keep the franchise from relocating. In January 1994, Salem leaders approached both the City of Roanoke and Roanoke County in an effort to develop a <b>regional</b> <b>partnership</b> to construct a stadium. In March 1994, the Salem City Council decided a nonbinding referendum would be held later that summer to let the city residents decide if a new facility should be constructed. On July 19, Salem voters voted in favor of constructing a new ballpark with 2,236 people voting for and 398 voting against the proposal. With its citizens strongly supporting its construction, the Salem City Council voted unanimously on July 25 to approve construction of a new stadium.|$|E

5000|$|Global {{city and}} {{regional}} partnerships: Beyond the local scale, {{the success of}} urban climate governance depends on horizontal and vertical collaboration between regions and cities.

These can be built into public non-state networks, for example the C40 network, the Global Cities Covenant on Climate, the Cities for Climate Protection Programme (CCPP) and the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives. Through these networks, mitigation measures and adaptation strategies can be adopted by participating cities worldwide. A criticism of global city and <b>regional</b> <b>partnerships</b> is that their exclusive nature limits influence to participating cities and regions which risks drawing resources away from less powerful city and regional actors.|$|R
