40|$|International audienceIn {{this study}} we {{determined}} whether craniofacial development in rats could be influenced by an early temporary (3 d) nasal obstruction associated with forced oral breathing. The rats were killed at specific time points after surgery. Plasma samples were taken for biochemical analyses, and cephalometric measurements were performed. Shortly after nasal obstruction, the vertical nasomaxillary complex and the longitudinal skull base proved to be smaller in both sexes of test rats compared with controls. This was maintained in male rats but not in female rats. In female rats, only the longitudinal skull base remained somewhat shorter as the animals grew older. <b>Reversible</b> <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> was further associated with reduced dimensions of the olfactory bulbs lasting into adulthood and an initial decrease in lung weight. One day after implementing nasal obstruction, basal corticosterone levels had increased (by over 1, 000 %) and stayed {{at a high level}} in female rats. In male rats, however, the corticosterone level seemed to return to normal by day 90. Oral breathing was also associated with a lower level of thyroid hormone, especially at the shorter term intervals in both sexes.

40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} was {{designed}} to examine behavioral responses (interpreted as preferences) to olfactory cues (nest bedding odor and odors of estrous and anestrus females) in adult male rats after they had a short term <b>reversible,</b> bilateral, <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> (RbNO) as developing rat pups. These results were compared to behavior of control (untreated) and sham operated male littermates. Behavioral tests and physiological parameters were analyzed 90 days after recovery of nasal breathing. Experiments investigated the time spent in arms or the center of a maze of male rats in response to odors from the nest bedding or from adult females. There were no differences in responses between untreated, sham and RbNO adult male rats to fresh and nest bedding odors. RbNO males spent more time {{in the center of the}} maze when given a choice of estrus or anestrus female odors, or bedding odors from untreated or sham operated female rats. In contrast untreated and sham male rats preferred the odors of estrous females and of untreated or sham females. Plasma corticosterone levels in the males increased during the behavioral tests. Plasma testosterone levels were significantly lower in RbNO males compared to untreated males and did not increase during the behavioral tests compared to sham operated males. Males from all groups had similar preferences for the odor of bedding from adult RbNO females. Plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were increased in RbNO adults.

40|$|Conclusions. A {{paradoxical}} {{relationship between}} objective and subjective measures of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> exists in participants {{not exposed to}} any treatment.

Improved methods for measuring nasal sensations are required to further investigate the relationship between objective and subjective measures of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction.</b> Objectives. In a recent study it was shown that the subjective sensation of nasal patency increased as the nasal passages became objectively more obstructed in patients who received a placebo compared to those who received an oral decongestant. This paradoxical response may be explained as a placebo effect, i. e. patients who received a placebo may have expected to feel less obstructed.

The {{purpose of this study}} is to model the effects of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> on airflow parameters under CPAP using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and to clarify quantitatively the relation between airflow velocity and pressure loss coefficient in subjects with and without <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction.</b> We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of 16 Japanese adult subjects, of whom 9 had <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> and 7 did not (control group). Three-dimensional reconstructed models of the nasal cavity and nasopharynx with a CPAP mask fitted to the nostrils were created from each subject's CT scans.

Oral administration of olopatadine at 0. 1, 1 and 3 mg/kg significantly inhibited the increases in TXB 2 and histamine levels. At 3 mg/kg, olopatadine also ameliorated the <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> caused 10 min after antigen challenge, as determined by acoustic rhinometry. ConclusionsThese results suggest that the amelioration by olopatadine of the allergic <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> involves the inhibition of the release of TXA 2 and histamine...|$|R
40|$|Data from {{observational}} {{studies suggest}} that <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> contributes to the pathogenesis of snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA). To define more accurately the relationship between snoring, OSA and <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction,</b> the current authors have summarised the literature on epidemiological and physiological studies, and performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials in which the effects of treating <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> on snoring and OSA were investigated. Searches of bibliographical databases revealed nine trials with randomised controlled design. External nasal dilators were used in five studies, topically applied steroids in one, nasal decongestants in two, and surgical treatment in one study. Data from studies using nasal dilators, intranasal steroids and decongestants to relieve nasal congestion showed beneficial effects on sleep architecture, but only minor improvement of OSA symptoms or severity. Snoring seemed to be reduced by nasal dilators. Nasal surgery also had minimal impact on OSA symptoms. In conclusion, chronic <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> seems to play a minor role in the pathogenesis of obstructive sleep apnoea, {{and seems to be}} of some relevance in the origin of snoring. The impact of treating <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in patients with snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea on long-term outcome remains to be defined through randomised controlled trials of medical and surgical therapies...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Two main {{causes of}} <b>nasal</b> airway <b>obstruction</b> and mouth {{breathing}} Consist: 1 - anterior <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> {{is caused by}} <b>obstruction</b> in <b>nasal</b> cavity, 2 - posterior (nasopharyngeal) obstruction is caused by adenoid enlargement and decreased nasopharyngeal airway. The {{purpose of this study}} was the comparison of nasopharyngeal cephalometric measurements between two groups of mouth breathing with anterior (nasal cavity) and posterior (nasopharyngeal) obstructions. Methods: In this descriptive study, a sample of 79 mouth breathers between the ages of 7 and 15 years old were selected in two anterior and posterior <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> groups. The sample had 39 patients with nasopharyngeal obstruction and mean of 10. 87 years old in posterior obstruction group and 40 patients with <b>nasal</b> cavity <b>obstruction</b> without nasopharyngeal obstruction and mean of 10. 97 years old in anterior obstruction group. After clinical examination by orthodontist, type of obstruction was diagnosed by ENT specialist. For each patient a lateral cephalogram was taken in centric occlusion. After tracing, 8 nasopharyngeal variables were measured and statistical t-test was conducted by calculating the mean, standard deviation and p-value of parameters. Results: In posterior <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> group, nasopharyngeal airway variables (PP, Ad. pmp and Air area) significantly decreased and nasopharyngeal bony variables (d and NP area) significantly increased. From bony nasopharyngeal measurements, mean of h, Ba. pmp and N. S. Ba variables insignificantly increased in posterior <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> group. Conclusion: We conclude that in lateral cephalometric radiography, in posterior <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> group nasopharyngeal airway measurements decrease and bony nasopharyngeal measurements increase...|$|R
40|$|When {{we discuss}} nasal dysfunction, we think {{primarily}} of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction.</b> However, other clinical signs like rhinorrheoa, sneezing, itching, burning {{and loss of}} smell, as well as perception of the form and aesthetics of the nose should not be neglected. During the last decades, we have significantly increased our knowledge on nasal function. We are {{more aware of the}} role of questioning the patients about their symptoms, about their most bothersome symptoms and also their quality of life, and we more often report on objective measure- ments of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> like PNIF, acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry. It has clearly been shown that the correlation between symptoms of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> and objective measu- rements is lo...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: <b>Nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in {{children}} is a very common complaint in daily ENT consultations. The common cold, rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis,hypertrophy and inflammation of the adenoid pad are very common causes of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction,</b> but there are numerous other causes for which the clinician must be aware. Methodology: The authors report a very unusual case of a primary mucocele of the middle turbinate of a 7 -year-old girl masquerading as a nasal tumour. Results: The mucocele was successfully marsupialized surgically using an endonasal endoscopic approach. The authors report the case, imaging, and review the pertinent literature. Conclusion: Clinicians {{must be aware of}} less common aetiologies of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in order to orientate the diagnostic work-up and to propose adequate management...|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{validate}} the applicability of the PolyVinyliDene Fluoride (PVDF) nasal sensor to assess the nasal airflow, in healthy subjects and patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> and to correlate the results with the score of Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Methods: PVDF nasal sensor and VAS measurements were carried out in 50 subjects (25 -healthy subjects and 25 patients). The VAS score of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> and peak-to-peak amplitude (Vp-p) of nasal cycle measured by PVDF nasal sensors were analyzed for right nostril (RN) and left nostril (LN) in both the groups. Spearman's rho correlation was calculated. The relationship between PVDF nasal sensor measurements and severity of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> (VAS score) were assessed by ANOVA. Results: In healthy group, the measurement of nasal airflow by PVDF nasal sensor for RN and LN were found to be 51. 14 +/- 5. 87 % and 48. 85 +/- 5. 87 %, respectively. In patient group, PVDF nasal sensor indicated lesser nasal airflow in the blocked nostrils (RN: 23. 33 +/- 10. 54 % and LN: 32. 24 +/- 11. 54 %). Moderate correlation was observed in healthy group (r = 0. 710, p < 0. 001 for RN and r = 0. 651, p < 0. 001 for LN), and moderate to strong correlation in patient group (r = 0. 751, p < 0. 01 for RN and r = 0. 885, p < 0. 0001 for LN). Conclusion: PVDF nasal sensor method is a newly developed technique for measuring the nasal airflow. Moderate to strong correlation was observed between PVDF nasal sensor data and VAS scores for <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction.</b> In our present study, PVDF nasal sensor technique successfully differentiated between healthy subjects and patients with <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction.</b> Additionally, it can also assess severity of <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in comparison with VAS. Thus, we propose that the PVDF nasal sensor technique could be used as a new diagnostic method to evaluate <b>nasal</b> <b>obstruction</b> in routine clinical practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
