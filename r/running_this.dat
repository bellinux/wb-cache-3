5|$|John Adams was <b>running</b> <b>this</b> {{time with}} Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina (the elder brother of {{candidate}} Thomas Pinckney from the 1796 election). Hamilton now toured New England, again urging northern electors to hold firm for Pinckney in the renewed hope of making Pinckney president; and he again intrigued in South Carolina. Hamilton's ideas involved coaxing middle-state Federalists {{to assert their}} non-support for Adams {{if there was no}} support for Pinckney and writing to more of the modest supports of Adams concerning his supposed misconduct while president. Hamilton expected to see southern states such as the Carolinas cast their votes for Pinckney and Jefferson, and would result in the former being ahead of both Adams and Jefferson.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to a novel hull which let her attain speed at far less power than other big liners, Normandie was filled with technical feats. She had turbo-electric transmission, with turbo-generators and electric propulsion motors built by Alsthom of Belfort. CGT chose turbo-electric transmission for {{the ability to use}} full power in reverse, and because, according to CGT officials, it was quieter and more easily controlled and maintained. The engine installation was heavier than conventional turbines and slightly less efficient at high speed but allowed all propellers to operate even if one engine was not <b>running.</b> <b>This</b> system also made it possible to eliminate astern turbines. An early form of radar was installed to prevent collisions.|$|E

25|$|Hybrid (or twin source) heat pumps: when {{outdoor air}} is above 4 to 8 Celsius, (40-50 Fahrenheit, {{depending}} on ground water temperature) they use air; when air is colder, {{they use the}} ground source. These twin source systems can also store summer heat, by running ground source water through the air exchanger or through the building heater-exchanger, even when the heat pump itself is not <b>running.</b> <b>This</b> has dual advantage: it functions as a low running cost for air cooling, and (if ground water is relatively stagnant) it cranks up {{the temperature of the}} ground source, which improves the energy efficiency of the heat pump system by roughly 4% for each degree in temperature rise of the ground source.|$|E
25|$|Mick Potter was {{announced}} as {{the successor to}} Anderson, which received many plaudits from the St Helens fans and the European game as a whole, as the year previous he had led Catalans Dragons to a record—high third—placed finish in the league. On 9 August 2009, St Helens reached a record 9th consecutive Challenge Cup semi—final, where they were beaten by 24 points to 14 by Huddersfield. This prevented Saints from reaching the final at the new Wembley Stadium for a third successive time and from winning the cup for a fourth time <b>running.</b> <b>This</b> defeat naturally {{came as a shock}} to the St Helens faithful, after so often in the last 15 years seeing the team reach the pinnacle of this competition and go on to win the cup. It was from here that the criticism began, and questions were raised particularly of his tactics and his activity (or lack of) in the transfer market.|$|E
25|$|Spuhler's {{hypothesis}} is a stand-alone hypothesis of extended female sexuality. Spuhler suggests that extended female sexuality has evolved as {{a by-product of}} an adaptation in females that increases the levels of adrenal hormones. He proposed that secretion of higher levels of adrenal hormones were initially selected in women {{in order to increase}} endurance for walking or <b>running.</b> <b>This</b> hypothesis suggests that the larger adrenal glands {{may have contributed to the}} development of extended female sexuality as they are also the main source of 'libido hormones', which increase the female's sexual drive. Thus, extended sexuality is little to do with sexual behavior, or evolutionary advantage, but rather it is just a by-product of hormones. However, this hypothesis cannot account for extended female sexuality in invertebrates, which lack adrenal systems. Additionally Spuhler highlighted the existence of larger thyroid and adrenal glands in humans compared to other primates. However, no empirical evidence has established the link between hormones and endurance walking as an adaptation and extended female sexuality as a natural incidental effect. As there are costs to extended sexuality, it can be argued that selection would serve the dissociation of extended sexuality from the mechanism that affects endurance walking.|$|E

Furthermore, these dialogs are primitive, mostly unchanged since 1984. The lack of aliases, shortcuts to files, was another limitation of file management on System 6.

500|$|In 2001, Bruce Rothschild {{and others}} {{published}} a study examining evidence for stress fractures and tendon avulsions in theropod dinosaurs {{and the implications}} for their behavior. Since stress fractures are caused by repeated trauma rather than singular events {{they are more likely}} to be caused by the behavior of the animal than other kinds of injury. Stress fractures and tendon avulsions occurring in the forelimb have special behavioral significance since while injuries to the feet could be caused by running or migration, resistant prey items are the most probable source of injuries to the hand. Allosaurus was one of only two theropods examined in the study to exhibit a tendon avulsion, and in both cases the avulsion occurred on the forelimb. When the researchers looked for stress fractures, they found that Allosaurus had a significantly greater number of stress fractures than Albertosaurus, Ornithomimus or Archaeornithomimus. Of the 47 hand bones the researchers studied, 3 were found to contain stress fractures. Of the feet, 281 bones were studied and 17 found to have stress fractures. The stress fractures in the foot bones [...] "were distributed to the proximal phalanges" [...] and occurred across all three weight-bearing toes in [...] "statistically indistinguishable" [...] numbers. Since the lower end of the third metatarsal would have contacted the ground first while an allosaur was running it would have borne the most stress. If the allosaurs' stress fractures were caused by damage accumulating while walking or <b>running</b> <b>this</b> bone should have experience more stress fractures than the others. The lack of such a bias in the examined Allosaurus fossils indicates an origin for the stress fractures from a source other than running. The authors conclude that these fractures occurred during interaction with prey, like an allosaur trying to hold struggling prey with its feet. The abundance of stress fractures and avulsion injuries in Allosaurus provide evidence for [...] "very active" [...] predation-based rather than scavenging diets.|$|E
