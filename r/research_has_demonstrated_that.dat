5|$|Both the {{scarcity}} of published archaeological material and the misdating of some sites {{may have contributed to}} the low number of archaeological sites that can be attributed to the Hungarians in the steppes, according to archaeologist László Kovács. Kovács also says that the Hungarians' migration from the steppes and their settlement in the Carpathian Basin may have caused the development of a new material culture, rendering the identification of pre-conquest Hungarians difficult. Archaeological <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> the material culture of the Avars and other steppe peoples who settled in the Carpathian Basin before the Hungarians experienced a similarly significant change after they left the steppes and settled in their new homeland.|$|E

25|$|Machado–Joseph disease (MJD) is a triplet repeat disease {{characterized}} by cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, ophthalmoplegia, and polyneuropathy.

It managed to capture and condense enough ground vapor to bring to life naturally buried seeds underneath it, with a green area of about 10% of the carpet area. It is expected that, if seeds were put down before placing this carpet, a much wider area would become green.|$|E
25|$|Five {{types of}} {{interactions}} between P. colobopterus wasps have been identified. Wasps may antennate, or {{touch each other}} with their antennae. They also demonstrate feeding behavior, where a wasp bearing food will offer the food to another wasp. Wasps may use their mandibles to request a feeding by biting the mandibles of another wasp; additionally, they may use their mandibles to groom another wasp by carefully moving them the mandibles over their nest mate’s body. Finally, wasps may use their mandibles to attack each other by biting another wasp’s body.

25|$|Current genetic <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> humans on the African {{continent}} are {{the most}} genetically diverse. There is more human genetic diversity in Africa than anywhere else on Earth. The genetic structure of Africans was traced to 14 ancestral population clusters. Human genetic diversity decreases in native populations with migratory distance from Africa and this {{is thought to be}} the result of bottlenecks during human migration. Humans have lived in Africa for the longest time, which has allowed accumulation of a higher diversity of genetic mutations in these populations. Only part of Africa's population migrated out of the continent, bringing just part of the original African genetic variety with them. African populations harbor genetic alleles that are not found in other places of the world. All the common alleles found in populations outside of Africa are found on the African continent.|$|E

[...] The brain {{for the most part}} works well when each hemisphere performs its own function while solving a task or problem; the two hemispheres are quite complementary. However, situations arise when the two modes are in conflict, resulting in one hemisphere interfering with the operation of the other hemisphere.|$|E

2500|$|As stated above, {{sulfatide}} {{is predominantly}} {{found in the}} oligodendrocytes and the Schwann cells in the nervous system. When oligodendrocytes are differentiating, sulfatide is first evident in immature oligodendrocytes. [...] However, research suggests that sulfatide has a greater role than simply being a structural component of the membrane. This is because sulfatide is upregulated, i.e.there {{is an increase in}} sulfatide, prior to the myelin sheath being wrapped around the axon, and experiments in cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) deficient mice have shown that sulfatide operates as a negative regulator (inhibitor) of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Accordingly, further <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>demonstrated</b> <b>that</b> when sulfatide is deficient, there is a two to threefold increase in oligodendrocyte differentiation, evidence providing support that sulfatide operates as a negative regulator or inhibitor of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Myelination also appears to be stimulated by sulfatide in the Schwann Cells. Such stimulation is thought to occur through the following interactions. First, sulfatide binds to tenascin-R or laminin in the extracellular matrix, which goes on to bind signaling molecules such as F3 and integrins in the glial membrane. This causes signaling through c-src/fyn kinase. Specifically, the laminin α6β1-integrin forms a complex with fyn kinase and focal adhesion kinase that enables signaling, which, in turn, causes myelination to begin. Sulfatide binding to laminin also causes c-src/fyn kinase activation and initiation of basement membrane formation.|$|E
