40|$|Existing {{second best}} toll pricing (SBTP) models {{determine}} an optimal toll {{for a given}} set of links in a transportation network by minimizing certain system objective, while the traffic flow pattern is assumed to follow user equilibrium (UE). In this paper, we show that such a toll design approach is risk-prone, which tries to optimize for the best-case scenario, if the UE problem has multiple solutions. Accordingly, we propose a risk-averse SBTP approach that aims to optimize for the worst-case scenario. By applying the robust optimization concept, we formulate the risk-averse SBTP as a “min-max ” problem. We establish a general solution existence condition for the risk-averse model, whereas we discuss in detail that such a condition may not be always satisfied in reality. In case a solution does not exist, {{it is possible to}} replace the exact UE solution set by a set of approximate solutions. This <b>replacement</b> <b>guarantees</b> the solution existence of the risk-averse model. We then develop a scheme such that the solution set of an affine UE can be explicitly expressed. Using this explicit representation, an improved simplex method can be adopted to solve the risk-averse SBTP with affine UEs. We illustrate the risk-prone and risk-averse modeling approaches, the explicit expression of affine UEs, and the solution algorithm using a small example. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays that examine incentive problems within various dynamic environments. In Chapter 1, I study the optimal design of a dynamic regulatory system that encourages regulated agents to monitor their activities and voluntarily report their violations. Self-monitoring is a private and costly process, and comprises {{the core of the}} incentive problem. There are no monetary transfers. Instead, the regulator (she) uses future regulatory behavior for incentive provision. When the regulator has full commitment power, she can induce costly self-monitoring and revelation of “bad news” in the initial phase of the optimal policy. During this phase, the agent is promised a higher continuation utility (in the form of future regulatory approval) each time he discloses “bad news”. If the regulator internalizes self-monitoring costs, the agent is either blacklisted or whitelisted in the long run. When she does not internalize these costs, blacklisting is replaced by a temporary probation state, and whitelisting becomes the unique long run outcome. This result suggests that whitelisting, which may appear to be a form of regulatory capture, may instead be a consequence of optimal policy. ^ In Chapter 2, I study the dynamic pricing problem of a durable good monopolist with commitment power, when {{a new version of the}} good is expected at some point in the future. The new version of the good is superior to the existing one, bringing a higher flow utility. The buyers are heterogeneous in terms of their valuations and strategically time their purchases. When the arrival is a stationary stochastic process, the corresponding optimal price path is shown to be constant for both versions of the good, hence there is no delay on purchases and time is not used to discriminate over buyers, which is in line with the literature. However, if the arrival of the new version occurs at a commonly known deterministic date, then the price path may decrease over time, resulting in delayed purchases. For both arrival processes, posted prices is a sub-optimal selling mechanism. The optimal one involves bundling of both versions of the good and selling them only together, which can easily be implemented by selling the initial version of the good with a <b>replacement</b> <b>guarantee.</b> ^ Finally, Chapter 3 examines the question under what conditions can automation be less desirable compared to human labor. We study a firm that has to decide between a human-human team and a human-machine team for production. The effort choice of a human employee is not observed by the manager, therefore the incentives need to be properly aligned. We argue that, despite the desirable benefits resulting from the partial substitution of labor with automated machines such as less costly machine input and reduced scope of moral hazard, the teams with only human employees can, under some conditions, be more preferred over the human-machine teams. This stems from the fact that, in all-human teams, the principal, through the selection of incentive scheme, can control the interaction among the agents and get benefit from the mutual monitoring capacity between them. The automation, however, eliminates this interaction and shuts down a channel that can potentially help to mitigate the overall agency problem. ...|$|E

In this paper, the recovery performance of greedy pursuits with replacement for sparse recovery is analyzed when both the measurement vector and the sensing matrix are contaminated with additive perturbations. Specifi-cally, greedy pursuits with replacement include three algorithms, compressive sampling matching pursuit (CoSaMP), subspace pursuit (SP), and iterative hard thresholding (IHT), where the support estimation is evaluated and updated in each iteration. Based on restricted isometry property, a unified form of the error bounds of these recovery algorithms is derived under general perturbations for compressible signals. The results reveal that the recovery performance is stable against both perturbations. In addition, these bounds are {{compared with that of}} oracle recovery — least squares solution with the locations of some largest entries in magnitude known a priori.

This thesis presents cache mechanisms to improve cache performance and provide opportunities to improve data availability that can lead to more predictable cache performance. The first cache mechanism presented is an intelligent cache replacement policy that utilizes information about dead data and data that is very frequently used. This mechanism is analyzed theoretically to show that the number of misses using intelligent cache <b>replacement</b> is <b>guaranteed</b> to be no more than the number of misses using traditional LRU replacement. Hardware and software-assisted mechanisms to implement intelligent cache replacement are presented and evaluated. The second cache mechanism presented is that of cache partitioning which exploits disjoint access sequences that do not overlap in the memory space. A theoretical result is proven that shows that modifying an access sequence into a concatenation of disjoint access sequences is guaranteed to improve the cache hit rate. Partitioning mechanisms inspired by the concept of disjoint sequences are designed and evaluated. A profit-based analysis, annotation, and simulation framework has been implemented to evaluate the cache mechanisms. This framework takes a compiled benchmark program and a set of program inputs and evaluates various cache mechanisms to provide a range of possible performance improvement scenarios. The proposed cache mechanisms have been evaluated using this framework by measuring cache miss rates and Instructions Per Clock (IPC) information. The results show that the proposed cache mechanisms show promise in improving cache performance and predictability with a modest increase in silicon area. by Prabhat Jain. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{research}} on atherosclerosis therapy is ongoing for decades. This thesis {{is focused on}} lesions where interventional treatment is required, with special focus on stents. For care of late stage atherosclerosis two things are of high importance: first to exclude the diseased tissue and second to renew a healthy surface of endothelial cells. Nowadays, there is no treatment, except for vessel <b>replacement,</b> which <b>guarantees</b> those issues. Addressing those issues I hypothesize that a viable stent structure based on a tissue covered stent will prevent thrombocyte adhesion and hyperplasia. The {{aim of this study}} is to construct a tissue-covered endothelialized stent, the BioStent, and prove the hemocompatibility in vivo. Tissue engineering gives the chance to create new and healthy tissue which can replace the native one where it is damaged. By combining stents with tissue engineering, the stent is surrounded by autologous tissue and therefore on the one hand the foreign object reaction is avoided and on the other hand the damaged tissue is replaced by a new healthy tissue layer. The most important advantage is the endothelial layer with its known and important role of anti-thrombotic and anti-coagulative function, lining the lumen of the stent. For evaluation, different scaffolds (fibrin, elastin-like recombinamers), cell types (endothelial cells, endothelial progenitor cells) and stents (warp knitted, braided) were tested in vitro. For in vivo test, a warp knitted nitinol stent covered with fibrin-gel and EC was implanted in 5 sheep for 3 months. The stent structure was not strong enough to completely expand inside the vessel. Therefore the stents were implanted as interponate for in vivo evaluation. The precrimped BioStent proved to be implantable in carotid position over three months. Furthermore, the important crimping process could be performed without clinical relevant damage. The stent evidenced patency in four of five sheep over the planned implantation time of three months. The tissue analysis showed healthy tissue formation and a confluent endothelial layer orientated to the blood flow...|$|R

Kuzbanian-mediated {{cleavage}} of Notch represents in fact {{one of the fundamental}} steps leading to activation of the Notch pathway during early neurogenesis. This enzyme also plays important roles in later stages of neural development, modulating axon guidance and extension. Planarians are a model system well known for regenerative potential. These characteristics depend on a population of adult stem cells that <b>guarantees</b> <b>replacement</b> of all differentiated cell types, including nerve cells. Here we report the functional characterization of a planarian Kuzbanian-like gene (Smed-kuzbanian 3). Smed-kuzbanian 3 is expressed in the mesenchyme and in the central nervous system (CNS) and is overexpressed during regeneration of this structure. Functional ablation of Smed-kuzbanian 3 by RNAi causes abnormal CNS regeneration. Anomalous eye morphogenesis, including atypical axonal projections of the optic chiasm, is observed. The architecture of the regenerating cephalic ganglia also appears unusual, with an aberrant number and distribution of nerve cells. We speculate that Smed-Kuzbanian 3, similarly to that observed in other organisms, plays different roles during CNS regeneration. To test whether Smed-kuzbanian 3 plays a conserved role during neurogenesis we plan to use Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. Gain of function experiments will allow us to demonstrate the involvement of Smed-kuzbanian 3 in modulating early Notch-mediated lateral inhibition mechanisms and the guidance of axonal extensions at later developmental stages...|$|R

30|$|These {{considerations}} {{suggest that}} it is not the failure of bulbils to recruit new plants, but the comparatively high seed production of Gagea graeca that leads to a high genetic diversity of the populations. Seed production should nevertheless face a limit in arid climates: the more and the earlier in ontogenesis resources will be invested in seeds, the lesser resources remain for the <b>replacement</b> bulb which <b>guarantees</b> survival of the plant. But the relation volume to surface which we must assume to be an important parameter for desiccation tolerance, decreases with decreasing diameter of the bulb. In contrast to G. bulbifera, where bulbs can hold effectively water via sclerophyllous roots (see Levichev 1999), the bulbs of G. graeca lack this adaptation and may thus face a high risk of desiccation during the long Mediterranean summer. This limits the proportion of resources invested into seeds, since plants with large bulbs can be expected to have a higher chance of survival. Indeed, the average size of the bulbils is higher in G. graeca in comparison to G. bulbifera (3 vs. 2.5  mm), and so is the proportion of nitrogen invested into the replacement bulb (62 % vs. 36 %, Table  2). However, figures for relative investment into plant parts cannot be compared directly from two reasons: first, the measurements for G. lutea were obtained at the peak of flowering season, these for G. bulbifera near seed maturation, whereas the measured plants of G. graeca were already completely dried at the time of measurement. Therefore, storage processes may have been not yet completed in the first two species; which should lead to an underestimation of the relative investment into dormant parts (bulbs, bulbils, seeds) but overestimation for vegetative parts in the first two species. Second, G. lutea shows a switch – bulbils and seeds are never found at one plant, which does not allow a direct comparison.|$|R

For the patients with obvious joint swelling and pain, joint puncture and aspiration technique {{should be performed}} under the conditions of factor VIII supplement and strict local disinfection to reduce stress, relieve pain and reduce the damage of hematocele to articular cartilage and bone. To prevent local infection, chronic fistula formation and fatal septicemia, aspiration, drainage and biopsy should not be performed during treatment. For the late phase joint disease, synovectomy, joint irrigation, arthrodesis or arthroplasty should be performed depending on {{the severity of the}} lesions (Auerswald et al. 2012). Replacement therapy is still preferred in systemic treatment. The factor replacement therapy can be divided into preventive treatment and the treatment based on specific needs of the patients. In 1994, WFH (International Federation of Hemophilia) and WHO established the early preventive treatment as the best treatment protocol for pediatric patients with severe hemophilia. Specifically speaking, the systemic therapy includes the following aspects: (1) Replacement therapy: fresh frozen plasma; cryoprecipitate; genetic engineering products of F VIII; F VIII preparations from animal; recombinant activated factor VIIα preparations; prothrombin complex concentrate; FIX preparations with high purity. (2) Medication-assisted therapy: ranitidine, desmopressin, danazol, antifibrinolytic agents and carbazochrome salicylate. (3) Spleen cell transplantation or spleen transplantation. (4) Gene therapy. Since 1970 s, the morbidity and mortality of hemophilia has been greatly reduced with the effective application of replacement treatment. Since 1980 s, the safety of <b>replacement</b> treatment is <b>guaranteed</b> with the continuous improvement of virus inactivation technology, thereby greatly reducing the incidence of viral hepatitis and AIDS in hemophilia. Since the 1990 s, the widespread application of recombinant coagulation factors not only improves the efficacy, but also avoids the side effects of antibody production and viral infection caused by the application of traditional human-derived clotting factors. Gene therapy achieves success in animal trials. The results of gene therapy in preliminary clinical trials also bring hope to hemophilia patients (High 2014).|$|R
40|$|An online {{social network}} {{can be defined}} as a set of {{socially}} relevant individuals with some patterns of interactions or contacts among them, which are connected by one or more online relations [1][2]. Online social networks provide platforms for users to share information or statuses and to communicate with their families and friends online. These complex, emergent, dynamic and heterogeneous networks have been developed on an unprecedented scale. With the prosperous development of online social networks, many marketers have exploited the opportunities and attempt to select influential users within online social media to influence other users through online ?word-of-mouth? effect or viral marketing approaches, which are now replacing traditional marketing strategies [3]. Such ?word-of-mouth? effect and viral marketing approaches can enhance brand awareness and achieve the marketing objectives of companies with limited resources. In this situation, the propagation of influence to online users with limited resources over the largest possible range, known as influence maximisation, is an important problem. The solution of influence maximisation is known to be NP-hard. Hence, approximation approaches are better <b>replacements</b> with <b>guarantee</b> [4][5][6]. This thesis explores appropriate approaches for solving the influence maximisation problem effectively and efficiently. Based on the existing problems of influence maximisation in online social networks, influence maximisation is developed through two different approaches; centralised and decentralised. In centralised approaches, all tasks are completed by a single central component. By contrast, decentralised approaches share the workload by distributing the computational tasks to individuals. Classic influence diffusion models with static and predefined probabilities are too ideal, as they consider only the physical link connections [3][5], whereas online social networks contain additional subjective factors, such as, user preference. User preference {{plays an important role in}} influence maximisation, but is not considered in most of the existing influence maximisation models. To alleviate these problems, we proposed a Preference-based Trust Independent Cascade Model, which is founded on a classic centralised approach. This develops influence maximisation in terms of both user preference and trust connection (physical link connection). Based on these two factors, the Preference-based Trust Independent Cascade Model computes the influence propagation probabilities. In this way, hub users in an online social network, who are interested in the promoted items, can be selected as influential users. In experimental results, the Preference-based Trust Independent Cascade Model demonstrated better performance than other existing approaches. Furthermore, by reviewing the previous researches and implementing experiments, we discover that centralised approaches are generally inefficient because they limit the stability and scalability of large-scale, dynamic online social networks. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel decentralised approach called Stigmergy-based Influence Maximisation Model, which simulates the influence propagation process by ants crawling across the network topology. The model mimics the key behaviours of ants, i. e., path selection and pheromone allocation. The former identifies the next node to reach when an ant faces multiple options; the latter deposits pheromone on the specific nodes based on the heuristics when an ant explores a possible influence-diffusion path. The superior performance and operating time of the Stigmergy-based Influence Maximisation Model was confirmed in comparison experiments against existing approaches...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Humboldt State University, Sociology, 2012 The U. S. {{military}} of the Vietnam era was a {{total institution}} of the Goffman school, set apart from larger American society, whose often forcibly inducted personnel underwent a transformative process from citizen to soldier. Comprised of {{a large group of}} individuals, with a common purpose, with a clear distinction between officers and enlisted, and regulated by a single authority, Goffman???s formulation as presented in the 1950 ???s has become a basic tenet of military sociology. The overwhelming evidence is clear: perhaps the best equipped army in history faced a debacle on the battlefield and cracked under minimal stress due to the internal rotation structure which was not resolved until the withdrawal of U. S. forces: the ???fixed length tour???. Throughout the Vietnam War the duration of the tour in the combat theater was set at 12 months for Army enlisted, 13 months for Marine enlisted - officer ranks in both branches served six months in combat, six months on staff duty. 	The personnel turbulence generated by the ???fixed length??? combat tour and the finite Date of Estimated Return from Overseas (DEROS) created huge demands for replacement manpower among both enlisted and junior grade officers at the company and platoon level. It has been argued that just as a man was learning the ropes of combat in the jungles of Vietnam he was rotated out of the theater of operations. The logistical and training cycle implications aside, the loss of combat experience through the individual replacement system had an effect on morale, cohesion, and discipline of units at every echelon. The stress of losing so many key personnel to rotation was most devastating to the primary combat groups at rifle platoon and infantry company level, which shouldered the majority of combat. The basic hypotheses I wish to state are as follows: 1. 	The U. S. Army in Vietnam underwent a rapid disintegration separate from social forces at work on the home front, and not due to traditional stresses of combat such as heavy casualties. 2. 	The U. S. Army in Vietnam disintegrated because of internal personnel ???turbulence??? created by far reaching complications caused by loss of experienced soldiers due to rotation on completion of the ???fixed length tour??? of duty. The manpower requirements created by the DEROS and ???fixed length tour??? system were the key structural element undermining the cohesion of US forces in the field. 3. 	Crimes against civilians, and mass killings such as My Lai, are a symptom of this systemic disintegration just as drugs, race riots, fragging, and mutiny: produced by the loss of military normative order due the ???fixed length tour??? and DEROS. 	This policy had far reaching consequences across the entire institution: 1. 	First and foremost, units deploying to Vietnam had a lifespan of exactly one calendar year. After the initial deployment and rotation cycle units lost their experienced cadre, and virtually all institutional memory - most critically at the primary group level within Infantry companies in combat. Units deploying to Vietnam also lost many key senior enlisted men who had served prior tours with other units {{due to the fact that}} they were no longer eligible for compulsory Vietnam service. 2. 	Second, and perhaps most critically officer ranks rotating at twice the rate of enlisted men created an upside down power dynamic in which inexperienced commanders were often placed in command of units already in combat. This often led to a crisis of legitimacy as those with the power of rank at every level led and issued orders to units comprised of alienated subordinates, who, though compelled to serve often had more field experience. 3. 	Third, the cascading eligible manpower shortage forced shortened training cycles, which were diluted in quality and increasingly brutalizing in nature. The realities of the war bore very little resemblance to what soldiers had been trained for or led to expect prior to Vietnam where it was difficult to distinguish friend from foe. The most vicious of institutional memories were retained, culminating in the universality of the racist ???gook syndrome??? and the liberalization of unofficial field Rules of Engagement (ROE) as the ???Mere Gook Rule. ??? 4. 	Fourth the individual <b>replacement</b> system <b>guaranteed</b> that the most inexperienced soldiers were often placed in combat units - as they were the largest body of troops eligible for deployment to replace personnel losses due to rotation or combat. Soldiers trained and worked with a known primary group stateside - building cohesion - yet were assigned individually to deployed combat units, on which they were then dependent for orientation, integration, and hopefully, survival. 		The far reaching anomie created by this unresolved structural cycle brought about an eventual system-wide failure, as the loss of normative order and cognitive dissonance it engendered among era servicemen increasingly resulted in the disintegration of the U. S. military units in Vietnam. The historical identity image of the hallowed military institutions involved were no longer consonant with those of the average soldier serving in the jungles and rice paddies of South East Asia. As a result, the U. S. military as an organization became anomic and mutable, resulting in adaptive instability at every level. Many professionally trained, would-be career soldiers became disillusioned and left the service - becoming a mechanism for institutional change that is still traceable today. Never has such a massive institution changed so much in such a short period of time - largely from symptoms arising from self imposed internal structures - a fatal flaw which compounded all other dependent factors. In this respect the U. S. military in Vietnam offers a unique opportunity to study sweeping and sudden social change in a total institution...|$|R
