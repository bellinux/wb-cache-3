50|$|He is {{what follows}} {{in the hole}} left behind by Iron Man once Tony Stark leaves the world stage. Tony hasn't been around to protect the regular {{interests}} {{that he might have}} during his time <b>running</b> <b>Stark</b> Industries or <b>running</b> S.H.I.E.L.D. And now that he's back, he's made it clear he doesn't want {{to get back into the}} geo-political side of things necessarily. Detroit Steel is what happens in that absence. He is a sort of Blackwater-meets-NASCAR corporate-sponsored armored enhanced guy available for hire to the highest bidder for whatever cause around the round. Basically, Iron Man's worst nightmare of what he could become. An absolute perversion of everything he is.|$|R

40|$|The {{goal with}} {{this project was}} to develop a graphic {{template}} for a new magazine about <b>running,</b> <b>STARK</b> Löpning. Besides the looks of the graphic elements, sections in the magazine would be developed. Finally, a discussion is made about how the magazine can be remade into an electronic format. Content analyses has been made regarding magazines with both a main and a specific orientation, to review the graphic relationship between them. A content  analysis regarding a competing magazine about running was also made. An unstructured interview was done with Art Director Petrus Iggström, to find out his way of working when he creates new graphic templates for magazines. The discussion concerning the electronic format was done based on previous research in the subject. The graphic relationship between main and specific magazines turned out to not be significant, they had few similarities. It was often showed that elements regarding the magazine s’identity had been changed, for example text fonts. This could be because the specific magazines are sighted towards a different target audience than the main magazine, and therefor wants an identity of its own. It’s an easy process to remake the magazines STARK Magasin and STARK Löpning into an electronic format, but none of the services that were looked closely upon in this essay were fitting for both passive and active readers. Nor did the services have a good enough browsing feature. For example, if the reader wants to read an article that was advertised on the cover page, {{it was not possible to}} go directly to the article from the cover...|$|R

60|$|By {{this time}} they'd {{got to the}} front door, at which was now {{standing}} Tony's buggy and servant; Greenough was going to walk to his lodgings, and Blake {{had come to the}} door to see his friend off; when they heard a loud shrieking down the street, and they saw the unfortunate <b>Stark</b> <b>running</b> towards the hotel, still followed by Fitzpatrick and Dillon, each with an empty bottle in his hand.|$|R
50|$|Early on 1 January 1993, {{knowing that}} his time is quickly <b>running</b> out, <b>Starks</b> is briefly {{taken out of}} the {{hospital}} by Dr. Beth Lorenson, who he has finally convinced of his time travel experiences and his knowledge of future events. She drives Starks to the home of Jackie and her mother, where he gives the mother a letter he has written, which outlines Jackie's bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a cigarette and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks slips on the ice and hits his head. Bleeding profusely, he convinces two of the more sympathetic doctors to put him into the jacket one last time.|$|R
60|$|Indeed no one {{can express}} the joy of these poor creatures on this occasion: fear and grief are easily set forth; sighs and tears, with a few motions of the hands and head, are all the demonstrations of these passions; but an excess of joy, carries in it a {{thousand}} extravagancies; especially, I think, among the French, whose temper is allowed to be more volatile, passionate, sprightly, and gay, than that of other nations. Some were weeping, tearing themselves in the greatest agonies of sorrow, and <b>running</b> <b>stark</b> mad about the ship, while the rest were stamping with their feet, wringing their hands, singing, laughing, swooning away, vomiting, fainting, with a few returning hearty thanks to the Almighty; and crossing themselves. I think, if I am not mistaken, our surgeon was obliged to let thirty of them blood. But among the passengers, there were two priests, the one an old, {{and the other a}} young man; but what amazed me more was, that the oldest was in the worst plight; for no sooner did he perceive himself freed from danger, but he dropt down as it were without life, and to every one's appearance quite dead; but the surgeon chasing and rubbing his arm, opened a vein, which at first dropped, and then flowing more freely, the old man began to open his eyes; and in {{a quarter of an hour}} was well again. But soon remembering this happy change, the joy of which whirled his blood about faster than the vessels could convey it, he became so feverish, as made him more fit for bedlam than any other place. But the surgeon giving him a sleepy dose, he was perfectly composed the next morning.|$|R

5|$|The Bulls {{were led}} offensively by the triple threat of quarterback Drew Willy, <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks,</b> and wide {{receiver}} Namaan Roosevelt. The three combined to break 14single-season school records, including most points scored in a season (404). Willy, heading into his final game as a Buffalo Bull, had already surpassed the 3,000-yard mark in passing on the season, throwing for 25touchdowns against only fiveinterceptions.

50|$|Washington got {{the ball}} to start the third, and got into field goal range again. This time, they tested Potter from 50 yards, and he was well wide of the mark, and Green Bay took {{possession}} again. Green Bay would continue {{to take it to}} Washington, as Rodgers connected with Nelson once more, to make it 31-0 Green Bay. Washington {{got the ball}} back and was finally able to respond, with quarterback Robert Griffin III connecting with Pierre Garçon for a 6-yard score to cut the deficit to 31-7. Any hopes of a comeback were stumped out, however, when Packers <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks</b> raced past defenders into the end zone for a 32-yard score to put the advantage up to 38-7.|$|R

Instead, Frey carried the ball out of the end zone, was hit at the 4-yard line, and fumbled. Buffalo recovered and promptly scored on a 4-yard touchdown run by Bull <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks,</b> giving themselves a 20–10 lead. UConn had committed its fifth fumble of the game, four of which were recovered by Buffalo. All of Buffalo's 20 points were directly off of UConn turnovers.|$|R

5000|$|Stark's health {{continues}} to deteriorate, and he discovers the armor's cybernetic interface is causing irreversible {{damage to his}} nervous system. His condition is aggravated by a failed attempt on his life by Kathy Dare, a mentally unbalanced former lover, which injures his spine, paralyzing him. Stark has a nerve chip implanted into his spine to regain his mobility. Stark's nervous system continues its slide towards failure, and he constructs a [...] "skin" [...] made up of artificial nerve circuitry to assist it. Stark begins to pilot a remote-controlled Iron Man armor, but {{when faced with the}} Masters of Silence, the telepresence suit proves inadequate. Stark designs a more heavily armed version of the suit to wear, the [...] "Variable Threat Response Battle Suit", which becomes known as the War Machine armor. Ultimately, the damage to his nervous system becomes too extensive. Faking his death, Stark places himself in suspended animation to heal as Rhodes takes over both the <b>running</b> of <b>Stark</b> Enterprises and the mantle of Iron Man, although he uses the War Machine armor. Stark makes a full recovery by using a chip to reprogram himself and resumes the Iron Man identity. When Rhodes learns that Stark has manipulated his friends by faking his own death, he becomes enraged and the two friends part ways, Rhodes continuing as War Machine in a solo career.|$|R
50|$|The Packers {{were forced}} to a three-and-out on their next drive, but this time their defense managed {{to step up and}} make a big play. Early in the second quarter, cornerback Tramon Williams intercepted the ball from Kaepernick and {{returned}} it 17 yards to the Green Bay 30-yard line. After the turnover, Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers completed six of seven passes for 45 yards as the team went 70 yards and 14 plays on a drive in which they never gained more than nine yards on a single play. Rodgers capped it off with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson that gave the Packers a 7-6 lead. In a notable contrast, the 49ers quickly struck back, scoring with just five plays as Kaepernick took off for a 42-yard gallop to set up Gores touchdown on a 10-yard run. Green Bay responded with Rodgers completing a 19-yard pass to Nelson and a 13-yarder to <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks</b> on a 59-yard drive that ended with Mason Crosbys 34-yard field goal as time expired in the half, making the score 13-10 at halftime.|$|R
50|$|With their Super Bowl XLV {{championship}} {{title to}} defend, the Green Bay Packers began their 2011 {{campaign against the}} previous champion (Super Bowl XLIV champion), the New Orleans Saints in the annual NFL Kickoff Game. Green Bay delivered the game's opening punch {{in the first quarter}} as reigning Super Bowl MVP Aaron Rodgers found wide receiver Greg Jennings on a 7-yard touchdown pass, followed by wide receiver Jordy Nelson on a 3-yard touchdown pass. The Saints answered with quarterback Drew Brees completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Meachem, yet the Packers came right back with Rodgers hooking up rookie wide receiver Randall Cobb on a 32-yard touchdown pass. It was Cobb's first career catch as well as touchdown, despite running the wrong route, later revealed by Rodgers. New Orleans crawled their way back in the second quarter as kicker John Kasay got a 30-yard field goal, followed by running back Darren Sproles returning a punt 72 yards for a touchdown. Afterwards, Green Bay struck back with a 17-yard touchdown run from <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, a 32-yard burst by Packers <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks</b> sparked a 57-yard drive that ended with Crosbys 48-yard field goal, putting Green Bay up 19-7. Green Bay seemed {{in control of the}} game now, {{especially}} when Wilson threw his fourth interception of the day, this one to Burnett, giving the Packers the ball at their 43-yard line with just over five minutes left in regulation. However, Seattles defense made a crucial stand. Three carries by Eddie Lacy resulted in a tackle by Kevin Williams for a 4-yard loss, a tackle by Michael Bennett for a 2-yard loss, and a 2-yard gain. Green Bay had forced Seattle to use two timeouts, but they punted the ball back after running just 1:12 off the clock. Taking the ball back on their 31-yard line with 3:52 left, Seattle running back Marshawn Lynch started the drive with a 14-yard run. Then Wilson hooked up with Baldwin for a 20-yard completion, and later connected with Lynch for a 26-yard gain. Two plays later, Wilson scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, trimming Green Bays lead to 19-14.|$|R
50|$|The {{previous}} {{season was}} a disappointing {{one for the}} UB Bulls: Following 2008's MAC Championship, UB was expected to challenge for the conference championship again in 2009. But before the season even started, bad luck struck the team as star <b>running</b> back James <b>Starks</b> injured the labrum in his left shoulder in a pre-season scrimmage. It was determined that he would need surgery and miss the whole year. The offense also struggled without four-year starting quarterback Drew Willy as new starter Zach Maynard had an up-and-down season. The defense was unable to force as many turnovers {{as it did in}} 2008 and still struggled to stop opposing offenses as coach Turner Gill's decision to replace defensive coordinator Jimmy Williams with defensive back coach Fred Reed did not pay off. The team was out of MAC championship and bowl contention by mid-season and finished 5-7. Despite the setback, Gill was hired away by Kansas. Two weeks after Gill left, UB announced the hiring of Quinn, the offensive coordinator for the then-undefeated and 3rd ranked Cincinnati Bearcats football team. In the Sugar Bowl the Bearcats lost to the Florida Gators.|$|R
50|$|The Packers {{received}} the opening kickoff and stormed 81 yards needing only 7 plays with James <b>Starks</b> <b>running</b> in a 3-yard touchdown. The drive was so efficient they didn't even face a third down. As {{a sign of}} things to come, the Falcons struck right back with a 4-yard Steven Jackson touchdown run to end a 72-yard drive. The Packers, as they did often, answered the Falcons with another touchdown of their own. Showing off their ability to kill the clock with long drives, the Packers used 13 plays and over 7 minutes to go 80 yards with Lacy running in his second touchdown of the game on the first play of the second quarter. After a Falcons three-and-out the Packers again worked the clock, driving 80 yards in just under six minutes, but the Falcons defense made a rare stand and Crosby kicked a field goal. Morgan Burnett intercepted Matt Ryan on their next possession and returned it 32 yards to the Falcons 15. Four plays later Rodgers threw a 1-yard touchdown pass to Lacy. The Falcons offense continued to sputter as they punted. The Packers stayed hot with Rodgers hitting Nelson for a 10-yard touchdown with twenty-four {{seconds left in the}} half. The Falcons managed to reach field goal range with the big play being a Ryan 30-yard bomb to Julio Jones. However, Brad Jones blocked Matt Bryant's 53-yard field goal attempt, leaving the score 31-7 at halftime. The Falcons busted out in the third quarter. On the first play from scrimmage Ryan launched a pass to Jones for 79 yards the Packers 3-yard line. However, they lost two yards on their next three plays, but on fourth-and-goal from the 5-yard line Ryan threw a 5-yard touchdown pass to Eric Weems, trimming the score to 31-14. After a Packers punt the Falcons reached the Packers 31, but were forced to settle for a 50-yard field goal. The Packers added a field goal on their next drive, the Falcons mimicked the Packers clock-killing strategy (possibly, ultimately to their detriment) taking six-and-a-half minutes off the clock as they traveled 72 yards with Ryan dropping a 22-yard touchdown pass into the hands of Jones who had the best game of his career. However, Rodgers and the Packers offense regrouped and stormed 74 yards in a mere 4 plays with Rodgers hitting his number one guy Nelson for a 60-yard touchdown pass. The Falcons' Rashede Hageman blocked Crosby's PAT keeping the deficit two scores at 40-24. The shootout continued as the Falcons answered right back with Ryan lobbing a 1-yard touchdown pass to Roddy White, but the two point conversion failed which would prove critical as the score remained 40-30. The Falcons onside kick attempt failed, but they didn't allow a first down, keeping them in the game as Crosby nailed a 53-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 43-30. Ryan continued to shred the Packers defense, darting a 2-yard touchdown pass to Harry Douglas, making the score 43-37 and giving the Falcons a chance to pull of the improbable comeback. However, a 41-yard run by James Starks enabled the Packers to run out the clock and hold on for the win.|$|R
