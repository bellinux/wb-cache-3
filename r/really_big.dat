5|$|A {{scene in}} the episode shows Grampa and Bart driving to Branson with Marge's car, {{listening}} to the radio. Because the scene consists entirely of auditive gags, the Simpsons staff had difficulty figuring out what to show visually during the scene. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, Jean explained that these scenes “get a <b>really</b> <b>big</b> laugh at the table,” but are subsequently hard for the animators. The scene makes use of a repeated background, an animation technique made famous by Hanna-Barbera in order to cut budget.|$|E

Since such a board can be constructed by pushing together four standard 8×8 boards, Betza also gave this variant the alternative names of Four Board Chess or Chess on Four Boards.|$|E

On 8 February 1906 Sonnino formed his first government, which lasted only three months; on 18 May 1906, after a mere 100 days, he was forced to resign. He proposed major changes to transform Southern Italy, which provoked opposition from the ruling groups.

His reforms provoked opposition from the ruling groups. He was succeeded by Giovanni Giolitti.|$|E
25|$|The {{conventional}} reel or trolling reel {{is similar}} to the baitcasting reel. There are two types of trolling reels, star drag reels and lever drag reels. Star drag reels are like baitcasters, but you move a little lever to put it into free spool. They have a star drag and you have to keep your thumb on them to keep off backlash. The lever drag reel uses the drag to put itself into free spool. It is very difficult to cast a conventional reel, most oven line is dropped behind a boat and left to drift. Conventional reels are for <b>really</b> <b>big</b> fish and are usually used offshore. They are designed for trolling but can also be used for butterfly jigging and Deep-sea fishing ("deep drop"). They are mounted on short rods.|$|E
