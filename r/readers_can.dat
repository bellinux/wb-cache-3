5|$|Philo of Alexandria, Josephus and Seneca {{state that}} Caligula was insane, but {{describe}} this madness as a personality trait {{that came through}} experience. Seneca states that Caligula became arrogant, angry and insulting once becoming emperor and uses his personality flaws as examples his <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> learn from. According to Josephus, power made Caligula incredibly conceited and led him {{to think he was}} a god. Philo of Alexandria reports that Caligula became ruthless after nearly dying of an illness in the eighth month of his reign in AD 37. Juvenal reports he was given a magic potion that drove him insane.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} places where an {{editorial}} hand appears absent altogether. Neologisms are continually coined, and sentences are paragraph-long and convoluted. Biography, history, propaganda, science, science fiction, and cinema are intertwined {{in the most}} confusing way. Perhaps {{the idea is to}} induce a slightly dissociated state, so that <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> be lulled into belief. If one did not already possess some background, this book would give no lucid history of anthropology or primatology.|$|E

25|$|Unauthorized {{reading of}} RFID tags {{presents}} {{a risk to}} privacy. Unauthorized <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> potentially use RFID information to identify or track packages, consumers, carriers, or {{the contents of a}} package. Several prototype systems are being developed to combat unauthorized reading, including RFID signal interruption, as well as the possibility of legislation, and 700 scientific papers have been published on this matter since 2002. There are also concerns that the database structure of Object Naming Services may be susceptible to infiltration, similar to denial-of-service attacks, after the EPCglobal Network ONS root servers were shown to be vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|The Oyster card has a claimed {{proximity}} {{range of}} about 80mm (3inches). The card {{operates as a}} RFID system and is compatible with ISO/IEC 14443 types A and B. Oyster <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> also read other types of cards including Cubic Transportation Systems' Go cards. From its inception until January 2010, Oyster cards were based on NXP/Philips' MIFARE Classic 1k chips provided by Giesecke & Devrient, Gemalto and SchlumbergerSema. All new Oyster cards have used MIFARE DESFire EV1 chips since December 2009. From February 2010, MIFARE Classic-based Oyster cards were no longer issued. MIFARE DESFire cards are now widely used as transport smartcards.|$|E
25|$|In {{the rest}} of the book Ehrlich {{discusses}} things which <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> do to help. This is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests, which he believed were not politically possible in 1968. At {{the end of the book}} he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong, a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist. However, he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions, so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action.|$|E

25|$|Never Again! – A Hong Kong AIDS Foundation 15th Anniversary Commemorative Publication on Discrimination Against HIV and AIDS (Traditional Chinese: 「筆載」歧視—香港愛滋病歧視個案結集) is a Chinese {{documentary}} book on AIDS Discrimination {{published by the}} Foundation in April 2006. It puts together 9 real cases of AIDS discrimination from 1991 to 2006, in which <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> discover how the AIDS infected {{as well as their}} family members fought back against discrimination from outsiders. This book also reveals the hardship faced by the Foundation while it strives for equality for the AIDS infected throughout these years. So far 4000 copies of the book were published and distributed.|$|E
25|$|A primary RFID {{security}} {{concern is}} the illicit tracking of RFID tags. Tags, which are world-readable, pose a risk to both personal location privacy and corporate/military security. Such concerns have been raised {{with respect to the}} United States Department of Defense's recent adoption of RFID tags for supply chain management. More generally, privacy organizations have expressed concerns in the context of ongoing efforts to embed electronic product code (EPC) RFID tags in consumer products. This is mostly as result of the fact that RFID tags can be read, and legitimate transactions with <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> be eavesdropped, from non-trivial distances. RFID used in access control, payment and eID (e-passport) systems operate at a shorter range than EPC RFID systems but are also vulnerable to skimming and eavesdropping, albeit at shorter distance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are mixed}} results in how {{important}} phonological information is to deaf individuals when reading {{and when that}} information is obtained. Alphabets, abugidas, abjads, and syllabaries all seem to require the reader/writer {{to know something about}} the phonology of their target language prior to learning the system. Profoundly deaf children {{do not have access to}} the same auditory base that hearing children do. Orally trained deaf children do not always use phonological information in reading tasks, word recognition tasks or homophonic tasks; however, deaf signers who are not orally trained do utilize phonological information in word-rhyming tasks. Furthermore when performing on tasks with phonologically confusable initial sounds, hearing readers made more errors than deaf readers. Yet when given sentences that are sublexically confusable when translated into ASL, deaf readers made more errors than hearing readers. The body of literature clearly shows that skilled deaf <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> employ phonological skills, even if they don’t all the time; without additional longitudinal studies it is uncertain if a profoundly deaf person must know something about the phonology of the target language to become a skilled reader (less than 75% of the deaf population) or if by becoming a skilled reader a deaf person learns how to employ phonological skills of the target language.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{features}} less of Jennifer {{than the}} film, but does capture her [...] "going {{in for the}} kill" [...] several times. It focuses heavily on following her soon-to-be victims and provides information on their personalities not elaborated on in the film so that <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> better conclude whether the boys deserved to be murdered. The novel consists of four chapters, with a prologue and an epilogue, with art provided for each by different artists. Each one follows a different boy and {{what is happening in}} his life just before Jennifer kills him.|$|E
500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, García Márquez noted:In every book I {{try to make a}} different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen. I only respond to our way of life, the life of the Caribbean.|$|E
500|$|Brisingr {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews, with critical reviewers {{commenting on the}} book's length and Paolini's growing maturity in his treatment of characters. David Durham of the Washington Post gave the novel a moderately negative review, praising Paolini for his streamlined prose, but said the novel loses focus in the middle. He added, though, that Brisingr [...] "reconnects with the core elements that animate Eragon's tale" [...] {{toward the end of}} the book, and Paolini shows growing maturity during some [...] "quiet" [...] moments in Brisingr, although Durham noted these parts could bore younger readers. Durham also found that Paolini's new characters are original, and that Paolini added depth to some characters from the previous novels in the Inheritance Cycle. In contrast, Sheena McFarland of The Salt Lake Tribune said that Paolini [...] "hasn't learned how to create characters that <b>readers</b> <b>can</b> relate to," [...] although she praised him for strong female characters in Brisingr such as Arya and Nasuada. McFarland calls the last fifty pages [...] "riveting", but says they are a [...] "paltry reward for trudging through the 700 preceding pages." ...|$|E
