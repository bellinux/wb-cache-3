About 18percent of the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> live in areas that have a high urban influence (roughly 12.9 people per square kilometre), many working in the main urban area. Rural areas with moderate urban influence and a population density of about 6.5people per square kilometre account for 26percent of the <b>rural</b> <b>population.</b> Areas with low urban influence {{where the majority of}} the residents work in the rural area house approximately 42percent of the <b>rural</b> <b>population.</b> Remote rural areas with a density of less than 1 person per square kilometre account for about 14percent of the <b>rural</b> <b>population.</b>|$|E

5|$|The city {{authorities}} {{proceeded to}} punish severely {{the leaders of}} the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of the peace of Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked down hard on the <b>rural</b> <b>population.</b> The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations. The peace of the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League. The <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or to hard labour on galleys, or exiled. Christian Schybi was executed at Sursee on July 9, 1653. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League. Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 death sentences were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in courts-martial by von Erlach's army, compared to eight and seven death sentences in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.|$|E

Those whose landholdings exceeded the limit saw their property requisitioned by the government without compensation. The Afghan leadership believed the reform would meet with popular approval among the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> while weakening the power of the bourgeoisie. The reform was declared complete in mid-1979 and the government proclaimed that 665,000 hectares (approximately 1,632,500 acres) had been redistributed. The government also declared that only 40,000 families, or 4 percent of the population, had been negatively affected by the land reform.|$|E
5|$|The Planning Commission {{estimates}} {{the poverty rate}} of all North East Indian states by using head count ratio of Assam (the largest state in North East India).

However, Tripura government's independent assessment, based on consumption distribution data, reported that, in 2001, 55 per cent of the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> was below the poverty line. Geographic isolation and communication bottleneck coupled with insufficient infrastructure have restricted economic growth of the state. High rate of poverty and unemployment continues to be prevalent.|$|E
5|$|Although the Quiriguá elite {{were clearly}} Maya in ethnicity, the site {{lies on the}} {{southern}} periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi-ethnic, with ethnic Maya in a minority.

The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer (1040 to 1300 per square mile) in the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 12001600; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer (338 per square mile) at the site, compared with 1449 structures/km2 (3767 per square mile) in central Copán.

5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the economic pressure on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|During Madagascar's First Republic, France heavily {{influenced}} Madagascar's economic planning and policy {{and served as}} its key trading partner. Key products were cultivated and distributed nationally through producers' and consumers' cooperatives. Government initiatives such as a rural development program and state farms were established to boost production of commodities such as rice, coffee, cattle, silk and palm oil. Popular dissatisfaction over these policies was {{a key factor in}} launching the socialist-Marxist Second Republic, in which the formerly private bank and insurance industries were nationalized; state monopolies were established for such industries as textiles, cotton and power; and import–export trade and shipping were brought under state control. Madagascar's economy quickly deteriorated as exports fell, industrial production dropped by 75percent, inflation spiked and government debt increased; the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> was soon reduced to living at subsistence levels. Over 50percent of the nation's export revenue was spent on debt servicing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the peasant war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to {{the places where the}} leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did the singing of the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor the memories of the event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the <b>rural</b> <b>population</b> kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} {{campylobacter}} infection in Scotland {{over five years}} (1978 - 82), during which 7808 human isolates were recorded (mean annual isolation rate of 30 per 100000), revealed differences in the epidemiology of the disease between <b>rural</b> and urban <b>populations</b> which were not apparent in the national data. The incidence of infection in the two rural areas studied was greatest {{in the early months}} of the year, whereas that in the two urban areas showed a third-quarter predominance. In both urban and <b>rural</b> <b>populations,</b> age-specific infection rates were highest in children less than 5 years old, but this trend was more pronounced in <b>rural</b> than urban <b>populations.</b> Conversely, secondary peaks in age-specific infection rates observed in young adults were more pronounced in the urban than <b>rural</b> <b>populations.</b> It is postulated that rural children were being infected by campylobacters at an early age by drinking contaminated raw milk which was not normally available to city residents. The lower incidence in adults in the <b>rural</b> <b>populations</b> is interpreted as indicating more widespread immunity, resulting from greater exposure to infection during childhood. The effect of compulsory heat treatment of milk sold in Scotland, introduced in August 1983, is currently being studied...|$|R
