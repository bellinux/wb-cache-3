30|$|There {{is a need}} {{to explore}} more {{sustainable}} approaches to water management on the Canadian Prairies. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option that would reduce water stress during drought periods by providing water for irrigation. The <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting local farm surface water <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analyzed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and upkeep cost, and economic advantage to farmers when used for irrigation. While irrigation application increased crop revenue, the cost of irrigation and reservoir infrastructure and installation costs were too high for the farmer to experience a positive net revenue. Farmers who harvest cattails from <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $ 642.70 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $ 7014 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $ 17, 730 –$ 18, 470 /hectare of retention system/year. The recommended use of <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> is for avoided flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. The revenue gained from these functions can support farmers wanting to invest in irrigation while providing economic and environmental benefits to the region.|$|R

Investing in multiple on-farm multi-purpose <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> also has the potential to provide environmental and social benefits to the province of Manitoba. The reductions in phosphorus and nitrogen multi-purpose <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> provide can aid in Manitoba’s goal of reducing nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations by 50 % to Lake Winnipeg (Government of Manitoba 2014).

The use of dental implants for replacing missing teeth {{is going to be}} a safe technique and the implant-prosthetic materials give the possibility of having long-term clinical success. Aim of this work is to evaluate the mechanical features of three different prosthetic <b>retention</b> <b>systems.</b> By applying engineering systems of investigations like FEM and von Mises analyses, how the dental implant material holds out against the masticatory strength during the chewing cycles has been investigated. Three common dental implant overdenture <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> have been investigated. The ball attachment system, the locator system, and the common dental abutment have been processed by Ansys Workbench 15. 0 and underwent FEM and von Mises investigations. The elastic features of the materials used in the study have been taken from recent literature data. Results revealed different response for both types of device, although locator system showed better results for all conditions of loading. The data of this virtual model show all the features of different prosthetic <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> under the masticatory load.

40|$|Regions {{dependent}} on agricultural production {{are concerned about}} the uncertainty associated with climate change. Extreme drought and flooding events are predicted to occur with greater frequency, requiring mitigation strategies to reduce the associated negative impacts. Retention pond installation schemes designed to capture surface water may be a viable option to reduce water stress during drought periods by supporting irrigation. The <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> would serve to capture excess spring runoff and extreme rainfall events, reducing flood potential downstream. Additionally, retention ponds may be used for biomass production and nutrient retention. The purpose of this research was to investigate the economic viability of adopting on-farm surface water <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> as a strategic water management strategy. A retention pond was analysed using a dynamic simulation model to predict its storage capacity, installation and upkeep cost, and economic advantages. The average impact of irrigation application under present day conditions was an increase in crop revenue of $ 11. 38 /hectare. However, due to the cost of irrigation and reservoir installation this on average leaves the farmer to pay $ 148. 50 /hectare each year. Replacing existing low value crops within the study area with high value potato crops also resulted in a negative net revenue. Irrigated crops under future climate scenarios also experienced a net decrease in revenue due to the associated irrigation and reservoir infrastructure costs. However, gross crop revenue increases were more consistent throughout the future study time periods and required less irrigation water, making irrigation application more beneficial in the future. Farmers who harvest cattails from <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> for biomass and available carbon offset credits can gain $ 642. 70 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. Cattail harvest also removes phosphorus and nitrogen, providing a monetized impact of $ 7, 014 /hectare of harvestable cattail/year. The removal of phosphorus, nitrogen, carbon, and avoided flooding damages of the retention basin itself provide an additional $ 17, 850 to $ 18, 470 /hectare of retention system/year depending on the valuations of avoided flooding damages. The recommended use of <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> is for avoiding flood damages, nutrient retention, and biomass production. This is due to the economic gains these three functions of <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> provide.

30|$|The {{creation}} of local farm water <b>retention</b> <b>systems,</b> designed {{to capture and}} store surface water, may be a viable adaptation strategy (Pavelic et al. 2012). Local farm water <b>retention</b> <b>systems</b> allow for the detainment of water captured during spring runoff as well as during precipitation events, either directly or due to transport by surface runoff. This provides water storage that can be drawn on when groundwater supplies become depleted (Vorogushyn et al. 2012; Pavelic et al. 2012). They also serve to reduce downstream peak flow and aid in retaining flood waters which reduces associated flood risks downstream (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada 2012; Pavelic et al. 2012). If water is released from the reservoir, they serve to replenish groundwater stores downstream (Pavelic et al. 2012). Under drought conditions, these systems enable farmers to draw water from the reservoirs to support crop irrigation (Pavelic et al. 2012). These systems have been effective for increasing and stabilizing crop yields via irrigation in locations such as Texas, Kansas, Kentucky, India, and Thailand (Arnold and Stockle 1991).|$|R
40|$|Nowadays, due to fast dental progress, {{planning}} of partial dentures is continuously improving, permitting application of contemporary and modern <b>retention</b> <b>systems.</b> Because {{of the presence}} of many different dental attachments on the market, the decision which one to use for each particular case is a big challenge for the dentist.

The results confirm that AcryLock and Vario-Soft 3 represent similar systems. They insure good retention, with an additional option for dosed retention by using different plastic matrices depending on each particular case. Although these attachments with plastic parts are not newest innovation, they have a big value due to their characteristics - durability, affordable price and possibility for easy and simple maintenance, offering a chance to replace the plastic part if necessary. They insure high quality and long lasting dental prosthodontic appliances that can be used in many different situations. Keywords: Extra-Coronal Attachments; AcryLock; Vario-Soft 3...|$|R
