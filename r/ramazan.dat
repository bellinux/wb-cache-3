25|$|Candidates {{themselves}} {{were subject to}} violence, with AKP candidates visiting Van being forced to take refuge in a HDP party office after being greeted by boos and hostility {{from members of the}} public. The CHP's top candidate in Adana, Elif Doğan Türkmen, was shot on 27 May, though her injuries were not life-threatening. A similar stabbing attack took place against AKP candidate <b>Ramazan</b> Demir. Breakouts of violence between Kurdish nationalists and AKP activists, as well as Patriotic Party activists, also took place.

2500|$|According to <b>Ramazan</b> Rajabov, the oblique stem of 42% of the nouns is {{different}} from the absolutive stem. Some nouns change their internal structure (such as a vowel), but others add one of about 20 so-called [...] "thematic suffixes" [...] to their end, to which the other case suffixes are attached. For example, the word for [...] "language" [...] or [...] "tongue" [...] is mec, but its oblique stem is mecr-, hence its plural is mecrebi, the ergative mecrā and so on. Rajabov says that the choice of the correct thematic suffix is sometimes difficult even for native speakers. It is likely that their origin lies in an application of two different plural forms, in a similar way as in English the word [...] "children" [...] actually has two archaic plural endings: -(e)r and -en. In Tsez it is sometimes even possible to use both the archaic and the regular and more productive -bi plural for a word.|$|E
2500|$|Hajibeyov's second opera Sheikh Sanan {{was written}} in 1909 {{in a form that}} was entirely {{opposite}} to the first. This time Hajibeyov employed a purely European style. Sheikh Sanan received raves as a musical composition, but the content was too progressive for the period. In this opera, Hajibeyov advocated that marriage should not be bound by nationality or religion - in essence, it was another form of integration. But this time, it backfired. The story line follows a religious sheikh on his way to Mecca who meets a very beautiful Georgian lady. To his horror, the lovely creature's father {{turns out to be a}} swineherd, caring for what, to him, was a forbidden animal. In the end, the sheikh denounces his religion to win the woman. It is said that when the opera was performed, many people were offended and walked out, leaving Hajibeyov with the realization that he had outpaced his generation too much this time. As a result, he made a drastic decision and burned the score. When asked by <b>Ramazan</b> Khalilov, his assistant, how he could do that, Hajibeyov replied: [...] "I didn't destroy my opera. It's my own creation so it's always in my head." [...] Khalilov said that Hajibeyov went on to use this same magnificent music 27 years later to create Koroğlu, an opera that many acclaim to be his finest.|$|E
