50|$|After the UK's {{electric}} supply industry was privatised in 1989, it was operated by National Power. In 1992, {{one of the}} station's units were decommissioned. The station's other four units were decommissioned in 1993. The closure left a stockpile of {{nearly half a million}} tonnes of coal, which was transported downstream to the nearby Tilbury Power Station by <b>Rhine</b> <b>barge.</b>|$|E
50|$|Hillebrandus Cornelius Klinkert (June 11, 1829 - November 20, 1913) was a Dutch Mennonite missionary and translator. He {{was born}} in Amsterdam and worked as an {{engineer}} in a machine factory at Rotterdam and on a <b>Rhine</b> <b>barge</b> before he contacted the DZV (Doopsgezinde Zendings Vereeniging) in 1851 with a request to be sent as a missionary. Klinkert was also known {{for his ability to}} translate the Bible into different dialects of Malay so that the Javanese people could access the Gospel, and completed his first entire translation at the end of 1878.|$|E
50|$|Lisalotte Duden {{was born}} in Frankfurt, Germany, in 1905. She came from a family who opposed the rise of Nazism, but their {{opposition}} gained them no benefit. Her education in Frankfurt, Geneva and Amsterdam University instilled in her an awareness of international affairs. Lilo married Hans Milchsack, a <b>Rhine</b> <b>barge</b> owner. Visiting Britain before the war, she pleaded with Britons to resist Hitler, only to be ignored and labeled a traitor. During the war, her family withdrew from public life. After the Second World War her husband was asked to be mayor of Düsseldorf. Lilo was keen to improve relations between Britain and Germany. She met Robert Birley who was an education advisor to the British military in Germany. With Birley's assistance she formed an association in 1949.|$|E
50|$|The Rhine port of Basel connects Switzerland to the Port of Rotterdam {{and thus}} to the sea trade network. Swiss {{industry}} and commerce rely on this connection, exploited for centuries by Swiss <b>Rhine</b> <b>barges,</b> for {{a substantial part of}} their imports and exports.|$|R
2500|$|Clearing the Scheldt Estuary and {{bringing}} {{the port of}} Antwerp into use as a supply base was {{an important element in}} the Overlord plan. The planners envisaged a large AA Gun Defence Area (GDA) to deal not only with conventional air raids but also the threat of V-1 flying bombs (codenamed 'Divers'). 114th LAA Rgt was equipped with the [...] Vickers No 1 AA Predictor (normally used by 3.7-inch HAA batteries) to tackle these small fast-moving targets and on 18 October it arrived at Antwerp to reinforce 5th Royal Marine AA Bde. At first it was deployed along the tops of dykes to guard against German aircraft laying mines in the Scheldt Estuary: the regiment suggested {{that it would be better}} to place the guns on <b>Rhine</b> <b>barges</b> (F Troop finally embarked on barges in mid-January). The first 'Diver' arrived in the Antwerp area on 23 October, and the regiment suffered a few casualties, including a fatality when a cinema in the city was hit.|$|R
50|$|The {{syndicate}} {{was set up}} as coal producers moved towards using shipping {{rather than}} railways to deliver their coal to Rotterdam. The cartel co-operated with the Dutch Coal Trade Union, to whom they gave the sole distribution rights for Westphalian coal. Daniël George van Beuningen of the Steenkolen Handels Vereniging was a leading figure in this relationship, greatly {{increasing the amount of}} coal imported to Rotterdam and resulting in the cost of using <b>Rhine</b> based <b>barges</b> dropping as their greater use also stimulated technical innovation.|$|R
2500|$|Maurice {{had heard}} from recent {{intelligence}} across the Rhine that the sconce was besieged by 6-7,000 men with 1,800 horsemen, many of these [...] troops were veteran Tercios. Maurice had an army equal in size to that of Parma and so his army crossed the <b>Rhine</b> in <b>barges</b> and then set up camp. The distance between the two armies in the Betuwe was four or five miles, along the two routes leading from Arnhem to Nijmegen. One route ran along a dyke wall raised above the low lands, and was most used in winter; the other was broader.|$|R
500|$|With Villeroi {{shadowing}} Marlborough's every move, Marlborough's gamble {{that the}} French would not move against the weakened Dutch {{position in the}} Netherlands paid off. In any case, Marlborough had promised {{to return to the}} Netherlands if a French attack developed there, transferring his troops down the <b>Rhine</b> on <b>barges</b> at a rate of [...] a day. Encouraged by this promise (whatever it was worth) the States General agreed to release the Danish contingent of seven battalions and 22 squadrons as a reinforcement. Marlborough reached Ladenburg, in the plain of the Neckar and the Rhine, and there halted for three days to rest his cavalry and allow the guns and infantry to close up. On 6 June he arrived at Wiesloch, south of Heidelberg. The following day, the Allied army swung away from the Rhine towards the hills of the Swabian Jura and the Danube beyond. At last Marlborough's destination was established without doubt.|$|R
