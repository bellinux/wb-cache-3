40|$|All {{over the}} world, {{a large number}} of road {{accidents}} are occurring every year causing loss of life, injuries and loss of property. In a research study done in Sri Lanka, these losses had been quantified and it was shown that the total cost of traffic accidents in Sri Lanka is about 1 % of the GDP of the country. Therefore, there is an urgent need to have a properly designed <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programme</b> to bring down the accident costs and save the lives. As the budget available for the road safety would be limited, especially in developing countries, it is vital to priorities the road safety improvements. There are two such mechanisms identified in this research termed as Equivalent Accident Number (EAN) and the Weighted Accident Number (WAN).

40|$|A common {{understanding}} of evidence-based {{policy is that}} any new measures should have been proven to be effective. At best, these kinds of methodologically sound evaluation studies show {{the effect of a}} measure in a given situation. The results are then an essential basis for the design of a broader safety policy. However, at present there is generally little understanding of the effect of the measure in another situation, or of how it would interact with other measures in a programme. Yet, it is precisely such questions that need to be answered if the requirements of policy makers are to be met. Politicians {{need to be able to}} estimate whether the expected benefits of a programme justify the investment. Therefore, evidence-based road safety policy should not rely solely on evaluation studies of single measures and ex-post assessments of safety programmes.

In the European Union, a <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Programme</b> was adopted in 2011, with the objective to reduce road deaths in Europe by 50 % in the period from 2011 to 2020. Evidence suggests, however, that this goal will not be met. Against this background, this paper investigates police perspectives on traffic laws, traffic behaviour, and transport policy. Police officers working with road safety are {{in a unique position}} to evaluate and judge the efficiency of road safety policies, as they record traffic offences, fine, investigate, and witness in court. Geographically, focus is on transport policy in Germany, a country with a dense road network, high levels of car ownership, and a large number of car manufacturers. A total of 14 semi-structured interviews were carried out with police officers in a wide variety of positions within the traffic police in Freiburg. Thematic analysis is used to analyse content and to identify aspects that represent major areas of concern. Officers affirm that traffic laws question traffic safety, for instance with regard to speed and speed limits, or elderly drivers.

40|$|Road safety {{has been}} a main {{societal}} and policy issue in many European countries since {{the early years of}} last decade. After the 2000 - 2010 <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Programme</b> launched by the European Commission, in 2011 the Commission adopted the new 2020 programme, even more demanding than the previous. As the societal consequences of road casualties are increasingly perceived as a core dimension of smart mobility, road safety system is now facing new challenges. Current mobility shifts to softer and greener transportation means raise new safety concerns for an increasingly larger share of vulnerable road users. The need to integrate road safety requirements with other residential, mobility, and environmental policies calls for a more detailed understanding of the phenomenon at different spatial levels and with different observation lenses. The pilot study described in this paper is a contribution to this end. It aims at identifying the accident prone sites of the regional road network to help prioritizing safety interventions, by the regional administration having road planning responsibilities. The study develops a screening approach to select hazardous road locations, outside urban premises, from the Piedmont provincial and state roads. The most recent data for the 2010 - 2012 years were considered, drawn from the ISTAT road accident database, managed by the CMRSS. The procedure consists of the following steps: identification of the elementary road sections to be screened, through a GIS analysis; definition of the screening groups (road sections have been subdivided in 4 length classes); definition of the selection criteria, with two severity thresholds based on the crash density; classification of the elementary road sections by severity thresholds...|$|E

Most drivers tend to overestimate their own ability and capability of their vehicle to react within the sufficient time to avoid crashes. Dangerous driving behaviour such as speeding, fatigue, using mobile phone and drive aggressively are recognised as a major factors in causing road accident in Malaysia. Pasir Gudang, had been chosen as the study area. A sample of 100 drivers was selected by used simple random sampling method for a questionnaire survey. The findings of this study reveal that generally, most of the drivers are particular on their time management because most of them are set their target to reach the destination but then they disobey the law on the road.

40|$|This report {{discusses}} the road safety in Latin American developing countries, focusing mainly on Bolivia. To give the layman an overview, the general road traffic problem is explained. The factors on which road safety depends are described, {{as well as}} the degree in which the accident causes - human, vehicle and environment - are involved in a road crash. For the purpose of an uniform understanding of the term developing countries, they are defined from a traffic point of view. Thereafter, different definitions of the term crash are discussed. To make it possible to compare the countries with dissimilar crash definitions, the required adjustment factors are exposed. The countries are classified in three groups depending on the number of motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants. Bolivia as the emphasis of the study is described in detail. First general facts are presented, so the reader knows what type of country Bolivia is. Secondly, the amplitude and sort of the network is explained. After this, the traffic incidents, i. e. number, type and cause, are summarised. To be able to propose some measures for the enhancement of the traffic situation it is essential to analyse the actual state. This is done in the next step. The most important existing regulations are described {{as well as the}} safety campaigns which were introduced in the past. Based on this, proposals to improve the safety are listed. As speeding and driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} are the main accident causes, countermeasures for them are proposed. These are classified into engineering, enforcement and education.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{introduce}} the achievements of Latvian National <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Programme</b> from years 2007 to 2013. This program was developed by the government to meet the main requirements of National Transport Development Policy, that is - to reduce by 50 % road accident fatalities by the year 2010 as the intermediate requirement and to reduce road traffic fatalities by 70 % by the year 2013 as the final requirement (compared with the statistic data of year 2001). The paper will describe the criteria which were selected to analyze the safety situation, as well as basic statistic data of Road Traffic Safety Directorate that will show the tendencies in road safety as a result of introduction and execution of National Programme as well as the comparison of the present situation to the effectiveness of introduction of previous National Programme (years 2000 - 2006). The aim of National Program’s activities is primarily oriented on the „road – environment – vehicle – traffic participant” system safety level’s improvement. Analysis of the growth number of vehicles over last ten years led to the prognoses that this number will continue to grow, what can negatively affect not only traffic safety, but also the environment. So, during development of the Programme in order to make prognoses, two initial scenarios were proposed – the pessimistic scenario and the optimistic scenario. Both scenarios will be described in this paper. After that, 8 main tasks were introduced. They are: to improve a safety of pedestrians and cyclists, to improve a safety of the children in road traffic, to ensure that safe speed limitations are executed, to control and limit the number of drunk drivers, to limit a tired drivers’ participation in traffic, to lower the severity level of road accidents, to develop a wide participation of society in solving traffic safety problems, and to perform constant measures of maintaining normal traffic according to safety requirements. The cost benefit ratio based summary represents main results of the effectiveness of previous National Programme, and a prognosis of the effectiveness of the present Programme is introduced in the form of charts.

40|$|Poland {{would like}} to improve its road safety situation. This {{requires}} efforts at national, regional, and municipal levels. A proper management structure is being attended to {{and there is a}} National <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> <b>Programme.</b> Some regions and municipalities have also prepared programmes. The preparation, implementation, and evaluation of a road safety policy could be supported by a Road Safety Information System (RSIS), giving direct access to relevant, up-to-date, and verified information. Bringing key data and knowledge to the professionals' desks lowers the threshold for actually using this information. This has several advantages: it raises awareness of the road safety problem; it helps develop a common perspective on road safety and facilitates communication; it contributes to the quality and efficiency of decision making. Implementing an RSIS in Poland is considered to be feasible on account of: the importance attached to the improvement of road safety in Poland; the availability of a road safety management structure; the availability of relevant data. This report is meant to facilitate the implementation of an RSIS in Poland by identifying potential user groups, contents, and technical prerequisites. The RSIS should contain key data and knowledge on general developments and all issues identified as major problems. The magnitude of the problems is indicated in qualitative terms: background information, explanations of developments and measures to combat the problems help the professionals decide what to do. As an example, all subjects mentioned in GAMBIT 2000 are elaborated upon in this report, taking the availability of data into account. The RSIS is not meant to answer all questions concerning road safety that might arise: for this purpose an Information Desk - which also gives technical assistance - could be set up. It is recommended to start with a pilot phase and develop the RSIS incrementally. Activities that contribute {{to the success of the}} RSIS are, among other things, organising user feedback and user support. Otherwise the system matching users' needs cannot be ensured. Finally the efforts needed to implement an RSIS are estimated. If, to start with, the Dutch Road Safety Information System is used, this will require only moderate modifications. A proposal is included for involving a number of organisations and their main tasks are determined. Looking at the potential importance of the RSIS, it is recommended that the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Economy decides about the outlines (purposes, restrictions etc.) and is responsible for financing the activities.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the evaluation of}} one of the first region-wide enforcement projects, a pilot-project in the province of Friesland which started in 1998 and which preceded the large scale national programme which was to follow. The evaluation study covered a five year period of intensified speed enforcement along 28 above-average dangerous road stretches of the rural network with mainly unobtrusive mobile radar equipment. In co-operation with the Dutch Bureau of Traffic Enforcement, SWOV Institute for Road Safety Research carried out the present evaluation. In {{the first three years of}} the project an annual average of about 4500 effective control hours was sufficient to bring down substantially the level of speed offenders on the checked road segments. Statistical analysis could not detect a significant differences between decrease in speeding on enforced and non-enforced 80 km/h roads. Despite this lack of hard evidence, there are indications that suggest that enforcement indeed has made a difference. First, the decreasing trend in speeding in absolute numbers was larger on 80 km/h than on non-enforced 80 km/h roads. The fact that there was also a decreasing trend on non-enforced roads may have to do with a spill-over of enforcement. Since both on enforced and non-enforced roads the decreasing trend started in 1998, the first year of the enforcement programme, such an spill-over effects seems likely. Second, the general decreasing trend in speeding which started in 1998 cannot likely be explained by any other factor than enforcement. In the year 1998 there was not a large scale provincial <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programme</b> focused on roads outside urban areas, and there was not a drastic changes in mobility in. What we know from the psychology of drivers is that they do not ""spontaneously"" turn into safe drivers without any change in the road environment. If police enforcement did not play a substantial role in reducing speeds on the roads in Friesland, we are at a loss to suggest an alternative explanation. Based on the available data, the best possible estimate of the 5 -year traffic safety effect of the enforcement programme has been a 21 % reduction of serious casualties and a 21 % reduction of injury accidents as a result of crashes with motorised traffic. nts translates into the extra saving of about 35 serious casualties and 50 injury accidents. Due to the limited number of fatalities we did not perform any separate analysis on reduction of fatalities. However, with an estimated reduction of 35 serious casualties, it seems highly likely that between 3 - 5 fatalities have been saved. For the covering abstract see ITRD E 136183...|$|E

Given {{the burden of}} injury produced by traffic, using only fatalities as an indicator to monitor road safety gives a very small picture of the health impact of traffic crashes, {{just the tip of}} the iceberg. Moreover, in several countries during the last years the number of serious traffic injuries has not been decreasing as fast as the number of fatalities. In other countries the number of serious traffic injuries has even been increasing (Berecki-Gisolf et al., 2013; IRTAD Working Group on Serious Road Traffic Casualties, 2010; Weijermars et al., 2015). Therefore, serious traffic injuries are more commonly being adopted by policy makers as an additional indicator of road safety. Reducing the number of serious traffic injuries is one of the key priorities in the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programme</b> 2011 - 2020 of the European Commission (EC, 2010). To be able to compare performance and monitor developments in serious traffic injuries across Europe, a common definition of a serious road injury was necessary. In January 2013, the High Level Group on Road Safety, representing all EU Member States, established the definition of serious traffic injuries as road casualties with an injury level of MAIS ≥ 3. The Maximum AIS represents the most severe injury obtained by a casualty according to the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). Traditionally the main source of information on traffic accidents and injuries has been the police registration. This provides the official data for statistics at national and European level (CARE Database). Data reported by police usually is very detailed about the circumstances of the crash particularly if there are people injured or killed. But on the other hand police cannot assess the severity of injuries in a reliable way, due, obviously to their training. Therefore, police based data use to classify people involved in a crash as fatality, severe injured if hospitalised more than 24 hours and slight injured if not hospitalised. Moreover, it is known that even a so clear definition as a fatality is not always well reported and produces underreporting. This is due to several factors such as lack of coverage of police at the scene or people dying at hospital not followed by police (Amoros et al., 2006; Broughton et al., 2007; Pérez et al., 2006). Hospital records of patients with road traffic injuries usually include very little information on circumstances of the crash but it does contain data about the person, the hospitalisation (date of hospitalisation and discharge, medical diagnosis, mechanism or external cause of injury, and interventions). Hospital inpatient Discharge Register (HDR) offers an opportunity to complement police data on road traffic injuries. Medical diagnoses can be used to derive information about severity of injuries. Among others, one of the possible scales to measure injury severity is the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). The High Level group identified three main ways Member States can collect data on serious traffic injuries (MAIS ≥ 3) : 1) by applying a correction on police data, 2) by using hospital data and 3) by using linked police and hospital data. Once one of these three ways is selected, several additional choices need to be made. In order to be able to compare injury data across different countries, it is important to understand the effects of methodological choices on the estimated numbers of serious traffic injuries. A number of questions arise: How to determine the correction factors that are to be applied to police data? How to select road traffic casualties in the hospital data and how to derive MAIS ≥ 3 casualties? How should police and hospital data be linked and how can the number of MAIS ≥ 3 casualties be determined on the basis of the linked data sources? Currently, EU member states use different procedures to determine the number of MAIS ≥ 3 traffic injuries, dependent on the available data. Given the major differences in the procedures being applied, the quality of the data differs considerably and the numbers are not yet fully comparable between countries. In order to be able to compare injury data across different countries, it is important to understand the effects of methodological choices on the estimated numbers of serious traffic injuries. Work Package 7 of SafetyCube project is dedicated to serious traffic injuries, their health impacts and their costs. One of the aims of work package 7 is to assess and improve the estimation of the number of serious traffic injuries. The aim of this deliverable (D 7. 1) is to report practices in Europe concerning the reporting of serious traffic injuries and to provide guidelines and recommendations applied to each of the three main ways to estimate the number of road traffic serious injuries. Specific objectives for this deliverable are to: Describe the current state of collection of data on serious traffic injuries across Europe Provide practical guidelines for the estimation of the number of serious traffic injuries for each of the three ways identified by the High Level Group Examine how the estimated number of serious traffic injuries is affected by differences in methodology...|$|E
40|$|This {{literature}} review of traffic education programmes addresses the current practice in evaluation research, {{the effectiveness of}} programmes and their constituting components and the differences and similarities with other fields of education. The study leads {{to a number of}} conclusions which can be divided into three categories and are listed below. Conclusions about evaluation studies: - Although a large number of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> education <b>programmes</b> exist, the number of programmes that is followed by thorough and "by the book" evaluations, is rather limited. - Very few studies use crashes as an evaluation criterion: most use intermediate variables such as knowledge, attitudes and (self-reported) safe behaviour. - The vast majority of evaluated <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programmes</b> have children who are not yet in their teens as their target group, and focus on the pedestrian role. - Evaluations have mainly been done in high income western countries so the findings cannot be generalized for developing countries. Conclusions about comparisons with health promotion education: - Traffic safety education has similar patterns as health promotion education. - Shortage of systematic evaluation studies hampers the progression towards effective programmes. - As in traffic safety education, primarily intermediate variables are used: variables related to a healthy lifestyle rather than to the frequency of behavioural afflictions. Conclusions about effective components: Because of the relatively large number of evaluation studies, this study has primarily analysed the "effective components" of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programmes</b> for children. - <b>Road</b> <b>safety</b> education should start as early as the age of 4 - 5 and needs to be continued through primary and secondary school. - Individual training is superior to group training. Group training should focus on interactions between children. - Adult-led learning and peer collaboration are powerful instruments because of the influence of social interaction on learning (model behaviour). - Small stages of practical training are effective to form a concept based on action. Both, practice and developmental theories support this statement. - Classroom instruction enriched with good demonstrations of model behaviour (e. g. by means of video, table-top models, etc) is slightly less effective than behavioural training. - Computer-supported practical training (for small groups of children interacting with each other) is effective. - No difference in effects on knowledge between training methods such as play-mat models, board game and illustrated posters...|$|R
40|$|Strategic <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programmes</b> {{setting out}} {{long-term}} visions and road infrastructure development plans {{must be based}} on <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> forecasts and an understanding of the long-term impact of different measures on <b>road</b> <b>safety.</b> The objective {{of this paper is to}} discuss a concept of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> management for an area of a selected country because there are no simple tools of <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> management for the development and implementation of national and regional <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> strategies. The paper will present a method for estimating fatalities and road fatality rate in relation to the most significant sources of hazard. To estimate the number of fatalities a multiple factor model was used which is the quotient of the population of a country as a measure of risk exposure and the road fatality rate as the measure of the probability of road accident consequences. To implement the proposed method a general procedure was developed for estimating fatalities for a specific area. The paper will present a proposed risk classification as the key to risk evaluation and a method for determining the potential for reducing societal risk and indicate those countries which have the highest potential for road death reduction...|$|R
40|$|According to {{a recent}} WHO study (2013), South Africa has a {{mortality}} rate of 31. 9 per 100 000 population ranking it 177 th of the 182 countries participating in the study. The Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) is the lead agency for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> matters in South Africa. Its overall goal is to improve <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> management and to design a set of effective <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programmes</b> which are well matched with the Safe System approach, and will have their effects on the numbers of (fatal and injury-related) crashes. The RTMC commissioned SWOV to draft a <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Strategy for South Africa. The current report is the first Deliverable, addressing {{the first phase of}} the project: the Inception Report. The aim of this first phase was to get a clear understanding of all the issues related to <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> in South Africa and to get a clear picture of how to design and implement subsequent phases. The information in this report is collected through face-to-face interviews of several relevant national and regional high level stakeholders, presentations by RTMC staff and during a workshop with a Reference Group set up by the RTMC and consisting of independent academics, experts and practitioners. In addition, the RTMC provided several supporting documents and data. The Inception Report presents the preliminary findings concerning the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> situation in South Africa, the current crash registration practices, and the work done so far towards a <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> strategy, and places these findings in the framework of global <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> developments and national policies. The report concludes that there is a sound body of scientific evidence available to combat the occurrence of road crashes. However, an effective National <b>Road</b> <b>Safety</b> Strategy must be based on a thorough diagnosis of road traffic injuries in South Africa, on current policies and on organisational structures. The Strategy needs to consist of two main components: a ‘management’ component and an ‘intervention’ component. The report proposes to structure the work according to three recognized international sources: 1. The three level approach for analysing <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> problems (Rumar, 1999); 2. The SUNflower approach for comparing <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> performances of countries (Koornstra et al., 2002); 3. The World Bank country guidelines for <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> management capacity reviews (Bliss & Breen, 2009). Furthermore, the report proposes to carry out the project in two more phases. In Phase 2 relevant information has to be collected to get a thorough view of the status quo as well as the of gaps to bridge to realise the <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> level that South Africa wants to reach at some future point in time. In Phase 3 the actual strategy and related implementable <b>road</b> <b>safety</b> <b>programmes</b> have to be drafted and introduced. The findings of the current Inception Phase clearly show that wide consultation with South African key stakeholders during both subsequent phases is vital for success...|$|R
