5000|$|The House of Lords - {{whose members}} at the time {{averaged}} an age of 69 - primarily acts as a <b>reviewing</b> <b>chamber,</b> and the second reading is often in effect about the principles of a bill. The bill was therefore expected to be faced with a difficult hurdle, including strong, vocal opposition. A rarely used [...] "wrecking" [...] motion was tabled by Lord Dear, to effectively reject the bill in full, in place of its second reading. Speakers opposed to the bill {{described it as a}} breach of tradition, undemocratic, against religion, and ill thought out. Supporters of the bill included peers who were themselves in long-term same-sex relationships (Lord Alli, Baroness Barker, Lord Black of Brentwood, Lord Smith of Finsbury), and a fourth whose daughter was in a same-sex relationship, as well as heterosexual peers such as Lord Jenkin who had been supportive of gay rights for decades. Nine of the 14 Anglican bishops attending voted for the amendment and five abstained.|$|E
