40|$|Purpose: Improvement of {{functional}} properties alloyed of {{hot work tool steel}} surface layers {{is one of}} the goals of this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The material used for investigation was the hot work tool steel X 38 CrMoV 5 - 3. <b>Remelting</b> and <b>alloying</b> of surface layers were made using the HPDL high power diode laser Rofin DL 020 in the laser power range of 1. 2 - 2. 3 kW. The carbide powders were applied on specimens prepared and degreased in this way; the powder was mixed with the sodium glass as inorganic binder in proportion of 30 % binder and 70 % powder. Paste coating 0. 5 mm thick was put down in each case. Findings: The hardness changes of the surface layers obtained by <b>remelting</b> and <b>alloying</b> with carbides using the high power diode laser are accompanied with the improved tribological properties compared to the conventionally heat treated steel. The highest abrasion wear resistance, more than 2. 5 times higher than that of the base material, was revealed in case the steel alloyed with vanadium carbide. Research limitations/implications: These advantages are the result of features unique to the HPDL, such as: shorter wavelength (thus better beam absorption for most metallic materials, and smaller absorption length) and better temporal beam stability (due to beam integration) compared to Nd:YAG and CO 2 lasers. HPDL materials processing is, therefore, expected to produce better quality and more consistent and repeatable results for applications requiring beam spot sizes larger than 0. 5 mm diameter. One of the issues of concern in the practical applications of the lasers in materials processing for mass production is the repeatability.

Abrasion wear resistance tests weremade in the metal-ceramic material arrangement (ASTM-G 65), and also in the metal-metal one. Findings: All employed carbides cause hardness and microhardness increase of the surface layer of theinvestigated steel, and in most cases abrasion wear resistance increase. The investigations carried out indicatethat the best mechanical properties are displayed by the surface layers of steel alloyed with carbides: TaC,NbC, and VC; whereas, the best tribological properties are displayed by surface layers alloyed with vanadiumcarbide, compared to the conventionally heat treated steel. Improvement of mechanical properties and abrasionwear resistance grow with the increase of the laser power.

The reason of this work was also to determine the laser treatment parameters, particularly the laser power, to achieve surface layer with better properties for example hardness which is connected with abrasive wear resistance of surface layers.

During the laser surface <b>remelting</b> and <b>alloying</b> of the titanium alloy in argon and nitrogenatmospheres, surface layers of high hardness and significantly higher erosion wear resistant, compared with thebase material of titanium alloy Ti 6 Al 4 V, were produced. Findings: The surface layers are composites of titanium nitrides participations in the titanium alloy matrix. Hardness of the surface layers and erosion wear resistance depends strongly on parameters of laser processing andon the partial pressure of nitrogen in the gas mixture of nitrogen-argon atmosphere. Research limitations/implications: The most critical parameter of the functional quality of titanium alloyblades of turbofan engine and steam turbines is the fatigue strength, therefore further investigations are required todetermine the fatigue strength and also internal stresses in the nitrided surface layers.

Laser alloying of surface layer of investigated steel without introducing alloying additions into liquid molten metal pool, in the whole range of used laser power, causes size reduction of dendritic microstructure with the direction of crystallization consistent with the direction of heat carrying away from the zone of impact of laser beam. Findings: In the effect of laser alloying with powders of carbides NbC, TaC, TiC, WC and VC occurs size reduction of microstructure as well as dispersion hardening through fused in but partially dissolved carbides and consolidation through enrichment of surface layer in alloying additions coming from dissolving carbides. Introduced particles of carbides and in part remain undissolved, creating conglomerates being a result of fusion of undissolved powder grains into molten metal base. In effect of convection movements of material in the liquid state, conglomerates of carbides arrange themselves in the characteristic of swirl. Remelting of the steel without introducing into liquid molten pool the alloying additions in the form of carbide powders, causes slight increase of properties of surface layer of investigated steel in comparison to its analogical properties obtained through conventional heat treatment, depending on the laser beam power implemented for remelting.

This method is able to increase surface hardness, for example in layered castings used for pistons in automotive engines...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The regular {{pattern of}} {{evolution}} of TiC and TiAl 3 during the remelting process of Al-Ti-C alloy wires was analyzed {{and the impact}} mechanism was discussed. The results show that: when {{the temperature of the}} remelting mass is at 730 ˚C, with the increase of the heat preservation time of remelting, the degree of agglomeration of the original dispersed TiC will increase, and they are pushed toward crystal boundaries by α-Al during the solidification process, while TiAl 3 will dissolve, aggregate, and grow. When the remelting temperature is at 1000 ˚C, as the heat preservation time increases, not only the agglomeration degree of TiC increases significantly compared to that at 730 ˚C and the sizes and shapes of TiAl 3 change significantly as well. The morphology of TiAl 3 will change from being lump-and-short-rod-like to needle-and-flake-like. Before and after <b>remelting,</b> the Al-Ti-C <b>alloys</b> are both composed of TiAl 3 and TiC, with no other phases formed...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{the effect of}} alloying with WC, TaC and TiC on structure and mechanical propertiesof the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 steel surface layer using the HPDL (High Power Diode Laser). Design/methodology/approach: The microstructure of the alloyed layers which were formed on the surface ofthe investigated hot work steel was examined using optical microscope. The tribological wear relationships usingpin-on-disc test were specified for surface layers subject to laser treatment, determining the friction coefficient,and mass loss of the investigated surfaces. X-ray diffraction (XRD) technique was used to investigate crystallinestructure and phases in the layers. Findings: The metallographic investigations on light microscope show that during alloying the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 {{hot work tool steel}} with the WC, TaC and TiC powder layer the obtained run face is characteristic of the highroughness, multiple pores, irregularity, and flashes at the borders. The changes of the surface layers hardnessformed as a result of <b>remelting</b> and <b>alloying</b> with ceramic powders containing carbides are accompanied withthe increased tribological properties. Research limitations/implications: In order to evaluate with more detail the possibility of applying thesesurface layers in tools, further investigations should be concentrated on the determination of the thermal fatigueresistance of the layers. Practical implications: The alloyed layers which were formed {{on the surface of the}} hot work steel have shownsignificant improvement. Good properties of the laser treatment make these layers suitable for various technicaland industrial applications. Originality/value: Structural and tribological behaviour of surface layer achieved by alloying and remeltingusing high diode power laser and selected ceramic powders were compared...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} <b>remelting</b> and <b>alloying</b> laser {{parameters}} on the structure and properties of the surface layer of the X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 and 32 CrMoV 12 - 28 hot work tool steels, using the high power diode laser (HPDL) are presented. Design/methodology/approach: The effect was determined of the main alloying parameters on hardness, abrasive wear resistance and roughness. The hot work tool steels conventionally heat treated were used as reference material and the tantalum carbide {{was used as an}} <b>alloying</b> material. The <b>remelted</b> layers which were formed in the surface of investigated hot work tool steels were metallographically examined and analyzed using a hardness testing machine. Findings: It was found out in examinations of the surface layer that it can be possible to obtain high quality top layer with higher hardness and abrasive wear resistance compared to material after conventional heat treatment. Research limitations/implications: The surface layer and its properties are elements which are critical for lifetime of tools and parts of machines and also for lifetime of whole technical equipment. If the working surface of a tool or its part is exposed to rough friction, an intensive mass and volume loss occurs. In this case it is reasonable to produce a surface layer which is extremely wear resistant to avoid the mass and volume loss. Originality/value: The research results of this type of heat treatment show that there is a possibility of applying the worked out technology to manufacturing or regeneration of chosen hot working tools...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this paper}} was to study the laser {{treatment}} technique and parameters, particularly the laser power, to achieve a high value of layer properties like hardness and microhardness for protection of this hot work tool steel from losing their work stability and to make the tool surface more resistant for work. The purpose of this work was also to determine technological and technical conditions for remelting the surface layer with HPDL. Design/methodology/approach: This work presents the results of new laser treatment techniques applied in metal surface technology. There is presented laser treatment with <b>remelting</b> and/or <b>alloying</b> of X 40 CrMoV 5 - 1 and 32 CrMoV 12 - 28 hot work tool steels with carbide powders as well as results of laser remelting influence on microstructure and properties of the surface, carried out using the high power diode laser (HPDL). Special attention was devoted to monitoring of the layer morphology of the investigated material and on the particle occurred. Findings: The layer is without cracks and defects as well as has a considerably higher hardness value compared to the non remelted material. The hardness value increases according to the laser power used so that the highest power applied gives to highest hardness value in the remelted layer. Research limitations/implications: The results present only four selected laser powers by one process speed rate. Also carbide powders were used for alloying with the particle size in a chosen range. Originality/value: The originality of this work is based on applying of High Power Diode Laser for improvement of steel mechanical properties...|$|R
