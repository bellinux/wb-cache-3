40|$|The spot foreign {{exchange}} marketplaces are {{split into two}} types by their respective trading rules: markets with conventional resting orders versus markets with resting that orders that include optionality. This optionality {{is owned by the}} counterparty who placed the <b>resting</b> <b>order</b> and provides the option to refuse the aggressive order matched against the <b>resting</b> <b>order.</b> This paper describes and contrasts these two types of markets. A valuation method for these very short expiry options on the later marketplace is proposed. Appropriate historical volatility metrics are defined and applied for these uniquely short expiry timescales. These historical volatility and valuation methods are used to describe some historical intraday periods, and are applied to various trading scenarios. Unique behaviors driven by the value of these options are highlighted. The benefits and risks of trading on these markets are described in light of this valuation approach. The effects of various addition constraints on the liquidity providers for these optionality matching marketplaces are introduced. Through judicious timing of order placement and appropriate constraints on the behaviors of the liquidity providers on these markets, the result is shown to be tighter spreads, greater breath and depth of liquidity, and the high fill ratios than the more conventional non-optionality matching markets...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} impact of market structure developments on order submission strategies and market quality. The importance of these issues is underscored by the increasing prevalence of algorithmic trading in domestic and international equities markets over the past decade, as technological advances and market structures change the way market participants, exchanges, and regulators behave and interact. Algorithmic traders are becoming an increasingly significant liquidity demanding and supplying market participant, whose growing prevalence {{can be attributed to}} the increasing speed at which they can interact with a market and/or web of interlinked markets. Each essay addresses a research question and set of testable hypotheses that are underscored by scarce or conflicting prior research findings regarding {{the impact of}} contemporary market structure developments on order submission strategies and market quality. The first essay investigates the trading performance and price impact of algorithmic traders relative to the other market participants. Results indicate that algorithmic traders trade at less favourable prices than human traders when initiating trades. Algorithmic traders also position their limit orders closer to the best bid and ask quotes compared to human traders. The second essay computes queue time as the time (seconds and milliseconds) that a passive <b>resting</b> <b>order</b> remains at the best bid (buy) or offer (sell) before it interacts with a marketable counterparty trade. This essay offers an empirical examination of waiting costs which are analysed in a range of theoretical literature. The final essay examines the relationship between cost recovery and fee models that charge brokers for market participation with respect to message traffic and trading activity, and high frequency trading and market quality.

40|$|PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: Over {{the last}} few years, adverse {{selection}} has been a widely discussed topic in the equity markets as it has traditionally been seen as having a detrimental effect on a trader's performance. Especially, institutional investors have raised concerns of adverse selection from executing with high-frequency trading (HFT) counterparties. In Europe, today's institutional investors {{have the opportunity to}} trade away from the displayed markets and execute orders in dark pools, which should lead to reduced information leakage, and thus also to reduced adverse selection. Although the usage of dark pools is primarily driven by the urge to reduce information leakage, the perception has however grown that even dark pools might leak sensitive information, leading to increased adverse selection. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate whether dark pools do offer institutional investors the possibility to trade orders with less adverse selection compared to lit markets, and if so, to what extent. DATA AND METHODOLOGY: The incidence of adverse selection in lit markets and dark pools is investigated by looking at the stock price development around a Finnish asset management company's <b>resting</b> <b>order</b> fills, which are drawn from the company's algorithmic order flow. The unique data have made it possible for me to examine price moves even in the initial milliseconds around each lit and dark fill. Overall, the data set comprises 152, 261 lit market and 16, 044 dark pool fills, which occurred during continuous trading hours over the ten-month period from August 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013. All fills are in OMX Helsinki 25 stocks. The lit fills are executed in the Helsinki Stock Exchange and two multilateral trading facilities (MTFs). The dark fills are executed at the primary or the EBBO mid-price in 8 different European MTF dark pools. RESULTS: On average, resting orders are getting adversely selected on individual fills in both lit markets and dark pools. However, in dark pools there is less adverse selection, which is the case across the venues and fill size categories. Looking at the whole sample and the average price development over the one-minute post-fill time interval, in lit markets, adverse selection costs are around four times higher compared to dark pools. The stock price starting to move down (up), on average, in less than a second after a buy (sell) order gets filled in a lit market or dark pool is a possible indication of the actions of market participants trading at very high frequency...|$|E
