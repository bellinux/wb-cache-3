The study explored the effects of subjective evaluation and personality attitudes (BIS/BAS: Behavioural Inhibition and Activation System) on brain oscillations, in response to some consumer goods relative to different commercial brands.

40|$|The present {{neuromarketing}} research {{aimed at}} detecting changes in brain activity {{in response to}} commercial stimuli and goods to understand the impact of neurophysiological measures on marketing efficacy. This study explored the effects of subjective evaluation (self-report measures) and personality attitudes (BIS/BAS: Behavioural Inhibition and Activation System) on brain oscillation (Alpha, Beta, Theta, Gamma), in response to some consumer goods relative to different commercial sectors (alimentary, pharmaceutical, electronic, financial, clothing). Greater attention {{was given to the}} left DLPFC, an important area in decision-making processes. We adopted a combined rTMS (low-frequency 1 Hz on left and right DLPFC) and elettroencephalography (EEG) approach to determine the consumers’ (N = twenty-four) response during the vision of five commercials. Two control conditions were included in the experimental design to control both the simple inhibition effect (SHAM condition with absence of TMS stimulation) and the localization effect (control site condition, with the two half of the sample receiving either F 3 or F 4 stimulation). After the stimulation (TMS/SHAM) subjects evaluated goods and they were required to express their preferences by using semantic differential. The results showed higher left DLPFC theta activity in relationship to subjects with higher rewarding trait (BAS-Reward) during the vision of emotionally involving commercials independently from the valence of the good (more preferred and <b>rejected</b> <b>goods).</b> Moreover, some commercials engaged consumers and induced them to choose and prefer their goods, if compared to others. Specifically, theta modulation supported consumer’s engagement, showing significant differences between some commercials (i. e. “Samsung”, “Barilla”). Probably these brands were able to engage consumers, by inducing them to choose and prefer their products.

30|$|The holding cost is {{explicitly}} {{assumed to be}} varying over time in only few inventory models. Giri et al. (1996) considered a generalized EOQ model for deteriorating items here in which the demand rate, deterioration rate, holding cost and ordering cost are all assumed to be continuous functions of time. Ferguson et al. (2007) considered {{a variation of the}} economic order quantity (EOQ) model where cumulative holding cost is a nonlinear function of time. They showed how it is an approximation of the optimal order quantity for perishable goods, such as milk, and produce, sold in small to medium size grocery stores where there are delivery surcharges due to infrequent ordering, and managers frequently utilize markdowns to stabilize demand as the product’s expiration date nears (Ferguson et al. 2007). Also, they showed how the holding cost curve parameters can be estimated via a regression approach from the product’s usual holding cost (storage plus capital costs), lifetime, and markdown policy (Ferguson et al. 2007). Alfares (2007) considered the inventory policy for an item with a stock level-dependent demand rate and a storage time-dependent holding cost. The holding cost per unit of the item per unit time is assumed to be an increasing function of the time spent in storage. Two time-dependent holding cost step functions are considered: retroactive holding cost increase, and incremental holding cost increase. Procedures are developed for determining the optimal order quantity and the optimal cycle time for both cost structures. Ray and Chaudhuri (1997) took the time value of money into account in analyzing an inventory system with stock-dependent demand rate and shortages. Two types of inflation rates are considered: internal (company) inflation, and external (general economy) inflation. Shao et al. (2000) determined the optimum quality target for a manufacturing process where several grades of customer specifications may be sold. Since <b>rejected</b> <b>goods</b> could be stored and sold later to another customer, variable holding costs are considered in the model. Beltran and krass (2002) analyzed a version of the dynamic lot size (DLS) model where demands can be positive and negative and disposals of excess inventory are allowed. Assuming deterministic time-varying demands and concave holding costs, an efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed for this finite time horizon problem. Goh (1992) apparently provides the only existing inventory model in which the demand is stock dependent and the holding cost is time dependent. Actually, he considered two types of holding cost variation: (1) a nonlinear function of storage time and (2) a nonlinear function of storage level (Goh 1992).|$|E

40|$|How do {{the errors}} of {{regulators}} – approving bad products, or <b>rejecting</b> <b>good</b> ones – {{depend upon the}} submission strategies and characteristics of submitting private entities or firms? We develop a model of approval regulation in which both firm and regulator are uncertain about the underlying quality of a product, but where the firm is better informed than the regulator. The model predicts that the commission of regulatory error depends heavily upon the induced submission strategies of firms, and in particular {{on the amount of}} time that firms take to experiment with their products before submitting them. Specifically, our analysis predicts that when experimentation is short and experimental costs are high, Type I errors (approving bad products) should be disproportionately associated with products submitted by firms with lower experimentation costs (larger firms), and Type II errors (<b>rejecting</b> <b>good</b> products) should be concentrated among products submitted by smaller firms. However, when experimentation is long and experimental costs are low, Type I errors should be concentrated among small firms, while Type II errors will be concentrated among larger firms. Under all conditions Type I errors should be increasing in the cost of regulatory submission, and the inverse should be true for Type II errors. We test hypotheses from the model in a statistical analysis of regulatory errors committed by the FDA in the approval of new pharmaceutical products...|$|R
30|$|Producer error {{comes from}} {{the idea that the}} {{producer}} suffers more from the rejection of good lots than the acceptance of bad ones. To calculate producer risk, the producer must decide upon the value of AQL. If p ≤ AQL, then the batch is defined as good, and likewise, if p > AQL lots are considered non-compliant. Well-chosen AQL and corresponding sampling plans reduce producer risk and therefore increase the probability of not <b>rejecting</b> <b>good</b> lots. The producer should offer items that bring high levels of satisfaction to the consumer and consequently renewed contracts. This means that AQL should always be less than LTPD.|$|R

30|$|In {{traditional}} acceptance sampling, consumer risk {{has been}} exclusively {{the subject of}} the consumer, and producer risk {{the subject of the}} producer. Nonetheless, there is no conceptual reason to restrict each risk factor to only one adversary in the negotiation process. Logically, {{there is no reason why}} the producer should not recognize and react to the probability of accepting the bad lot what has been called up to now consumer risk. Accepting the bad lot is certainly a problem for the producer, however, as described earlier a problem of secondary intensity. Likewise, <b>rejecting</b> the <b>good</b> lot and committing a false positive is also a problem for the consumer but of only moderate intensity. From the viewpoint of the consumer we have, LTPDc and P(LTPDc) and furthermore AQLc and P(AQLc). 8 Here the consumer feels both risks, primarily the probability of accepting bad lots P(LTPDc), and less intensely the probability of <b>rejecting</b> <b>good</b> lots [1  − P(AQLc)]. The consumer can and should construct his sampling plan using both risks recognizing that less consumer risk should be his objective since its repercussions are more costly, while he tolerates more secondary risk. Specifically, the consumer, for example, could use a P(LTPDc) of 3 % and a [1  − P(AQLc)] of 10 %.|$|R

50|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the CDM is in judging whether or not projects truly make additional savings in GHG emissions (Carbon Trust, 2009, p. 54-56). The baseline which is used in making this comparison is not observable. According to the Carbon Trust (2009), some projects have been clearly additional: the fitting of equipment to remove HFCs and N2O. Some low-carbon electricity supply projects were also thought to have displaced coal-powered generation. Carbon Trust (2009) reviewed some approved projects. In their view, some of these projects had debatable points in their additionality assessments. They compared establishing additionality to the balance of evidence in a legal system.
