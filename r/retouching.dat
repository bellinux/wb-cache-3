40|$|The {{relative}} {{amount of}} <b>retouch</b> on stone tools {{is central to}} many archaeological studies linking stone tool assemblages to broader issues of human social and economic land-use strategies. Unfortunately, most <b>retouch</b> measures deal with flake and blade tools and few (if any) {{have been developed for}} hafted bifaces and projectile points. This paper introduces a new index for measuring and comparing amount of <b>retouch</b> on hafted bifaces and projectile points that can be applied regardless of size or typological variance. The <b>retouch</b> index is assessed initially with an experimental data set of hafted bifaces that were dulled and resharpened on five occasions. The <b>retouch</b> index is then applied to a hafted biface assemblage made from tool stone that has been sourced by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Results of both assessments show that the hafted biface <b>retouch</b> index (HRI) is effective for determining the amount of <b>retouch</b> {{and the degree to which}} the hafted bifaces have been curated.

5|$|Later {{copies of}} the second state, with minor <b>retouching,</b> were also printed from the plate by Thomas Cotes in 1632, for Robert Allot's Second Folio, a new edition of the {{collected}} plays. It was also reused in later folios, although by then the plate was beginning to wear out and was heavily re-engraved. The original plate was still being used into the 1660s, and then disappears. Already in 1640 William Marshall had copied and adapted the design on a new plate for John Benson's edition of Shakespeare's sonnets. All subsequent engraved reprintings of the portrait were made by later engravers copying the original printed image.|$|E

The Florence canvas is in relatively poor condition: <b>retouching</b> has largely removed Dürer's top layer of brushwork and left the paint hard and dry. Barbara's panel underwent a restoration in 1974, when the surface was cleaned and partially revarnished, with repairs to damage on the reverse sustained from woodboring.|$|E
5|$|The restorers {{washed the}} {{surfaces}} {{using a variety}} of solvents. Distilled water was used wherever possible to remove soot and dissolve water-soluble gums. <b>Retouching</b> and repainting that had been part of previous later restorations were removed with a gelatinous solvent, applied in several stages for measured times, and washed with distilled water. Salt efflorescences of calcium carbonate were treated by the application of a solution of dimethylformamide. The final step was the application of a weak solution of acrylic polymer to consolidate and protect the surface, and further washing.|$|E

50|$|<b>Retouch</b> {{may simply}} consist of roughly {{trimming}} an edge by striking with a hammerstone, or on smaller, finer flake or blade tools {{it is sometimes}} carried out by pressure flaking. Other forms of <b>retouch</b> may include burination, which is <b>retouch</b> that is conducted in a parallel orientation to the flake margin. <b>Retouch</b> is often taken {{as one of the}} most obvious features distinguishing a tool from a waste by-product of lithic manufacture (debitage).|$|R

5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by <b>retouching</b> the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E

50|$|This {{is quite}} simply a {{description}} of where exactly the <b>retouch</b> {{is located on the}} flake. The key here is to be very specific. The <b>retouch</b> extensiveness for each area should also be described. This entails whether the <b>retouch</b> is total or partial. Proper flake terminology should be used in these descriptions.|$|R
5000|$|This method uses {{measurements}} of flake thickness and {{the height of}} <b>retouch</b> scars to produce a ratio between 0 and 1 of the index of reduction. In the original publication on GIUR by Kuhn (1990), scars are measured at three points (t) along the <b>retouched</b> edge (usually at proximal, medial, and distal points) and then divided by the overall thickness (T) to produce this ratio. The equation is GIUR= ((t1+t2+t3)/3)/T. However, scholars have recently revised Kuhn's methods by measuring T at each point t is measured. The updated calculation is GIUR= (t1/T1+ t2/T2 + t3/T3)/3. The new method creates more data points and may erase biases caused by high variation in artefact thickness. Typically, higher GIUR values indicate more invasive or extensive <b>retouch.</b> Calipers {{can be used to}} measure the height of the <b>retouch</b> scar or a goniometer can be used to measure the angle of the <b>retouch</b> and the height can be calculated with the equation t=D sin(a), where [...] "D" [...] is scar length and [...] "a" [...] is angle of <b>retouch.</b> Limitations of the GIUR are its restriction to use on unifacially <b>retouched</b> flakes and that as values increase, they are less able to accurately represent mass loss, because once <b>retouch</b> meets or succeeds the dorsal spine, t/T ratios decline ...|$|R

25|$|These hand axes {{have a more}} {{balanced}} appearance as the modification consists of a second (or third) series of blows to make the piece more uniform and provide a better finish. The modification is often called <b>retouching</b> and is sometimes carried out using invasive <b>retouching</b> or using softer, marginal, shallow blows that are only applied to the most marked irregularities leaving scale-like marks. The modification of edges with a hard hammer was carried out {{from the beginning of}} the Acheulean and persisted into the Musterian. It is therefore not mya useful as an indicator of chronology (in order for it to be considered as a marker it has to be accompanied by other complementary and independent archaeological data. The hand axes arising from this methodology have a more classical profile with either a more symmetrical almond or oval shape and with a lower proportion of the cortex of the original core. It is not always the case that the <b>retouching</b> had the objective of reducing an edge's irregularities or deformities, in fact, it has been shown that in some cases the <b>retouching</b> was carried out to sharpen an edge that had been blunted by use or a point that had deteriorated.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{suggested}} that the hand axe was not itself a tool, but a core from which flakes had been removed and used as tools (flake core theory). However, hand axes are often found with <b>retouching</b> such as sharpening or shaping, casting doubt on this idea.|$|E

50|$|Through ethnographic {{research}} in Central Australia, Hiscock found that <b>retouch</b> may be conducted on a flake that is ultimately rejected {{as a tool}} for use. This shows that <b>retouch</b> may, in some cases, not be a sign of extending the use life of a tool. It may simply be an attempt to make a tool viable for use {{in the first place and}} can indicate that particular tool’s unsuitability for use. This calls into question many of the basic assumptions made based on <b>retouch</b> and suggests that archaeologists may need to rethink exactly what <b>retouch</b> may mean.|$|R

For this study, a <b>retouch</b> index was developed and evaluated on an experimental assemblage of bifaces.

50|$|<b>Retouch</b> is {{the act of}} {{producing}} scars on a stone flake after the ventral surface has been created. It {{can be done to}} the edge of an implement {{in order to make it}} into a functional tool, or to reshape a used tool. <b>Retouch</b> can be a strategy to reuse an existing lithic artifact and enable people to transform one tool into another tool. Depending on the form of classification that one uses, it may be argued that <b>retouch</b> can also be conducted on a core-tool, if such a category exists, such as a hand-axe.|$|R
25|$|In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, {{they could}} have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it is {{misleading}} to think of them as axes, {{they could have}} been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through <b>retouching.</b>|$|E

Any other alterings should be considered not as <b>retouch</b> but as an arrangement. The analyzed score material comprises classical to mid 20 th century repertoire. This thesis explores the useof <b>retouches</b> with regard to historical development of orchestral style. Futhermore the scanning field is limited to the Czech orchestral practice.
