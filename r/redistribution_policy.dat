40|$|As {{democracy}} spreads, {{the importance}} of <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> is believed to increase, bringing with them the threat of weakening incentives and slowing growth. Yet, to date the determinants of <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> have rarely been investi-gated outside a few OECD countries and outside the context of narrowly defined transfer payments. This paper examines the determinants of a broader cl;~ss of <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies,</b> namely, the share of public spending on health, education and welfare in total government spending in a larger set of countries (a panel data set consisting of 105 countries) over the period 1988 - 2000. In particular. the paper views redistributive spending as emanating from two global 1. -rends: cleregulation of interna-tional capital movenlents {{and the spread of}} democratic institutions. Our basic hypothesis is that because of the risks involved in international capital]nobility and the fact that their use of standard macroeconomic policies is increasingly limited by international rules of the game, governments find redistribu-tive spending policies convenient tools for dealing with the distributive effects inherent in these risks, especially when financial crises actually occur. 'The results, with both fixed arid random effects models, support most of the: hypotheses, several of them quite strongly...|$|R

40|$|The intratemporal {{redistribution}} {{feature of}} the welfare state makes it an attractive destination for immigrants, particularly for low-skill immigrants. George Borjas (1994) reports that foreign-born households in the United States accounted for 10 percent of households receiving public assistance in 1990, and for 13 percent of total cash assisitance distributed, even though they constituted only 8 percent of all households in the United States. In this chapter we explore the implications of various <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> for the attitude of the native-born towards migrants. We analyze the effect of migration on the shape and magnitude of <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> that are determined in a political economy equilibrium; at the same time, we address the question whether the level of migration, when not restricted, is higher or lower in this welfare state than in the laissez-faire (no-redistribution) economy. ...|$|R

50|$|Increasingly, as land {{privatization}} {{leads to}} the end of communal lands, women find themselves unable to use any land not bestowed upon them by their families, rendering unmarried women and widows vulnerable. Many women still face legal hurdles when attempting to acquire land through inheritance or the marketplace. In order to reorganize post-colonial societies, SADC states have engaged in land redistribution and resettlement programs, ranging from temporary lease-holding to permanent property rights. Even in cases where no gender bias is officially present in land <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy,</b> social custom permits officials to favor male-headed households and individual men over female-headed households and individual women.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we intend to}} study how {{the quality of the}} {{institutional}} factor may influence the efficiency of <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> specifically associated with human capital accumulation. We develop a conceptual discussion building on the importance of income redistribution for economic growth and the key role of political institutions in securing growth-enhancing redistribution policies. We introduce endogenous growth theory elements into our analysis by considering as a fundamental source of economic growth human capital accumulation, motivated by tax-financed education secured through efficient redistribution policies. We outline crucial insights on the underlying mechanisms, emphasizing however that extensive research on the subject is undoubtedly still required. In particular, we identify the main factors negatively affecting the decisive role of political institutions and, consequently, distorting efficient <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy.</b> We then define a political-economic equilibrium as a combination of intermediately strong state and efficient control-rights institutions, implying simultaneous protection from expropriation and implementation of efficient <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy,</b> conducive to sustained economic growth. <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy,</b> human capital, institutions, taxation, public education, economic growth...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{examine how}} the {{specific}} nature of economic integration in the European Union has affected member states' <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> {{over the last two}} decades. More precisely, I attempt to detail the effect of social-tax competition between member states within social mod-els, processes that I label "races to bottoms. " In this framework, I identify the emergence of an informal set of rules effectively constraining national <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> in different ways, given the diversity of tax-social compacts in the EU. Because these rules are implicit and their ef-fect generally underestimated, I gather them under the notion of "shadow" social Europe. Hav-ing empirically assessed the impact of this dynamic on the "continental," the "Nordic," the "eastern" and the "liberal" social-tax compact, I finally try to present a normative perspective and some policy options on this matter...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} how income inequality affects social welfare {{in a model}} of voluntary contributions to multiple pure public goods. Itaya, de Meza, and Myles (1997) show that the maximization of social welfare precludes income equality in a single pure public good model. In contrast, we show that the result of Itaya et al. may not be valid {{in a case of}} multiple voluntarily supplied public goods; specifically, we show that not only an income inequality-raising <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> but also an income-equalizing one may raise social welfare. We also show that if altruistically motivated voluntary transfers are allowed, an inequality-raising <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> is no longer effective and leaves social welfare unchanged...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with evaluating the principles of, and approaches to, contemporary land redistribution programmes. Using contemporary South African land <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> as a case study, it examines the policy process of a land reform programme. This enables {{an assessment of the}} extent to which policy implementation difficulties that are often experienced are the result of flawed policy conceptualisation and/or policy development, rather than simply poor policy implementation. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in South Africa between 1998 and 2001, the thesis provides the first full account of the policy process for contemporary South African land <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy.</b> This account identifies many of the broader political and contextual factors that help explain why and how the policy process evolved as it did, and adds to previous academic research on the extent to which competing political agendas affected the policy process. The main argument of the thesis is that the policy process for conceptualising, developing and implementing land <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> between 1994 and 2001 was flawed. The thesis contrasts theoretical models of a policy process with models of the actual policy processes observed in South Africa during this period, in order to identify how and why the policy process was flawed. It proposes that the policy process was influenced primarily by competing political agendas that weakened and hindered the policy conceptualisation and policy development stages of the process, resulting in a land <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> that was both difficult to implement and unable to meet the challenge of rural poverty it was meant to help alleviate...|$|E
40|$|Particular {{demographic}} {{groups are}} {{often associated with}} distinct points of view across various dimensions of <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy.</b> In this paper, we investigate which demographic groups account for heterogeneity in views on welfare policy and views on appropriate levels of overall redistribution. Using data from the General Social Survey and classification tools, we find evidence that classifications of the population by race, socioeconomic status, and age have some predictive power. However, much heterogeneity in views on <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> persists even within these demographic groupings and remains unexplained. Our results suggest that identity-based explanations for variations in these views have to be interpreted with caution.

40|$|This paper studies a {{model of}} optimal <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> in which agents face {{unemployment}} risk and in which savings may provide partial self-insurance. Moral hazard arises as job search effort is unobservable. The optimal <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> provide new insights into how an unemployment insurance scheme should be designed: First, the unemployment insurance policy is recursive in an agent's wealth level, and thus independent of {{the duration of the}} unemployment spell. Second, the level of benefit payments is negatively related to the agent's asset position. The reason behind the latter result is twofold; in addition to the first-order insurance effect of wealth, an increase in non-labor income (wealth) amplifies the opportunity cost of employment and thus reduces the agent's incentive to search for a job. During unemployment the agent decumulates assets and the sequence of benefit payments is observationally increasing - a result that stands in sharp contrast with previous studies.

40|$|In this paper, {{a simple}} model is {{proposed}} to endogenize voting behavior that incorporates {{a sense of}} duty to vote. We assume that {{a sense of duty}} to vote is an increasing function of a person's human capital and the public faith in politics, and those with a higher sense of duty often vote. Then, we examine the relationship between income <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> and human capital accumulation. From our assumption, the voter turnout is expected to gradually increase as human capital accumulates. However, we show that, in some cases, the positive relationship between voter turnout and human capital accumulation is not necessarily hold. In addition, the effect of growing inequality on the <b>redistribution</b> <b>policy</b> is investigated. Voter turnout, Human capital, Income distribution, Redistribution...|$|E

40|$|The ?prospect of upward mobility?

This result holds provided the mobility process is concave in expectations, <b>redistribution</b> <b>policies</b> are expected to last for a sufficiently long period and individuals are not too risk averse. This paper tests the POUM hypothesis {{by means of a}} within subjects experiment where the concavity of the mobility process, the degree of social mobility, the knowledge of personal income and the degree of inequality are used as treatments. Other determinants of the demand for redistribution, such as risk aversion and inequality aversion are (partially) controlled for via either the experiment design or the information collected during the experiment. We find that the POUM hypothesis holds under alternative specifications, even when we control for individual fixed effects...|$|R

In a two-country model we assume that after Turkish accession, the European household gives a transfer to the Turkish household whereas an upwart TFP shift arises in Turkey due to the positive effect of accession on institutional development. We first find that a TFP increase in Turkey compensates the cost of transfer. Second, allowing for free capital mobility before accession turns out to be unfavorable for admission to the EU.
