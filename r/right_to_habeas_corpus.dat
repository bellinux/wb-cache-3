25|$|Justice Antonin Scalia's dissent, {{joined by}} Justice John Paul Stevens, went the furthest in restricting the {{executive}} power of detention. Scalia asserted {{that based on}} historical precedent, the government had only two options to detain Hamdi: either Congress must suspend the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>habeas</b> <b>corpus,</b> or Hamdi must be tried under normal criminal law. Scalia wrote that the plurality, though well-meaning, had no basis in law for trying to establish new procedures that would be applicable in a challenge to Hamdi's detention - {{it was only the}} job of the Court to declare it unconstitutional and order his release or proper arrest, rather than to invent an acceptable process for detention.|$|E

First offenders confined to the Model Jail were not always segregated from hardened criminals, a pattern that prevailed throughout most of the prison system.

25|$|Gonzales helped {{draft the}} January, 2002 Presidential Order which {{authorized}} {{the use of}} military tribunals to try terrorist suspects. The order arrogated to the President the power to hold any non-citizen who he deemed a terrorist, or accessory to a terrorist, in military detention and subject to trial before a military commission. Subsequently the United States Department of Defense (DOD) organized military tribunals to judge charges against enemy combatant detainees being held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp.

5000|$|Dallas’s {{report of}} the case {{includes}} a footnote that makes mention of a <b>habeas</b> <b>corpus</b> statute enacted on February 18, 1705.

[...] However, the language of the Pennsylvania act is unknown, and {{it may not have been}} in effect in any case. The British crown frequently repealed such colonial enactments. [...] At any rate, Dallas’s report includes so little of the detail of the case, including the charges laid, the date of Haas’s arrest, or the date the indictment came down, that no meaningful <b>habeas</b> <b>corpus</b> analysis is possible. Nor is it possible to determine whether Haas sought a speedy trial.

5000|$|In the United States, {{a person}} is {{protected}} by the federal constitution from being held in prison unlawfully. The right to have one's detention reviewed by a judge is called habeas corpus. The U.S. Constitution states that [...] "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it".

50|$|However, {{the most}} recent case law {{development}} {{has been in the}} US Supreme Court case Boumediene v.

It also held that the Guantanamo detainees were entitled to the legal protections of the US Constitution and from then on, the Combatant Status Review Tribunal would be inadequate.

Lincoln's dictatorial actions included directly ordering the arrest and detention of dissenters and the suspension of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> writs of <b>Habeas</b> <b>Corpus.</b> Yet Lincoln remained subject to Congressional oversight, judicial review and periodic elections.|$|R
50|$|The {{nature of}} {{international}} human rights law has been seemingly altered by Americans since {{the attacks on the}} twin towers on September 11, 2001. The Guantanamo Bay detention camp is one example of recent developments that seem to disregard long standing human rights. The United States of America (USA) has pursued a ‘seemingly deliberate strategy’ to put suspected terrorists outside the reach of <b>habeas</b> <b>corpus</b> protections. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay serves as the location for a United States military prison in Cuba designed for the detention of non-citizens suspected of terrorist activity. At the time of its creation President Bush stated that its purpose was to respond to serious war crimes, primarily ‘a new way to deal with terrorists'. The first camp was set up 3 months after the attacks on the twin towers and since then a human rights debate has begun over the legality of denying detainees the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> petition <b>habeas</b> <b>corpus.</b>|$|R
