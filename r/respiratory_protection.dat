50|$|When this {{downdraft}} of cold air, or downburst, {{reaches the}} ground, it blows dry, loose silt and clay (collectively, dust) {{up from the}} desert, creating a wall of sediment that precedes the storm cloud. This wall of dust can be up to 100 km wide and several kilometers in elevation. At their strongest, haboob winds often travel at 35 - 100 km/h, and they may approach {{with little or no}} warning. Often rain does not appear at ground level as it evaporates in the hot, dry air (a phenomenon known as virga). The evaporation cools the rushing air even further and accelerates it. Occasionally, when the rain does persist, it can contain a considerable quantity of dust. Severe cases are called mud storms.

40|$|Pulmonary {{complications}} {{are still}} the most frequent cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in postoperative period after thoracic surgery. One of the most significant complications is the infectious one, particularly pneumonia. Low respiratory tract can be the source of infection in postoperative period. If the protective lung system is impaired, infection can spread out. Pneumonia is very often caused by residual atelectasis. There is obvious connection between the noninfectious lung complication - atelectasis and the infectious complication - pneumonia. The low <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>protection</b> is crucial to prevent these complications. We emphasize bronchoscopic removal of bronchial secretion together with obtaining the sputum for microbiological assessment. The goal is to prevent postoperative infectious complications and enable exact early administration of antibiotics due to known microbial agents. It is important to disclose possible complications and indicate preoperative and particularly postoperative care. Respiratory interventions, breathing excercises, epidural analgesia and exact administering antibiotics in prophylactic and therapeutic dosage play the pivotal role in prevention of postoperative pulmonary complications.

40|$|Administration of {{vaccines}} by {{the nasal}} route has recently {{proven to be}} one of the most efficient ways for inducing both mucosal and systemic antibody responses in experimental animals. Our results demonstrate that P 40, a well-defined outer membrane protein A from Klebsiella pneumoniae, is indeed a carrier molecule suitable for nasal immunization. Using fragments from the respiratory syncytial virus subgroup A (RSV-A) G protein as antigen models, it has been shown that P 40 is able to induce both systemic and mucosal immunity when fused or coupled to a protein or a peptide and administered intranasally (i. n.) to naive or K. pneumoniae-primed mice. Confocal analyses of nasal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue after i. n. instillation of P 40 showed that this molecule is able to cross the nasal epithelium and target CD 11 c-positive cells likely to be murine dendritic cells or macrophages. More importantly, this targeting of antigen-presenting cells following i. n. immunization with a subunit of the RSV-A molecule in the absence of any mucosal adjuvant results in both upper and lower <b>respiratory</b> tract <b>protection</b> against RSV-A infection...|$|R

The incidence of abnormally slow nasal mucociliary transport time (> 30 minutes) in patients was significantly higher than in controls of the same age.

40|$|Proof-of-concept {{studies suggest}} that current defences against {{smallpox}} could be strengthened by supplementing vaccination with antiviral drug prophylaxis, based on aerosolized or orally available forms of the long-acting medication cidofovir. Delivery of aerosolized cidofovir to mice results in its prolonged retention in <b>respiratory</b> tissues and <b>protection</b> against lethal intranasal or aerosol poxviral challenge. Although cidofovir itself is not orally available, the addition of an alkoxyalkanol ether side-chain allows it to be absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. This also markedly increases its antiviral activity and lengthens its intracellular half-life from roughly 3 to 8 – 10 days. Oral treatment also pro-tected mice against lethal poxviral challenge. These results suggest that a single aerosol dose of cido-fovir (or an alkoxyalkanol–ether derivative) could provide prolonged protection against initiation of smallpox infection, whereas oral treatment could prevent both initiation of infection and internal dis-semination of virus. Both approaches may avoid the nephrotoxicity that occasionally results from intravenous cidofovir therapy...|$|R

40|$|Setting: Outpatient {{rehabilitation}} center. Patient: An 84 -year-old man {{presented with}} an 8 -month history of nonsevere dysphagia that was experienced only with solid foods {{in a patient}} with {{diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis}} (DISH) or Forestier’s disease of the cervical spine. An episode of pneumonia occurred in the third and sixth months previously and the patient had been admitted to hospital and treated with antibiotics. Case Description: The patient was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (10 mg aceclofenac QID, maintained for 2 wk/mo), a soft diet, and rehabilitation treatment (active exercises to strengthen the swallowing musculature and effortful swallow, exercises for coordinating swallowing and breathing, for strengthening the <b>respiratory,</b> airflow <b>protection</b> maneuvers to produce safer swallowing, improve airway protection, and pharyngeal and laryngeal function, etc). Assessment/Results: At follow-up 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30 months after starting medical and rehabilitation treatment, the patient was still able to maintain an adequate oral food intake with no signs of aspiration or clinical complications. Discussion: This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, which describes a long follow-up in the dysphagia post-DISH. The dysphagia was hypothesized to be caused by mechanical compression and inflammatory changes accompanied by fibrosis in the esophagus wall. The aspiration pneumonia probably had multifactorial etiology: dysphagia, abnormal cough reflex, colonization of the oropharynx and virulent bacteria, etc. We believe that the durable improvement in our patient dysphagia is due to the combined use of medical and rehabilitation treatment. Conclusions: This case illustrates that cervical spinal abnormalities, such as Forestier’s disease, may be potentially treatable causes of aspiration pneumonia...|$|R
40|$|Acute {{epiglottitis}} is {{a potentially}} life threatening disease, {{with a growing}} incidence in the adult population. Its long-term outcome after Intensive Care Unit (ICU) hospitalization has rarely been studied. Thirty-four adult patients admitted for acute epiglottitis were included in this retrospective multicentric study. The mean age was 44 ± 12 years (sex ratio: 5. 8). Sixteen patients (47 %) {{had a history of}} smoking while 8 (24 %) had no previous medical history. The average time of disease progression before ICU was 2. 6 ± 3. 6 days. The main reasons for hospitalization were continuous monitoring (17 cases, 50 %) and acute respiratory distress (10 cases, 29 %). Microbiological documentation could be made in 9 cases (26 %), with Streptococcus spp. present in 7 cases (21 %). Organ failure at ICU admission occurred in 8 cases (24 %). Thirteen patients (38 %) required respiratory assistance during ICU stay; 9 (26 %) required surgery. Two patients (6 %) died following hypoxemic cardiac arrest. Five patients (15 %) had sequelae at 1 year. Patients requiring respiratory assistance had a longer duration of symptoms and more frequent anti inflammatory use before ICU admission and sequelae at 1 year (p < 0. 05 versus non-ventilated patients). After logistic regression analysis, only exposure to anti-inflammatory drugs before admission was independently associated with airway intervention (OR, 4. 96; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 23. 16). The profile of the cases consisted of young smoking men with little comorbidity. Streptococcus spp. infection represented the main etiology.

40|$|Despite {{the use of}} bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) {{for almost}} a century, {{pulmonary}} tuberculosis (TB) {{continues to be a}} serious global health concern. Therefore, there has been a pressing need for the development of new booster vaccines to enhance existing BCG-induced immunity. Protection following mucosal intranasal immunisation with AdHu 5 Ag 85 A is associated with the localisation of antigen-specific T-cells to the lung airway. However, parenteral intramuscular immunisation is unable to provide protection despite the apparent presence of antigen-specific T-cells in the lung interstitium. Recent advances in intravascular staining have allowed us to reassess the previously established T-cell distribution profile and its relationship with the observed differential <b>protection.</b> <b>Respiratory</b> mucosal immunisation empowers T-cells to home to both the lung interstitium and the airway lumen, whereas intramuscular immunisation-activated T-cells are largely trapped within the pulmonary vasculature, unable to populate the lung interstitium and airway.

40|$|Despite the {{availability}} of an inactivated vaccine that has been licensed for > 50 years, the influenza virus continues to cause morbidity and mortality worldwide. Constant evolution of circulating influenza virus strains {{and the emergence of}} new strains diminishes the effectiveness of annual vaccines that rely on a match with circulating influenza strains. Thus, there is a continued need for new, efficacious vaccines conferring cross-clade protection to avoid the need for biannual reformulation of seasonal influenza vaccines. Recombinant virus-vectored vaccines are an appealing alternative to classical inactivated vaccines because virus vectors enable native expression of influenza antigens, even from virulent influenza viruses, while expressed {{in the context of the}} vector that can improve immunogenicity. In addition, a vectored vaccine often enables delivery of the vaccine to sites of inductive immunity such as the <b>respiratory</b> tract enabling <b>protection</b> from influenza virus infection. Moreover, the ability to readily manipulate virus vectors to produce novel influenza vaccines may provide the quickest path toward a universal vaccine protecting against all influenza viruses. This review will discuss experimental virus-vectored vaccines for use in humans, comparing them to licensed vaccines and the hurdles faced for licensure of these next-generation influenza virus vaccines...|$|R
40|$|The humoral and {{cellular}} immune responses elicited by the trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) and the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) were evaluated in the ferret model, using newly developed ferret immunological reagents and assays. In {{contrast to the}} TIV, which only induced immune responses in primed animals, LAIV induced strong influenza virus–specific serum antibody and T-cell responses in both naive and influenza-seropositive animals. The LAIV offered significant protection against a heterologous H 1 N 1 virus challenge infection in the upper respiratory tract. Influenza virus–specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and influenza virus–specific CD 4 + and CD 8 + T cells were detected in the circulation and local paratracheal draining lymph nodes. The frequency of the influenza-specific ASCs in the local lymph nodes appeared to correlate with the degree of protection in the upper <b>respiratory</b> tract. The <b>protection</b> conferred by the LAIV could be attributed {{not only to the}} antibody response but also to the cell-mediated and local mucosal immune responses, particularly in naive ferrets.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of occupational biological risk is generally {{limited to the}} evaluation of a "potential exposure", without any quantitative estimate. The risk assessment output is then usually expressed as a level (low, medium, high) and represented in risk matrices combining magnitude and probability scores. A possible innovative approach for the risk assessment in occupational settings characterized by bioaerosol exposure is to monitor the air for a pathogen that can be further used for QMRA. Adenovirus is the virus that contains the highest amount of features favorable to its use as a virological indicator. This pathogenic virus has a low infectious dose, it is resistant on the environment, abundant, easily detected by molecular methods and is of great importance in public health. In this study, HAdV is used as the reference pathogen to develop a preliminary QMRA model to assess the microbial risk associated with the inhalation of contaminated bioaerosols. This model was then applied to data on air contamination from different settings (wastewater treatment plants, solid waste landfills, toilets in offices and hospitals) and with various exposure times. Air samples (1000 l of air in the indoor workplace and 3000 l of outdoor) were collected using an impactor sampler and the genomic concentration of positive samples was measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction (q-PCR). The virological monitoring showed the presence of HAdVs in all the considered settings, thus confirming their wide diffusion, nevertheless, the average concentrations of HAdV were different. The model estimates show that in the most contaminated settings a stay longer than 3 minutes {{would lead to a}} probability of infection of 100 %, while for the less contaminated areas even after 15 min the probability of infection remains around 1 %. The definition of critical exposure times, using a QMRA model, could be useful to give operational guidance for risk management on the use of <b>respiratory</b> personal <b>protection</b> equipment (RPPE). This approach is new and should be faced with caution. However it is worthy of discussion and further investigation...|$|R
