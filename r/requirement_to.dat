5|$|After {{extensive}} {{negotiations to}} implement a collateral structure open to all eurozone countries, on 4 October 2011, a modified escrow collateral agreement was reached. The expectation is that only Finland will utilise it, due, in part, to a <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> contribute initial capital to European Stability Mechanism in one instalment instead of five instalments over time. Finland, {{as one of the}} strongest AAA countries, can raise the required capital with relative ease.|$|E

5|$|At that time, Aspen was a faded {{mining town}} whose {{population}} had dwindled {{to fewer than}} a thousand. Later in the decade the first efforts to develop a ski resort began. They continued after World War II, and in the later decades of the 20th century the city began to grow again. Other than paving the road, CDOT was unable to undertake any significant improvements to the highway corridor due to its projects elsewhere {{in the state and}} the <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> coordinate efforts with the Forest Service, which owns most of the damaged land.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for {{different versions of the}} rule).|$|E

5|$|In the {{animated}} adaptations of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Syaoran is voiced by Miyu Irino in Japanese, and by Jason Liebrecht in English. Irino said that {{ever since the}} introduction of the original Syaoranwho he also voicedhe sometimes had problems voicing both characters. Fellow voice actress Yui Makino also discussed Irino's role, saying that he was the most difficult character to cast because of the <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> portray the two Syaorans.|$|E
5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, the <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as the <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} John Hale {{considered the}} original castle {{to form a}} transitional design between older medieval English designs and the newer Italian styles of defence. The design of Deal, like its sister castles along the Downs, suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to ever be fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively high profile, driven by the <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> support several tiers of defences, made it exposed to attack.|$|E

50|$|As the Minister did {{not have}} the ability to seize funds from either the trust account or the joint account (because the tax debt was solely in McLeod's name), he {{therefore}} focused on the cheques that had been issued, and issued three <b>requirements</b> <b>to</b> pay to Trustco. According <b>to</b> these <b>requirements,</b> Trustco was <b>to</b> pay to the Receiver General moneys otherwise payable to McLeod. In response <b>to</b> the <b>requirements</b> <b>to</b> pay, Trustco disputed its liability on the ground that it was “not indebted to the taxpayer alone”. The Minister assessed Trustco for the amounts of the cheques for failing to comply with the three <b>requirements</b> <b>to</b> pay. Trustco filed notices of objection. After they were rejected, it appealed to the Tax Court of Canada.|$|R
