One is conventional (traditional) and other is modern line (high speed). The difference between these two lines is due to the difference of drawing stages. In modern line mono-head high-speed type <b>draw</b> <b>frame</b> is in use, where in conventional line push-bar type <b>draw</b> <b>frame</b> is in use. The study was carried out to find out the effectiveness of the line in quality control of jute yarn.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} present {{research}} was to analyze the effect of draft, sliver hank and delivery speed {{on the quality of}} cotton yarn using different auto-leveller system at <b>draw</b> <b>frame.</b> <b>Drawing</b> is considered to be the key process in the whole set-up of yarn formation as all efficiency and quality of subsequent process depends upon the behavior of the sliver formed at drawing stage. In present research it is elaborated that during drawing, three factors are more important i. e. break draft, delivery speed and sliver hank. The best quality of yarn is obtained by controlling these factors. Rieter RSBD- 35 is better in performance as compared to Trutzschler HSR- 1000 which is efficient and modern autolevelling system with high speed servo drive motor at Rieter <b>draw</b> <b>frame.</b> The overall results show that moderate break draft, D 2 (1. 3), delivery speed S 2 (700 yards/min) and sliver hank H 2 (60 grain/yards) produced the better results...|$|R

These drawings were made in pen on tracing paper over a printout of a CÎ± trace of the atomic coordinates; they preserved positions, smoothed the backbone path, and incorporated small local shifts to disambiguate the visual appearance.

40|$|Abstract. Genetic {{programming}} {{was used}} to find out a mathematical model for drafting force from drafting process parameters on the <b>drawing</b> <b>frame,</b> which fits the experimental data as much as possible. The study used rayon fibers as the raw material in the mini-draw frame. The process parameters on the <b>draw</b> <b>frame</b> such as front roller speed, front roller draft, back roller speed and back roller draft as variables were investigated. The paper used the principle that there is linear relationship between drafting force and deformation from the strain gauges in the sensor. The data obtained from online measurement device was used for training and testing on the genetic programming. A comparison between experimental and predicted data was done. The results show very good agreement between the experimental and predicted values. Furthermore, this article shows that genetic programming can provide further use for setting up the machine process parameters without requiring {{an expert in the}} field...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{makes an}} attempt to {{evaluate}} final ranking of the alternatives proposed by two different approaches of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) in detecting the suitable spinning process variables for spun yarn intended {{to be used in}} knitting process. Performances of three variables in a <b>draw</b> <b>frame</b> were evaluated on the basis of seven quality parameters of the forty eight rotor yarns using technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions (TOPSIS) and vlseKriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje (VIKOR). Both methods are based on an aggregating function illustrating closeness to the ideal. Linear normalization and vector normalization are used in VIKOR and TOPSIS respectively to eliminate the units of criterion function. Difference in normalization technique affected final rankings as they introduced two different alternatives as the best. It means that, selecting appropriate MCDM method to rank feasible alternatives and accepting proposed yarn sample or process condition is related to the economical advantages and efficiency of the spinning and knitting processes.

These rovings (or slubbings) are then what are used in the spinning process.|$|R
