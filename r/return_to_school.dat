40|$|This paper {{examines}} economic <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for China’s Korean {{minority in}} the urban labour market using ordinary least squares (OLS) and two-stage least squares. The OLS estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> are similar <b>to</b> findings from recent studies for the Chinese urban labour market. We use father’s education, mother’s education and spouse’s education to instrument for education. The two-stage least squares estimates are considerably higher than the OLS estimates for <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and slightly higher than existing two-stage least squares estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the Chinese urban labour market. The two stage least squares estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the Korean minority living in urban areas are high compared with the Asian average and world average. The economic <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> reported in this study assists to explain why private demand for education among the Korean minority in China is strong and provides a justification for the Korean minority’s focus on educational attainment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> is {{a fundamental}} parameter of interest in many different areas of economics and public policy. The most common technique for estimating this parameter {{is based on the}} assumption that the ‘true’ coefficient of education in the earnings equation is constant across individuals. However, this may not often be wholly true and <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> estimates may be biased and inconsistent. The objective of this study was <b>to</b> estimate the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> as a random coefficient and obtain accurate and reliable estimates that will be useful for policy recommendations. The restricted maximum likelihood (REML) method was used to estimate the parameters of a random coefficient model using data from a 2007 / 2008 Ghanaian twins’ survey. The results revealed that the REML economic <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in three selected cities were between 7 % and 9 %.

40|$|This study {{provides}} {{the first set}} of estimates of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> over an extended period in Russia and Ukraine (1985 - 2002). There has been an increase in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in both countries but the increase is much bigger in Russia than in Ukraine. The intriguing question is why <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> in Russia and Ukraine diverged so much over the transition period while the skill composition of employment did not. Our approach in analyzing the sources of cross-country differences in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> is <b>to</b> compare the Mincerian earnings functions between the two countries and then to employ decomposition techniques. Using semiparametric methods, we construct counterfactual wage distributions for university and secondary school graduates for Ukraine using the distributions of Russian characteristics, <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> characteristics, and unobservables. This allows us to decompose differences in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> between the two countries due to differences in the labor market returns (price effect), differences in unobservables (residual effect), and differences in the labor force composition (composition effect). We conclude that of these three effects the price effect makes a major contribution to the observed differences in the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling...</b>|$|R

A hemophiliac, he became infected with HIV from a contaminated blood treatment and, when diagnosed in 1984, was given six months to live. Though doctors said he posed no risk to other students, AIDS was poorly understood at the time, and when White tried to <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>school,</b> many parents and teachers in Kokomo rallied against his attendance.

40|$|We {{estimate}} {{a structural}} dynamic programming model of schooling decisions and obtain individual specific {{estimates of the}} local (and average) <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> {{as well as the}} <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. Homogeneity of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> human capital is strongly rejected in favor of a discrete distribution version of the random coefficient specification. The results indicate that individuals who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> are also those who have the higher <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience. There is a 5. 9 percentage points difference in the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> at college graduation between high and low market ability individuals (2. 3 % vs 8. 2 %) and a 5. 4 percentage points difference in the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience upon entrance in the labor market (3. 1 % vs 8. 5 %). When averaged over all types, the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> experience in the early phase of the life cycle (6. 8 %) exceeds the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> (6. 4 % at college graduation). After conditioning on a specific type, the log wage regression function remains rather convex in schooling. The conflictual effects of the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and experience on schooling decisions imply weak dynamic self-selection; that is educational attainments are only weakly correlated with individual differences in the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling...</b>|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to estimate and compare the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> investments in education for men belonging to different parts of the ability distribution. Our ability measure is the achievement test score from the Swedish Military Enlistment Battery. By exploring the measurement error in the test score, i. e. the deviation from the true latent ability level of the individual, we try to predict the expected biases in the ”ability specific” <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> education, when using an achievement test as a proxy for ability. We find that a higher score on the Swedish Enlistment test is associated with a higher <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling.</b> The relationship between the <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> and the test score does however seem to be decreasing in the test score. Thus, it it primarily the ability specific <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> for the lower test groups that divert from the average <b>return</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling.</b> In general, the measurement errors in the test score do not seem to bring about any major biases in the ability specific <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} pace of {{increase}} in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> during the transition from planning to market over time across a number of Central and Eastern European countries, Russia, and China. We use metadata from 33 studies of 10 transition economies covering a period from 1975 through 2002. Our empirical model {{is an attempt to}} account for cross-section and over-time variation in rates of return {{as a function of the}} timing, speed, and volatility of reform processes as well as estimation methods used and sample characteristics. Our principal aim is to investigate the relative strength of two hypotheses: (1) the speed of economic transformation from planning to market represent the relaxation of legal, regulatory, and institutional constraints on wage-setting behavior, leading directly <b>to</b> adjustment <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> <b>to</b> market rates; 2) the rapid increase in <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> <b>schooling</b> during the early reform period reflects the ability of highly-educated individuals to respond to changing opportunities in a disequilibrium situation.
