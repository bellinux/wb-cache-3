40|$|In {{gradient}} descent learning algorithms such as error backpropagation, the learning rate parameter {{can have a}} significant effect on generalization accuracy. In particular, decreasing the learning <b>rate</b> below <b>that</b> which yields the fastest convergence can significantly improve generalization accuracy, especially on large, complex problems. The learning rate also directly affects training speed, but not necessarily in the way that many people expect. Many neural network practitioners currently attempt to use the largest learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> still allows for convergence, in order to improve training speed. However, a learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too large can be as slow as a learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too small, and a learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> is too large or too small can require orders of magnitude more training time than one that is in an appropriate range. This paper illustrates how the learning rate affects training speed and generalization accuracy, and thus gives guidelines on how to efficiently select a learning <b>rate</b> <b>that</b> maximizes generalization accuracy. ...|$|R

5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay <b>rates</b> <b>that</b> existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet is slowly cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained that few people were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had <b>rates</b> <b>that</b> were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E
