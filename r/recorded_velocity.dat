40|$|Several {{works have}} {{reported}} on the reconstruction of 2 D/ 3 D limb kinematics from low-frequency EEG signals using linear regression models based on positive correlation values between the recorded and the reconstructed trajectories. This paper describes the mathematical properties of the linear model and the correlation evaluation metric {{that may lead to}} a misinterpretation of the results of this type of decoders. Firstly, the use of a linear regression model to adjust the two temporal signals (EEG and velocity profiles) implies that the relevant component of the signal used for decoding (EEG) has {{to be in the same}} frequency range as the signal to be decoded (velocity profiles). Secondly, the use of a correlation to evaluate the fitting of two trajectories could lead to overly-optimistic results as this metric is invariant to scale. Also, the correlation has a non-linear nature that leads to higher values for sinus/cosinus-like signals at low frequencies. Analysis of these properties on the reconstruction results was carried out through an experiment performed in line with previous studies, where healthy participants executed predefined reaching movements of the hand in 3 D space. While the correlations of limb velocity profiles reconstructed from low-frequency EEG were comparable to studies in this domain, a systematic statistical analysis revealed that these results were not above the chance level. The empirical chance level was estimated using random assignments of <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles and EEG signals, as well as combinations of randomly generated synthetic EEG with <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles and recorded EEG with randomly generated synthetic velocit...|$|E

Spatially resolved measurements of transmitted waves demonstrate {{a strong correlation between}} the particle distribution and the ampli-tude/frequency of the fluctuating fields as revealed by wavelet analysis. At conditions near the onset of reaction, the resulting wave fields indicate that energy release evolves as a complex stochastic process. Detailed wave fields from numerical mesoscale simulations are probed using imaging and averaging techniques to determine statistical and mean properties of the shock fields. These methods provide the temporal and spatial variations of probabilistic distribution functions (PDF) of various wave fields that are key toward understanding the initiation and growth states of reaction in heterogeneous materials. Analysis of thermal fields has identified four aspects of the shock response associated with elastic-to-plastic deforma-tion, bulk loading, thermal gradients and ‘hot-spot ’ localization effects. Similar methods have also been applied to determine the variations of kinetic energy states and stress-strain distributions associated with the dispersive waves produced by shock loading the heterogeneous material. These new insights suggest that reactive waves are distinctly dif-ferent than the traditional models based on singular jump state analysis and new direc-tions based on PDF theory have been identified to link the mesoscale information to the continuum-level...|$|E

On our previous work (Aloui et al. 2011) CFD turbulent models were validated for flows crossing the critical angle (2 α= 16 °). Indeed, the PIV data base constructed was exploited to validate {{a variant of}} SST-RLC model. Taking into account the conical diffuser angle effect, the apparition {{and the development of}} vortices were observed and studied. The dynamics of the recirculation zones which may be observed at the lower and higher parts of the singularity, has not formed the subject of numerous studies. There were no studies that characterize the vortices at the conical diffusers in terms of size, centre positions, and vortex intensity. Consequently, two conical diffusers were studied using the Particle Image Velocimetry technique (PIV). The results illustrate effects of " opening angle " (2 α= 16 °) and (2 α= 30 °) on the flow structures developed in such type of diffusers. From such opening angle of conical diffusers, the progressive angle increasing generates a detachment of the boundary layer of the conical diffuser depending on the turbulence level. This detachment may lead to a coherent flow structures. We applied the coherent structures criterion Γ 2 to the <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> fields to detect and characterize the vortices at the conical diffusers.

Velocity data were averaged every 100 m and plotted against race distance and elevation to observe the presence of intra-lap variation. RESULTS: There {{was no significant difference}} in lap times (P = 0. 99) or lap velocity (P = 0. 65) across the 5 laps. Within each lap a high degree of oscillation in velocity was observed which broadly reflected changes in terrain, however high resolution data demonstrated additional non-monotonic variation not related to terrain. CONCLUSION: Participants adopted an even pace strategy across the 5 laps despite rapid adjustments in velocity during each lap. Whilst topographical and technical variations of the course accounted for some of the variability in velocity, the additional rapid adjustments in velocity may be associated with dynamic regulation of self-paced exercise...|$|E

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 High {{levels of}} {{scintillation}} caused by strong magnetic storms can cause GPS devices to lose {{connection with the}} necessary satellites. Current research has shown a correlation between major magnetic storms {{and higher levels of}} the recorded Total Electron Content (TEC) seen in GPS receivers. The research presented in this thesis examines the idea that observations from the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) can be used to predict scintillation levels in GPS receivers at polar latitudes by using GPS scintillation values σφ and S 4 that were collected from January, 2013 till November, 2015. These values were gathered from Poker Flat, Alaska, and McMurdo Station, Antarctica. Using various graphical methods the GPS data was compared with the <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity,</b> power and spectral width measurements from Kodiak, Alaska, and South Pole, Antarctica, SuperDARN sites. The SuperDARN values were ignored in the comparison if they did not fall within the specified GPS field of view, they were tagged with a ground scatter flag, or the data quality flag indicating they were erroneous. These bar and scatter graphs indicate that many of the irregularities identified by SuperDARN do not cause scintillation of a GPS signal. When the GPS scintillation variables are examined {{as a function of the}} SuperDARN signal parameters (power, velocity, and spectral width) only a small dependence is shown, demonstrating little correlation between the GPS scintillation variables and SuperDARN's variables. Based on these results SuperDARN cannot be used to predict higher levels of GPS scintillation in polar latitudes...|$|E
40|$|Testing of piles using high strain {{dynamic load}} testing using Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) {{has become very}} popular among Sri Lankan {{geotechnical}} engineers. In the high strain dynamic pile load testing, a pile instrumented at the top with accelerometers and strain gauges, is impacted with a heavy hammer to generate a large strain compression wave, which propagates along the pile shaft. The measured strain is converted to force using cross sectional area and elastic modulus of the pile, and acceleration is integrated into velocity. There are mainly two methods used {{in the analysis of}} the velocity and the force measurements at the pile top: (i) Case method - using the wave propagation theory and assuming linear elastic pile material, and dynamic soil properties; and (ii) CAPW AP method - using a combined wave equation soil model and a continuous pile model to iteratively determine the unknown soil parameters by matching the field <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> and force measurements at the pile top. The PDA operator in the field will use the Case method, with assumed Case damping factor (Jc) and wave velocity (C) to check the mobilized capacity under a given hammer blow and the integrity of the pile.

Thereafter, measured velocity and force records are down loaded to a computer and a more rigorous matching process is used to obtain more accurate strength and deformation characteristics of the pile tested.

The <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> measurements {{were compared to}} two moored ADCP’s that {{were placed in the}} channel of Muchalat near the base of its two sills. The classic Davis style drifter design was modified in this study and used for subsurface measurements at a depth of 30 m. Since this was the first known study to use Davis style drifters for subsurface measurements, the main objective was to characterize the performance of the drogued drifters using the moored ADCP to act as a ground truth. The surface component of the drifter incorporated the use of a handheld GPS unit to log its time and position while deployed. Four experiments were designed to evaluate the performance of the drogues with deployments on both flood and ebb tides and adjustment of the initial spacing of the drogues from 10, 25 and 50 m separation to resolve the impact of tidal forcing and across channel variability on the circulation in the channel. The commonality between all experiments was the velocity of the drogue being greater than the speed recorded by the ADCP from 0. 01 m/s to 0. 1 m/s. This suggests that the current was not the only mechanism forcing the drogue and other variables such as wind, stratification, GPS fix and drifter design were affecting the recorded data values. This implies that the surface area of the Davis drifter may not be large enough to accurately record subsurface measurements. University of Washington School of Oceanograph...|$|E

Systolic deformation (wall thickening, radial and longitudinal strain rate, and strain) of both sides were assessed. Furthermore, three patients with one sided abnormalities were studied.

In this normal population radial deformation was different for the left and right side of the septum (mean (SD) wall thickening on the left, 49 (46) %, and on the right, 17 (38) %; strain rate on the left, 3. 8 (0. 6) 1 /s, and on the right, 2. 1 (1. 9) 1 /s; strain on the left, 41 (17) %, and on the right, 22 (14) %), whereas longitudinal deformation was found to be similar (strain rate on the left, - 2. 2 (0. 7) 1 /s, and on the right, - 2. 0 (0. 6) 1 /s; strain on the left, - 28 (12) %, and on the right, - 25 (12) %).

Movement is best described by a shear failure of soil at residual shearing strength. Rheological models cannot explain the variations in movement rates with very slight changes in stress levels. Limit equilibrium methods with infinite slope and two-dimensional non-circular procedures are used in backanalysis for strength parameters. For both methods, back-calculated 4 is about 15 °, much lower than determined from laboratory testing. Phreatic level observed in three continuously recording piezometers does not correlate well with the annual start of slide movement, or movement rates.

40|$|Based upon theory, wall {{shear stress}} (WSS), an {{important}} determinant of endothelial function and gene expression, has been {{assumed to be}} constant along the arterial tree and the same in a particular artery across species. In vivo measurements of WSS, however, have shown that these assumptions are far from valid. In this survey we will discuss the assessment of WSS in the arterial system in vivo and present the results obtained in large arteries and arterioles. In vivo WSS can be estimated from wall shear rate, as derived from non-invasively <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> profiles, and whole blood viscosity in large arteries and plasma viscosity in arterioles, avoiding theoretical assumptions. In large arteries velocity profiles can be recorded {{by means of a}} specially designed ultrasound system and in arterioles via optical techniques using fluorescent flow velocity tracers. It is shown that in humans mean WSS is substantially higher in the carotid artery (1. 1 – 1. 3  Pa) than in the brachial (0. 4 – 0. 5  Pa) and femoral (0. 3 – 0. 5  Pa) arteries. Also in animals mean WSS varies substantially along the arterial tree. Mean WSS in arterioles varies between about 1. 0 and 5. 0  Pa in the various studies and is dependent on the site of measurement in these vessels. Across species mean WSS in a particular artery decreases linearly with body mass, e. g., in the infra-renal aorta from 8. 8  Pa in mice to 0. 5  Pa in humans. The observation that mean WSS is far from constant along the arterial tree implies that Murray’s cube law on flow-diameter relations cannot be applied to the whole arterial system. Because blood flow velocity is not constant along the arterial tree either, a square law also does not hold. The exponent in the power law likely varies along the arterial system, probably from 2 in large arteries near the heart to 3 in arterioles. The in vivo findings also imply that in in vitro studies no average shear stress value can be taken to study effects on endothelial cells derived from different vascular areas or from the same artery in different species. The cells have to be studied under the shear stress conditions they are exposed to in real life...|$|E
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{study has}} been undertaken aimed to highlighting the potentiality {{and the limits of}} SAR interferometry technique devoted to monitoring soil and structure movements, particularly induced by slow motion landslide phenomena. The {{study has been}} performed on eleven sites in the Liguria Region, chosen as representative of different morphological and stability conditions. For these sites (each one covering an average area of some square Km) data elaborated by the Permanent Scatterers Interferometry SAR technique (PSInSARTM) were available. The images dataset have been acquired by ERS- 1 and ERS- 2 satellites from 1992 to 2001. The technique is based on the analysis of the movements of objects characterized by a stable and point-like behaviour (Permanent Scatterers) for which the average annual velocity is derived. Permanent Scatterers usually correspond to man-made structures such as buildings, steel elements and structures, retaining walls, roads, etc., as well as natural reflectors (e. g. exposed rock). In any case the targets maintain constant their geometrical characteristics (dimension and orientation) with time. The technique is virtually unaffected by temporal and geometrical decorrelation effects. In the selected areas almost 800 targets (on a number of over 1400) have been “materialized”, surveyed and listed; most of them referring to buildings, roads or part of them. All the data useful for the study purpose have been collected, especially as far as target description, geometrical and structural characteristics, construction/retrofit period, average movement velocity, cracks, damage degree, are concerned. By these information a data base has been obtained, useful for statistical analyses. Working over large areas, (even if on every single target) simplified damage criteria has been adopted to point out the average degree of damage to which a particular zone have been subjected to. Analyzing crack patterns and damage characteristics (on structural elements clearly subjected to past and/or current movements) direction on movements has been estimated and, when possible, related to landslide movement information. The obtained “damage maps” allows to identify the accuracy and reliability on the interferometric technique and, also, to localize areas of particular interest as far as landslide risk or new building permission are concerned. To sum up, the main gathered results allow the following: - The performed study has demonstrated the high reliability of the SAR technique, in that a good correlation between obtained velocity and degree of damage has been always verified. - The data need an accurate and critical interpretation, to avoid the simple conclusions “high velocity = high hazard” and “low velocity = no risk”). - The importance of information coming from local monitoring (e. g. inclinometers), from accurate geomorphological analyses, and, especially, from the knowledge of structural characteristics and structure response need to be stressed when passing from “large area scale” to “building scale” analyses. - As expected, masonry structures behave differently from RC structures.

Tetraplegia refers to an SCI in the cervical region of the spinal cord that impacts on the functionality of all four limbs. ‘Complete’ tetraplegia results in complete paralysis of the legs, partial or complete paralysis of the arms and trunk, and in the most severe cases, the neck. The independence of people living with tetraplegia is heavily dependent on assistive and mobility devices. Understanding the strength characteristics of people with tetraplegia is crucially important for the suitable and effective design of mobility and rehabilitative devices such as wheelchairs. A study using a stationary dynamometer and video capture measured kinetic and kinematic characteristics of wheelchair propulsion for 15 subjects with C 5 -C 7 tetraplegia. This study differentiated between subjects with different injuries, at two different test resistances, and was more comprehensive than other reported studies on MWC propulsion. Some of {{the subjects in the}} study with C 5 -C 6 injuries had no elbow extension capability, while others had undergone a deltoids-to-triceps tendon transfer procedure called TROIDS, which restores some elbow extension capability. No differences were found in any of the push phase metrics between those who had undergone the TROIDs procedure, and those who had not, suggesting that TROIDs provides no significant benefit for mobility. As expected, subjects with C 7 tetraplegia <b>recorded</b> <b>velocity</b> and power outputs significantly higher than those for subjects with C 5 -C 6 tetraplegia. To better understand the strength characteristics over the full range of motion in the sagittal plane, and thus potentially modify the design of mobility devices to better suit these characteristics, a novel method for gathering strength data in multiple directions and positions was developed. This method had advantages over other commonly used methods. In particular, it was inclusive of complex muscle and joint interactions that would otherwise be very difficult to build into a model. Sagittal horizontal push strength was measured using this method for 8 able bodied and 4 tetraplegic subjects. There were clear trends in the data from the able-bodied subjects, and a fourth order polynomial (R-squared = 0. 8) was fitted to the data for modelling purposes. Data for the tetraplegic subjects varied significantly from the able-bodied data, but inter-individual variation was such that no model would provide a satisfactory fit to the data indicating a very high degree of patient-specific behaviour. One multi-directional data set, consisting 1584 measurements in the sagittal plane, was gathered for an able-bodied subject. The main trends in this measured data were successfully captured by a model consisting of twelve fourth-order polynomials. Building on these measurements, and employing a human model in the constraint modelling environment, SWORDS, this thesis develops a conceptual design tool for comparing the effectiveness of different hand force paths. Initial simulations using hypothetical hand paths indicated that the proposed method for predicting the direction of the applied force needs to be verified, and likely refined, for hand paths that differ significantly from the traditional wheelchair push-rim path. This proposed procedure {{has the potential to be}} a powerful tool for optimising and modifying the design of wheelchairs or human powered devices to utilise previously untapped abilities for any given population...|$|E

Currently, no metric exists to guide the educational process while surgeons {{are still on the}} learning curve. In this paper, we propose to identify and qualify the patterns of movements recorded from the da Vinci^TM robotic surgical system (Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale CA) that are most consistent with mastery and can define levels of proficiency.

Laboratory experiments are performed inside a flume (0. 8 m× 0. 8 m× 18 m) for various arrangements of pervious and impervious building blocks. The Digital Particle Velocimetry System (DPIV) was used for <b>recording</b> <b>velocity</b> distributions behind the building blocks under three upstream discharge ratios. The relationship between building blockage and flow pattern is determined {{as well as the}} pervious effect for wake flow characteristics behind the blocks.
