40|$|Threats {{posed by}} new, {{emerging}} or <b>re-emerging</b> <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> {{are taking a}} global dimension, to which the World Health Organization (WHO) Secretariat has been responding with determination since 1995. Key to the global strategy for tackling epidemics across borders {{is the concept of}} global public health surveillance, which has been expanded and formalized by WHO and its technical partners through a number of recently developed instruments and initiatives. The adoption by the 58 th World Health Assembly of the revised (2005) International Health Regulations provides the legal framework for mandating countries to link and coordinate their action through a universal network of surveillance networks. While novel environmental threats and outbreak-prone diseases have been increasingly identified during the past three decades, new processes of influence have appeared more recently, driven by the real or perceived threats of bio-terrorism and disruption of the global economy. Accordingly, the global surveillance agenda is being endorsed, and to some extent seized upon by new actors representing security and economic interests. This paper explores external factors influencing political commitment to comply with international health regulations and it illustrates adverse effects generated by: perceived threats to sovereignty, blurred international health agendas, lack of internationally recognized codes of conduct for outbreak investigations, and erosion of the impartiality and independence of international agencies. A companion paper (published in this issue) addresses the intrinsic difficulties that health systems of low-income countries are facing when submitted to the ever-increasing pressure to upgrade their public health surveillance capacity...|$|R

The report contains epidemiological data on 49 <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> (together with healthcare associated infections and antimicrobial resistant infections) {{collected from the}} 25 EU member states, Norway and Iceland for the year 2005. It includes a discussion on the main determinants of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in the EU and their consequences, and suggests {{some of the main}} actions that are needed to deal with <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in the EU. The annual report on the <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> threats monitored in the EU also forms part of the document. The overall incidence of a number of the <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> is low in Europe with several diseases showing clear signs of steadily declining trends (eg measles) or of remaining relatively stable (eg invasive pneumococcal disease) over the past 10 years. Similarly the data show that the incidence of certain gastrointestinal infections (eg campylobacter) and certain STIs (eg HIV, Chlamydia) is increasing overall, highlighting the need to continue national prevention and control programmes.

40|$|Background: In many {{countries}} public and political interest {{exists on the}} <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects of prison crowding, prompting standards on minimum floor area of sleeping accommodation per person. Yet the extent and reliability of the worldwide evidence on the association between prison cell spatial density and <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> is uncertain. Method: We conducted a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature for articles that reported on the association between prison cell spatial density and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects in prisoners. Included studies were assessed for quality. A draft report was peer-reviewed by an independent researcher. Some revisions were made in light of reviewer comments. Findings: 3, 532 articles were identified and 6 were included. Studies were conducted in the US (1980 s), Pakistan (2003) and Nigeria (2012, 2013). <b>Communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects/outcomes included pneumococcal disease/acute pneumonia, mycobacterium tuberculosis, infectious skin conditions, and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> reporting to the prison clinic. There was mostly consistent evidence that cell spatial density is associated with <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases.</b> The associations and statistical precision observed suggest a ‘slight’ <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> impact of cell spatial density on prisoners. However, {{it is possible that}} these associations are due to confounding, bias and/or chance. Conclusion: The evidence provides some support that <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects are associated with cell spatial density but care should be taken in the interpretation of the findings. Socio-cultural demographic and historical differences between study populations examined also restrict the generalisability of findings. Key words: Communicable diseases; Population health planning, demography, needs assessment; Justice and ethics Key messages: 1. 	There is paucity of research examining the association between prison cell crowding (‘spatial density’) and <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> effects 2.

40|$|Background: Although notable {{advances}} in disease prevention have been accomplished, <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> are still important {{at the international}} scale. Many epidemiologic {{studies have been conducted}} about the epidemiology of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> in Iran, but less {{attention has been paid to}} generating an atlas of all disease. Some experts believe that mapping diseases such as malaria is the first step toward establishing early warning systems and managing disease control. In this manuscript, we tried to gather information about the <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> of Iran in a geo-database, and draw maps with high accuracy. Methods: Initially reportable cases of diseases were gathered from the Iranian <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> control center. Then, these data were arranged in a geo-referenced database in the Arc-GIS software and then the related maps were generated. Results: Twenty five maps of <b>communicable</b> <b>diseases</b> were created in 2008. Some diseases like malaria had considerable foci and some other disease according to their condition did not have a considerable dispersion. Conclusion: Although the history of preparing an atlas of diseases goes back to the 19 th century, papers about mapping diseases in Iran are restricted to single diseases or these atlases are not easily accessible. The present article is unique in this regard in Iran. Keywords: Mapping, Geographical Information System (GIS), Epidemiology, <b>Communicable</b> <b>disease,</b> Ira...|$|R

Method: This study is a qualitative study used ethnographic methods. The research location at Sulaho village, Lasusua sub district, North Kolaka regency.

Results: Non <b>communicable</b> <b>disease</b> founded at Sulaho were cases of hypertension, stroke, diseases caused by workplace accidents and iodine defi ciency disorders (IDD).
