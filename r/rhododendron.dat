5|$|Deciduous forests cover 80% of the park's {{area and}} belong to 28 forest and 18 bush habitats. This variety {{is due to}} the lower river valleys, the sea coast and the karstic terrain. These include forests of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), sessile oak (Quercus petraea), Strandzhan oak (Quercus hartwissiana), Hungarian oak (Quercus frainetto), common {{hornbeam}} (Carpinus betulus), oriental hornbeam (Carpinus orientalis) and small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) with undergrowth of pontic <b>rhododendron</b> (<b>Rhododendron</b> ponticum), Caucasian whortleberry (Vaccinium arctostaphylos), cherry laurel (Prunus laurocerasus), Black Sea holly (Ilex colchica), Himalayan meadow primrose (Primula rosea) and common heather (Calluna).|$|E
5|$|Regular ferry {{service on}} the Dalco Passage between Point Defiance in Tacoma and Tahlequah on Vashon Island started with the MV Skansonia in June 1951 during the {{creation}} of the WSF, and served the route until the completion of the MV Hiyu in 1967. The Hiyu operated for 26 years until it was replaced by the refurbished MV <b>Rhododendron</b> in 1993. The Hiyu briefly returned to the route twice, in June 2008 and in September and October 2008, while the <b>Rhododendron</b> was loaned out to Pierce County for the SteilacoomAnderson Island ferry. The , built in 2010, began serving the route in January 2012.|$|E

40|$|Resistance to {{the black}} vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus (F.) in in <b>rhododendrons</b> was {{examined}} {{on the basis of}} leaf type. Indumented (hairy) and lepitode (scaly) <b>rhododendrons</b> were compared to glabrous (clear leaf) <b>rhododendrons</b> for feeding damage and egg production. A screening study of Taxus cultivars for resistance to the weevil was also conducted. Weevil preference for <b>rhododendrons</b> was tested in an open bed by measuring leaf damage and by counting larvae on the roots {{at the end of the}} study. Weevils were also confined on individual plants and leaf damage, frass production, and egg production were measured each week. The preference study showed that indumented and lepitode <b>rhododendrons</b> had less feeding damage than glabrous <b>rhododendrons.</b> However, there were wide differences within groups. The confined study showed that indumented <b>rhododendrons</b> generally had less leaf surf ace removed than the lepidote and glabrous <b>rhododendrons.</b> The frass production results showed few differences by leaf group. The indumented cross R. smirnowii x R. yakusimanum supported the lowest egg production and was significantly different from all <b>rhododendrons</b> tested. The indumented <b>rhododendrons</b> R. smirnowii and R. yakusimanum were significantly different from the glabrous <b>rhododendrons</b> in the number of eggs produced by weevils confined to these hosts. All Taxus varieties had high mortality from feeding by the black vine weevil and no weevil resistance was demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: A {{review of}} {{different}} conservation aspects of <b>rhododendrons</b> from the Sikkim Himalaya is retraced. Works {{done in the}} past and present on the various aspects of the regional <b>rhododendrons</b> vis-Ã -vis national and global research findings are presented and discussed for its contribution and effect {{to the understanding of the}} group. <b>Rhododendrons</b> which are classified as rare, endangered and threatened may be wiped out in near future from the biota, if proper management and conservation initiatives are not taken up. Chronologic primary and derived data on various aspects of regional <b>rhododendrons,</b> viz., species enumeration, species availability and distribution, general usage, identification of anthropogenic pressure, ex situ / in situ and in vitro conservation initiatives, etc. are highlighted. The role of regional <b>rhododendrons</b> as keystone element in the context of Sikkim Himalaya is also presented for a better understanding of conservational issues at upper temperate and lower alpine region of Sikkim...|$|R
50|$|<b>Rhododendrons</b> {{are often}} valued in {{landscaping}} for their structure, size, flowers, {{and the fact}} that many of them are evergreen. Azaleas are frequently used around foundations and occasionally as hedges, and many larger-leafed <b>rhododendrons</b> lend themselves well to more informal plantings and woodland gardens, or as specimen plants. In some areas, larger <b>rhododendrons</b> can be pruned to encourage more tree-like form, with some species such as R. arboreum and R. falconeri eventually growing to 10-15 m or more tall.|$|R
5|$|Much of {{the area}} resembles Pennsylvania in climate, {{vegetation}} and wildlife. The park is near the southern limit for eastern hemlock and eastern white pine. Coves in the area vary by elevation and topography, with second-growth oak and hickory more common in lower-lying areas. The surrounding forests contain rich, high-altitude flora including rare wildflowers and ferns, such as Persistent Trillium, which grows near <b>Rhododendron.</b> Nearby boulderfields by Blood Mountain include Dutchman's breeches, squirrel corn, waterleaf and other herbaceous plants.|$|E
5|$|The local Biodiversity Action Plan {{recommends}} {{land management}} measures {{to control the}} spread of ragwort and bracken and identifies four non-native, invasive species as threatening native biodiversity: Japanese knotweed, <b>rhododendron,</b> New Zealand flatworm and mink. It also identifies problems of over-grazing resulting in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats {{and a loss of}} native woodland, caused by the large numbers of red deer and sheep.|$|E
5|$|The park {{is managed}} by the National Parks Board, and is open daily to the public. Admission is free except for {{entrance}} to the war museum. The park is accessible via entrances on Vigilante Drive and Pepys Road, off Pasir Panjang Road.

5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of <b>Rhododendron</b> ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle is threatened by fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovoltata {{mushrooms}} grow {{in groups}} on the ground. Amanita species form mycorrhizal relationships with trees. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around the roots of trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. The original Japanese collections were made in forests dominated by Japanese beech (Fagus crenata), {{but it has also}} been found growing near Quercus luecotrichophora, <b>Rhododendron</b> arboreum, and Myrica esculenta in India, in Castanopsis-Schima forest in Nepal, and in Castanopsis indica plantations in the Himalayas.|$|E
5|$|Boreal {{forest trees}} such as black spruce, paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook. Plants such as mountain laurel, leather leaf, pitcher plant, <b>rhododendron,</b> huckleberry, and lady's slipper inhabit bogs in these wetlands. Old-growth forests containing oak, pine, and hemlock trees are {{also present in}} the Nay Aug Gorge. Upstream of Ridge Row, the stream's riparian buffer is wooded with some rock outcrops. Upstream of Nay Aug, the riparian canopy is mostly intact. Some hemlock trees in the Nay Aug Gorge {{have been affected by}} hemlock wooly adelgid.|$|E

5|$|Sheep {{follow a}} diurnal pattern of activity, feeding {{from dawn to}} dusk, {{stopping}} sporadically to rest and chew their cud. Ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. Types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. Common plants toxic to sheep are present {{in most of the}} world, and include (but are not limited to) cherry, some oaks and acorns, tomato, yew, rhubarb, potato, and <b>rhododendron.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Pulveroboletus ravenelii grow {{on the ground}} singly, scattered, or in groups in woods under conifers. Preferred {{mycorrhizal}} plant hosts include pine, hemlock, and <b>rhododendron.</b> Fruiting occurs from July to October. In North America, it is distributed from eastern Canada extending south to the Gulf of Mexico, and west to Texas, Michigan, and California. The bolete was reported from a Mexican beech (Fagus mexicana) forest in Hidalgo, Mexico in 2010. It has also been recorded from Costa Rica and Colombia. In Asia, {{it has been found}} in Indonesia and China. It has also been recorded from northeast Australia.|$|E
5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon isoprene units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 isoprene units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 isoprene units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making <b>Rhododendron</b> leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the steep}} {{elevation}} increase around the pass, the vegetation graduates from sub-tropical forest at its base, to a temperate region, to a {{wet and dry}} alpine climate, and finally to cold tundra desert devoid of vegetation. Around Nathu La and the Tibetan side, the region has little vegetation besides scattered shrubs. Major species found in the region include dwarf rhododendrons (<b>Rhododendron</b> anthopogon, R. setosum) and junipers. The meadows include the genera Poa, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Primula, and Aconitum. The region has a four-month growing season during which grasses, sedges, and medicinal herbs grow abundantly and support a host of insects, wild and domestic herbivores, larks, and finches. The nearby Kyongnosla Alpine Sanctuary has rare, endangered ground orchida and rhododendrons interspersed among tall junipers and silver firs.|$|E
5|$|In August, {{plans were}} {{in place for the}} Allied forces {{to break out of the}} ANZAC foothold. Key to this was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade {{commenced}} its assault on Chunuk Bair, the crest of the range, along what was known as <b>Rhododendron</b> Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched in daylight rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Infantry Battalion. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. His refusal to advance in daylight meant that by the end of the day, his battalion was the only intact battalion in the brigade.|$|E
5|$|The Nevill Ground was {{established}} in 1895 after {{the purchase of the}} land by the Tunbridge Wells Cricket, Football and Athletic Club, with assistance from the Bluemantle Cricket Club. It was purchased on a 99-year lease from the Marquess of Abergavenny as the land was part of his Eridge Park estate. The Nevill Ground was named after William Nevill, 1st Marquess of Abergavenny. Building of the ground's facilities started in 1896 with it being officially opened by the Marquess of Abergavenny in 1898. In the early 20th century, the county boundary between Kent and East Sussex ran through the Nevill Ground's pitch. <b>Rhododendron</b> bushes were also planted in the Nevill Ground's early history. The rhododendrons around the pitch are considered by cricket commentators as one of the defining images of the Nevill Ground. The end opposite the pavilion is known as the Railway End due to the Hastings Line running close by that end of the ground.|$|E
