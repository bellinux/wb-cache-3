5|$|Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn is a {{role-playing}} {{video game}} developed by BioWare {{and published by}} Black Isle Studios. It is the sequel to Baldur's Gate (1998) and was released for Microsoft Windows in September 2000. Like Baldur's Gate, the game {{is set in the}} Forgotten Realms campaign setting and is based on the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition <b>rule</b> <b>set.</b> The game, which is powered by BioWare's Infinity Engine, uses an isometric perspective and pausable real-time gameplay. The player controls a party of up to six characters, one of whom is the player-created protagonist; and the others, certain characters from the game world.|$|E

Most of the rules are common to both <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> and the difference is primarily the number of cards in the deck.|$|R
40|$|Access control {{policies}} describe {{high level}} requirements for access control systems. Access control <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> ideally translate these policies {{into a coherent}} and manageable collection of Allow/Deny <b>rules.</b> Designing <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> that reflect desired policies is a difficult and time-consuming task. The result is that <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> are difficult to understand and manage. The goal {{of this paper is}} to provide means for obtaining usable access control <b>rule</b> <b>sets,</b> which we define as <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> that (i) reflect the access control policy and (ii) are easy to understand and manage. In this paper, we formally define the challenges that users face when generating usable access control <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> and provide formal tools to handle them more easily. We started our research with a pilot study in which specialists were interviewed. The objective was to list usability challenges regarding the management of access control <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> and verify how those challenges were handled by specialists. The results of the pilot study were compared and combined with results from related work and refined into six novel, formally defined metrics that are used to measure the security and usability aspects of access control <b>rule</b> <b>sets.</b> We validated our findings with two user studies, which demonstrate that our metrics help users generate statistically significant better <b>rule</b> <b>sets...</b>|$|R

5|$|Pool of Radiance {{is based}} on the same game {{mechanics}} as the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons <b>rule</b> <b>set.</b> As in many role-playing games (RPGs), each player character in Pool of Radiance has a character race and a character class, determined {{at the beginning of the}} game. Six races are offered, including elves and halflings, as well as four classes (fighter, cleric, wizard, and thief). Non-human characters have the option to become multi-classed, which means they gain the capabilities of more than one class, but advance in levels more slowly. During character creation, the computer randomly generates statistics for each character, although the player can alter these attributes. The player also chooses each character's alignment, or moral philosophy; while the player controls each character's actions, alignment can affect how NPCs view their actions. The player can then customize the appearance and colors of each character's combat icon. Alternatively, the player can load a pre-generated party to be used for introductory play. These characters are combined into a party of six or less, with two slots open for NPCs. Players create their own save-game files, assuring character continuation regardless of events in the game. On an MS-DOS computer, the game can be copied to the hard-disk drive. Other computer systems, such as the Commodore 64, require a separate save-game disk.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an application of}} genetic algorithms (GA's) to classify epidemiological data, which is often challenging to classify due to noise and other factors. For such complex data (that requires {{a large number of}} very specific rules to achieve a high accuracy), smaller <b>rule</b> <b>sets,</b> composed of more general rules, may be preferable, even if they are less accurate. The GA presented here allows the user to encourage smaller <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> by setting a parameter. The <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> found are also compared to those created by standard decision-tree algorithms. The results illustrate tradeoffs involving the number of rules, descriptive accuracy, predictive accuracy, and accuracy in describing and predicting positive examples across different <b>rule</b> <b>sets.</b> ...|$|R

It has been conjectured that stable production <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> are determinstic, meaning in particular that they cannot implement arbiters, and that the sequence of values sent on any channel is independent of the execution.

25|$|When a {{programming}} language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained <b>rule</b> <b>set</b> than basic type checking, but this {{comes at a price}} when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. It is challenging to find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E

In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used.

In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Ensembles are {{a set of}} {{classification}} models that, when combined, produce better predictions than when used by themselves. This chapter proposes a new evolutionary algorithm-based method for creating an ensemble of <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> consisting of two stages. First, an evolutionary algorithm (more precisely, a genetic programming algorithm) is used to automatically create complete rule induction algorithms. Secondly, the automatically-evolved rule induction algorithms are used to produce <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> that are then combined into an ensemble. Concerning this second stage, we investigate the effectiveness of two different approaches for combining the votes of all <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> in the ensemble and two different approaches for selecting which subset of evolved rule induction algorithms (out of all evolved algorithms) {{should be used to}} produce the <b>rule</b> <b>sets</b> that will be combined into an ensemble...|$|R

This study examined associations between rule-based parenting practices (limit and collaborative <b>rule</b> <b>setting)</b> and SV in 6 ‚Äì 8 -year old children. MethodsAn online survey of 735 mothers in 2011 assessed: time that children spent engaged in SV activities; and the use of limit and collaborative <b>rule</b> <b>setting.</b> Logistic regression was used to examine the extent to which limit and collaborative <b>rule</b> <b>setting</b> were associated with SV behaviours. Results‚ÄòAlways‚Äô setting limits was associated with more TV viewing, computer, smartphone and game-console use and a positive association was found between ‚Äòalways‚Äô setting limits for game-console use and multi-SV (in girls). Associations were stronger in mothers of girls compared to mothers of boys. ‚ÄòSometimes‚Äô setting limits was associated with more TV viewing. There was no association between ‚Äòsometimes‚Äô setting limits and computer, game-console or smartphone use. There was a negative association between collaborative <b>rule</b> <b>setting</b> and game-console use in boys. ConclusionsLimit setting is associated with greater SV. Collaborative <b>rule</b> <b>setting</b> may be effective for managing boys' game-console use. More research is needed to understand rule-based parenting practices...|$|R
