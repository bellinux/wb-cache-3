40|$|The clean pull is {{a common}} {{exercise}} among athletes. Some athletes use <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> in this exercise, but efficacy of <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> has not been examined. The {{purpose of the present}} study was to examine the effects of <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> on velocity, force and power during the clean pull. Five male professional Rugby Union players performed two sets of two repetitions of the clean pull with a 140 -kg barbell under two conditions: with and without the <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> in a counterbalanced order. An optical encoder was attached to the barbell, and peak velocity of the barbell, and force / power applied to the barbell were obtained through an inverse dynamics approach. The highest value amongst four trials (two sets of two repetitions) in each condition for each subject was used to compare between the two conditions by effect size. Four out of five subjects showed greater peak velocity (10. 1 - 28. 5 %), force (2. 9 - 34. 4 %), and power (6. 5 - 46. 5 %) with the <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> but one subject did not show a difference between conditions. The effect sizes for the velocity, force, and power were 1. 22, 1. 52, and 1. 31, respectively, showing large effects. It is concluded that using <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> is beneficial for athletes who wish to enhance velocity, force and power during clean pull...|$|R

2500|$|On 9 December 1971, {{ownership}} of the boat {{was transferred to the}} Oklahoma Maritime Advisory Board. The towing was divided into two phases.

40|$|Automotive {{aerodynamics}} {{measurements and}} simulations now routinely use a moving ground and rotating wheels (MVG&RW), {{which is more}} representative of on-road conditions than the fixed ground-fixed wheel (FG&FW) alternative. This {{can be understood as}} a combination of three elements: (a) moving ground (MVG), (b) rotating front wheels (RWF) and (c) rotating rear wheels (RWR). The interaction of these elements with the flow field has been explored to date by mainly experimental means. This paper presents a mainly computational (CFD) investigation of the effect of RWF and RWR, in combination with MVG, on the flow field around a saloon vehicle. The influence of MVG&RW is presented both in terms of a combined change from a FG&FW baseline and the incremental effects seen by the addition of each element separately. For this vehicle, noticeable decrease in both drag and <b>rear</b> <b>lift</b> is shown when adding MVG&RW, whereas front lift shows little change. The same trends are seen in both CFD and experimental data. The addition of MVG alone increases both drag and front <b>lift,</b> whereas <b>rear</b> <b>lift</b> decreases significantly. The addition of RWF alone has little effect on the global results (aside from lift), whereas the addition of RWR alone decreases both drag and <b>rear</b> <b>lift</b> significantly. Combining the incremental changes produces values that align well to the MVG&RW case, with the exception of front lift. This shows similar trends to previously published work, both the noticeable drag decrease due to the addition of MVG&RW, and the contributions of the individual components...|$|R

5000|$|Wrist straps: Wrist <b>straps</b> (<b>lifting</b> <b>straps)</b> are {{sometimes}} used {{to assist in}} gripping very heavy weights. Wrist straps {{can be used to}} isolate muscle groups like in [...] "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the deadlift. Some lifters avoid using wrist straps to develop their grip strength, just as some go further by using thick bars. Wrist straps can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than {{they might be able to}} handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.|$|R

40|$|As the United States highway {{infrastructure}} {{is in need}} of rehabilitation due to increasing traffic needs and structural inadequacies, use of precast concrete elements is increasing. Use of precast concrete systems provide various advantages, including minimizing traffic disruption, increasing the quality of the final product, and lowering life-cycle costs. Both the Federal Highway Administration and the Iowa Department of Transportation have recognized the benefits of using precast concrete elements in bridge construction to help reduce the duration of construction projects. This thesis focuses on the laboratory testing of full-depth precast, prestressed concrete deck panels used in the construction of a continuous four-girder, three span bridge over Squaw Creek on 120 th Street in Boone County, Iowa. Various laboratory tests were conducted on a single panel and on two panels connected by a closure pour. These tests ranged from determining physical properties of the panel (compressive strength and prestressing force), to determining the panel 2 ̆ 7 s response in various circumstances (moving with a crane, during field leveling, and under loading). Tests were conducted to determine physical characteristics of a deck panel such as compressive strength and stress in the mild reinforcing due to prestressing. The average compressive strength of the concrete core samples was 7, 600 psi, which exceeded the specified compressive strength of 5, 000 psi. Prestressing strands in one post-tensioning channel were cut to determine the amount of stress in each strand due to prestressing. Of the six bars instrumented, five were found to have a stress lower than that expected from the initial prestressing force. Strains in the mild reinforcing bars were monitored in the laboratory while a panel was lifted with a crane. Two different strap configurations were used to lift the panel; the first configuration used four <b>lifting</b> <b>straps,</b> and the second used two <b>lifting</b> <b>straps.</b> Results from these tests showed the strap configuration did not {{have a significant effect on}} the strain induced in the mild reinforcing bars. The total strain (measured plus induced due to prestressing) of a bar used during these tests had a maximum value of 70...|$|R
5000|$|In {{order to}} prevent the bar from rolling out of the hands, some lifters {{have been known to}} use an Olympic weightlifting {{technique}} known as the hook grip. This is similar to an overhand grip, but the thumbs are inside, allowing the lifter to [...] "hook" [...] onto them with the fingers. The hook grip can make it easier to hold heavier weights using less grip strength, and keeps both shoulders and elbows in a symmetrical position. While it theoretically takes much of the stress off of the joints which might be created by the twisting of a mixed grip it has the disadvantage of being extremely uncomfortable for the thumbs, something which those who advocate it says will pass once a lifter becomes accustomed to it. Another, but rarely used method is a combination of the mixed overhand-underhand grip and the hook grip, preferred by people who lift heavier weights than their grip can handle, but who don't want to rely on <b>lifting</b> <b>straps</b> or other supportive gear.|$|R

50|$|The lift tow is {{the most}} common modern method for short {{distance}} transportation. The casualty is winched onto a lifting grid and then raised by lifting the grid, with the casualty’s tires strapped to the grid. The grid is shaped like a large pair of spectacles, which accounts for the common name of this type of vehicle, the speclift or spectacle lift. With commercial vehicles, it is more common to use a set of lifting forks to attach to the suspension, axle or chassis of the casualty. In many cases, e.g., with automatics, it is the 'driven' wheels that need to be lifted. This will sometimes result in a <b>rear</b> <b>lift,</b> if the driven wheels are at the rear. In this case the casualty's steering must be locked in the straight ahead position.|$|R

In secret, at Spandau in Germany, Coandă successfully tested a flying machine equipped with a single tractor propeller, and two counter-rotating propellers providing lift, powered by a 50-horsepower (37kW) Antoinette engine. Positioned along the fuselage centreline, the smaller <b>rear</b> <b>lift</b> propeller was mounted vertically, while the larger front one was inclined slightly forwards at 17degrees. According to later claims, Coandă tested the aircraft at Cassel, witnessed by the Chancellor of the German Empire Bernhard von Bülow.
