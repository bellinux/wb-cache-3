40|$|Current anticholinesterase {{pesticides}} {{were developed}} during World War II and are toxic to mammals because they target a catalytic serine residue of acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) in insects and in mammals. A sequence analysis of AChEs from 73 species and a three-dimensional {{model of a}} malaria-carrying mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) AChE (AgAChE) reported here show that C 286 and R 339 of AgAChE are conserved {{at the opening of}} the active site of AChEs in 17 invertebrate and four insect species, respectively. Both residues are absent in the active site of AChEs of human, monkey, dog, cat, cattle, rabbit, rat, and mouse. The 17 invertebrates include house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, German cockroach, Florida lancelet, <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> African bollworm, beet armyworm, codling moth, diamondback moth, domestic silkworm, honey bee, oat or wheat aphid, the greenbug, melon or cotton aphid, green peach aphid, and English grain aphid. The four insects are house mosquito, Japanese encephalitis mosquito, African malaria mosquito, and German cockroach. The discovery of the two invertebrate-specific residues enables the development of effective and safer pesticides that target the residues present only in mosquito AChEs rather than the ubiquitous serine residue, thus potentially offering an effective control of mosquito-borne malaria. Anti-AgAChE pesticides can be designed to interact with R 339 and subsequently covalently bond to C 286. Such pesticides would be toxic to mosquitoes but not to mammals...|$|E
40|$|This is a {{study of}} the {{relationship}} between the occurrence of rice stem borer (Chilo simplex Butler), paddy borer (Schoenobius incertellus Walker), planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens Stal, and Sogata furcifera Horvath), and <b>rice</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> (Lema oryzae Kuwayama), and climatic variations, using statistics on rice crop damage in each of the Japanese prefectures. Data on pest abundance and climatic factors are considered from district to district within each prefecture, as well as from one to another larger area of the country as a whole. The relatinoship discovered is indicated in the following table: Species Climatic condition in district of abundance (1) Chilo simplex June mean temp. : 24 〜 26 ℃ June precip. : 150 〜 250 mm (2) Schoenobius incertellus Jan. mean temp. : > 5 ℃ (3) Nilaparvata lugens and Sogata furcifera Annual temp. : > 15 ℃ (4) Lema oryzae June mean temp. : 18 〜 22 ℃ Annual temp. : > 6 ℃ A map (Fig. 1) shows which areas have the climatic conditions listed in the above table. Based on this, a second map (Fig. 2) is given showing theoretically what should be the percentage of rice crop loss, considering the abundance of each of the four pests in each area. The correlation coefficient (r) between this theoretical estimate and actual statistics is 0. 75 for southern Honshu (Tokai, Kinki, and Chugoku areas) and 0. 59 for the entire country. 害虫の発生量ないし被害程度に関する地理的区分が, 気象要素によって想定し得るか否かを, ニカメイガ・サンカメイガ・ウンカ類・イネドロオイムシについて検討した。まず農林省の統計資料その他によって, これら害虫の多発地の分布実態を調査し, またそれらの地方が如何なる気象要素について相似的であるかを究明した。その結果, 多発地の環境指標として最も適当と思われる気象条件が各種について選出されたが, それらは何れも気温条件を中軸とするものであつた(ニカメイガのみは降水量も加味された) 。これらの条件に当てはまる地域が, 多発地として期待されるものと仮定するならば, これら気象条件の配置から推して, 各種について推定多発地を指示することが出来る(第 1 図) 。またそれらの組合せから, 各種の発生状況ひいては合計の被害程度も或程度は推測拭来るわけである(第 2 図) 。このようなねらいで, 計算作図を行った結果をここに要示したが, 前者(第 1 図) は実際の場合にかなりよく符合し, 後者(第 2 図) においてもかなりの程度に適合することを認めた。本研究は方法その他で不備の点も多く, 細部については更に検討すべき所が多いが, 以上を通覧してこのような方法で多発区を想定することは, 相当利用性があるものと考える。なおこれは, 1 県内部の小地域の区分設定にも適用され得ると考えたい...|$|E

40|$|<b>Leaf</b> <b>beetles</b> (Chrysomelidae) {{are one of}} {{the most}} diverse {{families}} of herbivorous insects. Many of them are important agricultural pests and cause remarkable loss of crop and money as well. Plant leaves and roots are primary food source of both larva and adults of <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Plants produce many secondary metabolites in reaction to herbivore insects. It is a well-known phenomenon that quantity and variety of secondary metabolites in plant leaves may change in response to insect attacks. Herbivore insects have to deal with such defensive secondary chemicals and overcome either by detoxifying or storing them. Accordingly, many specialist herbivores coevolved with their host plant. Certain phenolic glycosides may reduce <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> feeding. Condensed tannins are anti-herbivore defenses against <b>leaf</b> chewing <b>beetles,</b> including <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Flavonoid compounds are feeding deterrents for many flea <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Cinnamic acid derivatives are other known feeding deterrents for <b>leaf</b> <b>beetles.</b> Secondary metabolites quantity and nutritional quality of host plants are not only important for feeding but also for providing enemy-free space and suitable oviposition sites. </p...|$|R

40|$|Cross-resistance, and {{longevity}} of resistance, {{induced by the}} bean <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle,</b> Cerotoma trifurcata, was studied IN the soybean PI 227687 that exhibited induced response in earlier studies. Bean <b>leaf</b> <b>beetle</b> adults and soybean looper, Pseudoplusia includens, larvae were used to induce resistance and to determine beetle feeding preference. Beetles were collected from soybean fields 2 to 5 days prior to the feeding preference test.
