40|$|For {{bouncing}} cosmologies, a fine {{set of parameters}} {{is introduced}} in order to describe the nearly matter dominated phase, and which play the same role that the usual slow-roll parameters play in inflationary cosmology. It is shown that, as in the inflation case, the spectral index and the <b>running</b> <b>parameter</b> for scalar perturbations in bouncing cosmologies can be best {{expressed in terms of}} these small parameters. Further, they explicitly exhibit the duality which exists between a nearly matter dominated Universe in its contracting phase and the quasi de Sitter regime in the expanding one. The results obtained also confirm and extend the known evidence that the spectral index for a matter dominated Universe in the contracting phase is, in fact, the same as the spectral index for an exact Sitter regime in the expanding phase. Finally, in both the inflationary and the matter bounce scenarios, the theoretical values of the spectral index and of the <b>running</b> <b>parameter</b> are compared with their experimental counterparts, obtained from the most recent PLANCK data, with the result that the bouncing models here discussed do fit well accurate astronomical observations.

On the other hand,maximally extended de Sitter metric in the comoving coordinates accords with a special FLRW model with positive spatial curvature,so {{in this article we}} focus on the positively curved inflationary paradigm.

Then,by taking into account the curvature factor,we investigate the relative amplitude of the scalar and tensor perturbations.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} {{topology}} of the Megaparsec Cosmic Web {{on the basis}} of the Alpha Shapes of the galaxy distribution. The simplicial complexes of the alpha shapes are used to determine the set of Betti numbers (k; k = 1; : : :;D), which represent a complete characterization of the topology of a manifold. This forms a useful extension of the geometry and topology of the galaxy distribution by Minkowski functionals, of which three specify the geometrical structure of surfaces and one, the Euler characteristic, represents a key aspect of its topology. In order to develop an intuitive understanding for the relation between Betti numbers and the <b>running</b> <b>parameter</b> of the alpha shapes, and thus in how far they may discriminate between different topologies, we study them within the context of simple heuristic Voronoi clustering models.

In the present paper, it is shown that the parametric representation has a singularity at t→ 0; for this reason, similar results can be obtained for real values of g_ 0. The problem of the correct transition to the strong coupling regime is simultaneously solved; in particular, the constancy of the bare or renormalized mass is not a correct condition of this transition.

For the the special case of large values of <b>running</b> <b>parameter</b> of HL gravity ω, in a positively curved universe k> 0, the domination of the quintessence and phantom matter fields with barotropic equation of state parameter β - 1 / 3 are needed to be the dominant fields of the universe.

Finally, an inequality including the cosmological parameters of the Einstein static universe is obtained for the stability against the tensor perturbations.
