5|$|In that article, he {{attempted}} to show how mental representations, specifically sentences {{in the language of}} thought, are necessary to explain this <b>relational</b> <b>nature</b> of mental states. Fodor considers two alternative hypotheses. The first completely denies the relational character of mental states and the second considers mental states as two-place relations. The latter position can be further subdivided into the Carnapian view that such relations are between individuals and sentences of natural languages and the Fregean view that they are between individuals and the propositions expressed by such sentences.|$|E
25|$|Put otherwise, {{mainstream}} theories rarely, if at all, {{acknowledge that}} it is through relationships, via Dasein's inescapable <b>relational</b> <b>nature,</b> that symptoms and client needs emerge, therefore inadvertently limiting their ability to explain the emergence of said symptoms and needs {{in the life of}} the client. Furthermore, this causes psychotherapy to perpetuate the paradigm that human beings are highly autonomous individuals responding primarily to cognitive reason, taking them out of their relational contexts in the world and limiting human beings to find healing purely from within. Ontological hermeneutics theory states that this kind of relational de-contextualizing actually leads to a form of individualism that is inauthentic and can also result in interpersonal problems that cause human suffering because the individual is ultimately collapsing into an empty self.|$|E

[...] Instead, as the being who is most affected by the world, God is the being who can most appropriately respond to the world.

Jim Fleckenstein, director of the Institute for 21st-Century Relationships, is quoted as stating that the polyamory movement has been driven not only by science fiction, but also by feminism: [...] "Increased financial independence means that women can build relationships {{the way they want}} to." [...] The disillusionment with monogamy is said to be [...] "because of widespread cheating and divorce". The longing for community is associated with a felt need for the richness of [...] "complex and deep relationships through extended networks" [...] in response to the replacement and fragmentation of the extended family by nuclear families. [...] "For many", Echlin writes, [...] "it is a hankering for community... we have become increasingly alienated, partly because of the 20th century's replacement of the extended family with the nuclear family. As a result, many of us are striving to create complex and deep relationships through extended networks of multiple lovers and extended families... Polys agree that some people are monogamous by nature. But some of us are not, and more and more are refusing to be shoehorned into monogamy." ...|$|E

It also sought to ascertain whether employees seek psychological contracts that are transactional or <b>relational</b> in <b>nature</b> or both, as a result of modern day expectations. Research was conducted through interviews and analysis of personnel records and archives for eight people who left the firm in the last three years. The findings suggest that employees seek psychological contracts that are mainly <b>relational</b> in <b>nature.</b> They also suggested that employees become disengaged when particular hygiene and motivator factors fail, either independently, or more usually when combined. The results also suggest that employees are motivated by certain hygiene factors which Herzberg had previously stated could only prevent dissatisfaction but which could not motivate. This suggests that perhaps it is time to rethink Herzberg’s Two-Factor Model of Motivation and consider if some factors which were previously categorised as “Hygiene” should now be considered “Motivator”...|$|R

We apply the relational Markov network framework of Taskar et al. to define a joint probabilistic model over the entire link graph — entity attributes and links. The application of the RMN algorithm to this task requires the definition of probabilistic patterns over subgraph structures. We apply this method to two new relational datasets, one involving university webpages, and the other a social network. We show that the collective classification approach of RMNs, and the introduction of subgraph patterns over link labels, provide significant improvements in accuracy over flat classification, which attempts to predict each link in isolation. ...|$|R

This is done by seamlessly integrating the relational information and the input attributes into the kernel learning process. Through extensive experiments on realworld applications, we demonstrate that our LWP model can give very promising performance in practice. ...|$|R
