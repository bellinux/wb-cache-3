50|$|The <b>Round</b> <b>House,</b> {{the oldest}} {{remaining}} intact building in Western Australia, was {{built as a}} gaol between 1830 and 1831. The <b>Round</b> <b>House</b> had eight cells and a gaoler's residence, which all opened up into a central courtyard. In the 1800s, bay whaling was carried out from Bathers Beach below the <b>Round</b> <b>House.</b> As part of the whaling operations, a tunnel was constructed under the <b>Round</b> <b>House</b> to provide whalers {{with access to the}} town from the jetty and beach. The <b>Round</b> <b>House</b> is located in what is now known as Fremantle's West End: a collection of streets characterised by late Victorian and Edwardian architecture. A process of gentrification in the early 1990s was accelerated by the establishment of the University of Notre Dame Australia that occupies, and has restored, many of the buildings in the West End.|$|R
