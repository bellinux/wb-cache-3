40|$|Abstract. Dynamo {{saturation}} {{is often}} invoked when calculating the rotational evolution of cool stars. At rapid <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> a saturated dynamo reduces the angular momentum {{carried away by}} the stellar wind. This, in turn, may explain the high <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> present {{in the distribution of}} rotation periods in young clusters. Here we point out that concentration of magnetic flux near the poles of rapidly rotating cool stars provides an alternative to dynamo saturation. A high-latitude concentration of field on rapid rotators saturates the angular momentum loss induced by the stellar wind, due to the reduced torque arm. We show that the inclusion of this effect in model calculations is able to reproduce the observed high <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> without the need for dynamo saturation. Taken together with the results of O’Dell et al. (1995) this argues against dynamo saturation at low <b>rotation</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R
40|$|Solar-cycle related {{variation}} of differential rotation is investigated through analyzing the <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> of magnetic fields, distributed along latitudes and varying with {{time at the}} time interval of August 1976 to April 2008. More pronounced differentiation of <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> is found to appear at the ascending part of a Schwabe cycle than at the descending part on an average. The coefficient $B$ in the standard form of differential rotation, which represents the latitudinal gradient of rotation, may be divided into three parts within a Schwabe cycle. Part one spans from the start to the $ 4 ^{th}$ year of a Schwabe cycle, within which the absolute $B$ is approximately a constant or slightly fluctuates. Part two spans from the $ 4 ^{th}$ to the $ 7 ^{th}$ year, within which the absolute $B$ decreases. Part three spans from the $ 7 ^{th}$ year to the end, within which the absolute $B$ increases. Strong magnetic fields repress differentiation of <b>rotation</b> <b>rates,</b> so that <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> show less pronounced differentiation, but weak magnetic fields seem to just reflect differentiation of <b>rotation</b> <b>rates.</b> The solar-cycle related {{variation of}} solar differential rotation is inferred to the result of both the latitudinal migration of the surface torsional pattern and the repression of strong magnetic activity to differentiation of <b>rotation</b> <b>rates.</b> Comment: 19 pages, 8 figures, accepted by MNRAS. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1305. 397...|$|R

5|$|If a star {{displays}} magnetic {{surface activity}} such as starspots, then these features can be tracked {{to estimate the}} <b>rotation</b> <b>rate.</b> However, such features can form at locations other than equator and can migrate across latitudes {{over the course of}} their life span, so differential rotation of a star can produce varying measurements. Stellar magnetic activity is often associated with rapid rotation, so this technique can be used for measurement of such stars. Observation of starspots has shown that these features can actually vary the <b>rotation</b> <b>rate</b> of a star, as the magnetic fields modify the flow of gases in the star.|$|E

40|$|Lagrangian {{statistics}} of passive tracers in rotating turbulence is investigated by particle tracking velocimetry. A confined and steadily forced turbulent flow {{is subjected to}} five different <b>rotation</b> <b>rates.</b> The PDFs of the velocity components clearly reveal the anisotropy induced by background rotation. Although the statistical properties of the horizontal turbulent flow field are approximately isotropic, in agreement with previously reported results by van Bokhoven and coworkers [Phys. Fluids 21 096601 (2009) ], the velocity component parallel to the (vertical) rotation axis gets strongly reduced (compared to the horizontal ones) while the rotation is increased. The auto-correlation coefficients of all three components are progressively enhanced for increasing <b>rotation</b> <b>rates,</b> although the vertical one shows a tendency to decrease for slow <b>rotation</b> <b>rates.</b> The decorrelation is approximately exponential. Lagrangian data compare favorably with previously reported Eulerian data for horizontal velocity components but show a different behavior for the vertical velocity components at higher <b>rotation</b> <b>rates...</b>|$|R

40|$|We present {{solutions}} for the accretion disks and boundary layers in pre-main-sequence stars undergoing FU Orionis outbursts. These solutions differ from earlier disk solutions in that they include a self-consistent treatment of the boundary layer region. In a previous paper (Popham 1996), we showed that these stars should stop accreting angular momentum once they spin up to modest <b>rotation</b> <b>rates.</b> Here we show that for reasonable values of α, these low angular momentum accretion rate solutions fit the spectra and line profiles observed in FU Orionis objects better than solutions with high rates of angular momentum accretion. We find solutions which fit the observations of FU Orionis and V 1057 Cygni. These solutions have mass accretion rates of 2 and 1 × 10 − 4 M ⊙ yr − 1, stellar masses of 0. 7 and 0. 5 M⊙, and stellar radii of 5. 75 and 5. 03 R⊙, respectively. They also have modest stellar <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> 8 − 9 × 10 − 6 s − 1, comparable to the observed <b>rotation</b> <b>rates</b> of T Tauri stars, and angular momentum accretion rates of zero.

The low abundance of heavy elements in the chromosphere of Epsilon Eridani usually indicates an older star, because the interstellar medium (out of which stars form) is steadily enriched by heavier elements produced by older generations of stars. This anomaly might be caused by a diffusion process that has transported some of the heavier elements out of the photosphere and into a region below Epsilon Eridani's convection zone.|$|E
