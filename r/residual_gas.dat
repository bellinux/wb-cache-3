5|$|Only the 120-minute {{tissue is}} used for {{calculation}} of residual nitrogen for repetitive dives. Letter groups are used to indicate the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> content of the 120-minute tissue. Letter groups are modified according to surface interval. A residual nitrogen time is found from the repetitive group and the repetitive dive depth {{which is to be}} added to the planned bottom time.|$|E
5|$|Gaseous {{diffusion}} {{is based}} on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> is slightly depleted. A container wherein the enrichment process takes place through gaseous diffusion is called a diffuser.|$|E
5|$|Since divers on {{the surface}} after a dive still have excess inert gas in their bodies, any {{subsequent}} dive before this excess is fully eliminated needs to modify the schedule {{to take account of}} the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> load from the previous dive. This will result in a shorter available time under water or an increased decompression time during the subsequent dive. The total elimination of excess gas may take many hours, and tables will indicate the time at normal pressures that is required, which may be up to 18 hours.|$|E
40|$|Performed {{experiments}} {{showed that}} silver clusters prepared by different technique, {{such as the}} thermal evaporation in vacuum and the gas aggregation method, had similar spectra of the light emission. The integral intensity of the light emission decreases as pressure of the <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> increases. This change is reversible. The spectrum shape remains invariable; however, spectral lines of excitation of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> arise in the spectrum...|$|R
30|$|To {{reduce the}} heat load from the <b>residual</b> <b>gases,</b> the vacuum {{pressure}} should be below 2  *  10 − 4  Pa.|$|R
40|$|The amounts and {{composition}} of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> formed in sealed ampoules loaded with different sources (elements and II-VI and IV-VI compounds) after consecutive annealings were investigated. A given source was subjected {{to a series of}} heat treatments, with intermediate measurements and removal of the gas accumulated in the system. The results of these experiments are discussed in terms of the underlying thermochemical and kinetic phenomena and practical limitations of reducing the amount of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> in sealed ampoules...|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> is somewhat depleted. The idea was that such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
5|$|A {{personal}} dive {{computer is}} a small computer designed to be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. The dive computer keeps track of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> loading for each tissue used in the algorithm. Dive computers also provide a measure of safety for divers who accidentally dive a different profile to that originally planned. Most dive computers will provide the necessary decompression information for acceptably safe ascent {{in the event that}} the no-decompression limits are exceeded. The use of computers to manage recreational dive decompression is becoming the standard and their use is also common in occupational scientific diving. Their value in surface supplied commercial diving is more restricted, but they can usefully serve as a dive profile recorder.|$|E
5000|$|The {{thickness}} of the film will vary due to the geometry of the evaporation chamber. Collisions with <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> aggravate nonuniformity of thickness.|$|R
30|$|Even {{in extreme}} places, {{considered}} natural, {{it is possible}} to trace human actions: inorganic wastes and <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> produced by human activity can be found even in Antarctica or on Everest.|$|R
40|$|A {{quadrupole}} {{mass filter}} {{was applied to}} laser ablation mass spectrometry, and its analytical performance was investigated. A quadrupole mass filter was set at 45 ° to the sample surface and electron impact ionization method was used. The experimental {{results showed that the}} ion signals of the sample species ablated by laser irradiation show pulse-like profiles, and those of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> in a sample chamber are continuous signals. By detecting the pulsed ion signals generated at laser shots, mass spectra of the samples were obtained without being affected by <b>residual</b> <b>gases.</b> It was shown that the present laser ablation mass spectrometry system is more advantageous in terms of analytical sensitivity than laser ionization mass spectrometry...|$|R
5|$|Exposure {{to reduced}} {{atmospheric}} pressure {{during the period}} after a dive when the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> levels have not yet stabilized at atmospheric saturation levels can incur a risk of decompression sickness. Rules for safe ascent are based on extension of the decompression model calculations to the desired altitude, but are generally simplified to a few fixed periods {{for a range of}} exposures. For the extreme case of an exceptional exposure dive, the US Navy requires a surface interval of 48 hours before ascent to altitude. A surface interval of 24 hours for a Heliox decompression dive and 12 hours for Heliox no-decompression dive are also specified. More detailed surface interval requirements based on the highest repetitive group designator obtained in the preceding 24‑hour period are given on the US Navy Diving Manual Table 9.6, both for ascents to specified altitudes, and for commercial flights in aircraft nominally pressurized to 8000ft.|$|E
25|$|A {{considerable}} amount of inert gas {{will remain in the}} tissues after a diver has surfaced, even if no symptoms of decompression sickness occur. This <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> may be dissolved or in sub-clinical bubble form, and will continue to outgas while the diver remains at the surface. If a repetitive dive is made, the tissues are preloaded with this <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> which will make them saturate faster.|$|E
25|$|The {{benefit of}} such a system is that the helium {{delivery}} tank pressure need not {{be as high as}} that used in the partial pressure method of blending and <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> can be 'topped up' to best mix after the dive. This is important mainly because of the high cost of helium.|$|E
5000|$|High vacuum is vacuum {{where the}} MFP of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> {{is longer than}} {{the size of the}} chamber or of the object under test. High vacuum usually {{requires}} multi-stage pumping and ion gauge measurement. Some texts differentiate between high vacuum and very high vacuum.|$|R
30|$|The {{variation}} of surface chemistry of Ag-covered L-CVD SnO 2 nanolayers {{before and after}} registration of TDS spectra observed by XPS was in a good correlation with the desorption of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> like H 2, H 2 O, O 2, and CO 2 from these nanolayers observed in TDS experiments.|$|R
30|$|After TPD process, SnO 2 {{nanowires}} {{become almost}} stoichiometric without any surface carbon contamination, probably {{thanks to the}} fact that carbon contaminations, as well as <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> from the air, are weakly bounded to the crystalline SnO 2 nanowires and can be easily removed from their surface i.e., by thermal treatments.|$|R
25|$|The <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> {{from the}} Claus process is {{commonly}} called tail gas and that gas is then processed in a tail gas treating unit (TGTU) {{to recover and}} recycle residual sulfur-containing compounds back into the Claus unit. Again, {{as shown in the}} flow diagram, {{there are a number of}} processes available for treating the Claus unit tail gas and for that purpose a WSA process is also very suitable since it can work autothermally on tail gases.|$|E
25|$|As only 30 to 40 {{per cent}} of the gas in the cloud core forms stars, the process of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> {{expulsion}} is highly damaging to the star formation process. All clusters thus suffer significant infant weight loss, while a large fraction undergo infant mortality. At this point, {{the formation of an}} open cluster will depend on whether the newly formed stars are gravitationally bound to each other; otherwise an unbound stellar association will result. Even when a cluster such as the Pleiades does form, it may only hold on to a third of the original stars, with the remainder becoming unbound once the gas is expelled. The young stars so released from their natal cluster become part of the Galactic field population.|$|E
25|$|This {{does not}} mean that all the {{remaining}} gas is unobtainable from a cylinder; rather that the regulator will deliver some of it less efficiently than the designed work of breathing, and the rest only when the ambient pressure is reduced. In most regulator designs the diver will have to overcome a larger cracking pressure to open the demand valve, and flow rate will be reduced. These effects increase as the interstage pressure decreases. This can provide the diver with a warning that gas supply from that cylinder will immanently cease. However, in at least one regulator design, once the interstage pressure has been sufficiently reduced, the inflatable second stage servo-valve will deflate and effectively lock open the demand valve, allowing the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> to escape until the cylinder pressure has dropped to approximately equal the ambient pressure, at which point flow will stop until the ambient pressure is reduced by ascending to shallower depth.|$|E
40|$|The {{combination}} of EUV and <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> cause reflection losses of the mirrors used in future lithography setups. This results in very high costs. The basic {{goal of the}} experiments with the water droplet source built at Philips Research {{was to determine whether}} the source is suitable for contamination experiments...|$|R

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{composition}} of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> formed in sealed ampoules loaded with different elements or binary II-VI or IV-VI compounds and subjected to various thermal processings, annealing and/or resublimation conducted under different conditions were investigated.

25|$|Thomson {{constructed}} a Crookes tube {{with a better}} vacuum. At {{the start of the}} tube was the cathode from which the rays projected. The rays were sharpened to a beam by two metal slits – the first of these slits doubled as the anode, the second was connected to the earth. The beam then passed between two parallel aluminium plates, which produced an electric field between them when they were connected to a battery. The end of the tube was a large sphere where the beam would impact on the glass, created a glowing patch. Thomson pasted a scale to the surface of this sphere to measure the deflection of the beam. Note that any electron beam would collide with some <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> atoms within the Crookes tube, thereby ionizing them and producing electrons and ions in the tube (space charge); in previous experiments this space charge electrically screened the externally applied electric field. However, in Thomson's Crookes tube the density of residual atoms was so low that the space charge from the electrons and ions was insufficient to electrically screen the externally applied electric field, which permitted Thomson to successfully observe electrical deflection.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} of the MAUD Committee at Oxford was led by Simon. As a German émigré, he was only able to get involved because of Peierls, who pointed out that Simon had already begun research on isotope separation, so the project would get a head start by his participation. The Oxford team was composed mostly non-British scientists, including Nicholas Kurti, Kurt Mendelssohn, Heinrich Kuhn, Henry Shull Arms and Heinz London. They concentrated on isotope separation with a method known as gaseous diffusion. Gaseous diffusion is based on Graham's law, which states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas through a porous barrier is inversely proportional to the square root of the gas's molecular mass. In a container with a porous barrier containing a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is slightly enriched in the lighter molecules, while the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> is slightly depleted. Simon's team conducted experiments with copper gauze as the barrier. Because uranium hexafluoride, the only known gas containing uranium, was both scarce and difficult to handle, a mixture of carbon dioxide and water vapour was used to test it.|$|E
500|$|For {{planning}} and monitoring of inert gas absorption using decompression tables, the data usually {{consists of the}} maximum depth reached during the dive, the bottom time {{as defined by the}} dive table in use and the length of time underwater (total dive time). [...] For repetitive dives it also includes the [...] "surface interval" [...] – the time spent above the water between the previous dive and the start of the next dive. [...] This information is used to estimate the levels of residual inert gas build-up in the diver's tissues during and after completing a dive or series of dives. <b>Residual</b> <b>gas</b> is often expressed as [...] "repetitive group", which is an important input value for planning the decompression for the next dive when using tables. A more detailed and extensive set of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> data is stored in the memory of a dive computer, and automatically applied as initial conditions to subsequent dives.|$|E
40|$|A corona {{vacuum test}} {{facility}} for nondestructive testing of power system components {{was built in}} the Reliability and Quality Engineering Test Laboratories at the NASA Lewis Research Center.

30|$|The main factors {{responsible}} for the dependence of the grain size and surface roughness on the deposition rate are {{the features of the}} island growth mode (surface diffusion of adatoms, nucleation, and coalescence of Al clusters) and the influence of the <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> (in particular oxygen), which can be incorporated into the film during deposition [26].|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} under which ordinary chondrites containing iron in three different chemical states can form in thermodynamic equilibrium with a gas phase are calculated. Hydrogen depletion factors of 100 - 1000 are obtained {{and the formation of}} liquid condensates from <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> occurs at pressures (prior to hydrogen depletion) of roughly equal to or greater than 1 atm...|$|R
500|$|One {{unresolved}} {{issue with}} {{this model is}} that it cannot explain how the initial orbits of the proto-terrestrial planets, which would have needed to be highly eccentric to collide, produced the remarkably stable and nearly circular orbits they have today. One hypothesis for this [...] "eccentricity dumping" [...] is that the terrestrials formed in a disc of gas still not expelled by the Sun. The [...] "gravitational drag" [...] of this <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> would have eventually lowered the planets' energy, smoothing out their orbits. However, such gas, if it existed, would have prevented the terrestrial planets' orbits from becoming so eccentric in the first place. Another hypothesis is that gravitational drag occurred not between the planets and <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> but between the planets and the remaining small bodies. As the large bodies moved through the crowd of smaller objects, the smaller objects, attracted by the larger planets' gravity, formed a region of higher density, a [...] "gravitational wake", in the larger objects' path. As they did so, the increased gravity of the wake slowed the larger objects down into more regular orbits.|$|E
500|$|For {{the planned}} {{depth of the}} {{repetitive}} dive, a bottom time can be calculated using the relevant algorithm which will provide an equivalent gas loading to the <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> after the surface interval. This is called [...] "residual nitrogen time" [...] (RNT) when the gas is nitrogen. The RNT {{is added to the}} planned [...] "actual bottom time" [...] (ABT) to give an equivalent [...] "total bottom time" [...] (TBT) which is used to derive the appropriate decompression schedule for the planned dive.|$|E
500|$|The {{personal}} decompression computer, or dive computer, {{is a small}} computer {{designed to}} be worn by a diver during a dive, with a pressure sensor and an electronic timer mounted in a waterproof and pressure resistant housing and which has been programmed to model the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues in real time during a dive. Most are wrist mounted, but a few are mounted in a console with the submersible pressure gauge and possibly other instruments. A display allows the diver to see critical data during the dive, including the maximum and current depth, duration of the dive, and decompression data including the remaining no decompression limit calculated in real time for the diver throughout the dive. Other data such as water temperature and cylinder pressure are also sometimes displayed. The dive computer has the advantages of monitoring the actual dive, {{as opposed to the}} planned dive, and does not assume on a [...] "square profile" [...] – it dynamically calculates the real profile of pressure exposure in real time, and keeps track of <b>residual</b> <b>gas</b> loading for each tissue used in the algorithm.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{abundant}} resources available on Mars is the atmosphere. The primary constituent, carbon dioxide, {{can be used to}} produce a wide variety of consumables including propellants and breathing air. The <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> can be used for additional pressurization tasks including supplementing the oxygen partial pressure in human habitats. A system is presented that supplies pure, high-pressure carbon dioxide and a separate stream of <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> ready for further processing. This power-efficient method freezes the carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere using a pulse-tube cryocooler. The resulting CO 2 mass is later thawed in a closed pressure vessel, resulting in a compact source of liquefied gas at the vapor pressure of the bulk fluid. Results from a demonstration system are presented along with analysis and system scaling factors for implementation at larger scales. Trace gases in the Martian atmosphere challenge the system designer for all carbon dioxide acquisitions concepts. The approximately five percent of other gases build up as local concentrations of CO 2 are removed, resulting in diminished performance of the collection process. The presented system takes advantage of this fact and draws the concentrated <b>residual</b> <b>gases</b> away as a useful byproduct. The presented system represents an excelient volume and mass solution for collecting and compressing this valuable Martian resource. Recent advances in pulse-tube cryocooler technology have enabled this concept to be realized in a reliable, low power implementation...|$|R
