40|$|The {{relationship}} between volume and volatility has received much {{attention in the}} literature on financial markets. However, {{due to the lack of}} data, few results have been presented for the foreign exchange (FX) market. Furthermore, most studies contain only aggregate series, and cannot distinguish between the impact of different participants or instruments. We study the impact of volume on volatility in the FX market using a unique data set of daily trading in the Swedish krona (SEK) market. The data set covers 95 percent of worldwide SEK trading, and is disaggregated on a number of reporting banks' buying and selling in five different instruments on a daily basis from 1995 until 2002. We find that volume in general show a positive correlation with volatility. However, the strength of the relationship depends on the instrument traded and the identity of the <b>reporting</b> <b>bank.</b> In particular, we find that trading tends to concentrate around the largest banks during periods of high volatility. These banks are probably also best informed. This is especially the case when volatility is high. We interpret this as evidence that heterogeneous expectations are important to an understanding of the volume- volatility relationship.

40|$|A decade-long {{diversification}} of official reserves into riskier investments {{came to an}} abrupt end {{at the beginning of the}} global financial crisis, when many central bank reserve managers started to withdraw their deposits from the banking sector in an apparent flight to quality and safety. We estimate that reserve managers pulled around US$ 500 billion of deposits and other investments from the banking sector. Although clearly not the main cause, this procyclical investment behavior is likely to have contributed to the funding problems of the banking sector, which required offsetting measures by other central banks such as the Federal Reserve and Eurosystem central banks. The behavior highlights a potential conflict between the reserve management and financial stability mandates of central banks. This paper analyzes reserve managers’ actions during the crisis and draws some lessons for strategic asset allocation of reserves going forward.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{alternative ways}} to prevent losses from bank insolvencies. It is widely viewed that transparency in <b>reporting</b> <b>bank</b> balance sheets {{is a key element}} in reducing such losses. It is, however, unclear just how such transparency would be achieved. Current approaches to avoiding insolvencies generally involve international enforcement mechanisms. Among these are the sovereign debt restructuring mechanism (SDRM), and, more generally, an international bankruptcy court. We develop a model that compares two alternative institutions for bank auditing. Neither of these institutions would require as much enforcement capability as an international bankruptcy court, hence they would be easier to introduce. The first of these is a system of central bank auditing of national banks. The second type of auditing is carried out by an international agency that collects risk information on banks in all countries and then provides it to depositors. Using a game- theoretic approach, we compare the informativeness of the disclosure rule in the symmetric Perfect Bayesian equilibrium in each of the two different auditing institutions. We show that the international auditor generally performs at least as well, and sometimes better than, auditing by either central banks, which, in turn, perform better than voluntary disclosure by the banks themselves. The results do not assume any informational advantages of the international auditor, nor is the international auditor somehow less "corrupt" than the central banks. Rather, the international auditor's credibility comes from the simple fact that its incentives are not distorted by a sovereignty bias that plagues the central banks.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} stylized {{sequencing}} of banking supervision and bank restructuring measures designed to complement and expedite {{the adoption of}} indirect instruments of monetary policy. Appropriate sequencing reflects both operational considerations and macroeconomic effects of structural measures. It typically involves implementing initially {{a critical mass of}} reforms of prudential supervision and of financial structure of both banks and enterprises, and subsequently adapting and refining these measures in line with the evolution of markets and internal governance. This approach facilitates implementation because the initial cost of bank restructuring can be offset, partly, through the budgetary effects of improved enterprise finances.

40|$|The paper {{illustrates}} {{the ways in}} which evaluation is distributed throughout Banks’ ARs. More specifically, the similarities and differences in the occurrences of evaluation are foregrounded in four specific sections of the reports (Chairman’s Statement, Chief Executive’s <b>Report,</b> <b>Bank</b> and Business Description and, finally, Corporate Governance Description). On the basis of a cognitive categorization of AR evaluative lexis, a comparative and contrastive analysis of attitudinal vocabulary (viz. adjectives and verbs) was carried out across the four segments. This article, in reporting the findings of the investigation, stresses not only the evaluative aura perceivable throughout ARs but also its ‘good-ness’ (Hunston and Thompson, 2000; Martin, 2000; Stubbs, 2001; White, 2002). Specifically, the study reveals that evaluative adjectives occur most frequently in Chief Executive’s Reports, Chairman’s Statements and Bank and Business Descriptions. While banks’ competitiveness and international importance values are strongly emphasised in Chief Executive’s <b>Reports</b> and <b>Bank</b> and Business Descriptions, innovation appears to be the most notably focused on principle in Chairman’s Statements. Furthermore, the study suggests a clear orientation to customers in all the sections investigated and, in particular, in Corporate Governance Descriptions, in which clients are very often shown to be the primary concern of governance. Verbs also turn out to provide their contribution to the expression of positive evaluation and to a further differentiation of AR segments. On the basis of the twofold categorization of evaluative verbs, the task-oriented ones tend to be more frequently identified in Chief Executive’s <b>Reports,</b> <b>Bank</b> and Business Descriptions, and Chairman’s Statements, whereas the involvement-oriented ones seem to be an exclusive prerogative of Corporate Governance Descriptions...|$|R

The objective of the study is to examine the application of financial ethics in annual financial <b>reporting</b> of <b>banks.</b> The study employed primary and secondary data and stratified and purposive sampling techniques were used in which 20 questionnaires were administered to respondents. ANOVA and chi-square were in analysis and the findings revealed that there are significant unethical practices {{in the preparation of}} financial <b>reports</b> of <b>banks</b> in Nigeria. The study recommends that more emphasis and attention should be given to ethical standards in all banks and banks should give out clear reports of their financial activities to the regulatory authorities...|$|R
50|$|On July 1, 2008 it was <b>reported</b> <b>Banks</b> Broadcasting {{had agreed}} to sell KNIN to Journal Communications (owner of KIVI) which would create Boise's first {{television}} duopoly. On November 10, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) initially rejected the application. Shortly afterward, Banks Broadcasting filed an appeal. The FCC reversed its decision to reject the deal on January 16, 2009. The purchase closed on April 24, at which point KNIN vacated its longtime studios on West Bannock Street in Downtown Boise and was integrated into KIVI's facilities in Nampa.|$|R
5000|$|In the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, a new {{requirement}} {{was laid}} out for banks and credit card merchants to report payments to the IRS. This requirement took effect in 2011, and Form 1099-K was first issued in 2012. It uses third party information <b>reporting</b> (<b>banks</b> and credit card merchants) {{in order to increase}} tax compliance and improve IRS tax assessments. The new requirement specifically does {{much in the way of}} increasing tax compliance from independent contractors, especially with the increasing size of the so-called [...] "1099 economy".|$|R
5000|$|Money Supply (M2) — The {{money supply}} {{measures}} demand deposits, traveler's checks, savings deposits, currency, money market accounts, and small-denomination time deposits. Here, M2 is {{adjusted for inflation}} {{by means of the}} deflator published by the federal government in the GDP <b>report.</b> <b>Bank</b> lending, a factor contributing to account deposits, usually declines when inflation increases faster than the money supply, which can make economic expansion more difficult. Thus, an increase in demand deposits will indicate expectations that inflation will rise, resulting in a decrease in bank lending and an increase in savings.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the effects of the implementation of selected regulations on corporate governance in the <b>reporting</b> practice of <b>banks</b> listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The survey examined the disclosures concerning the main features of the internal control and risk management systems in relation to financial <b>reporting</b> in <b>banks.</b> Research studies on disclosures related to control over financial reporting have not yet been conducted. The paper uses a research method involving the analysis of annual <b>reports</b> disclosed by <b>banks.</b> The method of induction was used in the process of inference. The results of the study indicate that in the practice of <b>reporting</b> of <b>banks</b> listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in 2011, there was no uniform reporting form in terms of the presentation of information on internal control or risk management systems in relation to financial reporting. The disclosures were different both in terms of level of detail and content. In some banks disclosures were drawn at a high level of generality...|$|R
40|$|My {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the information content of bank loans among public firms. I examine why <b>reporting</b> of <b>bank</b> loans in the press {{is associated with a}} positive share price reaction despite the widespread use of loans among public firms. I find that loan restructurings following covenant violations and larger loans relative to firm size {{are more likely to be}} reported in the press. Moreover, I find that although all loans are disclosed, the market reacts only to loans reported before activation. In addition, I study how credit risk and asymmetric information proxies determine loan reporting and incremental financing decisions, and observe that a focus on press reported loans, as previous studies have done, overestimates the importance of these proxies. My findings suggest that reported loans are more noteworthy because they are more informative about the potential of the borrower than non-reported loans, and that the information content of the average <b>reported</b> <b>bank</b> loan decreases during the 1996 through 2004 period...|$|R
