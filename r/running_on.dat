5|$|Brazilian flex {{cars are}} capable of <b>running</b> <b>on</b> just {{hydrated}} ethanol (E100), or just on a blend of gasoline with 20 to 25% anhydrous ethanol (the mandatory blend since 1993), or on any arbitrary combination of both fuels.|$|E
5|$|The {{flexibility}} of Brazilian FFVs empowers the consumers {{to choose the}} fuel depending on current market prices. As ethanol fuel economy is lower than gasoline because of ethanol's energy content is close to 34% less per unit volume than gasoline, flex cars <b>running</b> <b>on</b> ethanol get a lower mileage than when <b>running</b> <b>on</b> pure gasoline. However, this effect is partially offset by the usually lower price per liter of ethanol fuel. As a rule of thumb, Brazilian consumers are frequently advised by the media to use more alcohol than gasoline in their mix only when ethanol prices are 30% lower or more than gasoline, as ethanol price fluctuates heavily depending on the result of seasonal sugar cane harvests.|$|E
