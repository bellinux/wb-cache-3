25|$|On 22 June 1950, the 8th Bomb Squadron went on TDY to Ashiya Airfield, Japan for a Far East Air Force <b>readiness</b> <b>test.</b> On 25 June, North Korea {{crossed the}} 38th {{parallel}} and invaded South Korea.

On 27 June, the United Nations asked its members to go to the aid of the Republic of Korea. On that day the 8th was called on to aid in the Korean police action from their TDY location at Ashiya AB. The first combat mission of the 3d Bomb Group was flown by the 8th that day against the rail yards at Munsan, South Korea. which had been captured by North Korean forces. Their first attack against North Korea was on 29 June when they bombed the main airfield in Pyongyang, making it the first United Nations strike at the Communist forces above the 38th parallel.|$|E

[...] In May, F-94Bs began to re-equip the 68th FAWS at Itazuke Air Base, while rotating pilots and radar operators to Suwon Air Base in South Korea where they flew combat missions over North Korea with the F-82Gs as well as air defense alert over Seoul. [...] In July, the 4th FAWS began receiving the F-94As at Naha Air Base, Okinawa. [...] Training for the squadrons proceeded though the summer and in August, the first Fifth Air Force Operational <b>Readiness</b> <b>Test</b> was held by the 339th FAWS with the F-94.

[...] With the breakout of the Cold War, the usefulness of the airfield by the Air Force became limited, as Giebelstadt was simply too close to the East German border to station tactical aircraft. [...] The flight time for jet aircraft from the border was less than 15 minutes, which meant little or no time was available to launch aircraft from the field before it coming under attack. [...] The airfield, however, remained active as various MATS C-54 Skymaster transport units used the base during 1951-1952; then it was used by various transient transport aircraft throughout the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

40|$|The {{impetus for}} the current work came from {{persistent}} requests from educators for assistance with decisions about allocating children to various pre-reading and reading programs. Our review of existing reading <b>readiness</b> <b>tests</b> revealed that they have two major related weaknesses: (a) {{they are based on}} items which are often far removed from the basic skills necessary for success in reading, and (b) when a student fails to reach an appropriate level of performance on such a test, the pattern of his failures does not provide the teacher with specific indications for remedial work. Indeed, the composition of many so-called reading <b>readiness</b> <b>tests</b> suggests that their authors regard reading readiness as a global characteristic of the child like general intelligence. We take issue with the very concept of reading readiness. The question "Is the student ready to begin a formal reading program? " suggests a discontinuity between the sub-skills involved in reading and the reading process itself, a discontinuity which does not exist. A more appropriate question is "Has the studen...|$|R
