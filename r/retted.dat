40|$|The <b>RET</b> {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} has {{a critical role in}} kidney organogenesis and the development of the enteric nervous system. Two major isoforms, <b>RET</b> 9 and <b>RET</b> 51, differ in the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal tail as a result of alternative splicing. To determine the roles of these isoforms in vivo, we used targeted mutagenesis to generate mice that express either <b>RET</b> 9 or <b>RET</b> 51. Monoisoformic <b>RET</b> 9 mice, which lack <b>RET</b> 51, are viable and appear normal. In contrast, monoisoformic <b>RET</b> 51 animals, which lack <b>RET</b> 9, have kidney hypodysplasia and lack enteric ganglia from the colon. To study the differential activities of the two <b>RET</b> isoforms further, we generated transgenic mice expressing ligand-dependent and constitutively active forms of <b>RET</b> 9 or <b>RET</b> 51 {{under the control of the}} Hoxb 7 regulatory sequences. Such <b>RET</b> 9 transgenes are capable of rescuing the kidney agenesis in RET-deficient mice or causing kidney hypodysplasia in wild-type animals. In contrast, similar <b>RET</b> 51 transgenes fail to rescue the kidney agenesis or cause hypodysplasia.

50|$|The {{plant is}} pulled {{up with the}} roots (not cut), so as to {{increase}} the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then <b>retted.</b> Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown flax and fields, the flax remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks. When the straw is <b>retted</b> and sufficiently dry, it is rolled up. It is then stored by farmers before extracting the fibers.|$|E

40|$|The {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} <b>Ret</b> plays {{a critical role in}} the development of the mammalian excretory and enteric nervous systems. Differential splicing of the primary <b>Ret</b> transcript results in the generation of two main isoforms, <b>Ret</b> 9 and <b>Ret</b> 51, whose C-terminal amino acid tails diverge after tyrosine (Y) 1062. Monoisoformic mice expressing only <b>Ret</b> 9 develop normally and are healthy and fertile. In contrast, animals expressing only <b>Ret</b> 51 have aganglionosis of the distal gut and hypoplastic kidneys. By generating monoisoformic mice in which Y 1062 of <b>Ret</b> 9 has been mutated to phenylalanine, we demonstrate that this amino acid has a critical role in <b>Ret</b> 9 signaling that is necessary for the development of the kidneys and the enteric nervous system. These findings argue that the distinct activities of <b>Ret</b> 9 and <b>Ret</b> 51 result from the differential regulation of Y 1062 by C-terminal flanking sequences. However, a mutation which places Y 1062 of <b>Ret</b> 51 in a <b>Ret</b> 9 context improves only marginally the ability of <b>Ret</b> 51 to support renal and enteric nervous system development. Finally, monoisoformic mice expressing a variant of <b>Ret</b> 9 in which a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif was mutated develop normally and are healthy. Our studies identify Y 1062 as a critical regulator of <b>Ret</b> 9 signaling and suggest that <b>Ret</b> 51 -specific motifs are likely to inhibit the activity of this isoform...|$|R
40|$|<b>RET</b> is a {{tyrosine}} kinase receptor, and transduces signaling by family of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor ligands (GFLs). <b>RET</b> {{is involved in}} the development of enteric nervous system, of sympathetic, parasympathetic, motor and sensory neurons. <b>RET</b> exists in two main isoforms originated by differential splicing, <b>RET</b> 9 and <b>RET</b> 51; phylogenetic {{studies have shown that the}} <b>RET</b> gene is conserved across vertebrates.

40|$|<b>RET</b> gene {{is crucial}} for the {{development}} of enteric nervous system, and dys-regulation of <b>RET</b> expression causes Hirschsprung disease. HOXB 5 regulates <b>RET</b> transcription, and perturbations in transcriptional regulation by HOXB 5 caused reduced <b>RET</b> expression and defective enteric nervous system development in mice. The mechanisms by which HOXB 5 regulate <b>RET</b> transcription are unclear. Thus, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of HOXB 5 on <b>RET</b> transcription could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. In this study, we identified and confirmed HOXB 5 binding to the multi-species conserved sequence (MCS+ 9. 7) in the first intron of the <b>RET</b> gene. We developed a <b>RET</b> mini-gene reporter system, and showed that MCS+ 9. 7 enhanced HOXB 5 trans-activation from <b>RET</b> promoter in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and in chick embryos. The deletion of HOXB 5 binding site interfered with HOXB 5 trans-activation. Furthermore, transfection of HOXB 5 induced endogenous <b>RET</b> transcription, enhanced the co-precipitation of TATA-box binding protein with the transcription start site of <b>RET,</b> and induced histone H 3 K 4 trimethylation in chromatin regions upstream and downstream of <b>RET</b> transcription start site. In conclusion, (i) HOXB 5 physically interacted with MCS+ 9. 7 and enhanced <b>RET</b> transcription, (ii) HOXB 5 altered chromatin conformation and histone modification of <b>RET</b> locus, which could facilitate the formation of transcription complex, and enhance <b>RET</b> transcription, (iii) expression of <b>RET</b> was mediated by a complex regulatory network of transcription factors functioning in a synergistic, additive and/or independent manners.

50|$|Bousillage {{in south}} Louisiana {{is a mixture}} of clay earth and <b>retted</b> Spanish moss, but in the Upper Mississippi River Valley and Canada {{contains}} straw, grass or hair, used to fill in the panels in poteaux-sur-sol, poteaux-en-terre, and half-timbered framing (called colombage in French).

In France the framing was typically in-filled between the post with brick (briquette-entre-poteaux), stone and mud (Pierrotage) or bousillage. There was no stone in south Louisiana, and bricks were not being made during early colonial times. The colonist picked up on a technique that the Native Americans were using to build their wattle and daub structures, and that was heavy clay soil and <b>retted</b> Spanish moss as the binder.

Moreover, in the cerebellum, p 155 (<b>ret)</b> is phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, thus indicating that this brain structure contains p 155 (<b>ret)</b> in an activated state. Finally, the presence of <b>RET</b> in motoneurons prompted us to analyze the effects of hypoglossal nerve section on its expression.

40|$|The glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) {{are critical for}} nervous system development and maintenance. GFLs promote survival and growth via activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) <b>Ret.</b> In sympathetic neurons, the duration of <b>Ret</b> signaling is governed by how rapidly <b>Ret</b> is degraded after its activation. In an effort to elucidate mechanisms that control the half-life of <b>Ret,</b> we have identified two novel <b>Ret</b> interactors, CD 2 -associated protein (CD 2 AP) and Cbl- 3. CD 2 AP, an adaptor molecule involved in the internalization of ubiquitinated RTKs, is associated with <b>Ret</b> under basal, unstimulated conditions in neurons. After <b>Ret</b> activation by GDNF, CD 2 AP dissociates. Similarly, the E 3 -ligase Cbl- 3 interacts with unphosphorylated <b>Ret</b> and dissociates from <b>Ret</b> after <b>Ret</b> activation. In contrast to their dissociation from autophosphorylated <b>Ret,</b> an interaction between CD 2 AP and Cbl- 3 is induced by GDNF stimulation of sympathetic neurons, suggesting that CD 2 AP and Cbl- 3 dissociate from <b>Ret</b> as a complex. In neurons, the overexpression of CD 2 AP enhances the degradation of <b>Ret</b> and inhibits GDNF-dependent survival, and gene silencing of CD 2 AP blocks <b>Ret</b> degradation and promotes GDNF-mediated survival. Surprisingly, Cbl- 3 overexpression dramatically stabilizes activated <b>Ret</b> and enhances neuronal survival, even though Cbl-family E 3 ligases normally function to trigger RTK downregulation. In combination with CD 2 AP, however, Cbl- 3 promotes <b>Ret</b> degradation rapidly and almost completely blocks survival promotion by GDNF, suggesting that Cbl- 3 acts as a switch that is triggered by CD 2 AP and oscillates between inhibition and promotion of <b>Ret</b> degradation. Consistent with the hypothesis, Cbl- 3 silencing in neurons only inhibited <b>Ret</b> degradation and enhanced neuronal survival in combination with CD 2 A...|$|R
50|$|The {{most widely}} practiced method of retting, called water retting, is {{performed}} by submerging bundles of stalks in water. The water, penetrating {{to the central}} stalk portion, swells the inner cells, bursting the outermost layer, thus increasing absorption of both moisture and decay-producing bacteria. Retting time must be carefully judged; under-retting makes separation difficult, and over-retting weakens the fibre. In double retting, a gentle process producing excellent fibre, the stalks are removed from the water before retting is completed, dried for several months, then <b>retted</b> again.|$|E

However, the regulatory elements through which the steroid hormone transcriptional regulation of <b>RET</b> is mediated are poorly defined. Recent genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-based studies have identified 10 putative E 2 receptor-alpha (ESR 1) and RA receptor alpha-binding sites at the <b>RET</b> locus, of which we demonstrate only two (<b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8) display significant E 2 regulatory response when assayed independently in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that endogenous <b>RET</b> expression and <b>RET</b> 249. 8 regulatory activity are cooperatively regulated by E 2 and RA in breast cancer cells. We identify key sequences that are required for <b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8 E 2 responsiveness, including motifs known to be bound by ESR 1, FOXA 1 and TFAP 2 C. We also report that both <b>RET</b> 249. 8 regulatory activity and endogenous <b>RET</b> expression are completely dependent on ESR 1 for their (E 2) -induction and that ESR 1 is sufficient to mediate the E 2 -induced enhancer activity of <b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8.
