40|$|A family {{presenting}} {{several cases}} of severe primary hypercholesterolaemia and/or premature sudden death was studied. This family is characterized <b>by</b> <b>consanguinity,</b> absence of vertical transmission, bimodal distribution of plasma cholesterol values, and reduction of reproductive fitness in affected individuals. The probands have clinical traits of homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, including hypercholesterolaemia, xanthomas and early coronary atherosclerosis, while {{the parents and}} grandparents are clinically normal. Eight relatives on the mother's side experienced premature sudden death, and in four cases hypercholesterolaemia was diagnosed. Haplotype segregation analysis of the inheritance of the LDL receptor and apo B genes in the probands' family excluded the involvement of these two genes in the pathogenesis of the disease. LDL receptor activity, {{as well as the}} ability of LDL to bind to the LDL receptor, and plasma vegetal sterols were within normal limits both in probands and in their relatives. The study of this pedigree suggests that hypercholesterolaemia is not produced by defects in the LDL receptor or LDL particles, and disease inheritance is consistent with an autosomal recessive trait...|$|R
40|$|Allelic {{variation}} in the DR subregion of the human major histocompatibility complex has been analyzed by nucleic acid sequencing of cDNA clones obtained from cell lines homozygous <b>by</b> <b>consanguinity</b> for all the common serological types DR 1 - 9. Two expressed loci were identified in the haplotypes DR 2, - 3, - 4, - 7, and - 9; one locus being present {{at a much lower}} frequency (4 - 7 %) than the other. The low-frequency allele was highly conserved between each of the DRw 53 (DR 4, - 7, - 9) and the DRw 52 (DR 3, - 5, - 6) haplotypes. Analysis of the variation between alleles confirms the presence of three allelic hypervariable regions. At each variable residue, a limited range of amino acid substitutions are found, distinguishing them from immunoglobulin hypervariable regions. Dinucleotide substitutions are extremely common. Individual hypervariable regions are often shared between haplotypes. Much of the {{variation in}} these alleles {{can be attributed to the}} shuffling of these regions between haplotypes, possibly by the mechanism of gene conversion...|$|R
40|$|An {{epidemiological}} {{and genetic}} investigation of myotonia congenita {{was carried out}} in northern Finland. Altogether 58 patients were identified (of whom 54 lived in the study area) in 23 families, with a prevalence of 7. 3 per 100000. The majority of the families originated from a sparsely populated area in western Lapland. The mean age at onset of the disease was 11 years with a range of 2 to 45 years. The mean time that had passed before verification of the clinical disease was 18 (SD 14) years. The sex ratio M/F was 2. 2 / 1. 0. Forty-seven cases were familial and 11 were sporadic. In six families/pedigrees the inheritance was compatible with autosomal recessive and in two families with autosomal dominant inheritance. In five additional families, in which autosomal recessive inheritance seemed most plausible, vertical transmission was also noticed. This could be explained either <b>by</b> <b>consanguinity</b> of the parents or by variant expression of the mutation(s) involved. Our results suggest that myotonia congenita is unusually frequent in northern Finland, most probably as a consequence of an enrichment of the gene mutation(s) in the population...|$|R

40|$|Background: The genetic {{etiology}} of neurodevelopmental defects is extremely diverse, {{and the lack}} of distinctive phenotypic features means that genetic criteria are often required for accurate diagnostic classification. We aimed to identify the causative genetic lesions in two families in which eight affected individuals displayed variable learning disability, spasticity and abnormal gait. Methods: Autosomal recessive inheritance was suggested <b>by</b> <b>consanguinity</b> in one family and by sibling recurrences with normal parents in the second. Autozygosity mapping and exome sequencing, respectively, were used to identify the causative gene. Results: In both families, biallelic loss-of-function mutations in HACE 1 were identified. HACE 1 is an E 3 ubiquitin ligase that regulates the activity of cellular GTPases, including Rac 1 and members of the Rab family. In the consanguineous family, a homozygous mutation p. R 219 * predicted a truncated protein entirely lacking its catalytic domain. In the other family, compound heterozygosity for nonsense mutation p. R 748 * and a 20 -nt insertion interrupting the catalytic HECT domain was present; Western analysis of patient cells revealed an absence of detectable HACE 1 protein. Conclusion: HACE 1 mutations underlie a new autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder. Previous studies have implicated HACE 1 as a tumour suppressor gene; however, since cancer predisposition was not observed either in homozygous or heterozygous mutation carriers, this concept may require re-evaluation...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} consanguineous marriages and estimate the effects of consanguinity on reproductive behaviour and mortality, household and hospital-based surveys were conducted in 11 cities in the Pakistan province of Punjab between 1979 and 1985. The 9520 women interviewed reported 44474 pregnancies, with data collected on maternal and paternal ages at marriage, abortions / miscarriages, stillbirths and deaths in the first month, at 2 - 12 months and 2 - 8 / 10 years. Six categories of consanguineous marriage were included: double first cousin, first cousin, first cousin once removed/double second cousin, second cousin, bradari (brotherhood) and non-consanguineous. Marriages contracted between spouses related as second cousins or closer accounted for 50. 3 % of the total, equivalent to an average coefficient of kinship (a = Ep,^) of 0. 0280. Unions between dose biological relatives were characterized by younger maternal and paternal ages at marriage and reduced spousal age difference, but a longer time to first delivery. Overall, they exhibited greater fertility than non-consanguineous couples. Antenatal and postnatal mortality were assessed <b>by</b> <b>consanguinity</b> and age interval. Consanguinity-associated deaths were consistently higher in the neonatal, infant and childhood periods. The consequences of these outcomes {{on the health of}} the present and future generations is assessed.
