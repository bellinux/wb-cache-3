Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. The changes may indicate developing melanomas. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: To reanalyze the between-population {{variance}} in height, weight, and {{body mass index}} (BMI), {{and to provide a}} globally applicable technique for generating synthetic growth <b>reference</b> <b>charts.</b> Methods: Using a baseline set of 196 female and 197 male growth studies published since 1831, common factors of height, weight, and BMI are extracted via Principal Components separately for height, weight, and BMI. Combining information from single growth studies and the common factors using in principle a Bayesian rationale allows for provision of completed <b>reference</b> <b>charts.</b> Results: The suggested approach can be used for generating synthetic growth <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> with LMS values for height, weight, and BMI, from birth to maturity, from any limited set of height and weight measurements of a given population. Conclusion: Generating synthetic growth <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> by incorporating information from a large set of reference growth studies seems suitable for populations with no autochthonous references at hand yet. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Ultrasound {{estimating}} {{of fetal}} weight {{is one of}} the most frequent examinations during pregnancy. Hitherto, foreign fetometry curves have mostly been used in Poland as there are no national available <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> that are based on ultrasound fetal biometry. The aim of the present study was to construct new charts based on ultrasound fetometry reference for Polish population. Study design: A group of 959 healthy volunteers with uncomplicated singleton pregnancy joined in a cross-sectional study. The study was designed prospectively to evaluate normal <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for fetal ultrasound measurements and estimated fetal weight. Four biometric parameters were studied: biparietal diameter (BPD), head circumference (HQ abdominal circumference (AC) and femur length (FL). Estimated fetal weight (EFW) was calculated using Hadlock et al. formula from 1985. Results: In the course of normal pregnancy an acceleration of growth rate was seen, but with a slight decline at the end of pregnancy, Reference curves for mean, 90 th and 95 th percentile were constructed for BPD, HC, AC and FL. Estimated fetal weight curves were outlined for both boys and girls. Conclusion: <b>Reference</b> <b>charts</b> for Polish population are similar to foreign curves. Less variation was seen in comparison with national charts based on postnatal weight. Ultrasound method seems to be better than birthweight curves especially in preterm pregnancies.

40|$|Background: Growth {{references}} {{are useful for}} the screening, assessment and monitoring of individual {{children as well as}} for evaluating various growth promoting interventions that could possibly affect a child in early life. Aim: To determine the growth centiles of Malaysian children and to establish contemporary cross-sectional growth <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for height and weight from birth to 6 years of age based on a representative sample of children from Malaysia. Methods: Gender-and age-specific centile curves for height and weight were derived using the Cole's LMS method. Data for this study were retrieved from Malaysian government health clinics using a two-stage stratified random sampling technique. Assessment of nutritional status was done with the SD scores (Z-scores) of WHO 2006 standards. Results: Boys were found to be taller and heavier than girls in this study. The median length of Malaysian children was higher than the WHO 2006 standards and CDC 2000 reference. The overall prevalence of stunting and underweight were 8. 3 % and 9. 3 %, respectively. Conclusions: This study presents the first large-scale initiative for local <b>reference</b> <b>charts.</b> The growth <b>reference</b> would enable the growth assessment of a Malaysian child compared to the average growth of children in the country. It is suggested that the use of WHO 2006 Child Growth Standards should be complemented with local <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for a more wholesome growth assessment...|$|R

5000|$|Dip slides are {{incubated}} at 30oC for 48 {{hours after}} being dipped into the sample {{to ensure that}} the results are accurate. After being dipped into the sample the dip slide is returned and secured in its original container for the incubation process. Multiple tests at varying periods are recommended to increase accuracy. It is important that biocides are not applied to the water prior to testing as this would significantly alter the results. The clarity of the sample is not necessarily reflective of the presence of bacteria as seemingly clear water may still have bacteria present. For some water systems a weekly dip slide test is recommended. For multiple tests the incubation period and temperature should be the same each time a new sample is assessed. Bacteria present in the sample liquid will grow and form colonies. A bacterial <b>reference</b> <b>chart</b> is used to determine the number of bacteria in the sample. Appropriate treatment is applied to the water source once abnormal levels of bacterial activity are noticed. Once water treatment is effective the bacterial count produced by the dip slide test should be low, approximately <104. [...] Dip slides are normally used when microbiological activity is relatively high (1,000 - 100,000 CFU per milliliter of water).|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Intravascular {{ultrasound}} (IVUS) -guided stent implantation and {{the availability}} of a <b>reference</b> <b>chart</b> to predict the expected in-stent restenosis rate based on operator-dependent IVUS parameters may interactively facilitate optimal stent placement. The use of IVUS guidance protects against undue risks of dissection or rupture. METHODS AND RESULTS: IVUS-determined post-stent-implantation predictors of 6 -month in-stent restenosis on quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) were identified by logistic regression analysis. These predictors were used to construct a <b>reference</b> <b>chart</b> that predicts the expected 6 -month QCA restenosis rate. IVUS and QCA data were obtained from 3 registries (MUSIC [Multicenter Ultrasound Stenting in Coronaries study], WEST-II [West European Stent Trial II], and ESSEX [European Scimed Stent EXperience]) and 2 randomized in-stent restenosis trials (ERASER [Evaluation of ReoPro And Stenting to Eliminate Restenosis] and TRAPIST [TRApidil vs placebo to Prevent In-STent intimal hyperplasia]). In-stent restenosis was defined as luminal diameter stenosis > 50 % by QCA. IVUS predictors were minimum and mean in-stent area, stent length, and in-stent diameter. Multiple models were constructed with multivariate logistic regression analysis. The model containing minimum in-stent area and stent length best fit the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. This model was used to construct a <b>reference</b> <b>chart</b> to calculate the expected 6 -month restenosis rate. CONCLUSIONS: The expected 6 -month in-stent restenosis rate after stent implantation for short lesions in relatively large vessels can be predicted by use of in-stent minimal area (which is inversely related to restenosis) and stent length (which is directly related to restenosis), both of which can be read from a simple <b>reference</b> <b>chart...</b>|$|E

40|$|Objectives-The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{establish}} <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for fetal corpus callosum length in a convenience sample. Methods-A prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Artemisia Fetal-Maternal Medical Center between December 2008 and January 2012. Among 16, 975 fetal biometric measurements between 19 weeks and 37 weeks 6 days' gestation, 3438 measurements of the corpus callosum (20. 3 %) were available. After excluding 488 measurements (14. 2 %), a total of 2950 fetuses (85. 8 %) were considered and analyzed only once. Parametric and nonparametric quantile regression models were used for the statistical analysis. To evaluate the robustness of the proposed <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> with respect to various distributional assumptions on the sonographic measurements at hand, we compared the gestational age (GA) -specific reference curves produced by the statistical methods used. Results-The mean corpus callosum length was 26. 18 mm (SD, 4. 5 mm; 95 % confidence interval, 26. 01 - 26. 34 mm). The linear regression equation expressing the length of the corpus callosum as a function of GA was length (mm) = 11. 17 + 1. 62 x GA. The correlation between the dimension and gestation was expressed by the coefficient r = 0. 83. Normal mean lengths according the parametric and nonparametric methods were defined for each week of gestation. Conclusions-This work provides new quantile-based <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for corpus callosum length measurements that maybe useful for diagnosis of congenital corpus callosum anomalies in fetal life...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{knowledge}} of energy expenditure in infancy {{is required for}} the estimation of recommended daily amounts of food energy, for designing artificial infant feeds, and as a reference standard for studies of energy metabolism in disease states. Objectives: The objectives of this study were to construct centile <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for total energy expenditure (TEE) in infants across the first year of life. Methods: Repeated measures of TEE using the doubly labeled water technique were made in 162 infants at 1. 5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months. In total, 322 TEE measurements were obtained. The LMS method with maximum penalized likelihood was used to construct the centile <b>reference</b> <b>charts.</b> Centiles were constructed for TEE expressed as MJ/day and also expressed relative to body weight (BW) and fat-free mass (FFM). Results: TEE increased with age and was 1. 40, 1. 86, 2. 64, 3. 07 and 3. 65 MJ/day at 1. 5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months, respectively. The standard deviations were 0. 43, 0. 47, 0. 52, 0. 66 and 0. 88, respectively. TEE in MJ/kg increased from 0. 29 to 0. 36 and in MJ/day/kg FFM from 0. 36 to 0. 48. Conclusions: We have presented centile <b>reference</b> <b>charts</b> for TEE expressed as MJ/day and expressed relative to BW and FFM in infants across the first year of life.
