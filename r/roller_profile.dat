Tapered roller bearings typically employ <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> modification to equalize the load distribution, minimize the stress concentration at the roller ends. Doing FEA (finite element analysis) on the contact stress with the changing roller crowning between roller and races, the appropriate <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> and the crown drop of roller can be achieved. Finally the best control equation of roller crowning is given out. It has important guiding significance {{for the improvement of}} roller crowning design of truck hub bearings...|$|E

The effect of Weibull slope on bearing life prediction was determined. Life factors are proposed to adjust the respective life formulas to the normalized statistical life distribution of each bearing type. The Lundberg-Palmgren method resulted in the most conservative life predictions compared to Ioannides and Harris, and Zaretsky methods which produced statistically similar results. <b>Roller</b> <b>profile</b> can have significant effects on bearing life prediction results. Roller edge loading can reduce life {{by as much as}} 98 percent. The resultant predicted life not only depends on the life equation used but on the Weibull slope assumed, the least variation occurring with the Zaretsky equation.

40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a device and {{a process for}} the conveyance of material, in particular wire- or bar-shaped welding filler material, of different diameters or cross-sectional measurements having one or several permanently integrated feed rollers, i. e. without changing rollers. Said device {{is characterized by the}} fact that the profiles of a drive and an associated counterpressure roller are matched to each other in such a way that the frictional connection is not only ensured with large cross-sectional measurements (e. g. large diameters) of the material to be fed, but also for small cross-sectional measurements (e. g. small wire thicknesses) by the intermeshing of the profiles of the two rollers. This is achieved, for example, by a V groove and a trapezoidal mating profile. The main advantages are the guidance function exerted simultaneously with the feed function, the comparably low deformation op the conveyed material and the adjustable feed velocity which is almost indepedent of the cross-sectional measurements (e. g. wire diameters) of the material as a result of the suitable design of the roller diameter and the <b>roller</b> <b>profiles...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{calculation}} model for fatigue lifetime determination of a three-row roller slewing bearing raceway is presented. First, the contact force distribution between the roller and the raceway is analytically determined from the basic bearing geometry and the external loads {{acting on the}} bearing assembly. Then a numerical model is employed to calculate subsurface stress distribution in the raceway {{as a result of}} the contact force between the roller and the raceway. Numerically calculated subsurface stress field serves as an input for the fatigue calculation of the raceway, which is done according to the stress-life approach. Two different types of rollers are investigated: plain cylindrical <b>roller</b> and a <b>profiled</b> <b>roller.</b> Finally, the influence of the roller geometry on the fatigue life is pointed out...|$|R

40|$|Four roller {{profiles}} used in {{cylindrical roller}} bearing design and manufacture were analyzed using both a closed form solution and finite element analysis (FEA) for stress and life. The roller profiles analyzed were flat, tapered end, aerospace, and fully crowned loaded against a flat raceway. Four rolling-element bearing life models were chosen for this analysis and compared. These were those of Weibull, Lundberg and Palmgren, Ioannides and Harris, and Zaretsky. The flat <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> without edge loading has the longest predicted life. However, edge loading can reduce life {{by as much as}} 98 percent. The end tapered profile produced the highest lives but not significantly different than the aerospace profile. The fully crowned profile produces the lowest lives. The resultant predicted life at each stress condition not only depends on the life equation used but also on the Weibull slope assumed. For Weibull slopes of 1. 5 and 2, both Lundberg-Palmgren and Iaonnides-Harris equations predict lower lives than the ANSI/ABMAJISO standards. Based upon the Hertz stresses for line contact, the accepted load-life exponent of 10 / 3 results in a maximum Hertz stress-life exponent equal to 6. 6. This value is inconsistent with that experienced in the field...|$|E
40|$|Cylindrical roller {{bearings}} typically employ <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> modification to equalize load distribution, minimize stress concentration at roller ends {{and allow for}} {{a small amount of}} misalignment. The 1947 Lundberg-Palmgren analysis reported an inverse fourth power relation between load and life for {{roller bearings}} with line contact. In 1952, Lundberg and Palmgren changed their load-life exponent to 10 / 3 for roller bearings, assuming mixed line and point contact. The effect of roller-crown profile was reanalyzed in this paper to determine the actual load-life relation for modified roller profiles. For uncrowned rollers (line contact), the load-life exponent is p = 4, in agreement with the 1947 Lundberg-Palmgren value but crowning reduces the value of the exponent, p. The lives of modern roller bearings made from vacuum-processed steels significantly exceed those predicted by the Lundberg-Palmgren theory. The Zaretsky rolling-element bearing life model of 1996 produces a load-life exponent of p = 5 for flat rollers, which is more consistent with test data. For the Zaretsky model with fully crowned rollers p = 4. 3. For an aerospace profile and chamfered rollers, p = 4. 6. Using the 1952 Lundberg-Palmgren value p = 10 / 3, the value incorporated in ANSI/ABMA and ISO bearing standards, can create significant life calculation errors for roller bearings...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the development and validation of interactive computer software that aids the design procedures for cam mechanism design, thereby facilitating the optimised design of the mechanism. Attention is focussed on the disc cam-translating roller follower mechanism with respect to which a series of analytical programs have been developed which addresses the design of the complete mechanism. This broad view of the mechanism design as opposed to concentrating on specific features thereof as has hitherto been the case, has been a major objective of the work reported in this thesis. Each analytical program shows the means adopted to satisfy the limiting conditions imposed by kinematic constraints and strength limitations encountered in cam design. The software enables the establishment of the design specification for the manufacture of the cam itself along with as much data on the other features of the mechanism (i. e. the spring, follower, and roller on follower) as project time could permit. A typical run of the software is shown, with the results presented in graphical as well as tabular format. This includes a graphical layout of the cam profile, the <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> on the cam, and the roller and cutter paths around the cam profile. These results have been checked against independent work with good correlation...|$|E

To improve the deposits’ microstructure, the effect of high-pressure interpass rolling was evaluated, and a flat and a <b>profiled</b> <b>roller</b> were compared. The microstructure was changed from large columnar prior beta grains that traversed the component to equiaxed grains that were between 56 and 139 μm in size. The repetitive variation in Widmanstätten alpha lamellae size was retained; however, with rolling, the overall size was reduced. A “fundamental study” was used to gain insight into the microstructural changes that occurred due to the combination of deformation and deposition. High-pressure interpass rolling can overcome many of the shortcomings of AM, potentially aiding industrial implementation of the process. EPSRC, AirBu...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Since the {{grinding}} wheel topography directly influences {{the grinding}} forces and material removal mechanism, the dressing of grinding wheels has a decisive {{role in the}} desired product quality achievement. A new dressing concept is introduced in this paper {{in order to reach}} the optimum chip formation condition. The novel dresser, T-Dress, creates a new structure on the grinding wheel owing to which remarkable reduction in grinding forces occur. These lead to the lower heat generation in the wheel-workpiece contact zone and consequently lower thermal damages. The experiments prove about 40 % lower grinding forces in grinding of bearing steel materials, 100 Cr 6, when dressing with T-Dress compared to the case of dressing with conventional <b>profile</b> <b>rollers</b> with almost no difference in the ground surface roughness values...|$|R
40|$|The {{streamwise}} {{flow structure}} of a turbulent hydraulic jump over a rough bed rectangular channel has been investigated. The flow is divided into inner and outer layers, where upstream supercritical flow changes to downstream subcritical flow. The analysis is based on depth averaged Reynolds momentum equations. The molecular viscosity on the rough bed imposes the no slip boundary condition, but close to the wall the turbulent process in inner layer provides certain matching conditions with the outer layer, where molecular viscosity has no dominant role. It is shown that the bed roughness in the inner layer has a passive role in imposing wall shear stress during formation of hydraulic jump in the outer layer. The Belanger’s jump condition of rectangular channel has been extended {{to account for the}} implications of the drag attributable to channel bed roughness, kinetic energy correction factor, and coefficient of the Reynolds normal stresses. For depth averaged Reynolds normal stress, an eddy viscosity model containing gradient of depth averaged axial velocity is considered. Analytical solutions for sequent depth ratio, jump length, <b>roller</b> length, and <b>profiles</b> of jump depth and velocity were found to depend upon the upstream Froude number, drag owing to bed roughness, and kinetic energy correction factor. On the basis of dynamical similarity, the roller length and aeration length were proposed to be of the same order as the jump length. An effective upstream Froude number, introduced in the present work, yields universal predictions for sequent depth ratio, jump length, <b>roller</b> length, jump <b>profile,</b> and other hydraulic jump characteristics that are explicitly independent of bed roughness drag. Thus, results for hydraulic jump over a rough bed channel can be directly deduced from classical smooth bed hydraulic jump theory, provided the upstream Froude number is replaced by the effective upstream Froude number. These findings of universality have been supported by experimental data over a rough bed rectangular channel...|$|R
40|$|This {{doctoral}} project investigates {{edge contact}} influence on pressure, lubricant film thickness, temperature, and stress distribution of finite line contacts under an elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime. This type of contact represents a common source {{of problems in}} engineering structures such as gears, cams and roller bearings, since non-conforming contact surfaces in such structures undergo intense stresses while transferring loads through relatively small contact areas. Additionally, they induce stressconcentration zones at their extremities; as a result, profile modification becomes necessary. The present study investigates influence of free edges on EHL characteristics of finite line contacts. The initial stage of the research develops a 3 D numerical model for the thermal, non-Newtonian EHL of general contact problems. A semi-analytical method (SAM), based on the Boussinesq half-space theory, is combined with a free boundary correction process to provide a fast and precise description of edge contact conditions. A modified finite difference expansion of the Couette term of the Reynolds equation guarantees computational stability, while the Carreau expression defines the shear-thinning response of the lubricant. Free boundary impact on tridimensional stress distribution is also investigated by extending the free-edge correction procedure to evaluate the levels of surface and subsurface stresses using SAM. The stress distribution data derived from this procedure are then contrasted with Finite Element Method (FEM) results using a two-level factorial comparison. Three dimensionless factors — contact slenderness, contact length ratio, and load — are examined. The comparison shows that the new model developed in this thesis provides {{a high level of}} precision in the evaluation of stress distributions, while computing more than 125 times faster than FEM simulations. This powerful model is then used to investigate and establish the influence of different <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> modifications on EHL film shape, pressure and temperature distributions. Based on a series of detailed analyses of different <b>roller</b> <b>profile</b> corrections, it is found that a large radius crowning combined with rounding corners provides the most effective profile adjustment. In the last step of this study, this newly developed model is combined with a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) to arrive at formulas establishing crowning and corner rounding radii, which {{can be applied to the}} rapid design of optimal rollers. The formulas take into account three dimensionless factors — slenderness, load, and lubricant viscosity — and coefficients for the formulas are derived from the PSO results using a five-level factorial design. By concurrently optimizing three objective functions — contact pressure uniformity, film thickness stability, and maximum load capacity — the predictions of these formulas guarantee optimal profile modifications. This study contributes to the understanding of edge influence on EHL characteristics of finite line contacts, while offering a robust model for axial profile corrections of lubricated contact problems...|$|E
40|$|A {{physical}} {{study of}} hydraulic jump is often undertaken using down-scaled Froude-similar models with Reynolds numbers {{much smaller than}} in prototype (e. g. spillway stilling basins). The potential viscous scale effects may affect a number of physical processes including turbulence development and air entrainment, thus challenging the extrapolation of laboratory data {{to the prediction of}} prototype conditions or justification of numerical modelling. This paper presents an experimental study of hydraulic jumps with a particular focus on the scale effects in terms of free-surface fluctuation and deformation, bubble advection and diffusion, bubble-turbulence interaction and turbulence dissipation. A broad range of free-surface, air–water flow and turbulence properties were measured systematically for Froude numbers from 3. 8 to 10 and Reynolds numbers from 2. 1  ×  10 to 1. 6  ×  10. Based upon self-similarities in the longitudinal evolution of a number of characteristic flow properties, the analytical expressions of time-averaged <b>roller</b> surface <b>profile,</b> void fraction distribution and longitudinal velocity distribution were derived for given Froude number. The roller surface dynamics were found free of scale effects in terms of fluctuation amplitudes but the characteristic frequencies were scale-sensitive. While some air–water flow parameters such as bubble count rate, bubble chord time distribution and bubble grouping behaviour could only be correctly quantified at full-scale prototype conditions, the aeration level and turbulent scales might be estimated with satisfactory accuracy for engineering applications given a model Reynolds number no less than 4  ×  10 to 6  ×  10...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} rolling contact on the {{microstructure}} of case carburized bearing steel {{have been studied}} experimentally, and the results examined, along with {{a review of the}} current literature and theories which are used to explain the observed phenomena. ^ All experimental work utilized tapered rollers from 6. 5 x 12 tapered roller bearings as used in the rail industry. Retained austenite, residual stress, texture and particle size at the roller surface were measured using X-ray diffraction technique. These parameters along with hardness and microstructure were also studied as a function of load-miles on new <b>rollers,</b> and <b>profiles</b> in addition these same parameters were measured as a function of depth in the case carburized layer of several samples. These characteristics were also studied {{as a function of the}} finish grinding operation, and rollers returned from long service were annealed in order to study the extent to which the changes were related to reversible processes. With all studies, whenever possible, measurements were carried out sequentially and at the same location on the rollers. ^ Results of this research has shown that the retained austenite decreases at the surface with service mileage and load, and the residual stresses in the martensite and austenite phases become more compressive. Texture and particle size measurements along with the annealing behavior of the rollers indicated that the most significant contribution to the residual stress is from the transformation of austenite to martensite, although there is evidence that work hardening of austenite is occurring. There appears to be an early limit for most of the transformation of austenite to martensite which appears to be due to the fact that the austenite has become strengthened which then makes further transformation difficult. The behavior of the retained austenite is further classified according to three stages known as shake down, steady state and unstable. ...|$|R
40|$|Sheet metal {{spinning}} {{is one of}} the metal forming processes, where a flat metal blank is rotated at a high speed and formed into an axisymmetric part by a roller which gradually forces the blank onto a mandrel, bearing the final shape of the spun part. Over the last few decades, sheet {{metal spinning}} has developed significantly and spun products have been widely used in various industries. Although the spinning process has already been known for centuries, the process design still highly relies on experienced spinners using trial-and-error. Challenges remain to achieve high product dimensional accuracy and prevent material failures. This PhD project aims to gain insight into the material deformation and wrinkling failure mechanics in the conventional spinning process by employing experimental and numerical methods. In this study, a tool compensation technique has been proposed and used to develop CNC multiple roller path (passes). 3 -D elastic-plastic Finite Element (FE) models have been developed to analyse the material deformation and wrinkling failure of the spinning process. By combining these two techniques in the process design, the time and materials wasted by using the trial-and-error could be decreased significantly. In addition, it may provide a practical approach of standardised operation for the spinning industry and thus improve the product quality, process repeatability and production efficiency. Furthermore, effects of process parameters, e. g. <b>roller</b> path <b>profiles,</b> feed rate and spindle speed, on the variations of tool forces, stresses, strains, wall thickness and wrinkling failures have also been investigated. Using a concave roller path produces high tool forces, stresses and reduction of wall thickness. Conversely, low tool forces, stresses and wall thinning have been obtained in the FE model which uses the convex roller path. High feed ratios help to maintain original blank thickness but also lead to material failures and rough surface finish. Thus it is necessary to find a “trade off” feed ratio for a spinning process design...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} {{trend in the}} development of aerospace industry is to increase load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies, and parts without increasing their size and weight. The above is also true for widely used in aircrafts and the most promising up to date Epicyclic Roller-Screw Mechanisms (ERSM) that convert rotational movement into translational one. Previously (in the article), it was proposed to increase the load capacity (approximately by 15 %) through reduction of included angle of ERSM threaded parts from 90 ° to 70 °. However, such improvement of ERSM will change dimensions of the mechanism parts and its parameters and characteristics (efficiency factor, position of initial point of contact of the conjugated thread turns and parameters of their contact interaction, as well as kinematic parameters), which will require additional studies. If we take into account the priority of these studies, then surely we must begin with development of technique to determine dimensions of the ERSM main parts and their tolerance zones because we need drawings to manufacture and test the upgraded ERSM. We have developed a technique to calculate dimensions of the main parts of ERSM and associated tolerance zones that takes in to account the change of included angle of threaded parts of the mechanism and radius of circular arc according to which <b>roller</b> thread <b>profile</b> has been fulfilled. So the proposed technique is the general one in comparison with the previous ones. This technique uses various conditions and equations to determine dimensions of parts and associated tolerance zones. For example, a nut encircles a screw with rollers, and their dimensions form a closed dimension chain, in which the dimensions and associated tolerances must be such as to ensure ERSM assembling, on the one hand, and, on the other hand the backlash of the mechanism should be minimal to ensure high load capacity, kinematic accuracy, and rigidity of ERSM. We used the following conditions: a lack of sharp thread turns on the screw, rollers and nut; thread turn of roller with minimal thickness is in the root of nut with maximal width; thread turn of roller with minimal thickness is in the root of screw with maximal width, taking into consideration the ERSM design features. Concurrently, possible wear out of threaded surfaces of ERSM parts is taken into account. </p...|$|R
40|$|The large {{residual}} stresses which occur in welded objects are an unavoidable {{consequence of the}} non-uniform cycle of thermal strain inherent in most welding processes. Furthermore, the particular distributions of residual stress which are characteristic of welding can adversely influence several material and structural failure mechanisms, including fatigue fracture, elastic fracture and buckling. This thesis describes an experimental investigation into the use of localised high-pressure rolling of the weld seam {{for the purpose of}} residual stress reduction in steel welds. In preliminary experiments, it is demonstrated that the transient stresses which occur in an object while part of it is welded or rolled, can be inferred from strain measurements taken during the process. Furthermore, such measurements can be used to estimate the resulting {{residual stresses}}. Good agreement is observed between residual stress distributions found using this method and determined using neutron diffraction. The effect of rolling on residual stress in structural steel welds is then investigated using both of these measurement techniques. Rolling is shown to greatly reduce tensile residual stress at the weld seam, even introducing compressive stress when a greater rolling force is used. However, this is only the case when rolling is applied post-weld: by contrast, methods involving rolling prior to or during welding do not improve the residual stress distribution. It is proposed, on the basis of transient stress measurements, that this is because the deformation which occurs in a weld during cooling greatly exceeds its yield strain, and so any effect of high-temperature deformation on residual stress is subsequently erased. Other effects of rolling on the properties of a weld have also been studied. Using mechanical tests and microstructural analysis it is shown that while post-weld rolling causes work-hardening of structural steel welds, rolling the weld at high temperature results in refinement of the weld microstructure, also hardening it. The effect of roller geometry on residual stress and fatigue life of rolled specimens has been investigated: the induced residual stress distribution is relatively insensitive to the <b>roller’s</b> crosssectional <b>profile,</b> while the fatigue life is shown to be reduced by post-weld rolling. The implications of these findings for the practical implementation of weld rolling, along with many other applied aspects of the process are discussed. While rolling is undoubtedly a useful and highly effective tool for residual stress mitigation in welds, its secondary effects should always be carefully considered...|$|R
40|$|Fusion welding {{processes}} cause residual stress {{due to the}} uneven heat distribution produced by the moving welding torch. These residual stresses are characterised by a large tensile component in the welding direction. Due to the self-equilibrated nature of the residual stress, compressive ones {{are present in the}} far field next to the weld seam, which can cause different kind of distortion such as bending or buckling. Welding residual stress can be responsible of premature failure of the components, such as stress crack corrosion, buckling, and reduction of fatigue life. Localised rolling is a stress engineering technique {{that can be used to}} reduce the residual stress and distortion caused by welding. It induces plastic strain in the rolling direction, counteracting the plastic strain produced during welding. In this thesis three techniques were investigated, pre-weld rolling, post-weld rolling, and in situ rolling. These techniques have been seldom studied in the past, particularly pre-weld rolling; consequently the mechanisms are poorly understood. Finite element models allow stress and strain development during both welding and rolling processes to be better understood, providing an improved understanding of the mechanisms involved and aiding process development. A literature survey was done to find the state of the art of the computational welding mechanics simulations, stress management, and the residual stress measurement techniques, as well as the knowledge gaps such as, the thermal losses through the backing-bar in the thermal simulation, the frictional interaction in the rolling process, and the material properties of the steel used in the models. In the literature not many models that investigate the management of welding residual stress were found. After this, the general considerations and assumptions for the welding thermal mechanical models presented in this thesis were discussed. The effect of different backing-bar conditions, as well as different material properties where investigated. Both influenced the residual stress profile to varying degrees. In particular, temperature dependent heat loss to the backing-bar was necessary to capture the improved heat loss near the weld. The distortion predicted by the model was investigated to determine whether it was due to bending or buckling phenomena. Lastly, the temperature distribution and residual stress predictions were validated against thermocouple and neutron diffraction measurements conducted by Coules et al. [1 – 3]. Pre-weld rolling was the first of the three rolling methods considered, in which rolling is applied to the plates before performing GMA butt-welds. The principle behind this technique consisted in inducing tensile residual stress in the weld region before welding; therefore, it is similar to mechanically tensioning the weld, which can significantly reduce the residual stress and distortion. However, there was no significant change in the tensile residual stresses. On the other hand, it was possible to achieve a small reduction in the distortion, when the plates were rolled on the opposite surface to the weld; rolling in this way induced distortion in the opposite direction to the distortion induced by welding, reducing the magnitude of the latter. These results were compared with experiments conducted by Coules et al. [1, 4]. A subsequent investigation combined pre-weld rolling with post-weld heating. With this additional process the residual stress and distortion were significantly reduced, and flatter residual stress profile was achieved. The post-weld rolling and in situ rolling techniques were discussed afterwards. In the post-weld rolling models, rolling was applied after the weldment was cooled to room temperature. In in situ rolling the roller was applied on top of the weld bead at some distance behind the torch, while it was still hot. The principle behind these techniques consisted in applying positive plastic strain to the weld bead region by a roller, counteracting the negative plastic strains produced in the welding process. Two <b>roller</b> <b>profiles</b> were investigated, namely, grooved, and double flat rollers. The post-weld rolling on top of the weld bead models, which used the grooved roller, showed good agreement against experimental results, producing a large reduction of the residual stress and distortion. Some discrepancies were present when the weld toes were rolled with the dual flat roller. The former roller was more efficient for reducing residual stress and distortion. The influence of different friction coefficients (between the roller and weldment, and between the backing-bar and the weldment), were investigated. It showed significant dependency on the residual stress distribution when high rolling loads were used. The frictional interaction constrained the contact area inducing more compressive stress in the core of the weld bead; therefore it produced more tensile residual stress in the surface of the weldment. Additionally, the influence of rolling parameters on the through-thickness residual stress variation was investigated. Low loads only influence the residual stress near the surface, while high loads affected the material through the entire thickness. When the dual flat roller was used to roll next to the weld bead, significant compressive residual stress was induce in the weld bead; however, the residual stress reduction was very sensitive to the contact of the roller to the weld toes; therefore, when rolling a weld bead that varies in shape along the weld, the residual stress reduction is not uniform and varies along the length. On the other hand, the in situ rolling did not produced significant residual stress or distortion reduction in all the cases analysed. The rolling occurred when the material was still hot and the residual stress was subsequently formed as the material cooled to room temperature. Numerical modelling was a very useful tool for understanding the development of stress and plastic strain during the welding and rolling processes...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump is a rapid {{transition from a}} high-velocity open channel flow to a slower fluvial motion. It is commonly experienced in streams and rivers, in industrial channels and during manufacturing processes. Herein new detailed air-water flow characteristics were measured in the developing shear layer of {{hydraulic jump}}s with partially-developed inflow. The measurements were conducted in a relatively large-size facility with large Froude numbers (5. 1 < Fr 1 < 11. 2). In the developing shear layer, the distributions of void fractions were modelled by an advective diffusion equation. The experimental data demonstrated a close agreement with the theoretical developments, and the air bubble diffusivity was observed to be independent of the Froude and Reynolds numbers although increasing linearly with {{the distance from the}} jump toe. The experimental observations highlighted a strong air entrainment rate as well as some spray and splashing above the roller. The measurements of jump toe fluctuations were close to earlier studies. The new data showed that the jump toe oscillation frequency was equal to the production rate of large-scale vortical structures in the developing shear layer, and the average convection speed of the large coherent structures was in average Vej/V 1 = 0. 32. The void fraction distributions presented a local maximum in the air-water shear layer and its value decreased quasi-exponentially with increasing distance from the jump toe. The shear zone was also characterised by a maximum in bubble count rate. The depth-averaged void fraction data demonstrated a large amount of entrained air as well as a rapid de-aeration of the jump <b>roller.</b> The velocity <b>profiles</b> followed closely some wall jet equations, and the air-water turbulent properties indicated some increasing turbulence levels with increasing distance from the bed. The bubble chord time distributions exhibited a broad range of entrained bubble chord times spreading over several orders of magnitudes. A detailed analysis of the longitudinal structure of the air and water chords suggested a significant proportion of bubble clustering in the developing shear region, especially immediately downstream of the jump toe. The data showed further that, in the shear layer, there was no preferential bubble chord time in the cluster structures. Overall the study highlighted that the convection of air in the mixing zone was an advective diffusion process, although there was some rapid flow de-aeration for all Froude numbers.

40|$|Modelling and {{simulation}} in tribology, {{and more}} specifically of friction in lubricated contacts, has gained increasing attention over the past years. In a lubricated contact, the dissipation of energy {{is due to the}} relative motion of the mating surfaces and arise due to direct contact as well as shearing of the lubricant film. The presence of a thin lubricant film is crucial for the operation of various machine elements, e. g., for the concentrated contact between the rolling element and the raceway in a bearing. The contact in this type of applications is typically exhibiting substantial elastic deformation which together with hydrodynamics governs the formation of the lubricant film. Therefore, these type of contacts are said to operate in the Elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) regime. An elastohydrodynamically lubricated contact can be classified as line, circular or elliptical. The line contacts can also represent a truncated ellipse or be of finite length. The line contact that appears between two cylindrically shaped bodies of infinite length does of course not exist in reality. It does, however, constitute an important type of simplification of the contact in real applications where the contact length perpendicular to direction of motion is comparatively large. The {{reason for this is that}} it permits a 2 D-model for the flow and there are analytical solutions, at least in the most elementary cases. The circular and the fully elliptical contacts are more complicated. The case where the surfaces are fully separated by the lubricant film has, however, been addressed by many researchers and there are quite a few papers reporting numerical predictions validated by experimental data. The finite length line and truncated elliptical contact are even more challenging, but these are also the only physically reasonable models for EHL contacts exhibiting edge effects, created by <b>profiled</b> <b>rollers</b> or in cases where the contact ellipse becomes larger than the physical size of the contacting elements. This thesis presents the development of a fully coupled model that can be used to predict the pressure build-up and lubricant film formation in finite length line contacts. More precisely, in EHL contacts where the rolling element have profiled edges (fillets) and the surface of the counteracting element is wider than the roller, e. g., in a typical cam-roller follower contact. Hereafter this type of contact will be referred to as a 'finite EHL line contact'. The numerical analyses, conducted with the present model, were designed so that generic knowledge about friction in cam-roller follower applications would be generated, but also to provide for the development of a semi-analytical for fast and efficient estimation of friction. There are quite a few parameters that affect the friction in EHL contacts and it is already a challenge to include the most basic ones in the model. The most advanced and sophisticated models are very complex with millions of degrees of freedom and are, therefore, not yet feasible to conduct parametric studies with. The extreme conditions associated with EHL, i. e., nm thin films, with phase transition from liquid to solid, GPa pressure, temperature increase with considerable implications on lubricant flow and surface chemistry, etc., makes it even more difficult to model these systems. When modelling a cam-roller follower application, which typically results in a finite length EHL line contact, the size and geometry of the contacting parts further complicates modeling of EHL. The main objective, with this thesis project, was to design a low degree of freedom model that can be employed in a multibody dynamics model, to estimate EHL friction in milliseconds and yet capturing the most important features of a lubricated contact including edge effects. This resulted in a semi-analytical low degree of freedom (LDOF) model taking thermal effects into account and that include lubricant shear thinning and compressibility, in order to estimate the viscosity and volume of the lubricant. In addition, this LDOF model was extended to perform friction prediction covering the mixed lubrication regime where colliding asperities partially influence shearing of the lubricant. The extended, mixed lubrication LDOF, model was utilized to perform friction predictions covering a range of operating conditions, which were also covered in an experimental investigation using a ball-on-disk test device. The results turned out to compare well, suggesting that the model established in this project, is a usable tool that can be employed when designing lubricated devices and that it constitutes a suitable foundation for further developments...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} work {{presented in this}} thesis is concerned with analytical, numerical and experimental studies {{of the effect of}} cold rolling on the fatigue behaviour of threaded drillstring connections. A comprehensive literature study is made of the various effects on the fatigue behaviour of residual stresses introduced by mechanical deformation of notched components. Some of the effects studied are cyclic hardening behaviour after prestraining, cyclic creep, fatigue initiation in prestrained materials, short cracks and crack growth models including crack closure. Residual stresses were introduced in the surface of a smooth pipe by a rolling device to simulate a cold rolling process and verify the calculated residual stresses by measurements. Strain hardening and contact algorithm of the two bodies were incorporated in the FE analyses. Two significant errors were found in the commercial software package for residual stress evaluation, Restan v. 3. 3. 2 a also called SINT, when using the Schajer method. The Schajer algorithm is the only hole-drilling algorithm without theoretical shortcomings, and is recommended when measuring large residual stress gradients in the depth directions. Using the Schajer method solved by in-house Matlab-routines good agreement between measured residual stress gradients and residual stress gradients from FE analyses was found. Full scale fatigue tests were performed on pipes cut used drillstrings with notches of similar geometry as threads used in drillstring connections. The simulated threads consisted of four full depth helix notches with runouts at the surface. The pipe threads were cold rolled and fatigue tested in a full-scale four-point rotating bending fatigue testing rig. The test results showed that cold rolling had an effect on the crack initiating period. A major part of the fatigue life was with cracks observed at the notch root, but due to the increased fatigue crack propagation resistance the final fracture initiated at pits inside the pipe. Therefor, an optimisation of the roll geometry and rolling parameters was not possible. However, a significant fatigue life improvement was achieved. Based on experiments, a <b>roller</b> with similar <b>profile</b> as the thread root is recommended. A rolling force of maximum 20 KN is recommended to minimise the possibility of damaging the thread profile. Shallow cracks were observed typically when 5 % of the fatigue life had expired. Re-rolling after 50 % of expected improved fatigue life, when also short cracks were observed in the notch roots further increased the fatigue improvements. Pretensioned small steel specimens with a notch were used to simulate cold rolled threats. The specimens were fatigue tested in tension with minimum load close to zero. Pretensioning increased the fatigue life form approximately 50 000 cycles to an infinite number of cycles. In these test non-propagating cracks of typically 0. 4 mm length were found. The benefit from pretensioning gradually disappeared with increasing mean stress. FE analyses indicated that an almost instant relaxation of residual stresses to a level with no monotonic strain hardening from preloading would take place when cycled to moderate mean stress. Cycled at low mean stress, an instant relaxation of the surface layer was found in analysis. All observations from notched pretensioned fatigue specimens were in good agreement with the available literature. However, preloading was found to be strain rate dependent in tests where a pretension load held for 2 minutes gave a longer fatigue life than a sinusoidal loading-unloading cycle performed over a one minute interval. Strain hardening was found not contributing to the fatigue life improvement, whereas the polishing effect from improved surface quality after cold rolling increased the fatigue initiation period. However, residual stress and subsequent early crack closure was the dominating effect at moderate cyclic mean loads. The material data required to perform FE fatigue simulation studies of a full threaded cold rolled coupling incorporating make-up torque, include cyclic stress strain behaviour at various amplitudes and mean stress caused by various degrees of prestraining. Such data are not readily available today, and are only possible to obtain in carefully planned and executed experiments. Also, 3 D FE model required for cold rolling analysis is extremely CPU time consuming. Consequently, cold rolling simulations could not be successfully implemented in this work. One of the main conclusions from this work is that drillstring connections will respond differently to thread rolling at the pin or box. A significant improvement in the fatigue life of box threads from residual stresses is expected mainly from increased resistance to crack propagation. However, the compressive residual stress is sensitive to overloading in compression, and the improvement from residual stress depends strongly on the mean stress (or R-ratio). At values of R of approximately 0. 6 or higher the beneficial of rolling therefore tends to disappear. At the critical locations of the pin, which are the last engaged thread or the stress relief groove, the effect of residual stresses introduced by rolling is therefore likely to be severely reduced by the high mean stress imposed during make-up of the connection. However, a beneficial effect of rolling is expected to remain due to improved surface condition and due to a possible effect of strain hardening. The net results of these factors on the fatigue performance of actual drillstrings can only be determined in full scale rotating bending tests. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|R
