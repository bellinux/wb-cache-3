5|$|In its 2007 expose , the {{political}} weekly Tehelka released hidden camera footage of {{several members of}} the Bharatiya Janata Party, Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal admitting their role in the riots. While the report was criticised for being politically motivated, some newspapers said the revelations simply reinforced what was common knowledge. Several inaccuracies in the statements cast doubt on the sting operation. Bajrangi and Suresh <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> that Narendra Modi visited Naroda Patiya a day after the massacre to thank them, but the official record shows that Modi did not visit Naroda Patiya. The Gujarat government blocked cable news channels from broadcasting the expose, an action which was criticised by the Editors Guild of India.|$|E
25|$|In 1805, Detroit {{experienced}} a devastating fire, which destroyed {{most of the}} city's French colonial architecture. Shortly afterward, Father Gabriel <b>Richard</b> <b>said,</b> Speramus meliora; resurget cineribus, meaning, We hope for better things; it will arise from the ashes, which became the city's official motto. For Detroit, Justice Augustus B. Woodward devised a plan similar to Pierre Charles L'Enfant's design for Washington, D.C.. Detroit's monumental avenues and traffic circles fan out in a Baroque styled radial fashion from Grand Circus Park {{in the heart of}} the city's theater district.|$|E
500|$|Monet {{submitted}} The Magpie and Fishing Boats at Sea (W 126) to the Salon of 1869. Both {{paintings were}} rejected in April. Critic Paul <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> that the jurors rejected the painting as [...] "too common and too coarse". Monet's experimental {{use of color}} and radical departure from the descriptive, academic style surprised the public and probably contributed to its dismissal by the jury. Monet told French novelist Arsène Houssaye (18151896), [...] "This rejection has taken the bread from my mouth, {{and in spite of}} my low prices, collectors and dealers turn their backs on me." [...] A century later, The Magpie was acquired by the Musée d'Orsay in 1984. It {{became one of the most}} popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Hello Good Morning" [...] was {{directed}} by Hype Williams, and premiered on May 11, 2010, through the group's official VEVO account. Later on May 23, 2010, a behind the scenes video was released, revealing that the video was filmed in Agua Dulce, California and Los Angeles. Swizz Beatz, Rico Love and Rick Ross all make cameos in the video. The video uses a remix of the song {{which is the same}} as the album version, but features an introduction rap from Ross. Dawn <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> the concept of the video was based on the 1995 film Heat starring Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. T.I.'s scenes were amongst the last to be filmed, and took place in an apartment in Bel Aire, CA.|$|E
500|$|Presley's rise to {{national}} attention in 1956 transformed {{the field of}} popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture. As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude. With its racially mixed origins—repeatedly affirmed by Presley—rock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture. In this regard, Little <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> of Presley, [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He {{opened the door for}} black music." [...] Al Green agreed: [...] "He broke the ice for all of us." [...] President Jimmy Carter remarked on his legacy in 1977: [...] "His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture. His following was immense, and he was a symbol to people the world over of the vitality, rebelliousness, and good humor of his country." [...] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: at the age of 21, within a year of his first appearance on American network television, {{he was one of the}} most famous people in the world. John Lennon stated that [...] "Before Elvis there was nothing." [...] Lennon also said that [...] "Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been an Elvis, there wouldn't have been the Beatles." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{being told}} {{he would not}} be charged in June 2016, <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> that he is {{considering}} suing the BBC. [...] The BBC apologized for [...] "distress" [...] caused by their coverage but stood by the story as they believed it was in the public interest.|$|E

But <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> he wouldn't join us full time {{because he wanted to}} continue with his other band, but we had to get another guitarist because of the improvement in the sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1188, Raymond {{attacked}} again, {{joined by}} the Lusignans, vassals of Richard. It was rumoured that Henry himself had financed the revolts. Philip attacked Henry in Normandy and captured strongholds in Berry, then they met to discuss peace again. Henry refused to make Richard his heir, with one story reporting that <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Now at last, I must believe what I had always thought impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, the A {{graphics}} department hired Craig Braun and Associates {{to design}} the album cover for their third album. [...] "I recognized {{it to be a}} great logo as soon as I saw it", says Richard. The logo was used on every Carpenters album thereafter; <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> it was done [...] "to keep things consistent". The logo did not appear on the front cover of Passage but a small version appeared on the back cover.|$|E

2500|$|In February 2010, <b>Richards</b> <b>said</b> that a [...] "turning point" [...] {{had been}} reached {{in the battle against}} the Taliban. He {{suggested}} troop numbers could begin to decline as early as 2011 while the majority would be withdrawn by 2015. <b>Richards</b> <b>said</b> [...] "we are now seeing some very optimistic signs" [...] in the latest military offensive, Operation Moshtarak (togetherness), in Helmand. The Taliban had been forced to give [...] "serious consideration" [...] about continuing the fight. <b>Richards</b> <b>said</b> that: [...] "We expect the military conflict to trail off in 2011," [...] who was visiting British front-line forces {{for the first time since}} taking command of the Army last year. [...] "The combat role will start to decline in 2011, but we will remain militarily engaged in training and support roles for another five years, and we will remain in a support role for many years to come." ...|$|R
2500|$|On October 12, 1983, {{eight months}} after Karen's death, the Carpenter family celebrated the {{unveiling}} of the Carpenters' new star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> in his speech, [...] "This is a sad day, {{but at the same}} time a very special and beautiful day to my family and me. My only regret is that Karen is not physically here to share it with us, but I know that she is very much alive in our minds, and in our hearts." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{current policy}} was {{accepted}} {{at the lower}} ranks first, with many senior officers worrying for their troops without a modern acceptance of homosexuality that their personnel had grown up with. One Brigadier resigned but with little impact. Since the change support at the senior level has grown. General Sir Richard Dannatt, the Chief of the General Staff (head of the Army), told members of the Army-sponsored Fourth Joint Conference on LGBT Matters that homosexuals were welcome {{to serve in the}} Army. In a speech to the conference in 2008, {{the first of its kind}} by any Army chief, General Sir <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> that respect for LGBT officers and soldiers was now [...] "a command responsibility" [...] and was vital for [...] "operational effectiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard {{remained}} forever grateful {{and loving}} to Cis throughout his life, later {{going on to}} say: [...] "When my mother died she, my sister, had become my mother, and more mother to me than any mother could ever have been... I was immensely proud of her... she felt all tragedies except her own." [...] Daddy Ni would occasionally visit the homes of his grown daughters but was otherwise absent. Another important figure in Richard's early life was Ifor, his brother, 19 years his senior. A miner and rugby union player, Ifor [...] "ruled the household with the proverbial firm hand". He was also responsible for nurturing a passion for rugby in young Richard. Although Richard also played cricket, tennis, and table tennis, biographer Bragg notes rugby union football to be his greatest interest. On rugby, <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> he [...] "would rather have played for Wales at Cardiff Arms Park than Hamlet at The Old Vic". The Welsh rugby union centre, Bleddyn Williams believed Richard [...] "had distinct possibilities as a player".|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the facts that Nat King Cole had the #7 song in 1959, and the #1 song in 1921, and Chuck Berry had a major hit with [...] "Maybellene" [...] in 1955, in the United States in the 1950s legal {{segregation}} and discrimination against African Americans was common, especially in the Deep South. Presley would nevertheless publicly cite his debt to African American music, pointing to artists such as B. B. King, Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup, Ivory Joe Hunter, and Fats Domino. The reporter who conducted Presley's first interview in New York City in 1956 noted that he named blues singers who [...] "obviously {{meant a lot to}} him. [...] was very surprised to hear him talk about the black performers down there and about how he tried to carry on their music." [...] Later that year in Charlotte, North Carolina, Presley was quoted as saying: [...] "The colored folks been singing it and playing it just like I’m doin' now, man, for more years than I know. They played it like that in their shanties and in their juke joints and nobody paid it no mind 'til I goosed it up. I got it from them. Down in Tupelo, Mississippi, I used to hear old Arthur Crudup bang his box the way I do now and I said if I ever got to a place I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] Little <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> of Presley: [...] "He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music." [...] B. B. King said he began to respect Presley after he did Arthur [...] "Big Boy" [...] Crudup material and that after he met him, he thought the singer really was something else and was someone whose music was growing all the time right up to his death.|$|E
60|$|We held many {{consultations}} {{about what}} Richard was to be, first without Mr. Jarndyce, {{as he had}} requested, and afterwards with him, {{but it was a}} long time before we seemed to make progress. <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> he was ready for anything. When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy, <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> he had thought of that, and perhaps he was. When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the Army, <b>Richard</b> <b>said</b> he had thought of that, too, and it wasn't a bad idea. When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse, Richard answered, Well he really HAD tried very often, and he couldn't make out.|$|E

500|$|In 1971, in an {{interview}} with Rolling Stone magazine, <b>Richards</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "We played pretty bad until near the end, because we hadn't played for years ... Nobody minded, because they just wanted to hear us play again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{there were}} a few more of us," [...] <b>Richards</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I should vote for our {{beginning}} it. If we were to fall suddenly upon them we might kill a lot and scare the rest off." ...|$|R
