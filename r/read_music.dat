5|$|At {{the age of}} six, Flanagan's parents {{gave him}} a {{clarinet}} for Christmas. He learned to <b>read</b> <b>music</b> from playing the clarinet, but {{within a few years}} he preferred the piano. The family had a piano in the house, and Flanagan received lessons from one of his brothers, Johnson, and Gladys Wade Dillard, who also taught Kirk Lightsey and Barry Harris. Flanagan graduated from Northern High School, which he attended with other future musicians, including Sonny Red.|$|E
5|$|Jo Elizabeth Stafford {{was born}} in Coalinga, California, in 1917, to Grover Cleveland Stafford and Anna Stafford (née York)a second cousin of World War I hero Sergeant Alvin York. She was the third of four children. Both her parents enjoyed singing and sharing music with their family. Stafford's father hoped {{for success in the}} California oil fields when he moved his family from Gainesboro, Tennessee, but worked in a {{succession}} of unrelated jobs. Her mother was an accomplished banjo player, playing and singing many of the folk songs which influenced Stafford's later career. Anna insisted that her children should take piano lessons, but Jo was the only one among her sisters who took a keen interest in it, and through this she learned to <b>read</b> <b>music.</b>|$|E
5|$|Art Farmer {{was born}} {{an hour before}} his twin brother, on August 21, 1928, in Council Bluffs, Iowa, {{reportedly}} at 2201 Fourth Avenue. Their parents, James Arthur Farmer and Hazel Stewart Farmer, divorced when the boys were four, and their steelworker father {{was killed in a}} work accident not long after this. Art moved with his grandfather, grandmother, mother, brother and sister to Phoenix, Arizona when he was still four. He started to play the piano while in elementary school, then moved on to bass tuba and violin before settling on cornet and then trumpet at the age of thirteen. His family was musical: most of them played as a hobby, and one was a professional trombonist. Art's grandfather was a minister in the African Methodist Episcopal Church. This influenced Farmer's first choice of instrument, as his mother played piano for the church choir. The bass tuba was for use in a marching band and was Farmer's instrument for a year, until a cornet became available. Phoenix schools were segregated, and no one at Farmer's school could provide useful music lessons. He taught himself to <b>read</b> <b>music</b> and practiced his new main instrument, the trumpet.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, one of Pavarotti's former managers, Herbert Breslin, {{published}} a book, The King & I. Seen {{by many as}} bitter and sensationalistic, it is critical of the singer's acting (in opera), his inability to <b>read</b> <b>music</b> well and learn parts, and his personal conduct, although acknowledging their success together. In an interview in 2005 with Jeremy Paxman on the BBC, Pavarotti rejected the allegation {{that he could not}} <b>read</b> <b>music,</b> although he acknowledged he did not read orchestral scores.|$|E

25|$|In {{his early}} days as a session player Foster, having been self-taught, could not <b>read</b> <b>music</b> and freely admits that he bluffed {{his way through a}} lot of sessions.

He then taught as a music school teacher in Birmingham.|$|E
25|$|Players {{traditionally}} learn old-time {{music by}} ear; even musicians who can <b>read</b> <b>music.</b> A broad selection of written music does exist, although {{many believe that}} the style of old-time music cannot be practically notated by written music. This is in part {{because there are many}} regional and local variations to old-time tunes, and because some of the most noted players often improvised and wouldn't play a tune exactly the same way every time.|$|E

He then devoted his efforts to practicing the guitar and <b>reading</b> <b>music.</b> Guitar books geared toward <b>reading</b> <b>music</b> were virtually non-existent at the time, so Pitman used books for other instruments to acquire his sight reading skills. Oboe books were especially prized because they described the same range as the guitar.|$|R
25|$|Buckingham {{never took}} guitar lessons {{and does not}} <b>read</b> <b>music.</b> By age 13, he became {{interested}} in folk music and, influenced by banjo methods, practiced the energetic style of the Kingston Trio.

25|$|Benny Moré, {{considered}} {{by many as the}} greatest Cuban singer of all time, was in his heyday in the 1950s. He had an innate musicality and fluid tenor voice, which he colored and phrased with great expressivity. Although he could not <b>read</b> <b>music,</b> Moré was a master of all the genres, including son montuno, mambo, guaracha, guajira, cha cha cha, afro, canción, guaguancó, and bolero. His orchestra, the Banda Gigante, and his music, was a development – more flexible and fluid in style – of the Perez Prado orchestra, which he sang with in 1949–1950.|$|E

25|$|Clinical {{symptoms}} of acquired amusia {{are much more}} variable than those of congenital amusia and {{are determined by the}} location and nature of the lesion.

Additionally, brain damage to the receptive dimension affects the faculty to discriminate tunes (receptive or sensorial amusia), the ability to <b>read</b> <b>music</b> (musical alessia), and the ability to identify songs that were familiar prior to the brain damage (amnesic amusia).|$|E

25|$|These clauses could {{potentially}} outlaw any free software capable of reading DRM-using formats (music, video, or even text content); the {{fear was that}} free software implementing DRM would be construed as facilitating circumvention. Designers of software knowingly facilitating circumvention would, with the initial draft, face felony charges of counterfeiting with a maximum penalty of a €300,000 fine and/or three years in prison. Free software advocates thus concluded that the law would have {{a chilling effect on}} the development of free software in France, since any modern desktop system is {{supposed to be able to}} <b>read</b> <b>music</b> and video content, and their designers could not be sure whether they would face felony charges.|$|E

In 1928, the three brothers, Karl (1908-1997), Jack (1911-1959), and Dan (1996-1961) Landt, with their accompanist Howard White, were signed onto the NBC Blue Network as {{sustaining}} artists and began a career of more than 20 years. They performed primarily on radio but also performed in vaudeville, including some headline runs at the Palace and Carnegie Hall, and made many personal appearances. They were unusual in the music world in that they did not <b>read</b> <b>music,</b> so they sang and played by ear. They continued to perform on radio and in advertising until the early 1950s, when the rising popularity of television ended their performance career.|$|E
25|$|Acting {{as if he}} is {{not bothered}} by Dr. Lee exiling him, Devon {{contacts}} A's rival school Morris Brown College, to discuss playing for their marching band next season. Mr. Wade, Brown's band leader, says that Devon does not {{need to know how to}} <b>read</b> <b>music</b> and will likely get a full scholarship and a good position on the drumline. When Wade wants to know what Dr. Lee is planning for the BET Big Southern Classic (a large competition of college bands), Devon realizes that his heart and honor are still with the A band. He rejects the scholarship offer from the rival band and returns to A Though Devon is still not playing for the band, he cannot give up his drumming. He is sent cassette tapes from his estranged father and gets some ideas for new drum arrangements. He and Sean have a final confrontation, with Sean telling Devon that he is A's best drummer but that the band is bigger than just one person; this clears the air and they begin to work together. The two present their idea for an entrance cadence to Dr. Lee who decides they will be used during the Classic. Devon helps the drumline prepare and patches up his relationship with Laila. Lee also tells Devon that he can guarantee him a full return to the band next year.|$|E
