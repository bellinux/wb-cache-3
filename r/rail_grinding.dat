5000|$|Preventative <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> is {{done before}} {{any signs of}} rail {{corrugation}} development. Rail corrugation will develop exponentially if {{the first signs of}} rail corrugation are not ground or serviced. Preventative grinding removes the deformation from friction and the chemical breakdown of the tracks. Regular <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> is the primary maintenance operation used to combat roaring rail or short-pitched rail corrugation. <b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> operations occur periodically in order to prevent rail corrugation from occurring. <b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> cars can be taken down freight lines that traverse long distances in the same direction if the freight railway used continually Rail corrugation, the carbon growth of the rail which is increased by friction, grows exponentially.|$|E

50|$|A railgrinder (or rail grinder) is a {{maintenance}} of way vehicle or train used {{to restore the}} profile and remove irregularities from worn rail track to extend its life and to improve the ride of trains using the track. Rail grinders were developed to increase the lifespan of the tracks being serviced for rail corrugation. <b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> {{is a process that}} is done to stop the deformation due to use and friction on railroad tracks by removing deformations and corrosion. Railroad tracks that experience continual use are more likely to experience corrugation and overall wear. Rail grinders are used to grind the tracks when rail corrugation is present, or before corrugation begins to form on the tracks. Major freight train tracks use rail grinder to maintenance based the interval of tonnage rather than time. Transit systems and subways in major cities continue to use scheduled <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> processes to combat the corrugation common to heavily used tracks. Rail-grinding equipment may be mounted on a single self-propelled vehicle or on a dedicated rail-grinding train which, when used on an extensive network, may include crew quarters. The grinding wheels, of which there may be more than 100, are set at controlled angles to restore the track to its correct profile.|$|E
50|$|Facing what {{appeared}} to be a crisis in transportation, the reports suggested several plans of action. The first was to immediately research improvements in existing systems and to disseminate those improvements as quickly as possible. The HUD had already been working in partnership with industry to improve service, for instance, HUD carried out experiments on the New York subway system to test installations of two-way radios between operator cabs and central control, which decreased train delays by 41%. Similar experiments were carried out on automated routing and scheduling, communications, <b>rail</b> <b>grinding,</b> even informational displays for passengers.|$|E

50|$|Whether a grind is back-side (BS) or front-side (FS) {{depends on}} how rider {{approaches}} the rail or edge. If the skater approaches the rail {{with his back to}} it, the grind is a back-side grind. If the skater approaches the rail with the front of his body to the <b>rail,</b> the <b>grind</b> is a front-side grind.|$|R

50|$|Rail {{corrugation}} may {{be prevented}} by selecting rails with material compositions {{that are more}} resistant to corrugation. Heat-treated alloy steel rails with relative hardness are the most resistant as opposed to Bessemer steels due to a greater relative hardness. Rails with a Brinell hardness of 320-360 are best for corrugation resistant rails. Trains may vary speed on the tracks {{in an effort to}} prevent corrugation from affecting sections or rail on a transit systems. Varying a train’s speed, direction, and tonnage are beneficial for combating the growth of rail, as corrugation is caused by continually uniform friction. On subways and major transit systems, {{it is not possible to}} vary the direction of trains, making the use of annual and bi-annual <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> processes more applicable.|$|E
50|$|On 21 January 2008, a {{maintenance}} works train which was carrying out works between Tampines and Simei (westbound) broke down, causing a disruption from 5.28 am to 12.45 pm {{on both the}} eastbound and westbound services from Pasir Ris and Tanah Merah, affecting 57,000 commuters. SMRT was fined S$387,176 (approximately US$280,000) on 10 March 2008 after the LTA's investigations concluded that the disruption was due to SMRT's working party not complying with operating procedures. This was specifically on securing the parked portion of the maintenance train, which comprised a locomotive and a wagon. The fine was the largest ever for a rail related incident in Singapore. According to operating procedures, during maintenance works, the portion comprising a locomotive and a <b>Rail</b> <b>Grinding</b> Vehicle will proceed with its works, while {{the portion of the}} maintenance train is detached and parked at a distance from the working zone. However, investigations from LTA and SMRT showed that SMRT did not apply the locomotive's parking brake. There was also no wheel chock placed to prevent movement along the gradient of the track. If SMRT had followed operating procedures, a roll-back would have been prevented.|$|E

50|$|High-speed {{grinding}} (HSG) is a rail care concept {{developed by}} the company Stahlberg Roensch from Seevetal, Germany. It {{is based on the}} principle of rotational grinding and serves to <b>grind</b> <b>rails</b> at up to 100 km/h.|$|R
40|$|On-site welding of rails is {{currently}} mainly done through manual work by skilled engineers. Fig. 1 shows photos of current grinding work. That rail welding work includes the actual rail welding along with <b>rail</b> <b>grinding.</b> <b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> is particularly hard, manual work using a stone grinder in a half-crouched position. It takes approx. 60 minutes to weld single rail, so second welding {{can be done}} only for three sets of rails a day within usual track maintenance time. Improvement of work efficiency thus has been demanded. In the light of that, we decided to develop a <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> machine for welds {{for the purpose of}} easing the work and reducing the work time of <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> work.

30|$|Moreover, a {{noticeable}} reduction of dynamic overloads after <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> has been achieved. Although {{it is observed}} that the sign and average value of the overload have remained virtually unchanged in 15 of the 16 cases after the grinding process, the amplitude of the forces of wheel–rail interaction has disappeared. Therefore, {{in the absence of any}} other pathology, <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> will allow counteracting the amplitude variation of the wheel–rail contact forces.|$|E
40|$|The Class 1 {{heavy haul}} railroads of North America are using <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> best {{practices}} to ensure maximum returns on their investment in rail to their shareholders. AREMA Committee 4, Sub Committee 9, focus group consists of <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> managers responsible for implementing <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> best practice in North America. This group {{has issued a}} survey and gathered together the most recent knowledge of <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> best practices for the AREMA manual. This will provide railways worldwide a guideline {{for the implementation of}} a preventive grinding strategy with the supporting economic justification. The most important reason for grinding in North America today is to control rail surface fatigue defects. The best way to control these defects is by preventive grinding and having in place a proper lubrication strategy. For preventive grinding to be successful a railroad must have engineered rail profiles ground onto the rail to reduce the wheel / rail contact stress. These rail profiles will significantly increase rail life, improve train stability and curving. Rail corrugations will be in control, however if they are presen...|$|E

40|$|<b>Rail</b> <b>grinding</b> {{has become}} an {{important}} maintenance activity {{over the past three}} decades and the importance of <b>rail</b> <b>grinding</b> is likely to augment owing to future demands in rail transport sector particularly for heavy haul lines. The preventive grinding strategy is preferred over the corrective grinding strategy by most rail infrastructure owners, as it can maintain the rails economically by targeting the magic wear rate. Grinding decisions on when to grind (Grinding intervals), how much to grind (Material removal) and where to grind do not have a strong economic insight in the current practice. Impact of these grinding decisions on the total rail maintenance cost is not researched extensively. This paper will discuss the various factors that influence the grinding decision.
