[...] Historian Robert Zemsky wrote of Belcher, [...] " [...] was almost a caricature of a New England Yankee: arrogant, vindictive, often impetuous despite a most solemn belief in <b>rational</b> <b>action</b> and calculated maneuver." [...] Once he acquired the governorship, he took potential assaults on his power personally, and reacted vindictively in attempts to destroy or marginalize his enemies. [...] In personal correspondence with friends, family, and supporters, he used condescending names to refer to his opponents, and he applied pressure to the press in Boston to ensure reasonably favorable coverage of him.|$|E

It only pays in certain cases, and intelligence may be shown also by discerning what they are and when it is wiser to act without thinking. [...] Philosophers, however, have very mistaken ideas about <b>rational</b> <b>action.</b> They tend to think that men ought to think all the time, and about all things. But if they did this they would get nothing done, and shorten their lives without enhancing their merriment. Also they utterly misconceive the nature of <b>rational</b> <b>action.</b> They represent it as consisting in the perpetual use of universal rules, whereas it consists rather in perceiving when a general rule must be set aside in order that conduct may be adapted to a particular case.|$|E

This leads in particular to a complete characterization of regular additive group actions on semi-affine varieties in terms of their associated vector fields.

Yet it is also commonly believed that it cannot ever be rational to believe one proposition rather than another if one lacks stronger reason to do so. This asymmetry has been taken to indicate a deep difference between epistemic and practical rationality. According to the view articulated here, the asymmetry should instead be explained by the difference between rational intentions and <b>rational</b> <b>actions.</b> Thus, it turns out, Buridan's Ass-style cases do not indicate an asymmetry between epistemic and practical rationality as such...|$|R
