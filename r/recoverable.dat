5|$|In the 1960s and 1970s, several {{measurements}} of the concentration of manganese in Roaring Brook at Scranton ranged from 0.7 to 21 milligrams per liter and {{measurements of}} the calcium concentration ranged from 0.8 to 31.2 milligrams per liter. The concentration of sodium ranged from 6 to 20 milligrams per liter in two measurements and the potassium concentration ranged from 1 to 3.5 milligrams per liter. Two {{measurements of the}} concentration of <b>recoverable</b> chromium ranged from less than 20 to 30 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> copper (in unfiltered water only) ranged from 30 to 200 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> iron (in unfiltered water only) ranged from 0 to 444,000 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> lead in the stream's unfiltered waters was found twice to be 50 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> manganese in the stream's unfiltered waters ranged from 20 to 1600 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> zinc in the stream's unfiltered waters ranged from 160 to 380 micrograms per liter. Trace amounts of nickel and silver {{have been found in}} the stream. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> zinc in the stream's unfiltered waters ranged between 100 and 70,000 micrograms per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> mercury in the stream (with unfiltered water) was once found to be less than 0.5 micrograms per liter.|$|E
5|$|Uranium {{deposits}} {{seem to be}} log-normal distributed. There is a 300-fold {{increase in}} the amount of uranium <b>recoverable</b> for each tenfold decrease in ore grade.|$|E
5|$|Although {{thallium}} is a modestly abundant {{element in}} the Earth's crust, with a concentration estimated to be about 0.7mg/kg, mostly in association with potassium-based minerals in clays, soils, and granites, thallium is not generally economically <b>recoverable</b> from these sources. The major source of thallium for practical purposes is the trace amount that is found in copper, lead, zinc, and other heavy-metal-sulfide ores.|$|E
5|$|In Kazakhstan, {{energy is}} the leading {{economic}} sector. The country holds about 4 billion tons of proven <b>recoverable</b> oil reserves and 2,000 cubic kilometers (480 cu mi) of gas. Kazakhstan is the world's 17th largest oil exporter and the world's 23rd largest natural gas exporter.|$|E
5|$|The {{concentration}} of sodium and potassium (as Na) in Spring Brook ranged from 1.4 to 3.9 milligrams per liter. The {{concentration of}} magnesium ranged from 0.90 to 1.60 milligrams per liter and the calcium concentration ranged from 7.30 to 8.80 milligrams per liter. The concentration of <b>recoverable</b> iron {{in the stream}} {{was measured to be}} 60 micrograms per liter in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut trees were destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit trees were temporarily useless, though they were in <b>recoverable</b> statuses.|$|E
5|$|The May 2007 title update and {{downloadable}} content {{were linked}} to a glitch which reset a number of players' saved games when they played the game's co-operative mode. The developers apologized for the glitch and offered a temporary workaround, however, saved games already lost to the glitch were not <b>recoverable.</b> On 16 May 2007, a further title update was released, resolving the issue, in addition to fixing issues {{with access to the}} Halo3 beta.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two kinds}} of oil shale in Estonia, both of which are {{sedimentary}} rocks laid down during the Ordovician geologic period. Graptolitic argillite is the larger resource, but, because its organic matter content is relatively low, it is not used industrially. The other one is kukersite, which has been mined for almost a hundred years and is expected to last for another 25–30years. By the end of 2012, the total kukersite resource was 4.8billion tonnes, of which up to 650million tonnes was <b>recoverable.</b> Kukersite deposits in Estonia account for 1.1% of global oil shale deposits.|$|E
5|$|Conversely {{almost any}} UAV could be piloted to crash onto a target in a suicide attack and most could be fitted with an improvised {{explosive}} warhead. However the primary {{use of a}} UAV or UCAV would be for <b>recoverable</b> flight operations carrying reconnaissance equipment and/or munitions. While many UAV designs are explicitly designed with loitering in mind, they are not optimized for a diving attack often lacking forward facing cameras, lacking in control response-speed which is unneeded in regular UAV flight, and are noisy when diving at the target potentially providing warning to the target. UAV's, being designed as multi-use platforms, often have a unit cost that is not appropriate for regular one-time expandable mission use.|$|E
5|$|Stelae {{have become}} {{threatened}} {{in modern times}} by plundering for sale on the international art market. Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact. Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport, including power saws, chisels, acid and heat. When a monument is well preserved, the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport. Even when successful, this results in damage to inscriptions {{on the sides of}} the stela. At worst, this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any <b>recoverable</b> sculpture removed for sale. Traceable fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past. When such monuments are removed from their original context, their historical meaning is lost. Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution, no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location. After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre-Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date. In the early 1970s some museums, such as that of the University of Pennsylvania, responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history, including place of origin, previous owners and an export license. Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The earlier {{of known}} records of {{commercial}} hunting of killer whales {{date to the}} 18th century in Japan. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the global whaling industry caught immense numbers of baleen and sperm whales, but largely ignored killer whales because of their limited amounts of <b>recoverable</b> oil, their smaller populations, {{and the difficulty of}} taking them. Once the stocks of larger species were depleted, killer whales were targeted by commercial whalers in the mid-20th century. Between 1954 and 1997, Japan took 1,178 killer whales (although the Ministry of the Environment claims that there had been domestic catches of about 1,600 whales between late 1940s to 1960s) and Norway took 987. Over 3,000 killer whales were taken by Soviet whalers, including an Antarctic catch of 916 in 1979–80 alone, prompting the International Whaling Commission to recommend a ban on commercial hunting of the species pending further research. (Compare with the situation on land, Commercial hunting.) Today, no country carries out a substantial hunt, although Indonesia and Greenland permit small subsistence hunts (see Aboriginal whaling). Other than commercial hunts, killer whales were hunted along Japanese coasts out of public concern for potential conflicts with fisheries. Such cases include a semi-resident male-female pair in Akashi Strait and Harimanada being killed in the Seto Inland Sea in 1957, the killing of five whales from a pod of 11 members that swam into Tokyo Bay in 1970, and a catch record in southern Taiwan in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The marble was quarried from Mt. Pentelikon {{and transported}} 19km to the acropolis of Athens. A {{persistent}} {{question has been}} whether it was carved in situ. Just below the moulding and above the tenia there is a channel 17mm high that would have served to give access to the sculptor's chisel when finishing the heads or feet on the relief; this scamillus or guide strip is the best evidence there is that the blocks were carved on the wall. Additionally, on practical grounds {{it is easier to}} move a sculptor than a sculpture, and to use a crowbar to put them into place, potentially, could have chipped the edges. No information is <b>recoverable</b> on the workshop, but estimates range from three to 80 sculptors on the basis of style, however, Jenifer Neils suggests nine, on the grounds that this would be the least number necessary to produce the work in the time given. It was finished with metal detailing and painted. No colour, however, survives, but perhaps the background was blue, judging by comparison with grave stelae and the paint remnants on the frieze of the Hephaisteion. Possibly figures held objects that were also rendered in paint such as Poseidon’s trident and the laurel in Apollo’s hand. The many drill holes found in Hera’s and Apollo's heads indicate that a gilded bronze wreath would probably have crowned the deities.|$|E
25|$|The United States Geological Survey {{uses the}} terms {{technically}} and economically <b>recoverable</b> resources when making its petroleum resource assessments. Technically <b>recoverable</b> resources represent that proportion of assessed in-place petroleum {{that may be}} <b>recoverable</b> using current recovery technology, without regard to cost. Economically <b>recoverable</b> resources are technically <b>recoverable</b> petroleum for which the costs of discovery, development, production, and transport, including a return to capital, can be recovered at a given market price.|$|E
25|$|The CZ-2A launcher, {{originally}} designed to carry the Shuguang-1 spacecraft, was first tested on November 5, 1974, carrying China’s first FSW-0 <b>recoverable</b> satellite, but failed. After some redesign work, the modified CZ-2C successfully launched the FSW-0 No.1 <b>recoverable</b> satellite (返回式卫星) into orbit on November 26, 1975.|$|E

25|$|This is {{when the}} mining company makes the {{decision}} whether to develop the mine or {{to walk away from}} the project. This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically <b>recoverable</b> portion of the deposit, the metallurgy and ore recoverability, marketability and payability of the ore concentrates, engineering concerns, milling and infrastructure costs, finance and equity requirements, and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation. The proportion of a deposit that is economically <b>recoverable</b> is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area.|$|E
25|$|A common hardwood, red oak, has {{an energy}} content (heat value) of 14.9 megajoules per {{kilogram}} (6,388 BTU per pound), and 10.4 megajoules <b>recoverable</b> if burned at 70% efficiency.|$|E
25|$|Dorgan was Chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee and {{was also}} {{senior member of the}} Senate Energy Committee. He was an early {{supporter}} of renewable energy, sponsoring measures on the production tax credit for wind energy and creating a Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS) mandate to help build a renewable fuels industry. He also persuaded the U.S. Geological Survey to conduct and release the first official estimate of <b>recoverable</b> oil in the Bakken Formation in North Dakota. That estimate concluded that there was up to 4.3 billion barrels of <b>recoverable</b> oil from the shale deposits in North Dakota.|$|E
25|$|The 1968 {{discovery}} of {{oil on the}} North Slope's Prudhoe Bay—which {{would turn out to}} have the most <b>recoverable</b> oil of any field in the United States—would change Alaska's political landscape for decades.|$|E
25|$|Natural gas was {{discovered}} accidentally in ancient China, as it {{resulted from the}} drilling for brines. The natural gas was used to boil brine to make salt. Natural gas was first used by the Chinese in about 500 BCE (possibly even 1000 BCE). They discovered a way to transport gas seeping from the ground in crude pipelines of bamboo {{to where it was}} used to boil salt water to extract the salt, in the Ziliujing District of Sichuan. The world's first industrial extraction of natural gas started at Fredonia, New York, United States, in 1825. By 2009, 66 000km³ (or 8%) had been used out of the total 850 000km³ of estimated remaining <b>recoverable</b> reserves of natural gas. Based on an estimated 2015 world consumption rate of about 3400km³ of gas per year, the total estimated remaining economically <b>recoverable</b> reserves of natural gas would last 250 years at current consumption rates. An annual increase in usage of 2–3% could result in currently <b>recoverable</b> reserves lasting significantly less, perhaps as few as 80 to 100 years.|$|E
25|$|The Yilgarn Craton may host up to 60% of the world's <b>recoverable</b> rare-earth elements, {{primarily}} in the Mount Weld Carbonatite. Smaller carbonatite occurrences at Ponton, near Laverton, and regionally within the eastern granite-gneiss and greenstone belts, may also prove economic.|$|E
25|$|Prospective {{resources}} are those quantities of petroleum estimated, as {{of a given}} date, to be potentially <b>recoverable</b> from undiscovered accumulations by application of future development projects. Prospective resources have both an associated chance of discovery and a chance of development.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of <b>recoverable</b> {{natural gas}} in the Marcellus have, and still do, vary greatly. The first {{to come forward with}} a {{substantial}} number was Pennsylvania State University geosciences professor Terry Engelder, who announced his startling calculation of natural gas in 2008.|$|E

25|$|According to IEA Indonesia was the 10th top {{natural gas}} {{producer}} in 2009: 76 billion cubics (bcm) 2.5% of world production of which 36 bcm was exported. In 2009 Indonesia was the 5th top coal producer: 263 million tonnes hard coal and 38 million tonnes brown. The majority of this, 230 Mt of hard coal, was exported. Indonesia has significant energy resources, starting with oil – it has 22 {{billion barrels of}} conventional oil and gas reserves, of which about 4 billion are <b>recoverable.</b> That's the equivalent of about10 years of oil production and 50 years of gas. It has about 8 billion barrels of oil-equivalent of coal-based methane (CBM) resources. It has 28 billion tonnes of <b>recoverable</b> coal. It has 28 gigawatts (GW) of geothermal potential.|$|E
25|$|Although before 2008 the Marcellus Shale was {{considered}} to have inconsequential natural gas potential, it is now believed to hold the largest volume of <b>recoverable</b> natural gas resource in the United States. In 2012, it was estimated to have 141 trillion cubic feet of technically <b>recoverable</b> gas by the US Energy Information Administration, and 88 trillion cubic feet by the US Geological Survey. In September 2012, the Marcellus Shale overtook the Haynesville Shale of northwest Louisiana as the leading producer of both shale gas and overall natural gas in the United States. In February 2014, Marcellus gas wells produced 14.0 billion cubic feet per day, a 42 {{percent increase over the}} year previous, and comprising 21 percent of all the dry gas produced that month in the United States.|$|E
