40|$|Specifically, {{the authors}} found that of the 7, 240, 000 school age {{children}} ages 5 - 17 in California, an estimated 504, 000 missed {{at least one day}} of school due to a dental problem in the past year. The majority of these children <b>report</b> one <b>missed</b> day of school due to a dental problem, while the remaining 40 percent <b>report</b> <b>missing</b> two or more days. In total, California children <b>report</b> <b>missing</b> an estimated 874, 000 school days due to dental problems. The ability to afford needed dental care is the key difference between those children who miss school due to a dental problem and those who do not. The authors note that frequent absences may have significant negative societal and economic consequences and suggest that policymakers consider addressing gaps in coverage and access, as well as school-based dental care, among other recommendations...|$|R

40|$|Missed {{nursing care}} {{is defined as}} any aspect of {{required}} patient care that is omitted or delayed. Previous studies of missed nursing care, as reported by nursing staff, have found evidence that inpatient unit nurse staffing levels affect the amount of missed nursing care. This study evaluated patient <b>reports</b> of <b>missed</b> nursing care (measured as missed communication, missed basic care, and missed timeliness) and relationships between missed nursing care and three inpatient unit nurse staffing measures: Registered nurse hours of care per patient day (RNHPPD), all nursing staff hours of care per patient day (NHPPD), and registered nurse (RN) skill mix. Additionally, patient related and unit related characteristics contributing to <b>reports</b> of <b>missed</b> nursing care were examined as covariates. METHODS: A secondary data analysis was conducted using survey data from 729 adult patients from 20 inpatient units in 2 acute care hospitals in the Midwest region of the United States, as well as hospital administrative data. RESULTS: Patients reported mouth care and mobilization to be the elements of nursing care most frequently omitted. The nurse staffing variables were correlated with missed timeliness but not missed communication or basic care. The timeliness of nursing care {{was found to be}} negatively associated with RNHPPD (r = -. 14, p = <. 001), NHPPD (r = -. 09, p =. 015), and RN Skill Mix (r = -. 13, p =. 0004). That is, as each of the staffing variable levels increased, <b>reports</b> of <b>missed</b> timeliness decreased. Hierarchical linear modeling found RN Skill Mix to be a predictor of patient <b>reported</b> <b>missed</b> timeliness (p =. 01). Additionally, patients who were younger, had poorer health, and who had a history of a psychiatric diagnosis <b>reported</b> more <b>missed</b> timeliness. The nurse staffing variables were not found to be predictors of patient <b>reported</b> <b>missed</b> communication or basic care. CONCLUSIONS: The {{results of this study suggest}} that the level of nurse staffing impacts the timeliness of nursing care. Having higher ratios of registered nurses to other nursing staff was particularly important, resulting in patients receiving their care more quickly...|$|R
