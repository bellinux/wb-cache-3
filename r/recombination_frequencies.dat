[...] These authors showed that <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> between rII mutants are not strictly additive. The recombination frequency from a cross of two rII mutants (a x d) is usually less than the sum of <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> for adjacent internal sub-intervals (a x b) + (b x c) + (c x d).

50|$|The {{classical}} {{concept is}} related to genetic linkage: Linkage between two loci is established by the observation of lower-than-expected <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> between them. In contrast, any loci on the same chromosome are by definition syntenic, even if their recombination frequency cannot be distinguished from unlinked loci by practical experiments. Thus, in theory, all linked loci are syntenic, but not all syntenic loci are necessarily linked. Similarly, in genomics, the genetic loci on a chromosome are syntenic regardless of whether this relationship can be established by experimental methods such as DNA sequencing/assembly, genome walking, physical localization or hap-mapping.|$|E

25|$|<b>Recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used in the {{creation}} of a genetic linkage map. <b>Recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency.</b> This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a double crossover is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a double crossover increases. As the likelihood of a double crossover increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|R

By various crosses of the many different strains exhibited deletions and point mutations, Benzer located each point mutation into a sub-region of one of the cistrons, and ordered the point mutations within that sub-region. Benzer also proposed missense and nonsense mutations from his rII studies.

In this study, we used pollenspecific fluorescent tagged lines (FTLs) to measure male meiotic <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> during the development of Arabidopsis thaliana. Interestingly, a subset of pollen grains consistently shows loss of fluorescence expression in tested lines. Using nine independent FTL intervals, the spatio-temporal dynamics of male <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> was assessed during plant development, considering both shoot type and plant age as independent parameters. In most genomic intervals assayed, male meiotic <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> is highly consistent during plant development, showing no significant change between different shoot types and during plant aging. However, in some genomic regions, such as I 1 a and I 5 a, a small but significant effect of either developmental position or plant age were observed, indicating that the meiotic CO frequency in those intervals varies during plant development. Furthermore, from an overall view of all nine genomic intervals assayed, both primary and tertiary shoots show a similar dynamics of increasing <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> during development, while secondary and lateral shoots remain highly stable.

40|$|Abstract Background HIV- 1 {{recombination}} {{between different}} subtypes {{has a major}} impact on the global epidemic. The generation of these intersubtype recombinants follows a defined set of events starting with dual infection of a host cell, heterodiploid virus production, strand transfers during reverse transcription, and then selection. In this study, <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> were measured in the C 1 -C 4 regions of the envelope gene in the presence (using a multiple cycle infection system) and absence (in vitro reverse transcription and single cycle infection systems) of selection for replication-competent virus. Ugandan subtypes A and D HIV- 1 env sequences (115 -A, 120 -A, 89 -D, 122 -D, 126 -D) were employed in all three assay systems. These subtypes co-circulate in East Africa and frequently recombine in this human population. Results Increased sequence identity between viruses or RNA templates resulted in increased <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies,</b> {{with the exception of the}} 115 -A virus or RNA template. Analyses of the recombination breakpoints and mechanistic studies revealed that the presence of a recombination hotspot in the C 3 /V 4 env region, unique to 115 -A as donor RNA, could account for the higher <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> with the 115 -A virus/template. Single-cycle infections supported proportionally less recombination than the in vitro reverse transcription assay but both systems still had significantly higher <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> than observed in the multiple-cycle virus replication system. In the multiple cycle assay, increased replicative fitness of one HIV- 1 over the other in a dual infection dramatically decreased <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> Conclusion Sequence variation at specific sites between HIV- 1 isolates can introduce unique recombination hotspots, which increase <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> and skew the general observation that decreased HIV- 1 sequence identity reduces recombination rates. These findings also suggest that the majority of intra- or intersubtype A/D HIV- 1 recombinants, generated with each round of infection, are not replication-competent and do not survive in the multiple-cycle system. Ability of one HIV- 1 isolate to outgrow the other leads to reduced co-infections, heterozygous virus production, and <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies.</b> </p...|$|E

Compared to the fast increasing genetic and genomics resources, the molecular cytogenetic researches in cucumber are still very limited, which results in directly the shortage of relation between plenty of physical sequences or genetic data and chromosome structure. We mapped twenty-three fosmids anchored by SSR markers from LG- 3, the longest linkage group, and LG- 4, the shortest linkage group on pachytene chromosomes 3 and 4, using uorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Integrated molecular cytogenetic maps of chromosomes 3 and 4 were constructed. Except for three SSR markers located on heterochromatin region, the cytological order of markers was concordant with those on the linkage maps. Distinct structural differences between chromosomes 3 and 4 were revealed by the high resolution pachytene chromosomes. The extreme difference of genetic length between LG- 3 and LG- 4 was mainly attributed to the difference of overall <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency.</b> The significant differentiation of heterochromatin contents in chromosomes 3 and 4 might have a direct correlation with <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency.</b> Meanwhile, the uneven distribution of <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> along chromosome 4 was observed, and <b>recombination</b> <b>frequency</b> of the long arm was nearly 3. 5 times {{higher than that of}} the short arm.

Analysis of the progeny of plants exposed to Cu 2 + and Ni 2 + showed that the plants had higher stress tolerance to the same heavy metal salts. The tolerance was higher in plants propagated on stress for 3 - 5 generations, which had longer roots than plants propagated on heavy metals only for 1 - 2 generations.

These linkage relationships of electrophoretically detected, protein coding loci were highly conserved among species. The loci encoding the enzymes appeared to be randomly distributed among the salmonid chromosomes. <b>Recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> were generally greater in females than in males.

Duplicate loci were never classically linked with each other, although some exhibited pseudolinkage and some showed evidence of exchanging alleles.

40|$|The major repeat {{sequence}} (MRS) {{is known}} {{to play a role}} in karyotypic variation in Candida albicans. The MRS affects karyotypic variation by expanding and contracting internal repeats, by altering the frequency of chromosome loss, and by serving as a hotspot for chromosome translocation.

We examined the frequency of mitotic recombination across an MRS of average size (∼ 50 kb) as well as the rate of recombination in a 325 -kb stretch of DNA adjacent to the MRS. Our results indicate that mitotic <b>recombination</b> <b>frequencies</b> across the MRS were not enhanced compared to the frequencies measured across the 325 -kb region adjacent to the MRS.
