50|$|<b>Rosterolone</b> (INN) (developmental {{code name}} SH-434), {{also known as}} 17α-propylmesterolone or 1α-methyl-17α-propyl-5α-androstan-17β-ol-3-one, is a steroidal {{antiandrogen}} that was first reported in 1984 and was developed for topical administration but was never marketed. It has shown some efficacy {{in the treatment of}} acne, and in animal models lacks systemic effects with topical application. <b>Rosterolone</b> is a derivative of mesterolone, which, in contrast, is an androgen and anabolic steroid.|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} AR antagonists have been {{developed}} for topical use but have not completed development and hence have never been marketed. These include the steroidal AR antagonists cortexolone 17α-propionate, cyproterone, <b>rosterolone,</b> and topterone and the nonsteroidal AR antagonists cioteronel, inocoterone acetate, RU-22930, RU-58642, and RU-58841. However, one topical AR antagonist, topilutamide (fluridil), has been introduced in a few European countries for the treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. In addition, a topical 5α-reductase inhibitor and weak estrogen, alfatradiol, has also been introduced in some European countries for the same indication, although its effectiveness is controversial. Spironolactone has been marketed in Italy {{in the form of a}} topical cream under the brand name Spiroderm for the treatment of acne and hirsutism, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer available.|$|E
