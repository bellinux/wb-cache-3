5000|$|The {{crash was}} {{investigated}} by the Indian investigation team, {{and concluded that the}} crash was caused by pilot error during its approach. According to the report published by the Indian investigative team, the probable cause was ruled as the pilots' failure to advance the throttles, even after the <b>radio</b> <b>altitude</b> call-outs of [...] "Four hundred", [...] "Three hundred" [...] and [...] "Two hundred" [...] feet, while the plane was in idle/open descent mode on short final approach. The report stated that the crew of Flight 605 wasn't aware of the situation and the danger they were facing at the time, and didn't respond immediately with the thrust lever that was on idle/open descent mode.|$|E
50|$|On 25 February 2009, Turkish Airlines Flight 1951, a Boeing 737-800 from Istanbul {{crashed on}} approach, just 1 km {{short of the}} airport's Polderbaan runway. The plane carried 128 {{passengers}} and 7 crew on board. 9 {{people were killed and}} a further 86 were injured, including six with serious injuries. Four of the dead were employees of Boeing, involved in an advanced radar deal with Turkey. An initial report from the Dutch Safety Board revealed that the left radio altimeter had failed to provide the correct height above the ground and suddenly reported -8 ft. As a result of this the autothrottle system closed the thrust levers to idle, as it is programmed to reduce thrust when below 27 ft <b>radio</b> <b>altitude.</b> This eventually resulted in a dropping airspeed that was not acted upon {{until it was too late}} to recover, and the aircraft stalled and crashed in a field.|$|E

50|$|Reaching 35,475 meters (116,387 feet) on August 22, 2009, BEAR-3 {{achieved}} the highest altitude so far for the BEAR series of launches. This balloon {{was the first}} in the series to be filled with hydrogen instead of helium. The payload contained a Trimble Lassen iQ GPS, a Byonics Micro-Trak 300 and four AAA lithium L92 batteries. A custom payload enclosure was designed in an effort to attempt to produce an ultra-lightweight payload. A payload mass of 95.8 grams was achieved, which puts it tied with the lightest payload in the Amateur <b>Radio</b> High <b>Altitude</b> Ballooning Records. This payload was recovered near Mundare, Alberta.|$|R
40|$|Using a novel technique, we achieve ~ 100 picoarcsecond {{resolution}} and set an upper bound {{of less than}} 4 km for the characteristic size of the Vela pulsar's emission region. Specifically, we analyze flux-density statistics of the Vela pulsar at 760 MHz. Because the pulsar exhibits strong diffractive scintillation, these statistics convey information about the spatial extent of the radio emission region. We measure both a characteristic size of the emission region and the emission sizes for individual pulses. Our results imply that the <b>radio</b> emission <b>altitude</b> for the Vela pulsar at this frequency is less than 340 km. Comment: 10 Pages, 4 Figures, accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a fault detection algorithm that could be used online. It consists of a combination of several Kalman filters and a sequential multi-hypotheses test. The differential equations used in the Kalman filters describe the system with several fault conditions. The test used in this application is an extension of the Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT) that decides between several hypotheses. It uses the innovations of the Kalman filters to find out, which filter fits best to the measured situation. The fault detection algorithm mentioned before is used to detect faults in the sensor system of the research aircraft of the Institut fuer Flugfuehrung of the Technische Universitaet Braunschweig. Several sensors give informations about the vertical motion of this aircraft: an inertial navigation system, the satellite navigation system GPS, the measurement of the barometric and the <b>radio</b> <b>altitude.</b> These sensor signals are coupled by a system of differential equations and therefore are analytically redundant. Several systematic faults have {{to be included in the}} differential equations used in the Kalman filters: rounding errors are estimated, time delays are approximated through Pade-approximants and the GPS position information is included by output equations with variant structure in the continuous-discrete Kalman filters. The performance of the fault detection algorithm is studied with simulated data that include bias faults, increased noise, drift and change in the dynamics of the plant. Two techniques are used to cope for a fault: extension of the state vector (Extended Kalman filter) or inclusion of a hypothetic fault in the output equations. The performance of the test is improved by an adaption algorithm. All Kalman filters are initialized with the most probable states after a decision is made. The improvement is shown using Monte-Carlo simulations. (orig.)

40|$|Traditional pulsar {{polarization}} sweep analysis {{starts from}} the point dipole rotating vector model (RVM) approximation. If augmented by a measurement of the sweep phase shift, one obtains {{an estimate of the}} emission altitude (Blaskiewicz, Cordes, & Wasserman). However, a more realistic treatment of field line sweepback and finite altitude effects shows that this estimate breaks down at modest altitude 0. 1 R_LC. Such <b>radio</b> emission <b>altitudes</b> turn out to be relevant to the young energetic and millisecond pulsars that dominate the γ-ray population. We quantify the breakdown height as a function of viewing geometry and provide simple fitting formulae that allow observers to correct RVM-based height estimates, preserving reasonable accuracy to R 0. 3 R_LC. We discuss briefly other observables that can check and improve height estimates...|$|R
25|$|A <b>radio</b> {{altimeter}} measures <b>altitude</b> {{above the}} terrain presently beneath an aircraft or spacecraft. This type of altimeter provides {{the distance between}} the plane and the ground directly below it, as opposed to a barometric altimeter which provides the distance above a pre-determined datum, usually sea level. In 1924, American engineer Lloyd Espenschied invented the radio altimeter. However, it took 14 years before Bell Labs was able to put Espenschied's device in a form that was adaptable for aircraft use.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim is to}} {{make the}} {{experimental}} investigations on the regularities of changing radio wave amplitude and frequency at transparence of the Earth's atmosphere on the satellite - satellite route. The new experimental data about change of the frequency and amplitude in the centimetric and decimetric <b>radio</b> waves, <b>altitude</b> relations of the refraction damping in the radio waves, refraction angle and refraction coefficient of the radio waves have been obtained.

40|$|We {{correct the}} {{relativistic}} phase shift method {{of determining the}} radio emission geometry from pulsar magnetospheres proposed by Gangadhara & Gupta (2001). The correction provides a method of determining <b>radio</b> emission <b>altitudes</b> which {{does not depend on}} the viewing geometry and does not require polarization measurements. We propose to apply the method to the outer edges of averaged radio pulse profiles to identify magnetic field lines associated with the edges of the pulse and, thereby, to test the geometric method based on the measurement of the pulse width at the lowest intensity level. Another relativistic method proposed by Blaskiewicz et al. (1991) is not accurate enough to serve as the test. We provide comprehensive discussion of the shortcomings of the relativistic methods. Moreover, we show that estimates of rotational distortions of the vacuum dipole based on the formula proposed by Shitov (1983) are underestimated by two orders of magnitude. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{geometrical}} {{analysis of}} the pulse-profile widths at 0. 43 and 1. 42 GHz (Arecibo) {{as well as at}} 1. 41 GHz (Effelsberg) is presented. We have measured the profile pulsewidths at the lowest possible intensity level. An empirical relationship for the pulsar <b>radio</b> emission <b>altitudes</b> is proposed. We argue that for the millisecond pulsars the emission region lies close to the polar cap, as opposed to the long period pulsars where the radiation originates few hundreds km away {{from the surface of the}} neutron star. Key words: radio pulsars: general, emission altitudes 1 INTRODUCTION The hypothesis known as "radius-to-frequency" mapping (RFM) explains the systematic increase of component separation and profile widths with decreasing frequency. This apparent frequency dependence suggests that the emission at different frequencies is emitted at different altitudes above the polar cap. Several authors discussed the concept of the RFM (Cordes 1978, Craft 1970, Phillips 1992, Kramer et al. 1996) an [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has {{recently}} reported {{the detection of}} pulsed gamma-rays from 6 young pulsars (J 0631 + 1036, J 0659 + 1414, J 0742 - 2822, J 1420 - 6048, J 1509 - 5850, and J 1718 - 3825), all exhibiting single-peaked pulse profiles (Weltevrede et al., 2010). High-quality radio polarization data are also available for 5 of these pulsars, allowing derivation of constraints on their viewing geometries. We obtain independent constraints on the viewing geometries of these pulsars by using a geometric pulsar emission code to model the Fermi LAT and radio light curves. We find fits for the magnetic inclination and observer angles alpha and zeta with typical errors of ~ 5 deg. Our results are generally consistent with those obtained by Weltevrede et al. (2010), although we do find differences in some cases. Our model may lastly provide a framework to constrain the <b>radio</b> emission <b>altitude.</b> Comment: 7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, conferenc...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} {{modification}} of the relativistic phase shift method of determining the radio emission geometry from pulsar magnetospheres proposed by Gangadhara & Gupta (2001). Our modification provides a method of determining <b>radio</b> emission <b>altitudes</b> which {{does not depend on}} the viewing geometry and does not require polarization measurements. We suggest application of the method to the outer edges of averaged radio pulse profiles to identify magnetic field lines associated with the edges of the pulse and, thereby, to test the geometric method based on the measurement of the pulse width at the lowest intensity level. We show that another relativistic method proposed by Blaskiewicz et al. (1991) provides upper limits for emission altitudes associated with the outer edges of pulse profiles. A comparison of these limits with the altitudes determined with the geometric method may be used to probe the importance of rotational distortions of magnetic field and refraction effects in the pulsar magnetosphere.
