5|$|<b>Repetitive</b> group {{selection}} {{tables for}} <b>repetitive</b> dives were modified. The first <b>repetitive</b> dive {{uses the same}} <b>repetitive</b> group selection as the U.S. Navy tables but subsequent dives use more conservative tables which place the diver in a higher <b>repetitive</b> group than the Navy tables would for the same profile. This tendency is continued for {{the third and fourth}} <b>repetitive</b> dives.|$|E
5|$|Autistic {{individuals}} can display {{many forms of}} <b>repetitive</b> or restricted behavior, which the <b>Repetitive</b> Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.|$|E
5|$|Bubbles do not redissolve {{immediately}} on recompression, {{and rates of}} gas uptake will alter from initial dive to <b>repetitive</b> dives, so <b>repetitive</b> dives must be handled differently in the mathematical model to predict safe decompression.|$|E
5|$|Multiple <b>repetitive</b> dives. The US Navy {{tables were}} {{designed}} for a single <b>repetitive</b> dive, and there were concerns {{about the safety of}} extending their use to multiple <b>repetitive</b> dives. As an attempt to address this issue, some tables were modified to reduce the allowable bottom time for <b>repetitive</b> dives.|$|E
5|$|Only the 120-minute {{tissue is}} used for {{calculation}} of residual nitrogen for <b>repetitive</b> dives. Letter groups are used to indicate the residual gas content of the 120-minute tissue. Letter groups are modified according to surface interval. A residual nitrogen time is found from the <b>repetitive</b> group and the <b>repetitive</b> dive depth {{which is to be}} added to the planned bottom time.|$|E
5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the <b>repetitive</b> group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins <b>repetitive</b> group indicates {{a percentage of the}} M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E
5|$|A surface {{interval}} {{of at least}} one hour between <b>repetitive</b> dives is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Compounding in Khmer is {{a common}} derivational process that takes two forms, {{coordinate}} compounds and <b>repetitive</b> compounds. Coordinate compounds join two unbound morphemes (independent words) of similar meaning to form a compound signifying a concept more general than either word alone. Coordinate compounds join either two nouns or two verbs. <b>Repetitive</b> compounds, {{one of the most}} productive derivational features of Khmer, use reduplication of an entire word to derive words whose meaning will depend on the class of the reduplicated word. A <b>repetitive</b> compound of a noun indicates plurality or generality while that of an adjectival verb could mean either an intensification or plurality.|$|E
5|$|People with Asperger {{syndrome}} {{can display}} behavior, interests, {{and activities that}} are restricted and <b>repetitive</b> and are sometimes abnormally intense or focused. They may stick to inflexible routines, move in stereotyped and <b>repetitive</b> ways, preoccupy themselves with parts of objects or compulsive behaviors like lining objects up to form patterns.|$|E
5|$|Punding {{in which}} {{complicated}} <b>repetitive</b> aimless stereotyped behaviors occur for many hours is another disturbance caused by anti-Parkinson medication.|$|E
5|$|<b>Repetitive</b> diving was {{accommodated}} in {{the tables}} using the slowest compartment to control surface off-gassing.|$|E
5|$|SAS macros are {{pieces of}} code or {{variables}} that are coded once and referenced to perform <b>repetitive</b> tasks.|$|E
5|$|Stereotyped behaviors: <b>Repetitive</b> movements, such as hand flapping, head rolling, or body rocking.|$|E
5|$|The PADI tables {{known as}} the PADI Recreational Dive Planner (RDP) were {{developed}} by Raymond Rogers and tested by DSAT (Diving Science And Technology, an affiliate of PADI Inc.). The M values were derived from Spencer's no-stop limits and the <b>repetitive</b> group designators {{were based on a}} 60-minute tissue compartment. This combination resulted in more conservative first dives, but less conservative <b>repetitive</b> dives.|$|E
5|$|These bubbles affect {{gas uptake}} and release on <b>repetitive</b> dives, {{resulting}} in a faster saturation on <b>repetitive</b> dives due {{to a combination of}} redissolved nitrogen from the bubbles, residual dissolved nitrogen, plus the nitrogen uptake due to the repeated exposure.|$|E
5|$|Total dive time {{is used to}} {{calculate}} <b>repetitive</b> group.|$|E
5|$|A diver {{who only}} {{breathes}} gas at atmospheric pressure when free-diving or snorkelling will not usually need to decompress {{but it is}} possible to get decompression sickness, or taravana, from <b>repetitive</b> deep free-diving with short surface intervals.|$|E
5|$|A minimum surface {{interval}} of 10 minutes was found {{necessary to ensure}} that the 120-minute compartment would have controlling effect for <b>repetitive</b> dives.|$|E
5|$|A precautionary {{decompression}} stop (safety stop) of 3 {{minutes at}} 15fsw is recommended after all dives, {{but the time}} spent at the safety stop {{is not included in}} the time used to calculate <b>repetitive</b> group.|$|E
5|$|Each tissue {{compartment}} {{is assumed}} to fully saturate/desaturate in 6 half-times. This means desaturation of the slowest (120 min) compartment takes 12 hours – hence the 12-hour surface interval before a dive is not considered <b>repetitive</b> with these tables.|$|E
5|$|Japanese {{magazine}} Famitsu {{praised the}} gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those {{not used to}} action games, with further praise going to the control scheme. Computer and Video Games, reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera. The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level of challenge. In contrast, Fitch found combat <b>repetitive,</b> criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented {{when compared to other}} similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles. Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although he noted that the normal melee combat lacked sophistication when compared to other titles available at the time. Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat <b>repetitive.</b> Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that <b>repetitive</b> enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience. Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available control scheme had advantages and drawbacks related to them. Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat <b>repetitive</b> and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.|$|E
5|$|No {{decompression}} limits {{have been}} reduced. In most cases {{this results in}} the <b>repetitive</b> group shifting one letter down, but for 50fsw it shifted 2 letters, and for 40fsw, by three letters.|$|E
5|$|No single <b>repetitive</b> or self-injurious {{behavior}} {{seems to}} be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.|$|E
5|$|Primordial lead—which {{comprises}} the isotopes lead-204, lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208—was mostly {{created as a}} result of <b>repetitive</b> neutron capture processes occurring in stars. The two main modes of capture are the s- and r-processes.|$|E
5|$|Recreational diving paper logbooks {{frequently}} {{provide a}} simple graphic {{representation of a}} dive profile for recording {{the details of a}} dive which are necessary for planning a <b>repetitive</b> dive using a specified set of dive tables.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{stops at}} 3msw (metres of seawater)(10fsw) are {{required}} for <b>repetitive</b> dives; 3 minutes is required after the second dive, 6 minutes after the third and 9 minutes after the fourth dive.|$|E
5|$|Table {{values at}} 30fsw (feet of seawater) and deeper were {{shortened}} by 1 to 4 minutes, putting divers into higher <b>repetitive</b> groups sooner.|$|E
5|$|The BSAC '88 Tables are {{published}} {{in the form of}} a booklet of four table sets giving no calculation <b>repetitive</b> diving solutions from sea level to 3000 metres altitude.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss tables use the 80 minute tissue {{compartment}} {{for control}} of <b>repetitive</b> dive calculations, which tends to be less conservative than the US Navy tables for this application.|$|E
5|$|The US Navy diving manual {{provides}} <b>repetitive</b> group designations for listed altitude changes. These {{will change}} over time with the surface interval according to the relevant table.|$|E
5|$|Tics are sudden, <b>repetitive,</b> nonrhythmic {{movements}} (motor tics) and utterances (phonic tics) {{that involve}} discrete muscle groups. Motor tics are movement-based tics, while phonic tics are involuntary sounds produced by moving air through the nose, mouth, or throat.|$|E
5|$|US Navy {{exceptional}} exposure tables use an 8 compartment Haldanean model {{developed by}} Workman, with half-times of 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 120, 160 and 240 minutes, {{and are not}} compatible {{with the rest of}} the US Navy Air tables for <b>repetitive</b> diving, although for convenience they have been appended to the standard US Navy Air tables. The tables warn that no <b>repetitive</b> diving is permitted following an exceptional exposure dive, and although the 240-minute tissue would only desaturate completely in 24 hours, there is no restriction to assuming an unsaturated diver after 12 hours.|$|E
5|$|A Southern hip hop record, Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik {{features}} live instrumentation in its hip hop {{production and}} musical elements from funk and soul genres. Wanting {{to make a}} statement about urban life as an African American in the South, OutKast wrote and recorded the album as teenagers and addressed coming of age topics with the album's songs. They also incorporated <b>repetitive</b> hooks and Southern slang in their lyrics.|$|E
5|$|A second {{effect is}} that a diver {{ascending}} to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a <b>repetitive</b> dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E
5|$|A softer {{and more}} tuneful musical call {{has been called}} the toy-trumpet call. It has been {{reported}} to foretell rainy weather. The loud bell call resembles the clinking call, and is a clear piping sound. Females and young make an insistent <b>repetitive</b> squawking when begging for food from a parent or mate, similar to the begging call of the Australian magpie, and make a gobbling sound when fed.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities of behavior, {{also called}} {{abnormalities}} of activity, include observations of specific abnormal movements, {{as well as}} more general observations of the patient's level of activity and arousal, and observations of the patient's eye contact and gait. Abnormal movements, for example choreiform, athetoid or choreoathetoid movements may indicate a neurological disorder. A tremor or dystonia may indicate a neurological condition or the side effects of antipsychotic medication. The patient may have tics (involuntary but quasi-purposeful movements or vocalizations) which may be a symptom of Tourette's syndrome. There are a range of abnormalities of movement which are typical of catatonia, such as echopraxia, catalepsy, waxy flexibility and paratonia (or gegenhalten). Stereotypies (<b>repetitive</b> purposeless movements such as rocking or head banging) or mannerisms (<b>repetitive</b> quasi-purposeful abnormal movements such as a gesture or abnormal gait) may be a feature of chronic schizophrenia or autism.|$|E
