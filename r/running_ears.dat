He began treatment in otolaryngology mainly due to <b>running</b> <b>ears.</b> However, since his condition did not improve, incision and drainage of the left jaw joint were performed after hospitalization. Later, as the patient’s condition threatened to deteriorate after pharmacological treatment at another ENT hospital, he was sent to our tertiary care hospital for treatment. His medical history included diabetes that had resulted in diabetic neuropathy.|$|E

40|$|In 1877 our Museum {{received}} a Cercopithecus {{died in the}} Zoological Garden at Rotterdam. Professor Schlegel thought {{it to be a}} new species and called it Cercopithecus signatus, but he never described it. As it {{seems to me to be}} a very good species I describe it under the name given by Schlegel. It belongs to Schlegel’s section VIII (vide Museum d’Histoire naturelle des Pays-Bas, Simiae, p. 86) : Cercopithèques à nez blanc; A: Base du triangle, formé par le champ nasal revêtu de poils blancs, tournée vers le haut. I thus compare it with the two species of this subdivision: Cercopithecus petaurista and Cercopithecus ascanias. I remember that C. petaurista is characterized by having the white color of the sides of the head interrupted by a black band running from the orbits to the sides of the neck, and by another black band <b>running</b> from <b>ear</b> to ear round the vertex (fascia nigra trans caput ab aure ad aurem, see Erxleben p. 36), C. ascanias by a black band running from the nose to the sides of the neck. C. signatus presents no trace of the mentioned black bands and by this character it is very easy to distinguish it from its congeners. Upperparts of body and of tail, underparts of body and inside of legs colored like in C. petaurista. Hind legs colored like forelegs, darker than in C. petaurista and C ascanias: underparts of tail dirty white. Hairs of sides of head grizzled (each hair ringed with white, yellowish and black), abruptly separated from the more reddish colored upperparts of the head by a black band, <b>running</b> from <b>ear</b> to ear over the orbits; it is a band exactly like that in C. petaurista, but does not continue in a black band round the vertex like in C. petaurista. Sides of the muzzle and a few hairs on the anterior part of the lower lip black. The ears seem to be somewhat larger and their inside more hairy than in the two mentioned species...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND Deflected {{nasal septum}} (DNS) is the commonest septal problem in ENT practice. The most painful and {{unpleasant}} {{part of this}} procedure is during removal of nasal pack. AIM Our study aims to compare the results of septoplasty with and without post-operative nasal packing and thereby assess the necessity of nasal packing after septoplasty in terms of patient’s comfort, effectiveness at controlling the haemorrhage. METHODOLOGY In our study, 80 patients who underwent septoplasty in our institution during the period July 2014 till April 2015 were simply randomised into two groups, 1 group received post-operative packing and for the other group of 40 patients, nasal packing was not done and their symptoms assessed and compared on post-operative day 1, after 1 week and 1 month and results were analysed. The following symptoms nasal obstruction, headache, bleeding, irritation of eyes, mouth breathing, <b>running</b> nose, <b>ear</b> ache, fullness, disturbed sleep, loss of smell or taste and crusting were assessed.

5000|$|The {{combination}} of fiador {{with either a}} frentera or a standard headstall or hanger with browband stabilizes the bosal by supporting it with multiple attachment points. However, it also limits {{the action of the}} bosal, and thus, particularly in the California tradition, is removed once the horse is comfortable under saddle. [...] On a finished horse, a bosal with a properly balanced heel knot and mecate generally does not require these additions.In the Texas tradition, where the bosal is placed low on the horse's face, as well as on very green horses in both the California vaquero and Texas traditions, the fiador is used to stabilize the bosal by attaching it to the headstall along the poll joint behind the <b>ears,</b> <b>running</b> under the jaw, and attaching to the bosal at the heel knot, along with the mecate. [...] In the California vaquero tradition, the fiador is omitted once the horse is able to work without it; in other traditions the fiador is retained.|$|R
40|$|Simon Saunders argues that, {{although}} distinct objects must be discernible, {{they need}} only be weakly discernible (Saunders 2003, 2006 a). I {{will argue that}} this combination of views is unmotivated: if there can be objects which differ only weakly, there can be objects which don’t differ at all. Objects are weakly discernible if they stand in some irreflexive relation (Quine 1976). Max Black’s two spheres are weakly discernible: each is one mile from the other, but not one mile from itself (Black 1952). As Saunders points out, some entangled fermions seem to exhibit mere weak discernibility. Two maximally entangled fermions (electrons in the singlet state, for example) are indiscernible in some straightforward respects: same mass, same charge. They are indiscernible in less straightforward respects too: neither has a determinate location or momentum, but they are indeterminate in just the same ways. What about spin? Pick any line, say that <b>running</b> between your <b>ears</b> right now. For each electron in the pair, it is indeterminate whether it is spinning clockwise or anti-clockwise around that axis. Crucially, however, it is determinate that each is spinning {{in the opposite direction}} to the other...|$|R

This problem has been addressed by manufacturers, who provide assistive listening devices that can be paired with the hearing aid.|$|R

50|$|Musselwhite mine uses a gold cyanidation and CIP (carbon in pulp) {{extraction}} process. Ore {{is extracted}} via a blast hole process and moved via {{a series of}} scoop-trams and underground dump trucks to one of 2 rockbreakers, either on the surface or at a 400 meter level. The ore then travels once through a jaw crusher and {{through a series of}} conveyor belts and countinously along a cone crusher rock sizing circuit. When the ore reaches a specific size it is transported to the mill building where the ore passes once through a rod mill and multiple times through a ball mill until the slurry is ground to approximately 10 µm. The slurry is then thickened, exposed to a cyanide treatment to extract it from the ore and into the solution, absorbed from the solution with activated carbon, rinsed off the carbon, passed through an electrowinning process and finally melted in a furnace and poured into 25 kg bars. The leftover tailings are passed though an INCO/SO2 cyanide destruction process. The remaining tailings are sent though a final thickening stage and are pumped into the tailings pond composed of approximately 85% solids and very little cyanide. Twice a year the excess water is drained off the tailings pond where it flows naturally through a series of polishing ponds and a freshwater marsh. By the time the runoff reaches the natural watershed system the cyanide content is drastically reduced and poses no environmental or safety hazard. The total recovery of this process is approximately 96%. Electrical power is proved by a 115 kV <b>running</b> from <b>Ear</b> Falls to Pickle Lake and a private line from there to the site. However due to the reasonably low voltage of a line that length the losses are quite high, the site only has access to about 19 kV, stalling further development plans such as a mine shaft. Additional power as required or {{in the event of an}} outage is provided by a series of large diesel generators on site.|$|R
5000|$|Each Apiaca {{communal}} hut {{constituted a}} settlement and {{had at least}} one chief. The title of chief was passed from father to son or, {{in the absence of an}} heir apparent, to the nearest relative. The chief was unique in that he was allowed as many as three wives, although typically his authority was exercised [...] "unobtrusively." [...] However, in times of war and in encounters with foreigners, the chief assumed great authority. This was evidenced by his distinctive ornaments, which included a large, white shell collar, a feather diadem, and a large belt of black beads and human teeth. After childbirth, a mother was confined for only one day, and children were raised in an atmosphere of love and affection. Boys were tattooed by women using thorns in a process completed at the age of 14. In this ritual, boys had a rectangle tattooed around the mouth, symbolizing that the boy could eat human flesh. Facial tattoos consisted of marks form each ear to the nose, chin, and mouth, while designs on the body displayed war and hunting accomplishments. Women were tattooed after marriage with a design consisting of a rectangle on the chin, with a band <b>running</b> to the <b>ears.</b> With the exception of the chief, the Apiaca were monogamous and married at the age of 14. Divorce was allowed, with custody of children going to the father in these cases. The dead were buried in shallow graves under their hammocks in the house, and their bones were exhumed after a year to be buried in the original grave.|$|R
60|$|It {{is not at}} all {{surprising}} that they upon whom the revolutionary deluge came should have looked with indiscriminating horror and affright on all the influences which in their view had united first to gather up, and then to release the destructive flood. The eighteenth century to men like De Maistre seemed an infamous parenthesis, mysteriously interposed between the glorious age of Bossuet and Fénelon, and that yet brighter era for faith and the Church which was still to come in the good time of Divine Providence. The philosophy of the last century, he says on more than one occasion, will form one of the most shameful epochs of the human mind: it never praised even good men except for what was bad in them. He looked upon the gods whom that century had worshipped as the direct authors of the bloodshed and ruin in which their epoch had closed. The memory of mild and humane philosophers was covered with the kind of black execration that prophets of old had hurled at Baal or Moloch; Locke and Hume, Voltaire and Rousseau, were habitually spoken of as very scourges of God. From this temper two consequences naturally flowed. In the first place, while it lasted there was no hope of an honest philosophic discussion of the great questions which divide speculative minds. Moderation and impartiality were virtues of almost superhuman difficulty for controversialists who had made up their minds that it was their opponents who had erected the guillotine, confiscated the sacred property of the church, slaughtered and banished her children, and filled the land with terror and confusion. It is hard amid the smoking ruins of the homestead to do full justice to the theoretical arguments of the supposed authors of the conflagration. Hence De Maistre, though, as has been already said, intimately acquainted with the works of his foes in the letter, was prevented by the vehemence of his antipathy to the effects which he attributed to them, from having any just critical estimate of their value and true spirit. 'I do not know one of these men,' he says of the philosophers of the eighteenth century, 'to whom the sacred title of honest man is quite suitable.' They are all wanting in probity. Their very names 'me déchirent la bouche.' To admire Voltaire is the sign of a corrupt soul; and if anybody is drawn to the works of Voltaire, then be sure that God does not love such an one. The divine anathema is written on the very face of this arch-blasphemer; on his shameless brow, in the two extinct craters still sparkling with sensuality and hate, in that frightful rictus <b>running</b> from <b>ear</b> to ear, in those lips tightened by cruel malice, like a spring ready to fly back and launch forth blasphemy and sarcasm; he plunges into the mud, rolls in it, drinks of it; he surrenders his imagination to the enthusiasm of hell, which lends him all its forces; Paris crowned him, Sodom would have banished him.[3] Locke, again, did not understand himself. His distinguishing characteristics are feebleness and precipitancy of judgment. Vagueness and irresolution reign in his expressions as they do in his thoughts. He constantly exhibits that most decisive sign of mediocrity--he passes close by the greatest questions without perceiving them. In the study of philosophy, contempt for Locke is the beginning of knowledge.[4] Condillac was even more vigilantly than anybody else on his guard against his own conscience. But Hume was perhaps the most dangerous and the most guilty of all those mournful writers who will for ever accuse the last century before posterity--the one who employed the most talent with the most coolness to do most harm.[5] To Bacon De Maistre paid the compliment of composing a long refutation of his main ideas, in which Bacon's blindness, presumption, profanity, and scientific charlatanry are denounced in vehement and almost coarse terms, and treated as the natural outcome of a low morality.|$|R

Well, because you always seem to me to want to take advantage. I did n't say a base advantage; I did n't accuse you of anything dreadful. I 'm sure I want to take advantage, too--I take it whenever I can. You see I take advantage of your being here--I 've got so many things to say. I have n't spoken a word in three days, and I 'm sure it is a pleasant change--a gentleman's visit. All of a sudden we have gone into mourning; I 'm sure I don't know who 's dead. Is it Mr. Gordon Wright? It 's some idea of Mrs. Vivian's--I 'm sure it is n't mine. She thinks we have been often enough to the Kursaal. I don't know whether she thinks it 's wicked, or what. If it 's wicked the harm 's already done; I can't be any worse than I am now. I have seen all the improper people and I have learnt all their names; Captain Lovelock has told me their names, plenty of times.

We have n't been to the Kursaal for four days--we have only gone out for a drive. We have taken the most interminable drives. I do believe we have seen every old ruin in the whole country. Mrs. Vivian and Angela are so awfully fond of scenery--they talk about it by the half-hour. They talk about the mountains and trees as if they were people they knew--as if they were gentlemen! I mean as if the mountains and trees were gentlemen. Of course scenery 's lovely, but you can't walk about with a tree. At any rate, that has been all our society--foliage! Foliage and women; but I suppose women are a sort of foliage. They are always rustling about and dropping off. That 's why I could n't make up my mind to go out with them this afternoon. They 've gone to see the Waterworths--the Waterworths arrived yesterday and are staying at some hotel. Five daughters--all unmarried! I don't know what kind of foliage they are; some peculiar kind--they don't drop off. I thought I had had about enough ladies' society--three women all sticking together! I don't think it 's good for a young girl to have nothing but ladies' society--it 's so awfully limited. I suppose I ought to stand up for my own sex and tell you that when we are alone together we want for nothing. But we want for everything, as it happens! Women's talk is limited--every one knows that. That 's just what mamma did n't want when she asked Mrs. Vivian to take charge of me. Now, Mr. Longueville, what are you laughing at?--you are always laughing at me. She wanted me to be unlimited--is that what you say? Well, she {{did n't want me to}} be narrowed down; she wanted me to have plenty of conversation. She wanted me to be fitted for society--that 's what mamma wanted. She wanted me to have ease of manner; she thinks that if you don't acquire it when you are young you never have it at all. She was so happy to think I should come to Baden; but she would n't approve of the life I 've been leading the last four days. That 's no way to acquire ease of manner--sitting all day in a small parlor with two persons of one's own sex! Of course Mrs. Vivian's influence--that 's the great thing. Mamma said it was like the odor of a flower. But you don't want to keep smelling a flower all day, even the sweetest; that 's the shortest way to get a headache. Apropos of flowers, do you happen to have heard whether Captain Lovelock is alive or dead? Do I call him a flower? No; I call him a flower-pot. He always has some fine young plant in his button-hole.
