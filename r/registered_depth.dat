For example, body-based trackers (such as hand controllers, joysticks or helmet attachments) restrict spontaneity and naturalness of motion, whereas groundbased devices (e. g., hand controllers) limit the workspace by literally binding an operator to the ground.

After judging the depth values and removing the poor ones we use common lines of sight to identify depth values in consecutive depth images which refer to the same 3 D-point.

This paper aims to improve a real-time hand gesture interaction system by augmenting it with a ToF camera. First, the ToF camera and the RGB camera are calibrated, and a mapping is made from the depth data to the RGB image. Then, a novel hand detection algorithm is introduced based on depth and color. This not only improves detection rates, but also allows for the hand to overlap with the face, or with hands from other persons in the background. The hand detection algorithm is evaluated in these settings, and compared to previous algorithms. Furthermore, the depth information allows us to track the position of the hand in 3 D, allowing for more interesting modes of interaction. Finally, the hand gesture recognition algorithm is applied to the depth data as well, and compared to the recognition based on the RGB images. The result is a real-time hand gesture interaction system that allows for complex 3 D gestures and is not disturbed by objects or persons in the background. 1...|$|R

Embedded security devices like ‘Trusted Platforms' require both scalability (of power, performance and area) and flexibility (of software and countermeasures). This thesis illustrates how data parallel techniques can be used to implement scalable architectures for cryptography. Vector processing is used to provide high performance, power efficient and scalable processors. A programmable vector 4 -stage pipelined co-processor, controlled by a scalar MIPS compatible processor, is described. The instruction set of the co-processor is defined for cryptographic algorithms like AES and Montgomery modular multiplication for RSA and ECC. The instructions are assessed using an instruction set simulator based on the ArchC tool. This instruction set simulator is used to see the impact of varying the vector <b>register</b> <b>depth</b> (p) and the number of vector processing units (r). Simulations indicate that for vector versions of AES, RSA and ECC the performance improves in O(log(r)). A cycle-accurate synthesisable Verilog model of the system (VeMICry) is implemented in TSMC's 90 nm technology and used to show that the best area/power/performance trade-off is reached for r = p. Also, this highly scalable design allows area/power/performance trade-offs to be made for a panorama of applications ranging from smart-cards to servers.

This indicates that a crack observed by AFM appeared after the terraces were formed, i.e., at the termination of structure’s growth. However, one cannot exclude the presence of cracks that are formed in the lower layers of the SL structure that were overgrown by the next layers. Indeed, as seen in Figure 3 c, there are no clearly observable coherent terraces within the regions of extremely high density cracks. Growing top layer stops at edges of crack forming small banks. Thus, we can suppose that cracks of this kind were formed during the growth process, and the film subsequently grows between them. Within statistical error, the density of pinholes is the same in areas between both types of cracks. Equal density of dislocations (pinholes) indicates near-the-same deformation level for each region of growing structure. Due to the finite size of the AFM tip, {{it is impossible to}} measure the depth of the cracks. The largest <b>registered</b> <b>depth</b> is about 45 [*]nm (see profile on Figure 3 c)., as we showed above (Figure 2), a compressive strain is localized in the SL/cap interface (GaN cap layer is under compression), and the cracking could be provoked by the tensile deformation only. This kind of deformation is accumulated in the SL layers, and the cracks we observed most likely originated there and propagate along with the structure to the top. The possible mechanism of the SL-cap cracking is suggested below.|$|E
40|$|The life {{expectancy}} of humans increases due to better medical care, food quality and personal hygiene. The demand for domestic robots performing (simple) household chores will increase as consequence to this trend. An important task of these robots is recognizing objects within an environment. Object models are constructed using multiple views from various viewpoints {{in order to increase}} the recognition robustness and reduce the influence of noise such as variation in illumination. The objective of this thesis is the construction of a novel viewpoint dependent model for multi-view object recognition. A benchmark is created in order to evaluate novel object recognition models for multi-view object recognition. The acquisition of object data is replaced by a scientific captured object dataset, which reduces the influence of external noise (i. e. illumination) and unequal view distributions. Edges, corners, shape, color and texture features are extracted, which describe the object data mathematically. Artificial noise is added for the construction of query objects, which are classified via the Euclidean distance measure. Based on sequence alignment, a novel viewpoint dependent object model is proposed and evaluated. Each view in a viewpoint dependent object is represented by a single value based on the location of that view in a kd-tree. The proposed sequence alignment algorithm matches objects via the optimal alignment of view sequences. The benchmark results show that multi-view sequence alignment has a higher object recognition rate compared to single-view object recognition. Novel object data is captured by moving a hand held Kinect camera around an object. A visual odometry method is implemented, which estimates the camera egomotion from <b>registered</b> <b>depth</b> and color. The ground plane is extracted from the depth data for the initial camera alignment and object segmentation. A viewpoint dependent object is constructed from the estimated egomotion and segmented object data. For object recognition each object is captured twice, where object variation occurs by changes in lighting and unequal distributed views. The scientific object datasets are replaced by the novel captured object datasets for evaluation of the object recognition performance. The benchmark results show an increased object recognition rate for the sequence alignment algorithm, despite the influence of external noise factors.

The final step of “capturing ” the new image is implemented with a ray-tracing based algorithm.

30|$|Of {{the eight}} taxonomic groups identified, Copepoda, Mysidacea, and Cladocera {{were the most}} significant. Copepods {{represented}} {{a large percentage of}} the total biomass, but production calculated with the Huntley and Lopez (1992) model was lower than expected, possibly due to the large mesh size used (335  μm). Production rates revealed the influence of diel vertical patterns, with higher values being <b>registered</b> in <b>depth</b> at nocturnal periods. The Mondego estuary did not display the typical seasonal patterns of high zooplankton biomass in summer and low in winter, common to similar sites (Fernández de Puelles et al. 2003, Rawlinson et al. 2005). Nonetheless, in the western Mediterranean basin, the range of zooplankton biomass and occurrence is not always well defined, and comparisons between data of other systems should be done carefully due to the great variety of sampling methods. Tidal exchange also revealed a non-significant variation, with little difference between imported and exported biomass and production. This is not uncommon, and studies in other locations have yielded equivocal results with different explanations, as discussed by Melo Júnior et al. (2007). In a shallow coastal ecosystem like the Mondego estuary, the influence of river discharge and varying salinity levels are significant, and it is possible to conclude that local factors such as freshwater flow, predation, and food limitation may regulate the seasonal variations in biomass and production. This study represents the first attempt at estimating biomass and secondary production of the zooplankton community of the Mondego estuary. It would be important to conduct future studies with smaller mesh size nets in order to estimate the contribution of smaller sized zooplankton, as well as to define a copepod growth model specific to this ecosystem for achieving more accurate production estimates.|$|R

A field experiment was established in spring of 2013 on a loamy soil. The experiment compared four tillage methods (zero tillage, ZT; reservoir tillage, RT; minimum tillage, MT; and conventional tillage, CT). Soil bulk density and soil cone index were measured during maize growing season and at harvesting time.

We tested the hypothesis that differences in food availability can result in habitat partitioning along a depth gradient. The abundance and size of M. glacialis was <b>registered</b> at 4 <b>depth</b> strata: 0 - 4 m, 4 - 8 m, 8 - 12 m, and > 12 m; we also recorded the number of food items that they were preying on. The abundance and size of M. glacialis decreased with depth. Mussels (Mytilus galloprivincialis) were the most preyed food item across all depth strata, followed by gastropods, sea urchins and barnacles; M. glacialis also consumed a significantly larger amount of mussels in feeding experiments compared with sea urchins and gastropods. The abundance of M. galloprivincialis beds decreased with depth. The clear link between the decrease in abundance and size of M. glacialis with depth and the decay of the most consumed prey (mussels) suggest that food availability may {{play an important role in}} the vertical distribution of this starfish, though wave-associated turbulence in the first few metres of the subtidal could also limit the abundance of M. glacialis...|$|R
40|$|New {{depth camera}} {{technology}} has {{potential to make}} {{a significant impact on}} computer systems interaction with 3 D objects; yet, it is currently limited due to its poor noise and resolution characteristics. In this thesis we propose to use depth camera’s strongest characteristic, its video rate capture speeds, to overcome these limitations. Previous work to utilize sequences of depth images used 2 D super-resolution techniques to combine chunks of depth images that are close in time in order to increase the resolution and noise characteristic. This technique took advantage of the consistency of the scene with respect to small changes in viewpoint. But, while increasing the resolution and decreasing unbiased noise, this algorithm increased biased noise. Thus, we are motivated to consider an algorithm that can first <b>register</b> all <b>depth</b> images to a common 3 D coordinate system and then utilize a 3 D superresolution technique, known as surface reconstruction, to increase the resolution and decrease both biased and unbiased noise. This thesis considers {{the first part of this}} problem, which is the registration of a sequence of depth images to a common coordinate frame. Previous registration methods were developed for high resolution, low noise point clouds and perform poorly for noisy sequences of depth data. Thus, from our analysis of ideal signed distance functions, we propose a new method for finding the closest point to the surface given a signed distance function and its gradient. Utilizing Implicit Moving Least Squares (IMLS) and our analysis, we propose a new algorithm that computes the registration of a set of points to the surface defined by the IMLS function of another set of points. We also propose a grid based implementation that allows for bounded computations per time step. Our results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is more robust in the presence of realistic depth noise. ii To my Lord Jesus Christ and my wife Sand...|$|R
