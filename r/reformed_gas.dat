The fuels in the four combustion processes were liquid fuel, liquid fuel + steam, liquid fuel + <b>reformed</b> <b>gas</b> and <b>reformed</b> <b>gas,</b> respectively. The mathematical models adopted for different fuels combustion consist of realizable k−ε turbulence model and probability density function (PDF) model. The temperature distribution, species concentrations and NO emission were obtained. The {{results show that the}} fuels can burn effectively in the dual-fuel combustor for CRGT. Compared with the liquid fuel combustor, the flame temperature, average temperature of combustor wall and NO emission are reduced by 7, 8 %, 4, 8 % and 75, 3 % respectively when the steam is injected into the combustor. However, they are reduced more when the liquid fuel is replaced by <b>reformed</b> <b>gas,</b> which are 10, 3 %, 5, 6 % and 97, 2 % respectively. A little deterioration of the overall temperature distribution of combustor outlet is obtained for liquid fuel + steam combustor, while a better temperature distribution of combustor outlet is obtained for <b>reformed</b> <b>gas</b> combustor, i...|$|E
40|$|A microgrid, {{with little}} {{environmental}} impact, is developed by introducing a combined SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) and PEFC (proton exchange membrane fuel cell) system. Although the SOFC requires a higher operation temperature {{compared to the}} PEFC, the power generation efficiency of the SOFC is higher. However, if high temperature exhaust heat may be used effectively, a system with higher total power generation efficiency can be built. Therefore, this paper investigates the operation of a SOFC–PEFC combined system, with time shift operation of <b>reformed</b> <b>gas,</b> into a microgrid with 30 houses in Sapporo, Japan. The SOFC is designed to correspond to base load operation, and the exhaust heat of the SOFC is used for production of <b>reformed</b> <b>gas.</b> This <b>reformed</b> <b>gas</b> {{is used for the}} production of electricity for the PEFC, corresponding to fluctuation load of the next day.

Supplying steam into the reformer to suppress carbon particulate formation for PE pyrolysis gas is more effective than for wood chips pyrolysis gas.

A CFD-based 3 D model with mass and momentum transport and temperature characteristics is established.

Furthermore, Cu-based micro reformers of both cross-U and parallel-U type reactors are designed, fabricated and tested for experimental validation. Under the same condition for reforming and combustion, the results demonstrate that higher methanol conversion is achievable in cross-U type reactor.

We assess the theoretical costs and benefits of ownership unbundling and judge these to be generally positive, though these may be potentially offset by the actual reorganisation costs of the ownership unbundling process. Next, we assess the empirical evidence. This is in two forms – econometric evidence from samples of countries and case studies of reforms in particular jurisdictions. The econometric evidence is weak due to problems with simultaneity of reform steps and a lack of studies, but the case study evidence is compelling. We conclude with a discussion of of the issues faced by countries considering implementing ownership unbundling.
