In order to accommodate the intended uses of prothioconazole, France proposed to raise the existing MRLs from the value of 0. 1 mg/kg for rape seed and 0. 05 mg/kg for the other three oilseeds to 0. 15 mg/kg for these four oilseeds. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA the data are sufficient to derive MRL proposals of 0. 15 mg/kg for the proposed uses on oilseed rape, linseed, poppy and mustard. However a data gap is identified for the stability of residues included in the plant risk assessment <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> (other than <b>prothioconazole-desthio)</b> in plant samples, stored frozen, to be demonstrated. Adequate analytical enforcement methods are available to control the residues of prothioconazole in plant matrices at the validated LOQ of 0. 02 mg/kg for prothioconazole-desthio as sum of isomers. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the proposed use of prothioconazole on oilseed rape, linseed, poppy and mustard will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore is unlikely to pose a consumer health risk...|$|R
40|$|EFSA {{has asked}} the Panel on Plant Protection Products and their Residues to prepare {{guidance}} on {{the establishment of the}} <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> for dietary risk assessment. The <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> for risk assessment is used by risk assessors to evaluate the potential risk of dietary intake of residues resulting from the application of a pesticide. This document guides the complex process of identifying the pertinent residue components that should be considered for dietary risk assessments of chemical active substances. Specifically, the document provides directions for determining the metabolites that require hazard identification and characterisation using scientific tools and methods ((quantitative) structure-activity relationship ((Q) SAR), read-across, threshold of toxicological concern (TTC)) and available data in combination, and for developing an appropriate testing strategy for these compounds. Further, for activities within the remit of the guidance document the terms 'potency' and 'toxicological burden' for consumers are defined and decision criteria established for the selection of the residue components that {{should be included in the}} <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> for dietary risk assessment. In order to support the decision process it is recommended to make use of all information available, including mechanistic understanding, and to present detailed information on toxicity and exposure for every single metabolite and on the uncertainties connected to the proposed <b>residue</b> <b>definition.</b> The guidance document is complemented with three practical case studies demonstrating the applicability of the proposed decision scheme...|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France received an application {{to modify the}} existing MRLs for captan in pome fruits and in commodities of animal origin. In order to accommodate the intended use, France proposed raising the existing MRLs for pome fruit, ruminant tissues and milk. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal for the SEU and the NEU use on pome fruit, according to the <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> “sum of captan and THPI, expressed as captan” and for the <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> “sum of captan and folpet”. The nature of captan residues in livestock is sufficiently elucidated and EFSA proposes to modify the existing <b>residue</b> <b>definitions</b> in animal commodities according to the conclusions of the peer review. The results of the feeding study indicate {{that in order to}} accommodate the SEU use of captan on pome fruit, the MRLs for ruminant meat, liver and kidney would have to be amended. For the less critical NEU use on pome fruit, MRLs at the LOQ are sufficient for commodities of animal origin. Based on the results of the consumer risk assessment EFSA concludes that the NEU use of captan on pome fruit and resulting residues in commodities of animal origin will not pose a public health concern. No consumer health risk was identified also for the MRL proposals derived for the more critical SEU use. However, in case apples and pears contain residues {{at the level of the}} MRL proposal for the SEU use, the safety margin for acute exposure was found to be very narrow.

We argue that specific aspects of the history, chemistry and safety of glyphosate and glyphosate-based herbicides should be thoroughly considered in present and future re-evaluations of these dominant agrochemicals: • Glyphosate {{is not a single}} chemical, it is a family of compounds with different chemical, physical, and toxicological properties. • Glyphosate is increasingly recognized as having more profound toxicological effects than assumed from previous assessments. • Global use of glyphosate is continuously increasing and residues are detected in food, feed, and drinking water. Thus, consumers are increasingly exposed to higher levels of glyphosate residues, and from an increasing number of sources. • Glyphosate regulation is predominantly still based on primary safety-assessment testing in various indicator organisms. However, archive studies indicate fraud and misbehavior committed by the commercial laboratories providing such research. We see emerging evidences from studies in test-animals, ecosystems indicators and studies in human health, which justify stricter regulatory measures. This implies revising glyphosate <b>residue</b> <b>definitions</b> and lowering Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) permissible in biological material intended for food and feed, as well as strengthening environmental criteria such as accepted residue concentrations in surface waters.

The EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for aminopyralid in ruminant meat, fat, liver, kidney and milk. The metabolism of aminopyralid has been elucidated in lactating goats and poultry. Parent aminopyralid is proposed as <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> for enforcement and risk assessment for all products of animal origin. The residue levels in the imported {{food of animal origin}} should reflect livestock exposure from the intake of all feed crops treated with aminopyralid in the country of origin. Since EFSA does not have a comprehensive overview of the feeding practices and the aminopyralid residues in feed available in these countries, it is more appropriate to calculate the dietary burden on an international level, using internationally agreed methodologies. Thus, livestock dietary burden calculated by the JMPR was used to estimate the potential carry-over of residues into food of animal origin. Data from feeding studies indicate that the existing EU MRLs have to be raised for ruminant meat, fat, kidney and liver. For milk, eggs, poultry and swine products no modification of the existing EU MRLs is required.

40|$|Abstract. Jeffrey and Kirwan [14] gave {{expressions}} for intersection pairings on {{the reduced}} space µ − 1 (0) /G {{of a particular}} Hamiltonian G-space M in terms of iterated <b>residues.</b> The <b>definition</b> of quasi-Hamiltonian spaces was introduced in [1]. In [2] a localization formula for equivariant de Rham cohomology of a compact quasi-Hamiltonian G-space was proved. In this paper we prove a residue formula for intersection pairings of reduced spaces of quasi-Hamiltonian G-spaces, by constructing a corresponding Hamiltonian G-space. Up to overall normalizing constants and a difference that disappears for topologically trivial torus bundles (and which we conjecture will disappear in general – see Section 6), our result agrees with that in [2]. In this article we rely heavily on the methods of [14]; for the more general class of compact Lie groups G treated in [2], we rely on results of Szenes and Brion-Vergne concerning diagonal bases. 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{illustrate}} {{the potential of}} liquid chromatography with (quadrupole) time-of-flight mass spectrometry [LC-(Q) TOF-MS] in investigating the presence of pesticide metabolites in food and water samples. The higher polarity of metabolites compared to their parent pesticides makes the combination of LC [both high-performance (HPLC) and ultra-performance (UPLC) ] with TOF-MS {{one of the most}} appropriate techniques for their analysis, mainly from a qualitative point of view. Both target analysis and non-target analysis have been explored making use of this technique. Target analysis is typically applied in the inspection of maximum residue limits in food, when a relevant metabolite is included in the <b>residue</b> <b>definition</b> for toxicological reasons or its presence in significant amounts. Within this field, LC-TOF-MS, thanks to its intrinsic characteristics of high sensitivity in full-scan acquisition mode and elevated mass accuracy, has great potential for qualitative purposes, and it allows detection and reliable identification {{of a large number of}} metabolites in only one chromatographic run without the need for re-analysis. The latest generations of TOF instruments have also been successfully applied for quantitative purposes. By contrast with food analysis, for drinking water, most regulations of residues do not specify which pesticide metabolites must be included in analysis, and even less so for environmental waters. In such cases, analytical laboratories can focus analysis on a list of (normally) a few target metabolites, or on non-target analysis, where the objective is to identify (pre-defined) metabolites in samples without previously selecting them. We review the use of LC-TOF-MS and LC-(Q) TOF-MS in pesticide-metabolite analysis, considering different approaches:*multi-residue pesticide analysis, where several metabolites are included within the list of target analytes;*investigation of pesticide metabolites in samples that were positive for selected pesticides in previous target analysis;*investigation of metabolites in pesticide-metabolism or degradation studies, typically in laboratory or field experiments under controlled conditions; and,*non-target analysis, where there is no previous information or restrictions on the compounds to be searched in the samples. We show that LC-(Q) TOF-MS is at present one of the most advanced and efficient techniques for screening and identification of pesticide metabolites in food and water. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Tropical fruits {{are being}} {{increasingly}} consumed {{around the world}} because of their appreciated characteristics, particularly their high nutritional value and distinctive taste, which {{are different from those}} of traditional fruits. Owing to their introduction into international markets it is necessary to have a reliable analytical methodology available for the sensitive determination of pesticide residues in order to monitor the compliance of maximum residue limits (MRLs). From an analytical point of view, tropical fruits have generally been far less studied than other fruits frequently consumed in the European Union or USA, which are among the most important markets. In this work, LC–MS/MS-based methodology using a triple quadrupole analyzer was developed for the multi-residue determination of selected pesticides and metabolites in tropical fruits, which were selected among the most popular in Colombia, {{one of the most important}} suppliers of tropical fruits around the world. After selection of a QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged, and Safe) -based sample treatment, the study focused on the evaluation of matrix effects, in order to find a simple way for their correction. Twelve different food matrices were selected to perform this study: the seven Colombian tropical fruits of highest value for domestic and international markets (uchuva, tamarillo, granadilla, gulupa, maracuya, papaya, and pithaya), and five more matrices highly consumed in Colombia (lulo, carambolo, feijoa, mangostan, and guayaba). Twenty compounds, including pesticides widely applied in tropical fruits pest control and several metabolites considered in <b>residue</b> <b>definition,</b> were used as model compounds in this work. Correction factors were used on the basis of calibration graphs obtained with standards in solvent and in matrix, and their usefulness was supported by validation of the method in all the matrices tested at 0. 01 and 0. 1 mg/kg. The analysis of real-world samples revealed the presence of several target compounds that were identified by the acquisition of two MS/MS transitions, and by ion intensity ratio and retention time agreement.

In particular, we prove that the pole <b>residues</b> and associated <b>definitions</b> of branching ratios and partial widths are gauge independent to all orders. A simpler, previously discussed definition of branching ratios and partial widths is found to be gauge independent through next-to-next-to-leading order. It is then explained how it may be modified in order to extend the gauge independence to all orders. We also show that the physical scattering amplitude is the most general combination of self-energy, vertex, and box contributions that is gauge independent for arbitrary s, discuss the analytical {{properties of}} the NI functions, and exhibit explicitly their one-loop expressions in the Z-#gamma# sector of the Standard Model.

40|$|International audienceThe EU Maximum <b>Residue</b> Limit (MRL) <b>definition</b> for amitraz is 'the sum of amitraz plus all its {{metabolites}} {{containing the}} 2, 4 aniline moiety, expressed as amitraz'. A rapid and sensitive method {{has been developed}} and validated in-house for the determination of total amitraz in pears, strawberries, oranges and honey. Samples were hydrolysed (under acidic followed by alkaline conditions) to convert amitraz to 2, 4 -dimethyaniline which was then partitioned into 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane prior to quantification by GC-MS. The method was validated at 0. 02 and 0. 1 mg kg- 1 amitraz (well below MRL requirements) with a lowest calibrated level (LCL) for 2, 4 -dimethylaniline of 0. 002 mg kg- 1 (equivalent to 0. 0024 mg kg- 1 amitraz). A single partition step yielded recoveries of approximately 60 % (with % CV's in the range 3. 3 - 8. 2), which is satisfactory for screening purposes. A second partition increased recoveries by 10 - 20 % making the method suitable for the quantification of residues. </sup...|$|R
40|$|Radiation {{damage is}} an {{inherent}} problem in x-ray crystallography. It usually {{is presumed to}} be nonspecific and manifested as a gradual decay in {{the overall quality of}} data obtained for a given crystal as data collection proceeds. Based on third-generation synchrotron x-ray data, collected at cryogenic temperatures, we show for the enzymes Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase and hen egg white lysozyme that synchrotron radiation also can cause highly specific damage. Disulfide bridges break, and carboxyl groups of acidic <b>residues</b> lose their <b>definition.</b> Highly exposed carboxyls, and those in the active site of both enzymes, appear particularly susceptible. The catalytic triad residue, His- 440, in acetylcholinesterase, also appears to be much more sensitive to radiation damage than other histidine residues. Our findings have direct practical implications for routine x-ray data collection at high-energy synchrotron sources. Furthermore, they provide a direct approach for studying the radiation chemistry of proteins and nucleic acids at a detailed, structural level and also may yield information concerning putative “weak links” in a given biological macromolecule, which may be of structural and functional significance...|$|R
40|$|Cannabis sativa L. is a prolific, but not exclusive, {{producer}} of {{a diverse group}} of isoprenylated resorcinyl polyketides collectively known as phytocannabinoids. The modular nature of the pathways that merge into the phytocannabinoid chemotype translates in differences {{in the nature of the}} resorcinyl side-chain and the degree of oligomerization of the isoprenyl <b>residue,</b> making the <b>definition</b> of phytocannabinoid elusive from a structural standpoint. A biogenetic definition is therefore proposed, splitting the phytocannabinoid chemotype into an alkyl- and a b-aralklyl version, and discussing the relationships between phytocannabinoids from different sources (higher plants, liverworts, fungi). The startling diversity of cannabis phytocannabinoids might be, at least in part, the result of non-enzymatic transformations induced by heat, light, and atmospheric oxygen on a limited set of major constituents (CBG, CBD, D 9 -THC and CBC and their corresponding acidic versions), whose degradation is detailed to emphasize this possibility. The diversity of metabotropic (cannabinoid receptors), ionotropic (thermos-TRPs), and transcription factors (PPARs) targeted by phytocannabinoids is discussed. The integrated inventory of these compounds and their biological macromolecular end-points highlights the opportunities that phytocannabinoids offer to access desirable drug-like space beyond the one associated to the narcotic target CB 1...|$|R

The problem we are concerned with in our lectures and which we shall refer to as the lifting problem was originally formulated by Frans Oort in [1]. To state it, we fix an algebraically closed field κ of positive characteristic p. Let W (κ) be the ring of Witt vectors over κ.

40|$|Abstract Background Effective {{encoding}} of residue {{contact information}} {{is crucial for}} protein structure prediction since it has a unique role to capture long-range residue interactions compared to other commonly used scoring terms. The residue contact information can be incorporated in structure prediction in several different ways: It can be incorporated as statistical potentials {{or it can be}} also used as constraints in ab initio structure prediction. To seek the most effective <b>definition</b> of <b>residue</b> contacts for template-based protein structure prediction, we evaluated 45 different contact definitions, varying bases of contacts and distance cutoffs, in terms of their ability to identify proteins of the same fold. Results We found that overall the residue contact pattern can distinguish protein folds best when contacts are defined for residue pairs whose Cβ atoms are at 7. 0 Å or closer to each other. Lower fold recognition accuracy was observed when inaccurate threading alignments were used to identify common residue contacts between protein pairs. In the case of threading, alignment accuracy strongly influences the fraction of common contacts identified among proteins of the same fold, which eventually affects the fold recognition accuracy. The largest deterioration of the fold recognition was observed for β-class proteins when the threading methods were used because the average alignment accuracy was worst for this fold class. When results of fold recognition were examined for individual proteins, we found that the effective contact definition depends on the fold of the proteins. A larger distance cutoff is often advantageous for capturing spatial arrangement of the secondary structures which are not physically in contact. For capturing contacts between neighboring β strands, considering the distance between Cα atoms is better than the Cβ−based distance because the side-chain of interacting residues on β strands sometimes point to opposite directions. Conclusion Residue contacts defined by Cβ−Cβ distance of 7. 0 Å work best overall among tested to identify proteins of the same fold. We also found that effective contact definitions differ from fold to fold, suggesting that using different <b>residue</b> contact <b>definition</b> specific for each template will lead to improvement of the performance of threading. </p...|$|R
