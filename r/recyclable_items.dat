50|$|Three major {{methods are}} used in ukulhas for the disposal; such as recycling, {{pyrolysis}} and Composting. Aluminium items such as beverage cans, copper such as wires, steel and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, polyethylene and PET bottles, Glass bottles and jars etc. are separated. <b>Recyclable</b> <b>items</b> are sold {{once or twice a}} month. For the pyrolysis, plant items, wooden materials, card boards, magazines, light paper, etc. are placed on a decomposition chamber which is burned into charcoal and ash. For the composting, organic matters are decomposed and recycled as a fertilizer. It is a key ingredient for organic farming. For decompose organic matters such as leaves, ‘green’ food wastes are wetted make a heap and keep those heaps for a week or months to break down into humus. After the breaking down into humus, composed fertilizers are packed and labelled for the sale.|$|E

40|$|The {{different}} sources of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) generation were investigated in six small Egyptian Cities in Nile Delta region. These sources were households, open areas, workshops as well as administrative, health, educational, tourism and sports institutions. The rate of MSW generation varied from one city to another according to population and standards of living. In general, most of MSW were generated from households and open areas. The percentage of these two sources amounted to be 57. 27, 18. 15 % in Banha City; 45. 85, 48. 55 % in Tala City; 28. 23, 48. 89 % in Santa City; 63. 37, 20. 38 % in Belkas City; 36. 97, 43. 23 % in Kafer El-Shaekh City and 38. 30, 36. 05 % in Faraskour City respectively.

40|$|Aims: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the composition of dental waste coming from six dental health services in Isfahan, Iran. Materials and Methods: From 45 public dental clinics in Isfahan, six public dental health services were selected (three dental clinics and three dental centers). Waste collection took place from October to December 2011. During this period, three samples were collected from each dental clinic and were divided to pre-determined groups manually. Results: In dental centers, the amount of infectious, non-infectious and domestic-type waste accounting for 45. 07 %, 12. 15 % and 42. 78 %, respectively. Whereas in dental clinics the production rates of infectious, non-infectious and domestic-type waste accounting for 52. 2 %, 8. 58 % and 39. 22 %, respectively. Conclusion: Overall, according to the results it can be said that integration of infectious and hazardous waste with general waste leads to the amount of infectious waste appears much greater than it actually is. The collection and disposal of amalgam and other hazardous dental solid waste should be regulated as soon as possible and to decrease the costs of dental waste management the uncontaminated <b>recyclable</b> <b>items,</b> which contained approximately 33 % of total dental waste should be recycled or reused if possible...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a current state-of-the art of {{municipal solid waste}} (MSW) management and recycling in Malaysia. It was revealed that mainly four sources {{were involved in the}} recycling program, e. g. recycle centers, recycle boxes, waste collectors and paper recyclers (by door to door collection system). On average, paper, aluminum, glass and plastic account for 63, 21, 15 and 1 % of the recycled materials, respectively. The total waste generation was estimated to be 144 tons/day in Serdang and Seri Kembangan areas {{based on the number of}} collection vehicles, trips per day and vehicle capacity. The total recycled quantity was, however, about 2678 kg/day. Only 1. 8 % of total generated MSW was recycled, which is deemed to be very low compared to developed countries. Therefore, it is recommended to educate, motivate and encourage the citizens of Malaysia for reusing, recovering and recycling. It requires collaborative and consistent efforts, and technical know-how for a successful recycling program. Finally, some possible means of promoting the recycling program were recommended based on the current practice of developed countries. The first step would be the separation of <b>recyclable</b> <b>items</b> at sources or generation points. The local authorities and recycling organizations can play an important role in educating/motivating general mass through producing and disseminating appropriate guidelines...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{environmental}} management practices presently adopted by accommodation providers, nature-based attractions and tour operators in Douglas Shire, North Queensland. Seventy-five tourism operators were surveyed in Douglas Shire by telephone, email surveyor postal survey {{to explore their}} implementation of techniques for water conservation, energy conservation, liquid waste management, solid waste management, sustainable design and other sustainable practices. The environmental management practices were derived from Ecotourism Australia's Nature and Ecotourism Accreditation Program (NEAP), other leading tourism associations and previous studies investigating environmental management techniques in use at accommodation establishments (Firth & Hing, 2001; Carlson, Getz & Ali-Knight, 1998; Buckley & Araujo, 1997). Both ecotourism certified and non-certified tourism businesses {{were included in the}} study sample. The study found environmental management techniques that are both simple and cost- effective are the most common practices used by tourism operations and these environmental management practices are implemented for the reason of better environmental management and to comply with environmental or World Heritage legislation. Issues identified by tourism operators as impeding the implementation of environmental management techniques were the limited collection of <b>recyclable</b> <b>items</b> within the Shire, the high cost of installing and maintaining alternative energy and water practices, and the existing environmental knowledge of some operators. Hence, this study suggests key areas where Shire Councils and tourism associations can assist tour operators to improve their environmental practices...|$|E

The workshop consisted of a PowerPoint presentation by the researcher demonstrating how children learn from household or locally available and inexpensive items, (e. g.,sorting rocks, setting the table, nesting containers) and included live demonstrations. The workshop covered the following areas of child development: 1) theories of child development [...] Vygotsky, Brofenbrenner and Piaget 2) the social development of the three- and four-year-olds;and 3) the effects of media advertising on young children. Further, the workshop addressed the topic of homemade toys and the positive effects they have on the parent/child relationship and consideration of the notion that the benefits of creating and utilizing children's learning opportunities at home surpass the benefits of children's play with store-bought toys. Results revealed that participating parents reported gaining increased self-confidence in their ability to make toys for their young children from household, <b>recyclable</b> <b>items.</b> Participants also reported having learned about the power of media advertising and that its claims are not to be automatically believed.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{attitudes toward}} {{sustainable}} behavior refer to an individual's responsibility {{in using the}} natural resources granted by Allah S. W. T. while taking into consideration the interests of future generations. These actions must start from oneself, and include simple and immediately necessary actions. For example, recycling is a simple practice that must be engaged in by all individuals. As a leading university that launched a SUSTAINABLE PROGRAM involving {{the majority of its}} highly educated community, its image would be tarnished if this simple practice was not carried out. Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM), through its zero waste campus initiative and in collaboration with the research group of Alam Flora Sdn Bhd, has deployed recycling activities effectively since 2010 using an improved a management recycling system, improving existing facilities and intensifying awareness campaigns. However, the response from the UKM community is low, with an average recycling rate of 1. 93 % and an average of five persons/week who sent <b>recyclable</b> <b>items</b> to the UKM Recycling Center between April 2010 and September 2011. Surveys taken regarding the involvement of the UKM community in recycling activity are discussed to obtain an overview of the facilities and the changes required to improve the recycling management system. Based on a problem analysis using a fishbone diagram, people's attitudes are shown to be a primary cause of the low response to the recycling program. The targeted recycling rate of 20 % requires the continued cooperation and efforts of the entire UKM community to promote an educated culture of sustainability at the University...|$|E
