However, a technology that is energy efficient and recovers both Zn and Fe has only recently been developed to a commercial scale with the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Hearth</b> <b>Furnace.</b> Various other technologies have been proposed as alternatives to the historically preferred Waelz Kiln process.

40|$|Straw fiber {{is a waste}} {{obtained}} by jet milling after extracting valuable substances form corn straw through steam explosion-washing-mechanical carding process. At the same time, {{it is also a}} clean and renewable reducing agent. In this study, physical and chemical characteristics of straw fiber were investigated firstly. The usage of straw fiber in <b>rotary</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> process for direct reduced iron production was then discussed. The results show that on one hand, fixed carbon content in straw fiber is low, which is unfavorable for the productivity of direct reduced iron; on the other hand, ash and sulfur content is also low, which improves the quality of direct reduced iron. Besides, the fibrous structure is conducive to improving the pelletizing performance of carbon-containing pellets, thus reducing an additional amount of binder. Compared with common reducing agents, straw fiber provides better reduction effect, and straw fiber carbon-containing pellets possess higher compressive strength and larger volumetric shrinkage, which is beneficial to increase the thickness of the whole material layer in <b>rotary</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace.</b> In addition, these carbon-containing pellets also have advantages of lowering C/O ratio and shortening reduction time. The appropriate C/O and reduction time are 0. 8 and 15 min, respectively, and the particle size of straw fiber below 0. 15 mm has better reduction effect. This study aims to provide theoretical and technical basis for the utilization of straw fiber in <b>rotary</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> process...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of slag and iron separation, a new idea of "the separation of slag (solid state) and iron (molten state) in <b>rotary</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> process at lower temperature" is put forward. In this paper, the forming process of iron nuggets has been investigated. Based on those results, the forming mechanisms and influencing factors of iron nugget at low temperature are discussed experimentally using an electric resistance furnace simulating a <b>rotary</b> <b>hearth</b> <b>furnace</b> process. Results show that the reduction of iron ore, carburization of reduced iron, and the composition and quantity of slag are very important for producing iron nuggets at lower temperature. Reduction reaction of carbon-containing pellets is mainly at 1273 K and 1473 K (1000 A degrees C and 1200 A degrees C). When the temperature is above 1473 K (1200 A degrees C), the metallization rate of carbon-containing pellets exceeds 93 pct, and the reduction reaction is substantially complete. Direct carburization is the main method for carburization of reduced iron. This reaction occurs above 1273 K (1000 A degrees C), with carburization degree increasing greatly at 1473 K and 1573 K (1200 A degrees C and 1300 A degrees C) after particular holding times. Besides, to achieve the "slag (solid state) and iron (molten state) separation," the melting point of the slag phase should be increased. Slag (solid state) and iron (molten state) separation can be achieved below 1573 K (1300 A degrees C), and when the holding time is 20 minutes, C/O is 0. 7, basicity is less than 0. 5 and a Na 2 CO 3 level of 3 pct, the recovery rate of iron can reach 90 pct, with a proportion of iron nuggets more than 3. 15 mm of nearly 90 pct.
