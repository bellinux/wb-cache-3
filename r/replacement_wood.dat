Some older area residents have fond memories of playing in the building and the initials some of them carved into the wood are still visible. The latest major restoration left as much of the original wood as possible in place. This is distinguished by its dark stain while the <b>replacement</b> <b>wood</b> was left its original lighter color.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of the American entry into World War II, the U.S. Army was still issuing the M1917 to Chemical Mortarmen. Perhaps due to M1 Garand {{shortages}} {{at the start of the}} war, the M1917 was also issued to artillerymen early in the war and both mortarmen and artillerymen carried the M1917 in North Africa. Lieutenant Colonel Charles E. Peterson (USAR, retired; 1920-2005), a Major in the 101st Airborne in the Normandy action, reported seeing some M1917 rifles issued to rear-echelon US troops in France during World War II. Other M1917 rifles were issued to the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary. After the fall of the Philippines, M1917 rifles were used by Japanese police forces as well as by U.S. and Filipino soldiers with the local guerrillas before the liberation of the Philippines.Before and during World War II, stored rifles were reconditioned for use as reserve, training and Lend-Lease weapons; these rifles are identified by having refinished metal (sandblasted and Parkerized) and sometimes <b>replacement</b> <b>wood</b> (often birch). Some of these rifles were reconditioned with new bolts manufactured by the United Shoe Machinery Company and stamped USMC leading to the mistaken impression these were United States Marine Corps rifles. Many were bought by the United Kingdom through the British Purchasing Commission for use by the Home Guard; 615,000 arrived in Britain in the summer of 1940, followed by a further 119,000 in 1941. These were prominently marked with a red paint stripe around the stock to avoid confusion with the earlier P14 that used the British [...]303 round. Others were supplied to the Nationalist Chinese forces, to indigenous forces in the China-Burma-India theatre, to Filipino soldiers under the Philippine Army and Constabulary units and the local guerrilla forces and to the Free French Army, which can occasionally be seen in wartime photographs. The M1917 was also issued to the Local Defence Force of the Irish Army during World War II, these were part-time soldiers akin to the British Home Guard. In an ironic reversal of names, in Irish service the M1917 was often referred to as the [...] "Springfield"; presumably since an [...] "Enfield" [...] rifle was assumed to be the standard Irish MkIII Short Magazine Lee-Enfield, while [...] "Springfield" [...] was known to be an American military arsenal.|$|E

5000|$|Alder was {{plentiful}} and cheap; the tree grows next to streams. The wood {{is easy to}} work by hand, but not durable in damp conditions. Like elm {{it needs to be}} fully immersed in water for it to be durable. It is quite light, and could be cut into a thick sole without adding too much weight. According to Grew and de Neergaard it is [...] "resilient and extremely durable when wet, and has been the favourite material for clog-making in England right up to the present day". It was popular in the hot industries (steel making for example) because <b>replacement</b> <b>woods</b> could be quickly made, and it was rarely constantly damp. However being relatively soft, it makes a poor dance clog, where sound is important. Another disadvantage is that the wood has a tendency to split if taken from the centre of the tree. So much alder was used for clogs that in parts of Wales it was called Pren Clocsia (Clog Wood) ratherthan Gwern.|$|R

50|$|A 2009 {{restoration}} {{project at}} the Cottage has enabled the site to more accurately relate {{the story of the}} building once owned by one of the leading figures in America’s fight for Independence. The stewards of the Cottage, members of the Huguenot and New Rochelle Historical Association, were able to raise funds to complete critically needed repairs on the 200+ year old building. In the process, the group also recognized the need to return the building to its original integrity, to the extent documented in archival photographs and by physical evidence. With a $50,000 grant obtained by State Assemblywoman Amy Paulin and individual donations, the Association hired local architect John Woodruff and the restoration firm, Salem Preservation, Inc. of Salem, NY, for the exterior’s restoration. As the Cottage is also a locally-designated property, the New Rochelle Historical and Landmarks Review Board reviewed all aspects of the project before it moved forward. The work included the removal of the asphalt roof and <b>replacement</b> with <b>wood</b> shingles, which also included exposing two original windows on the upper floor. Other major work to restore the building to its original integrity involved the reconstruction of a separate roof above the porch and below the windows and the <b>replacement</b> of <b>wood</b> shingles on the entire house with Weatherboard and the repair and replacement of gutters and wood trim.|$|R

These modern gliders required longer take-off and landing areas, and {{large areas of the}} airfield were levelled.

50|$|An {{infiltration}} pseudomorph, or substitution pseudomorph is a pseudomorph {{in which}} one mineral or other material is replaced by another.

An example of this process is the <b>replacement</b> of <b>wood</b> by silica (quartz or opal) to form petrified wood in which the substitution may be so perfect as to retain the original cellular structure of the wood. An example of mineral-to-mineral substitution is replacement of aragonite twin crystals by native copper, as occurs at the Corocoro United Copper Mines of Coro Coro, Bolivia.|$|R

It was a fight to stay in the league, and when Castleford lost to Wakefield Trinity, it confirmed their relegation. Many Castleford fans do not accept this relegation and it become a grave point of contention with the governing body.

30|$|Rot {{is known}} to affect the {{strength}} properties of wood. At the same time, the damping properties of the attacked material have {{also been shown to}} change. This article presents the results of an experimental study in which rot in wood was modeled by the <b>replacement</b> of <b>wood</b> with sand. The procedure entailed the drilling of holes in the body of a wooden beam, filling the holes with sand, and monitoring the changes induced by the sand-filled holes on the values of the modulus of elasticity (MOE) and of the loss factor. The MOE was calculated from the resonance frequency of the first longitudinal mode of vibration, and the loss factor was obtained indirectly from the impulse response by means of a room acoustical technique. The results show that the MOE value, and hence the strength characteristic of the wood specimen, decreases {{at the same time as}} the loss factor increases.|$|R
