40|$|In this study, rural {{households}} livelihood {{strategies in}} communities around Fort Hare and Middle Drift dairy {{projects in the}} Nkonkobe Municipality are explored from a household perspective. Rural communities around Fort Hare and Middle Drift dairy projects in Eastern Cape, South Africa are found choosing a multiple of livelihood portfolios that are linked to dairy project activities to increase food, generate income, and safeguard against risks and shocks. The <b>dairy</b> projects in <b>rural</b> areas can reduced the problem of shrinking livelihood options in rural areas were most of the households are relying on government grants which has characterised the rural areas with long queues during month ends. The main objectives of this study are, to assess whether the <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> projects set goals are being achieved; to identify dominant livelihood strategies of households living around dairy projects in Eastern Cape Province, South Africa and to identify determinant factors influencing <b>rural</b> households around <b>dairy</b> projects to choose certain livelihood strategies that improve their welfare. The study analysed socio-economic survey data that had been collected from households in six rural villages in Nkonkobe Municipality surrounding the Fort Hare and Middle drift dairy projects. The stratified and random sampling method was used. The descriptive analysis comparing the livelihood portfolios’ in the six rural villages around Fort hare and Middle Drift dairy projects has revealed {{that there is an}} increasingly important role of the non-farm economy in the area (income from activities not linked to farming) as compared to farming, non-labour (income from remittances and government grants) and non-farm activities that are combined with farming (non-farm and farming activities). The multinomial logistic regression model revealed, with respect to the household variables, social-economic and institutional related variables as some of the barriers faced by poor households in rural areas sharing boundaries with <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> projects to enter into various livelihood strategies. Results from this study outlined that <b>rural</b> communities around <b>dairy</b> projects do not rely much on one livelihood pathway but they link multiple strategies together to improve their standard of living. The study, therefore, conclude that <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> projects with activities that are complementing with rural livelihood pathways available can be trusted as a reliable and sustainable livelihood source to reduce poverty in communities which share boundaries with <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> projects...|$|R

The study described in this brief makes an institutional analysis of dairy markets and evaluates determinants of dairy market participation by agricultural households in Côte d’Ivoire. Results can be used to draw policy recommendations that take into account a larger population of agricultural households. For example, the implications of higher market prices or lower transactions costs can be evaluated for not only the volume of marketed surplus from existing cattle owners, but also for the propensity of rural households more broadly to adopt livestock.

Dairy {{products in the}} area were sampled in the first season, and chemically analyzed and assessed for microbial profile. ILCA (International Livestock Centre for Africa) wooden agitator for milk fat separation was used and compared with the traditional milk churning method. In the second season, ILCA agitator was modified {{to fit into the}} local gourd instead of the original clay pot. In the third season, the three methods were compared in a 3 x 2 factorial experiment using milk condition (fresh vs. boiled) as a second factor. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the hygiene measures in <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> products and to assess the introduced wooden agitator for milk fat extraction. The <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> products sampled had high total bacteria and mold counts and reflected poor hygiene and sanitation measures. Both ILCA wooden agitator and the modified model had significantly (P< 0. 01) reduced churning time and resulted in higher ghee yield of good quality compared to the traditional method. Considerable proportion of milk fat was lost to butter milk in the traditional method in comparison with ILCA and the modified wooden agitators (P< 0. 001). ILCA wooden agitator was superior to the traditional method in terms of money returns. Both ILCA and the modified wooden agitators were easy to operate and had a time saving advantage compared to the traditional method. It was concluded that the modified wooden agitator should be advocated for more rural women in the area and similar ecological zones.

Multivariable linear regression showed that wood consumption increased by 2 lbs/day for each additional family member living on a farm. For an average family of three people, the addition of one cow was associated with increased wood consumption by 1. 0 lb/day on biogas farms but by 4. 4 lbs/day on referent farms (significant interaction variable - likely due to additional hot water for cleaning milk collection equipment).

The plant is located in a <b>rural</b> <b>dairy</b> farming area, with no other significant CO 2 ff sources nearby, but large, diurnally varying, biospheric CO 2 fluxes from the surrounding highly productive agricultural grassland. We made flask measurements of CO 2 and 14 CO 2 (from which we derive the CO 2 ff component) and in situ measurements of CO 2 downwind of the Kapuni plant, using a Helikite to sample transects across the emission plume from the surface up to 100 m above ground level. We also determined the surface CO 2 ff content averaged over several weeks from the 14 C content of grass samples collected from the surrounding area. We use the WindTrax plume dispersion model to compare the atmospheric observations with the emissions reported by the Kapuni plant, and to determine how well atmospheric measurements can constrain the emissions. The model has difficulty accurately capturing the fluctuations and short-term variability in the Helikite samples, but does quite well in representing the observed CO 2 ff in 15 min averaged surface flask samples and in ~ one week integrated CO 2 ff averages from grass samples.

The aim {{of this study was to}} compare indoor endotoxin concentrations in air and dust samples from randomly selected urban and rural dwellings. In the rural area, endotoxins were analysed in farmhouses and nonfarmhouses as well as housing characteristics, lifestyle factors and agricultural practices likely to influence air and dust endotoxin levels. Endotoxin levels were significantly higher in floor (6600 ± 6100 vs 3600 ± 5600 and 3800 ± 17, 000 ng g⁻¹; P < 0 · 001) and mattress dust (2900 ± 4100 vs 1100 ± 2400 and 800 ± 2600 ng g⁻¹; P < 0 · 001) from farmhouses compared to other rural and urban homes. However, no difference was observed between endotoxin concentrations in the air of urban and rural houses, and airborne endotoxin levels did not correlate to dust levels.

40|$|Conventional {{ranching}} in Chiapas, Mexico typically includes annual pasture {{burns and}} agrochemical use that decrease the biodiversity and forest cover of ranch lands. Members of a holistic ranching "club" in the Frailesca region of Chiapas, Mexico have {{moved away from}} this conventional management by eliminating burns and agrochemicals from their systems after decades of use because {{they believed that the}} land and their production process were growing unhealthy; they were further motivated by extension courses on holistic ranching. They have also implemented sophisticated systems of rotational grazing and diversified the use of trees. For this study all seven holistic ranchers and 18 neighboring conventional ranchers were interviewed about their cattle ranches and production strategies. An emergy analysis was conducted to compare the resource use, productivity and sustainability of the conventional and holistic ranches. Holistic ranches were found to have double the emergy sustainability index (ESI) values of conventional ranches, and the emergy yield ratio was 25 % higher in holistic systems. Government assistance programs were found to {{have a negative impact on}} the ESI and were variably administered among holistic ranchers during the year of emergy evaluation. Overall improved emergy sustainability did not decrease milk nor cattle productivity. Transformities and specific emergies, the emergy of one type required to make a unit of energy (transformity) or mass (specific emergy) of another type, did not differ between conventional and holistic systems. Transformities for milk production ranged between 3. 4 E 5 and 1. 2 E 7 solar emjoules/joule (sej/J). Specific emergy for cattle production ranged from 3. 5 E 10 to 1. 5 E 11 Â sej/g.
