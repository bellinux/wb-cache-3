25|$|Since 2004, {{the large}} number of orders {{increased}} demand for shipyard slots, raising their price and increasing ship costs. The per-ton construction cost of an LNG liquefaction plant fell steadily from the 1970s through the 1990s. The cost reduced by approximately 35 percent. However, recently the cost of building liquefaction and <b>regasification</b> terminals doubled due to increased cost of materials and a shortage of skilled labor, professional engineers, designers, managers and other white-collar professionals.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} infrastructure needed for LNG production and transportation is an LNG plant consisting {{of one or}} more LNG trains, each of which is an independent unit for gas liquefaction. The largest LNG train now in operation is in Qatar. These facilities recently reached a safety milestone, completing 12 years of operations on its offshore facilities without a Lost Time Incident. Until recently it was the Train4 of Atlantic LNG in Trinidad and Tobago with a production capacity of 5.2 million metric ton per annum (mmtpa), followed by the SEGAS LNG plant in Egypt with a capacity of 5mmtpa. In July 2014, Atlantic LNG celebrated its 3000th cargo of LNG at the company’s liquefaction facility in Trinidad. The QatargasII plant has a production capacity of 7.8mmtpa for each of its two trains. LNG sourced from Qatargas II will be supplied to Kuwait, following the signing of an agreement in May 2014 between Qatar Liquefied Gas Company and Kuwait Petroleum Corp. LNG is loaded onto ships and delivered to a <b>regasification</b> terminal, where the LNG is allowed to expand and reconvert into gas. <b>Regasification</b> terminals are usually connected to a storage and pipeline distribution network to distribute natural gas to local distribution companies (LDCs) or independent power plants (IPPs).|$|E
25|$|Wison Group (Chinese: 惠生集团) is an engineering, procurement, and {{construction}} company, or EPC firm {{which focuses on}} the industries of energy and high-technology. The company attracted significant international coverage {{in the first half}} of 2012 by winning a contract to “engineer, procure, construct, install, and commission” (EPCIC) the world’s first “floating LNG liquefaction, <b>regasification,</b> and storage unit” off the coast of Colombia. Wison also formed a consortium with Hyundai Engineering & construction Co. to sign a contract with PDVSA, Venezuela’s state-owned oil company, to expand PDVSA's Puerto la Cruz refinery.|$|E
25|$|In June, 2012, Wison Offshore & Marine, a {{subsidiary}} to Wison Group, {{was awarded the}} contract to build the 'world's first floating LNG Liquefaction, <b>Regasification,</b> and Storage unit.' Referred to as a FLRSU, the production unit will be delivered to Exmar under a contract with Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. to start operation in Q4 2014 {{off the coast of}} Colombia. It will be a non-propelled barge, and will have a capacity of converting 69.5 MMcf/d of natural gas into LNG. It will be built in the Wison Offshore & Marine fabrication facility in Nantong, China. Additional assistance will be provided by the Houston, Texas branch of Wison Offshore & Marine. Black & Veatch will provide engineering and procurement of the topside liquefaction equipment.|$|E

Shipborne <b>regasification</b> equipment is also used.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, prices for {{constructing}} LNG plants, receiving terminals and vessels fell as new technologies emerged and more players invested in liquefaction and <b>regasification.</b> This tended to make LNG more competitive {{as a means}} of energy distribution, but increasing material costs and demand for construction contractors have put upward pressure on prices in the last few years.|$|E
2500|$|LNG is transported {{using both}} tanker truck, railway tanker, and purpose built ships known as LNG carriers. LNG will be {{sometimes}} taken to cryogenic temperatures {{to increase the}} tanker capacity. The first commercial ship-to-ship transfer (STS) transfers were undertaken in February 2007 at the Flotta facility in Scapa Flow with 132,000 m3 of LNG being passed between the vessels Excalibur and Excelsior. [...] Transfers have also been carried out by Exmar Shipmanagement, the Belgian gas tanker owner in the Gulf of Mexico, which involved the transfer of LNG from a conventional LNG carrier to an LNG <b>regasification</b> vessel (LNGRV). Prior to this commercial exercise LNG had only ever been transferred between ships {{on a handful of}} occasions as a necessity following an incident. SIGTTO - the Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators is the responsible body for LNG operators around the world and seeks to disseminate knowledge regarding the safe transport of LNG at sea.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{financial}} year 2012–13, {{the production of}} crude oil is 37.86 million tons and 40,679 million standard cubic meters (nearly 26.85 million tons) natural gas. The net import of crude oil [...] & petroleum products is 146.70 million tons worth of Rs 5611.40 billions. This includes 9.534 million tons of LNG imports worth of Rs. 282.15 billions. Internationally, LNG price [...] (One mmBtu of LNG = 0.1724 barrels of crude oil (boe) = 24.36 cubic meters of natural gas = 29.2 litres diesel = 21.3 kg LPG) is fixed below crude oil price in terms of heating value. LNG is slowly gaining its role as direct use fuel in road [...] and marine transport without <b>regasification.</b> By the end of June 2016, LNG price has fallen by nearly 50% below its oil parity price making it more economical fuel than diesel/gas oil in transport sector. [...] In 2012-13, India consumed 15.744 million tons petrol and 69.179 million tons diesel which are mainly produced from imported crude oil at huge foreign exchange out go. Use of natural gas [...] for heating, cooking and electricity generation is not economical {{as more and more}} locally produced natural gas will be converted into LNG for use in transport sector to reduce crude oil imports. In addition to the conventional natural gas production, coal gasification, coal bed methane, coal mine methane and Biogas digesters / Renewable natural gas will also become source of LNG forming decentralised base for production of LNG to cater to the widely distributed demand. There is possibility to convert most of the heavy duty vehicles [...] (including diesel driven rail engines) into [...] LNG fuelled vehicles to reduce diesel consumption drastically with operational cost and least pollution benefits. Also, the break even price at user end for switching from imported coal to LNG in electricity generation is estimated near 6 US$/mmBtu. The advent of cheaper marine CNG transport will restrict LNG use in high end transport sector to replace costly liquid fuels leaving imported CNG use for other needs. As the marine CNG transport is economical for medium distance transport and has fast unloading flexibility at many ports without costly unloading facilities, they have become alternate solution to submarine gas pipelines.|$|E
50|$|At {{the other}} end of the LNG {{logistics}} chain, where the natural gas is brought back to ambient temperature and pressure, specially modified ships may also be used as floating storage and <b>regasification</b> units (FSRUs). A LNG floating storage and <b>regasification</b> unit receives liquefied natural gas (LNG) from offloading LNG carriers, and the onboard <b>regasification</b> system provides natural gas exported to shore through risers and pipelines.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{abundant}} availability of natural gas, and the mature technology and its acceptability {{in using the}} LNG directly (without <b>regasification)</b> in road and rail vehicles would lead to lesser demand for LNG <b>regasification</b> plants.|$|E
