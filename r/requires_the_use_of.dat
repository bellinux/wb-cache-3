5|$|Many {{parallel}} programs {{require that}} their subtasks act in synchrony. This <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a barrier. Barriers are typically implemented using a software lock. One class of algorithms, known as lock-free and wait-free algorithms, altogether avoids {{the use of}} locks and barriers. However, this approach is generally difficult to implement and requires correctly designed data structures.|$|E

50|$|Executive {{control is}} known to involve three main {{components}} including selective attention/inhibition, attention shifting, and working memory. In a separate study, Bialystok examined the difference in development and subsequent coordination of these three components of executive function in bilingual children as opposed to that of monolingual children. Two groups of children who were either monolingual or bilingual completed a complex classification task that <b>required</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> either one or multiple components of executive control functions. This was done with <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> visual and/or auditory stimuli, where a single-modality version presented either the visual or auditory component, <b>requiring</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> just one executive control component, and a dual-modality version that combined the two, and therefore <b>required</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> multiple executive control components. The single-modality condition did not elicit significantly different performance by either the monolinguals or bilinguals, however, in the dual-modality condition that <b>required</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> multiple components, bilinguals performed with much higher accuracy than the monolinguals.|$|R

5|$|Keeping {{track of}} a driver's HOS <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> a log book. A truck driver's log {{book is a}} legally defined form {{containing}} a grid outlining the 24-hour day into 15-minute increments. The driver must specify where and when he/she stopped between driving shifts, what duties were performed (if any), along with the driver's name, truck number, company info, and other information. The driver must also present his or her log book to authorities upon request, for inspection. In lieu of a log book, a motor carrier may substitute an electronic on-board recorder to record the driver's hours.|$|E
5|$|Other {{methods for}} elucidating the {{cellular}} location of proteins <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> known compartmental markers for regions {{such as the}} ER, the Golgi, lysosomes or vacuoles, mitochondria, chloroplasts, plasma membrane, etc. With the use of fluorescently tagged versions of these markers or of antibodies to known markers, it becomes much simpler to identify the localization of a protein of interest. For example, indirect immunofluorescence will allow for fluorescence colocalization and demonstration of location. Fluorescent dyes are used to label cellular compartments for a similar purpose.|$|E

5|$|It {{is largely}} an {{empirical}} procedure, {{and has a}} reasonable safety record {{within the scope of}} its intended application. Advantages are reduced overall decompression time and for some versions, easy estimation of decompression by the use of a simple rule-based procedure which can be done underwater by the diver. It <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> specific gas mixtures for given depth ranges. The advantages claimed are flexibility in that if the depth is not known accurately, the schedule can be adjusted during the dive to allow for the actual depth, and that it allows deep dives without the use of an expensive trimix dive computer.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid is a {{completely}} synthetic drug: it does not occur in nature (unlike erythromycin and many other antibiotics) and was not developed by building upon a naturally occurring skeleton (unlike most beta-lactams, which are semisynthetic). Many approaches are available for oxazolidinone synthesis, and several routes for the synthesis of linezolid {{have been reported in}} the chemistry literature. Despite good yields, the original method (developed by Upjohn for pilot plant-scale production of linezolid and eperezolid) is lengthy, <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> expensive chemicals—such as palladium on carbon and the highly sensitive reagents methanesulfonyl chloride and n-butyllithium—and needs low-temperature conditions. Much of the high cost of linezolid has been attributed to the expense of its synthesis. A somewhat more concise and cost-effective route better suited to large-scale production was patented by Upjohn in 1998.|$|E
5|$|Players {{are able}} to move around the {{battlefield}} freely, but they {{have the option to}} create predefined paths for the character to follow. While moving along these paths, characters gain access to Hero actions, which make them immune to damage and speed up charge times. However, the use of these Hero actions <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> Bezels; these items are an essential element in battle and are recharged through a variety of methods, such as destroying portions of an enemy's weapons and armor, or killing an enemy. Characters using Hero actions can attack while jumping in the air, and are also able to unleash special attacks which manifest as stylish firearm maneuvers. Enemies are only able to move while the player's current character is moving and will usually attack only that character.|$|E

5|$|The {{forewings}} {{are short}} oblong leathery plates {{used to cover}} the hindwings like the elytra of a beetle, rather than to fly. Most species have short and leather-like forewings with very thin hindwings, though species in the former suborders Arixeniina and Hemimerina (epizoic species, sometimes considered as ectoparasites) are wingless and blind with filiform segmented cerci (today these are both included merely as families in the suborder Neodermaptera). The hindwing is a very thin membrane that expands like a fan, radiating from one point folded under the forewing. Even though most earwigs have wings and are capable of flight, they are rarely seen in flight. These wings are unique in venation and {{in the pattern of}} folding that <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> the cerci.|$|E

Alternatively, there is a secret idol in Wave 8 that will reveal the hidden exit. To pass <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> both TNT and the Sankara Stones.

5|$|Schools {{have been}} the center of {{controversy}} over both the anthem and the national flag. The Tokyo Board of Education <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> both the anthem and flag at events under their jurisdiction. The order requires school teachers to respect both symbols or risk losing their jobs. Some have protested that such rules violate the Constitution of Japan, but the Board has argued that since schools are government agencies, their employees {{have an obligation to}} teach their students how to be good Japanese citizens. As a sign of protest, schools refused to display the Hinomaru at school graduations and some parents ripped down the flag. Teachers have unsuccessfully brought criminal complaints against Tokyo Governor Shintarō Ishihara and senior officials for ordering teachers to honor the Hinomaru and Kimigayo. After earlier opposition, the Japan Teachers Union accepts the use of both the flag and anthem; the smaller All Japan Teachers and Staffs Union still opposes both symbols and their use inside the school system.|$|E

5|$|The game offers four {{different}} difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game. The game is segmented into protecting six different villages, and each village is broken up into four levels: a Day level, a Boss level, a Night level, and a bonus level. Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village. The bonus level drops the top-down camera view and is played {{from the perspective}} of the driver seat of the car. Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game. Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them. For example, the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car's regular guns and instead <b>requires</b> <b>the</b> <b>use</b> <b>of</b> napalm to destroy it.|$|E
