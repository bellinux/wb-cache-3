40|$|The study {{develops}} a formulation to decompose variability in profit into price and production effects. The production effect is further segregated into management and weather effects. The formulation {{is used to}} compare and decompose risk in the profit of three existing cropping patterns (corn-corn, corn-fallow, and rice-fallow) in the rainfed areas of Claveria, northern Mindanao, Philippines. High variability and low profitability of the crops in a more risky season (dry in our case) can limit cropping intensities in rainfed areas. However, intensification of the crops during the less risky season (wet in our case) can provide the necessary stake {{to invest in the}} risky season crops. Although weather is the dominant factor in explaining total variability, this should not be interpreted as a general rule for all agricultural environments. In an environment where input intensity is high, and input-output markets are inefficient, management and price effects can dominate the weather effect.

40|$|In {{remanufacturing}} research, {{most researchers}} predominantly emphasised on {{the recovery of}} whole product (core) {{rather than at the}} component level due to its complexity. In contrast, this paper addresses the challenges to focus on remanufacturing through component recovery, so as to solve production planning problems of hybrid remanufacturing and manufacturing systems. To deal with the uncertainties of quality and quantity of product returns, the processing time of remanufacturing, remanufacturing costs, as well as market demands, a robust optimisation model was developed in this research and a case study was used to evaluate its effectiveness and efficiency. To strengthen this research, a sensitivity analysis of the uncertain parameters and the original equipment manufacturer’s (OEM’s) pricing strategy was also conducted. The research finding shows that the market demand volatility leads to {{a significant increase in the}} under fulfilment and a reduction in OEM’s profit. On the other hand, recovery cost reduction, as endogenous cost saving, encourages the OEM to produce more remanufactured products with the increase in market demand. Furthermore, the OEM may <b>risk</b> <b>profit</b> loss if they raise the price of new products, and inversely, they could gain more if the price of remanufactured products is raised...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{examines the}} predictability of a profit maximization model, an expected value-variance utility maximization (E-V) model, and {{two versions of}} the target-MOTAD model for modeling risky agricultural production decisions. Model solutions were trans-lated into expected value and variance of farm income for analysis. Direct comparison and chi-square analysis of actual and predicted expected income distributions were used in the analyses. It was concluded that the utility maximization and cash-cost target-MOTAD models predicted distributions of farm income better than the variable-cost target-MOTAD and profit maximization models. Key Words: decision models, expected utility maximization, farm income, profit maxi-mization, target-MOTAD.

The following econometric methods are employed: (1) Tobit, {{given the nature of}} the dividend data, and (2) the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) to control for endogenous regressors. Significant positive variables found include size, return on assets (ROA), market to book, liquidity and profit growth. It can thus be inferred that larger firm size, profitability, market value, liquidity and profit growth correlate with greater firm pro pensity to distribute money to shareholders, thus supporting the theory of corporate finance. Significant negative variables found include leverage, liquidity squared, capex, beta and tag along 100 %. It is thus inferred that more significantly leveraged companies that invest more heavily in fixed assets and that exhibit high liquidity, higher risk and less conflict between controlling and minority shareholders will be less likely to pay dividends to shareholders. </p...|$|E
40|$|The French {{government}} and private companies are {{currently working on a}} scheme to insure grassland against unfavourable weather conditions. Objectives of this study are 1) to analyse how grassland yield insurance would substitute for self insurance in suckler cow farms, 2) to assess efficiency of these insurance options and 3) to test effects of public supports on insurance demand and profit distribution. To meet these objectives, simulations have been performed thanks to a bio-economic model applied to French suckler cow farms. Different scenarios enables to isolate effects of risk aversion and self insurance, of market insurance, of insurance premium subsidies and additional direct payments. Self insurance is defined as the reduction of animal stocking rate compared to the stocking rate of a risk neutral farmer. Self insurance alone enables to reduce profit variability by 55 % but sensitivity to extreme yield conditions remains high. Rather risk-averse farmers will use both self insurance and market insurance to secure their farm against <b>risk.</b> <b>Profit</b> variation is divided by 70 % and the lowest value of profit increased by 400 %. Market insurance can indeed cover farmers the lowest forage yield at a lower cost than self insurance. Market insurance demand varies from one year to the next according to the availability of extra forage stocks. Both subsidies on insurance premium and a raise of direct payments induce an increase of expected profit and reduce value of the lowest profit.

40|$|Graduation date: 1985 Over {{the past}} decade, feeder cattle backgrounders in the Pacific Northwest {{have been subject}} to sharp price {{fluctuations}} for their output. The result has been variable profits and losses. This situation creates a need for management and marketing techniques which can provide Pacific Northwest cattle ranchers with protection against price risks while enhancing the profitability of their operations. Recent economic literature has shown hedging with futures contracts to be an effective tool for mitigating risk and/or increasing the net revenues of cattle producers in a number of regions of the United States. The objective of this research was to determine whether hedging with futures contracts could have increased the profitability of Pacific Northwest feeder cattle production while decreasing the effects of price volatiliy. To realize this objective, the economic performance of alternative hedging strategies were evaluated for several methods of feeder cattle backgrounding indigenous to the Pacific Northwest region. Four hedging strategies [...] routine, moving average, profit objective, and triangular probability distribution — were evaluated for hedging the output of four simulated production systems. The mean and standard deviation of annual net returns were computed for each hedging strategy to serve as measures of profitability and risk, respectively. The results of not hedging were also obtained to provide a basis for comparing alternative hedging programs. Sample t and F tests were conducted to determine whether there were statistically significant differences between {{the means and standard deviations}} of the unhedged and hedged positions. Dominant hedging strategies were then identified for each production system. Based on the results of the mean-variance analysis, it appears that the use of selective futures market hedging strategies would have provided greater and more stable levels of profit compared to the net incomes obtained without hedging. Sample t and F tests, using 80 and 90 percent levels of significance respectively, showed that hedging could have significantly decreased the variability of the producer's flow of income without significantly changing the operation's average profitability. Moving average, profit objective, and triangular probability distribution strategies were dominant, increased average profitability, and significantly lowered risk for at least one production system each. Overall, moving average strategies generated the highest mean profits with the greatest <b>risk.</b> <b>Profit</b> objective strategies generally resulted in lower mean profit than moving average strategies but with less risk. The risks and returns from hedging with triangular probability distribution strategies were usually between the moving average and profit objective procedures. Strategies which performed well in this study should also perform well in the future if conditions in the feeder cattle markets do not vary substantially from those of the previous decade. Thus, hedging with futures market contracts may provide the Pacific Northwest feeder cattle producers with protection against price risk and enhanced profitability...|$|E
