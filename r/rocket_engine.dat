5|$|In 1923, the American {{scientist}} Robert H. Goddard {{became the}} first person to develop a <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> that burned liquid fuel; the engine used gasoline for fuel and liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. Goddard successfully flew a small liquid-fueled rocket 56m at 97km/h on March 16, 1926 in Auburn, Massachusetts, US.|$|E
5|$|From 2007 to 2009 REL {{worked with}} University of Bristol and Airborne Engineering on Project STERN (Static Test Expansion/Deflection Rocket Nozzle), which tested REL's engine {{ignition}} system, a REL designed air breathing hydrogen <b>rocket</b> <b>engine,</b> and investigated the flow stability and behaviour of with Dr Neil Taylor's expansion deflection nozzle design via multiple test-firings by Airborne Engineering. An expansion_deflection_nozzle {{is capable of}} compensating for the changing ambient pressure encountered while gaining altitude during atmospheric flight, thus generating greater thrust and thereby efficiency.|$|E

The company builds the buses – the underlying structure onto which the payload and propulsion systems are built – {{for most of}} the European Space Agency's spacecraft, as well as commercial satellites. The world leader in compact satellite systems, Surrey Satellites, is also part of Astrium.

5000|$|<b>Rocket</b> <b>engines</b> are {{primarily}} used on rockets, rocket sleds and experimental aircraft. <b>Rocket</b> <b>engines</b> are extremely powerful. The heaviest vehicle ever {{to leave the}} ground, the Saturn V rocket, was powered by five F-1 <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> generating a combined 180 million horsepower (134.2 gigawatt). <b>Rocket</b> <b>engines</b> also have no need to [...] "push off" [...] anything, {{a fact that the}} New York Times denied in error. <b>Rocket</b> <b>engines</b> can be particularly simple, sometimes consisting of nothing more than a catalyst, {{as in the case of}} a hydrogen peroxide rocket. This makes them an attractive option for vehicles such as jet packs. Despite their simplicity, <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> are often dangerous and susceptible to explosions. The fuel they run off may be flammable, poisonous, corrosive or cryogenic. They also suffer from poor efficiency. For these reasons, <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> are only used when absolutely necessary.|$|R

40|$|Prospects for {{the mastery}} of space and the basic {{problems}} which must be solved in developing systems for both manned and cargo spacecraft are examined. The achievements and flaws of rocket boosters are discussed {{as well as the}} use of reusable spacecraft. The need for orbiting satellite solar power plants and related astrionics for active control of large space structures for space stations and colonies in an age of space industrialization is demonstrated. Various forms of spacecraft propulsion are described including liquid propellant <b>rocket</b> <b>engines,</b> nuclear reactors, thermonuclear <b>rocket</b> <b>engines,</b> electrorocket engines, electromagnetic engines, magnetic gas dynamic generators, electromagnetic mass accelerators (rail guns), laser <b>rocket</b> <b>engines,</b> pulse nuclear <b>rocket</b> <b>engines,</b> ramjet thermonuclear <b>rocket</b> <b>engines,</b> and photon <b>rockets.</b> The possibilities of interstellar flight are assessed...|$|R
5|$|An {{alternative}} design {{completed by}} McDonnell Aircraft in 1965 is usually {{considered part of}} Project Isinglass, however some documents refer to the aircraft as having been codenamed Project Rheinberry. McDonnell's proposed boost-glide aircraft, submitted to the CIA independently of the Convair Isinglass proposals, featured a small, manned, rocket-powered craft with a high lift-to-drag ratio that would be air-launched by a B-52 bomber while flying over the Atlantic Ocean. The aircraft would ignite its <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> and adopt a trajectory that would take it over the Soviet Union at speeds of Mach 20 and {{at an altitude of}} over , before descending over the Pacific Ocean to a landing at Groom Lake, Nevada, as a glider, landing on the lake bed using a skid landing gear.|$|E
5|$|Gordon escapes the {{destroyed}} lab. Surviving staff {{tell him}} that communications {{with the outside world}} have been cut and urge him to head to the surface. Gordon fights his way through Black Mesa, defending himself against hostile Xen creatures — such as Vortigaunts and parasitic headcrabs, which attach themselves to human hosts — and US marines sent to cover up the incident. At the surface, Gordon learns that scientists from the Lambda Complex may have a way to close the portal. Gordon travels {{to the other end of}} the facility to assist them. Along the way, he activates a <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> test facility to destroy a giant tentacled creature and uses a disused railway system to reach and launch a satellite rocket. After he is captured by Black Ops and left for dead in a garbage compactor, he escapes and makes his way to an older part of the facility, where he discovers Xen specimens collected before the resonance cascade.|$|E
5|$|Operating an {{air-breathing}} {{jet engine}} at velocities {{of up to}} Mach5.5 poses numerous engineering problems; several previous engines proposed by other designers have worked well as jet engines, but performed poorly as rockets. This engine design aims {{to be a good}} jet engine within the atmosphere, as well as being an excellent <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> outside; however, the conventional problem posed by operating at Mach5.5 has been that the air coming into the engine rapidly heats up as it is compressed into the engine; due to certain thermodynamic effects, this greatly reduces the thrust that can be produced by burning fuel. Attempts to avoid these issues has typically resulted in the engine being much heavier (scramjets/ramjets) or has greatly reduced the thrust generated (conventional turbojets/ramjets); in either of these scenarios, the end result would be an engine that possesses a poor thrust to weight ratio at high speeds, which in turn would be too heavy to assist much in reaching orbit.|$|E

50|$|The <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> for the International Space Station (ISS) are {{controlled}} by an autopilot. Ordinarily, uploaded parameters for controlling the engine control system for the Zvezda module make the <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> boost the International Space Station to a higher orbit. The <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> are hinge-mounted, and ordinarily the crew doesn't notice the operation. On January 14, 2009, however, the uploaded parameters made the autopilot swing the <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> in larger and larger oscillations, at a frequency of 0.5 Hz. These oscillations were captured on video, and lasted for 142 seconds.|$|R
50|$|All spaceplanes to date {{have used}} <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> with {{chemical}} fuels. As the orbital insertion burn {{has to be done}} in space, orbital spaceplanes require <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> for at least that portion of the flight.|$|R
5|$|The Parsons family spent mid-1929 {{on a tour}} of Europe before {{returning}} to Pasadena, where they moved into a house on San Rafael Avenue. With the onset of the Great Depression their fortune began to dwindle, and in July 1931 Jack's grandfather Walter died. Parsons began studying at the privately run University School, a liberal institution that took an unconventional approach to teaching. He flourished academically, becoming editor of the school's newspaper El Universitano and winning an award for literary excellence; teachers who had trained at the nearby California Institute of Technology (Caltech) honed his attentions on the study of chemistry. With the family's financial difficulties deepening, Parsons began working during weekends and school holidays at the offices of the Hercules Powder Company, where he learned more about explosives and their potential use in rocket propulsion. He and Forman continued to independently explore the subject in their spare time, building and testing different rockets, sometimes with materials that Parsons had stolen from work. Parsons soon constructed a solid-fuel <b>rocket</b> <b>engine,</b> and with Forman corresponded with pioneer rocket engineers including Robert H. Goddard, Hermann Oberth, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, Willy Ley and Wernher von Braun. Parsons and von Braun had hours of telephone conversations about rocketry in their respective countries as well as their own research.|$|E
5|$|The next case {{given to}} Sam and Max {{involves}} {{dealing with a}} computer crisis that is causing the world economy to collapse. They discover {{the problem is a}} virtual reality program called Reality 2.0, powered by the Internet (which has gained sentience), which is hypnotizing people so they never want to leave the program. Sam and Max access the program themselves and introduce a computer virus that crashes Reality 2.0 and deletes the digital embodiment of the Internet. Prior to expiring, the Internet reveals that it was following the plans of one Roy G. Biv. Sam eventually deduces that Roy G. Biv is actually Hugh Bliss, a character seemingly in the background of all their previous cases. The Freelance Police travel to Bliss' Prismatology retreat on the Moon, where Bliss is preparing a device to hypnotize the entire planet. Bliss reveals himself as a colony of sentient bacteria that feeds off of the endorphins produced by human happiness; by hypnotizing the planet, Bliss assures himself of a permanent supply of nourishment. Bliss activates the device, but is killed when Sam tricks him into a tank of water and boils it using the <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> of a lunar lander. Returning to Earth, Max takes great pleasure in reversing the hypnotism by personally knocking everyone on the planet unconscious.|$|E

50|$|During World War II, when {{powerful}} <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> {{were first}} {{considered by the}} German, American and Soviet engineers independently, all discovered that <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> need high mass flow rate of both oxidizer and fuel to generate a sufficient thrust. At that time oxygen and low molecular weight hydrocarbons were used as oxidizer and fuel pair. At room temperature and pressure, both are in gaseous state. Hypothetically, if propellants had been stored as pressurized gases, the size and mass of fuel tanks themselves would severely decrease rocket efficiency. Therefore, to get the required mass flow rate, the only option was to cool the propellants down to cryogenic temperatures (below −183 °C K, −253 °C K), converting them to liquid form. Hence, all cryogenic <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> are also, by definition, either liquid-propellant <b>rocket</b> <b>engines</b> or hybrid <b>rocket</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R

25|$|A typical <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> {{can handle}} a {{significant}} fraction of its own mass in propellant each second, with the propellant leaving the nozzle at several kilometres per second. This means that the thrust-to-weight ratio of a <b>rocket</b> <b>engine,</b> and often the entire vehicle can be very high, in extreme cases over 100. This compares with other jet propulsion engines that can exceed 5 {{for some of the}} better engines.|$|E

In that case the thrust-to-weight ratio of the <b>rocket</b> <b>engine</b> limits the maximum acceleration that can be designed. It turns out that rocket engines generally have truly excellent thrust to weight ratios (137 for the NK-33 engine, some solid rockets are over 1000), and nearly all really high-g vehicles employ or have employed rockets.|$|E
