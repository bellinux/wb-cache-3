5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly {{as they are}} exposed to full sunlight when on the nest. They <b>ruffle</b> feathers to lift them away from the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Bonaparte first {{appears on}} the ship of dogs being transported from Cuba to Haiti in Part Two of the novel. She is {{described}} as a beautiful woman who, despite her tender years, is familiar with the male body. She enjoyed tempting the men on board and for that reason would let the wind <b>ruffle</b> her hair and breeze through her clothes to reveal the grace of her breasts. She would also sleep out in the open. Pauline has Solimán massage her body and tend to her beauty. They form a relationship and when her husband, Leclerc, falls ill she puts her faith in the voodoo of Solimán designed to cure him. Leclerc dies and Pauline makes her way back to Paris.|$|E

Including face-to-face interviews with a number individuals concerned with the windfarm, it focused primarily on Rachel <b>Ruffle,</b> project manager for RES, and Mike Hulme, local resident and member of DBJRG. Initially conceived as a single film, it developed into a series as the planning process became more and more protracted. The timescale also consumed most of the programme budget, with producer Jeremy Gibson eventually completing the films as a solo project. The series was first broadcast in May and June 2011.|$|E

Her hood {{was large and}} round and red but not smooth, — it was corrugated; that is to say, it consisted {{of a series of}} rolls nearly as large as my arm, passing over her head sidewise, growing smaller toward the back until they terminated in a big button that was embellished with a knot of green ribbon. Its general appearance was not unlike that of the familiar, pictorial beehive except that the rolls were not arranged spirally. The broad, white <b>ruffle</b> of her lace cap projected several inches beyond the front of the hood and waved back and forth like the single leaves of a great white poppy, as she nodded emphatically in her discourse.|$|E
25|$|Cockatoo {{species have}} a mobile crest of {{feathers}} {{on the top}} of their heads, which they can raise for display, and retract. No other parrots can do so, but the Pacific lorikeets in the genera Vini and Phigys can <b>ruffle</b> the feathers of the crown and nape, and the red-fan parrot (or hawk-headed parrot) has a prominent feather neck frill that it can raise and lower at will. The predominant colour of plumage in parrots is green, though most species have some red or another colour in small quantities. Cockatoos are the main exception to this, having lost the green and blue plumage colours in their evolutionary history; they are now predominately black or white with some red, pink, or yellow. Strong sexual dimorphism in plumage is not typical among parrots, with some notable exceptions, the most striking being the eclectus parrot. However {{it has been shown that}} some parrot species exhibit sexually dimorphic plumage in the ultraviolet spectrum, normally invisible to humans.|$|E
50|$|Membrane <b>ruffling</b> (also {{known as}} cell <b>ruffling)</b> is the {{formation}} of a motile cell surface that contains a meshwork of newly polymerized actin filaments. It can also be {{regarded as one of the}} earliest structural changes observed in the cell. The GTP-binding protein Rac is the regulator of this membrane <b>ruffling.</b> Changes in the Polyphosphoinositide metabolism and changes in Ca2+ level of the cell may also play an important role. A number of actin-binding and organizing proteins localize to membrane <b>ruffles</b> and potentially target to transducing molecules.|$|R

40|$|Membrane <b>ruffling</b> of a tumour cell is {{correlated}} with its motile and metastatic behaviour. This {{study examined the}} effect of gamma linolenic acid (GLA), an anti-cancer agent, on HGF/SF induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> in the human cancer cell line, HT 115. HGF induced a rapid appearance of membrane <b>ruffling</b> which was related to increased motility and the tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation of ezrin, a membrane-cytoskeleton linker protein. The presence of GLA significantly inhibited both the membrane <b>ruffling</b> and cell motility of the tumour cells, at sub-toxic concentrations. Western blotting revealed that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin was inhibited by GLA. The translocation ezrin from cytosol and generalised areas of cell membrane to <b>ruffled</b> areas of the membrane induced by HGF/SF was also inhibited as shown by both indirect immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. It is concluded that GLA inhibits HGF/SF induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> via its effect on ezrin, and this provides a further molecular explanation for the anti-tumour action of GLA...|$|R
40|$|In murine macrophages stimulated with Macrophage-Colony-stimulating Factor (M-CSF), signals {{essential}} to macropinosome formation {{are restricted to}} the domain of plasma membrane enclosed within cup-shaped, circular <b>ruffles.</b> Consistent with a role for these actin-rich structures in signal amplification, microscopic measures of Rac 1 activity determined that disruption of actin polymerization by latrunculin B inhibited <b>ruffling</b> and the localized activation of Rac 1 in response to M-CSF. To test the hypothesis that circular <b>ruffles</b> restrict the lateral diffusion of membrane proteins that are essential for signaling, we monitored diffusion of membrane-tethered, photoactivatable green fluorescent protein (PAGFP-MEM) in <b>ruffling</b> and non-ruffling regions of cells. Although diffusion within macropinocytic cups was not inhibited, circular <b>ruffles</b> retained photoactivated PAGFP-MEM inside cup domains. Confinement of membrane molecules by circular <b>ruffles</b> could explain how actin facilitates positive feedback amplification of Rac 1 in these relatively large domains of plasma membrane, thereby organizing the contractile activities that close macropinosomes. Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, we demonstrate that macropinosome formation is directed by a sequence of chemical changes within the cups of plasma membrane circular <b>ruffles.</b> Stages of receptor-dependent signaling were organized into distinct transient waves of phosphoinositides, diacylglycerol, PKCα, Rac and Ras activities, which preceded cup closure and peak recruitment of Rab 5 to macropinosomes. Thus, circular <b>ruffles</b> enclose plasma membrane subdomains that focus receptor signal amplification and the signal transitions that coordinate cell movements...|$|R

500|$|Purcell {{joined with}} story editor Dan Smith from Canadian studio Nelvana {{to create an}} {{animated}} television series of Sam & Max in 1996. The result was the 1997 series , broadcast on Fox Kids in the United States, YTV in Canada and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Purcell wrote the jokes for each installment of the 24-episode series, and wrote the scripts for four episodes. Despite the toned-down violence and mild profanity common in the Sam & Max franchise due to the target audience of children, Purcell was content that the characters maintained their moral ambiguity. Some parent groups in the United States attempted to have the series pulled from networks due to content issues; Purcell was pleased that they [...] "had managed to <b>ruffle</b> some feathers along the way". Two Sam & Max comic strips appeared in Fox's Totally Fox Kids Magazine in 1998 to accompany the series; other Sam & Max strips appeared in Wizard and Oni Double Feature. During {{the development of the}} television series in 1997, Purcell co-authored and illustrated the Hellboy Christmas Special with Mike Mignola and Gary Gianni. After the conclusion of the Sam & Max animated series, Purcell was briefly employed by Industrial Light & Magic to work on digital effects for a film version of Frankenstein. Despite his work, the project was canceled; Purcell believes that some of the development work morphed into ILM's contributions to Van Helsing. While at ILM, Purcell was involved in a project to create an animated film based on Monkey Island; while the project did not reach fruition, Purcell began posting concept art he had produced for the film on his personal blog several years after.|$|E

40|$|Shigella {{deliver a}} subset of effectors into the host cell via the type III {{secretion}} system, that stimulate host cell signal pathways to modulate the actin dynamics required for invasion of epithelial cells. Here we show {{that one of the}} Shigella effectors, called VirA, can interact with tubulin to promote microtubule (MT) destabilization, and elicit protrusions of membrane <b>ruffling.</b> Under in vitro conditions, VirA inhibited polymerization of tubulin and stimulated MT destabilization. Upon microinjection of VirA into HeLa cells, a localized membrane <b>ruffling</b> was induced rapidly. Overexpression of VirA in host cells caused MT destruction and protruding membrane <b>ruffles</b> which were absent when VirA was co-expressed with a dominant-negative Rac 1 mutant. Indeed, Shigella but not the virA mutant stimulated Rac 1, including the formation of membrane <b>ruffles</b> in infected cells. Importantly, the MT structure beneath the protruding <b>ruffling</b> was destroyed. Furthermore, drug-induced MT growth in HeLa cells greatly enhanced the Shigella entry. These results indicate that VirA is a novel type of bacterial effector capable of inducing membrane <b>ruffling</b> through the stimulation of MT destabilization...|$|R

40|$|IL- 2 {{is known}} to play a {{critical}} role in regulating T lymphocyte proliferation. We show here that IL- 2 also provokes an instantaneous and sustained membrane <b>ruffling</b> in cloned human or murine T cells as well as in lectin-activated peripheral blood lymphocytes. In the IL- 2 -induced lamellipodia, tubulin is depolymerized whereas actin is strongly polymerized, forming caps. IL- 2 -induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> is protein kinase C (PKC) independent, as judged by the absence of effects of bisindolylmaleimide, an efficient inhibitor of all PKC isoforms. The formation of lamellipodia by IL- 2 is blocked by wortmannin and LY 294002, two inhibitors of phosphoinositide 3 -kinase (PI 3 -kinase). Moreover, expression in murine T cells of an inactive form of P 13 -kinase inhibits IL- 2 -induced membrane <b>ruffling,</b> whereas expression of a constitutively active p 110 increases the basal membrane <b>ruffling.</b> Rac is also involved in IL- 2 -induced membrane <b>ruffling</b> since an inactive form of Rac (N 17 rac) blocks the IL- 2 -induced lamellipodia, whereas the constitutive form of Rac (Val 12 rac) can also lead to membrane <b>ruffling.</b> In the signaling cascade, Rac is downstream of PI 3 -kinase since constitutive membrane <b>ruffling</b> in Val 12 rac cells is insensitive to wortmannin. Thus, through a signaling cascade involving PI 3 -kinase and Rac, IL- 2 can induce profound alterations of the T cell cytoskeleton, a phenomenon which might be of importance for T cell physiology...|$|R
