50|$|Several countries, {{including}} Japan, Switzerland, {{and previously}} Spain and Germany, are using or {{have used the}} <b>reprocessing</b> <b>services</b> offered by BNFL and COGEMA. Here, the fission products, minor actinides, activation products, and reprocessed uranium are separated from the reactor-grade plutonium, which can then be fabricated into MOX fuel. Because {{the proportion of the}} non-fissile even-mass isotopes of plutonium rises with each pass through the cycle, there are currently no plans to reuse plutonium from used MOX fuel for a third pass in a thermal reactor. However, if fast reactors become available, {{they may be able to}} burn these, or almost any other actinide isotopes.|$|E
40|$|For many years, the {{commercial}} nuclear business has remained relatively stable in many ways. That {{is unlikely to}} be the case in the coming years. While some countries have called for the phase out of nuclear power and others have ordered a small number of new plants, the overall profile of the nuclear power business has changed little. The number of countries with nuclear power plants is not much different than 10 years ago and the total number of operating plants has increased only slightly. Commercial enrichment and <b>reprocessing</b> <b>services</b> have remained the province of a few countries and consortia. Repository programs have moved forward slowly in some cases, backward in others, with a very small number making substantial progress. We are now witnessing the beginnings of serious change, with significant consequences for the future nuclear regime. Business as usual will not be the business of the future. The way the nuclear and policy community respond will {{have much to do with}} energy adequacy, national security, international stability, and environmental consequences including waste management and disposal. A number of events and trends are becoming increasingly apparent and are cause for both opportunity and caution: (1) New nuclear power plant orders are likely to grow and spread, particularly in the developing world, e. g. China and India. (2) The growing recognition that the developing world will be a major competitor for limited energy resources is raising awareness in the developed world regarding concerns for future energy security. (3) Clearer evidence of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions on global warming, largely from the burning of fossil fuels, is creating more attention on the environmental benefits of nuclear power. (4) The last decade has shown unequivocal evidence of countries lying, cheating on their NPT obligation, and covertly carrying out nuclear weapons-related activities. Some countries have suggested their presumed need for a domestic nuclear fuel cycle as a rationale to pursue enrichment and/or reprocessing capabilities, which would move them to the doorstep of being nuclear weapons capable. The DPRK even took the action to abrogate the NPT to hold on to its nuclear weapons program. (5) 9 / 11 and other evidence have made it undeniable that terrorist groups would like to obtain weapons of mass destruction, particularly nuclear weapons, and would use them if they could. A number of initiatives have been proposed recently to allow for the growth and spread of nuclear power while limiting the justifications for additional countries to pursue the acquisition of enrichment or reprocessing capabilities. Enrichment or reprocessing are the only ways for countries to gain the indigenous capability to transform natural materials and fuel for and from nuclear power plants to directly weapons-usable materials...|$|E
50|$|In the United States it {{is normal}} to use fuel {{once in a}} power reactor before placing it in a waste store. The long term plan is {{currently}} to place the used civilian reactor fuel in a deep store. This non-reprocessing policy was started in March 1977 {{because of concerns about}} nuclear weapons proliferation. President Jimmy Carter issued a Presidential directive which indefinitely suspended the commercial reprocessing and recycling of plutonium in the United States. This directive was likely an attempt by the United States to lead other countries by example, but many other nations continue to reprocess spent nuclear fuels. The Russian government under President Vladimir Putin repealed a law which had banned the import of used nuclear fuel, which makes it possible for Russians to offer a <b>reprocessing</b> <b>service</b> for clients outside Russia (similar to that offered by BNFL).|$|R
40|$|The remelting-restabilization {{technique}} {{was applied to}} evaluate the closed loop recycling of post-used, white garden chairs made from filled polypropylene (PP). Different commercial stabilization systems in selected concentrations were employed to investigate the optimum restabilization recipe for eliminating degradation effects during <b>reprocessing</b> and successive <b>service</b> life. For monitoring the processing stability of the restabilized and non-restabilized material, a multiple extrusion procedure at two different reprocessing temperatures was performed. In addition, mechanical tests were carried out, for further studying the effect of restabilization {{on the performance of}} the recycled material. The long-term thermal stability of the recycled material was studied by mechanical tests and by determining the time to embrittlement in accelerated heat ageing experiments. The results lead to conclusions about the success of restabilization for quality improvement of post-used filled PP chair material during recycling, permitting its re-use in the original application...|$|R
40|$|Reprocessing of used {{products}} {{is a growing}} field, with respect to both scientific and practical approaches. In this context, we present an in-depth case study dealing with the reverse logistics processes at Repair- and Service Center R. U. S. Z, an Austrian Work Integration Social Enterprise (WISE) located in Vienna, Austria. The main business segments of R. U. S. Z are <b>reprocessing,</b> repairing, and <b>servicing</b> of (used) products and repair services. The reverse logistics activities include relevant processes like acquisition, testing and grading, and disposition/reprocessing of used goods. Based upon the case study, we present the gained insights and furthermore identify research opportunities. Our main findings are: (1) the reverse logistics activities of this non-profit-organization are equivalent compared with the profit-driven approaches used in literature; (2) the business of R. U. S. Z is not solely profit- or cost-driven but the company {{is based on the}} triple bottom line and pursues environmental and social goals, too; (3) in spite of legislation aiming at the reuse of used products, there is lack of collaboration between manufacturers and reprocessors...|$|R
40|$|The initial {{cleaning}} of reusable surgical devices {{is critical to}} ensure {{the efficacy of the}} subsequent sterilisation process. Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are incurable and fatal neurodegenerative diseases apparently transmitted simply by the absorption or ingestion of self-aggregating protease-resistant prions (PrP(Sc)), which are very resilient to most standard cleaning chemistries and heat-based decontamination techniques. Therefore there is a risk of iatrogenic transmission from reusable surgical devices if these are allowed to retain potentially infectious material after standard <b>reprocessing</b> through sterile <b>service</b> departments (SSDs). We aimed to assess the current state of surgical instrument decontamination with the collaboration of anonymous SSDs. Surgical stainless steel surfaces were spiked with prion-infected brain homogenates, and episcopic differential interference contrast/epifluorescence (EDIC/EF) microscopy was applied to quantify the amount of residual prion amyloid and other proteins remaining after decontamination with enzymatic cleaners currently employed by SSDs. Reusable instruments deemed 'clean and ready to use' were also stained for comparison with our findings in the laboratory. All cleaning chemistries were only partially effective under the recommended conditions. More importantly, PrP(Sc) constituted the main fraction of the remaining contamination left on these surfaces. The neurosurgery instruments also harboured amyloid and general protein contamination. This study shows that currently marketed cleaning chemistries and recent decontamination protocols do not completely suppress the threat from iatrogenic CJD. These findings should be taken into account for risk assessment purposes and re-evaluating instrument handling and decontamination practices...|$|R
40|$|Author(s) 2016. The {{technical}} steps {{involved in}} configuring a regional ocean model are analogous for all community models. All require {{the generation of}} a model grid, preparation and interpolation of topography, initial conditions, and forcing fields. Each task in configuring a regional ocean model is straightforward - but the process of downloading and reformatting data can be time-consuming. For an experienced modeller, the configuration of a new model domain can take {{as little as a}} few hours - but for an inexperienced modeller, it can take much longer. In pursuit of technical efficiency, the Australian ocean modelling community has developed the Web-based MARine Virtual Laboratory (WebMARVL). WebMARVL allows a user to quickly and easily configure an ocean general circulation or wave model through a simple interface, reducing the time to configure a regional model to a few minutes. Through WebMARVL, a user is prompted to define the basic options needed for a model configuration, including the model, run duration, spatial extent, and input data. Once all aspects of the configuration are selected, a series of data extraction, <b>reprocessing,</b> and repackaging <b>services</b> are run, and a "take-away bundle" is prepared for download. Building on the capabilities developed under Australia's Integrated Marine Observing System, WebMARVL also extracts all of the available observations for the chosen time-space domain. The user is able to download the take-away bundle and use it to run the model of his or her choice. Models supported by WebMARVL include three community ocean general circulation models and two community wave models. The model configuration from the take-away bundle is intended to be a starting point for scientific research. The user may subsequently refine the details of the model set-up to improve the model performance for the given application. In this study, WebMARVL is described along with a series of results from test cases comparing WebMARVL-configured models to observations and manually configured models. It is shown that the automatically configured model configurations produce a good starting point for scientific research...|$|R
