40|$|Abstract. The {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) technique is employed to predict the flow of quenchant in a large quench tank. The characteristics of flow field in the existing quench tank are investigated, and the major deficiency occurred in the tank structure design is analyzed. Two different schemes for improving the tank structure design are brought forward, and further numerical simulations are carried out. Results show that the non-uniform flow field is generated throughout the quenching zone in the existing large quench tank. There is clear difference in flow rate in the regions near the inner surface of workpiece and the outer, which may cause the workpiece distortion and even cracking. Reduction in <b>ring</b> <b>pipe</b> intermediate diameter can not obviously enhance the uniformity of flow field in the quench tank. By adding an inner core in the center zone of the tank, the flow rate in the region near the inner surface of workpiece can be increased effectively, and the flow rate difference found in the quenching zone reduced significantly, which are beneficial to guarantee the quenching quality of workpiece...|$|E

The medical facilities are located in separate buildings connected with a <b>ring</b> <b>pipe</b> warm water system. All L. pneumophila serogroup 6 strains isolated from the warm water supply reacted with a serogroup-specific monoclonal antibody, but not with two other monoclonal antibodies which are subgroup specific, reacting with other serogroup 6 strains. The NolI genomic profiles obtained by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of 25 serogroup 6 strains isolated from the Dental Faculty over a 3 -year period, 1 isolate from the Internal Medicine Clinic, and 4 strains from the Surgery Clinic were identical. Furthermore, all these strains hybridized with a 3 OO-kb NolI fragment when a legiolysin (lIy) -specific DNA probe was used. The NolI pattern, however, differed from those of six serogroup 6 strains of other origins, one serogroup 12 strain from the bacteriological unit, and another six unrelated strains of serogroups other than serogroup 6.

This paper classifies {{the tunnel}} frost damages and {{discusses}} their causes, especially {{the causes of}} lining structural damage for freezing and they are classified into two categories: the outer freezing damage and the inner freezing damage of lining. The analysis shows that the former has a {{little effect on the}} structure, but the latter has big threat. For the phenomenon that cracks frequently occur in the tunnel lining of cold regions, some measures to prevent cracks are presented, including reducing adverse constraints in the process of temperature change and preventing large temperature stress. In cold regions, it is unsuitable to adopt back paste-type water-stops to prevent the leakage from lining construction joints, and a good choice is to utilize the buried drainage water-stops. The <b>ring</b> drainage <b>pipes</b> directly connect with the central drainage pipe, and thermal insulating layer with belt shape is set along the <b>ring</b> drainage <b>pipes</b> in some sections where surrounding rock is water-rich and the middle and lower part of the <b>ring</b> drainage <b>pipe</b> are easily frozen.

Since an experimental approach is essential for implementing validated optimization software, the TPG research team of the University of Genoa has installed a laboratory facility for carrying out studies on polygeneration grids. The facility consists of two co-generation prime movers based on conventional technology: a 100 kWe gas turbine (mGT) and a 20 kWe internal combustion engine (ICE). The rig high flexibility allows the possibility of integration with renewable-source based devices, such as biomass-fed boilers and solar panels. Special attention was devoted to thermal distribution grid design.

40|$|Ring {{instability}} is an impulsive deformation that progresses. At worst, instability is <b>ring</b> collapse. Buried <b>pipes</b> can invert only if {{the ring}} deflects and the soil slips at the same time. Instability of buried pipes is analyzed as a soil-structure interaction. Ring stiffness resists inversion; soil supports the ring to keep it close to circular shape. The present paper demonstrates the basic manners of ring instability for buried flexible <b>pipes,</b> <b>ring</b> deformation and buckling at yield stress. The analysis found that if the pipe is {{to be subjected to}} vacuum {{it is very important to}} limit ring deflection to 5 %. Because it increases the maximum vacuum to be larger than atmospheric pressure, therefore the pipe would not collapse. If the pipe is so flexible ring stiffness cannot be support any of the soil load. With 8 % ring deflection, the vacuum at collapse is,- 0. 55 bar with neglect term, Ed/rn 3, for ring stiffness. For the design of pipes to withstand internal vacuum, a safety factor of 1. 5 is recommended. It is prudent to require that embedment soil be denser than critical. Critical density can be evaluated in the soils laboratory. Even without a water table, percolating water and earth tremors tend to shake loose soil do such that ring deflection could increase and reduce internal vacuum at collapse...|$|R

This paper examines how the hyperbolic constitutive law {{can be applied to}} characterize nonlinear stress-strain behavior {{of cast iron}} used in water supply networks. Procedures are described to obtain parameters of the hyperbolic constitutive law from either the response (data) obtained from simple uniaxial tensile and compressive tests or from bending tests. To demonstrate its applicability, this hyperbolic constitutive law is first applied to data obtained from uniaxial tensile and compressive tests conducted by Schlick and Moore (1936, Strength and Elastic Properties of Cast Iron in Tension, Compression, Flexure, and Combined Tension and Flexure, Bulletin 127, Iowa Engineering Experiment Station, Ames, IA). In addition, an approach to extract parameters for the hyperbolic constitutive law from bending (beam and <b>pipe</b> <b>rings)</b> tests is proposed and subsequently applied to tests conducted by Talbot (1908, Tests of Cast-Iron and Reinforced Concrete Culvert Pipe, Bulletin No. 22, University of Illinois, Urbana, IL).

Detailed material properties for the alloy used are necessary for the analysis. The solution of the geometrically andphysically nonlinear problem is achieved by application of a Newton'smethod in which a sequence of linear problems is numerically solved. Due to consistent linearization, a quadratic rate of convergence is obtained. Several test cases are presented to illustrate the potential of the finite element procedure.

5000|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering a bracket is any intermediate component for fixing one part to another, usually larger, part. What makes a bracket a bracket {{is that it}} is intermediate between the two and fixes the one to the other. Brackets vary widely in shape, but a prototypical bracket is the L-shaped metal piece that attaches a shelf (the smaller component) to a wall (the larger component): its vertical arm is fixed to one (usually large) element, and its horizontal arm protrudes outwards and holds another (usually small) element. This shelf bracket is effectively the same as the architectural bracket: a vertical arm mounted on the wall, and a horizontal arm projecting outwards for another element to be attached on top of it or below it. To enable the outstretched arm to support a greater weight, a bracket will often have a third arm running diagonally between the horizontal and vertical arms, or indeed the bracket may be a solid triangle. By extension almost any object that performs this function of attaching one part to another (usually larger) component is also called a bracket, even though it may not be obviously L-shaped. Common examples that are often not really L-shaped at all but attach a smaller component to a larger and are still called brackets are the components that attach a bicycle lamp to a bicycle, and the <b>rings</b> that attach <b>pipes</b> to walls.|$|R
