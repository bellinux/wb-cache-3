5|$|A 2012 {{study by}} Schott and David C. Evans {{found that the}} number {{and shape of the}} {{individual}} nodes on the squamosal shelf of the examined S. validum skulls varied considerably, and that this variability does not seem to correlate with ontogenic changes, but was due to individual variation. These <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> no correlation between the width of supratemporal fenestrae {{and the size of the}} squamosal.|$|E
5|$|Because {{submarines}} at {{the surface}} could see the dark shape of an attacking aircraft against the night sky, the principle of diffused lighting camouflage also applied to aircraft. However, British <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> {{that the amount of}} electrical power required to camouflage an aircraft's underside in daylight was prohibitive, while externally mounted light projectors disturbed the aircraft's aerodynamics.|$|E
5|$|In November 2017, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> genomic {{evidence}} for a new species of orangutan named, Pongo tapanuliensis, found only in the Batang Toru forest of Sumatra, Indonesia. It is estimated that fewer than 800 individuals still exist, which puts the Tapanuli orangutan among the most endangered of great apes.|$|E

5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that mockingbirds {{were able to}} recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized the intruder and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> {{that there}} were 4,822 {{same-sex}} couples in the District of Columbia in 2010; about 2% of total households. Legislation authorizing same-sex marriage passed in 2009 and the District began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples in March 2010.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of small}} and large fish in the local economy was analyzed. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> that while the less common large fish are sold for profit, the diet of Pak Mun villagers {{consisted}} mostly of small fish which can be caught in both the wet and dry seasons. Small fish are eaten, sold, and traded with the hill peoples for rice.|$|E

5|$|INGEMMET (Instituto Geológico Minero y Metalúrgico) of Peru {{released}} internally on September 21 {{a report}} on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: pyroxene (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, pyroxene (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of chromite and native copper. Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites.|$|E
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing his path to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Insect {{damage to}} the fossilized leaves of {{flowering}} plants from fourteen sites in North America were used {{as a proxy for}} insect diversity across the K–Pg boundary and analyzed to determine the rate of extinction. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> that Cretaceous sites, prior to the extinction event, had rich plant and insect-feeding diversity. During the early Paleocene, however, flora were relatively diverse with little predation from insects, even 1.7million years after the extinction event.|$|E

5|$|Longrich et al. {{pointed out}} that the robust forelimbs and {{enlargement}} of a single finger in ingeniine oviraptorids is similar to that seen in modern animals that eat ants and termites, such as anteaters and pangolins, but the morpholology of ingeniine jaws does not support them being insectivorous. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that the function of ingeniine forelimbs was unclear, but suggested that they could have been used for scratching, tearing, or digging, though not prey capture.|$|E
5|$|<b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> {{out that}} very weak {{electromagnetic}} fields disrupt the magnetic compass used by European robins and other songbirds to navigate using the Earth's magnetic field. Neither power lines nor cellphone signals {{are to blame}} for the electromagnetic field effect on the birds, according to the new study published in the 8 May 2014 edition of the journal Nature. Instead, the culprits consist of frequencies between 2kHz and 5MHz, such as AM radio signals and ordinary electronic equipment that might be found in businesses or private homes.|$|E
5|$|The {{hypothesis}} {{was that the}} silver iodide would cause supercooled water in the storm to freeze, disrupting the inner structure of the hurricane. This led to the seeding of several Atlantic hurricanes. However, it was later shown that this {{hypothesis was}} incorrect. It was determined that most hurricanes do not contain enough supercooled water for cloud seeding to be effective. Additionally, <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that unseeded hurricanes often undergo the same structural changes that were expected from seeded hurricanes. This finding called Stormfury's successes into question, as the changes reported now had a natural explanation.|$|E

5|$|The nuclear {{properties}} of plutonium-239 were also studied; <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> {{that when it}} is hit by a neutron it breaks apart (fissions) by releasing more neutrons and energy. These neutrons can hit other atoms of plutonium-239 and so on in an exponentially fast chain reaction. This can result in an explosion large enough to destroy a city if enough of the isotope is concentrated to form a critical mass.|$|E
5|$|This bird may {{sometimes}} join mixed-species feeding flocks in winter, {{but it does}} not appear to share the resources found by accompanying tits and goldcrests, and may just be benefiting from the extra vigilance of a flock. Wood ants share the same habitat as the treecreeper, and also feed on invertebrates on tree trunks. The Finnish <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that where the ants have been foraging, there are fewer arthropods, and male treecreepers spent a shorter time on spruce trunks visited by ants.|$|E
5|$|A study {{conducted}} at the Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS), at the University of California, Davis (UC Davis) published in 2014 found that many car dealers are less than enthusiastic about plug-in vehicles. ITS conducted 43 interviews with six automakers and 20 new car dealers selling plug-in vehicles in California’s major metro markets. The study also analyzed national and state-level J.D. Power 2013 Sales Satisfaction Index (SSI) study data on customer satisfaction with new car dealerships and Tesla retail stores. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that buyers of plug-in electric vehicles were significantly less satisfied and rated the dealer purchase experience much lower than buyers of non-premium conventional cars, while Tesla Motors earned industry-high scores. According to the findings, plug-in buyers expect more from dealers than conventional buyers, including product knowledge and support that extends beyond traditional offerings.|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is the translation analysis of colloquial expressions in subtitle of Dirty Grandpa movie. The objectives of this research are to analyze the types colloquial expression, the translation technique applied by the translator and the relationship between the translation techniques and the translation acceptability in the subtitle text of Dirty Grandpa movie. The data were obtained by using content analysis and questionnaire. In content analysis, the researcher collected the data by selecting the dialogues among the characters in the Dirty Grandpa movie containing colloquial expressions. The questionnaire was distributed to the raters to be given a score and evaluated the acceptability for the data. From the analysis, the <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> 276 colloquial expressions. There are four types of colloquial expression; single words, clipped words, contractions, and verb- adverb combinations. In this analysis, the <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> 8 (eight) translation techniques used by the translator to translate colloquial expressions. There are amplification, borrowing, calque, establish equivalence, linguistic compression, literal translation, reduction, and transposition. 276 data are acceptable level, 40 data are less acceptable level and 2 data are unacceptable level. The <b>researcher</b> <b>found</b> 85 % data are acceptable, 14 % data are less acceptable and 1 % data are unacceptable...|$|R

5|$|According to the US Department of Agriculture (USDA), {{the total}} number of animals used in the US during 2015 was 820,812, down from almost 1.2 million in 2005, however, this number does not include rats and mice, which make up around 90% of {{research}} animals. By comparing with EU data, where all vertebrate species are counted, Speaking of Research estimated that around 12 million vertebrates were used in research in the US in 2016. A 2015 article published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, argued that the use of animals in the US has dramatically increased in recent years. <b>Researchers</b> <b>found</b> this increase is largely the result of an increased reliance on genetically modified mice in animal studies.|$|E
5|$|As weather {{conditions}} shift due to climate change, bees change their behaviors. When it rains, bees {{do not go}} out and during extremely hot weather they try to gather water to keep the colony cool. Climatologists have predicted that the occurrence of extreme weather events (such as intense rainy seasons and prolonged drought) will increase as the climate continues to change. Additionally, in regions that experience increasingly more rain, pollen will be washed away more easily {{making it more difficult}} for bees to provide for their colonies. Meanwhile, in environments experiencing prolonged drought, flower environments may dwindle with dry weather. These patterns lead to less suitable and viable environments in which bees can thrive. A British journal published projections of plant diversity loss against spatial sensitivity; the <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> major species loss {{in the southern part of}} the UK forcing bee colonies further north.|$|E
5|$|Based upon data {{taken from}} the United States using these methods, cirrus cloud cover was found to vary diurnally and seasonally. The <b>researchers</b> <b>found</b> that in the summer, at noon, the cover is the lowest, {{with an average of}} 23% of the United States' land area covered by cirrus. Around midnight, the cloud cover {{increases}} to around 28%. In winter, the cirrus cloud cover did not vary appreciably from day to night. These percentages include clear days and nights, as well as days and nights with other cloud types, as lack of cirrus cloud cover. When these clouds are present, the typical coverage ranges from 30% to 50%. Based on satellite data, cirrus covers an average of 20% to 25% of the Earth's surface. In the tropical regions, this cloud covers around 70% of the region's surface area.|$|E
