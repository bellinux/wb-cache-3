25|$|The {{respiratory}} system (also <b>respiratory</b> <b>apparatus,</b> ventilatory system) is a biological system consisting of specific organs and structures used for gas exchange in animals and plants. The {{anatomy and physiology}} that make this happen varies greatly, {{depending on the size}} of the organism, the environment in which it lives and its evolutionary history. In land animals the respiratory surface is internalized as linings of the lungs. Gas exchange in the lungs occurs in millions of small air sacs called alveoli in mammals and reptiles, but atria in birds. These microscopic air sacs have a very rich blood supply, thus bringing the air into close contact with the blood. These air sacs communicate with the external environment via a system of airways, or hollow tubes, of which the largest is the trachea, which branches in the middle of the chest into the two main bronchi. These enter the lungs where they branch into progressively narrower secondary and tertiary bronchi that branch into numerous smaller tubes, the bronchioles. In birds the bronchioles are termed parabronchi. It is the bronchioles, or parabronchi that generally open into the microscopic alveoli in mammals and atria in birds. Air has to be pumped from the environment into the alveoli or atria by the process of breathing which involves the muscles of respiration.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the past}} 50 years, {{hundreds}} {{of studies have}} described those cells that are characterized by a brush of rigid apical microvilli with long rootlets, and which {{are found in the}} digestive and <b>respiratory</b> <b>apparatuses.</b> These cells have been given names such as brush cells, tuft cells, fibrillovesicular cells, multivesicular cells and caveolated cells. More recently, it has been realized that all these elements may represent a single cell type, probably with a chemosensory role, even if other functions (e. g. secretory or absorptive) seem to be possible. Very recent developments have permitted a partial definition of the chemical code characterizing these elements, revealing the presence of molecules involved in chemoreceptorial cell signalling. A molecular cascade, similar to those characterizing the gustatory epithelium, seems to be present in these elements. These new data suggest that these elements can be considered solitary chemosensory cells with the presence of the apical ‘brush’ as an inconsistent feature.

The present study investigated in mice whether neutrophil recruitment to the lung leads to accumulation of plasma-derived host defense proteins in the alveolar space and whether respiratory burst contributes to this increase in permeability. Albumin, complement C 1 q, and IgM were increased in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid 6 h after intratracheal LPS challenge. Neutrophil depletion before LPS treatment completely prevented this increase in BAL fluid protein concentration. Respiratory burst was not detected in neutrophils isolated from BAL fluid, and BAL proteins were increased in mice deficient in a key subunit of the <b>respiratory</b> burst <b>apparatus,</b> gp 91 phox, similar to wild-type mice. Neutrophil recruitment elicited by intratracheal instillation of the chemokines macrophage inflammatory protein- 2 and keratinocyte-derived chemokine was also accompanied by accumulation of albumin, C 1 q, and IgM.

40|$|Ten {{persons were}} {{in need of}} help after a fire started along the main road in Kiruna {{underground}} mine. They were located at different levels of the mine. The fire department’s capacity of handling underground fires was tested, but the rescue operation was still successful. An underground mine can consist of many and long drifts, and a fire underground differ from a fire in a building. Mainly it is the smoke and the reduced visibility that are the risks underground, and it is hard to predict the smoke spread. The purpose with this thesis is to combine the fire protection in an underground mine with a plausible rescue operation. This will be done by reviewing the relevance of the current regulations and evaluate the risks and possible measures. During the work five interviews have been performed and also four smoke spread simulations in LKAB:s mine in Kiruna where performed using the program Ventsim. Ventsim is a program that is used for simulating ventilation in a mine by building a virtual model of the drifts of the mine. The current fire protection in an underground mine primarily consists of rescue chambers, alarm, sprinkled areas, sectioning, education, handheld fire-extinguishers on all vehicles and possibly an internal fire rescue service. The majority of the fires in underground mines are fuel controlled, flashover are unlikely. A great part of the heat from the smoke is absorbed by the rock walls, the smoke is cooled, and mixes evenly over the cross section. The results showed that rescue operations in underground mines today are performed flexibly. A rescue operation demands a for example <b>respiratory</b> protection <b>apparatus</b> and personnel, and a guide is a valuable asset. Other risks during operations in underground mines are long access routes, a limited amount of air, smoke, communication, disorientation and spalling. For the simulations the heat release rates were assumed to be 1, 5, 15 and 30 MW to correspond to a heavy goods vehicle with incombustible load. The air velocity in the simulations was 2 m/s. The fires were located at three different locations in the mine. From the results it was investigated if and when the concentrations were below IDLH (Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health, 1200 ppm) and TGV (Ceiling value, 100 ppm). After the simulations it could be seen that connecting in- and out passages were of importance to dilute the smoke. At long distances from the fire the smoke can be so diluted that the CO-concentration is below TGV. To facilitate a rescue operation in an underground mine a measure could be sectioning, further a vehicle with its own <b>respiratory</b> protection <b>apparatus</b> can facilitate the rescue operation. By sectioning the mine some of the problems for the rescue personnel can be solved. A lower degree of exertion for rescue personnel, such as the method with a vehicle imply, means that breathing apparatus-teams according to AFS 2007 : 7 {{does not need to be}} used. The work method with a vehicle would also imply a more effective rescue operation. In order for mine personnel to be able to stay in the rescue chambers during the entire fire, these chambers need higher air capacity, since a fire in an HGV can last for a longer period of time.

50|$|Torsion {{occurs in}} two {{mechanistic}} stages. The first is muscular {{and the second}} is mutagenetic. The effects of torsion are primarily physiological - the organism develops an asymmetrical nature with the majority of growth occurring on the left side. This leads to the loss of right-paired appendages (e.g., ctenidia (comb-like <b>respiratory</b> <b>apparatus),</b> gonads, nephridia, etc.). Furthermore, the anus becomes redirected to the same space as the head. This is speculated to have some evolutionary function, as prior to torsion, when retracting into the shell, first the posterior end would get pulled in, and then the anterior. Now, the front can be retracted more easily, perhaps suggesting a defensive purpose.|$|E

Postgate's research formed the basis of worldwide research on these bacteria and their cytochromes, as well as the discovery of many new genera; sulphate reducers are now known to constitute a diverse biosphere of their own.|$|E
