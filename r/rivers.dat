5|$|In late 2014 {{and early}} 2015, <b>Rivers</b> briefly {{considered}} running {{to be the}} chair of Clark County, a new position created with the home rule charter that <b>Rivers</b> worked to pass. There is no official rule against serving both as the chair and a state senator, but there were concerns about Rivers' ability to balance the two offices. In December 2014, <b>Rivers</b> officially announced she would run for the office. On March 2, 2015, The Columbian reported <b>Rivers</b> would likely be withdrawing from the race later that week. That was confirmed when <b>Rivers</b> released a statement later that day that said <b>Rivers</b> {{would not be a}} candidate. <b>Rivers</b> cited the time commitment and desire to stay in the State Senate as reasons for her withdrawal. She was considered the front runner for the office.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} when the {{individually}} named <b>rivers</b> became known collectively as Bow Back <b>Rivers.</b> Charles Tween, writing {{on behalf of}} the Lee Conservancy, referred to them as both the Stratford Back <b>Rivers</b> and the Stratford Back Streams in 1905. The section {{to the west of the}} more recent City Mills Lock was labelled Bow Back River on a map of 1895, but had previously been part of Pudding Mill River. Powell, writing in 1973, still referred to them as the Stratford Back <b>Rivers.</b>|$|E

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Fort Donelson to Grant's army on February 16, the Tennessee and Cumberland <b>Rivers,</b> two major water routes in the Confederate west, became Union {{waterways}} for movement of troops and material.

5|$|By {{the end of}} 1927, the Michigan State Highway Department (MSHD) had {{designated}} a highway numbered M-7 between Three <b>Rivers</b> and Centreville.

At the time of the extension, all of M-7 was a gravel road. Later that year, the original segment between Three <b>Rivers</b> and Colon was paved, and the state extended the hard-surface route as far as Nottawa in 1937.|$|E

5|$|Dorset's diverse {{geography}} ensures it has {{an assortment}} of <b>rivers,</b> although a moderate annual rainfall coupled with rolling hills, means most are typically lowland in nature. Much of the county drains into three <b>rivers,</b> the Frome, Piddle and Stour which all flow to the sea in a south-easterly direction. The Frome and Piddle are chalk streams but the Stour, which rises in Wiltshire to the north, has its origins in clay soil. The River Avon, which flows mainly through Wiltshire and Hampshire, enters Dorset {{towards the end of}} its journey at Christchurch Harbour. The <b>rivers</b> Axe and Yeo, which principally drain the counties of Devon and Somerset respectively, have their sources in the north-west of the county. In the south-west, a number of small <b>rivers</b> run into the sea along the Dorset coastline; most notable of these are the Char, Brit, Bride and Wey.|$|E
5|$|During the ice ages of {{the last}} two million years the Tibetan plateau and the Himalayas have been covered by the {{expanded}} polar ice cap several times. As the ice moved it eroded the rock, filling the river canyons with gravel. In some sections the <b>rivers</b> have cut through the gravel and flow swiftly over bedrock, and in some areas large boulders have fallen into the <b>rivers</b> and formed rapids.|$|E
