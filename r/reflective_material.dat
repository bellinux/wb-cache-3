5|$|The film's locations, {{with the}} {{exception}} of scenes filmed at a museum and at a farmhouse, were built on the Montreal sound stage. Production designer James Chinlund and his crew built sets for The Fountain in a large warehouse in Montreal. The sets included the 16th century jungle settings and the bubble-shaped spacecraft containing the tree of life and its garden. The spacecraft set was placed against greenscreen, and the crew hung colored <b>reflective</b> <b>material,</b> which included green, black, gold, and silver, on three circular tracks around the set. One material would be moved into place instead of the heavy equipment, and with the other materials partitioned off, a light source was used with the preferred material. Silver was used for scenes in which the spacecraft moved through the stars, and gold was used for when it entered the nebula.|$|E
5|$|The passive visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} {{part of the}} design of the vehicle, and involve the use of high contrast patterns. Older ambulances (and those in developing countries) {{are more likely to have}} their pattern painted on, whereas modern ambulances generally carry retro-reflective designs, which reflects light from car headlights or torches. Popular patterns include 'checker board' (alternate coloured squares, sometimes called 'Battenburg', named after a type of cake), chevrons (arrowheads – often pointed towards the front of the vehicle if on the side, or pointing vertically upwards on the rear) or stripes along the side (these were the first type of retro-reflective device introduced, as the original <b>reflective</b> <b>material,</b> invented by 3M, only came in tape form). In addition to retro-reflective markings, some services now have the vehicles painted in a bright (sometimes fluorescent) yellow or orange for maximum visual impact. Fire Department-operated Ambulances are often painted similarly to their apparatuses for ease of identification and the fact that bright red is a very striking color appropriate for this type of vehicle.|$|E

25|$|It {{should also}} be noted that UK {{legislation}} considers all lights, reflectors and <b>reflective</b> <b>material</b> to be lights, and all items resembling special warning beacons (of any color) must be covered and not just disconnected (as this is a separate offence) while on the public highway. Similarly, no distinction is made between lights mounted on light bars and those mounted anywhere else on the vehicle (e.g. headlights, indicators, brake lights) - all are covered by the same regulations.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{measurement}} of light tubes efficiency in laboratory conditions during lighting by almost direct light rays. It also {{deals with the}} measurement of the spectral reflectance of the <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> available on the Czech market. The comparison of the efficiency of different light routes and also {{the determination of the}} spectral qualities of different <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> are the aims of this thesis. The light tubes were measured by means of the cubic integrator. The light source was moved and manoeuvred by means of the automatic goniophotometer. The light source flow was determined by the method of the zonal flows. The data were calculated in the Matlab programme. The evaluation is both in the graphic and in the numeric forms. The result of the thesis is both the comparison of the <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> for light tubes qualities, and the evaluation of efficiency of the assigned light routes. The optimal variant can be then selected during designing of the light tubes route according to the results of the measurements...|$|R
25|$|There were {{problems}} with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: Entire 4' × 11', 500-lb (1.2 × 3.4 m, 227kg) windowpanes detached from the building and crashed to the sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached 45mph (72km/h). Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT's Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research {{raised questions about the}} structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, <b>reflective</b> <b>material,</b> and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.|$|E
500|$|Front {{projection}} {{had been}} used in smaller settings before 2001, mostly for still photography or television production, using small still images and projectors. The expansive backdrops for the African scenes required a screen [...] tall and [...] wide, far larger than {{had been used}} before. When the <b>reflective</b> <b>material</b> was applied to the backdrop in [...] strips, variations at the seams of the strips led to visual artifacts; to solve this, the crew tore the material into smaller chunks and applied them in a random [...] "camouflage" [...] pattern on the backdrop. The existing projectors using [...] transparencies resulted in grainy images when projected that large, so the crew worked with MGM's special effects supervisor Tom Howard to build a custom projector using [...] transparencies, which required the largest water-cooled arc lamp available. The technique was used widely in the film industry afterwards until it was replaced by blue/green screen systems in the 1990s.|$|E
500|$|Observations by the {{orbiting}} Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially {{limited the}} planet's albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, {{making it a}} surprisingly dark object. (The geometric albedo has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b's upper cloud deck is either made of less <b>reflective</b> <b>material</b> than is Jupiter's, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth's dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between {{the top of its}} atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. [...] This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like red dwarfs ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests {{at the top of the}} stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic {{cells are}} often {{perceived}} as an ugly addition to glazing. Improvements could make photovoltaics more attractive for use in architecture, increasing the opportunities to generate electricity on the surfaces of buildings. This research demonstrates methods of integrating crystalline-silicon photovoltaic cells into decorative glazing. The aim was to explore {{the use of a}} combination of opaque, <b>reflective</b> and coloured <b>materials</b> with crystalline-silicon photovoltaic cells in glazing designs, to enhance appearance whilst maintaining good photovoltaic generation. Colour was incorporated through the use of Lumogen F dyes (BASF) added to the photovoltaic encapsulants Sylgard 184 (Dow Corning) and EVA (ethylene vinyl acetate: Solutia Vistasolar Fastcure 486. 00). The absorption and emission properties of these new material combinations were measured. The dyes degraded quickly under both accelerated and outdoor testing. Glazing designs were created that incorporated Lumogen dyes, plus opaque and <b>reflective</b> <b>materials.</b> The opaque and <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> were used to disguise the square photovoltaic cells. This demonstrated that crystalline-silicon photovoltaic cells could be assimilated into a wide variety of architectural glazing. <b>Reflective</b> <b>materials</b> and fluorescent dyes were shown to improve maximum electrical current from widely-spaced crystalline-silicon photovoltaic cells. Further work is recommended to establish durable material combinations for use with photovoltaics in decorative glazing. Leverhulme Trus...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{concerns with}} {{the processing of}} high <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> by using high brightness laser sources. The representive copper allows a holistic view on this topic in an abstract way and delivers possibilities prior and during the process to influence the process positively. The functionality of an optical diode is the key aspect, which protects the laser system against process abort and damages. The proof of functionality can be demonstrated under the boundary of the well known thermal induced focal shift. This is a general topic for high brightness laser. Further possibilities are developed to compensate this effects. Summarizing, a catalogue of process preliminaries and technical devices is prepared to improve the processing of high <b>reflective</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{spectral}} specular reflectance {{of conventional}} and novel <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> for solar concentrators is measured with an acceptance angle of 17. 5 mrad over the wavelength range 300 − 2500 nm at incidence angles 15 – 60 ° using a spectroscopic goniometry system. The same experimental setup {{is used to}} determine the spectral narrow-angle transmittance of semi-transparent materials for solar collector covers at incidence angles 0 – 60 °. In addition, the angle-resolved surface scattering of <b>reflective</b> <b>materials</b> is recorded by an area-scan CCD detector over the spectral range 350 – 1050 nm. A comprehensive summary, discussion, and interpretation of the results are included in the associated research article “Spectral reflectance, transmittance, and angular scattering of materials for solar concentrators” in Solar Energy Materials and Solar Cells...|$|R
