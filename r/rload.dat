40|$|Abstract — In {{the current}} environment, network {{operators}} {{are trying to}} cope with the significant increase in data traffic by adopting different solutions to expand their network capacity. One solution would be the convergence of next generation wireless networks (e. g., HSDPA, LTE and WiMAX) which involve the closely interworking of the existing 2 G/ 2. 5 G/ 3 G networks with the new next generation networks in terms of handover and network selection. However, as a result, the diversification in mobile devices and the heterogeneity of the wireless environment make the seamless always best connectivity of the mobile users a challenge for the service providers. To this extent, we propose <b>RLoad</b> a novel Reputation-based Load-balancing Network Selection Strategy for heterogeneous wireless environments built on top of the IEEE 802. 21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) standard. The proposed solution makes use of a reputation-based mechanism to select the most appropriate set of networks for the mobile user and a load balancing mechanism to distribute the traffic load among the networks by making use of the Multipath TCP (MPTCP) protocol.

40|$|The term Impedance is {{a general}} term which {{can be applied to}} any {{electrical}} ethnicity which impedes (obstruct) the flow of the current. Oliver Heaviside (1850 - 1925) coined Impedance definition, as well as many other terms of art in electromagnetic theory: Inductance, Admittance, Conductance, Permeability, Permittance (Susceptance), Reluctance, Electret. Oliver Heaviside also reformulated Maxwell's field equations in terms of electric and magnetic forces and energy flux, and independently co-formulated Vector Analysis, which is needed to express the impedance in coordinates. Impedance Matching was originally developed for electrical power, but can be applied to any other field where a form of energy (not necessarily electrical) is transferred between a source and a load. The first Impedance Matching concept in RF domain was related to Antenna Matching. Designing an antenna can be seen as matching the free space to a transmitter or a receiver. Impedance Matching is always performed between two specified terminations The main purpose of Impedance Matching is to match two different terminations (Rsource and <b>RLoad)</b> through a specific pass-band, without having control over stop-band frequencies. We may assume that component losses are negligible but parasitic effects need to be considered. Reactance and LC Resonance Reactance X {{is a measure of the}} opposition to the current of Capacitance C and Inductance L. Reactance is measured in ohms and varies with the frequency of the AC signal. Reactance takes two forms: Inductive (XL), and Capacitive (XC). XL = ω L = 2 π f L XC = 1 / (ω C) = 1 / (2 π f C) Where: ω is angular frequency, f is frequency, L is inductance, and C is capacitance. When the magnitudes of L reactance and C reactance are equal, the L-C pair resonates. At resonance the net reactance of a series-connected L-C circuit is zero (a short circuit), and the net reactance of a parallel-connected L-C circuit is infinite (an open circuit). The resonant frequency is getting by equating the magnitudes of the L and C reactances (XL = XC...|$|E

Both thes conditions lead to difficulties in daily {{activities such as}} reaching, gra ping etc. Loss of motor function can be improved or recovered via relevant target specific movement rehabilitation. This r search aims to d velop and evaluate an electromyography (EMG) biofeedback based virtual reality (VR) system targeted towards CP and stroke patients that could provide an engaging and effective way to practice and improve hand and arm motion functions. VR, which could provide a repetitive multimodal task­orient d r habilitation environment for patients to undertake elf-training in safety, is con id red to be a suitabl tool for medical health rehabilitation. Using EMG biofeedback in rehabilitation could provide pati nts with opportunities to improve their ability by ass ssing th ir muscle activity r spons and learning self-control of mov m nt during specific training tasks. Th syst m development incorporat s concepts f om motor learning, visual art and programming, and provid s visual and audio feedback that guides the us r' move­m nt to becom smoother and more fficient. Using compo ite multiple feedback in upp r limb r habilitation enables th individual with upp r limb probl m to per­ceiv similar r al-world p rformanc in th virtual world. Howev r, it i r cognised that such fe dback might cause information overload, 1 ading to the individual feel­ing confused and distract d during training. The necessity of involving healthy subject in f asibility tudies is also recognised. Therefore, thi study focuses on healthy subjects to investigate the effectiveness of separate function-specific fe d­back training exercises in order to overcome the information overload problem. Two s ts of xp riments based on 2 D display and 3 D display were carried out in thi research. A total of sixty healthy subjects participated in the experiments, thirty for the 2 D display tests and thirty for the 3 D display tests. The developed EMG biof edback based VR system provided the participants with position, orientation, and muscle activity response information. This allow d combined task-oriented multiple feedback which aimed to improve the performance in the virtual environment. In order to preempt {{and deal with the}} information overload problem, three prior individual fe dback pre-training game-like tasks were designed based on the distinctive functions of the individual VR interactive inter­faces (magnetic track r and EMG system). As in video games, where preparative modes are provided, and the player can learn the key functions and the game sce­nario through prior practice, so as to improve their performance in the full game. This allows the multimodal and multiform fe dback training exercises are broken down into individual function-specific feedback exercises. The training tasks were designed in the form of gam -like tasks, which could offer better motivation and allow easier hierarchical delivery. Candle lighting, ball balancing and cup grasping game-like tasks, which are position movement, orientation movement and muscle contraction pre-training tasks respectively, were designed based on th distinctive function of magnetic tracking and EMG systems. The balloon shooting main game, which is re-engineered ba ed on a tutorial provided by th XNA game studio, was developed for th multiform feedback training task. The d veloped game-like VR rehabilitation tasks could make th information from the biological level visible to participant with multimodal and multiform feedback. In both 2 D and 3 D display tests, th r are two experimental groups with pre-training prior to th main game and a control group with th main task only. The empirical results of both 2 D and 3 D display t t indicate that the developed EM G biofe d back based VR system and tasks are useful to improv the ability of ome of th upp r limb activitie, and th prior individual feedback pre-training tasks are h lpful for b tt r performance in the main multiform fe dback task. This tudy show d that the information ov <b>rload</b> occurring in th integrat d VR syst m with multiple forms of£ edback can b ov rcom with prop rly design pre -training tasks...|$|E
