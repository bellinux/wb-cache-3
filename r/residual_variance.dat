30|$|Measurement {{invariance}} (MI) {{in multiple}} group comparison may pertain to different parameters of psychological assessment (Chen 2008; Sass 2011). In {{the case of}} continuous observed variables, the following parameters are constrained to establish different levels of MI across groups: intercept parameters, factor loadings, and <b>residual</b> <b>variances.</b> Hence, {{in the case of}} continuous observed variables, four levels of MI are typically tested (see e.g. Widaman and Reise 1997): (1) configural, (2) weak or metric, (3) strong or scalar, and (4) strict. Configural MI means that the parameters (e.g., factor loadings, intercept parameters, and <b>residual</b> <b>variances)</b> in the measurement model are not constrained, but freely estimated in all groups. Weak (or metric) MI implies that the factor loadings are set equal in all groups. However, the intercept and <b>residual</b> <b>variances</b> are allowed to vary across groups. Strong (or scalar) MI is established if the factor loadings and intercept parameters are held equal in all groups. For identification purposes the means of latent factors is fixed to zero in one group (i.e., the reference group) and freely estimated in all remaining groups when testing for strong MI. Strict MI requires that researchers constrain all parameters in the measurement model. Hence, strict MI is established if the intercept parameters, factor loadings and <b>residual</b> <b>variances</b> are held equal in groups. From a psychometrical point of view, strong measurement invariance is sufficient to ensure that the same construct is measured in all groups and to compare the means of the latent factor across countries (Widaman and Reise 1997).|$|R

It was not possible to include the maternal effects in the models. All random effects were modelled by sixth order regression on Legendre polynomials. The models were compared by the likelihood ratio test, the Akaike's information criterion and the Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion. Best results were showed by the models R 210 and VF 5.

A total of 194, 628 yearling weight records from 625 sires were used in the analysis. The results supported the hypothesis of genetic heterogeneity of <b>residual</b> <b>variance</b> on YW in Nellore beef cattle and the opportunity of selection, measured through the genetic coefficient of variation of <b>residual</b> <b>variance</b> (0. 10 to 0. 12 for the two-step approach and 0. 17 for DHGLM, using an untransformed data set).
