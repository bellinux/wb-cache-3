40|$|In this paper, we {{have tested}} for {{volatility}} spillovers between stock returns and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> for six countries, namely the US, the UK, Japan, Germany, Canada and France. Our findings can be summarised as follows. (a) Evidence of spillovers from stock returns to exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> is found for all countries except Germany. These {{results suggest that}} the asset approach to exchange rate determination is valid when formulated in terms of the second moments of the exchange rate distribution for these countries. (b) The spillovers from stock returns to exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> are symmetric in nature. (c) Volatility spillovers from exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> to stock returns are insignificant for all countries. The non-presence of spillovers from exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> to stock returns is in line with previous research which has focused on the first moments of the relevant distributions. (d) The correlation coefficient between the EGARCH filtered stock returns and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> is negative and significant for all countries, indicating that there is a significant contemporaneous relationship between stock returns and exchange <b>rate</b> <b>changes.</b> (e) Volatility spillovers from stock returns spillovers to exchange rates have increased since the October 1987 crash, perhaps because financial markets have become more closely integrated during this period.

Nonetheless, Bethesda stated that Oblivion was not typical of Mature rated titles, and did not contain [...] "central themes of violence" [...] common to such titles. The response asserted that Bethesda's submission to the ESRB was [...] "full, accurate, and comprehensive," [...] following the forms and requirements published by the ESRB, and that nothing was withheld.

40|$|Abstract—The {{effective}} {{end-to-end transport}} of delay-sensitive voice data {{has long been}} a problem in multimedia networking.

30|$|As expected, all {{policies}} {{improve their}} VGoS values when {{the frequency of}} <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> decreases. This is directly noticeable in the performance achieved by the nonadaptive (NA) solution, {{which is based on}} dropping the call that causes congestion after a <b>rate</b> <b>change</b> (less <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> lead to less call dropping). The same observation is valid for the case of MC-new. Remember that MC-new could obtain the best blocking ratio for adapting the codecs of new calls at the entrance. Additionally, it can now also achieve a low dropping ratio when the frequency of <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> decreases, thus becoming one of the best policies considering all metrics (Figure 5 (a)).|$|R
3000|$|Nevertheless, the MC-rate+new {{shows the}} best VGoS under any {{frequency}} of <b>rate</b> <b>changes.</b> The only case {{when it is}} outperformed is for low number of participating STAs (Figure 5 (b)) and high frequency of <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> (time interval between <b>rate</b> <b>changes</b> less than 200 [*]sec).
