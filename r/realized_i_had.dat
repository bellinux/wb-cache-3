It all came flooding back in the process of writing this song, I think we all realized just how painful it had been for us.." ...|$|E

He later {{recalled}} that [...] "I wanted to see what had happened. I wanted to see if people needed help. I went downstairs and helped for a bit with some people on stretchers. Then I came back up here and started – I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to get back up here and get at it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Lust for Life {{sessions}} {{took place}} {{soon after the}} completion of a concert tour in support of The Idiot album, the tour ending on 16 April 1977. Pop has stated, [...] "David and I had determined that we would record that album very quickly, which we wrote, recorded, and mixed in eight days, and because we had done it so quickly, {{we had a lot of}} money left over from the advance, which we split." [...] The singer slept little during its making, commenting [...] "See, Bowie's a hell of a fast guy... I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to be quicker than him, otherwise whose album was it gonna be?" [...] Pop's spontaneous lyrical method inspired Bowie to improvise his own words on his next project, [...] "Heroes".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the series}} {{lengthened}} from a half-hour {{to an hour}} in 1980, multiple cast members who portrayed characters from the original core families departed because their contracts only bound them to performing in a half-hour show. A number of the characters were recast until {{one of the few}} remaining original actors, Jaime Lyn Bauer, who portrayed Lorie Brooks, decided to leave. When she announced her intention not to renew her contract, Bell decided to replace the original core families. [...] "As I studied the remaining cast, I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> two characters- Paul Williams, played by Doug Davidson, and Jack Abbott, played by Terry Lester- both of whom had a relatively insignificant presence on the show," [...] Bell said. [...] "They didn't have families. Hell, they didn't even have bedrooms. But these became the two characters I would build our two families around." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I got real nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E

5000|$|Quan {{was criticized}} for {{apparent}} insensitivity at an Oakland City Council meeting on March 6, 2013. In a conversation with war veteran Scott Olsen, she accused him of having a [...] "chip on his shoulder". Later, Olsen tweeted, “J. Quan told me she <b>realizes</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> a chip on my shoulder. Insulting, more like a broken skull and brain trauma.” ...|$|R

2500|$|ABC {{required}} Wallenda to wear {{a safety}} harness for the walk. After {{the decision was made}} in mid-May, a spokesperson for ABC explained: [...] "We had always made clear from the beginning that significant safety precautions would need to be taken. This is the outcome of that." [...] Wallenda was not happy about the decision, stating [...] "It's disheartening—I wanted to do it without anything." [...] The Niagara Parks Commission indicated it was unaware of such a requirement when they were considering approval. [...] During the walk, Wallenda told his dad that he felt [...] "like a jackass" [...] wearing the harness. Many observers predicted he would remove the harness partway through the walk, but ultimately he did not do so. Before the crossing, Wallenda had promised that he only would remove the harness if it became a hazard during the walk. [...] "When I first found out about it, {{there was no doubt in}} my mind I was going to take it off", he later said. [...] "But as [...] got closer and closer, I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to honor my word. I've always said I'm a man of integrity." [...] He also acknowledged that removing the harness would have created contractual problems with ABC. [...] "The way a TV network works, if something goes wrong, they fire people," [...] he said. [...] "If I would have dropped that tether, four people would have been fired because I'm too selfish to care or because it's all about me." [...] In addition to the harness, Wallenda wore a waterproof track suit and shoes custom made by his mother for the walk. Part moccasin, part ballet shoe, the shoes were designed to get a good grip when wet.|$|E
6000|$|Cold fogs of {{disappointment}} swept in, blotting out my fool's paradise. That inward light without which life is dark indeed died in eclipse. The one thought and desire which I now <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> been feeding on from hour to hour, had been snatched away. To {{think that they}} had been nothing but waste. [...] "Oh, Fanny," [...] I whispered bitterly to myself, [...] "oh, Fanny!" [...] But the face I lifted to her mother showed only defiance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--" [...] I began, {{and there}} I stayed. All {{the words in}} the {{dictionary}} seemed to slip out of my grasp, and I foundered.

Bad enough had I told it to Farrar in an unguarded second. But to her! I was blindly seeking some way of escape when she said softly: ...|$|E

It seems I had already assaulted and disfigured Peavine the spring of the year before. I had sold $600 worth of young fruit trees there--plums, cherries, peaches and pears.

60|$|Then I sat down, {{jammed the}} rod in the socket, {{put on the}} drag, and began to strike. The second {{powerful}} sweep of the rod brought the line tight and I felt that heavy live weight. I struck {{at least a dozen}} times with all my might while the line was going off the reel. The swordfish was moving ponderously. Presently he came up with a great splash, showing his huge fins, and then the dark, slender, sweeping sword. He waved that sword, striking fiercely at the leader. Then he went down. It was only at this moment I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> again hooked a broadbill. Time, ten forty-five.|$|E
60|$|As {{her gaze}} rested on me her eyes opened wide in astonishment, {{and she made}} a little sign with her free hand; a sign which I did not, of course, understand. Just a moment we gazed upon each other, and then the look of hope and renewed courage which had glorified {{her face as she}} {{discovered}} me, faded into one of utter dejection, mingled with loathing and contempt. I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> not answered her signal, and ignorant as I was of Martian customs, I intuitively felt that she had made an appeal for succor and protection which my unfortunate ignorance had prevented me from answering. And then she was dragged out of my sight into the depths of the deserted edifice.|$|E

60|$|She held me {{only the}} tighter, {{tried to pull}} my face around. How {{intuitively}} keen women were. She felt my distress, and that growing, stern, and powerful thing I scarcely dared to acknowledge to myself. Strangely, then, I relaxed and faced her. There was no use trying to foil these feminine creatures. Every second I seemed to grow farther from her. The swiftness of this mood of mine was my only hope. I <b>realized</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to get away quickly, and {{make up my mind}} after that what I intended to do. It was an earnest, soulful, and loving pair of eyes that I met. What did she read in mine? Her hands left mine to slide to my shoulders, to slip behind my neck, to lock there like steel bands. Here was my ordeal. Was it to be as terrible as Steele's had been? I thought it would be, and I swore by all that was rising grim and cold in me that I would be strong. Sally gave a little cry that cut like a blade in my heart, and then she was close-pressed upon me, her quivering breast beating against mine, her eyes, dark as night now, searching my soul.|$|E
6000|$|I have digressed.... Mr. Scherer {{unfolded}} his scheme, {{talking about}} [...] "units" [...] as calmly {{as though they}} were checkers on a board instead of huge, fiery, reverberating mills where thousands and thousands of human beings toiled day and night--beings with families, and hopes and fears, whose destinies were to be dominated by the will of the man who sat opposite me. But--did not he in his own person represent the triumph of that American creed of opportunity? He, too, had been through the fire, had sweated beside the blasts, had handled the ingots of steel. He was one of the [...] "fittest" [...] who had survived, and looked it. Had he no memories of the terrors of that struggle?... Adolf Scherer had grown to be a giant. And yet without me, without my profession he was a helpless giant, at the mercy of those alert and vindictive lawmakers who sought to restrain and hamper him, to check his growth with their webs. How stimulating the idea of his dependence! How exhilarating too, the thought that that vision which had first possessed me as an undergraduate--on my visit to Jerry Kyme--was at last to be <b>realized!</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> now become the indispensable associate of the few who divided the spoils, I was to have a share in these myself.|$|E
