2500|$|The Servian reforms {{increased}} the number of tribes and expanded the city, which was protected by a new rampart, moat and wall. The enclosed area was divided into four administrative <b>regiones</b> (<b>regions,</b> or quarters); the Suburana, Esquilana, Collina and Palatina. Servius himself is said to have taken a new residence, on the Esquiline. The situation beyond the walls is unclear, but thereafter, membership of a Roman voting-tribe would have depended on residence rather than kinship, ancestry and inheritance. This would have brought significant numbers of urban and rural plebs into active political life; and a significant number of these would have been allocated to centuries of the first class, and therefore likely to vote. The city of Rome's division into [...] "quarters" [...] remained in use until 7 BC, when Augustus divided the city into 14 new regiones. In modern Rome, an ancient portion of surviving wall is attributed to Servius, the remainder supposedly being rebuilt after the sack of Rome in 390/387 BC by the Gauls.|$|R

5000|$|The reformation of {{the tribal}} {{divisions}} increased the city's sacred boundary (the pomerium) to include Rome's seven hills and their inhabitants. Some form of defence was constructed to protect the enlarged city, later reinforced by a wall, and the enclosed area was divided into four new administrative <b>regiones</b> (<b>regions,</b> or quarters); the Suburana, Collina, Palatina, and the Esquilana, where Servius himself {{is said to have}} taken a new residence. The situation beyond the walls is unclear: similar tribal areas, perhaps known as pagi, may have extended into the surrounding Roman territories (the ancient ager Romanus), and some of their inhabitants would have qualified for citizenship under the Servian class reforms. Either way, membership of a Roman voting-tribe depended thereafter on residence, rather than ancestry and inheritance. This would have brought significant numbers of urban and rural plebs into active political life; and a number of these would have been allocated to centuries of the first class, the most likely to vote. The city's division into [...] "quarters" [...] remained in use until 7 BC, when Augustus divided the city, by now much more densely populated, into 14 new regiones.|$|R

50|$|The <b>regions</b> (<b>regiones)</b> of Peru are the first-level {{administrative}} subdivisions of Peru. Since its 1821 independence, Peru {{had been}} divided into departments (departamentos) but faced {{the problem of}} an increasing centralization {{of political and economic}} power in its capital, Lima. After several unsuccessful decentralization attempts, the legal figure of region became official and regional governments were elected to manage the departments on November 20, 2002, until their planned fusion into real regions.|$|R

Thanks to a specific agreement between the Ministry and the Regione Toscana, the hierarchical process established by the “Codice dei Beni Culturali e del Paesaggio” has been overcome as it is acknowledged that all levels of planning contribute and are responsible for the implementation of the landscaping plan, thereby the cohesion, the typical model of regional governance is respected...|$|R
50|$|The Italia illustrata (1474) is a geography, {{based on}} the author's {{personal}} travels, and history of fourteen Italian <b>regions</b> (<b>regiones).</b> Unlike medieval geographers, whose focus was regional, Biondo, taking Strabo for his model, reinstated the idea of Italy to include {{the whole of the}} peninsula. Through topography, he intended to link Antiquity with modern times, with descriptions of each location, the etymology of its toponym and its changes through time, with a synopsis of important events connected with each location. This first historical geography starts with the Roman Republic and Empire, through 400 years of barbarian invasions and an analysis of Charlemagne and later Holy Roman Emperors. He gives an excellent description of the humanist revival and restoration of the classics {{during the first half of}} the fifteenth century.|$|R

It could contribute to guide the contemporary transformation, to support a sustainable development and to organized maintenance policy, in compliance to the policy for an active involvement of civil society in the protection of cultural heritage and for the transparent sharing of geoinformation within public institutions. A collection and organic management of the knowledge acquired represents a fundamental requirement for a proper policy towards an integrated conservation of the cultural heritage as subject of constant alteration...|$|R
40|$|En esta tesis se investigó la dinámica alterna de vórtices superconductores en monocristales de NbSe 2, en condiciones compatibles con el régimen plástico. Mediante mediciones de susceptibilidad ac en el régimen lineal se exploraron configuraciones de vórtices en las inmediaciones de la transición orden - desorden, siguiendo diferentes historias térmicas, magnéticas y dinámicas. También, se estudió la respuesta del sistema después de agitar los {{vortices}} con campos magnéticos oscilatorios. Con estas mediciones, identificamos tres <b>regiones.</b> En la <b>región</b> T T 2 (H) las configuraciones son desordenadas. En la región T 1 T 2 (H) configurations are disordered. In {{the region}} T 1 < T < T 2, shaking the vortex lattice produces plastic (irreversible) deformations that {{we associate with}} the creation and annihilation of disclinations leading to configurations with peculiar properties. Additional studies of this region were performed by changing the frequency and waveform of the shaking field. The highest shaking frequencies lead to the most ordered configurations. The system does not keep memory of the initial condition, but the final configuration depends on the shaking frequency. Using a simple model for the vortex dynamics and performing molecular dyna- mics simulations we analyzed the vortex lattice depinning by an ac external force. We discussed the difference with {{the case of a}} dc external force and considered the most representative observables to characterize the ac depinning. Additional simulation were performed that reveal a possible nature of vortex configurations obtained by shaking protocols in the region T 1 < T < T 2 ithin this picture the vortex configurations could be associated to stationary states in which both, lattice vortex disclinations and the average velocity fluctuate around a stable value. These states could be similar to the fluctuating states proposed in colloidal systems. In summary, a dynamic reorganization in the plastic regime that maintains memory of the shaking frequency, but it is independent of the initial configuration has been observed experimentally and numerically.
