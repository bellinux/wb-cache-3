2500|$|Bipolar design: In {{this type}} of circuit, there are two {{transmitter}} plates and two receiver plates. [...] Each transmitter plate is coupled to a receiver plate. The transmitter oscillator drives the transmitter plates in opposite phase (180° phase difference) by a high alternating voltage, and the load is connected between the two receiver plates. [...] The alternating electric fields induce opposite phase alternating potentials in the receiver plates, and this [...] "push-pull" [...] action causes current to flow {{back and forth between}} the plates through the load. [...] A disadvantage of this configuration for wireless charging is that the two plates in the <b>receiving</b> <b>device</b> must be aligned face to face with the charger plates for the device to work.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after {{arriving}} in California, Farnsworth was prepared to show his models and drawings to a patent attorney who was nationally recognized as an authority on electrophysics. Everson and Gorrell agreed that Farnsworth should apply for patents for his designs, a decision which proved crucial in later disputes with RCA. Most television systems in use at the time used image scanning devices ("rasterizers") employing rotating [...] "Nipkow disks" [...] comprising lenses arranged in spiral patterns such that they swept across an image in a succession of short arcs while focusing the light they captured on photosensitive elements, thus producing a varying electrical signal corresponding to the variations in light intensity. Farnsworth recognized {{the limitations of the}} mechanical systems, and that an all-electronic scanning system could produce a superior image for transmission to a <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Near-field or nonradiative region – This {{means the}} area within about 1 {{wavelength}} (λ) of the antenna. In this region the oscillating electric and magnetic fields are separate and {{power can be}} transferred via electric fields by capacitive coupling (electrostatic induction) between metal electrodes, or via magnetic fields by inductive coupling (electromagnetic induction) between coils of wire. These fields are not radiative, meaning the energy stays within a short distance of the transmitter. If there is no <b>receiving</b> <b>device</b> or absorbing material within their limited range to [...] "couple" [...] to, no power leaves the transmitter. The range of these fields is short, and depends on {{the size and shape}} of the [...] "antenna" [...] devices, which are usually coils of wire. The fields, and thus the power transmitted, decrease exponentially with distance, so if the distance between the two [...] "antennas" [...] Drange is much larger than the diameter of the [...] "antennas" [...] Dant very little power will be received. [...] Therefore, these techniques cannot be used for long range power transmission.|$|E

2500|$|Most remote {{controls}} for electronic appliances use a near infrared diode to emit {{a beam of}} light that reaches the device. A 940 nm wavelength LED is typical. This infrared light is invisible to the human eye, but picked up by sensors on the <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> Video cameras [...] see the diode as if it produces visible purple light. With a single channel (single-function, one-button) remote control the presence of a carrier signal can be used to trigger a function. For multi-channel (normal multi-function) {{remote controls}} more sophisticated procedures are necessary: one consists of modulating the carrier with signals of different frequency. After the receiver demodulates the received signal, it applies the appropriate frequency filters to separate the respective signals. [...] One can often hear the signals being modulated on the infrared carrier by operating a remote control in very close proximity to an AM radio not tuned to a station. [...] Today, IR remote controls almost always use a pulse width modulated code, encoded and decoded by digital computer: a command from a remote control consists of a short train of pulses of carrier-present and carrier-not-present of varying widths.|$|E
2500|$|In 1897, J. J. Thomson, an English physicist, in {{his three}} famous {{experiments}} {{was able to}} deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). [...] The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and {{is also known as}} the Braun tube. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen.A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal Scientific American in 1909. In 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal Nature in which he described how [...] "distant electric vision" [...] could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube (or [...] "Braun" [...] tube) as both a transmitting and <b>receiving</b> <b>device.</b> He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in The Times and the Journal of the Röntgen Society. In a letter to Nature published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some [...] "not very successful experiments" [...] he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died. They were later repeated in 1937 by two different teams, H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting [...] "very faint" [...] images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel. The first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922.|$|E
