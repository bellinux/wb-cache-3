The DMK capitalised on the rice shortage as well as widespread discontent with the Bhaktavatsalam administration. Slogans like Kamarajar Annachi kadalaiparuppu vilai ennachu (Elder Brother (Annachi is a title historically been {{used to refer to}} a person of Kamaraj's caste) Kamaraj, what happened to the price of chana dal?), Bhaktavatsalam annachi arisi vilai ennachu (lit.

The original The Legend of Zelda only has flashing <b>Rupees,</b> worth one, and blue <b>Rupees,</b> worth five. In the original, they were called [...] "Rupies," [...] the singular being [...] "Rupy"; this was later changed. Subsequent games introduced more colors and sizes for <b>Rupees,</b> each denoting a specific value. Generally, green <b>Rupees</b> have the least value, while huge gold or silver <b>Rupees</b> have the most. Phantom Hourglass introduced black <b>Rupees</b> called [...] "Rupoor" [...] that would steal a certain quantity of <b>Rupees</b> depending on their size.

Since that time, silver standards, in which the standard economic unit of account is a fixed weight of silver, have been widespread throughout the world until the 20th century.

A more challenging Hero mode is unlocked upon completing the main adventure.|$|E
5|$|The sepoys {{were also}} accused {{of not being}} able to adjust and adapt to the living {{conditions}} in their new environment. While in India, the sepoys would have a constant supply of goat meat and milk but because it was difficult to receive a constant supply of goat in Singapore, the sepoys had to make do with a substitute – chicken - and very little milk. The sepoys resorted to buying their own meat and milk to make up for the insufficient amount they received and the use of the dollar versus the <b>rupee</b> irked them further.|$|E

5|$|Turning his {{attention}} to southern India, Wheeler discovered remnants of a Roman amphora in a museum, and began excavations at Arikamedu, revealing a port from the first century CE which had traded in goods from the Roman Empire. The excavation had been plagued by severe rains and tropical heat, although {{it was during the}} excavation that World War II ended; in celebration, Wheeler gave all his workers an extra <b>rupee</b> for the day. It has since been alleged that while Wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site, it had previously been established by A. Aiyappan, the Superintendent of the Government Museum in Madras, and the French archaeologist Jouveau Dubreuil, with Wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution. He later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in Brahmagiri, Mysore, which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern India.|$|E

Mobile units were also set up by the District Health Department to minimize the impacts of any post-storm diseases. On October3, Imtiaz Ahmed Shaikh expressed his grief over the damage caused by Cyclonic Storm Onil and stated that he would be touring the affected region within the following days. At least 40million Pakistani <b>rupee</b> ($469,000USD) was allocated in relief funds by Sindh Minister Syed Papoo Shah. On October4, port officials stated that it was safe for fishermen to resume their activities in the Arabian Sea. Later that day, a rain emergency was declared for Hyderabad and emergency shelters were set up in the city. All officers in the Hyderabad Development Authority who were initially put on leave ahead of the cyclone were told to resume work to assist in clearing drainage systems. Several days after the storm, reports indicated that there were more than 300 instances where the city's drainage system collapsed across the area, resulting in standing water in many structures. Residents in these areas, frustrated by the lack of quick action by the government, began holding protests about the flooding. In response to these protests, Shaukat Hayat Bhutto suspended Assistant Engineer Sewage manager, Qamar Memon, for his negligence on draining flood waters.|$|E

5|$|Instead of {{continuing}} to use the side-scrolling perspective introduced to the series by , A Link to the Past reverts to an overhead perspective {{similar to that of}} the original. While A Link to the Past still uses mechanics and concepts from the original game, it also introduces new elements and innovations. For instance, arrows are now separate items, as bombs are in the original, instead of using a <b>Rupee</b> to fire an arrow. A Link to the Past also takes concepts from The Adventure of Link, such as the magic meter, which is used by items such as the Lamp. Control of Link is more flexible than in previous games, as he can walk diagonally and can run with the aid of the Pegasus Boots (Pegasus Shoes in the GBA version),although he cannot use the Pegasus boots diagonally. Link's sword attack was improved to swing sideways instead of merely stabbing forward; this gives his sword a broader range and makes combat easier. Link swings his sword as the default attack in future Zelda games, although stabbing is also possible in the later 3D incarnations.|$|E
