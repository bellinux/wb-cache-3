25|$|Hemoglobin (Hb) is {{synthesized}} in {{a complex}} series of steps. The heme part is synthesized {{in a series of}} steps in the mitochondria and the cytosol of immature red blood cells, while the globin protein parts are synthesized by ribosomes in the cytosol. Production of Hb continues in the cell throughout its early development from the proerythroblast to the <b>reticulocyte</b> in the bone marrow. At this point, the nucleus is lost in mammalian red blood cells, but not in birds and many other species. Even after the loss of the nucleus in mammals, residual ribosomal RNA allows further synthesis of Hb until the <b>reticulocyte</b> loses its RNA soon after entering the vasculature (this hemoglobin-synthetic RNA in fact gives the <b>reticulocyte</b> its reticulated appearance and name).|$|E

Interactions between sickle cells {{involving}} CD 49 d, CD 36, and the {{vascular endothelium}} may initiate vasoocclusion leading to acute painful episodes and multiple organ failure. Materials and Methods. We selected 60 SS {{patients who had}} never been treated by hydroxyurea. We performed a total blood count. We identified with immunophenotyping by flow cytometry total <b>reticulocytes</b> their distribution according to the degree of maturity (mature, intermediate, very immature) and CD 36 + and CD 49 d+ antigens. Stress <b>reticulocytes</b> corresponded to the sum of intermediate and immature cells. Results. Subjects in crisis had more total <b>reticulocytes</b> and very immature <b>reticulocytes</b> than subjects in stationary phase (P< 0. 05). During the crisis, total CD 36 + <b>reticulocytes</b> (214 870 ± 107 584 /μL versus 148 878 ± 115 024 /μL; P< 0. 05) and the very immature CD 36 + <b>reticulocytes</b> (28. 9 ± 7. 9 % versus 23. 0 ± 6. 4 %; P< 0. 05) increased. The clinical status had no impact on CD 49 d+ <b>reticulocytes.</b> Conclusion. The rates of stress <b>reticulocytes</b> in general and those expressing CD 49 d and CD 36 were very high.

40|$|The predilection of Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) for <b>reticulocytes</b> {{is a major}} {{obstacle}} for its establishment in a long-term culture system, as this requires a continuous supply of large quantities of <b>reticulocytes,</b> representing only 1 - 2 % of circulating red blood cells. We here compared the production of <b>reticulocytes</b> using an established in vitro culture system from three different sources of hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells (HSPC), i. e. umbilical cord blood (UCB), bone marrow (BM) and adult peripheral blood (PB). Compared to CD 34 (+) -enriched populations of PB and BM, CD 34 (+) -enriched populations of UCB produced the highest amount of <b>reticulocytes</b> that could be invaded by P. vivax. In addition, when CD 34 (+) -enriched cells were first expanded, a further extensive increase in <b>reticulocytes</b> was seen for UCB, {{to a lesser degree}} BM but not PB. As invasion by P. vivax was significantly better in <b>reticulocytes</b> generated in vitro, we also suggest that P. vivax may have a preference for invading immature <b>reticulocytes,</b> which should be confirmed in future studies...|$|R
25|$|Aplastic crises are acute worsenings of the patient's {{baseline}} anaemia, producing pale appearance, fast heart rate, and fatigue. This {{crisis is}} normally triggered by parvovirus B19, which directly affects production of {{red blood cells}} by invading the red cell precursors and multiplying in and destroying them. Parvovirus infection almost completely prevents red blood cell production {{for two to three}} days. In normal individuals, this is of little consequence, but the shortened red cell life of SCD patients results in an abrupt, life-threatening situation. <b>Reticulocyte</b> counts drop dramatically during the disease (causing reticulocytopenia), and the rapid turnover of red cells leads to the drop in haemoglobin. This crisis takes 4 days to one week to disappear. Most patients can be managed supportively; some need blood transfusion.|$|E
500|$|An anucleated cell {{contains}} no nucleus and is, therefore, incapable of dividing to produce daughter cells. The best-known anucleated cell is the mammalian red blood cell, or erythrocyte, which also lacks other organelles such as mitochondria, and serves {{primarily as a}} transport vessel to ferry oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues. Erythrocytes mature through erythropoiesis in the bone marrow, where they lose their nuclei, organelles, and ribosomes. The nucleus is expelled {{during the process of}} differentiation from an erythroblast to a <b>reticulocyte,</b> which is the immediate precursor of the mature erythrocyte. The presence of mutagens may induce the release of some immature [...] "micronucleated" [...] erythrocytes into the bloodstream. Anucleated cells can also arise from flawed cell division in which one daughter lacks a nucleus and the other has two nuclei.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} infected culture supernatant of erythrocytes, fractionation of culture supernatant and serum from dogs infected with Babesia gibsoni (B. gibsoni) on the maturation of canine <b>reticulocytes</b> in vitro. The SDS-PAGE demonstrated that significantly broader bands were generated by both the infected culture supernatant of erythrocytes and the serum from dogs chronically infected with B. gibsoni. The culture supernatant of erythrocytes infected with B. gibsoni strongly suppressed the maturation of <b>reticulocytes.</b> Prior studies showed that chronically infected serum had inhibitory effects on both the maturation of <b>reticulocytes</b> and the canine pyrimidine 5 '-nucleotidase subclass I and purine-specific 5 '-nucleotidase activity. In addition, serum free infected culture supernatant of erythrocytes had an inhibitory effect on the morphological maturation of <b>reticulocytes.</b> These results suggest that infected serum and culture supernatant of erythrocytes might accumulate excess proteins and/or metabolites {{as a result of}} the inhibited maturation of <b>reticulocytes</b> and decreased activity of erythrocyte 5 '-nucleotidase. Furthermore, the fractions observed at > 150 kDa- and 150 - 70 kDa- in the infected culture supernatant and serum retarded the maturation of canine <b>reticulocytes</b> in vitro. The results obtained from the in vitro examinations, in the present study, suggested that B. gibsoni itself and/or its metabolites might release certain proteins in the infected culture supernatant and serum from infected dogs and as a result delay morphological maturation of canine <b>reticulocytes...</b>|$|R

50|$|The <b>reticulocyte</b> {{production}} index (RPI), also called a corrected <b>reticulocyte</b> count (CRC), is a calculated value {{used in the}} diagnosis of anemia.

The problem arises because the <b>reticulocyte</b> count {{is not really a}} count but rather a percentage: it reports the number of reticulocytes {{as a percentage of the}} number of red blood cells.

30|$|The {{principal}} {{physiological function}} of EPO is {{red blood cell}} production, which results from a tightly controlled proliferation and differentiation pathway [23]. Early hematopoietic progenitor cells differentiate into burst-forming unit-erythroid cells (BFU-Es).

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} β-thalassemic <b>reticulocytes</b> have implied a {{decreased}} amount of functional β-mRNA but unimpaired {{translation of the}} β-mRNA present. However, the β/α synthetic ratios in β-thalassemic marrow are higher than those observed in <b>reticulocytes</b> of the same patients. This could imply that marrow cells contain an abnormally functioning β-mRNA no longer active in <b>reticulocytes.</b> To test the function of mRNA found in marrow, intact cells were incubated with [35 S]methionine and the relative amounts of nascent α- and β-chains on polysomes of different sizes were measured by tryptic digestion and determination of the specific activities of the respective peptides. Results showed that in normal and β-thalassemic marrow, {{as well as in}} <b>reticulocytes,</b> β-chain production, though deficient, occurs predominantly on larger polysomes than the production of α-chains. In one patient with severe thalassemia and very little production of β-chains in marrow or <b>reticulocytes,</b> δ-chain synthesis was found predominantly on larger polysomes than α-chain synthesis. These results indicate that in β-thalassemic as well as in nonthalassemic marrow and <b>reticulocytes,</b> each β- and δ-mRNA initiates protein synthesis at a rate faster than does each α-mRNA, and suggest that the β-mRNA in contact with polyribosomes is normally functioning but quantitatively deficient in β-thalassemic marrow as well as in <b>reticulocytes.</b> No translational defect was detected in a similar study performed in <b>reticulocytes</b> of a patient with hemoglobin H disease, suggesting a normally functioning mRNA in contact with polyribosomes in this condition as well. In both thalassemias, unbalanced synthesis of α- and β-chains was more pronounced on polysomes than in completed chains. This difference possibly reflects a compensatory delay in translation of the nonthalassemic chain, which is present in excess...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Belgrade rat has a microcytic, {{hypochromic}} anemia inherited as an {{autosomal recessive}} trait (gene symbol b).

Hence, Belgrade <b>reticulocytes</b> are iron deficient. We show that a chromatographic method is able to measure the amount of ‘free’ heme in <b>reticulocytes.</b> Most of the ‘free’ heme {{is the result of}} biosynthesis. Succinylacetone, an inhibitor of heme synthesis, decreases the level of ‘free’ heme and cycloheximide, an inhibitor of globin synthesis, increases the ‘free’ heme level. In a pulse-chase experiment with 59 Fe-transferrin, the ‘free’ heme pool behaves as an intermediate, with a half-life of just over 2 h. Belgrade <b>reticulocytes</b> contain about 40 % as much ‘free’ heme as do heterozygous or homozygous <b>reticulocytes.</b> This deficiency of ‘free’ heme slows initiation of translation in Belgrade <b>reticulocytes</b> by increasing the level of an inhibitor of initiation. Thus the Belgrade rat makes a whole animal model available with chronic heme deficiency...|$|R
