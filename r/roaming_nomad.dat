50|$|The {{construction}} of berkads also has disadvantages. In the late 1950s {{there were only}} still only a few water points in the Haud, a vast steppe {{on the border of}} Somalia and Ethiopia of importance to nomads with their cattle. <b>Nomads</b> <b>roamed</b> according to a traditional seasonal migration and always had {{to take into account the}} number of days to walk to the next place where they could water their cattle. Around 2001 there were already around 7000 berkads in the Haud, such that the area is now permanently grazed. This overgrazing leads to ecological degradation and erosion. Settlements also arise around clusters of berkads, increasing population pressure.|$|R

25|$|As the 10th century progressed, the Khazars were {{no longer}} able to command tribute from the Volga Bulgars, and their {{relationship}} with the Byzantines deteriorated, as Byzantium increasingly allied with the Pechenegs against them. The Pechenegs were thus secure to raid the lands of the Khazars from their base between the Volga and Don rivers, allowing them to expand to the west. Rus' relations with the Pechenegs were complex, as the groups alternately formed alliances with and against one another. The Pechenegs were <b>nomads</b> <b>roaming</b> the steppe raising livestock which they traded with the Rus' for agricultural goods and other products. The lucrative Rus' trade with the Byzantine Empire had to pass through Pecheneg-controlled territory, so the need for generally peaceful relations was essential. Nevertheless, while the Primary Chronicle reports the Pechenegs entering Rus' territory in 915 and then making peace, they were waging war with one another again in 920. Pechenegs are reported assisting the Rus' in later campaigns against the Byzantines, yet allied with the Byzantines against the Rus' at other times.|$|R
40|$|The Juhena {{tribe in}} the northwestern region of Saudi Arabia, the Hijaz, live in coastal towns and villages and in remote, jagged {{mountains}} inland, parallel to the Red Sea coast. The coastal area has absorbed diverse cultural influences because of its prox-imity to Africa and Egypt and its location on an ancient trade route, on which Muslim pilgrims travel to the holy cities of Makkah and Medina. Some members of the tribe, such as the Egyptian-born mayor of Umlaj, have their roots elsewhere and have been adopted by the Juhena. Coastal inhabitants are settled, semi-nomadic and nomadic, and survive by herding, fishing and trading. Some engage in trades such as saddle-making and metal-working. In town, the government hires office workers, guards and drivers. There are schools, hospi-tals and utilities which support workers. In the surrounding desert, <b>nomads</b> <b>roam</b> but still {{send their children to}} school near town. Some women who demonstrated fiber art tech-niques for me lived part-time in town {{and the rest of the}} time in huts on the outskirts; they raised sheep, goats and chickens.

40|$|On many {{occasions}} cinema {{has chosen to}} shoot movies in locales other than the ones in which {{the events of the}} films are supposed to take place in. This could be due to various reasons, namely cheaper production costs, or inability {{to gain access to the}} original place. The choice of location, however, tries to provide a mirror image of the original country. In portrayals of Arab lands and namely in Hollywood films, this rarely holds true. Irrespective of the country in which the action takes place, the landscapes are the same, and the depiction willfully ignores the actual geographical make-up of the country at play. Instead, the Arab countries are always presented as an unidentified mass of scorching deserts, and here the emphasis is on the wild, harsh, and inhabitable terrain on which sporadic barbarian <b>nomads</b> <b>roam,</b> as only they can belong to such landscapes. Such landscapes can only be tamed by a superior force. These immature and uninformed presentations persist to this day in film. Given that the world is becoming more in McLuhan’s term a global village, such misrepresentations are not acceptable. Furthermore, countries like the USA, have maintained and especially since September 11 th, 2010, that they want to erase misunderstandings between the Arab world and the West. Such representations are reinforcing misconceptions. One image of the Arab city exists. In this chapter, I choose to analyze the reason behind these false portrayals from a postcolonial and postmodern perspectives drawing on Albert Memmi, Edward Said, Frantz Fannon and Jean Baudrillard, reflecting on films such as The Siege, Syriana, Body of Lies, Disney’s Aladdin on the one side and City of Lights and Captain Abu Raed on the other...|$|R

In contrast, the Juhena living in the mountains are relatively isolated semi-nomads, living in villages and settlements. Only recently in history have those living in the larger villages started using concrete houses, in addition to the traditional tents, though they use stone buildings for grain storage. Herding and agriculture are their means of support. They keep herds of camels and goats, and grow wheat and dates. Both women and men engage in agricultural work. In recent years some electricity has been brought in, and owing to motorized transportation, more goods and services have become available. The village of Shabaha is a hub for fifty other villages and settlements administered by a branch of the regional governorate. It has schools and a clinic with a doctor and a nurse on duty full-time. The road into the mountains is rocky and treacherous; travelers seldom venture there. The remoteness of the area has helped to preserve an ancient way of life, vestiges of which remain...|$|R
