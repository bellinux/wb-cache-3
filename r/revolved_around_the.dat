5|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{game called}} Indiana Jones and the Spear of Destiny was planned, which <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Spear of Longinus. Development was outsourced {{to a small}} Canadian studio, but eventually stopped as LucasArts did not have experience with the supervision of external teams. Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story into another four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.|$|E
5|$|Barley, however, took on {{a humorous}} tone and <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> adventures of the Captain Julius Lauterbach of the German Imperial Navy. Once again, the humorous nature of the book underplays and {{potentially}} undermines the actual set of events. Supported by the Singapore Film Commission and the Singapore High Commission in India, Daljit Ami made a Objectifs Residency-sponsored 2017 feature-length documentary Singapore Mutiny – A Reclamation in English and Saada Singapore in Punjabi.|$|E
5|$|In the Christian world {{prior to}} Galileo's {{conflict}} with the Church, the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth {{was the center of}} the universe and that all heavenly bodies <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth, or the Tychonic system that blended geocentrism with heliocentrism. Nevertheless, following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo, heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial; Copernicus's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582.|$|E
2500|$|It is conceptually a geocentric model: the Earth is at {{the center}} of the universe, the Sun and Moon and <b>the</b> stars <b>revolve</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Earth, and the other five planets <b>revolve</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Sun.|$|R

5000|$|In 2000, the Belgian federal {{government}} commenced {{a program of}} civil service reform, called the “Copernicus Plan.” The object of the plan is for citizens to no longer <b>revolve</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> civil service, but for the civil service to <b>revolve</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> citizens.https://web.archive.org/web/20050819181323/http://www.eiro.eurofound.eu.int/2000/06/feature/be0006317f.html ...|$|R
5|$|The biggest {{challenge}} {{to the notion of}} the universality of attachment theory came from studies conducted in Japan where the concept of amae plays a prominent role in describing family relationships. Arguments <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> appropriateness of the use of the Strange Situation procedure where amae is practiced. Ultimately research tended to confirm the universality hypothesis of attachment theory. Most recently a 2007 study conducted in Sapporo in Japan found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main and Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.|$|E
5|$|Chocobo Tales was {{announced}} in the Summer of 2006. Initial details <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> main character, Chocobo, the opening sequence {{of the story and}} the picture book worlds. Further details included the pop-up duels and more information pertaining to the story. The game was produced by Yuki Yokoyama and took 20 staff members a year to create. The first decision made was to create a game about chocobos, market research showed that the characters are most popular with younger players, thus the game was designed for the Nintendo DS system, a popular system with that age group.|$|E
5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers. The Taoist tradition of Chinese alchemy, for example, can be {{considered part of the}} life sciences due to its emphasis on health (with the ultimate goal being the elixir of life). The system of classical Chinese medicine usually <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> theory of yin and yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E

In the climax, India wins {{the war and}} Mahadevan kills Chengiz and avenges the brutal murder of many Indian soldiers.|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, the Hamburg scene <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Kaiserkeller, Top Ten, Star-Club, Beer-Shop, Mambo, Holle, Wagabond (pronounced {{vagabond}} in German) and the Pacific Hotel, {{as well as}} the less popular clubs like Grannies, the Ice Cream Shop, Chugs, and Sacha's. The Reeperbahn and the Grosse Freiheit were decorated with neon lights, with posters advertising the performers in the clubs. Each club had a doorman whose job was to entice customers inside, as the drinks were expensive (for Babycham and watered-down beer). Customers who would not, or could not afford to pay were dealt with severely by being beaten and then thrown out.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of Christianity from {{the sixth century}} brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small, educated and overwhelmingly male, elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society. Literary life <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> contemplation of texts and the copying of manuscripts. Libraries were of great importance to monastic communities. The one at Iona may have been exceptional, but it demonstrates that the monks {{were part of the}} mainstream of European Christian culture.|$|E
5|$|The {{issue of}} whether the Act was constitutionally valid <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> fact that {{immigration}} detention {{is a form of}} administrative detention, or detention imposed by the executive branch of government. Detention generally {{is considered to be a}} judicial function, which can be exercised only by courts, pursuant to Chapter III of the Australian Constitution. However, there are certain exceptions which allow non-judicial detention, such as detention in order to effect an arrest, or detention for quarantine purposes. Courts in Australia have also held that, generally, detention of non-citizens for immigration purposes is also valid.|$|E

An ancient virus contained in the mausoleum has quickly killed all the archaeological team, but prior to their death they radioed that a very important and undocumented tapestry is hanging inside. The local government is planning to cleanse the area with a fuel-air explosion in 15 minutes, so the scientists will send in an autonomous aerial robot to find the mausoleum, enter it (or send in a sensor probe/subvehicle) and relay pictures of the tapestry back prior {{to the destruction of}} the mausoleum and its contents.|$|E
5|$|There was a {{brief period}} when the episode had a {{different}} subplot that <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> restaurant chain Planet Hollywood. Groening {{had been told by}} a spokesperson that if he put Planet Hollywood in The Simpsons, the creators of the restaurant, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone, would agree to make guest appearances on the show. The writers of The Simpsons were excited about this so they wrote a new subplot for the episode that featured Planet Hollywood and the three actors. However, for unknown reasons, they were unable to appear in the episode.|$|E
5|$|Country {{music is}} {{primarily}} a fusion of African American blues and spirituals with Appalachian folk music, adapted for pop audiences and popularized beginning in the 1920s. The origins of country are in rural Southern folk music, which was primarily Irish and British, with African and continental European musics. Anglo-Celtic tunes, dance music, and balladry were the earliest predecessors of modern country, then known as hillbilly music. Early hillbilly also borrowed elements of the blues and drew upon more aspects of 19th-century pop songs as hillbilly music evolved into a commercial genre eventually known as country and western and then simply country. The earliest country instrumentation <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> European-derived fiddle and the African-derived banjo, with the guitar later added. String instruments like the ukulele and steel guitar became commonplace due to the popularity of Hawaiian musical groups in the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have gone to other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had gone to a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E
5|$|The NMP {{scheme was}} not {{introduced}} without controversy, which may {{lead one to}} question {{the effectiveness of the}} scheme in strengthening representative democracy. Despite the protests of many PAP MPs, the party whip was enforced to effect the passing of this scheme. Criticism of the scheme mainly <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> dilution of the democratic legitimacy of the Parliament since the electorate has no say in choosing the NMP based on his or her merits. Further, there may be doubts as to the NMP's commitment and willingness to serve as an MP, since the NMP bypasses the electoral process. The scheme has also given rise to allegations that it serves as another platform for the PAP to undercut support for the opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{first book}} printed in France, Epistolae ("Letters"), by Gasparinus de Bergamo (Gasparino da Barzizza), was {{published}} in Paris in 1470 by the press established by Johann Heynlin. Since then, Paris has been {{the centre of the}} French publishing industry, the home of some of the world's best-known writers and poets, and the setting for many classic works of French literature. Almost all the books published in Paris in the Middle Ages were in Latin, rather than French. Paris did not become the acknowledged capital of French literature until the 17th century, with authors such as Boileau, Corneille, La Fontaine, Molière, Racine, several coming from the provinces, and the foundation of the Académie française. In the 18th century, the literary life of Paris <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> cafés and salons, and was dominated by Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Pierre de Marivaux, and Beaumarchais.|$|E

Styles followed by trying to join the two fractions together {{leading up to the}} December 6, 2007 episode of Impact!, where Cage became leader of a joint alliance, until Angle and Robert Roode attacked Cage later in the episode. On the December 20, 2007 episode of Impact!, Angle versus Cage for the title was promoted for Final Resolution.|$|E
5|$|The script {{received}} constant {{input from}} the producers and from Shatner and Nimoy. The discussions led to repeated rewrites, {{right up to the}} day the pages were to be shot. At one point, scenes were being rewritten so often it became necessary to note on script pages the hour of the revision. Though changes were constant, the biggest push for alteration <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ending. Much of the rewriting {{had to do with the}} relationships of Kirk and Spock, Decker and Ilia, and the Enterprise and Vger. A final draft of the third act was approved in late September 1978, but had it not been for a Penthouse interview where NASA director Robert Jastrow said that mechanical forms of life were likely, the ending may not have been approved at all.|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} {{is an exercise}} in which the High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders to ensure that they conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes <b>revolved</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E
