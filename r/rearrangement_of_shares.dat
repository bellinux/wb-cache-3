40|$|The BF₃-catalysed <b>rearrangements</b> <b>of</b> three epoxy-cholestanes {{have been}} reinvestigated. The {{products}} isolated from these reactions were markedly dependent of the solvent.

The preference for hydrogen, relative to deuterium, migration in the <b>rearrangement</b> <b>of</b> monodeuterated isobutene oxide (48) to give isobutyraldehyde has been measured. The BF₃-catalysed <b>rearrangement</b> <b>of</b> the unsymmetrical epoxide (63) to give aldehyde (112) was found to proceed by selective migration (ca. 1. 9 : 1) of the hydrogen atom (Hb) trans to the t-butyl group.

40|$|We discuss memory {{effects in}} the {{conductance}} of hopping insulators due to slow <b>rearrangements</b> <b>of</b> many-electron clusters leading to formation of polarons close to the electron hopping sites. An abrupt change in the gate voltage and corresponding shift of the chemical potential change populations of the hopping sites, which then slowly relax due to <b>rearrangements</b> <b>of</b> the clusters.

30|$|In our case, the {{monomorphic}} PTLD showed <b>rearrangement</b> <b>of</b> BCL 6 by FISH (Fig.  3 a), {{whereas the}} cHL-type PTLD showed <b>rearrangement</b> <b>of</b> BCL 6 during the double labeling detection method that combined FISH and immunohistochemical staining (Fig.  3 b). From these results, {{we concluded that}} these two PTLDs might have a common origin. Several reports have shown that cHL and FL are derived from a shared germinal center B cell clone [16]. Nakamura et al. reported that FL converted to cHL by proving a <b>rearrangement</b> <b>of</b> BCL 2 [17]. A <b>rearrangement</b> <b>of</b> BCL 6 is mainly observed in FL or diffuse large B cell lymphoma and is rarely observed in cHL.

Five percent of patients who developed EBV-related PTLD developed another EBV-related PTLD, {{but there are no}} reports that can prove a causal relationship between the two types of PTLD [19].
