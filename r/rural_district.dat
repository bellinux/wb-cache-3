5000|$|The {{urban and}} <b>rural</b> {{sanitary}} <b>districts</b> were superseded in 1899, under the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898, by urban and <b>rural</b> <b>districts.</b> Unlike <b>rural</b> sanitary <b>districts,</b> <b>rural</b> <b>districts</b> could not cross county boundaries: so for instance, Ballyshannon <b>rural</b> sanitary <b>district</b> was split into Ballyshannon No. 1, Ballyshannon No. 2 and Ballyshannon No. 3 <b>rural</b> <b>districts</b> in Counties Donegal, Fermanagh and Leitrim respectively. The Local Government Act 1925 abolished <b>rural</b> <b>districts</b> in the Irish Free State, creating a single <b>rural</b> sanitary <b>district</b> for the non-urban portion of each county, called the [...] "county health district". The Local Government (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1934 allowed this district to be split on {{request of the}} county council; this happened only in County Cork, the largest county, which was split into three health districts.|$|R
