She then started writing material with several songwriters, including Hillary Lindsey and Kear.

500|$|When Tom is {{introduced}} in the first season finale, he wears a fake beard and old clothes. He continues to appear under this guise throughout the second season, only revealing his beard to be fake in the finale. M. C.

The producers describe Tom as [...] "friendly", earning him the nickname [...] "Mr. Friendly". One critic has described him as [...] "sarcastic" [...] and [...] "bright". Tom's dislike of blood causes him to struggle while supervising Ben's operation, which Emerson believes makes him [...] "cuddly". Gainey does not think he is very similar to Tom, commenting, [...] "He seems to be very loyal and I'm a very loyal person so I have that in common, but other than that, I don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> he's about. He seems much more socially awkward than I am." [...] After Tom was revealed to be gay during season four, M. C. Gainey stated that [...] "anytime you've got a group of people, somebody's got to be marching to a different drummer- that would be Tom Friendly." ...|$|E
500|$|As a child, Diamandis took {{inspiration}} from the differing musical tastes of her parents – Dolly Parton, Enya and George Michael from her mother, and Haris Alexiou from her father – while also admiring pop acts of the era including the Spice Girls, Britney Spears and S Club 7.

She began smoking two years later in an attempt to sound like The Distillers' frontwoman Brody Dalle, [...] "but it never worked, and now I'm just stuck with a bad habit." [...] She has cited Dalle and Spears as her musical influences, and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo-fi production he uses. She has jokingly stated that [...] "I probably have a bit of a different sound because I don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I'm doing!," [...] referencing her lack of formal musical training.
