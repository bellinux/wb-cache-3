30|$|Overall, C. procera latex and ethanolic extract {{of leaves}} {{as well as}} ABM induced cardiotoxic and {{testicular}} toxic effects which was evidenced by increases {{in the activities of}} heart enzymes in serum and decreases in male sex hormones in serum in addition to heart and testis histological perturbances. However the ethanolic leaf extract seemed to be more effective in deteriorating oxidative stress and antioxidant defense system in both heart and testis, the latex produced more deleterious effects on the testicular function and sex hormones’ levels. So, the plant latex and ethanolic extract are considered toxic and they may be suggested as rodenticides at 1 / 10 and 1 / 20 of LD 50 which are more or less similar to the <b>reference</b> <b>pesticide,</b> ABM.|$|E
40|$|In vitro models, {{including}} the widely used PC 12 cell line, can increase insight into cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative processes. An important determinant for {{the vulnerability of}} cells for chemical insults may be the endogenous level of oxidative stress. To test this hypothesis, we induced different degrees of cellular stress in PC 12 cells by altering their ROS production using dexamethasone, l-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) and iron. These different PC 12 models were subsequently used to investigate whether the degree of cellular stress could increase their susceptibility to environmental pollutants. The characteristics of these stressed PC 12 cell subtypes and their vulnerability to the <b>reference</b> <b>pesticide</b> rotenone were investigated {{using a combination of}} biochemical (oxidative stress, cell viability, and α-synuclein expression) and functional (fluorescent calcium imaging) assays. Our combined data demonstrate that chemically-induced stress in PC 12 cells increases the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alters calcium homeostasis and α-synuclein expression. Moreover, l-DOPA and FeSO 4 pre-treated PC 12 cells show increased vulnerability to rotenone-induced cytotoxicity. These chemically-stressed cell models may therefore prove valuable to investigate how increased cellular stress influences neurotoxic outcome, for example in case of mixture toxicity...|$|E

40|$|In {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the {{indiscriminate}} release of xenobiotic chemicals of different chemical and structural complexity into the environment provoked serious and most often irreversible alterations of the natural environmental balance. Indeed, soil contamination by highly toxic compounds has greatly increased, with negative, irreversible effects on soil quality and health. Several chemical, biological, and biochemical soil properties have been profoundly altered, and their main effect has been the continuous loss of soil functions in sustaining the survival of living organisms. Among chemical pollutants, compounds like pesticides and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons arrive to the soil from different anthropic sources and have high toxicity toward humans, plants, and animals. Assessing the soil quality is a basic requirement for sustainable land use. Soil microbial and biochemical activities are sensitive to several natural and human-induced changes and may provide a helpful tool to assess soil status, its quality, and its productivity.

Three different strategies were considered for material processing, based on the physicochemical properties of the vegetable and the target pesticides. As a result, a frozen spiked slurry of fresh cucumber, a spiked freeze-dried cucumber powder, and a freeze-dried cucumber powder spiked by spraying of the powder were studied. The effects of processing and aspects related to material reconstitution were evaluated by monitoring the pesticide levels in the three materials. Two analytical methods based on LC-MS/MS and GC-MS/MS respectively were developed and validated in-house. The spiked freeze-dried cucumber powder was selected as the most feasible material and more exhaustive studies of homogeneity and stability of pesticide residues in the matrix were carried out. Homogeneity between units was satisfactory at a sample intake of dried material as low as 0. 1 g.

Types of Pest Control It may be useful to briefly note the various types of pest control, so as to place control by pesticides in proper perspective. Although controls vary greatly among the various types of pests (insects, plants, fungi, vertebrates, etc.), one can identify some basic categories of pest control such as follows: a. Mechanical control [...] involving physically preventing the pest from causing the damage by removing/isolating the pest from the site of attack or by physically debilitating the pest. Includes legal control through quarantine. b. Biological control [...] other organisms control pest or render harmless. c. Host/target resistance [...] development of plant or animal resistance to attack by pest organism, including manipulation of genetics, etc. (can be considered a form of biological control in some cases). d. Chemical control [...] use of chemical pesticide to obtain desired effect on pest.

Freezing and sterilization were intended to be an alternative to freeze-drying, where a reconstitution step is necessary, to ensure that the matrix format should be as similar as possible to routine laboratory samples. The main reason for the choice of these stabilization techniques is to improve the commutability between real-world samples and CRMs. Based on the method repeatability and the set-up of the study, in average the uncertainty contribution resulting from the homogeneity assessment is 6. 1, 2. 6 and 6. 2 % respectively for the frozen, freeze-dried and sterilized batches of samples. In regard to the short stability studies designed for 4 weeks, stability of all 21 target analytes at - 20 °C, in the frozen and dried matrices was proven by analytical measurements via GC-MS, along with the stability {{of the majority of the}} target pesticides at + 4 °C (except phorate, lambda-cyhalotrin, permethrin and cypermethrin) in the dried matrix. This suggests that transport of such candidate reference material would be feasible at + 4 °C for all target analytes, if phorate, lambda-cyhalotrin, permethrin and cypermethrin were not of interest, in a freeze-dried matrix.

40|$|European Union (EU) {{legislation}} sets stringent {{maximum residue limits}} (MRLs) for pesticides {{in products}} of plant origin. In Council Directives 86 / 362 /EEC 3 and 90 / 642 /EEC 4 maximum residue levels are fixed for pesticide residues in/on products of plant origin. The maximum pesticide residue level in foodstuffs is 0. 01 mg/kg. This general level is applicable 'by default', i. e. in all cases where an MRL has not been specifically set for a product or product type. Member States are asked to check regularly the compliance of foodstuffs with these levels. Besides national monitoring programmes, the commission services recommended, via Commission Recommendation 2002 / 1 /EC, the participation of each member state in a specific EU coordinated monitoring programme. The monitoring programmes often carried out, serve {{as an indicator of}} the level of compliance with these provisions. The general aim of this thesis is to work towards a system which makes it possible to estimate actual pesticide levels throughout Europe. With all monitoring programmes, analytical data of quality assurance measures have to be massively deployed, otherwise data comparability and thus data based decision making might be compromised. Use of reference materials–where available–for quality control/quality assurance is mandatory under the provisions of ISO 17025, and national accreditation bodies should demand the used of such materials for method validation and other quality assurance/quality control measures.
