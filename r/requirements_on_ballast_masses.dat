40|$|Tire {{pressure}} and wheel load are both easily managed parameters which {{play a significant}} role in tillage operations for limiting slip which involves energy loss. To a great extent, this aspect affects the fuel consumption and the time required for soil tillage. The study was focused on the tire {{pressure and}} extra weight variation effect on fuel consumption and work productivity for soil tillage at normal tractor wheels slippage (7 - 15 %). The experimental research unit composed of an 82. 3 kW 4 WD tractor and a reversible 4 -bodies plough is presented. Tests were carried out on a stubble loam, where slip of tractor driving wheels was 15 %, tractor front <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> was varied in the range from 0 to 520 kg and inflation pressure in the tires from 240 kPa to 100 kPa. Dependences of tractor performance indicators <b>on</b> <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> and tires inflation pressure are presented. When tractor tire slip varies in the range from 7 to 15 percent (which is normal slip in the soil), reducing the tires inflation pressure decreases the driving wheel slip and fuel consumption, while increases work productivity. Increasing the additional mass of the tractor (adding ballast weights) decreases the driving wheel slip, increases work productivity, but also increases fuel consumption and soil compaction...|$|R

In the paper, the railway ballast particle force equilibrium is analyzed through basic mechanics and mathematic formula, and a model is set up to discover the factors and influence. The microscopic ballast flying model is used for ballast bed geometry and ballast shape optimization, and guide the ballast flying countering methods. Results show that ballast flying particle is correlated with <b>ballast</b> shape and <b>mass,</b> especially the <b>ballast</b> shape <b>mass</b> ratio corresponds to operation speed.

The configuration investigated consists of a satellite, a tether, and a <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> {{at the opposite end of}} the tether. The position of the movable tether attachment is controlled by the stabilization control logic.

The vibrations induce discomfort and early fatigue to the operator. In order to control the vibration transmissibility, a <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> may {{be added to the}} handles. Even if the determination of the appropriate <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> is a critical point in the handle design. The aim of this research was to study the influence of the handle mass modification, on the dynamic structure behaviour. Modal frequencies and subsequent transmissibility calculated by using an analytical approach and a finite elements model, were compared. A good agreement between the results obtained by the two methods was found (average percentage difference calculated on natural frequencies equal to 5. 8 ± 3. 8 %). Power tillers are made generally by small or medium-small size manufacturers that have difficulties in dealing with finite element codes or modal analysis techniques. As a consequence, the proposed analytical method could be used to find the optimal <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> in a simple and economic way, without experimental tests or complex finite element codes.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a homeostatic controller algorithm and its performance, which controls motion of a hybrid-driven underwater glider. The homeostatic controller is inspired from a biological {{process known as}} homeostasis, which maintains a stable state {{in the face of}} massively dynamics conditions. The objective is to obtain a better control performance of the glider motion control system with a presence of disturbance, which is the water current. The algorithm was simulated by using MatlabTM. According to the simulation results, in order to achieve the desired pitch angle, the homeostatic controller was able to optimize the glider’s <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> and distance of the glider’s sliding mass by reducing the <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> up to 17. 7 % and shortening the sliding mass distance up to 53. 7 % when compared with the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) and model predictive control (MPC). Furthermore, validation analyses of the homeostatic controller performance between the simulation and experimental results have shown very satisfactory performance...|$|R

2500|$|Much of the {{reduction}} of the landing precision error was accomplished by an entry guidance algorithm, derived from the algorithm used for guidance of the Apollo Command Modules returning to Earth in the Apollo program. This guidance uses the lifting force experienced by the aeroshell to [...] "fly out" [...] any detected error in range and thereby arrive at the targeted landing site. In order for the aeroshell to have lift, its center of mass is offset from the axial centerline that results in an off-center trim angle in atmospheric flight. This is accomplished by a series of ejectable <b>ballast</b> <b>masses</b> consisting of two [...] tungsten weights that were jettisoned minutes before atmospheric entry. The lift vector was controlled by four sets of two reaction control system (RCS) thrusters that produced approximately [...] of thrust per pair. This ability to change the pointing of the direction of lift allowed the spacecraft to react to the ambient environment, and steer toward the landing zone. Prior to parachute deployment the entry vehicle ejected more <b>ballast</b> <b>mass</b> consisting of six [...] tungsten weights such that the center of gravity offset was removed.|$|R

In general, ballast aggregates are considered as uniformly graded, angular shaped with crushed faces.
