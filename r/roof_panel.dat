25|$|For the 1994 and 1995 {{model year}} Land Rover offered the Defender 90, {{fitted with a}} 3.9-litre V8 engine and a manual {{transmission}} which was clearly intended {{to compete with the}} Jeep Wrangler.

25|$|In 1999, Ford {{launched}} the fourth-generation Ford Taurus {{to replace the}} third generation. Although the doors and mechanical parts were carried over, this generation was designed with a more conservative design in hopes of increasing its appeal to customers. This new shape contained a more upright trunk and rear <b>roof</b> <b>panel,</b> of which increased headroom and trunk space substantially. This generation also contained a redesigned interior that sported a more conservative look, while retaining many features offered in the third generation.|$|E
25|$|The XH series Falcon {{utility and}} van, {{released}} in 1996, were essentially XG models facelifted {{to resemble the}} contemporary Falcon EF sedans and wagons. The XH also gained an all-new front suspension and {{rack and pinion steering}} from the EA–EL series cars. This meant changes to the frame and bodywork, from the firewall forward. The turret (<b>roof)</b> <b>panel</b> on the utility was now domed and lost its squared-off appearance, increasing interior head room. By this time, the popularity of the panel van had faded and Ford released their final Falcon panel van in 1997 as part of the revised XH II series. It was also with this model that the V8 engine was re-introduced into the Falcon utility commercial vehicle range. After 20 years, the fourth generation Falcon was discontinued in June 1999.|$|E

Japanese commuter and express A-trains, and British Rail Class 395 trains are friction stir welded by Hitachi, while Kawasaki applies friction stir spot welding to <b>roof</b> <b>panels</b> and Sumitomo Light Metal produces Shinkansen floor panels. Innovative FSW floor panels are made by Hammerer Aluminium Industries in Austria for the Stadler KISS double decker rail cars, to obtain an internal height of 2 m on both floors and for the new car bodies of the Wuppertal Suspension Railway.|$|R

2500|$|Earlier as {{both were}} {{walking on the}} chain-link mesh which {{comprised}} the cell's ceiling, the metal fasteners were popping off causing the roof to sag and partially give way under their combined weight. According to Terry Funk, the prop guy had purposely designed it that way, but what happened next was unintentional and nearly resulted in a tragedy. In the second huge bump of the night, The Undertaker chokeslammed Mankind atop the chain-link mesh cage. As he landed, the <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> he hit gave way underneath him and Foley fell into the ring hard. In response, announcer Jim Ross shouted, [...] "Good God, Good God!

2500|$|The car {{featured}} a low modern body {{line with a}} prominent waist level groove reminiscent of the then fashionable Chevrolet Corvair. [...] At a time when monocoque construction was becoming mainstream, the 24 sat on a separate and very strong tubular steel chassis: [...] it was therefore possible, even using the economically available materials of the time, to keep the window pillars relatively thin which gave the car an airy cabin and outstanding all-round visibility, while class leading structural rigidity for the body could nonetheless be claimed, thanks to the pleating and reinforcement of the <b>roof</b> <b>panel.</b> The tubular steel front and rear subchassis were bolted to a platform frame that comprised {{the floor and the}} flat steel sidemembers. Under the skin, the structural architecture was little changed from that of the Dyna 54.|$|E
2500|$|In {{keeping with}} Ian Callum's new design {{direction}} for Jaguar, {{it is an}} all-new exterior design and {{a break from the}} XJ series mould carried over on all previous generations. It is a longer, wider car that looks much bigger than its predecessor. The front has clear links with the executive car XF, although with slimmer, sleeker lights and a larger, squarer grille and more aggressive appearance. The rear is the contentious part, like nothing Jaguar has shown before. The upright, swooping taillights, nicknamed [...] "cat's claws", and black roof panels each side of the rear screen, which aim to hide the XJ's width, are the most striking aspects. There is also a standard full-length sunroof, that extends all the way back with just a single body-coloured <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> that the designer likens to bridges on yachts.|$|E

[...] Luggage space decreased by 33% from the previous generation's. The overall weight of the car was not announced by General Motors for many months after its first showing in January 2013. [...] Despite the increased use of aluminum and other light weight materials, numerous publications reported that the weight would remain essentially unchanged from that of the previous generation's. [...] In August, 2013, the weight of the new Corvette was reported to be , meaning it would weigh more than the previous generation's C6 ZR1 model (...) [...] The ZR1 C6 weight included a supercharger and intercooler on its 6.2L engine.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980, both {{front and}} rear bumper covers were restyled with brand new {{integrated}} aerodynamic spoilers {{that resulted in a}} significant reduction in drag and increased radiator air flow. The hood was also restyled as well. The crossed-flag emblems disappeared from the front fenders and were revised to a more elongated style on the nose and fuel door. L-82 emblems moved from the hood to the front fenders on cars ordered with the optional high performance engine. This was the finale for the L-82 corvette emblem, now producing [...] but it could not be mated to a 4-speed, as the manual gearbox was offered only with the small block engine.

Air conditioning became standard, as did the tilt-telescopic steering column, power windows, exterior sport mirrors, and the convenience group. New was an optional <b>roof</b> <b>panel</b> carrier that would mount to the rear fastback deck. Many weight-saving components were introduced including thinner body panels and an aluminum Dana 44 IRS (Independent Rear Suspension) differential and crossmember. The new lighter unit replaced the arguably stronger cast iron GM 10 bolt IRS differential. In line with further weight savings, the aluminum intake manifold associated with L-82 engines since 1978 was now installed in all cars. For the first time, due to California emission considerations, a unique engine application was installed in cars delivered to that state and was mandatory. This motor was a [...] V8 engine rated at , fitted with new tubular stainless steel exhaust manifolds, and mated to an automatic transmission, also mandatory. The carburetor and ignition timing were controlled by Chevrolet’s new Computer Command Control system. The smaller displacement engine was not available in any other state. California buyers were credited $50 as consolation but had to pay for the California emissions certification which was $250. For comparison, the L-48 [...] engine, standard in the other 49 states, was rated at [...] The base price increased four times during the model year raising the cost of the car by more than $1,200 to $14,345,24.|$|E
