50|$|Rocker soles may replace regular soles on any {{style of}} footwear. Some <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes are purpose built {{to reduce the}} {{function}} or replace the lost function of a joint. For example, {{a person with a}} hallux rigidus (stiff big toe) may use a <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe to replace the flexion lost at the metatarsal joint. <b>Rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes are also used to compensate for the lost range of motion, however caused, at the tibiotalar joint (ankle joint). In such cases, the wearer maintains solid and stable footing while standing, but the rock of the heel assists with the propulsive phase of gait, making walking more natural and less painful to the affected joints. Beneficiaries of this type of sole modification include people suffering from arthritis or any other disorder or injury causing pain and/or loss of motion in foot joints.|$|E

5000|$|Bolger is {{particularly}} {{known for his}} Square Boats (derogatorily known as [...] "Bolger Boxes"). Bolger reasoned that a simple <b>rockered</b> <b>bottom</b> and vertical sides gives the most volume, and form stability, on a given beam. After experimenting and studying traditional sharpies and the writings of small-boat historian Howard I. Chapelle and others, he developed {{the theory that the}} optimum chine line for a sailing sharpie should represent a regular curve without breaks, changes in radius or straight sections. He further reasoned that the curve of side and bottom should match as much as possible to reduce turbulence. He further reasoned that the sharpie was an ideal shape for a trailer sailer with either leeboards or bilgeboards to provide lateral plane. [...] Bolger felt that the traditional sharpie shape Chapelle had documented based on traditional New England sharpies (with a slightly different chine profile) was inefficient and prone to causing steering difficulties.|$|R

50|$|A rocker sole shoe or <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe is a shoe {{which has}} a thicker-than-normal sole with rounded heel.

5000|$|The Dour leads {{straight}} into the English Channel, so speculation has been made ever since its discovery about whether the Dover boat went to sea and sailed to the Continent. There is plenty of evidence that there was cross-Channel communication, {{but it is not}} known what kind of boats actually sailed across. Keith Miller, a regional archaeologist told the BBC that the older Ferriby Boats would have been used to cross the North Sea and certainly the Ferriby Heritage Trust describe Ferriby Boat 3 as Europe's first known seacraft. [...] The BBC television programme Operation Stonehenge: What Lies Beneath Pt 2, broadcast on BBC Two in September 2014, describes the boat as seagoing and describes the tons of cargo it could have taken across the Channel. However, The Dover Museum consider that the Dover Bronze Age Boat is the oldest seagoing boat known, at only 1550 BC. They are backed by a different channel and programme from the BBC- Neil Oliver in the Bronze Age episode of A History of Ancient Britain [...] They are also backed by the Time Team Special, broadcast in September 2014 on UK Channel 4, which stated that to be a proper sea-going, cross-channel vessel the boat would have to have the curved 'rocker' bottom and the (unproven) pointed bow that only the more modern Dover boat possesses. Confusingly, the Oakleaf reproduction of the Ferriby boats was given a pointed bow and the Ferriby boats are described by the museum that houses them as having curved <b>rocker</b> <b>bottoms,</b> which sounds much the same as the Dover boat.|$|R

5000|$|According to Steve Cook, {{executive}} director of the Midwest Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Association, an element of the dispute {{had to do with the}} right of Texas outlaw motorcycle clubs to wear jackets decorated with distinctive patches, including a geographic <b>bottom</b> <b>rocker</b> reading [...] "Texas", indicating Texas as the territory of the club. The dominant Bandidos claimed the right to approve all such jacket <b>bottom</b> <b>rocker</b> patches. A police affidavit released June 16 described the source of the conflict in similar terms. Following the shootout, police spokesman Patrick Swanton said a [...] between the rival clubs may have been a factor in the deadly encounter. It allegedly started following the beating of a Cossack by Bandidos at a Toys for Tots event in Decatur, Texas on December 6, 2014, and the killing of a member of the Ghostriders MC the next week in Fort Worth. Skirmishes over the issue continued on March 22, 2015. A police affidavit described fighting between Bandidos and Cossacks going back to November 2013, including brawls resulting in injuries, in Abilene, Palo Pinto County, and Lorena, Texas.

Affected individuals are not noticeably short at birth. Patients with pseudoachondroplasia present with gait abnormalities, lower limb deformity, or a retarded growth rate that characteristically appear at age 2-3 years. Disproportionate short stature is characterized by shortening of proximal limb segments (humeri and femora) also called rhizomelic shortening.

40|$|Background: Gait {{analysis}} after total ankle replacement {{and ankle}} arthrodesis is usually measured barefoot. However, {{this does not}} reflect reality. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare patients barefoot and with footwear. Methods: We compared 126 patients (total ankle replacement 28, ankle arthrodesis 57, and tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis 41) with 35 healthy controls in three conditions (barefoot, standardized running, and <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes). Minimum follow-up was 2 years. We used dynamic pedobarography and a light gate. Main outcome measures: relative midfoot index, forefoot maximal force, walking speed. Findings: The relative midfoot index decreased in all groups from barefoot to running shoes and again to <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes (p < 0. 001). The forefoot maximal force increased wearing shoes (p < 0. 001), but there was no difference between running and <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes. Walking speed increased by 0. 06 m/s with footwear (p < 0. 001). Total ankle replacement and ankle arthrodesis were equal in running shoes but both deviated from healthy controls (total ankle replacement/ankle arthrodesis smaller RMI p = 0. 07 / 0. 017; increased forefoot maximal force p = 0. 757 / 0. 862; slower walking speed p < 0. 001). In <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes, this ranking remained the same except the relative midfoot index merged to similar values. Tibiotalocalcaneal arthrodesis were inferior in both shoes. Interpretation: Runners are beneficial and the benefit is greater for fusions and replacements. <b>Rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes have little added benefit.

40|$|Surfboard {{design has}} always been a very {{personal}} thing. Shapers tend to be surfers themselves, and board design is as much an engineering feat as it is a love for surfing. Professional surfers work closely with shapers, as each surfer rides waves differently, and they know better than anyone how their surfboard needs to perform. The design process of a surfboard {{has always been}} a case of trial and error. A template is designed, and then experimented with in the water, then feedback is considered and alterations are made accordingly [1]. From surfboards carved from trees, weighing 100 pounds, and having the maneuverability of a log, the history of the surfboard has shown a great evolution in surfboard design and manufacturing [2]. There are many theories behind the practice of surfboard design. The surfboard has seen multiple generations of design enhancements since the movement started gathering momentum in the 19502 ̆ 7 s. However, new innovation peaked in the 1960 ’s and continues to evolve at a much slower pace. In fact, the industry has seen the return of balsa wood, long boards, and traditional shapes – a retro revival of sorts. The design of a surfboard still remains a fusion of ideas and instincts shared by the surfer and his or her shaper [3]. The surfboard design process begins with identifying the desires, needs, or goals of the surfer and his/her environment; identifying the variables (dimensions, <b>rockers,</b> <b>bottom</b> contours, deck contours, foils, templates, rails, fins, and more) in a specific technology (surfboard shaping and construction); hypothesizing arrangements of these variables (62 ̆ 7 22 ̆ 2 x 18 1 / 22 ̆ 2 x 2 3 / 82 ̆ 2, squash single to double concave, soft crown deck, moderate foil, soft thin round rail) through intuition and reasoning; testing the results of these arrangements (surfing and observation); and bringing new hypothesis into the process based on these tests and any new ideas that may develop. Surfboards may be grouped into several primary classes: Short boards, Specialty Short boards, Big Wave Guns, Hybrids, and Long boards [3]. This paper will explore the history and evolution of the surfboard, the composition and primary decision elements used in surfboard design, the major technology enhancements and branches of evolution, and provide a foundation {{that can be used to}} predict future technological enhancements in the surfboard industry...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine muscle a ctivity using EMG during {{treadmill}} wa lking wea ring a <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe. Recent literature sea rches have examined the use of <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes specifically examining pathologies such as RA, diabetes, pressure distribution and specific a natomical locations of the foot during gait (25). In addition, there has been research investigating the biomecha nical effects of using a <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoe with a mbulation (18). In recent yea rs the shoe compa ny Sketchers has presented claims that their "Shape-up" shoes (featuring a <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> sole) a re efficacious in "improving posture, reducing back stress, firming musculature of the buttocks, toning and firming thigh and calf muscles. The benefits of Shape-ups as claimed by Sketchers include efficient work out: wearing Shape-ups foot wear may result in more toned leg and buttock muscles. Higher Ca lorie burn: studies have shown that wea ring curved-bottom shoes like Sha pe-ups regula rly may help burn ca lories. Lower impact on joints: Sha pe-ups are designed to simulate a more natural walking surface a nd have superior cushioning to help a bsorb some of the impact on your joints. Improve posture: Sha pe-ups help train your body to stand stra ighter a nd taller as you walk"(26). The above claims were made by Skechers via the company website (www. Sketchers. com) prior to May of 2012. The cla ims have since been a ltered based on a lawsuit that the company misrepresented the benefits of wearing the rocker soled shoe. As physical therapy students, we wanted to know if the benefits of the claims made by Sketchers would be adva ntageous to increase muscle activity during ambulation for our patients. The purpose of our study is to use EMG to determine whether or not the claims made by the shoe compa ny a re in fact true. It is our hypothesis that the use of Shape-up shoes will not increase muscle activity of the lower extremities in subjects vs. the use of self­ selected athletic shoes...|$|E
40|$|Background: This study {{examined}} metabolic energy cost and external mechanical work for step-to-step transitions after tibiotalar arthrodesis, {{and the effect}} of MBT <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes. Methods: Oxygen uptake, forceplate and kinematic data were recorded in 18 controls and 15 patients while walking at a fixed speed of 1. 25 m/s in three walking conditions: barefoot, normal walking shoes and MBT <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes. Metabolic energy cost, external mechanical work, and the roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex were analyzed. Findings: Tibiotalar arthrodesis leads to higher metabolic energy cost during walking. During step-to-step transitions positive work during push-off with the impaired ankle was decreased but negative work during collision was not affected. The roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex did not differ between groups and shoe conditions. However, both in patients and controls <b>rocker</b> <b>bottom</b> shoes did lead to decreased positive work at push-off and increased negative work at collision and consequently higher metabolic energy cost of walking. Interpretation: External mechanical work for step-to-step transitions is not different between patients and controls and could not account for the higher metabolic energy cost in patients. Apparently, patients adopt a different walking strategy that limits step-to-step transition cost but nevertheless induces a higher metabolic energy cost. Despite restricted ankle movement, patients retain a normal roll-over shape of the ankle-foot complex. MBT shoes do not affect roll-over shape and appear to have a counterproductive effect on step-to-step transition cost and walking economy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
