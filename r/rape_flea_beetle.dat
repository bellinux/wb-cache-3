40|$|Three <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> species (Aphthona spp.), first {{introduced}} into North America in 1988, {{have come to}} be regarded as effective biological control organisms for leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula). The black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> (Aphthona lacertosa and A. czwalinae) in particular have been shown to cause reductions in leafy spurge stem counts in the northern Great Plains, while the brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> (A. nigriscutis) has persisted and spread, but has not been found to be as effective at controlling leafy spurge. The ability of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> to control leafy spurge in any given year, however, has been found to vary. To better understand the long-term effects of <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> herbivory on leafy spurge, we monitored stem counts of leafy spurge and numbers of black and brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> at three sites on two National Wildlife Refuges in east-central North Dakota, USA, from 1998 to 2006. Brown <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> numbers were observed to be negligible on these sites. Over the 9 years of the study, black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> were seen to spread over the three study sites and leafy spurge stem counts declined substantially on two of the three sites. Even at low densities of spurge, black <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> populations persisted, a necessary prerequisite for long-term control. We used structural equation models (SEM) to assess the yearly effects of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles,</b> soil texture, and refuge site on leafy spurge stem counts over this time period. We then used equations developed from the SEM analysis to explore flea beetle–leafy spurge dynamics over time, after controlling for soil texture and refuge. Yearly effect strength of black <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> on leafy spurge was found to be modest, largely owing to substantial spatial variability in control. However, simulation results based on prediction coefficients revealed leafy spurge to be highly responsive to increases in <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> populations on average...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} the biology {{and importance of}} the corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> vector {{and its role in}} the Stewart's disease of corn pathosystem. This was accomplished by determining the number of corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> generations that occur in Iowa and by quantifying the proportions of those populations found to be infested with the causal agent of Stewart's disease, pantoea stewartii. In addition, a preliminary study was conducted to determine how soil temperature was influenced by air temperature and how this may be applied to forecasting for Stewart's disease of corn. Research using yellow sticky cards and sweep netting demonstrated that there are overwintering, first, and second field generations of the corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> in Iowa. It was also observed that there was a period during June of both 1999 and 2000 when corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> were not found, which is important new management information. This research has also demonstrated that the incidence of P. stewartii-infested corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> can be monitored by ELISA testing and that the incidence fluctuates greatly throughout the corn growing season. The initial level of inoculum (P. stewartii-infested corn <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> in the adult overwintering generation) does not remain static during the spring as was previously hypothesized.

40|$|The <b>flea</b> <b>beetle,</b> Phyllotreta nemorum L. (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae), is an {{intermediate}} specialist feeding {{on a small}} number of plants within the family Brassicaceae. The most commonly used host plant is Sinapis arvensis L., whereas the species is found more rarely on Cardaria draba (L.) Desv., Barbarea vulgaris R. Br., and cultivated radish (Raphanus sativus L.). The interaction between <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> and Barbarea vulgaris ssp. arcuata (Opiz.) Simkovics seems to offer a good opportunity for experimental studies of coevolution. The plant is polymorphic, as it contains one type (the P-type) that is susceptible to all <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> genotypes, and another type (the G-type) that is resistant to some genotypes. At the same time, the <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> is also polymorphic, as some genotypes can utilize the G-type whereas others cannot. The ability to utilize the G-type of B. vulgaris ssp. arcuata is controlled by major dominant genes (R-genes). The present investigation measured the frequencies of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> with R-genes in populations living on different host plants in 2 years (1999 and 2003). Frequencies of beetles with R-genes were high in populations living on the G-type of B. vulgaris ssp. arcuata in both years. Frequencies of beetles with R-genes were lower in populations living on other host plants, and declining frequencies were observed in five out of six populations living on S. arvensis. Selection in favour of R-genes in populations living on B. vulgaris is the most likely mechanism to account for the observed differences in the relative abundance of R-genes in <b>flea</b> <b>beetle</b> populations utilizing different host plants.

Whereas resistant <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> are able to use B. vulgaris as well as other cruciferous plants as food, non-resistant beetles cannot survive on B. vulgaris. This limitation to host plant use of non-resistant beetles could potentially lead to asymmetric gene flow and some degree of genetic isolation between the different resistance-genotypes. Therefore, we studied the extent of genetic differentiation at neutral allozyme loci between samples of <b>flea</b> <b>beetles</b> that were collected at different locations and first tested for resistance phenotype. Since earlier work has shown a weak, but significant, effect of geographical distance between the samples on their genetic differentiation, in the present study variation at the neutral allozyme loci in P. nemorum was partitioned between geographical distance and resistance-phenotype.
