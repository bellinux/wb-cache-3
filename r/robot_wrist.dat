We {{present a}} system which can {{automatically}} home an upper torso humanoid robot so that its true joint angles are known using only information from a depth camera, coupled with incremental encoders.

The system uses exploratory moves to locate the robot’s end effector and to measure the pose of the <b>robot’s</b> <b>wrist</b> frame in camera space. Multiple measurements of the wrist frame pose are combined together in a kinematic calibration step to obtain the true joint angles and thus home the robot.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{discusses}} {{a strategy}} for a humanoid robot to pull a fire hose while walking towards a desired position and orientation. A hybrid controller on the <b>robot's</b> <b>wrist</b> holding the fire hose is implemented for pulling it. The proposed controller can automatically determine the pulling force according to the robot's walking velocity. Through simulation analysis it is shown that when the robot walks while pulling the fire hose a drift in the walking direction is generated. To cope with this drift and to direct the robot to a desired position and orientation, a walking task is introduced. Using a motion capture system, the robot's chest position and orientation are monitored and feed to the robot's walking pattern generator to correct the orientation drift and to determine where to walk and when to stop walking. Through experimental results {{the validity of the}} proposed strategy was confirmed.

30|$|In this research, {{the dynamic}} motion {{simulation}} of human lifting was planned as an optimization-based problem with 100 variables. Total lifting time was divided in 10 evenly distributed sequences. The {{first and last}} sequences {{are designed to be}} coincided with starting and finishing lifting time, so the initial and final postures are optimized by the algorithm and there’s no need to pre define these postures anymore. The novel body collision avoidance algorithm inspired from body self-awareness ability of human was implemented successfully in optimal motion planning framework. The basic idea is based on the automatic selection of body models with the respect to the posture predicted by the algorithm. Later, the model will be implemented in calculation of the desired position of <b>robot’s</b> <b>wrist</b> where box would not collide with the body. The lifting motion was generated using four biologically meaningful objective functions to evaluate the performance of the collision avoidance algorithm for motions with different dynamics.
