5|$|After the war, Schreiber {{remained}} at Los Alamos, {{where he became}} a group leader in the Weapon (W) Division. His first assignment was to ready bombs for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific. During the preparations, he witnessed the accident in which Louis Slotin was exposed to a fatal dose of neutron radiation when a screwdriver Slotin was using during a criticality experiment {{with one of the}} plutonium pits for Operation Crossroads slipped and the core went critical. Slotin would die from radiation poisoning nine days later but his quick reaction saved the lives of Schreiber and the others in the room (see also: demon core). Schreiber became an exponent of remote handling of dangerous substances, and designed <b>remote-control</b> machines to perform such experiments with all personnel at a quarter-mile distance.|$|E

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{official}} results were published shortly after midnight 28 December {{and it was}} clear the two candidates to face in a runoff would be Josipović and Bandić all the major candidates gave their speeches. Josipović called for voters to vote for the light, not for the dark, while Bandić insulted Josipović saying he was a pawn of Zoran Milanović and nothing more than his <b>remote-control.</b> The following morning the official campaign for the second round began. Josipović denied being an SDP project calling himself independent and accusing Bandić of being a <b>remote-control</b> of Ivo Sanader, referring among other things to claims by Dragan Primorac that Bandić was the favorite of the former prime minister. Bandić denied the rumors, however the following day the media published a story claiming that Bandić and Sanader had a secret lunch that very day in a Zagreb restaurant. Bandić denied the rumors calling the journalists who published the story liars, saying the media's favorite is Josipović and that they would do anything to discredit him.|$|E

25|$|The 1988 model line-up was revised, with sport coupe dropped due to low sales. The {{station wagon}} line-up {{was reduced to}} one model, an eight-passenger wagon. Engines {{remained}} unchanged, but the four-speed automatic overdrive transmission was standard on all engines and models. Standard equipment for all models included tinted glass, a <b>remote-control</b> driver's mirror, automatic headlight on/off, and an AM/FM stereo. A police version of the Caprice wagon was made; it had the code 1A2 and was designed for special service use.|$|E
25|$|In 1947, {{two years}} after the war ended, Calgary Power moved its head office from Montreal—then the nation's largest city and prime {{business}} center—to Calgary, reorganized, and incorporated as Calgary Power Ltd. At that time, Calgary Power supplied the province of Alberta with 99 percent of its hydroelectric power. Also in 1947, Calgary Power built its Barrier Hydro Plant and used it to test the use of a newly developed <b>remote-control</b> operation system. The automation efforts worked well enough that Calgary Power soon converted all of its plants to the Barrier Plant system. A control center that could operate the company's entire system was built in Seebe in 1951.|$|E

25|$|In December 1962, an {{all-weather}} {{radar and}} cyclone-warning station was opened at Saddle Mountain, near Kuranda, operated by <b>remote-control</b> from Cairns Airport. The station was recognised as a necessity to provide {{coverage of a}} 25-degree blind spot in the Townsville section of the Queensland Coast warning system after an unpredicted 1958 cyclone inflicted extensive damage {{to the town of}} Bowen. In 1963, the Barron Gorge Hydroelectric Power Station came online, and was linked to Townsville and Mackay via the Northern Power Grid, greatly increasing the available electrical supply for domestic and industrial requirements. A bulk sugar terminal was opened on the Cairns waterfront in October 1964, ensuring that the region's sugar industry would not be neglected.|$|E
25|$|Mass Effect: Andromeda was {{originally}} {{scheduled for release}} in late 2016, but its official release date was eventually moved to March 21, 2017 in North America and March 23 in Europe. In addition to the standard version of the game, players could also purchase a Deluxe Edition, which included in-game single and multiplayer bonuses, {{as well as a}} free soundtrack download. A Super Deluxe Edition was also made available, which added further multiplayer bonuses. For a short time, players could also order two versions of a Collector's Edition, one of which included a model of the in-game vehicle, the Nomad, while the second version included a <b>remote-control</b> Nomad.

25|$|In 1903, Leonardo Torres Quevedo {{presented}} the Telekino at the Paris Academy of Science, {{accompanied by a}} brief, and making an experimental demonstration. In {{the same time he}} obtained a patent in France, Spain, Great Britain, and the United States. The Telekino consisted of a robot that executed commands transmitted by electromagnetic waves. With the Telekino, Torres-Quevedo laid down modern wireless <b>remote-control</b> operation principles and was a pioneer in the field of remote control. In 1906, {{in the presence of the}} king and before a great crowd, Torres successfully demonstrated the invention in the port of Bilbao, guiding a boat from the shore. Later, he would try to apply the Telekino to projectiles and torpedoes, but had to abandon the project for lack of financing. The first remote-controlled model aeroplane flew in 1932, and the use of remote control technology for military purposes was worked intensively during the Second World War, one result of this being the German Wasserfall missile.|$|E

25|$|Ivo Josipović gave a short speech {{after the}} exit polls were {{announced}} saying he was confident the official results would match the results they predicted. After the official results were published, he gave a victory speech shortly after midnight thanking his colleagues and especially his voters for their support and expressed conviction {{he would be the}} victor once again two weeks later. He said the citizens of Croatia have a choice between the light and the dark, with him being the light, referring to his untarnished political record, and Bandić being the dark, referring to his allegations of corruption. Milan Bandić arrived to his campaign headquarters {{just a couple of minutes}} before midnight and just a couple of minutes after the results were announced he gave his speech. He congratulated all the other candidates and said a new race began that night. He said he would be an independent president, not a <b>remote-control</b> of Zoran Milanović and accused Josipović of being a project of the highest-ranking members of SDP. He claimed Croatia needs a president that works for them, not for his party. While he was speaking, most television networks were showing scenes from Josipović headquarters in the corner, with Milanović observing Bandić's remarks. During the middle of his speech, right when Bandić was bashing his former party and its leader, Josipović came to the stage and all television stations switched to hear what he had to say.|$|E

40|$|This article {{deals with}} the {{construction}} of a vehicle driven by electric motors and that is automated, that is, that can move anywhere without human intervention. The control was done using the software Labview, with data acquisition and generation of control signs. The vehicle has an infrared sensors system that indicates the existence of an obstacle ahead the vehicle, informing it that it should stop and bypass the obstacle. The program is the responsible for the engine control, making it possible for the prototype to run and bypass the objects that block its way. The possibility of <b>remote-controlling</b> a vehicle is very important is risky situations for human beings, for example in radioactive places. The main advantage of this system is the total flexibility for making alterations in the control software, without being necessary to touch the physical part of the prototype.
