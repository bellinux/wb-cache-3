40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> ductile <b>crack</b> {{extension}} {{is discussed}} in terms CTOA. Selection of CTOA {{is based on the}} reduced number of parameters and the low sensitivity to pipe geometry. Numerical simulations of crack propagation and arrest based on CTOA use the node release technique, which is described. Results on a pipe made in steel API L,X 52, X 65 and X 100 are presented. The influence material parameters on crack arrest and velocity using this technique are presented. For the same decompression wave pressure, the crack propagation velocity is inversely proportional <b>to</b> the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> extension of the material, which is the dominant parameter.

40|$|The {{relation}} of microstructure to the mechanical strength and stress corrosion resistance of highest strength and overaged tempers of BAR and 7050 aluminum alloys was investigated. Comparison {{is made with}} previously studied 7075 aluminum alloy. Optical microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry were used to characterize the grain morphology, matrix microstructure, and grain boundary microstructure of these tempers. Grain boundary interparticle spacing was significant <b>to</b> stress corrosion <b>crack</b> propagation for all three alloys; increasing interparticle spacing led <b>to</b> increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> propagation.

50|$|Trivex is a {{relative}} newcomer that possesses the UV-blocking properties and shatter resistance of polycarbonate {{while at the same}} time offering far superior optical quality (i.e., higher Abbe value) and a slightly lower density. Its lower refractive index of 1.532 vs. polycarbonate's 1.586 may result in slightly thicker lenses depending upon the prescription. Along with polycarbonate and the various high-index plastics, Trivex is a lab favorite for use in rimless frames, owing to the ease with which it can be drilled and its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> around the drill holes.

50|$|About 56 of the Old World {{species and}} 3 of the New World species (pheasant, pavonine, and striped) are brood parasites, laying their {{eggs in the}} nests of other birds. These species are obligate brood parasites, meaning that they only {{reproduce}} in this fashion. The best-known example is the European common cuckoo. In addition to the above noted species, yet others sometimes engage in non-obligate brood parasitism, laying their eggs in the nests of {{members of their own}} species in addition to raising their own young. The shells of the eggs of brood-parasites are usually thick. They have two distinct layers with an outer chalky layer that is believed to provide <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>cracking</b> when the eggs are dropped in the host nest. The cuckoo egg hatches earlier than the host's, and the cuckoo chick grows faster; in most cases the chick evicts the eggs or young of the host species.

The chick encourages the host to keep pace with its high growth rate with its rapid begging call and the chick's open mouth which serves as a sign stimulus.|$|E

30|$|Most {{artificial}} joints consist of two metal surfaces, commonly made of cobalt chromium molybdenum (Co–Cr–Mo) alloy and an insert, commonly made of ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). The mechanical properties {{of these two}} materials are influenced by several chemical and physical factors. Oxidation breaks down the molecular chains in UHMWPE resulting in increased brittleness and reduced <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> propagation. Historically, there have been unfortunate consequences within {{artificial joints}} when unexpected and unwanted chemical or physical reactions led to severe wear and joint failure. One example arose from the storage of artificial implants in air-filled packets after sterilisation using gamma radiation. This mode of storage led to gradual oxidation of the UHMWPE and deterioration of its mechanical properties. This was partly overcome by storage within a vacuum-sealed packet. Another example was post-irradiation thermal treatment to reduce free radicals in the polyethylene. This could cause a partial reduction in crystallinity of the material that, in turn, reduced the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>crack</b> propagation [1].|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn some {{industrial}} applications, {{the need}} to improve the thermal shock resistance of refractories by optimisation of their microstructural design is of major importance.

The present work aimed at studying the influence of thermal micro-damage within the microstructure released during the cooling process on the nonlinearity of the mechanical behaviour in tension. The two-phase composites considered were magnesia-spinel refractories with different spinel inclusions content allowing to modulate the micro-damage level. Two different destructive mechanical tests, namely tensile and wedge splitting tests, were performed and their results were compared. The influence of thermal damage on different relevant mechanical parameters was investigated, and a quantitative correlation analysis between these parameters was proposed...|$|R
