Therefore, in maize breeding, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring resistance are important for controlling the disease. Next-generation sequencing technologies are considered a rapid and efficient method to establish the association of agronomic traits with molecular markers or candidate genes. In the present study, we employed QTL-seq, which is a whole-genome resequencing-based approach, to identify candidate genomic regions conferring resistance to maize stalk <b>rot.</b> A novel <b>resistance</b> QTL Rgsr 8. 1 was finely mapped, conferring broad-spectrum resistance to Gibberella stalk rot (GSR). Segregation analysis in F 2 and BC 1 F 1 populations, which were derived from a cross between 18327 (Susceptible) and S 72356 (Resistant), indicated that the resistance to GSR {{was likely to be}} a quantitatively inherited trait in maize. The result of QTL-seq showed that the resistance to GSR was mapped on chromosome 8 from 161. 001 to 170. 6 Mb.

40|$|Medium {{to large}} seeded kabuli chickpeas {{can be a}} {{profitable}} option for chickpea growers, particularly in south eastern Australia (1). A considerable price premium generally exists for grain greater than 8 mm compared to desi and small seeded kabulis (6 - 7 mm). Historically Australia’s medium to large seeded varieties have required favourable spring conditions to achieve good yields and seed size greater than 8 mm. In years with short seasons or dry springs, the larger seeded kabuli varieties performed poorly and were therefore considered unreliable and risky, particularly in low to medium rainfall environments. Following the outbreak of Ascochyta blight (AB) in the late 1990 ’s, the subsequent seven kabuli varieties released were all bred at the International Centre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA). These varieties provided the required AB resistance and acceptable adaptation, particularly the smaller seeded varieties Genesis™ 090 and Genesis™ 079. The first Australian bred kabuli variety was PBA Monarch released in 2012. PBA Monarch is a medium sized kabuli with early flowering and maturity providing significantly improved yields over current medium and large seeded varieties in short season environments such as the South Australian Yorke Peninsula, Mid North and Victorian Mallee. However its plant type can be prone to lodging under high biomass and it is moderately susceptible to AB. The Pulse Breeding Australia (PBA) Chickpea program has made {{a concerted effort to}} combine improved seed size, AB resistance, erect plant type and earlier maturity using PBA Monarch, elite PBA breeding lines and international germplasm. New breeding lines have been developed and evaluated in yield trials in South Australia, Victoria and northern New South Wales. Multienvironment (MET) analyses were used to identify lines with superior yields and examine how individual environments correlate. The 2015 season featured a very short spring and a number of medium to large seeded lines were identified with increased yield compared to PBA Monarch with an erect plant type. Although some lines had exceptional yields only in the short season 2015 trials, other lines demonstrated wide adaptation and improved yield stability with superior yields in the 2015 trials as well as longer season 2014 trials. Assessment of AB resistance has also occurred and a number of these early maturing high yielding breeding lines have increased AB resistance compared to PBA Monarch. The development of medium and large seeded kabulis with superior yield and adaptation will provide more reliable and profitable varieties for south eastern Australian chickpea growers. The next challenge for the PBA Chickpea program is to improve the Phytophthora root <b>rot</b> (PRR) <b>resistance</b> to elite adapted breeding lines to provide growers in north eastern Australia improved opportunities in kabuli chickpea production...|$|R

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyDepartment of AgronomyTesfaye TessoSweet Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] {{is a type}} of {{cultivated}} sorghum grown {{primarily for}} its sugar-rich stalks. Because of its high fermentable sugar content, the crop is widely recognized as an alternative feedstock source for bio-fuel production. The extent to which stalk sugar accumulation occurs may be determined by several factors including the sink size. Grain is the most important sink in sorghum and other grain crops. Three experiments were conducted in this study {{to determine the extent to}} which the grain sink can reduce sugar accumulation in the stalks, to test and validate a genetic system that allows development of sterile sweet sorghum hybrids, and to assess the potential of sugar-rich hybrids to overcome stalk rot diseases. The first experiment, based on 22 sweet sorghum genotypes, was undertaken to study the effect of eliminating the grain sink (removing the head prior to anthesis) on stalk juice yield, sugar accumulation, and biomass. The data showed that the grain sink had a significant effect on all traits measured. Elimination of the grain sink significantly increased oBrix % (17. 8 %), dry biomass (27. 8 %), juice yield (23. 9 %), and total sugar yield (43. 5 %). The second experiment was aimed at validating the role of A 3 genetic male sterility system for producing sterile sweet sorghum hybrids. Ten sweet sorghum pollinator lines of variable sugar content were selected among the entries included in the previous experiment. The lines were crossed to four A 1 and A 3 cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) lines using a Design II mating scheme. The A 3 females did not have effective restorers so that the hybrids were expected to be sterile. The parental lines and corresponding hybrids were evaluated for biomass production, oBrix, juice and sugar yield using a randomized complete block design. All A 3 hybrids were sterile and did not produce seed when heads were covered prior to pollination. The effect of grain sink represented by the A 1 vs. A 3 CMS were highly significant for Brix%, biomass, juice, and sugar yield. Comparison of parents vs. crosses component was highly significant, indicating marked heterosis effect for the traits. Both general (GCA) and specific (SCA) combining ability effects were also significant for all traits, indicating the role of both additive and dominance genetic effects in the inheritance of the characters. Earlier studies have shown positive relationships between stalk sugar concentration and stalk <b>rot</b> disease <b>resistance</b> in sorghum. Thus, the objective of the third experiment was to study the effects of the CMS mediated differential accumulation of stalk sugar on severity of charcoal rot disease caused by Macrophomina phaseolina. The experiment provided an opportunity to test the effect of variable stalk sugar in the same genetic backgrounds. The data indicated that hybrids produced from A 3 cytoplasm were more resistant to charcoal rot (7. 1 cm lesion length) compared to those produced from the A 1 hybrids (9. 5 cm lesion length). The enhanced resistance of hybrids with higher sugar yield could have significant agronomic advantage in sugar based bio-fuel feedstock production...|$|R
40|$|Although maize {{was early}} {{recognized}} as an excellent forage plant soon after its introduction in Europe, during a long time it was only bred for grain traits. However, the first recommendations of maize varieties for specific forage use are probably those given in the French VILMORIN-ANDRIEUX catalogues {{as early as the}} second mid of the 19 th century. The 1940 Dutch variety list distinguished several types of maize varieties and was already recommending three varieties for silage use. Whereas US hybrids were introduced in Europe in the early 1950 s, the significant extension of silage maize cropping began after the release of early flint x dent hybrids such as INRA 258 (1958) and a little later Brillant DK 202, Capella, LG 11, and Blizzard G 188 (between 1965 and 1975). The increase went on until 1990, with a decrease or stabilization following. The first generation of early European maize hybrids was mostly often based on crosses between flint Lacaune and dent Minnesota 13 lines. The registration of Dea (1980) in France and a few years later Golda in Germany both illustrated tremendous changes in maize dent, {{and to a lesser extent}} flint, germplasm and marked the onset of a second era in European maize hybrid breeding. Iodent and BSSS origins were thus substituting for Minnesota 13. Correlatively, the era of 1980 s was also marked by significant improvement of hybrid earliness. The actual maize breeding is characterized by a significantly greater introgression of medium late germplasm into early dent and flint maize lines. The beginning of this last period may be dated by the registration of Banguy (1992). The average genetic improvement in whole plant yield was close to 0. 10 t/ha. year during the period between 1958 and 1988, but reached 0. 17 t/ha. year between 1986 and 2004. In early maize, highly significant improvements of stalk standability, stalk <b>rot</b> and lodging <b>resistance</b> have been achieved between 1950 and 2004 in Europe. Physiological changes associated to these improvements are at least delayed senescence of leaves and stems, higher grain filling rate, and higher stress tolerance.

The advantages of fibre composites over traditional construction materials, is their high strength, light weight, less corrosive, durable, and most importantly, no decay / deterioration by natural organisms, which is the dominant problem for timber piles used in water front structures. This research project, focused {{on the development of}} a system for decayed timber piles replacement, for piers, jetties, bridges and boardwalks, using fibre composite technology to enable rehabilitation of the structures, as well as new construction, by using Glass Fibre Reinforced Polymer (GFRP) tubular pile and connector. Three objectives were considered to examine the structural behaviour of GFRP tubular piles and connector used for novel timber pile rehabilitation technique. As the first objective, the effects of various loading scenarios on the capacity of the GFRP hollow tubular piles were investigated. Then as a second objective, numerical simulations were performed using the finite element analysis approach to verify experiments, and study the behaviour of the overall pile rehabilitation system. Based on the results of these numerical simulations, further research areas were highlighted for filler material development, which was used to fill the space between the GFRP connector and the existing timber pile. Due to durability, pumpability, workability and compressive strength requirements, polyester resin based filler development was chosen. As the third objective, appropriate polyester based filler materials were developed for the GFRP tubular connector, to transfer the vertical load from the super structure, to the original timber stump, by the connector. A research program has been initiated to improve the fundamental understanding of this rehabilitation concept. A new polyester based filler material has been considered to provide the working knowledge required for its broad utilisation. Fibre composites have not been used in this specific manner previously. While there have been fibre composite wraps developed, these are not the replacement systems, and have inherent weaknesses in their application, being more difficult to install, and needing to be highly tailored to specific instances. The concept developed, tested and verified in this study is viable for general timber pile rehabilitations in piers / jetties with reasonable factor of safety and will be possible to extended rural two lane timber bridges. The results of this research, reveals a system, designed from an engineering perspective, relatively simple to install. Further, it is favourably disposed to mass production processes, to gain efficiencies of scale. Finally, this targeted research project, uncovers a timber pile rehabilitation system, capable of accepting the full working loads, while also ensuring a life span of some 50 - 100 years, with minimal maintenance. ...|$|R
