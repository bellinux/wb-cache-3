30|$|Since last 70  years, {{to carry}} the load of the {{structures}} namely three types of foundation system were used such as <b>raft</b> <b>foundations,</b> pile and piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> where former has limited to the rise building and later have used in high rise building. For pile and piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations,</b> different drilling fluids are used to stabilize bore hole such as bentonite and polymer. Mineral slurries are the commonly used drilling fluids, for the stabilization of the borehole in various constructions such as pile foundation, diaphragm wall panels etc. Bentonite being economical has been the most commonly used mineral slurry. Bentonite regains its strength due to remolding, when allowed to hydrate in water as it shows a thixotropic behavior with time thus bentonite particles form an impermeable layer of filter cake around the exposed soil layer which helps in borehole stabilization. The ultimate bearing capacity of a pile foundation is the sum of end bearing resistance as well as frictional resistance around its shaft, but various researchers have shown that the frictional resistance offered by the pile is found to be reduced due to the formation of a soft layer with the use of bentonite as a borehole stabilizer which is required to be formed to keep the soil intact in the borehole, thus indulges in compromising with the reduction in the overall ultimate load carrying capacity of the pile. Another problem associated with the bentonite, it is geo-hazards and leads to disposal problems. This {{led to the development of}} material, such as polymer fluids which helps in stabilizing the borehole without significantly affecting the frictional resistance of the pile. To stabilize the bore hole it was found that higher percentage of bentonite is required to achieve desired properties of fluid as compared to polymer as the required parameters suggested by the IS code for bentonite fluid. One of the traditional reasons behind switching from bentonite to polymer is its operational benefit. There are certain sites where it becomes difficult to construct a separate bentonite plant due to space restrictions thereby leading to the use of polymer as drilling fluid.|$|E
40|$|A piled raft is a {{composite}} foundation in which the piles are used as settlement reducers and they share, with the raft, the load from the superstructure. The applied load is transferred from the raft to the shallow soil and to the pile heads, and from the piles it is diffused through the shaft and the base to deeper soil. The pile–raft and pile–pile interactions represent the distinctive aspect of the piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> since they modify the load–bearing behaviour of each foundation component, compared to an analogous isolated element, thus determining the overall foundation behaviour. The main aim of this thesis is to highlight {{the effects of the}} raft–soil–pile interactions on the resistance and stiffness of axially loaded piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> in sand. A series of centrifuge tests on models of rigid circular piled rafts in loose saturated sand has been performed to this end, employing both non displacement and displacement piles. The raft settlement and the load transmitted to the pile heads and bases were monitored during the tests, which also included unpiled raft and isolated pile tests. The test results have been analysed in terms of bearing capacity and stiffness; the former according to a load efficiency method, the latter by comparing the values obtained from centrifuge tests with those evaluated through a simplified analytical method. ii Modelling of Piled <b>Raft</b> <b>Foundations</b> in Sand D. Giretti In order to clarify the effect of the pressure transmitted by the raft to the soil on the behaviour of a single capped pile, some of the centrifuge tests were simulated via finite element numerical analyses, using an elasto–plastic strain hardening constitutive model for the sand.

40|$|This thesis {{considers}} the reuse and the optimum design of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> using numerical analysis. The solution proposed for reusing foundations is {{the design of}} a piled raft foundation capable of supporting successive buildings. A raft foundation, with a limited number of piles located strategically beneath the raft and utilising a high proportion of the ultimate load capacity, is considered the most efficient design when the raft foundation alone provides sufficient load capacity, {{but at the same time}} settlements are excessive. This is the case in high plasticity stiff clays such as London Clay. When building on old piles, these piles had to sustain a certain load from the previous structure over a period of time, during which the soil is subjected to the time-related processes of consolidation and creep. A time dependent constitutive model, capable of reproducing several aspects of the time dependent behaviour of soils including creep and isotach viscosity, is employed in the finite element analyses. The model parameters are calibrated with the results of laboratory tests on London Clay, whose time dependent behaviour in its natural state is characterised by isotach viscosity, rate dependent peak strength and rate independent critical state line. Preliminary analyses of single piles indicate that the consolidation processes in the ground result in little gain in capacity in the long term, whereas creep results in increased capacity. A back-analysis of documented piled load tests in London Clay is performed, where the effects of pile installation are quantified. Numerical model calibration is performed with the documented observations of a well instrumented piled raft foundation at Stonebridge Park, London. 3 D parametric analyses of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> are then performed, in order to assess the appropriate location and dimensions of piles and raft thickness. The performance of piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations</b> with time is assessed parametrically at different levels of preloading.

In piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundations,</b> the bearing capacity of the underlying soil is taken into account to support the superstructure loads and the piles are placed such that they increase the bearing capacity of the raft and control both the total and differential settlements of the superstructure. In the city of Kerman, Iran, the predominance of soft soils had historically hampered the construction of high-rise buildings across the city. Recently, an eighteen-story reinforced concrete building was constructed on a micropiled-raft foundation which was placed on a 30 m-thick layer of soft saturated calcareous silty soil. Conventional laboratory and plate loading test results on the foundation soil indicated that a raft foundation would have adequate bearing capacity, but would experience excessive settlements. As a remedial solution, a micropiled-raft foundation system was considered as a design option for the foundation of the structure. A prototype micropile was designed and installed based on the FHWA (2000) guidelines and tested at the site. The test results were used to design the micropiled raft foundation using a finite element program.

In this study, the raft, piles and supporting soil are modeled by a 3 D finite element program. Using pile raft with different pile diameters in all types of soils, with unequal applied loads, has better operation than piled raft system with similar piles. But its behavior is not the same in all soils. Results show that the piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundation</b> with different pile diameters may be a good solution to reduce total and differential settlements if the bottom layer is a dense soil. If the bottom layer be a soft soil, using piled <b>raft</b> <b>foundation</b> with different pile diameters can’t {{be a good way to}} control maximum and differential settlement of raft system and structure. In this case, using other ways such as piled raft system with different lengths piles may be a good attitude to control the maximum and differential settlements...|$|R
