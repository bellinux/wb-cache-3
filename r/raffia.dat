5|$|Clothing was {{historically}} {{made from}} woven <b>raffia.</b> The fibers would be combed into strands that were knotted {{together to form}} cords, which were then woven into panels. These panels were stitched together to create prayer rugs and clothing. Women and men historically wore long <b>raffia</b> smocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{indigenous}} <b>raffia</b> {{plant was}} the base fiber for the clothing traditionally {{worn by the}} Betsimisaraka. Leaves of the <b>raffia</b> plant were combed to separate the fibers, which were knotted end to end to form strands that could then be woven together to form cloth. Among the various peoples who united under the Betsimisaraka confederation, women wore a short wrapper (simbo), typically with a bandeau top (akanjo), while men wore smocks. Traditional <b>raffia</b> clothing is still worn by some Betsimisaraka today.|$|E
5|$|Banton has a {{primarily}} agricultural economy, with copra {{farming and}} fishing {{as the main}} sources of livelihood. There is also an indigenous <b>raffia</b> palm handicraft industry. Other crops grown in the island are root crops (such as cassava, sweet potatoes), fruits and vegetables. The locals also engage in livestock raising for local consumption, and small-scale shipbuilding of wooden boats and launches.|$|E
5|$|Madagascar's natural {{resources}} include {{a variety of}} unprocessed agricultural and mineral resources. Agriculture (including <b>raffia),</b> fishing and forestry are mainstays of the economy. Madagascar is the world's principal supplier of vanilla, cloves and ylang-ylang. Other key agricultural resources include coffee, lychees and shrimp. Key mineral resources include various types of precious and semi-precious stones, and Madagascar currently provides half of the world's supply of sapphires, which were discovered near Ilakaka in the late 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} food {{eaten in}} Sihanaka {{has long been}} rice, which they cultivate heavily. The rice based diet was supplemented by {{a wide range of}} game and other meats, including lemurs, wild boars, snakes, owls, rats, cats and crocodile, the latter having at one time been protected by a fady that was eventually abandoned. Use of tobacco or marijuana and consumption of pork were commonly forbidden in Sihanaka families. Many believed that transporting swine across Lake Alaotra would bring storms. Their traditional dress consisted of clothing woven of <b>raffia</b> fibers.|$|E
5|$|Banton {{is thought}} to be already {{inhabited}} by Filipinos since the pre-colonial period, based on analysis of discovered human remains, coffins, an ancient burial cloth and other archaeological finds by the National Museum in the 1930s. The present settlement was founded in 1622 by the Spanish and is the oldest settlement in the province. During the American colonial period, the municipality changed its name to Jones in honor of American congressman William Jones, who authored the Philippine Autonomy Act of 1916. Today, Banton is one of Romblon's thriving municipalities, with an economy dependent on copra farming, fishing, <b>raffia</b> palm weaving, and tourism.|$|E
5|$|The {{plastic arts}} are also {{widespread}} throughout the island. In {{addition to the}} tradition of silk weaving and lamba production, the weaving of <b>raffia</b> and other local plant materials {{has been used to}} create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats. Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market. The decorative and functional woodworking traditions of the Zafimaniry people of the central highlands was inscribed on UNESCO's list of Intangible Cultural Heritage in 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{teaching}} of Eskayan in the volunteer schools {{is one of}} the few remaining cultural practices of the Eskaya community. Formerly, Eskaya men would wear shirts made of piña <b>raffia</b> with a Chinese-style collar, black breeches, and cotton berets. Women wore piña dresses with bulging sleeves similar to the Spanish-influenced Boholano style (mostly in Biabas) and covered their hair with cotton habits (mostly in Taytay). Traditionally, women were not permitted to cut their hair short nor wear trousers, and drinking and dancing were universally prohibited. For the most part these customs have been discontinued, however traditional dress is sometimes worn on Sundays and special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Arab and Islamic {{influences}} strongly mark Antemoro culture. Traditionally, Antemoro men's clothing {{included a}} turban or fez style hat and long, loose robes {{similar to those}} worn in {{many other parts of}} the Muslim world. Harefo reeds were woven to form mats (tafitsihy) that were sewn together to form jackets and tunics (with long sleeves for older men); a loincloth made of fanto (beaten barkcloth) was worn beneath the ensemble. Women wore sleeveless sheath dresses made from two or three reed mats sewn together and belted at the waist or drawn over one shoulder. Adolescent and adult women often also wore a mat bandeau or halter top. It was historically forbidden for women to wear lambas made of cotton or any other material than woven <b>raffia</b> mats, as it was believed this could render them more attractive to men outside their clan, with whom they were forbidden to marry.|$|E
25|$|Arecaceae {{have great}} {{economic}} importance, including coconut products, oils, dates, palm syrup, ivory nuts, carnauba wax, rattan cane, <b>raffia,</b> and palm wood.|$|E
25|$|Sudan savanna {{forms the}} {{dominant}} vegetation. This consists of grassfields—leading {{to the name}} Bamenda grassfields around the city of Bamenda—and short shrubs and trees that shed their foliage {{during the dry season}} as a defence against brush fires and dry weather. <b>Raffia</b> palms grow in the valleys and depressions.|$|E
25|$|Tradition {{settlements}} in the Centre are placed along roads, resulting in large numbers of houses near the road with forest beginning directly behind them. The traditional house is a rectangular structure made of mud bricks and thin, wooden or bamboo posts. Roofs were mostly thatched <b>raffia</b> palm in the past, but they are more often made of corrugated aluminium, iron, or tin today.|$|E
25|$|The {{rationing}} {{system also}} applied to clothing: leather was reserved exclusively for German army boots, and vanished completely from the market. Leather shoes {{were replaced by}} shoes made of rubber or canvas (<b>raffia)</b> with wooden soles. A variety of ersatz or substitute products appeared, which were not {{exactly what they were}} called: ersatz wine, coffee (made with chicory), tobacco and soap.|$|E
25|$|In West Africa, the wet phase {{ushered in}} an {{expanding}} rainforest and wooded savanna from Senegal to Cameroon. Between 9000 and 5000 BC, Niger–Congo speakers domesticated the oil palm and <b>raffia</b> palm. Two seed plants, black-eyed peas and voandzeia (African groundnuts), were domesticated, followed by okra and kola nuts. Since {{most of the}} plants grew in the forest, the Niger–Congo speakers invented polished stone axes for clearing forest.|$|E
25|$|The Western High Plateau {{was once}} heavily forested. However, {{repeated}} cutting and burning {{by human beings}} has forced the forest back to areas along the waterways and has allowed grasslands to expand into the area. Sudan savanna forms the dominant vegetation. This consists of grassfields—leading to the name Bamenda grassfields around the city of Bamenda—and short shrubs and trees that shed their foliage {{during the dry season}} as a defence against brush fires and dry weather. <b>Raffia</b> palms grow in the valleys and depressions.|$|E
25|$|Bikinis {{have been}} made out of just about every {{material}} known. The fabrics and other materials used to make bikinis are {{an essential element of}} their style and crucial modifiers of swimsuit design. The use of cotton made the swimsuit more practical, and the increased reliance on stretch fabric after 1960 simplified construction; alternative swimwear fabrics such as velvet, leather, and crocheted squares surfaced in the early 1970s. Crochet, lace, PVC, <b>raffia,</b> fur, latex, velvet and other uncommon items are also used as bikini material.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{attribute}} their {{introduction to}} the ancient Phoenicians who traded along {{the west coast of}} Africa or even early Carthaginian explorers and traders. The Egyptians have also been suggested as they used penannular money. One interesting suggestion is that Nigerian fishermen brought them up in their nets from the shipwrecks of European wrecks or made them from the copper 'pins' used in wooden sailing ships wrecked in the Bight of Benin. One theory is that if indigenous, they copied a splayed-end <b>Raffia</b> cloth bracelet worn by women, another that the well-known Yoruba Mondua with its bulbous ends inspired the manilla shape.|$|E
25|$|The Arecaceae are notable among monocots {{for their}} height {{and for the}} size of their seeds, leaves, and inflorescences. Ceroxylon quindiuense, Colombia's {{national}} tree, is the tallest monocot in the world, reaching up to 60m tall. The coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica) has the largest seeds of any plant, 40–50cm in diameter and weighing 15–30kg each. <b>Raffia</b> palms (Raphia spp.) have the largest leaves of any plant, up to 25m long and 3m wide. The Corypha species have the largest inflorescence of any plant, up to 7.5m tall and containing millions of small flowers. Calamus stems can reach 200m in length.|$|E
25|$|Calamoideae also {{includes}} tree palms such as Raphia (<b>Raffia)</b> and Metroxylon (Sago palm) and shrub palms such as Salacca (Salak) (Uhl & Dransfield 1987 Genera Palmarum). The climbing habit in palms is {{not restricted to}} Calamoideae, but has also evolved in three other evolutionary lines—tribes Cocoeae (Desmoncus with c. 7–10 species in the New World tropics) and Areceae (Dypsis scandens in Madagascar) in subfamily Arecoideae, and tribe Hyophorbeae (climbing species of the large genus Chamaedorea in Central America) in subfamily Ceroxyloideae. They do not have spinose stems and climb by means of their reflexed terminal leaflets. Of these only Desmoncus spp. furnish stems of sufficiently good quality {{to be used as}} rattan cane substitutes.|$|E
25|$|Traditional {{arts are}} based on the {{creative}} use of local and natural materials. The tradition of silk weaving and lamba production exemplifies this form of art. The weaving of <b>raffia</b> and other local plant materials has been used to create a wide array of practical items such as floor mats, baskets, purses and hats. Wood carving is a highly developed art form, with distinct regional styles evident in the decoration of balcony railings and other architectural elements. Sculptors create a variety of furniture and household goods, aloalo funerary posts, and wooden sculptures, many of which are produced for the tourist market.

25|$|By the 15th century AD, {{the farming}} Bakongo people (ba being the plural prefix) were unified as the Kingdom of Kongo under a ruler called the manikongo, {{residing}} in the fertile Pool Malebo area on the lower Congo River. The capital was M'banza-Kongo. With superior organization, {{they were able to}} conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving <b>raffia</b> cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the manikongo. Later, maize (corn) and cassava (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the Portuguese at their ports at Luanda and Benguela. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing millet as a main staple.|$|E
25|$|A year later, Portuguese {{reinforcements}} from Brazil {{forced the}} Dutch to surrender Luanda and withdraw from Angola in 1648. The new Portuguese governor, Salvador de Sá, sought terms with Kongo, demanding the Island of Luanda, {{the source of}} Kongo's money supply of nzimbu shells. Although neither Kongo nor Angola ever ratified the treaty, sent to the king in 1649, the Portuguese gained de facto control of the island. The war resulted in the Dutch losing their claims in Central Africa, Nzinga being forced back into Matamba, the Portuguese restored to their coastal position. Kongo lost or gained nothing, other than the indemnity Garcia paid, which ended hostilities between the two rival powers. King Garcia II, after allowing the Portuguese to gain control over Luanda Island, switched the kingdom's currency to <b>raffia</b> cloth, seemingly negating the Portuguese gains.|$|E
25|$|Within the earth's spherical limit, in a cosmological sense, is a {{designation}} of the 'earth's bosom' within, ímé àlà, a hemispherical base {{to the earth}} with an opening or 'mouth' at its highest point, ónụ́ àlà. This is composed of mainly deep dark sea water (ohimiri). Ime ala is considered as the underworld. Ala in addition to embodying nature, is the cosmic base on which the vault of heaven, ígwé, rests. As the foundation of all existence, children's umbilical cords are saved and symbolically buried under a tree to mark the child's first sharing of family owned lands; this tree could either be an oil palm, bread-fruit tree, <b>raffia</b> palm, or plantain tree depending on the cultural region. In some places, such as Nri, the royal python, éké, is considered a sacred and tame agent of Ala and a harbinger of good fortune when found in a home. The python {{is referred to as}} nne 'mother' in areas where the python is revered, it is a symbol of female beauty and gentleness. Killing of the python is expressly forbidden in these places and sanctions are taken against the killer including the funding of expensive human sized burials that are given to slain pythons.|$|E
25|$|After the {{dispersal}} {{of the family}} of kings and queens, the aborigines became ungovernable, and constituted themselves into a serious threat to the survival of Ife. Thought to be supporters of Obatala who had ruled the land before the arrival of Oduduwa, these people turned themselves into marauders. They would come to town in costumes made of <b>raffia</b> with terrible and fearsome appearances, and burn down houses and loot the markets. It is at this point that Moremi Ajasoro, a princess of Offa, of the lineage of Olalomi Olofagangan, the founder of Offa-Ile and the paramount head of Ibolo region of old Oyo kingdom, of Ooduan dynasty by Oranmiyan, is said to have come onto the scene; she subsequently {{played a significant role in}} restoring normalcy back to the situation through a spying mission. She allowed herself to be captured and taken away with them. Subsequent to this she got married to the king of the Ugbo. Her new husband wanted pleasures from her but she wouldn't give in because she was married previously and was on a mission. She told him to tell her the secret of the marauders, he didn't want to but after a great deal of prodding, he gave in. He told her that the only thing they fear was FIRE, if they saw fire they would run. After this information she concocted an escape plan. She asked for some oranges and made the juice have a sleeping effect on the palace people. When they woke up after eating them, they found that she had gone to tell her people. They were soon prepared for the marauders.|$|E
500|$|For much of {{the length}} of the eastern coast of Madagascar {{bordering}} the Indian Ocean, architecture is highly uniform: nearly all traditional homes in this region are built on low stilts and are roofed with thatch made of the fronds of the traveler's palm (ravinala madagascariensis). [...] The stilts, floor and walls are commonly made of the trunk of this same plant, typically after pounding it flat to make wide planks (for floors and roofing) or narrow strips (for walls). These strips are affixed vertically to the frame; the <b>raffia</b> plant is often used in the same way, in place of the traveler's palm, in the north. When bamboo is used in place of ravinala, the long pounded sheets are often woven together to create walls with a checker-like pattern.|$|E
500|$|Dwellings made {{of plant}} {{material}} {{are common in}} the coastal regions and were once commonly used throughout the Highlands as well. The types of plants available in a given locality determine the building material and style of construction. [...] The vast majority of homes made of plant material are rectangular, low (one-story) houses with a peaked roof and are often built on low stilts. [...] These architectural features are nearly identical {{to those found in}} parts of Indonesia. Materials used for construction include reeds (near rivers), rushes (in the southwest around Toliara), endemic succulents (as fencing in the south), wood (in the south and among the Zafimaniry, and formerly common in the Highlands), bamboo (especially in the eastern rain forests), papyrus (formerly in the Highlands around Lake Alaotra), grasses (ubiquitous), palms (ubiquitous but prevalent in the west around Mahajanga) and <b>raffia</b> (especially in the north and northeast).|$|E
500|$|On {{the eastern}} side of Madagascar, there is {{virtually}} no zone of transition between the earthen houses of the Highlands and the dwellings made of plant materials common to the coastal regions. [...] In the vast and sparsely populated expanses between the Highlands and the western coastal areas, however, inhabitants utilize locally available materials to construct dwellings that bear features of both regions. [...] Most often houses are small – one room and only one story high – constructed of a skeleton of horizontally arranged sticks affixed to the wooden house frame as pictured in the preceding section on wooden construction. [...] But unlike coastal homes where this stick skeleton would serve as a base for affixing plant material to form walls, earthen cob may be packed into the framework instead. [...] The roof is thatched to complete the dwelling. [...] These intermediary houses are also often distinguished by the presence of shortened Highlands-style wooden columns on the western face to support the elongated eave of the peaked roof, much as they support the verandas of the larger homes of Imerina. [...] The floor is typically packed dirt and may be covered with woven mats of grasses or <b>raffia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|When King Garcia II gave up {{the island}} of Luanda and its royal {{fisheries}} to the Portuguese in 1651, he switched the kingdom's currency to <b>raffia</b> cloth. The cloth was [...] "napkin-sized" [...] and called mpusu. In the 17th century, 100 mpusu could buy one slave implying a value {{greater than that of}} the nzimbu currency.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of the first {{recorded}} contact with the Europeans, the Kingdom of Kongo was a highly developed state at the center of an extensive trading network. Apart from natural resources and ivory, the country manufactured and traded copperware, ferrous metal goods, <b>raffia</b> cloth, and pottery. The Kongo people spoke in the Kikongo language. The eastern regions, especially that part known as the Seven Kingdoms of Kongo dia Nlaza (or in Kikongo Mumbwadi or [...] "the Seven"), were particularly famous for the production of cloth.|$|E
2500|$|Nor is {{this form}} entirely {{new in the}} history of the plastic arts. The negroes of the Ivory Coast have made use of a very similar method of {{expression}} in their dance masks. These are constructed as follows: a completely flat plane forms the lower part of the face; to this is joined the high forehead, which is sometimes equally flat, sometimes bent slightly backward. While the nose is added as a simple strip of wood, two cylinders protrude about eight centimeters to form the eyes, and one slightly shorter hexahedron forms the mouth. The frontal surfaces of the cylinder and hexahedron are painted, and the hair is represented by <b>raffia.</b> It is true that the form is still closed here; however, it is not the [...] "real" [...] form, but rather a tight formal scheme of plastic primeval force. Here, too, we find a scheme of forms and [...] "real details" [...] (the painted eyes, mouth and hair) as stimuli. The result in the mind of the spectator, the desired effect, is a human face." ...|$|E
2500|$|The spun fibers are {{generally}} divided into animal fibers, plant and synthetic fibers. [...] These fiber types are chemically different, corresponding to proteins, carbohydrates and synthetic polymers, respectively. [...] Animal fibers include silk, but generally are long hairs of {{animals such as}} sheep (wool), goat (angora, or cashmere goat), rabbit (angora), llama, alpaca, dog, cat, camel, yak, and muskox (qiviut). [...] Plants used for fibers include cotton, flax (for linen), bamboo, ramie, hemp, jute, nettle, <b>raffia,</b> yucca, coconut husk, banana fiber, soy and corn. [...] Rayon and acetate fibers are also produced from cellulose mainly derived from trees. [...] Common synthetic fibers include acrylics, polyesters such as dacron and ingeo, nylon and other polyamides, and olefins such as polypropylene. [...] Of these types, wool is generally favored for knitting, chiefly owing to its superior elasticity, warmth and (sometimes) felting; however, wool is generally less convenient to clean {{and some people are}} allergic to it. [...] It is also common to blend different fibers in the yarn, e.g., 85% alpaca and 15% silk. [...] Even within a type of fiber, there can be great variety in the length and thickness of the fibers; for example, Merino wool and Egyptian cotton are favored because they produce exceptionally long, thin (fine) fibers for their type.|$|E
5000|$|Polypropylene <b>raffia,</b> or PP <b>raffia</b> is a {{packaging}} material made from weaving ribbons of polypropylene. It {{is named after}} the <b>raffia</b> palm, which the packaging emulates to some extent. Polypropylene <b>raffia</b> {{is considered to be}} a [...] "widely used material for atmospheric capture".|$|E
5000|$|Alabere: Stitching <b>raffia</b> {{onto the}} fabric {{in a pattern}} prior to dyeing. The <b>raffia</b> palm is stripped, and the spine sewn into the fabric. After dyeing the <b>raffia</b> is usually ripped out, {{although}} some choose to leave it in and let {{wear and tear on}} the garment slowly reveal the design.|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} Njyem {{house is}} a rectangular structure made of leaves folded over a <b>raffia</b> branch and pinned in place with a small twig. Alternatively, strips of bark {{could be used for}} the sides. The A-shaped roof is covered in <b>raffia</b> palm leaves. Present-day houses are made of vertical poles with <b>raffia</b> strips lashed horizontally inside and out. Mud is packed between the poles and held in place by the <b>raffia</b> strips. The roofs continue to consist of thatches made of <b>raffia</b> palm leaves, although aluminium roofing is also being used when finances permit. Wealthier Njyem and those living in larger villages and towns often live in houses employing mud-blocks or concrete-blocks.|$|E
50|$|In Central Africa, the Kuba people {{developed}} <b>raffia</b> cloth {{from the}} <b>raffia</b> plant fibers. It was {{widely used in}} the region. Barkcloth was also extensively used.|$|E
