5|$|You Don't Know Jack was {{developed}} by Chicago-based company Jellyvision. The You Don't Know Jack (YDKJ) series, though popular in the 1990s during the rise of gaming on personal computers, had not had an official full release since 1998 with You Don't Know Jack: The Ride. Though Jellyvision offered some web-based You Don't Know Jack games in the interim years, the developers left the gaming market after seeing the rise of home gaming consoles in the early 2000s. Though they had considered adapting the game for consoles, and had produced two titles for the original PlayStation, they could only <b>realize</b> <b>You</b> Don't Know Jack games with players at the same keyboard for input. During this time, Jellyvision reinvented itself as Jellyvision Labs, offering its services in business-to-business communication including for tax software from H Block and interviews for Equifax.|$|E

[...] Araya replied, [...] "No.People {{thought we were}} serious!...back then you had that PMRC, who literally took everything to heart, when in actuality you're trying to create an image.

500|$|The {{gameplay}} generally received {{praise from}} reviewers, with some caveats. While IGN's Steve Butts [...] "loved" [...] the game's new units and operations, he complained of a predictability in the missions, {{asking for more}} surprises. GameSpot's Jason Ocampo agreed, noting that the [...] "campaigns feature familiar plot twists", while praising the [...] "new twists" [...] on the Age of Empires series-style gameplay. GameSpy noted {{that some of the}} changes were well overdue. However, the gameplay was given a big ticket, with the hypothetical question posed; [...] "Ever play an expansion or sequel and then <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> can never go back to its predecessor because you've been spoiled by the new?" ...|$|E

500|$|Louis Leterrier, {{who enjoyed}} the TV series {{as a child}} and liked the first film, had {{expressed}} interest in directing the Iron Man film adaptation. Jon Favreau had taken that project, so Marvel offered him the Hulk. Leterrier was reluctant as he was unsure if he could replicate Lee's style, but Marvel explained that was not their intent. Leterrier's primary inspiration was Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale's Hulk: Gray (a retelling of the character's first appearance). He replicated every comic book panel that he pinned-up during pre-production, from the many comics he browsed, in the final film. Leterrier said that he planned to show Bruce Banner's struggle with the monster within him, while Feige added the film would explore [...] "that element of wish fulfillment, of overcoming an injustice or a bully and tapping into a strength that you didn't quite <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> had in yourself". Arad also said the film would be [...] "a lot more of a love story between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross".|$|E

According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E

2500|$|At age nine, {{while taking}} folk and {{classical}} guitar lessons from Tiny Moore, Miller was writing [...] "little albums' worth" [...] of derivative songs, and started his first band, innocently calling it [...] "The Monkees." [...] He later noted, [...] "We were really little kids, and we didn't <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> {{had to have}} your own personality... I was Mike Nesmith, of course," [...] naming the serious Monkee known as a songwriter. By 1971, Miller's lessons switched to rock guitar, and he [...] "had pretty serious bands from seventh grade on." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I want {{to explain}} what happened. Sunday night when you {{requested}} to have someone over I didn't <b>realize</b> <b>you</b> wanted the room in private. I went to Molly's room and I was showing her how I set up my computer so I can access it from anywhere. I turned on my camera and saw you {{in the corner of}} the screen and I immediately closed it. I felt uncomfortable and guilty of what happened. Obviously I told people what occurred so they could give me advice. Then Tuesday when you requested the room again I wanted to make sure what happened Sunday wouldn't happen again and not to video chat me from 930 to 12. Just in case, I turned my camera away and put my computer to sleep so even if anyone tried it wouldn't work. I wanted to make amends for Sunday night. I'm sorry if you heard something distorted and disturbing but I assure you all my actions were good natured." ...|$|E
