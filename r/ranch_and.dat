5|$|Further downstream, {{the creek}} passes through Fair Oaks <b>Ranch</b> <b>and</b> Bulverde. The steady flow begins to {{dissipate}} {{in certain areas}} as it approaches Camp Bullis in northern San Antonio, leaving dry patches that reveal a rocky bottom.

5|$|As of 2004, the Aliso Creek {{watershed}} had {{a population}} of 149,087. Nine communities were established in the creek's watershed as it {{was developed in the}} 20th century. By 2001 seven of them had become cities (from mouth to source, Laguna Beach, Laguna Niguel, Aliso Viejo, Laguna Hills, Laguna Woods, Lake Forest, and Mission Viejo), and the last two, Foothill <b>Ranch</b> <b>and</b> Portola Hills, were incorporated into the city of Lake Forest in 2000. The largest urban area in the basin is in the middle, where Interstate 5 bisects the watershed east to west. The northern boundary of this urban area stretches a little beyond California State Route 241 and the southern boundary is near California State Route 73 in the south. This area consists primarily of Lake Forest, Laguna Woods, and Laguna Hills.|$|E
5|$|At {{the ranch}} {{inhabited}} by the Proletheans, a religious extremist group, following her impregnation, Helena is {{introduced to the}} group's nursery where she bonds with a young girl. The Prolethean leader, Henrik Johanssen (Peter Outerbridge), impregnates his teenage daughter Gracie (Zoé de Grand'Maison) with his and Helena's embryos. Sharing their displeasure with what Henrik has done, Helena and Gracie decide to flee the ranch together, but are caught by Henrik as they are preparing to leave. Henrik's protégé and Gracie's lover, Mark (Ari Millen), arrives to defend Gracie. Mark and Gracie flee together as Helena attacks Henrik. Helena tortures Henrik with his own medical instruments before burning down the <b>ranch</b> <b>and</b> running away herself.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant <b>Ranch</b> <b>and</b> the visitor's center include rufous hummingbirds, Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches.

5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} <b>ranch</b> <b>and</b> any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop being so hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E
5|$|In 1947, Marguerite Henry {{released}} the children's book Misty of Chincoteague, {{the first in}} a series of novels that made the Chincoteague breed internationally famous. The real Misty was foaled on Chincoteague Island in 1946, and was purchased as a weanling by Henry. In 1961, the publicity was increased even more when the film Misty was made, based on the book. The publicity generated by the books assisted the Chincoteague Fire Department and the breed in remaining viable into the 21st century. While fictionalized, the books were based on a real horse and ranch on Chincoteague Island, and the Misty of Chincoteague Foundation was established in 1990, to preserve the Beebe <b>Ranch</b> <b>and</b> establish a museum with memorabilia from the series. Model horse company Breyer Animal Creations has created models of Misty and five of her descendants. As of 2001, there were around 40 surviving descendants of Misty worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{back at the}} ranch, Mephesto and his {{assistant}} Kevin have created a human clone of Stan for Terrance.

The cloned Stan breaks free from Mephesto's <b>ranch</b> <b>and</b> proceeds to terrorize the town. The boys eventually find the clone and take it to Stan's house and convince it to attack Shelley; however, it decides to destroy the house and indirectly kills Kenny, by flinging him into a microwave, with a chair.

But Tskany says that the lion is still in its cage.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{recruited}} McMillan to {{join the}} Manhattan Project, the wartime effort to create atomic bombs, in September 1942. Initially, he commuted {{back and forth between}} San Diego, where his family was, and Berkeley. In November he accompanied Oppenheimer on a trip to New Mexico on which the Los Alamos Ranch School was selected as the site of the project's weapons research laboratory, which became the Los Alamos Laboratory. With Oppenheimer and John H. Manley, he drew up the specifications for the new laboratory's technical buildings. He recruited personnel for the laboratory, including Richard Feynman and Robert R. Wilson, established the test area known as the Anchor <b>Ranch,</b> <b>and</b> scoured the country for technical equipment from machine tools to a cyclotron.|$|E

5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} April 2, 1987 and ended that following October. Interior footage {{took place at}} Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire, England, while location shooting took place in Wales and New Zealand. Lucas initially visualized shooting the film similar to Return of the Jedi, with studio scenes at Elstree and locations in Northern California, but the idea eventually faded. However, some exteriors were done around Skywalker <b>Ranch</b> <b>and</b> on location at Burney Falls, near Mount Shasta. The Chinese government refused Lucas the chance for a brief location shoot. He then sent a group of photographers to South China to photograph specific scenery, which was then used for background blue screen footage. Tongariro National Park in New Zealand was chosen to house Bavmorda's castle.|$|E
5|$|Ramona, {{published}} in 1884, {{was based in}} part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours on the <b>ranch</b> <b>and</b> did not meet Ysabel del Valle, but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended. In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth, and Ramona sews it back together. The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California.|$|E
5|$|The new Republic of Texas grew rapidly. The {{shores of}} the bay were {{initially}} home to farms and ranches. Longhorn cattle, which had roamed wild throughout Texas, became free resources for producing hides and beef shipped throughout North America. The famed Allen Ranch was established near Harrisburg {{in what is now}} southeast Houston and Pasadena, in addition to the Bay Lake <b>Ranch</b> <b>and</b> other ranches established around the bay. The range land of these ranches came to encompass most of the terrain around the bay south of the San Jacinto River. Cedar Bayou (part of modern Baytown), Shoal Point (part of modern Texas City), and other small communities began to develop during this period. Eagle Point (part of modern San Leon) became an important shipping and trading post for slaves.|$|E
