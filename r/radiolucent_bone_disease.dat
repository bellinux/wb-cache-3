40|$|Parathyroid hyperplasia, oversecretion of {{parathyroid}} hormone (PTH), and hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> are characteristic features of chronic uremia; they develop {{early in the}} course of uremia and often in a progressive way. This review focuses on the potential for arrest or regression of hyperparathyroid-induced <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> For this purpose, the review addresses investigations that have used bone histology and not investigations that indirectly attempted to demonstrate changes in the skeleton by measurements of bone mineral density or laboratory indices of bone turnover, other than PTH. A prerequisite for inducing regression of the hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> is a significant suppression of PTH secretion or reversal of hyperparathyroidism and uremia. It is concluded, on the basis of paired bone biopsy studies in patients with established hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> that <b>bone</b> histology can be improved or normalized after treatment that diminishes PTH levels. Oversuppression of PTH levels, however, might lead to adynamic <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> Clin J Am Soc Nephrol 1 : 367 – 373, 2006. doi: 10. 2215 /CJN. 01961205 Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is a disabling skeletal disease in uremic patients that consists of a high-turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> a low-turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> or a mixture of both.

40|$|AbstractThe {{clinical}} {{distinction of}} different types of renal <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> is not easy and plasma intact parathyroid hormone remains the most widely used noninvasive test to predict bone histology. We studied the bone biopsy histology of 15 chronic hemodialysis patients and evaluated the usefulness of plasma intact parathyroid hormone in predicting the types of renal <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> The plasma intact parathyroid hormone of high turnover hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> in hemodialysis patients was 316. 3 ± 162. 8 ng/L and that of non-high-turnover was 144. 1 ± 108. 9 ng/L (p= 0. 034). The plasma intact parathyroid hormone of low turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> in hemodialysis patients was 127. 0 ± 105. 7 ng/L and that of non-low-turnover was 290. 4 ± 161. 1 ng/L (p= 0. 033). The thresholds of plasma intact parathyroid hormone for distinguishing osteodystrophy and sensitivity, specificity of plasma intact parathyroid hormone were analyzed by using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under receiver operating characteristic of plasma intact parathyroid hormone in diagnosing of hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> and low turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> was 0. 84 and 0. 82, respectively. The optimal cutoff value of plasma intact parathyroid hormone for diagnosis of hyperparathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> was 250 ng/L (sensitivity, 75 %; specificity, 71. 4 %), and that of low turnover <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> was 100 ng/L (sensitivity, 60 %; specificity, 90 %).

40|$|Abstract. That <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> accompanies {{renal failure}} {{has been known}} for over 100 years. This <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> (renal osteodystrophy) has been {{variously}} attributed to hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, alumi-nium toxicity, iron toxicity, uraemia, {{and a host of other}} aetiologies. In addition, the form the <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> takes has been variously described as osteitis fibrosa, osteomalacia, mixed uraemic osteodystrophy and the aplastic (adynamic) lesion.

40|$|There is {{increasing}} {{evidence to suggest}} that the Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of myeloma <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> In the present study, we determined whether increasing Wnt signaling within the bone marrow microenvironment in myeloma counteracts development of osteolytic <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> C 57 BL/KaLwRij mice were inoculated intravenously with murine 5 TGM 1 myeloma cells, resulting in tumor growth in bone and development of myeloma <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> Lithium chloride (LiCl) treatment activated Wnt signaling in osteoblasts, inhibited myeloma <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> and decreased tumor burden in bone, but increased tumor growth when 5 TGM 1 cells were inoculated subcutaneously. Abrogation of beta-catenin activity and disruption of Wnt signaling in 5 TGM 1 cells by stable overexpression of a dominant-negative TCF 4 prevented the LiCl-induced increase in subcutaneous growth but had no effect on LiCl-induced reduction in tumor burden within bone or on osteolysis in myeloma-bearing mice. Together, these data highlight the importance of the local microenvironment in the effect of Wnt signaling on the development of myeloma <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> and demonstrate that, despite a direct effect to increase tumor growth at extraosseous sites, increasing Wnt signaling in the bone marrow microenvironment can prevent the development of myeloma <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> and inhibit myeloma growth within bone in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Bone is {{commonly}} affected in cancer. Cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> {{results from the}} primary disease, or from therapies against the primary condition, causing bone fragility. Bone-modifying agents, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, are efficacious in preventing and delaying cancer-related <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> With evidence-based care pathways, guidelines assist physicians in clinical decision-making. Of the 57 million deaths in 2008 worldwide, almost two thirds were due to non-communicable diseases, led by cardiovascular <b>diseases</b> and cancers. <b>Bone</b> is a commonly affected organ in cancer, and although the incidence of metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> is not well defined, {{it is estimated that}} around half of patients who die from cancer in the USA each year have bone involvement. Furthermore, cancer-induced <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> can result from the primary disease itself, either due to circulating bone resorbing substances or metastatic <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> such as commonly occurs with breast, lung and prostate cancer, or from therapies administered to treat the primary condition thus causing bone loss and fractures.

Tumour skeletal-related events include pathologic fractures, spinal cord compression, surgery and radiotherapy to bone and may or may not include hypercalcaemia of malignancy while skeletal complication refers to pain and other symptoms. Some evidence demonstrates the efficacy of various interventions including bone-modifying agents, such as bisphosphonates and denosumab, in preventing or delaying cancer-related <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> The latter includes treatment of patients with metastatic skeletal lesions in general, adjuvant treatment of breast and prostate cancer in particular, and the prevention of cancer-associated <b>bone</b> <b>disease.</b> This has {{led to the development of}} guidelines by several societies and working groups to assist physicians in clinical decision making, providing them with evidence-based care pathways to prevent skeletal-related events and bone loss.

40|$|Parathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> {{in humans}} {{is caused by}} chronic {{hyperparathyroidism}} (HPT). Continuous infusion of PTH into rats results in histological changes similar to parathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease,</b> including increased <b>bone</b> formation, focal bone resorption, and severe peritrabecular fibrosis, whereas pulsatile PTH increases bone formation without skeletal abnormalities. Using a cDNA microarray with over 5000 genes, we identified an association between increased platelet-derived growth factor-A (PDGF-A) signaling and PTH-induced <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> in rats. Verification of PDGF-A overexpression was accomplished with a ribonuclease protection assay. Using immunohistochemistry, PDGF-A peptide was localized to mast cells in PTH-treated rats. We also report a novel strategy for prevention of parathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease</b> using triazolopyrimidine (trapidil). Trapidil, an inhibitor of PDGF signaling, {{did not have any}} effect on indexes of bone turnover in normal rats. However, dramatic reductions in marrow fibrosis and bone resorption, but not bone formation, were observed in PTH-treated rats given trapidil. Also, trapidil antagonized the PTH-induced increases in mRNA levels for PDGF-A. These results suggest that PDGF signaling is important for the detrimental skeletal effects of HPT, and drugs that target the cytokine or its receptor might be useful in reducing or preventing parathyroid <b>bone</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R
