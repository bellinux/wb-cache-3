40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{investigated}} {{the interactive effects of}} insulin and carbohydrate on glycogen replenishment in different rat hindlimb muscles. Forty male Sprague Dawley rats were assigned to 5 groups, including 1) sedentary control with carbohydrate supplement (2 g glucose[*]·[*]kg body wt- 1), 2) sedentary rats with 16 hours recovery, carbohydrate and insulin (0. 5 U[*]·[*]kg body wt- 1), 3) swimming without recovery, 4) swimming with 16 hours recovery and carbohydrate supplement, and 5) swimming with 16 hours recovery, carbohydrate and insulin. The swimming protocol consisted of two 3 h swimming sections, which were separated by a 45 min rest. The insulin and carbohydrate were administered to the rats immediately after exercise. At the end of the experiment, the soleus (S), plantaris (P), quadriceps (Q) and gastrocnemius (G) were surgically excised to evaluate glycogen utilization and replenishment. We observed that glycogen utilization was significantly lower in G and Q than S and P during swimming (p < 0. 05), and S showed the greatest capacity of glycogen resynthesis after post-exercise recovery (p < 0. 05). In the sedentary state, the glycogen synthesis did not differ among hindlimb muscles during insulin and carbohydrate treatments. Interestingly, with insulin and carbohydrate, the glycogen resynthesis in S and P were significantly greater than in Q and G following post-exercise recovery (p < 0. 05). We therefore concluded that the soleus and plantaris are the primary working muscles during swimming, and the greatest glycogen <b>replenishment</b> <b>capacity</b> of the soleus during post-exercise recovery is likely due to its highest insulin sensitivity...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{spatial distribution of}} adult and juvenile coral assemblages in the southwestern lagoon of New Caledonia, from disturbed fringing reefs within bays, to oceanic barrier reefs. Generic richness, abundance, and percent cover were highly variable at this scale, but no clear cross-shelf gradient was found. Rather, community composition was more related to reef biotopes. Correlations and canonical correspondence analyses revealed that composition and abundance of coral assemblages were related to substrate types (cover of turf algae and cover of encrusting coralline algae), but not to water quality or metal concentrations in sediments. We found a strong relationship between juvenile and adult distribution for all dominant genera, which suggests that recruitment processes are also a major factor structuring these populations. The densities of juveniles and their proportion in the coral assemblages were relatively low, which implies that <b>replenishment</b> <b>capacities</b> and potential for recovery are probably limited for these reefs...|$|R

40|$|Chenery, Manne, and Srinivasan {{contributed to}} a model of {{investment}} in capacity expansion assuming a demand growth rate, a discount rate, and economies of scale. In their model, minimizing the sum of discounted future capacity investment costs always requires <b>capacity</b> <b>replenishments</b> to be equally spaced in time if summation is over an infinite time horizon. But the model assumes a static technology, no depreciation, and no effect of price on demand. ...|$|R
40|$|The zonal {{distribution}} of GSH metabolism was investigated by comparing hepatocytes {{obtained from the}} periportal (zone 1) or perivenous (zone 3) region by digitonin/collagenase perfusion. Freshly isolated periportal and perivenous cells had similar viability (dye exclusion, lactate dehydrogenase leakage and ATP content) and GSH content (2. 4 and 2. 7 mumol/g respectively). During incubation, periportal cells slowly accumulated GSH (0. 35 mumol/h per g), whereas in perivenous cells a decrease occurred (- 0. 14 mumol/h per g). Also, {{in the presence of}} either L-methionine or L-cysteine (0. 5 mM) periportal hepatocytes accumulated GSH much faster (3. 5 mumol/h per g) than did perivenous cells (1. 9 mumol/h per g). These periportal-perivenous differences were also found in cells from fasted rats. Efflux of GSH was faster from perivenous cells than from periportal cells, but this difference only explained 10 - 20 % of the periportal-perivenous difference in accumulation. Furthermore, periportal cells accumulated GSH to a plateau 26 - 40 % higher than in perivenous cells. There {{was no significant difference in}} gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase or glutathione synthetase activity between the periportal and perivenous cell preparations. The periportal-perivenous difference in GSH accumulation was unaffected by inhibition of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase or by 5 mM-glutamate or -glutamine, but was slightly diminished by 2 mM-L-methionine. This suggests differences between periportal and perivenous cells in their metabolism and/or transport of (sulphur) amino acids. Our results suggest that a lower GSH <b>replenishment</b> <b>capacity</b> of the hepatocytes from the perivenous region may contribute to the greater vulnerability of this region to xenobiotic damage...|$|E
30|$|A {{groundwater}} resources assessment {{has been}} carried out for the Lake Nyasa Basin east Africa, with reference to sub catchments further to the whole basin wise analysis, including quantification of potential yields from the aquifers. Numerical groundwater models, MODFLOW-SURFACT coupled with Visual MODFLOW, were used to assess sub-basin groundwater sustainability (Via “Zone Budget” software package). The model has been calibrated to observed hydraulic head and processed baseflow estimate. It is concluded that the aquifer system is sustained by episodic recharge and the long-term gaining storage which represents the maximum extractable volume. Future predictions of groundwater usage indicate that by 2035 the percentage of annual safe yield extracted will increase to between 11.3 and 103 %. Model result suggests {{that there is a need}} to revise the current estimate of sustainable yield based on future climate change conditions and projected population growth, which would decrease spring flows substantially and decrease hydraulic head basin-wide. It also suggests that by 2035 some sub catchments will be nearly at or exceeding the annual safe yield leaving no room for socio-economic development, or the need to reduce existing socio-economic demands to meet domestic demands. Besides to improving the natural <b>replenishment</b> <b>capacity</b> through artificial recharge technique, the other option is to increase the percentage of total recharge allocated to the annual safe yield from 10 % of the total annual recharge to 20 % in these catchments. This provides a basis for management of individual groundwater scheme in sustaining livelihood activities or implications of policies and to develop a plan for potential groundwater extraction scenarios pertaining to water use and allocation.|$|E
40|$|Processes {{occurring}} {{early in}} the life stages of corals can greatly influence the demography of coral populations, and successful settlement of coral larvae that leads to recruitment is a critical life history stage for coral reef ecosystems. Although corals in Singapore persist in one the world's most anthropogenically impacted reef systems, {{our understanding of the}} role of coral settlement in the persistence of coral communities in Singapore remains limited. Spatial and temporal patterns of coral settlement were examined at 7 sites in the southern islands of Singapore, using settlement tiles deployed and collected every 3 months from 2011 to 2013. Settlement occurred year round, but varied significantly across time and space. Annual coral settlement was low (~ 54. 72 spat m(- 2) yr(- 1)) relative to other equatorial regions, but there was evidence of temporal variation in settlement rates. Peak settlement occurred between March-May and September-November, coinciding with annual coral spawning periods (March-April and October), while the lowest settlement occurred from December-February during the northeast monsoon. A period of high settlement was also observed between June and August in the first year (2011 / 12), possibly due to some species spawning outside predicted spawning periods, larvae settling from other locations or extended larval settlement competency periods. Settlement rates varied significantly among sites, but spatial variation was relatively consistent between years, suggesting the strong effects of local coral assemblages or environmental conditions. Pocilloporidae were the most abundant coral spat (83. 6 %), while Poritidae comprised only 6 % of the spat, and Acroporidae < 1 %. Other, unidentifiable families represented 10 % of the coral spat. These results indicate that current settlement patterns are reinforcing the local adult assemblage structure ('others'; i. e. sediment-tolerant coral taxa) in Singapore, but that the <b>replenishment</b> <b>capacity</b> of Singapore's reefs appears relatively constrained, which could lead to less resilient reefs...|$|E
40|$|The UK DNA Banking Network (UDBN) is a {{secondary}} biobank: it aggregates and manages resources (samples and data) originated by others. The network comprises, {{on the one}} hand, investigator groups led by clinicians each with a distinct disease specialism and, on the other hand, a research infrastructure to manage samples and data. The infrastructure addresses the problem of providing secure quality-assured accrual, storage, <b>replenishment</b> and distribution <b>capacities</b> for samples and of facilitating access to DNA aliquots and data for new peer-reviewed studies in genetic epidemiology. ‘Fair access’ principles and practices have been pragmatically developed that, unlike open access policies in this area, are not cumbersome but, rather, are fit {{for the purpose of}} expediting new study designs and their implementation. UDBN has so far distributed > 60, 000 samples for major genotyping studies yielding > 10  billion genotypes. It provides a working model that can inform progress in biobanking nationally, across Europe and internationally...|$|R
40|$|Inventory {{management}} {{is a complex}} aspect of Supply Chain Management that is frequently discussed and debated {{due to the fact}} that it has a high impact on customer satisfaction as well as financial performance. This thesis addresses how an inventory management policy was developed and established in a vaccines company where customer service is the top priority and product quantities are high. The work in this thesis is from a six month internship at Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics in Marburg, Germany. Project work focused on three inventory management questions: What are the right inventory targets for each product? What is the process to manage, monitor and maintain the inventory targets? How should the inventory targets be measured and controlled? The results from this project show that an effective way to set inventory targets is through the combination of analytical inventory calculations and the strategic analysis of the business environment. A detailed inventory model was built in Microsoft Excel that uses common inventory formulas and considers critical product attributes such as shelf-life, process lead times, batch sizing, <b>replenishment</b> frequency and <b>capacity</b> constraints to calculate the inventory targets. The model results are part of the larger inventory management policy that was created and incorporated into the Supply Chain group's Sales & Operations Planning process. The complete inventory management policy addresses the details of regularly setting inventory targets, how they should be maintained and tracked and defines clear roles and responsibilities. by Johanna Christine Wonsowicz.
