After the visit, all patients were interviewed, and patients who had given written consent completed a questionnaire. SETTING: The family practice unit at a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of new and returning patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient consent to observation or videotaping. RESULTS: Most patients (92. 2 %) agreed to be observed. Of those asked only <b>for</b> <b>consent</b> to observe, 97. 3 % agreed. Of those asked <b>for</b> <b>consent</b> to observe and videotape, 85. 2 % agreed. When specifically asked, 22 % of patients who agreed to observation expressed concerns. CONCLUSION: We must devise clear policies and procedures <b>for</b> obtaining patient <b>consent</b> that are both sensitive to patients' concerns and administratively effective...|$|R
