There exists a trend change in DN(k) of each empirical dataset: the head part has a clear increasing trend, but the tail part does not (Fig.  4). It means that degree assortativity are mainly contributed by small degree authors.|$|R

30|$|The above {{mentioned}} {{results of this}} study indicate that government support is significantly related to the AEI is another key element for fostering the Academic Entrepreneurial Intentions of young <b>researchers</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> consistent with the findings of (Fini et al., 2017, Audretsch, Grilo, and Thurik 2007). These results <b>are</b> <b>providing</b> supporting signals to the Government of Pakistan’s initiatives for encouraging the young researchers for funding new research programs and supporting the incubators within universities. Government of Pakistan through Higher Education Commission (HEC) has also enhanced a number of research programs, technology park funding, research grants, and ORIC and establishing incubation center at universities. This helps in determining young researchers’ attitude and belief in government policies and motivates them towards spin-off the new venture from their research.|$|R

50|$|The {{proposed}} {{sequence of}} leading activities is not strictly determined by biological age, {{but rather by}} the typical age-related forms of adult and peer interaction in a given society (Chaiklin 2003: 48). As {{a result of their}} historical and cultural specificity, leading activities are subject to change. Different leading activities may develop and be found more beneficial for development within particular societies, leading to a revision or reconceptualization of the most effective leading activities. Karpov (2005) reviews recent empirical findings of Western <b>researchers,</b> <b>which</b> <b>are</b> highly consistent with the neo-Vygotskian analysis of child development through engagement in leading activities.|$|R

30|$|Graham (1987) {{reviewed}} 19 early predictive validity {{studies and}} attempted to analyze the relationship between various English proficiency test scores (mostly TOEFL) and academic success.

The results of prediction studies conducted after Graham (1987) remain inconsistent. A number of them found significant correlations between TOEFL scores and GPAs (e.g., Johnson, 1988; Light & Teh-Yuan, 1991; Stoynoff, 1997; Wait & Gressel, 2009), while others concluded that TOEFL {{was not a significant}} predictor of academic success (e.g., Ayers & Quattlebaum, 1992; Krausz et al., 2005; Nelson et al., 2004).|$|R
