Trommels come in many designs such as concentric screens, series or parallel arrangement and each component has a few configurations.

50|$|The Iron Plant Complex has 10 main {{production}} line units (the rest are auxiliary and back up units). Iron ores with large grains from Golgohar are converted by ball mills in the Pelletizing plant. After mixing with Chadermalou's smaller grains and bentonite in blending machines it is changed to pellets (diameter: 6-25 mm) and screened by a two-story <b>roller</b> <b>screen.</b> Pellets solidify in an induration tunnel or furnace at 1280 °C. The Lime Production Plant receives limestone from the Hozmahi mine, {{which is then}} calcinated in two rotary kilns at 780-1050 °C. After screening, calcinated lime {{may be used in}} the Lime Plant, consumed in the Palletizing Plant, Briquet Unit or for industrial water production. At the Direct Reduction plant, pellets are charged in Midrex shaft furnaces after misco-grain screening (less than 5mm). Two reducing gases (derived from cracking natural gas or methane, consisting of Co and H2) are injected into the furnace, combine with oxygen from the pellets resulting in CO2 + H2O. Without oxygen, pellets become sponge irons. After screening, sponge irons are transferred to the Steel Plant. Sponge irons with a diameter less than 5 mm go to the briquet unit to produce briquets (diameter above 25 mm). Then, they are transferred to the Steel Plant with the sponge iron.|$|E

An outlet with two design variables is investigated and the optimal shape for the given system and production flow is found by exploring the design space with 2000 simulations.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} energy and light {{performance}} assessment of two configurations of an Active Transparent Façade (ATF), which are investigated {{by means of}} an experimental campaign that makes use of a full-scale mock-up room of an office building. The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or double pane glazing with low-e coating), while share all the other features - i. e. external glazing, shading system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated double pane glazing (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively. A higher amount of daylight is then guaranteed within the indoor space by Module A, but this might result in a higher probability of visual discomfort for the occupants. On the other hand, the Module B determines lower daily energy transmitted toward the indoor environment than Module A: on average, the daily energy gain/loss from/toward the outdoor environment are reduced of about 30 %, in summer (with or without the reflective <b>roller</b> <b>screen),</b> and in the range 30 - 40 % in winter (with or without the reflective <b>roller</b> <b>screen...</b>|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Fresh {{municipal}} solid wastes (MSW) and aged MSW including MSW from landfills and dumpsite have been characterized and compared by their components, moisture content and lower heat value (LHV) {{in order to}} recycle and dispose them properly. Firstly the characterizing experiments were performed and {{the results showed that}} generally the fresh MSW are of high moisture contents and their LHV is below 6500 kJ/kg; and when 40 % of plastics were separated, their LHV is less than 5000 kJ/kg. Combustibles in aged MSW were easily to be separated and their LHV is higher than 11000 kJ/kg as just separated. Analysis of aged MSW of different years ’ old showed that as MSW became older the moisture and paper contents decreased. No leachate produced from aged MSW during the analysis and separation process. For both fresh MSW and aged MSW the main contributor to LHV is plastics. Secondly a simple separating system consisting of a <b>roller</b> <b>screen</b> and a winnower is used to separate plastics from fresh MSW and aged MSW, and the quality of plastics were compared by their physical parameters after made into pellets; the results showed that plastics from fresh MSW can be recycled as raw material for secondary product; while plastics separated from aged MSW are of lower quality and only suitable to be recycled as fuel material. Finally different recycling methods were suggested for fresh and aged MSWs based on their characteristics. 1...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{furnaces}} with roller hearth have wide {{application in}} the steel industry. Typically, furnaces with roller hearth belong to the class of medium-temperature heat treatment furnaces, but {{can be used to}} heat the billets for rolling. In this case, the furnaces belong to the class of high temperature heating furnaces, and their efficiency depends significantly on the reliability of the roller hearth furnace. In the high temperature heating furnaces are used three types of watercooled shaft rollers, namely rollers without insulation, <b>rollers</b> with insulating <b>screens</b> placed between the barrel and the shaft, and rollers with bulk insulation. The definition of the operating conditions of rollers with water-cooled shaft greatly facilitates the choice of their design parameters when designing. In this regard, at the design stage of the furnace with roller hearth, {{it is important to have}} information about the temperature distribution in the body of the rollers at various operating conditions. The article presents the research results of the temperature field of the hearth rollers of metallurgical heating furnaces. Modeling of stationary heat exchange between the oven atmosphere and a surface of rollers, and between the cooling water and shaft was executed by finite elements method. Temperature fields in the water-cooled shaft rollers of various designs are explored. The water-cooled shaft rollers without isolation, <b>rollers</b> with <b>screen</b> and <b>rollers</b> with bulk insulation, placed between the barrel and the water-cooled shaft were investigated. Determined the change of the thermo-physic parameters of the coolant, the temperature change of water when flowing in a pipe and shaft, as well as the desired pressure to supply water with a specified flow rate. Heat transfer coefficients between the cooling water and the shaft were determined directly during the solution based on the specified boundary conditions. Found that the greatest heat losses occur in the rollers without insulation. Insulation (screens or bulk insulation) between the shaft and the barrel of roller allows reducing the cooling water losses. A comparative analysis of research results allowed us to find that operating conditions of the furnace rolls with screen insulation are more favorable in terms of thermal conditions and losses, than those of rollers without the insulation and rollers with the bulk insulation...|$|R
40|$|Solar energy {{delivered}} by organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices {{has the potential}} to be a widely adopted source of sustainable electricity for a range of applications. Printing and coating technologies are being investigated as a means of quickly and cost effectively mass-producing OPV devices. This paper uses an analysis framework to review and assess the suitability of printing and coating technologies for delivering marketable OPV products. The analysis framework was developed by linking the OPV materials and fabrication method to the consumer requirements. The consumer requirements were {{delivered by}} the performance characteristics resulting from the device properties. These device properties were produced by the materials and fabrication method, including the printing/coating method. Specific criteria were developed for each of the stages and the interconnections were mapped to allow pathways between the fabrication technique and consumer requirements to be followed. The benefits and limitations of printing and coating processes were reviewed using the analysis framework for inkjet printing, <b>roller</b> printing, <b>screen</b> printing, pad printing, spin coating and spray coating, amongst others. Suitable processes were those that could meet the performance characteristics by the ability to produce nanoscale films, create set patterning and produce a variety of device sizes. The compatibility of the polymer physical properties with the printing/coating method was also important to achieve consistent products. The most suitable process for a particular application was dependent on the target device size and intended use. Identification of effective printing/coating techniques is necessary for rapid scale-up and commercially viable mass-manufacture of OPV products...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} energy {{conservation}} in buildings has spurred innovations in window technologies. These products include windows combined with shading devices, and windows featuring complex glazing such as switchable glazing, diffuse glazing, translucent and transparent insulation, patterned or decorative glass, etc. Current fenestration simulation tools for energy performance product ratings do not cover complex fenestration products. This paper addresses {{the development of}} detailed calculation models to compute the optical characteristics of complex fenestration products {{made up of a}} mixture of clear and scattering glazing layers. The models take into account not only the optical properties of the individual glazing layers making up the window product, but also the haze and gloss properties of the glazing layers. Specific optical models are developed to compute the optics of a clear substrate with applied or laminated scattering film, and composite film made up of a number of homogeneous materials with known optical properties. A general optical model was also developed for screen-like glazing panes such as insect/shading <b>screens,</b> <b>roller</b> blinds, drapery sheets, honeycomb transparent insulation and fibreglass translucent glazing...|$|R
40|$|Office {{buildings}} with large glass facades often face {{problems such as}} glare, thermal discomfort, overheating and increased energy demand. In this case study, thermal and daylighting simulation were performed in order to investigate the possible options for the facade renovation of a large office building in Montreal. For the daylighting part, the available daylight on the work plane surface of interior perimeter zones was calculated for each façade, considering several shading options: dark <b>screens,</b> <b>roller</b> shades with variable properties, reflective venetian blinds, translucent glazings and combinations of the above. Daylight rendering with and without shading helped in visualizing the results. The impact of different shading properties on glare was also studied, {{as well as the}} impact of window size on annual daylight autonomy for each case. For the thermal part, emphasis was given on the effect of shading location, properties and control on the thermal loads, since the glass facades account for {{a big part of the}} load. It was found that the shade location and properties have a significant impact on heating and cooling load as well as on the thermal comfort near the windows. The simulation results showed that a 60 % reduction in cooling demand – due to the façade- could be achieved, if controlled shades with small or variable transmittance and high outside reflectance will be used...|$|R
40|$|Shading {{devices have}} the {{potential}} to reduce peak cooling load and annual energy consumption because they can be used to control solar gain. Thus, the need to model shading devices in a glazing system analysis is important. This thesis deals with various measurement techniques and model development related to solar optics in windows with shading devices. It also considers longwave radiative properties of shading devices via model development and experimentation. The different shading devices examined were <b>roller</b> blinds, insect <b>screens,</b> pleated drapes and venetian blinds. The energy performance of windows with shading devices was modeled using a two step procedure. Solar radiation was considered in the first step by developing a multi-layer solar optical model for glazing/shading systems. This newly developed model is an extension of an existing model for systems of specular glazing layers and includes the effect of layers that create scattered, specifically diffuse, radiation in reflection and/or transmission. Spatially-averaged (effective) optical properties were used to characterise shading layers, including their beam-diffuse split. The multi-layer solar optical model estimates the system solar transmission and absorbed solar components. The absorbed solar components appear as energy source terms in the second step – the heat transfer analysis. The heat transfer analysis involves the formulation of energy balance equations and requires both effective longwave properties and convective heat transfer coefficients as input. The simultaneous solution of the energy balance equations yields the temperature as well as the convective and radiative fluxes. The effective solar optical properties of flat materials like drapery fabrics, roller blinds and insect screens were obtained by developing a new measurement technique. Special sample holders were designed and fabricated to facilitate measurements using an integrating sphere installed in a commercially available spectrophotometer. Semi-empirical models were then developed to quantify the variation of solar optical properties with respect to incidence angle. In turn, effective layer properties of venetian blinds and pleated drapes were modeled using a more fundamental net radiation scheme. The effective longwave properties of flat materials were obtained by taking measurements with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results enabled simple models to be developed relating emittance and longwave transmittance to openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. In turn, effective longwave properties of venetian blinds and pleated drapes were modeled using a net radiation scheme. Convective heat transfer correlations were readily available. Finally, the newly developed models were validated by measuring the solar gain through various shading devices attached to a double glazed window using the National Solar Test Facility (NSTF) solar simulator and solar calorimeter. Solar gain results were also obtained from simulation software that incorporated the models. There was good agreement between the measured and the simulated results thus strengthening confidence in the newly developed models...|$|R
