40|$|A {{compliant}} bimanual rehabilitation system. The device {{allows for}} the user or operator 2 ̆ 7 s hands to be coupled {{with a variety of}} coupling stiffnesses and in a variety of symmetry modes, leading to enhanced rehabilitation of the impaired arm. Structurally, the device includes a carrier assembly slidably coupled to a base along a y-axis, an upper assembly <b>rotatably</b> <b>coupled</b> to the carrier assembly along a z-axis, handle slides slidably coupled to the upper assembly along an x-axis, compliant handle assemblies coupled to the handle slides, and handles coupled to the compliant handle assemblies. Encoders and load cells can also be positioned accordingly to monitor the position of the components and force applied to the device. Spring stacks can be coupled to the compliant handle assemblies to adjust coupling stiffnesses. The handles are indirectly linked to each other to facilitate rehabilitation of the paretic arm using the sound arm...|$|E
40|$|An {{electrical}} connector split backshell is provided, comprising two substantially identical backshell halves. Each half includes a first {{side and a}} cam projecting therefrom along an axis perpendicular thereto, the cam having an alignment tooth with a constant radius and an engagement section with a radius that increases with angular distance from the alignment tooth. Each half further includes a second side parallel to the first side and a circular sector opening disposed in the second side, the circular sector opening including an inner surface configured as a ramp with a constant radius, the ramp being configured to engage with an engagement section of a cam of the other half, the circular sector opening further including a relieved pocket configured to receive an alignment tooth of the cam of the other half. Each half further includes a back side perpendicular to {{the first and second}} sides and a wire bundle notch disposed in the back side, the wire bundle notch configured to align with a wire bundle notch of the other half to form a wire bundle opening. The two substantially identical halves are <b>rotatably</b> <b>coupled</b> by engaging the engagement section of each half to the ramp of the other half...|$|E
40|$|In {{the field}} of fluid {{containers}} {{there is a need}} to facilitate access to and removal of the contents of a sachet. An extraction assembly for extracting the contents of a sachet comprises a sachet housing to receive a sachet and an extractor. The extractor includes at least one piercing member and an abutment member. The extractor is movable relative to the sachet housing between a first inactive position and a second active position. The extraction assembly also includes an actuator which is operable to move the extractor between the first and second positions. The actuator is <b>rotatably</b> <b>coupled</b> with the sachet housing, and the actuator and the extractor include mutually cooperable formations to translate rotational movement of the actuator into movement of the extractor between the first and second positions. A sachet is insertable into the sachet housing while the extractor is in the first position. Movement of the extractor towards the second position drives the or each piercing member into a sachet received in the sachet housing and traps a portion of the sachet between the abutment member and the sachet housing. This product fits within Unilever’s water conservation strategy to reduce water as well as giving the user a quality experience. Design for non domestic market the product is undergoing consumer trials in India and Africa by Unilever...|$|E
