40|$|This paper explores how contextual {{uncertainty}} {{and the use}} of the budgetary system explain cross-sectional variation in the organisational <b>role</b> <b>of</b> business unit controllers. We argue that there are complementarities between the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the budgetary control system (i. e. coercive vs. enabling) and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the controller (i. e. corporate policeman vs. business partner). Thus, we explore both the direct effect of uncertainty on the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the controller and the indirect effect through the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> the budgetary control system. Using survey data from 134 business unit controllers, we find that uncertainty provides a partial explanation of the variation in the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> budgetary control systems and in the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> controllers. In particular, our data suggest alignment between the coercive (enabling) use of the budgetary control system and the <b>role</b> <b>of</b> controllers acting as corporate policemen (business partners). These findings add to our understanding of the functioning of business unit controllers within their organisational context...|$|R
