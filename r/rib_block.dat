40|$|Purpose: This {{observational}} {{study examined the}} resorptive behavior of normal neonatal rabbit osteoclasts grown on slices of bovine cortical bone as compared to samples of commercially available bone substitute biomaterials. It also examined the surface characteristics of these materials. Materials and Methods: The 11 materials tested fell into 3 groups: (1) bone-derived, including freeze-dried human <b>rib</b> <b>block,</b> human demineralized freeze-dried bone, and deproteinated bovine bone; (2) synthetic hydroxyapatites (HA); and (3) synthetic non-HA, including coated methacrylates and coated silica glass. After 4 days in culture, 1 group of samples of each material underwent scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to evaluate resorptive pitting versus controls, while another group underwent tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining and light microscopy to examine osteoclast numbers and morphology. The 2 bovine-derived HA materials also underwent immunohistochemical staining and surface chemistry analysis. Results: While most of these materials supported osteoclast attachment, some spreading, and survival in culture, only the bone-derived materials, {{with the exception of}} sintered deproteinated bovine bone, showed large scalloped-edged resorption pits with trails and exposed collagen when examined by SEM, although not to the same extent as unprocessed natural bone material. The HA materials and the sintered deproteinated bovine bone showed evidence of etching with smaller pits but no evidence of resorptive trail formation. The non-HA materials showed no evidence of pit formation or trails. Under immunohistochemical staining, Bio-Oss appeared to be positive for type I collagen after osteoclast activity on its surface, while Osteograf/N showed no positive staining. Surface chemistry analysis revealed nitrogen present in Bio-Oss specimens (0. 17 % to 0. 47 %), while there was no nitrogen detected in the Osteograf/N (0. 00 %); the percent nitrogen observed in normal bovine bone controls was 6. 01 % to 9. 25 %. Discussion: The bone-derived materials supported osteoclast activity on the material surface in a way that facilitated formation of the more complex resorption pits in vitro. Assuming the rate of pit formation observed in vitro mimics that observed in vivo, the quantity and type of osteoclastic remodeling seen on non-bone-derived materials-and perhaps sintered bone-derived materials-would be extremely slow to negligible. Physiologic removal of non-bone-derived bone substitutes in vivo may occur by methods other than osteoclast resorption. Conclusions: Allogenous and xenogenous bone-derived materials that undergo delayed physiologic resorption may be more appropriately used with a staged surgical approach when used in sites intended to support osseointegrated dental implants. The combination of collagen staining and the presence of nitrogen suggest that there may be residual protein in Bio-Oss...|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{evaluated}} {{the influence of}} implant site preparation depth on primary stability measured by insertion torque and resonance frequency analysis (RFA). Material and Methods: Thirty-two implant sites were prepared in eight veal <b>rib</b> <b>blocks.</b> Sixteen sites were prepared using the conventional drilling sequence recommended by the manufacturer to a working depth of 10 mm. The remaining 16 sites were prepared using an oversize drilling technique (overpreparation) to a working depth of 12 mm. Bone density was determined using cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). The implants were placed and primary stability was measured by two methods: insertion torque (Ncm), and RFA (implant stability quotient [ISQ]). Results: The highest torque values were achieved by the conventional drilling technique (10 mm). The ANOVA test confirmed {{that there was a}} significant correlation between torque and drilling depth (p 0. 05) at either measurement direction (cortical and medullar).

40|$|The use of lipped channel {{members as}} the {{reinforcing}} for composite beams in <b>rib</b> and <b>block</b> type slab systems is advantageous {{due to its}} lightweight nature which facilitates efficiently in construction. The main consideration in the design if such composite members is {{the integrity of the}} shear bond at the concrete/ steel interface. Premature de-bonding of the concrete from the steel results in an overall loss of structural strength of the composite member. Certain guidelines are to be established to facilitate in the design of such systems. In this research project the shear bond strength of composite members using lipped channel members is investigated by interrogating the results from three independent research experiments. Design formulas from first principles are developed to more easily benchmark the behaviour of such members. Complex and simple equations are developed and the results obtained are compared to similar shear bond stresses obtained from literature. A reasonably acceptable correlation is achieved. A comparative study was also carried out between the various experimental beams regarding vertical shear, flexural strength and short-term deflections. The purpose was to ascertain what effect early shear bond failure has on these structural properties. The formulas used to benchmark the results were the well known formulas used for the design and evaluation of reinforced concrete members. The results were tabulated showing the difference between the calculated and experimental results. As a result of the investigation the following conclusions seem justified :  The simple equations as developed for horizontal shear failure give acceptable results which are within the range as given by more complex equations.  The composite beam has a certain amount of reserve shear strength even after the initial onset of horizontal shear failure. iv  The reinforcing ratio, the concrete strength and the slenderness ratio of the composite beam all have an influence on the level of horizontal stress failure.  The composite beams tend to fail at levels higher than that predicted by the homogeneous shear equations but lower than the predicted flexural equations. The parameters which influence this are again the reinforcing ratio, the concrete strength and the slenderness ratio.  Once a composite beam has experienced shear bond failure the deflection integrity of the beam is completely compromised. The above conclusions show the designer that caution must be exercised when using lipped channel members in <b>rib</b> and <b>block</b> slab systems...|$|R

CATIA V 5 solid modeling software is used extensively in the aerospace industry to design aircraft and aircraft parts. The authors of this paper have incorporated a new project in the AT 166 Aircraft Materials II course to reinforce the knowledge gained in the introductory course and to apply this new skill set to design, and manufacture an aluminum alloy formed wing rib using CNC equipment and conventional sheet metal equipment. For this project students select a wing airfoil using commercial available software based on assigned parameters like gross weight, cruise speed and stall speed. An airfoil for a small piston powered experimental aircraft is selected with a maximum gross weight of 500 pounds, cruise speed of 150 mph, and a stall speed of 50 mph. Airfoil optimizer software is used to download the drawings of the selected airfoil.

30|$|Thoracic {{paravertebral}} block (TPVB) {{is widely}} used for anesthesia and postoperative pain management for BCS [3 – 5]. However, TPVB is generally performed before general anesthesia for surgery, and not all anesthesiologists feel comfortable using such invasive techniques for BCS. Recently, Blanco et al. reported the use of pectoral nerve block (PECSB) as a new technique during BCS [6, 7]. PECSB is an interfascial plane block where local anesthetic is deposited into the plane between the pectoralis major muscle and the pectoralis minor muscle (PECS-I block) and above the serratus anterior muscle at the third <b>rib</b> (PECS-II block); <b>blocking</b> the pectoral; intercostobrachial; intercostals III, IV, V, and VI; and long thoracic nerves by PECSB is expected to provide analgesia for BCS [6, 7].

Interestingly, Bashandy and Abbas recently reported that PECSB was able to reduce intraoperative fentanyl requirement, postoperative pain, postoperative morphine consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in patients undergoing BCS [8].|$|R
40|$|Epidural blocks {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in infants. However, little histological information {{is available on the}} immature neural-dural transition. The neural-dural transition was histologically investigated in 12 late-stage (28 – 30 weeks) fetuses. The dural sheath of the spinal cord was observed to always continue along the nerve roots with varying thicknesses between specimens and segments, while the dorsal root ganglion sheath was usually very thin or unclear. Immature neural-dural transitions were associated with effective anesthesia. The posterior radicular artery was near the dorsal root ganglion and/or embedded in the nerve root, whereas the anterior radicular artery was separated from the nearest nerve root. The anterior radicular artery was not associated with the dural sheath but with thin mesenchymal tissue. The numbers of radicular arteries tended to become smaller in larger specimens. Likewise, larger specimens of the upper thoracic and lower lumbar segments did not show the artery. Therefore, elimination of the radicular arteries to form a single artery of Adamkiewicz was occurring in late-stage fetuses.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} tractive performance of different tire treads on granular terrain by an efficient {{combination of the}} Discrete Element Method (DEM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM). The proposed coupling method {{has been shown to}} be a sufficient technique when resolving the different length scales involved in engineering problems dealing with granular assemblies in contact with deformable bodies [1][2]. Herein, the extended discrete element method (XDEM) is used to describe the dynamics of the granular assembly. Thereby the discrete approach accounts for the motion and forces of each grain individually. On the other hand, the finite element method accurately predicts the deformations and stresses acting within the tire tread. Hence, the simulation domain occupied by the tire is efficiently described as a continuous entity. The coupling of both method is based on the interface shared by the two spatially separated domains. The interface coupling enables to apply a contact model fitting the particular contact behaviour between the grains and the tread surface. Thus, contact forces develop at the interface and propagate into each domain. The coupling method enables to capture both responses simultaneously. Each grain in contact with the tread surface generates a contact force which it reacts on repulsively. The contact forces sum up over the surface and cause the tire tread to deform. The resultant stresses are then again recognised by the granular assembly. The coupling method compensates quite naturally the shortages of both numerical methods. It further employs a fast contact detection algorithm to spare valuable computation time [1]. The proposed DEM-FEM Coupling technique was employed to study the tractive performance of four different tire treads on a soil layer of the material sand. The simulations were conducted in accordance to the experimental measurements undertaken by Shinone et al. [3]. The contact forces at the surface of smooth, lug, <b>rib</b> and <b>block</b> tread patterns are captured by 3 D simulations of different slip values of each tire tread. The simulation results are used to analyse the gross tractive effort, running resistance and drawbar pull of the different tread patterns in sand...|$|R
50|$|Acceleration (0-60) for the 4-cylinder {{models is}} {{improved}} (around the mid-9-second mark), with comparable fuel efficiency to its predecessor: 23 mpg/city and 30 mpg/hwy for LX and EX models with automatic transmissions. Emissions of Non-Methane Organic Gases (NMOG), {{also known as}} unburned hydrocarbons, produced during engine warm-up are considerably lower. The LX and EX engines produce less than 0.0075 grams per mile, qualifying them for California LEV (Low-Emission Vehicle) status. In California, the Accord EX with the available automatic transmission will produce less than 0.003 grams per mile of NMOG, qualifying it as the first gasoline-powered vehicle to reach ULEV (Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle) status. The five-main bearing block is high-pressure die-cast from aluminum alloy. The walls of the block extend below the centerline of the crankshaft, which helps stiffen the bottom end. FEM (Finite Element Method) computer {{analysis was used to}} arrive at optimum thicknesses for the <b>block</b> <b>ribs</b> and walls in order to minimize engine vibration. Additional bottom-end rigidity comes from a larger, stronger bearing-cap beam that ties directly into the cylinder-block skirt. An aluminum-alloy stiffener has been added between the transmission case and the block, just behind the bearing carrier. The stiffener serves to tie the block and transmission together into a single, reinforced unit. FEM was also used to design this stiffener so that it would not only stiffen the area, but also help minimize high-frequency engine vibration. Finite-element analysis of the Accord's piston design by Honda engineers yielded a new ultra-short, lightweight skirt design, which is very rigid and resistant to vibration and piston slap. Like the V-6 engine the pistons are gravity-cast aluminum alloy and utilize full-floating wrist pins in order to minimize noise. The engine's drop-forged single-plane steel crankshaft and connecting rods have been designed to be stronger and operate with less friction, much like the V-6 components. The I-section, drop-forged steel connecting rods have a completely new design and are considerably lighter than their predecessors (475 g vs. 578 g), which helps to minimize vibration. Big end-bearing journal diameter has been reduced from 48 mm to 45 mm. Rod thickness is down from 24 mm to 20 mm and the bolt size is smaller. Like the V-6 rod bolts, those of the 4-cylinder engine are torqued to the plastic region of the bolt material in order to ensure a solid union between the bearing cap and the connecting rod. The engine block incorporates the Honda-designed second-order balance system that cancels the inertial forces common to large-displacement 4-cylinder engines. The system consists of two parallel shafts {{on either side of the}} crank-shaft, 81 mm (3.19 in.) above its centerline. Driven by a toothed belt, the balance shafts rotate in opposite directions at twice engine speed. Eccentric weights built into the shafts generate inertial forces that counteract the second-order forces created by the motion of the pistons and connecting rods. This Honda system minimizes vibration in the entire rpm range.|$|R
