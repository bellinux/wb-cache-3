A strikingly low proportion of district <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> was absorbed by salaries and wages (27 - 39 %, depending on the district) and a surprisingly high proportion by medical supplies (24 - 37 %). The most expensive cost centre in the hospital was the pharmacy. A total of 27 - 39 % of total <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs</b> were spent outside the hospital and 61 - 73 % on hospital services. The secondary care services absorbed 40 - 58 % of district <b>recurrent</b> <b>costs.</b> Unit costs by hospital department varied considerably by district, with one hospital being consistently the most expensive and another the cheapest. A total of 3 - 10 new outpatients could be treated for the average cost of 1 inpatient-day, while 34 - 55 could be treated for the average cost of 1 inpatient.

Recurrent costs which are those costs recurring annually in the form of operating, maintenance, debt servicing and others costs required for the support of capital facilities require increased analysis if municipalities are to avoid the problems of over-expansion, under-financing and loss of productivity. By analyzing recurrent costs, municipalities will be able to assess the fiscal impact of capital expenditures and as such, meet the financial challenges of the future. All urban municipalities in Canada over the population of 75, 000 were surveyed to determine the following: 1) the number of municipalities which analyze recurrent costs 2) the type of recurrent costs analyzed 3) the estimated dollar impact of recurrent costs 4) the type of decision-making groups presented with <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> information; and 5) the difference between those municipalities which analyze recurrent costs and those which do not. The results of the study indicated that the majority of urban municipalities analyze recurrent costs but many of the municipalities ignor very important recurrent costs in their analysis. The average <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> of municipalities was estimated at 10 cents for every dollar of capital expenditure. Although this <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> coefficient is reasonable when compared to other findings, caution should be exercixed with its use.

Method: Six BHUs {{were randomly selected from}} each of the five districts in Khyber Pukhtonkhawa (KPK) and two agencies in Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) of Pakistan for this study. Actual expenditure data and utilization data in the year 2005 – 06 of 42 BHUs was collected from selected district health offices in KPK and FATA. Costs were estimated for outpatient visits to BHUs. Perspective on cost estimates was district-based health planning and management of BHUs. Results:Average recurring cost was PKR. 245 (USD 4. 1) per OPV to BHU.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{estimate}} the wound treatment cost {{borne by the}} Buruli Ulcer Treatment Centre of the Amasaman Government Hospital, Ghana. MethodsThree different types of data collection approaches were used, namely, 1) observation checklist, 2) in-depth interviews, and 3) expenditure data review. Wound dressing processes were observed. Retrospective health facility cost data of Buruli ulcer (BU) wound treatment for the year 2011 were used. Cost data gathered covered medical and nonmedical items. Cost analyses were carried out to determine the health facility’s financial and economic costs. ResultsThe total annual financial cost was US $ 121, 189. 16, of which 99 % was <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost.</b> This constitutes about 13 % of the expenditure by the Amasaman Government Hospital for the year 2011. The total annual economic cost was US $ 143, 609. 22, of which 93 % was <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost.</b> The main cost driver for both financial and economic costs was personnel. The annual BU wound treatment costs per capita were US $ 1615. 86 for financial cost and US $ 1914. 79 for economic cost, respectively. The study did not cover household patient costs. ConclusionsThe cost of BU wound treatment takes {{a considerable amount of}} the hospital’s expenditure. This shows the importance of health facility cost as one of the decision-making tools for both resource allocation and mobilization. Hospital management must therefore constantly examine its staffing norms and the associated cost to improve the hospital’s resource allocation...|$|E
40|$|In {{contrast}} to the existing literature, which explains the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> problem as largely the result of institutional impediments to LDC welfare maximization, this paper analyzes the problem by constructing a series of scenarios in which the less developed country would be led to reduce the flow of recurrent inputs to a development project {{in order to maximize}} its own welfare. A distinction is drawn between situations in which the project design is correct ex ante, and those in which it is wrong ex ante. If the project design is correct ex ante, then the recipient country which deviates from the project design does so at a cost to its own welfare unless {{one or more of the}} assumptions embodied in the project design have turned out to be false. This paper develops a typology of the possible "surprises" that could lead a host country to reduce recurrent input to a project in order to maximize social welfare. It is proposed that donors use such a typology to help determine the true cause of recurrent input reduction in any given instance. An alternative possible reason for the host country to reduce recurrent inputs to a project is that the project was incorrectly designed in the first place: i. e. the project design could be wrong ex ante. The paper uses a simple model of donor and recipient nation objectives to describe the contractarian relationship between the two nations with respect to the project design and implementation process. According to the model, the donor and recipient countries have a common interest in the output of the development project, but their interests are not identical. In the situation described by the model, both nations have an incentive to agree to a project design that is wrong ex ante. Subsequently the LDC’s reduction of recurrent input can be viewed as its attempt to do the best it can given the inappropriate project with which it is saddled. The analysis is illustrated with a modified Edgeworth-Bowley box diagram. Finally, the paper demonstrates that, like the free-rider problem, the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> problem can be formulated as a variety of the “prisoner’s dilemma” game form. This observation leads to several policy recommendations for the resolution of the <b>recurrent</b> <b>cost</b> problem which are analogous to the solutions that have been developed for the general free-rider problem as it is characterized by the prisoner’s dilemma. The paper concludes by summarizing the major policy recommendations of the analysis and by discussing some of the possible difficulties that would arise in attempting to implement the recommended policies. ...|$|E

In addition the funds are channels for community participation in the management and improvement of health services.
