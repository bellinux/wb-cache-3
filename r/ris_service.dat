In this presentation, firstly, we consider these hazardous weather phenomena and their local characteristics according to our investigating experience on the lowland waterway of the Danube. Secondly, we give more examples what kind of other weather related measurements from different branches of transportation and industry proved useful in reconstructions and can be applied operatively in prevention. We give some solutions as well where to extend them to form a weather monitoring system focusing especially on the demands of inland skippers. Thirdly, we consider how those observations (or measurements) can be handled by RIS services which crews would give on a common interest base, and what standardisation and regulation background should be set to make it work as in the field of aviation...|$|E

40|$|The {{transport}} sector {{and in particular}} inland waterway transport, is increasing the use of information and communication technology (ICT). The use of ICT can improve this mode of transport eg efficiency and the competition with road transport. An ICT concept, called <b>RIS,</b> River Information <b>Services,</b> is developed during the last years for the exchange of information with inland vessels {{for a number of}} applications. To bring this concept alive, a research project, INDRIS (Inland Navigation Demonstrator for River lnformation Services), was defined to establish standards for the information flows in terms of data elements, protocols and communication means as well as to demonstrate the principles of the concept. INDRIS is carried out by governmental bodies, transport industry, shipping industry and research institutes in The Netherlands, Austria, Germany, Belgium and France. The RIS concept covers navigation, safety and logistìc applications. For this reason it was necessary to define data communication and communication systems for time critical applications (real time), such as navigation and safety related data exchange, and not time critical applications eg reporting, gathering fairway information, weather reports and planning. For time critical data communication the Automatic Identification System, AIS, is chosen. This paper describes Inland AIS as demonstrated in INDRIS...|$|R

40|$|Many {{organizations}} have {{the mission of}} assessing the quality of broadband access services offered by Internet Service Providers (ISPs). They deploy network probes that periodically perform network measures towards se-lected Internet services. By analyzing the data collected by the probes it is often possible to gain a reasonable es-timate of the bandwidth made available by the ISP. How-ever, {{it is much more}} difficult to use such data to explain who is responsible of the fluctuations of other network qualities. This is especially true for latency, that is fun-damental for several nowadays network services. On the other hand, there are many publicly accessible BGP routers that collect the history of routing changes and that are good candidates to be used for understanding if latency fluctuations depend on interdomain routing. In this paper we provide a methodology that, given a probe that is located inside the network of an ISP and that executes latency measures and given a set of pub-licly accessible BGP routers located inside the same ISP, decides which routers are best candidates (if any) for studying the relationship between variations of network performance recorded by the probe and interdomain rout-ing changes.

40|$|This report {{addresses}} computer {{support of}} complex cooperative work involving many actors. These actors might be distributed {{in time and}} space while collaborating. It is discussed which aspects of the coordination of cooperative work it would be relevant to consider supported by means of computer-based systems. A conceptual framework for analyzing and modeling the basic mechanisms used when mutually interdependent actors coordinate their distibuted activities is proposed. The framework is based on an analytical distinction between work and its coordination, and an explicit separation between the field of work and the work arrangement performing the work. A frame of reference for the dimensions of coordination work along which the coordination is conducted is included in the framework. Findings from a field study addressing the coordination of software design work in a manufacturing company is analyzed by means of the conceptual framework, and a prototype of a computer based coordination mechanism is presented. Based on the experiences accumulated from these activities a series of lessons learned is discussed. The lessons are mainly concerned with analysis of coordination of cooperative work and how to design computer-based systems supporting coordination work. This is a Ph.

RINAC deals with a concept of the bridge (wheel-house) of an inland navigation vessel, to {{operate in a}}n RIS environment. RINAC stands for River Information, Navigation And Communication system, and describes an architecture of the future bridge of an inland vessel {{as a result of}} a study in the Fourth Framework Program of the European Commission. This architecture is based on the two most important tasks of an inland navigation skipper. The first one comprises the tactical tasks like monitoring the traffic environment and making manoeuvring decisions. The RIS concept will assist the skipper to complete the traffic image aboard with additional information in particular on places where the onboard radar cannot oversee the situation. The second task of the skipper is called the strategic task. This includes gathering information from the fairway for voyage planning, cargo loading etc. Reporting dangerous goods is another strategic task that will be part of the RIS concept. The Human Machine Interface, the way how to work with this tool, and how to present the information, forms a part of this study. RINAC describes also the communication requirements as integrated part of the RINAC set-up. Tactical communication must be real time and meet very high reliability and availability of standards. It deals with safety and navigation. Communication for strategic purposes is less time critical and can be obtained from public communication networks. Communication must be transparent for the user. The system decides how data exchange will take place and which available communication means and protocols will be used.

Aalto University has a tenure track system with clearly set evaluation criteria and selection process. The tenure track evaluation criteria {{is based on the}} principles of predictability, transparency, and comparability with international standards. Bibliometric analysis have been an integrated part of Aalto University recruiting processes since 2011 and the bibliometric service portfolio has evolved to support the different phases of the tenure track system. The services are all a result of collaboration between several sections of the university: the Management Information Services (MIS) unit coordinates the bibliometric analysis and collaboration partners include HR, the Learning Centre (Library), Research and Innovation <b>Services</b> (<b>RIS),</b> and the selection committees of the schools. In the publication analysis the international bibliometric indicators are used and the overall methodology follows the policies highlighted e. g. in the Leiden Manifesto and the Acumen Portfolio. The poster will give an overview of the current bibliometric service portfolio, the respective partnerships of the service in question, and volume of the service. The poster will focus on the recently launched new service, the Talent Search that aims to identify and attract good candidates to apply for a tenure track position at Aalto University.

40|$|Soilse is the Health Service Executive's {{addiction}} {{rehabilitation service}} {{and is based}} in Dublin city centre. Our mission {{is to provide a}} comprehensive, holistic addiction rehabilitation service that empowers those in recovery to move towards a drug-free lifestyle. 2013 was a year of consolidation and change at Soilse. Our Henrietta Place programme slowly came back on stream following its closure for the last six months of 2012 {{due to a lack of}} staff. In response, we reconfigured staff and made recovery the core focus of our activities. This was manifested in several ways: •	The EU Lifelong Learning Grundtvig proposal on recovery and adult education, in which we are involved along with four other European counties, was accepted by Brussels. •	We identified eight ‘recovery coaches’ who are training in Dublin City University (DCU) in a course also sponsored by Finglas Addiction Support Team (FAST). •	We placed a bigger recovery emphasis into the programme in terms of groups, aftercare, fellowships and so on. •	We began working on a paper to illustrate the potential of recovery in an Irish context (see Principles of Recovery, Appendix 2). •	We held a Recovery Week for Henrietta Place participants before Christmas focusing on relapse prevention, treatment, CBT, planning for Christmas, NA meetings and recovery education. Our links within the HSE Northern Area continuum improved significantly due to greater dialogue and co-operation. Uniquely in Ireland, this continuum consists of a detox preparation programme (Soilse), a detox (Cuan Dara), a therapeutic residential treatment (Keltoi) and a drug-free programme (Soilse). This is supported through the process by the Rehabilitation Integration <b>Service</b> (<b>RIS).</b> We continued our partnership with the City of Dublin Education and Training Board (formerly CDVEC), offering service users literacy support, career guidance and the opportunity to attain Level 3 FETAC awards including a full certificate.

40|$|The Internet is an {{interconnection}} {{of administrative}} domains called Autonomous Systems (ASes). Each AS contains one or multiple destination networks and each network is identified by an IP prefix. The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) [RLH 06] is the de-facto standard routing protocol used to exchange reachability information among ASes and a BGP session between two distinct ASes is called peering. Each AS learns through BGP its "best" route towards each destination in the Internet, updates it {{in response to}} network events (e. g., link failures, router resets, or policy changes) and propagates the change by BGP messages called updates. The propagation of BGP updates can be par- tially controlled via routing policy specifications. In order to investigate the Internet behavior over time, several repositories provide historical data. Since 1997 and 1999, respectively, the University of Oregon RouteViews Project (RV) [roua] and the RIPE NCC Routing Infor- mation <b>Service</b> (<b>RIS)</b> [roub] spread worldwide passive monitors (or vantage points), which continuously gather BGP routing data from the Internet, per- manently store them and make them publicly available. Currently, there are about 800 such monitors. Also, in 1995 the Internet Routing Registry (IRR) was established and started collecting inter-AS routing policies {{of many of the}} networks in the Internet with the main purpose to promote stability, consis- tency, and security of the global interdomain routing. As the Internet becomes a more and more critical infrastructure, the need for understanding and (at least at some extent) controlling the interdomain routing increases. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) - in order {{to improve the quality of}} service offered to their customers - want to monitor the reachability of specific prefixes, check the effectiveness of their own routing policies, and assess the impact of traffic engineering configurations. In this context, it is crucial to be able to detect and debug misconfigurations or faults, in order to possibly fix them. More generally, the problem of identifying Internet events, locating their root causes, and understanding their dynamics is attracting increasing attention from both researchers and network operators. However, despite the large amount of research effort, routing dynamics di- agnosis remains very difficult for several reasons: (i) The system has a sheer size. As of December 2008, there are about 280, 000 prefixes and more than 30, 000 Autonomous Systems densely connected between each other. (ii) The Internet is highly dynamic. In fact, RIS' and RV's monitors currently receive an average of about 1, 500 BGP updates per minute, with peaks of more than 50, 000 updates per minute. (iii) Due to complex interconnects among ASes and routing policies, the effects of network events are often separated (both in time and space) from their causes and different vantage points record different data in response to the same routing changes. Also, multiple routing events can occur simultaneously. Overall, given such size and dynamics, "naive" ap- proaches to extract relevant information from the Internet routing data are neither effective nor efficient. Therefore, both researchers and network operators interested in understand- ing the interdomain routing have to cope with several major challenges. First, in order to deal with such a huge and complex network, they need to define what to measure, i. e., they need a model of the Internet routing that captures the main dynamics, filtering out the "noise" (e. g., routing changes that do not provide information relevant to the identification of network events). Based on such model, they need a methodology that, given the currently available data sources, detects network events and infers when and where they hap- pened. Furthermore, they need tools that efficiently handle the huge amount of data, support the analysis of the network behavior over time, and provide real-time information in order to spot and possibly fix outages as soon as they occur. Since the analysis of network events often requires manual work, ef- fective paradigms for the visualization of routing data are also very helpful. Previous works leave most of these problems still open. The research work described throughout this thesis addresses these prob- lems and proposes approaches to (at least partially) solve them. Namely, this thesis presents the following contributions. This thesis illustrates a new perspective to drive the analysis of the Internet dynamics without getting lost in the huge BGP dataset. Basically, while previ- ous works usually address the root cause analysis from a "global perspective" - i. e., by taking into account the dynamics of the whole Internet and trying to identify major events affecting it - this thesis tackles the same problem with an ISP-oriented approach: it assumes that ISPs are usually more interested in the reachability of their own prefixes, rather than in the status of the whole Network; hence, it focuses the analysis on user-specified prefixes and corre- lates their behaviors to the global Internet dynamics. In particular, this thesis formally models the Internet as a flow-based system, where monitors are the sources of the flows and ASes originating BGP updates are the sinks. This thesis also defines a methodology which correlates such flow variations to rout- ing changes in order to spot network events and the root causes that triggered them. Furthermore, BGPath has been developed to support this methodol- ogy and this thesis describes its main features. BGPath is a publicly available tool that uses BGP data collected by the RIS and the RV projects and pro- vides the user with routing information from both a single and cross-vantage point views. BGPath also assesses the reliability of the collection system, in order to avoid measurement artifacts. The algorithms BGPath relies on are shown to efficiently process huge streams of BGP data, fulfilling nearly-real time constraints. While the ISP-oriented approach presented in this thesis gives a good in- sight on both major and minor events affecting specific portions of the Internet, approaching the root cause analysis problem from a "global perspective" usu- ally does not provide with such fine-grained results. On the other hand, the global approach is critical to identify major interdomain events, without any a- priori knowledge of the prefixes and/or the ASes involved. This thesis explores this perspective too. Specifically, this thesis proposes a novel methodology based on the Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a well-known statistical technique that is commonly used to reduce the number of dimensions of multi- dimensional datasets in order to highlight the most significant trends of the data. Since the interdomain routing dataset is inherently multi-dimensional (in time, space, prefixes, observation points, [...] .), this thesis suggests to apply the PCA to this dataset in order to identify the most significant contributors to the Internet dynamics. BGP data collected by RIS' and RV's monitors provide a detailed view of the actual status of the interdomain routing. However, it does not report all the inter-AS peering relationships which are not active. For example, in "normal" conditions, backup links do not appear in the routing tables. Still, in order to understand the reasons behind some network events and to pre- dict the evolution of the routing when an event occurs, such information is actually very important. To cope with the intrinsic limitations of the RIS and RV dataset, this thesis analyzes the data stored in the Internet Routing Reg- istry and describes how to extract peering relationships from routing policies collected within. Moreover, the proposed approach specifies how to solve in- consistencies among the distinct databases the IRR consists of. The obtained results show that - even though the IRR data is often out-of-date, it still pro- vides a quite unique amount of topological information which usually does not appear in the global routing. The research work described in the thesis relies on the assumption that Internet is a graph where ASes are atomic entities in the interdomain rout- ing. However, recent papers [MFM+ 06, MUF+ 07] show that such a model can mislead the understanding of the global routing behavior. Thus, this thesis in- vestigates this problem by measuring the route diversity that can be observed by passive remote vantage points, defining a methodology to compute it from a dynamic BGP dataset and characterizing it in terms of location of ASes in the Internet customer-provider hierarchy and choice of monitors. The thesis documents forensic analysis of two well-know events that oc- curred at the beginning of 2007, where models, methodologies and tools de- scribed in the thesis are exemplified using real case studies...|$|R
40|$|The Employer Engagement Initiative (EEI) at the University of Southampton {{aimed to}} {{increase}} the coherence of the University?s approach to employer engagement, especially its ability to offer flexible education at postgraduate level {{in the shape of}} work-based learning (WBL), online/e-learning and flexible programmes. In doing this, the Initiative sought to facilitate employee learning, address employer needs, and contribute to the long-term development of the University in line with University strategic priorities. The Initiative was originally planned to consist of three phases: 1. Building and testing flexible academic processes for employer engagement, 2008 ? 2010, 2. Cascading, extending and capacity building, 2010 ? 2012, 3. Formalising and integrating employer engagement activity (no funds sought for Phase Three). (Employer Engagement Initiative, Annexe A, Business Plan) The overall aims of the Initiative as expressed in the bid were to: 1. Address the current fragmented approach to employer engagement 2. Make changes to our [the University?s] academic processes to enable flexible delivery of M level education 3. Fund three pilot projects at M level to test cooperation with Business, through content, flexible delivery and new funding mechanisms. 4. Establish a Design Centre at Southampton responding to the needs of employers. (Employer Engagement Initiative Summary Document, Annex B, 2007) The evaluation The evaluation provided ongoing formative evaluation {{during the course of the}} Initiative and a summative evaluation in Autumn 2010. Such an evaluation is not straightforward. Cultural change and impact are hard to assess and may take years to evolve. It is not easy to separate out the effects of a particular initiative and other intervening factors. In this report, we can only provide an interim assessment of what has happened and what the effects appear to be so far, with some tentative predictions about the future (especially given the current unsettled state of British higher education). Phase 1 September 2008 ?April 2009 The purposes of this phase were to: ? improve our (evaluator) understandings of this complex Initiative; ? provide a baseline understanding for the EEI team of the project?s starting points in terms of positions, expectations and feelings of the various people involved; ? provide some initial, tentative feedback on progress of the Initiative; ? inform the design of the second phase of the evaluation. Phase 2 May 2009 -August 2010 The purposes of this phase were to: vi ? provide further understandings for the EEI team of the Initiative?s development, based on the perceptions of the various stakeholders involved and our interpretations of those; ? provide ongoing formative feedback on the progress of the Initiative; ? produce a summative report. There are various components to the Initiative and it has been necessary to speak to a wide range of those involved: EEI team members; Steering Group members; Research and Innovation <b>Services</b> (<b>RIS)</b> representatives; pilot Masters programme representatives; Business Fellows; and others with relevant knowledge. We have carried out 31 interviews with 25 people. Contextual factors Contextual factors played a central role in the working of the Employer Engagement Initiative (EEI). The change in external economic conditions between 2007, when the bid was written, and 2008 when the Initiative started meant that the EEI functioned in a vastly different environment from that envisaged by the bid?s authors and the Higher Education Funding Council and had a profound effect on what the Initiative was able to achieve. Employers were less able to finance continuing professional development (CPD) for their employees. The internal university environment also had a powerful effect on achievements. Initial staffing challenges delayed the start of the Initiative. In October 2009 a new Vice-Chancellor took office, initiating and pursuing policies likely to encourage the development of flexible delivery of courses, but also initiating a period of reorganisation. This made it more difficult to achieve concrete changes during this period because of the uncertainties about structures, processes and the role of relevant personnel in the new structure. Key Findings The evaluation?s key findings are reported in relation to each of the Initiative?s central aims: Aim 1 Increasing the coherence of the university approach to employer engagement The EEI achieved the following: ? Worked with RIS to develop the university?s virtual Gateway, through enhancing presentation of the existing CPD offer and assisting with an analysis of competitor websites; ? Directly engaged in or facilitated the following processes: general awareness raising within the university; awareness raising of needs and interests external to the university; specific interactions between particular university units and employers and sector representatives; adding CPD discussions to existing meetings between the university and employers; and a contribution to cultural change in the university; ? Implemented three audit and mapping activities (an initial audit of existing flexible, postgraduate provision, a mapping project for the Maritime University Strategic Research Group, and an assessment of university activity within the maritime sector); ? Developed understandings about what was and what was not likely to be of interest to employers; ? Contributed to the development of a Corporate Relationship Strategy. Although several factors assisted the Initiative (the existence and contributions of Research and Innovation Services, Careers Destinations, existing academic-employer links), other factors posed challenges for the EEI (non-standard processes across 20 Schools, communication within a large university and the difficulties of building trust between different parts of the institution with different processes, structures, personnel and cultures). vii Aim 2 Changes to academic processes to enable flexible delivery of M level education The EEI achieved the following: ? Submitted the business case for changing various administrative systems in the University which will make flexible delivery more possible; ? A Technology Enhanced Learning Guide offering principles of practice, identifying key issues for planning and managing TEL projects, seeking to encourage academic engagement in TEL, and providing details of internal and external people and organisations to contact about proposed projects; ? Reviewing the quality assurance procedures of the University and assessing their suitability for employer responsive provision, and proposing various options for quality assurance of flexible learning courses; ? Input into the Curriculum Innovation Programme within the University, especially the sub-sections of postgraduate taught courses and continuing professional development; ? Initiation of discussion about various financial aspects of flexible provision, including payment-inkind and actual costs of teaching particular courses. Although some factors assisted the EEI (the possibility of ?workarounds? and a culture of working things out), others worked against the Initiative including registration, financial, IT and quality systems designed to support full-time students on full-length programmes. Aim 3 Pilot projects The EEI achieved the following: ? As this report goes to press, a flexibly delivered, postgraduate certificate in Environmental Health, leading potentially to a full Masters pathway, is being developed. Not only will this deliver a new programme to the university, but also a model of how such a course can be developed using a variety of expertise, including that of freelance learning designers. ? One module in an Energy Certificate has been developed. ? The team has been involved in exploring in some depth the possibility of an undergraduate programme tailored to the needs of a specific employer, the outcome of this is as yet unclear. Although some factors assisted the EEI in developing its pilots of postgraduate flexible provision (pre-existing flexible units and programmes within the University with related expertise in programme development, administration and marketing), other factors provided challenges including the traditional focus in the university on full-time, traditional-age students which meant there was little incentive or need for Schools or academics to investigate other models. Various options for development were explored as the project developed. Aim 4 Design Centre The loss of the building where the Design Centre was to be was an early major blow to the Initiative, making it impossible to have such a Centre. Other matters The EEI aimed to recruit 60 new M level FTE students on to flexible credit-based courses, co-funded by employers. It had been envisaged that the ASN allocation would be used on the pilot courses described previously. This proved problematic for three main reasons: ? Suitable courses could not be developed in time, although the new Environment Health Certificate should recruit from October 2011 on a part-time basis. ? ASNs were difficult to use. In order to get 60 ASNs (FTE), the university would need to recruit perhaps 200 or 250 part-time Masters students for a year to do one or two modules in order to reach 60 ASNs. viii ? The University has other groups of students who may fit the ASN criteria, but it is hard to access the relevant data as it is currently not routinely collected. This picture was complicated by the somewhat complex and unclear nature of the funding for ASNs. Emerging themes Engagement with employers presents universities with various dilemmas and challenges relating to the nature and extent of risk taken on and effort and resources invested, as priorities are balanced. These are documented in this report and are also clearly visible in the wider literature (inter alia Bolden et al. 2010; Connor and Hirsh 2008; and the Lambert Review 2003). There are significant cultural differences within sub-sections of the University as well as between the University and employers. Such differences are well documented in the external literature. Such cultural differences will continue to exist, given the complex nature of higher education. We suggest that the negative effects as regards engagement with employers can be minimised by the recommendations below. Short-term funding affects the nature of goals and achievements; it is hard to develop sustainable relationships, processes and products within short funding periods. Recommendations The University should make a clear decision about how far, if at all, it wants to position itself with regard to employer engagement in M level provision (and across the curriculum) and take action accordingly. Is it a strategic priority? If so, certain steps should be taken to facilitate such activity. These include: ? A clearer and more explicit path of authority and leadership for employer and community engagement within the University to signal its importance. ? Systemic co-ordination of relationships and systems within the University as regards employer engagement, through strategies, formalised systems of co-operation and audit and mapping activities. ? More active interactions outside the University at e. g. industry/university matching events, perhaps with a particular focus on large employers and existing employer partnerships. ? Adjustment of working patterns, workload models and promotion systems within the University to facilitate some staff focusing on such employer engagement. ? Adjustment of financial, registration and accreditation systems and requirements to enable more flexible provision. ? More flexible support of e-learning provision. ? The limitations of short-term funding must be considered and recognised in bids, which should be based on realistic, achievable aims within the timescale. ? Achievements are likely to be enhanced by clear line management structures within short-term projects and by co-location of those responsible for ?delivering the project?...|$|R
