As far as the customer foreclosure <b>risks</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> single branding are concerned, it comes to the conclusion that Regulation 2790 / 1999 wrongly focuses on the market share of the seller and should concentrate on the market share of the acquirer. Symetrically, in so far as the input foreclosure <b>risks</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> exclusive purchasing are concerned, Regulation 2790 / 1999 should focus on the market share of the seller.

40|$|There are {{two broad}} {{categories}} of risk affecting supply chain design and management: (1) <b>risks</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> {{the problems of}} coordinating supply and demand, and (2) <b>risks</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> disruptions to normal activities.

The paper provides a conceptual framework that reflects the joint activities of risk assessment and risk mitigation that are fundamental to disruption risk management in supply chains. We then consider empirical results from a rich data set covering the period 1995 – 2000 on accidents in the U. S. Chemical Industry. Based on these results and other literature, we discuss the implications for the design of management systems intended to cope with supply chain disruption risks.

40|$|Traditional {{security}} risk assessment takes a broad asset-based view of organizations. The risk identification process therefore focuses on well-known threats and vulnerabilities to static and discrete assets that {{fall within the}} scope of organizational boundaries under investigation. It does not offer a methodology or framework that systematically deals with <b>risks</b> that <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the complex interdependencies 1 between the critical infrastructures 4. To support this proposition, this paper conducts a systematic analysis of the {{security risk}}s resulting from logical, cyber, geographical and physical interdependencies between telecommunications and power infrastructures. The analysis demonstrates that certain security <b>risks</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> interdependencies cannot be identified using the traditional risk identification approach. A process model is then proposed to extend existing risk methodologies to include a systematic identification of the security <b>risks</b> that <b>arise</b> <b>from</b> the interdependencies of infrastructures...|$|R

As {{a result of this}} development, how to classify financial instruments, recognition of these principles has become important. As a result of the every day increase in types of financial instruments, financial risks have emerged. Especially {{after the end of the}} Bretton Woods system that based on fixed exchange rates in 1970 ’s, entities faced the financial risk. IAS 39 gathered financial risks faced by businesses in the financial markets in three groups. These <b>risks</b> are <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> financial instruments at fair value and <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> cash flows and <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> the net investment in a foreign operation. Preventing <b>from</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>arising</b> <b>from</b> the net investment in a foreign operation hedge that composes the subject of this study and also one type of prevention from financial risk, is explained in Turkish Accounting Standards TAS 21 and TAS 39. The implementation section of this study, one of the varieties of hedging, hedge accounting is an example of a net investment in a foreign operation. Example implementation is divided into three sections. In the first part, the increase and decreases at the exchange rates that <b>arised</b> <b>from</b> the position in which the entity made investment does not make forward contracts arised exchange rates are shown.
