5|$|In January 2013, NJDOT {{announced}} that {{work on the}} $335 million projects for <b>repaving</b> and restoration of the roadway would begin {{at the end of}} 2013. To facilitate the work, the eastbound lanes (northbound US1/9) would close for two years after the Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 at the nearby Meadowlands Sports Complex. The proposal was opposed by local politicians, who contended that it did not satisfactorily address the effect on local traffic and called for more thorough investigation into alternatives. The closure date was postponed by NJDOT to more completely work out comprehensive traffic and travel options.|$|E
5|$|NJDOT {{started the}} I-287 (Middlesex Freeway) Rehabilitation Project in August 2007 to {{resurface}} the pavement between exit5 in South Plainfield and I-95/New Jersey Turnpike in Edison Township, {{which is used}} by about 150,000 vehicles daily. Some of the bridges and overpasses had deteriorated to such a state {{that they needed to}} be replaced. On September16, 2009, NJDOT announced the start of another rehabilitation and <b>repaving</b> project from exit5 in Piscataway to the area of exit10 in Franklin Township. This project, which is being funded by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, is to cost $29 million and is expected to be finished later in 2011.|$|E
5|$|A {{business}} loop for Indian River {{was first}} proposed to the Cheboygan County Road Commission (CCRC) in June 2015. At the time, the road commission had recently placed the bridge on South Straits Highway over the Indian River {{with a new}} structure up to Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) standards and was <b>repaving</b> the roadway north of the river to the I-75 interchange. The CCRC held a community forum in June 2016, and many local residents and businesses supported the designation at the time. The Tuscarora Township Board and Downtown Development Authority have expressed interesting in paying for the necessary signage should MDOT and the CCRC move forward {{to apply for the}} designation from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials. The township board has passed a resolution in support of the BL I-75 designation.|$|E
50|$|During the off-season, the pit {{area was}} <b>repaved.</b> The {{individual}} pit boxes were changed to concrete, while {{the entrance and}} exit lanes were widened and <b>repaved</b> in asphalt.|$|R
50|$|The {{surface was}} <b>repaved</b> twice.|$|R
25|$|Additional {{improvements}} to the street were made throughout the 19th century: The avenue was macadamized in 1832 (and the poplars removed), <b>repaved</b> with round stones in 1852, and <b>repaved</b> with wooden blocks from 1st to 15th Streets in 1870. The wooden blocks required such extensive repair, however, that between 1876 and 1877 they were replaced with rock from 1st to 6th Streets NW, and with grahamite asphalt from 6th to 15th Streets NW. The avenue was <b>repaved</b> in 1890 and again in 1907.|$|R
5|$|Congregational {{prayers were}} {{reestablished}} at al-Azhar during the Mamluk Sultanate by Sultan Baibars in 1266. While Shāfi‘ī teachings, which Saladin and the Ayyubids followed, stipulated {{that only one}} mosque should {{be used as a}} congregational mosque in a community, the Hanafi madh'hab, to which the Mamluks adhered, placed no such restriction. Al-Azhar had by now lost its association with the Fatimids and Ismāʿīli doctrines, and with Cairo's rapid expansion, the need for mosque space allowed Baibars to disregard al-Azhar's history and restore the mosque to its former prominence. Under Baibars and the Mamluk Sultanate, al-Azhar saw the return of stipends for students and teachers, as well as the onset of work to repair the mosque, which had been neglected for nearly 100 years. According to al-Mufaddal, the emir 'Izz al-Din Aydamur al-Hilli built his house next to the mosque and while doing so repaired the mosque. Al-Maqrizi reports that the emir repaired the walls and roof as well as <b>repaving</b> and providing new floor mats. The first khutbah since the reign of the Fatimid caliph al-Hakim took place on January 16, 1266 with the sermon delivered on a new pulpit completed five days earlier.|$|E
5|$|The HAT under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary to subsidize basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, the HAT completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, the HAT built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, <b>repaving</b> of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E

25|$|A {{full-scale}} renovation {{plan was}} announced in September 2011. The 10-year program will include <b>repaving</b> the streets that separate the property's buildings, bulkhead renovation to the buildings that line the waterfront, installation of overhead power distribution and buss ducts, and a complete modernization of the property's 150 elevators.|$|E
25|$|Between 1946 and 1954 transbay fares {{increased}} from 20¢ to 50¢. Fares {{in this period}} were used to operate and for 'motorisation' which included streetcar track removal, <b>repaving,</b> purchase of new buses {{and the construction of}} bus maintenance facilities. Transbay ridership fell from 22.2 million in 1946 to 9.8 million in 1952.|$|E
50|$|Most {{roads in}} the area have not since been <b>repaved.</b>|$|R
50|$|The I-10/I-12/I-59 split, {{notorious for}} rough pavement, was <b>repaved</b> in 2015.|$|R
50|$|The {{track was}} <b>repaved</b> {{in the fall}} of 1995. Following the 1996 Brickyard 400, the apexes of the four turns were {{breaking}} up. Over the offseason, track crews <b>repaved</b> the apexes of the turns with a different compound of asphalt. The result was a better surface, but a visibly darker area in the apexes of all four turns.|$|R
25|$|It is {{not unusual}} for small {{sections}} of the parkway to be temporarily closed to repair damage caused by the cold winter climate of the mountains or for other maintenance. Detours caused by these closures are well-marked, and are arranged to cause as little disruption as possible, though maintenance such as <b>repaving</b> only warrants a stop/slow switch with a one-lane only restriction.|$|E
25|$|The main {{business}} section of Castro St from Market to 19th street were under reconstruction and <b>repaving</b> in 2014 {{to address a}} number of neighborhood concerns. The area has heavy vehicular traffic {{as well as many}} visitors. As part of the work the sidewalks were widened and new trees were planted. Additionally 20 historical cement etchings covering from the inception to the area being settled to the 2010s sweeping gay marriage movement victories will be installed in September 2014.|$|E
25|$|At {{a cost of}} $197 million, new {{parallel}} two-lane trestles {{were built}} both to alleviate traffic and for safety reasons. Immediately after completion of the parallel trestles, traffic was diverted to them and the original trestles and roadway underwent a $20 million retrofit, repairing {{the wear and tear}} of 35 years of service and upgrading certain features, such as <b>repaving</b> the road surface. The older portion of the facility was then reopened on April 19, 1999.|$|E
50|$|In 1990, Prešeren Square was <b>repaved,</b> and the {{fountain}} extensively restored and renovated.|$|R

25|$|Plans for {{investment}} and regeneration had begun before the poll, with local amenity group the Streatham Society leading a successful partnership bid for funding from central government for environmental improvements. Work started in winter 2003-04 with the refurbishment of Streatham Green and <b>repaving</b> and relighting of the High Road between St Leonard's Church and the Odeon Cinema. In 2005 Streatham Green won the Metropolitan Public Gardens Association 'London Spade' {{award for best}} public open space scheme in the capital.|$|E
25|$|With loss of its strategic/defensive {{role and}} growth in {{economic}} development, many builders {{looked to the}} unused walls as potential building material. From the 19th century on, the castle became a source of stone, helping to pave new streets and building houses. The walls of the castle were lowered by half a meter, {{in order to support}} the <b>repaving</b> of the city streets. Between 1874 and 1884, various parts of the walls were knocked down in order to construct buildings in the town.|$|E
25|$|The {{final result}} {{will include the}} <b>repaving</b> of 4th Avenue and the {{reduction}} of lanes from four to two—one lane in each direction with left-turn lanes at each intersection—and the addition of bike lanes from Hal Greer Boulevard to 6th Street; on-street parking will not be affected. New trees and street lights, similar to what was installed along 3rd Avenue near Pullman Square and along 9th Street, will be installed along 4th Avenue. Other safety improvement projects and traffic calming features, such as the replacing of sidewalks and curb extensions, will enhance pedestrian safety.|$|E

25|$|Bienvenüe's project {{consisted}} of 10 lines, which correspond to today's lines 1 to9. Construction {{was so intense}} that by 1920, despite a few changes from schedule, most lines had been completed. The shield method of construction was rejected {{in favor of the}} cut-and-cover method in order to speed up work. Bienvenüe, a highly regarded engineer, designed a special procedure of building the tunnels to allow the swift <b>repaving</b> of roads, and is credited with a largely swift and relatively uneventful construction through the difficult and heterogeneous soils and rocks.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{original}} parkway was surfaced in reinforced concrete. Officials favored it despite its higher initial cost as compared to asphalt since it was less likely to need repair over its 50-year lifespan and reflected more light at night, improving safety. When the parkway reached Columbia County, asphalt was used instead due to its lower cost by that time. Asphalt was also used for <b>repaving</b> of segments to the south; today {{the original}} concrete remains only between the US44 and northern NY82 exits. From that point to the parkway's northern terminus, the asphalt is original.|$|E
25|$|On 1 June 1992, the {{property}} became {{the responsibility of}} the Instituto Português do Património Arquitetónico (Portuguese Institute for Architectural Patrimony), by decree law 106F/92 (Diário da República, Série 1A, 126). From 1999 the IPPAR began refurbishing and upkeep on the castle, including requalifying the zone around the castle, with <b>repaving,</b> the addition of stone bunks along the south wall, exterior illumination, resurfacing the roadway to the castle, installation of metal rails for the staircase, cleaning of the cistern and correcting irregularities in the structure. Similar projects were carried out in 2000 (such as weather treatment, consolidation of tower and ceilings), while excavations were carried out within the structure beginning in 2001.|$|E

50|$|Between 2001 and 2002, the track, {{after the}} {{reconfiguration}} in 1998, was <b>repaved</b> {{because of a}} hole in turn three. On August 17, 2010, a press conference was held and {{it was announced that}} TMS's spring race will become a Saturday night event in 2011. The Samsung Mobile 500 was held on Saturday April 9, 2011. The same year, the apron of the speedway was <b>repaved.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the summer}} of 1976, the entire track was <b>repaved</b> in asphalt. It {{marked the first time}} since the bricks were laid in the fall of 1909 that the Indianapolis Motor Speedway was <b>repaved</b> in its entirety. The surface was allowed to cure over the winter, and during a tire test in March, Gordon Johncock ran a lap of 200.401 mph, an {{unofficial}} track record.|$|R
