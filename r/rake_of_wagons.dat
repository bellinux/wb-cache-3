50|$|As the {{standard}} BR general-purpose diesel shunter, the class became a familiar sight at major stations and freight yards. Since their introduction, though, {{the nature of}} rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly fixed <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons,</b> and passenger trains are mostly multiple units, neither requiring {{the attention of a}} shunting locomotive. Consequently, {{a large proportion of the}} class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored, scrapped, exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.|$|R

5000|$|Steam Locomotives used on {{the line}} were mainly {{restricted}} to the lightweight U and Q class along with smaller tank locomotives such as Wa, Wf, F and D classes. The reason being the only turning facilities at Bluff was the [...] "Wye" [...] layout {{that was part of}} the wharf's lighter rail access bridges. Only the tank locomotives could use the wharf trackage and they were assisted by a capstan winch system that could pull wagons into position under ship's cranes, Bluff town wharf never having cranes. The small shunters would also assist with handling <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> to and from the Ocean Beach freezing works.|$|R

50|$|Following the {{handover}} {{of operations}} of the SMR to the State Rail Authority, the 10 class remained in service on the truncated J&A Brown railway between Stockrington and Hexham. As steam on all State Government systems in Australia had ended in the 1970s, {{this was the last}} commercial steam train operation in Australia, attracting much media attention. In September 1987, Coal & Allied announced that the line would soon close, with all coal haulage going to road. The last remained crews at Hexham protested and blockaded the entrance to the loader, using 30 and a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons.</b> After a long standoff, during which the men were sacked and stripped of their entitlements, 30 hauled the last loaded coal train from Stockrington loader to Hexham Washery, and later 25, on 22 September 1987, hauled the last revenue steam-hauled train in Australia, a string of empties to be stored at Hexham.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{train was}} a special rail train {{comprising}} five [...] "salmon" [...] wagons loaded with 300 ft lengths of continuous welded rail, two brake vans and a seven-wagon fitted head (a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> fitted with vacuum brakes), which had departed from [...] Down Siding West at 20:12. This was some two hours later than scheduled because the driver had had to collect the fitted head from Tonbridge. The train was restricted to a maximum speed of 25 mph. The second train was the 19:18 [...] to [...] parcels train, hauled by Class 33/0 diesel-electric locomotive D6558 and comprising a 4-wheel refrigerated van, two 4-wheel parcels vans, four bogie parcels vans and a 4-wheel Covered Carriage Truck. This train was running eight minutes behind the rail train. It was scheduled to pass Paddock Wood 20 minutes before the third train, and arrive at Ashford 18½ minutes before the third train. The third train was the 20:00 [...] to [...] passenger train, comprising two 4CEP electric multiple units, Nos. 7181 and 7117.|$|E
50|$|British and European {{locomotives}} of {{this type}} tend to be {{much smaller than the}} common size in the United States. Current British shunters are 0-6-0 diesel-electrics, Class 08 and Class 09, of 350-400 horsepower. These were developed from similar locomotives supplied by the English Electric Company to the Big Four British railway companies in the 1930s and 1940s, e.g. those pioneered by the LMS. Similar locomotives were exported to the Netherlands (e.g. NS Class 600) and Australia (e.g. Victorian Railways F class (diesel)). The use of shunting locomotives saw a sharp decline in Britain {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, largely due to the contraction of the network, increased competition from road traffic and widespread adoption of train-load freight, with fixed <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> moving mainly bulk products between rapid-loading facilities, as opposed to thousands of sidings and goods depots feeding trains <b>of</b> assorted <b>wagons</b> into the marshalling yards.|$|R
5000|$|GOC Workshop {{is awarded}} with new orders from Railway Board for {{manufacturing}} 600 Nos <b>of</b> BOXNHL <b>wagon,</b> {{which is a}} Stainless Steel wagon with High pay load (71 tonnes against 68 tonnes in normal wagons) designed to overcome the problems of corrosion, body bulging and weak stanchions in the existing wagons. The new design enables to an extra loading of 2.92 tonnes per wagon and 169 tonnes per <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 58 <b>wagons</b> which contributes an extra earning <b>of</b> Rs.5800 per <b>wagon</b> and Rs. 3.38 Lakhs per rake.

5000|$|Freight trains {{formerly}} used a goods line to {{the west}} to bypass the station, but this was closed in 1984 after a runaway <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> container <b>wagons</b> derailed at high speed on the River Caldew bridge at Dentonholme, damaging it beyond economic repair. [...] Nearly all freight services (apart from those running directly from the Cumbrian Coast Line toward the Tyne Valley Line or the Settle-Carlisle Line, or vice versa) now have {{to use one of}} the main platform lines when passing through the station, which can cause congestion at peak times.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1870s the Dorking Greystone Lime Co. of Betchworth, Surrey, decided {{there was a}} need for steam {{locomotives}} to work the horse drawn narrow gauge lines in their quarry. Following on from the success of their 1877 standard gauge Fletcher Jennings 0-4-0T No. 3 (later named Captain Baxter, now preserved at the Bluebell Railway, they decided on Fletcher Jennings products again. Two new engines, works nos. 172L and 173L (later becoming Townsend Hook and William Finlay respectively) were built in early 1880 at Fletcher Jennings' Lowca Works and dispatched to Betchworth by rail. The locos had some issues, such as the wooden brake blocks catching fire due to the friction caused by braking the heavy loads of chalk. This was remedied by fitting of metal brake blocks on both engines. In time other modifications took place such as replacing the original Friedman injectors mounted underneath the cab with new Penberthy injectors mounted on the tanks tops; and also the addition of cabs. Townsend Hooks boiler was replaced in 1897 with William Finlays being replaced in 1922. In 1937 Townsend Hook was hit side on by a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>wagons</b> descending under gravity, knocking it eight feet down a ledge, dislodging the safety valves and enveloping the loco in steam. Fortunately the damage was not too extensive and Townsend Hook was quickly repaired. Townsend Hook was eventually withdrawn in 1952 with a broken axle bearing and was placed into storage.|$|E
5000|$|The new railway {{followed}} the general {{route of the}} Slate Road from the highlands of The Braich northwest to near the coast, where it swung west to approach the creek on its northern side. All traffic was horse-drawn, with stables at Allt-Ddu, {{at the foot of}} the Craig Llwyd incline, at [...] "Stablau Newydd" [...] where the line came near the Slate Road and at the head of the Garth Incline. Port horses and manpower were used at the port itself. Between inclines the route was either level or favoured loads, though it was never [...] "gravity worked". The inclines were [...] "balanced" [...] and [...] "self-acting, i.e. the extra weight <b>of</b> a descending <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> loaded <b>wagons</b> lifted a corresponding <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> empties, with the rope, cable or chain passing round a braked drum to enable staff to maintain control.|$|R
50|$|At Stairfoot in South Yorkshire on 12 December 1870, a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> runaway goods <b>wagons</b> {{collided}} with a passenger train resulting in 15 deaths and 59 injuries. In his report into the accident, Rich found that the goods guard at Barnsley was gravely at fault for not ensuring the standing wagons were better secured. The layout of the yard was also criticized as there were no trap points to protect the running lines {{in the event of}} such a mishap.|$|R
50|$|On 4 August 1976, 56 001 and 56 002 {{were loaded}} for {{shipping}} from Zeebrugge to Harwich. They were towed from Harwich to Tinsley on 7 August. Initial trials {{were conducted on}} the Settle-Carlisle Line.Subsequent examples (of the Romanian deliveries) went to Barrow Hill depot for preparation and subsequent commissioning on test trains from Tinsley, usually to Peterborough West Yard. The test train consisted <b>of</b> a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> rail-carrying flat <b>wagons,</b> with a former East Coast Metro-Cammell Pullman vehicle marshalled immediately behind the locomotive. Testing of Doncaster-built examples was completed using the traditional Doncaster works test train, running north along the East Coast Main Line.|$|R
50|$|On 12 September 1870 in Barnsley top yard a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 10 goods <b>wagons</b> was {{standing}} on a gradient of 1 in 119. A single sprag between the spokes of a wheel was holding them. When two gas tank wagons were shunted against the rake, the sprag broke and the 12 wagons began to move. Two pointsmen made valiant efforts to pin down the brakes to no avail. The wagons rapidly gathered speed as the gradient increased to 1 in 72 and passed three signal boxes, none of which had points under their control to deflect the runaways. Meanwhile, a passenger train which had left Barnsley at 18:15 {{was standing}} at Stairfoot station {{one and a half}} miles away. The runaways struck the rear of the standing train at a speed of at least 40 mph, killing 15 and injuring 59 more.|$|R
40|$|Derailments are a {{significant}} cost to the Australian sugar industry with damage to rail infrastructure and rolling stock in excess of $ 2 M per annum. Many factors can contribute to cane rail derailments. The more prevalent factors are discussed. Derailment statistics on likely causes for cane rail derailments are presented with the case <b>of</b> empty <b>wagons</b> on the main line being the highest contributor to business cost. Historically, the lateral to vertical wheel load ratio, termed the derailment ratio, {{has been used to}} indicate the derailment probability of rolling stock. When the derailment ratio reaches the Nadal limit of 0. 81 for cane rail operations, there is a high probability that a derailment will occur. Contributing factors for derailments include the operating forces, the geometric variables of the rolling stock and the geometric deviations of the railway track. These combined, have the capacity to affect the risk of derailment for a cane rail transport operating system. The derailment type that is responsible for creating the most damage to assets and creating mill stops is the flange climb derailment, as these derailments usually occur at speed with a full <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> empty <b>wagons.</b> The typical forces that contribute to the flange climb derailment case for cane rail operations are analysed and a practical derailment model is developed to enable operators to better appreciate the most significant contributing factors to this type of derailment. The paper aims to: (a) improve awareness of the significance of physical operating parameters so that these principles can be included in locomotive driver training and (b) improve awareness <b>of</b> track and <b>wagon</b> variables related to the risk of derailment so that maintainers of the rail system can allocate funds for maintenance more effectively...|$|R
500|$|On the moors, when dried turves {{were ready}} to be collected, {{temporary}} track sections were laid {{at right angles to}} the main line, and a portable turntable was installed. A <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> twelve <b>wagons</b> could then be moved onto the temporary track, one at a time, to be filled by a 'filling gang'. Each wagon held about a ton, and once all twelve had been manoeuvred over the turntable back onto the main line, they would be pulled to the works by horses. With the advent of the small Lister engines, a new system was used, where three curved sections of track were used, the end one being clipped onto the top of the main line track. The engines could then push a line of forty or fifty wagons onto the temporary track. Cutting of the peat was mechanised from 1963, with the introduction of German peat-cutting machines, and by 1970, all hand cutting had ceased. Loading of the turves into wagons was also initially by hand, but gradually 'sod collectors' were introduced, which at Swinefleet had a [...] conveyor and at Hatfield a [...] one. These enabled a single side track to serve a much wider section of moor, without having to move the track. Loading turves onto the start of the conveyor was still done manually, but it became difficult to find people who wanted to do the work, and so Hymac loaders were used to load peat directly into the <b>wagons.</b> The success <b>of</b> this process at Hatfield in 1981 lead to it being used at Swinefleet as well.|$|R
50|$|Side Rake {{along with}} back rake {{controls}} the chip flow and partly counteracts {{the resistance of}} the work to the movement of the cutter and can be optimized to suit the particular material being cut. Brass for example requires a back and side <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 0 degrees while aluminum uses a back <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 35 degrees and a side <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> 15 degrees.|$|R
50|$|On 17 August 1956. a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> {{carriages}} {{ran away}} and collided with another <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> carriages and a parcels van. The van was {{pushed into the}} parcels office, bringing down its roof, which crushed two cars.|$|R
2500|$|The level 9 adit was {{the longest}} built at Rhosydd, {{measuring}} [...] from the mouth to the haulage system at the inner end. It had a gradient of 1 in 86 to aid drainage, and took eight years to complete, being completed in 1870 or 1871. During its construction, an internal incline was built downwards from floor 5, so that rock from higher levels could be lowered down to the mine exit. Trucks were moved along the adit by attaching them to an endless rope, which was driven by a [...] diameter pitchback water wheel located {{near the mouth of}} the adit. They were marshalled into <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> about 12 <b>wagons,</b> with a gripper truck or megryn at both ends. A screw handle was used to attach the front megryn to the rope, both on the line of full trucks in the mine and on empty ones outside the adit. The rope was then set in motion, and when the couplings between the trucks were tight, the gripper on the back megryn was applied. When they reached the far end, the grippers were released, as the water wheel took some time to stop. A similar system was used on the Glasgow Subway when it first opened. For most of its length, there were only three rails in the adit, the centre one being shared by both tracks. They fanned out into double tracks at both ends, and for [...] in the middle, so that trucks moving in opposite directions could pass one another. Communication between the operators at either end was by a bell system.|$|R
