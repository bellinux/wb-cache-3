40|$|The {{current study}} used a person-oriented {{approach}} {{to examine the}} participation of adolescents in both constructive, organized activities as well as <b>relaxed</b> <b>leisure</b> activities. The goal {{of this research was}} to identify different profiles of involvement in activities and the relations to psychosocial indicators for these differing groups. Activity profiles were created using cluster analytic techniques for 918 adolescents' responses in 11 activity domains. The groups were found to be both statistically and substantively unique and consistent with findings from previous research. Further, the groups showed meaningful and consistent differences across a range of psychosocial indicators, including academic performance, problem behavior, and mental health. Results indicated that adolescents' activity involvement was related to their psychological and behavioral functioning and that the profiles of participation across activity settings provide a more holistic view of teens' choices than do single variable models...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} a mundane activity {{that can be}} characterized as both hard (physical) work and ‘play’ of a certain kind, in that it can be undertaken as a pleasurable, playful and <b>relaxing</b> <b>leisure</b> activity. For us as ‘veteran’ runners, apart from {{in the early days of}} our youthful running biographies, when first introduced to running as a ‘fun’ leisure activity, running constitutes an activity we define as mundane, but ‘serious leisure’ (Stebbins 1993, 2011), immersing us in a culture of commitment in leisure (Tomlinson 1993). We briefly describe below our running biographies in order to situate the ethnomethodological analysis of our ‘running-together‘ as a crafted co-production, accomplished on a quasi daily basis over many years. Whilst running is therefore defined as a ‘serious‘ activity for us, it also constitutes outdoors ‘play‘ when juxtaposed against the long hours of arduous ‘headwork‘ indoors, as required by our paid jobs as academics. In order to address our topic of running-together (specifically in training, rather than in racing), this chapter is structured as follows. We first examine the general theoretical framework of ethnomethodology, and consider the literature that utilises an ethnomethodological approach to sports and physical activity participation, as this body of work relates more directly to our own lived experience of running than does literature examining other forms of ‘play‘, such as the game of chequers/checkers (Livingston 2006), for example. We then proceed to describe briefly the collaborative autoethnographical/autophenomenographical research project from which our illustrative data are drawn, before portraying these data via an ethnomethodological analytic lens...|$|R

40|$|Young peoples {{experience}} of boredom and/or depression is often reported {{as a negative}} factor that influences their health. Although leisure {{has a number of}} psychological benefits that have the potential to assist young people to cope with their negative mood states, there has been little research to investigate how these benefits are utilised in their daily life. From this perspective, this study explored the role that leisure plays in relieving boredom and depression of young adults and how their health status is linked to the leisure behaviours. The question of how leisure involves young adults when they attempt to relieve a bored and/or depressed mood state was firstly explored through focus group interviews. Secondly, a questionnaire survey was conducted using a total of 433 university students to investigate the different characteristics associated with their leisure behaviours and to determine their relationships with health related variables. Other related leisure and psychological variables were tested to search for the positive factors that contributed to their healthy leisure participation and to provide relief from their boredom and/or depression states. The results demonstrated that the high frequency types of leisure that young adults participated in to relieve a bored or depressed mood state were casual, unstructured or passive home types of leisure such as listening to music, watching TV, surfing the Internet, going out with friends, eating, doing nothing, or sleeping. Other positive leisure types were also identified in the middle ranking of choice. These included sports and physical activities, outdoor activities, travel, creative activities, housework and school related reading. In addition, other types of risky health leisure involvement such as drinking, smoking, and/or drug use were identified at a lower ranking. Factor analysis further demonstrated that there were eight boredom relief leisure types  active &# 8901; social, work related, creative, sports &# 8901; physical, outdoor travel, casual, passive technology and passive home leisure. Similarly, eight depression relief leisure types were also identified - active &# 8901; social, work related, sports &# 8901; physical, creative, outdoor travel, relaxing, deviant and passive technology leisure. Similarities as well as differences were found between young adults boredom and depression relief leisure behaviour, while gender differences were identified in both boredom and depression relief leisure behaviour. Significant relationships were verified between young adults leisure behaviour that was engaged in to relieve a bored and/or depressed mood state and their health. Positive, active or healthy leisure behaviour engaged in to relieve boredom or depression (e. g., active &# 8901; social, work related, creative, sports &# 8901; physical, or outdoor travel leisure participation) was found to positively influence health. On the other hand, comparatively negative, passive or unhealthy types of leisure behaviour engaged in to relieve a bored and/or depressed mood state (e. g., passive home, passive technology, deviant, or <b>relaxing</b> <b>leisure)</b> were found to {{have a negative impact on}} a young persons health. Leisure awareness was identified as a significant positive factor for wise leisure behaviour in relieving boredom and/or depression. Practical leisure awareness (leisure skills or wise leisure participation) had a stronger impact than the cognitive or attitudinal variables (knowledge of leisure or leisure attitudes). The leisure behaviour that was engaged in to relieve boredom and/or depression also had a significant relationship with several psychological variables. Positive or healthy types of leisure behaviour used to relieve boredom or depression were positively related to higher negative mood regulation and a lower level of experiencing boredom or depression. Empirical models of leisure, health and psychological variables were developed in which the levels of impact of each study variable on health variables were demonstrated. Leisure awareness was found to have a stronger impact than other variables on both psychological wellbeing and perceived health. Negative or unhealthy boredom or depression relief leisure behaviour factors such as passive home, passive technology, deviant or <b>relaxing</b> <b>leisure</b> were found to have a stronger negative impact on both psychological wellbeing and perceived health than others. However, sports &# 8901; physical boredom or depression relief leisure behaviour factor had a stronger positive impact on perceived health. Young adults leisure styles that are engaged in to relieve a bored or depressed mood state were also explored. Five boredom relief leisure styles were identified as creative, work related, multiple, active and passive and four depression relief leisure styles identified as inactive, deviant, work related and active.  Significant differences in leisure, health and psychological variables were demonstrated according to different leisure involvement styles...|$|R

40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} prevalence, phenomenology, and {{background}} of leisure sickness, i. e., {{the condition of}} people developing symptoms of sickness during weekends and/or vacations. Method: In order to obtain an estimate of its prevalence, a representative Dutch sample consisting of 1, 128 men and 765 women was asked to indicate to what extent they recognized themselves in our description of weekend and vacation sickness. For {{the investigation of the}} phenomenology and background of this condition and the characteristics of the patients suffering from it, questionnaire data were collected in new samples consisting of 114 cases and 56 controls. Questions referred to symptoms, onset, duration, appreciation of weekend and vacation activities, and appraisal of work and workload. Results: In the case of male respondents, 3. 6 and 3. 2 % recognized themselves in the description of the weekend and the vacation syndrome, respectively, compared with 2. 7 and 3. 2 % women. Most frequently reported symptoms were headache/migraine, fatigue, muscular pains, and nausea. In addition, viral infections (flue-like, common cold) were often reported in relation to vacations. Cases had generally suffered from leisure sickness for over 10 years and the onset was associated with stressful conditions. They attributed their condition to difficulties with the transition from work to nonwork, stress associated with travel and vacation, as well as workload and personality characteristics. There were no significant group differences in the appreciation of weekend and leisure activities or lifestyle during days off. Most striking differences were found with respect to experienced workload, sense of responsibility, and inability to <b>relax.</b> Conclusion: <b>Leisure</b> sickness is a relatively common condition. Specific lifestyle factors or leisure activities seem to be less relevant for its development. Concerning risk factors, the data tend to point to high workload and person characteristics, namely, the inability to adapt to the nonworking situation, a high need for achievement, and a high sense of responsibility with respect to work. Future studies should be designed for testing specific hypotheses concerning the underlying mechanisms and evaluating the effectiveness of psychological and/or physical activity interventions. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{considerable}} number young {{of students are}} suffering from sociopsychological complaints. The psychological complaints emerge from differnt sources. Important factors for psychological well being are experiences of a satisfactory social network, efficient coping strategies and a supportive school climate. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine how young girls in the age of 16 - 18 years old experience and cope with demands from school. To fulfill the aim of this study we have five questions: What do the girls apprehend as a satisfactory/unsatisfactory working environment? How do the girls define stress? How do the girls cope with stress? What importance has leisure time? What importance has the social network?   The method we used for this study was qualitative and the material was collected through four focus groups. Fourteen girls were interviewed from four different school classes with different profiles. The theoretical framework used to analyze the findings consisted of the demand-control-model created by Karasek & Theorell, Antonovsky’s KASAM theory and Selyes GAS-theory.   Stress expressed by the girls in this study is described as an unbalance between workload and available time. The analysis shows that most of the girls in the study experience school as a demanding setting that create strain. Furthermore, the results indicate that experienced demands not only originate from school but also from the girls themselves and by comparison with classmates. A satisfactory school environment is described as possibilities to influence the school work and the structrue of courses. Also a good relationship with teachers as well as classmates where pointed out as important factors. Strategies the girls use to cope with stress and demands are structuration, priority and planning. Some of the girls also think that a positive attitude towards life, regular eating and sleeping are important factors in coping with stress. All the girls describs leisure time as significant.   Most girls practice sport activites but activities as playing instrument, watching movies and spending time with peers is also mentioned. All of the girls find their leisure time as of importance for them to relax and revive from the strain caused by school. However, some girls find it hard to fully <b>relax</b> during <b>leisure</b> activites and also think that time for leisure is too limited. The social network is aslo seen as an important instrument in coping with strain. Most of the girls in this study do talk to family or friends in times of hardship...|$|R
40|$|International audienceEcosystem {{services}} (ES) {{concept is}} now {{used by many}} researchers. But some questions remain, especially on generalizability and mapping of results. Which method using? Some researchers suggest basing ES mapping on landscapes knowledge but, in fact, they only use land use map: a given ES is associated to a land use category. This is feasible for provisioning services but what about cultural services (CES) ? This proposal intends to question this methodological point, in really different contexts, based on two researches. The one is about French urban green spaces (UGS), studied {{in the framework of}} a research project. The other one focused on sylvosystems of a Vietnamese rural area, in a PhD framework. In two cases, interviews were conducted, with users and managers of UGS, with Vietnamese villagers – completed by archives consultation. In France, the interviewees consider UGS as a source of well-being and consider them as <b>leisure,</b> <b>relaxing</b> or meeting areas. We distinguished different UGS: forest or semi-natural, ornamental and allotment gardens. We could think that ES could be associated to each one and thus mapping ES from UGS map. But the association is not so easy. Moreover, urban dwellers can consider a given category of urban nature sometimes as CES source, sometimes as disservices source. Generalizing the results is thus difficult and this compromises CES mapping. In Việt Nam, CES associated to sylvosystems also differ, here especially according to ethnic belonging of interviewees. Some consider forest as sacred, others with repulsion. The map could be based on localization of ethnic groups (to be considered for landscapes mapping). But, the sacred nature is not attached to all forests, depending on beliefs. Moreover, these CES varied also over time. The link between landscapes and ES is heuristic, because these concepts question the interrelations Man-Nature, in an interdisciplinary way. But, as it’s difficult to include the various assessments of landscapes, it’s difficult to generalize CES and thus to map them...|$|R

When I replied that I had read none in Latin, though several in Greek, that revered man poured forth in the following words the sorrow that his groan implied: [...] "Shall the Deified Aurelian, that most famous of princes, that most firm of rulers, who restored the whole world to the sway of Rome, be unknown to posterity? God prevent such madness! And yet, if I am not mistaken, we possess the written journal of that great man and also his wars recorded in detail in the manner of a history, and these I should like you to procure and set forth in order, adding thereto all that pertains to his life. All these things you may learn in your zeal for research from the linen books, for he gave instructions that in these all that he did each day should be written down.
