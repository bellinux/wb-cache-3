40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} to study changes caused by irradiation or high hydrostatic pressure pasteurization of liquid egg white by differential scanning calorimetry, spectrofluorimetry, electronic nose measurements and NIR-spectrometry. The non-thermal pasteurization treatments were also assessed in relation to loss of carotenoid content, and lipid- and cholesterol oxidation of liquid egg yolk. Unlike <b>radiation</b> <b>pasteurization,</b> high pressure processing caused protein denaturation in egg white, which manifested in changes of its DSC-thermogram and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Electronic nose testing showed changes of the head-space volatile composition of egg albumen, particularly {{as a function of}} radiation treatment. Both treatments caused changes in the NIR-spectrometric “fingerprint” of the liquid egg white. Various chemometric analyses {{of the results of the}} latter instrumental methods, particularly statistical techniques developed by the group of one of the co-authors of this article, demonstrated the potential for detection and characterization of the applied non-thermal processing techniques on liquid egg white. Irradiation induced more carotenoid degradation and lipid oxidation in liquid egg yolk than pressure processing...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{pasteurization}} being a borderline process, it was {{attempted to}} use ionizing radiation for rendering whole egg, intended for preservation by other methods than freezing, free from Salmonelleae. Initial densities of about 107 /ml of S. typhimurium and S. senftenberg were used. Irradiation {{was carried out}} with a ca. 1500 c Co 60 -source, the inoculated whole egg being packed in lacquered tins and kept at ca. 1 °C during this treatment. Six decimal reductions of the Salmonella-species tested were obtained at dosages of 2 × 105 rad, nine reductions at slightly over 5 × 105 rad. No effect {{of the use of}} specific recovery media or pre-treatments on the apparent dose value required for obtaining these reductions could be established. The odour of the whole egg and its functional properties appeared to have been impaired at dosages of 104 rad, while the colour suffered from ca. 2 × 105 rad. Therefore, the <b>radiation</b> <b>pasteurization</b> of liquid whole egg at ca. 1 °c cannot be considered a promising process...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 <b>Pasteurization</b> <b>radiation</b> {{offers a}} new means of {{extending}} the refrigerated storage life of foods. This procedure avoids many of the undesirable changes which result when sterilization radiation is used and still eliminates most of the spoilage organisms. Shrimp was treated with 5 ppm chlortetracycline and subjected to pasteurization levels of gamma radiation and stored at 38 °F. The levels of irradiation used were 0. 5 and 0. 75 megarad. These levels {{were based on the}} flavor threshold of irradiation intensity. The quality of the stored irradiated shrimp was determined by subjective evaluation, chemical analyses and microbiological examinations. The storage life of the shrimp irradiated at 0. 5 megarad was extended to 5 weeks, compared with 1 week for the unirradiated samples held at the same temperature. Throughout the ten week storage period, the samples which received doses of 0. 5 megarad and CTC and those which received 0. 75 megarad with and without CTC remained in good condition...|$|R
40|$|That entire {{groups of}} ethnic people live healthfully and disease free to 120 years or longer is alarming, {{given the fact}} that life {{expectancy}} in the U. S. A. is only 76 years. (2) Imagine living to 120 WITHOUT sickness or disease, to walk upright in full health to the day of your passing. Awesome thought, isn't it? Americans typically die from estrogenic and disease-related health issues, not from old age. (3) The obvious question of why is answered in looking at how we live. Beyond the stress of life, environmental issues and lack of exercise, the one thing that separates longevity from early death is the quality of food we eat. Enzymes: The Standard American Diet (S. A. D.) consists mostly of processed foods, foods which have life-giving enzymes cooked out of them. Heating, <b>pasteurization,</b> <b>radiation</b> and micro waving destroy enzymes in food and liquids. (4) This causes vital parts of the body (heart, bones, organs, brain, blood, etc.) to lose enzyme benefits and consequently become inefficient, diseased, prematurely old, and finally, to become functional. Cultures long on longevity eat whole, unprocessed foods, foods rich in enzymes. Th...|$|R
40|$|From the {{beginning}} of time, the history of man has been his struggle to obtain food. After many thousands of years, {{this is still a}} major problem which confronts the peoples of the earth. Although much food is available on earth, a great deal never benefits mankind because of deterioration and spoilage. Various kinds of spoilage cause a million tons of grain to be wasted each year. Man has learned to control and overcome some of these destructive forced through a variety of methods of food preservation. Some forms of preservation such as drying, salting, and so forth, probably have been known since {{the beginning}} of civilization. The most ancient method of food preservation, drying, was copied from nature. Early man gathered dried fruits, berries, nuts, legumes, and grains which had matured and dried on the plants. Later they used their shelters to dry food, and pre-Columbus American Indians used the heat from their fires. However, it was not until about {{the latter part of the}} eighteenth century that a hot air dehydration room was used. Much of the drying done for modern consumers is in the form of dehydration, which means artificially dried. About the same time that dehydration came into being, Nicholas Appert began work on another process of preserving food, which came to be known as canning. He received an award from Napoleon when he proved that food heated in sealed containers would not spoil if the containers were not reopened or the seal was not broken. For half a century there was no correct explanation for the success of this process until Pasteur discovered that microscopic growth caused food to spoil. It then became clear that Appert had destroyed micro-organisms by heat, and excluded their re-entry by sealing the containers. The invention of a pressure steam retort, social legislation of the Food and Drug Act, use of the common 2 ̆ 2 sanitary 2 ̆ 2 tin can, and research devoted to the study of nutrients in relation to the canning process have all aided significantly in creating our modern canning industry. Desrosier (7) has aptly said that food preservation practices prior to the discovery of canning were copied from nature. Canning, which has no counterpart in nature, has changed the eating habits of the western world. Although freezing was used as a method of preserving foods for centuries, the invention of a successful refrigerator in the late 18002 ̆ 7 s marked {{the beginning of}} the vast field of the modern method of refrigeration and freezing. Fish was frozen commercially as early as 1880; meats, in 1891; fruits, in 1905; and vegetables, in 1929. However, int he 19302 ̆ 7 s when modern homes contained a refrigerator, frozen foods began to find their place in commerce. It was not until 1940 that freezing assumed its rightful place as a means of preservation. To preserve foods as nearly as possible in their natural state has long been an aim of man. Each method of preservation has obvious advantages, but not one has wholly accomplished this aim. If a method could be found that preserved food without marked change in its natural characteristics, it would mean man was close to achieving his goal. Fruits and vegetables, which are very perishable, make up 40 percent of the total food consumption. Twenty-five to 50 percent of the fruits and vegetables produced to be eaten fresh, spoil before they can be consumed (45). A new method of food preservation was made possible in 1945 when the Congress of the United States passed the Atomic Energy Act. Several divisions of the Atomic Energy Commission were concerned with the application of the peaceful uses of atomic energy. In 1953, considerable research on radiation preservation of food was started on a large scale. Subjecting food to ionizing radiation has been accepted by many as an effective means of preservation. Because of the many complex problems associated with radiation sterilization, preservation by this means is not as feasible at this time as that accomplished by the low doses of <b>radiation</b> for <b>pasteurization.</b> However, there are a number of areas in these low dose treatments which show great promise for use of radiation processing of foods. 1. Conservation of grain and certain packaged products by the destruction of insect infestation. 2. The inhibition of sprouting in potatoes and other root crops. 3. The destruction of trichinae in pork and pork products. 4. The inactivation of Salmonella in egg products. 5. The extension of shelf-life of fresh fruits and vegetables, cut meats, and fresh fish. The first four areas are approaching the stage at which commercial exploitation might be considered. However, considerable research must still be pursued toward the improvement of certain radiation-treated fresh foods in regard to wholesomeness, nutritive value, color, texture, flavor, and odor. The studies presented in this thesis were conducted on the acceptability and refrigerated-life of strawberries, and sweet cherries in relation to gamma radiation dose, variety and maturity of crops and physical changes...|$|R
40|$|Arabic bread {{prepared}} {{from local}} Saudi flour contained {{a total of}} up to 10 (4) organisms per g. Most of these were bacterial spores that survived the baking process (1. 3 X 10 (2) to 3. 5 X 10 (3] and {{a small number of}} yeasts and molds (10 to 40 cells per g). The organisms in Arabic bread appear to be harmless to healthy individuals. However, for immune system-compromised cancer patients and bone marrow transplant recipients, it is prudent to irradiate the bread to reduce microbial contamination. The decimal reduction doses (10 % survival) for the most radiation-resistant organisms (spore formers) in bread were 0. 11 to 0. 15 Mrad. Accordingly, 0. 6 Mrad was sufficient {{to reduce the number of}} spores in Arabic bread by a factor of 10, 000, i. e., to less than 1 /g. This treatment constitutes <b>radiation</b> <b>pasteurization</b> (radicidation), and to this extent, provides a margin of microbiological safety. Sensory evaluation by the nine-point hedonic scale showed no detectable loss of organoleptic quality of bread up to 0. 6 Mrad, while irradiation to 2. 5 Mrad induced unacceptable organoleptic changes...|$|E
