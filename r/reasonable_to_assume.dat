30|$|The peaks at 1373, 1329, and 898  cm− 1 {{were mainly}} due to carbohydrates, such as {{cellulose}} and hemicelluloses, {{but had no}} significant contribution from lignin. The intensities of these peaks were affected significantly by THM treatment. Reduction of the peak at 1373  cm− 1 {{is due to the}} formation of an ether linkage from hydroxyl groups within hemicelluloses and celluloses [29]. Another change observed was the slight reduction at 1329  cm− 1 for specimens according to the THM process. The previous results for the heat treatment of wood reported in the literature [21] show the appearance of a doublet at 1315 and 1335  cm− 1, characteristic of celluloses with a high-crystallized cellulose I content. The peak posited at 1329  cm− 1 is in the range of those at 1315 and 1335  cm− 1; it is <b>reasonable</b> <b>to</b> <b>assumed</b> that the both bands represent the high-crystallized cellulose. Therefore, it can be implied that crystallinity of the cellulose was affected due to heating or/and high pressure by the indication of reduction in the band at 1329  cm− 1. Moreover, the dropping of C–H peak at 898  cm− 1 under THM process with the increasing CR was mainly due to the degradation of hemicellulose. The absorption of water by wood depends on the hydrophilic nature of each cell wall component and the accessibility of water to the hydroxyl groups of polymers. Most of the hydroxyl sites in the hemicelluloses and lignin are accessible to moisture. Moreover, it is accessible for moisture with the amorphous cellulose (non-crystalline portion of cellulose) and the surfaces of the crystallites, but not with the crystalline section of cellulose. The increase of crystallinity proportion due to degradation of hemicelluloses and amorphous cellulose during THM treatment reduced the water wettability on THM wood.|$|R

An implicit assumption that all outcomes are equally likely underpins most randomization tools used in common games of chance (e.g. rolling dice, shuffling cards, spinning tops or wheels, drawing lots, etc.). Of course, players in such games can try to cheat by subtly introducing systematic deviations from equal likelihood (e.g. with marked cards, loaded or shaved dice, and other methods).|$|R
