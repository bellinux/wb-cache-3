2500|$|Most {{trade was}} [...] by barter. Paddy {{was the most}} {{commonly}} accepted medium of exchange, followed by purified salt. Honey and roots were exchanged for fish liver oil and arrack, while sugarcane and <b>rice</b> <b>flakes</b> were traded for venison and toddy. Poems in Purananuru describe the prosperous house in Pandya land [...] well stocked with paddy that the housewife had exchanged for grams and fish. Artisans and professionals traded their services for goods. Quantities were measured by weighing balance, called the Tulakkol named after Tulam, the standard weight. Delicate balances made of ivory were used by the goldsmiths for measures of Urai, Nali and Ma. A different kind of barter involving deferred exchange was known as Kuri edirppai [...] this involved taking a loan for a fixed quantity of a commodity to be repaid by the same quantity of the same commodity at a later date. Since barter was prevalent locally, coins were used almost exclusively for foreign trade.|$|E

50|$|Paralakhemundi is {{situated}} among the Eastern Ghats {{where there are}} vast plains and number of small streams and rivers. This has enabled cultivation as the chief source of income here. People cultivate mainly paddy, which is grown twice-a-year in the fields, once during Kharif and once during Rabi seasons. However many farmers also cultivate cash crops like Sugar Cane, Maize and Smoking Leaves. Some even cultivate long term cash crops like Mango Plantation, Cashew, Banana etc. The latest trend is that farmers are getting inclined to grow cotton in their fields, which apparently is more profitable to them. Apart from Cultivation and Industries related to cultivation like Rice Mills, Mango Pulp Factories, Cashew Factories, <b>Rice</b> <b>Flake</b> Industries, Sugar Mill, the town is poorly industrialized. However, some medium scale granite factories have been set-up in the surroundings of the town.The other source of income of the residents is through the Handicrafts that are made by them, which they are learning traditionally from generation to generation. The economy is sustainable but is not flourishing {{due to lack of}} industrialization and exposure to bigger markets. The backwardness in economy is chiefly due to the poor connectivity and lack of proper infrastructure available.|$|R

5000|$|It is {{now known}} that {{flavonoid}} and anthocyanin compounds {{are closely related to}} the antioxidation properties of black rice (Zhanget al[...], 2005). Oki et al. (2005) found that the DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radical scavenging activity is higher in red rices than in black and white rices, and that this activity is correlated with polyphenols and proanthocyanidin content. Considering that the highest scavenging activity due to the presence of polyphenols is in red rices than in black and white rices (Oki et al[...], 2005), red rices could once again find favour with health-conscious consumers. It is high time that people in India took a fresh look at similar properties in the vast pool of indigenous red rices.

A ultra high performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/TOFMS) method was developed and validated to screen {{for the presence of}} these mycotoxins in those cereal matrices. Matrix-matched calibration curves were used to compensate for ion suppression and extraction losses and the recovery values were in agreement with the minimum requirements of Regulation 401 / 2006 /EC (70 - 110 %). For most mycotoxins, the LODs obtained allowed detection in compliance with the maximum permitted levels set in Regulation EC/ 2006 / 1881, with the exception of OTA in all cereals and AFB 1 in yellow noodles. Extra target analysis of OTA in oat flakes and wheat noodles was performed by HPLC with fluorescence detection. High rates of contamination were observed in paddy rice (23 % DON, 23 % FB 1, 7 % AFB(1), 2 % AFG(1) and 2 % AFG(2)), white wheat noodles (33 % DON and 5 % OTA) and oat flakes (17 % DON, 2 % OTA and 2 % AFB(1)), whereas the rates of contamination were lower in polished rice (2 % AFG(1) and 4 % HT- 2 toxin) and yellow noodles (5 % DON). Low rates of co-occurrence of several mycotoxins were observed only for white wheat noodles (5 %) and paddy rice (7 %). White noodles were contaminated with DON and/or OTA, while combinations of AFG(1), AFB(1), DON and FB 1 were found in paddy rice.

Significant difference was observed in chemical and functional properties of ETFR with exception to water absorption index (WAI) and water solubility index (WSI). Optical parameters L∗, a∗ and b∗ values of EFTR were found to be 73. 72, 0. 39 and 9. 60, respectively significantly different from brown and roasted paddy.

The performance of the MIP throughout the clean-up of spiked bell pepper, <b>rice</b> and corn <b>flakes</b> sample extracts was compared with the results obtained when using non-imprinted polymer, C 18, strong anion exchange and immunoaffinity sorbents. Extracts were analysed for FB with LC-MS/MS after clean-up. Depending on the food matrix and the concentration range of the fumonisins, recoveries after MISPE varied from 62 to 86 %, 62 to 83 % and 67 to 81 % for fumonisin B 1 (FB 1), fumonisin B 2 (FB 2) and fumonisin B 3 (FB 3) respectively. Selectivity of the synthesized MIP for mycotoxins belonging to the group of FB was confirmed by evaluating cross-reactivity from analogue structures and other mycotoxins. Analysis of 39 naturally contaminated samples (corn flakes) by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that the synthesized MIP could be an excellent alternative for clean-up and preconcentration of FB in food samples. Pearson correlations between immunoaffinity clean-up and MISPE were calculated and amounted to 0. 923 for FB 1, 0. 808 for FB 2 and 0. 759 for FB 3.

40|$|A Phoma species, {{producing}} a squalestatin (Si) was grown on agar media derived from wheat, oats, {{oil seed rape}} and malt extract over a range of water availability values corresponding to water activity (aa) levels of. 0. 998, 0. 995, 0. 990, 0. 980 and 0. 960. Growth of the organism was not significantly affected by aw, except at the lowest value, but production of SI was significantly enhanced at intermediate aW in the range 0. 990 - 0. 980. For example, at 25 °C and 0. 98 aw wheat extract produced a l Ox increase in titre compared to 0. 998 aw at the same temperature. Wheat extract was shown {{to be the best}} substrate for SI production. For example, at 25 °C and 0. 98 aW, this substrate produced 2 x, 5 x and 8 x increases in titres compared to oat, malt and oil seed rape extracts respectively. A range of raw and processed agricultural products, including those used as extracts with the Phoma species, as well as maize, <b>rice,</b> soya, wheat <b>flakes,</b> bulgar wheat, couscous and "shredded wheat", were selected as candidate materials for solid substrate fermentation (SSF). Moisture sorption isotherms were prepared for each of these so that aW could be accurately set in experimental work. Small scale fermentations (40 cm 3 wet substrate volume) were carried out with these materials and the fungi Epicoccum nigrum, Sarophorum palmicola, Drechslera dematioidea and Corynespora cassiicola over the aw range 0. 998 - 0. 970. Studies with E. nigrum in particular produced a range of unique metabolites at low aw, and other metabolites where titres were increased by as much as 20 x compared to high aW conditions. The optimum aw level for metabolite production in this fungus appeared to be in the range 0. 990 - 0. 980. Ultimately, E. nigrum was chosen as the model fungus and bulgar wheat as the model substrate, with 3 key target metabolites being followed (metabolites 1, 2 and 3). A series of scale-up studies (40 cm 3 - 3 litres wet volume) were carried out utilising the model system. These studies typically produced reasonable levels of metabolites, but were subject to problematic water and heat accumulation, and bacterial contamination. These were identified as critical parameters. A system was ultimately developed around a Bioengineering AG submerged liquid fermenter, modified for use with solid substrates, and incorporating forced aeration and mechanical agitation. This apparatus gave encouraging levels of metabolites, producing most of these rapidly and uniformly, and showed good critical parameter control. The overall scale-up achieved in the final fermenter studies was 75 x, in terms of wet substrate volume. Increased titres were achieved for all three target metabolites compared to small-scale studies with the same substrate. These increases were approx. 17 x for metabolite 1, approx. 3 x for metabolite 3, while metabolite 2 was absent from small scale studies at the relevant aW level.
