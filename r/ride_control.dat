5|$|In 2013, it was {{announced}} that exports of the Commodore would resume to North America {{in the form of the}} VF Commodore as the Chevrolet SS sedan for the 2014 model year. The Chevrolet SS Sedan was imported to the United States (but again, not to Canada) again for 2015 with only minor changes, notably the addition of Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> suspension and a Tremec TR-6060 manual transmission. For the 2016 model year, the SS sedan received a facelift based on the VF Series II Commodore unveiled in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|Released in September 2009, the E Series 2 HSV GTS {{incorporated}} {{a more powerful}} motor and drivetrain than other HSV models. It retains the same GM LS3 6.2L V8 engine but {{while the rest of}} the HSV range still have 317kW or 425bhp, the GTS engine is rated at (325kW). Twin bonnet scoops have returned to this model from the styling of the Pontiac G8. Other changes include the availability of launch control on manual versions, a recalibrated version of the magnetic <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> suspension with stiffer springs for the HSV GTS, wider wheels and a new high-flow dual-mode muffler system that produces a throatier roar under heavy acceleration. The E-Series 2 stability control system also has a Competition setting which allows for more wheel slip for special track or motorsport applications. The cruise control brakes the car when it is travelling downhill to ensure its speed stays within one per cent of the set speed. This model has daytime running lights.|$|E
5|$|The E Series 3 was {{announced}} in September 2010. It carried the same motor and drivetrain as before, and only {{minor changes to the}} exterior. In this series HSV focused on changes to the interior of the car as well as major upgrades to the computer systems and a new electronic interface called the HSV Enhanced Driver Interface. External changes included the shock wave exhaust tips and grilles and new HID Xenon adaptive projector headlamps. The control panel changes included a new 'Oracle Dash' with upgraded trip computer, tire pressure monitors and fuel statistics; the center console was reworked, introducing the Holden touchscreen IQ system and the HSV EDI performance data logging system (similar to the Nissan GT-R), which displays real-time information on engine speed, brakes, gear shifts, g-forces on the car, steering angle, fuel economy, stability control, Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> suspension, car dynamics, Bi-Modal Exhaust, battery voltage, oil pressure, power, torque, elevation, exhaust pressure, intake manifold pressure and air intake temp. The system includes preloaded race track locations, stop watches and track maps, satellite navigation, digital radio, Bluetooth, optional DVD player and ability to download data onto a PC using the Motech i2 software. The E Series 3 introduced (SBZA) Side Blind Zone Alert which uses ultrasonic sensors to alert drivers of traffic obstructions in blind spots. Using the HSV EDI the driver can customize operation of the car by for example turning off stability control and controlling the Bi-Modal Exhaust. The E Series 3 offered the option of HSV LPI (Liquid Propane Injection), an LPG Autogas system which allows the use of liquid propane as an alternative fuel. The LPI is controlled by the car's ECU and seamlessly changes from petrol to LPG when the engine has reached optimum temperature (when maximum engine power is required, the system automatically switches back to petrol).|$|E

5000|$|The {{second section}} of each stage is a {{platformer}} section where the players fight through minor enemies {{until they reach}} the end and defeat a boss. In two-player mode, the characters can work together by having one ride the other piggy-back style. The character <b>riding</b> <b>controls</b> the attacks, while the character being <b>ridden</b> <b>controls</b> the movement and jumping. This can simplify areas with large or awkward jumps as it only requires one player to land successfully. After each stage is completed, a small scene occurs furthering the mostly simple and light-hearted plot, and the next stage is revealed.|$|R
25|$|It was {{introduced}} {{with the standard}} 3.8 liter Buick V6 (also known as the GM 3800 engine), with a 4.6 litre Cadillac Northstar LD8 V8 and the Chevrolet Corvette's Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> active suspension available as options. All General Motors 3.8 L V6 powered cars become the first SULEV-compliant vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Additional vehicle-specific {{diagnostic}} and control circuits {{are also available}} on this connector. For instance, on the Corvette there are interfaces for the Class 2 serial data stream from the PCM, the CCM diagnostic terminal, the radio data stream, the airbag system, the selective <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system, the low tire pressure warning system, and the passive keyless entry system.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, Chevrolet {{announced}} that 500 Z06 Carbon Limited Editions {{will be made}} available as a 2011 model beginning in Summer 2010. The car {{will be available in}} two colors: Inferno Orange and an all-new Supersonic Blue. On the exterior, the car will get black headlamps and mirrors, a ZR1-style spoiler, carbon fiber hood, and black carbon fiber rockers and splitter. Inside, the Z06 Carbon has ebony leather and suede seats with body color-matching stitching. Other improvements include Magnetic Selective <b>Ride</b> <b>Control,</b> a special carbon engine cover, 20-spoke black 19-inch front/20-inch rear wheels, and ZR1’s carbon ceramic Brembo brakes.|$|E

25|$|A 50th Anniversary Edition (RPO Z25) {{was offered}} during the 2003 model year to commemorate a half-century of Corvette production. Available in {{convertible}} and coupe models (but {{not with the}} Z06), the 50th Anniversary Edition came with a special shade of red paint ("Anniversary Red Metallic") and shale two-tone leather interior; Anniversary Edition convertibles were adorned with a shale-colored soft top as well. A new option for Corvette in 2003, the F55 Magnetic Selective <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> Suspension was standard on the 1SC-equipped Anniversary Edition vehicles. Special ("Warm Nickel Metallic") painted aluminum wheels, embroidered upholstery trim, and badges completed the Anniversary Edition package. Also included were all of the convenience options offered on the upscale Corvette models.|$|E
25|$|Carbon fiber {{is used on}} the roof, hood, fenders, front {{splitter}}, and rocker moldings; {{the hood}} and fenders are painted over, while the roof and splitter are merely covered in a clear-coat, retaining their black color. A polycarbonate window {{is placed in the}} center of the hood, allowing the engine intercooler to be seen from the exterior. The wheels are the largest ever placed on a production Corvette, with both front and rear wheels increasing in size and diameter over the Corvette Z06. Carbon-ceramic brakes are included. The brake calipers are painted blue, as are the engine intercooler trim and the ZR1 logo. Magnetic Selective <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> is also included on the car, with sensors to automatically adjust stiffness levels based on road conditions and vehicle movement.|$|E
500|$|Like the E-series HSV GTS, the {{suspension}} is fitted with switchable Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide") offering Luxury or Performance modes. It does this by electrically adjusting the viscosity of the ferrofluid inside the shock absorbers, producing different damping levels. Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> also enhances braking by preventing forward weight transfer {{when the car}} is under heavy braking. The MRC system development took three years and cost HSV more than $4.5 million.|$|E

500|$|It {{features}} recalibrated Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide") and stiffer suspension settings {{than the}} HSV GTS, {{as well as}} a toughened 6-speed manual gearbox, a new exhaust system, larger 6-piston brakes, and strengthened limited-slip differential.|$|E
500|$|The GTS has usually used a more {{powerful}} engine and robust drivetrain than other HSV models, however the E-Series 1 GTS shared the 6.0L LS2 V8 engine with 412bhp (307kW) of power and 405lb·ft (550 N·m) of torque, with the cheaper Clubsport and the luxury Senator. The major difference between the E-Series GTS and other HSV models in the range is the Magnetic <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> (MRC, or [...] "MagneRide"). MRC utilises magnetorheological dampers to improve the car's handling and dynamics. In the GTS, the MRC can be switched between Performance and Track response modes {{at the touch of}} a button. MRC is not available on the Clubsport; it is standard equipment of the Senator, but switches between [...] "Luxury" [...] and [...] "Performance", there is no [...] "Track" [...] mode like the GTS has.|$|E
2500|$|Suspension {{choices for}} the base model C5 were limited to the {{standard}} suspension (RPO FE1), with options for either the autocross-inspired FE3 Sport Suspension (included with the Z51 Performance & Handling Package and standard on the 1999–2000 FRC); or the F45 Selective <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> Suspension, which permitted [...] "on-the-fly" [...] driver selection of different ride characteristics (sport or touring). Late in the production run (starting with the 2003 model year), the F55 Magnetic Selective <b>Ride</b> <b>Control</b> Suspension replaced the F45 as the third suspension choice. The racing-inspired FE4 suspension used for the Z06 is stiffer again than any offered on the base model C5, and is unique to that model with no optional suspensions offered. The C5's suspension consisted of independent unequal-length double wishbones with transverse fiberglass mono-leaf springs and optional magnetorheological dampers.|$|E

2500|$|The Alpine Sleigh Ride {{was a dark}} ride {{attraction}} {{which opened}} during the park's first season. It had a <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> system and vehicles (ArrowGlide) designed by Arrow Development. Riders passed through an alpine forest before reaching the show building {{which was designed to}} resemble a large mountain capped with snow. A waterfall cascaded from atop the mountain and down into a catch pond near the mountain's base. Once past the waterfall, riders would journey through many chambers within the mountain. These included an echo tunnel and an avalanche room with simulated snow. At several points throughout the ride, the vehicles would exit and travel along the exterior of the mountain-themed show building. The sleigh-themed vehicles were powered by an electrical bus bar where portions of the track ascended, and they were gravity powered during the descents which featured several surprise dips. Part of the show building was shared with the adjacent gas powered car ride (Le Taxi) which passed through a tunnel {{in the side of the}} mountain. The ride included an appearance by the [...] "Abominable Snowman". Alpine Sleigh Ride was retired after the 1983 operating season.|$|E
2500|$|The Gran Torino Sport {{was offered}} in two body styles: A 2-door formal hardtop and a 2-door SportsRoof, also a hardtop. All Sport models {{featured}} an integrated hood scoop, {{which was only}} functional with the optional and rare Ram Air Induction system. Also included with this model was twin colour-keyed racing mirrors, moulded door panels unique to the Sport model, body-side and wheel lip moldings, and F70-14 tires (E70-14 on hardtop models). A revised full body length laser stripe remained an option. It replaced the chrome side molding, and was available in four colours to match the exterior paint. For the driving enthusiast, the [...] "Rallye Equipment Group" [...] included the Instrumentation Group, Competition Suspension, G70-14 tires with raised white letters, and a Hurst shifter for those equipped with the 4-speed. The Rallye Equipment Group was available the 351CJ-4V or the 429-4V exclusively. The Competition Suspension was highly regarded by Tom McCahill of Mechanix illustrated, as well as Motor Trend and Car and Driver as being less harsh than past Torino performance suspensions, while still offering excellent handling. Motor Trend described the suspension as [...] "Unlike the super heavy-duty springs of years past, the folks at Ford have managed to produce superior <b>ride</b> <b>control</b> without harshness. It takes a ride in one [...] to truly appreciate it." [...] Torino's new and improved chassis and suspension design {{can be attributed to}} this improvement.|$|E
