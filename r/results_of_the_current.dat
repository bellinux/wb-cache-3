50|$|Maps are {{generated}} pseudo-randomly {{to create a}} range of walls and cover, as well as starting positions for the soldiers. On each turn, the players are given an unlimited {{amount of time to}} lay out commands to each soldier to specific waypoints that will be performed during the resolution of the round, a period of about 5 seconds of simulation time. The player can set the direction that the soldier is looking, the soldier's stance and speed, and their default action upon seeing an enemy force in their line of sight. The game provides a facility to review all previous turns and simulate the projected <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current,</b> assuming that enemy forces maintain their current strategies, giving the player to refine their actions.|$|E

The attack allows a trade-off between <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> plaintext/ciphertext pairs and the time for the attacker’s computations.

One of these uses continuous domain filters while the other uses discrete processing. This result has obvious benefits in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> <b>the</b> afore mentioned problem.

30|$|The two-factor {{structure}} was anticipated because we believe, and the expectancy-value model holds (Eccles et al. 1983), that achievement-related tasks (i.e., {{the decision to}} choose and persist in STEM majors) {{may be influenced by}} the value that the individuals attach to STEM fields and how well they expect to perform in STEM-related careers. Thus, it was not surprising that <b>the</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> study indicated that women who persisted in STEM majors had higher expectations for success in STEM careers and placed a higher value on the STEM fields than did women who switched from STEM majors.|$|R
30|$|Modern {{medical imaging}} is focused around {{high-resolution}} image data, which {{is capable of}} delivering increasingly more information to medical practitioners, which in turn leads to improvement in detection rates and increased precision of computer-aided surgeries and planning.
