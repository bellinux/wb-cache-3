40|$|After the {{prediction}} that strong enough optical activity {{may result in}} negative refraction and negative reflection, more and more artificial chiral metamaterials were designed and fabricated at difference frequency ranges from microwaves to optical waves. Therefore, a simple and robust method to retrieve the effective constitutive parameters for chiral metamaterials is urgently needed. Here, we analyze the wave propagation in chiral metamaterials and follow the regular retrieval procedure for ordinary metamaterials and apply it in chiral metamaterial slabs. Then based on the transfer matrix technique, the parameter retrieval is extended to treat samples with not only the substrate but also the top layers. After the parameter retrieval procedure, we take two examples to check our method and study how the substrate influences on the thin chiral metamaterials slabs. We find that the substrate may cause the homogeneous slab to be inhomogeneous, i. e. the reflections in forward and backward directions are different. However, the chiral metamaterial where the <b>resonance</b> <b>element</b> is embedded {{far away from the}} substrate is insensitive to the substrate. Comment: 15 pages, 6 figure...|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} form of cancer among men in Europe and the US is {{prostate}} cancer. When a radical prostatectomy has been found necessary, it is of interest to examine the prostate, as tumour tissue on the capsule might indicate that the cancer has metastased. This is commonly done by a microscope-based morphometric investigation. Tumour tissue is normally stiffer than healthy tissue. Sensors based on piezoelectric resonance technology have been introduced into the medical field during the last decade. By studying the change in resonance frequency when a sensor comes into contact with a material, conclusions can be drawn about the material. A new and flexible measurement system using a piezoelectric resonance sensor has been evaluated. Three translation stages, two for horizontal movements and one for vertical movement, with stepper motors are controlled from a PC. A piezoelectric <b>resonance</b> <b>element</b> and a force sensor are integrated into a sensor head that is mounted on the vertical translation stage. The piezoelectric element is connected to a feed-back circuit and resonating at its resonance frequency until it comes into contact with a material, when a frequency shift can be observed. The force sensor is used to measure the applied force between the sensor and the material. These two parameters are combined into a third, called the stiffness parameter, which is important for stiffness evaluation. For measurements on objects with different geometries, the vertical translation stage can be aimed at a platform for flat objects or a fixture for spherical objects. The vertical translation stage is mounted on a manual rotational stage with which the contact angle between the sensor and the measured surface can be adjusted. The contact angles covered are between 0 ° and 35 ° from a line perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} measured object. The measured objects used were made from silicones of different stiffness and in the shape of flat discs and spheres. The indentation velocity of the sensor can be set at 1 mm/s to 5 mm/s. In the three papers that are the base for this licentiate thesis, we have investigated the dependence of the frequency shift, the applied force and the stiffness parameter on the contact angle, and the indentation velocity at different impression depths. The maximum error for the measurement system has also been determined. The results of the measurements indicate that great care must be taken when aiming the sensor against the surface of the point where the measurements are to be performed. Deviations in contact angle of more than iv± 10 ° from a line perpendicular to the surface will result in an underestimation of the frequency shift, meaning that the tissue will be regarded as stiffer than it really is. This result is important as the flat silicone models have a very even surface, which makes a controlled contact angle possible. Biological tissue can have a rough and uneven surface, which can lead to unintentional deviations in the contact angle. The magnitude of the stiffness parameter is favoured by a high indentation velocity compared to a low. The evaluation of this measurement system has shown that it is possible to distinguish between soft and stiff silicone models, which have been used in this initial phase of the study. A new feature in this measurement system is the fixture that makes measurements on spherical objects possible and the possibility to vary the angle of contact. This is promising for future studies and measurements on whole prostate in vitro. A future application for this measurement system is to aid surgeons performing radical prostatectomy in the search for tumour tissue on the capsule of the prostate, as the presence of tumour tissue can indicate that the cancer has spread to the surrounding tissue...|$|E

A method is proposed based on effective permittivity, characteristic impedance and loss of themicrostrip line with tunable air heterogeneity. The scattering matrix is derived from finite element models. A verification of the method is performed through experiments. The influence of the physical and topological parameters of the microstrip line with air heterogeneity on its equivalent parameters is analyzed.

40|$|The paper {{reports on}} {{investigations}} into phase {{characteristic of a}} unit cell of a single-layer microstrip reflectarray, which includes patch or ring elements of variable size.

The results obtained for single <b>resonance</b> <b>elements</b> demonstrate that a slower slope can be achieved using thicker substrates at the expense of an inadequate phase range of less than 300 deg. This inadequate phase range leads to the reflectarray elements phase errors, which reduce its directivity. To overcome this problem the use of multiresonance multiring elements is postulated. It is shown that square and circular shaped multiple rings printed on a thick substrate can offer a slower phase slope and the phase range exceeding 360 deg. The achieved slopes and ranges of double rings are comparable with those of double stacked patches printed on the equivalent low permittivity dielectric substrate. Choosing suitable dimensions of double-ring elements, the phase characteristic can be made approximately a linear function of their size...|$|R

40|$|Although the {{invention}} of the metamaterials has stimulated the interest of many researchers and possesses many important applications, the basic design idea is very simple: composing effective media from many small structured elements and controlling its artificial EM properties. According to the effective-media model, the coupling interactions between the elements in metamaterials are somewhat ignored; therefore, the effective properties of metamaterials can be viewed as the "averaged effect" of the resonance property of the individual elements. However, the coupling interaction between elements should always exist when they are arranged into metamaterials. Sometimes, especially when the elements are very close, this coupling effect is not negligible and will have a substantial effect on the metamaterials' properties. In recent years, {{it has been shown that}} the interaction between <b>resonance</b> <b>elements</b> in metamaterials could lead to some novel phenomena and interesting applications that do not exist in conventional uncoupled metamaterials. In this paper, we will give a review of these recent developments in coupled metamaterials. For the "meta-molecule" composed of several identical resonators, the coupling between these units produces multiple discrete resonance modes due to hybridization. In the case of a "meta-crystal" comprising an infinite number of resonators, these multiple discrete resonances can be extended to form a continuous frequency band by strong coupling. This kind of broadband and tunable coupled metamaterial may have interesting applications. Many novel metamaterials and nanophotonic devices could be developed from coupled resonator systems in the future. Comment: This is a review pape...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{multiconfiguration}} molecular mechanics (MCMM) {{method is}} a general algorithm for generating potential energy surfaces for chemical reactions by fitting high-level electronic structure data {{with the help of}} molecular mechanical (MM) potentials. It was previously developed as an extension of standard MM to reactive systems by inclusion of multidimensional resonance interactions between MM configurations corresponding to specific valence bonding patterns, with the <b>resonance</b> matrix <b>element</b> obtained from quantum mechanical (QM) electronic structure calculations. In particular, the <b>resonance</b> matrix <b>element</b> is obtained by multidimensional inter-polation employing a finite number of geometries at which electronic-structure calculations of the energy, gradient, and Hessian are carried out. In this paper, we present a strategy for com-bining MCMM with hybrid quantum mechanical molecular mechanical (QM/MM) methods. In the new scheme, electronic-structure information for obtaining the resonance integral is obtained by means of hybrid QM/MM calculations instead of fully QM calculations. As such, the new strategy {{can be applied to the}} studies of very large reactive systems. The new MCMM scheme is tested for two hydrogen-transfer reactions. Very encouraging convergence is obtained for rate constants including tunneling, suggesting that the new MCMM method, called QM/MM-MCMM, is a very general, stable, and efficient procedure for generating potential energy surfaces for large reactive systems. The results are found to converge well with respect to the number of Hessians. The results are also compared to calculations in which the resonance integral data are obtained by pure QM, and this illustrates the sensitivity of reaction rate calculations to the treatment of the QM-MM border. For the smaller of the two systems, comparison is also made to direct dynamics calculations in which the potential energies are computed quantum mechanically on the fly. 1...|$|R
