25|$|Unit 1 was {{designed}} for a peak ground acceleration of 0.18g (1.74m/s2) and a <b>response</b> <b>spectrum</b> based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake, but rated for 0.498 g. The design basis for Units 3 and 6 were 0.45 g (4.41m/s2) and 0.46 g (4.48m/s2) respectively. All units were inspected after the 1978 Miyagi earthquake when the ground acceleration was 0.125g (1.22m/s2) for 30 seconds, but no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was discovered. The design basis for tsunamis was 5.7 meters.|$|E
25|$|The Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant {{consisted}} of six GE light water boiling water reactors (BWRs) {{with a combined}} power of 4.7 gigawatts, {{making it one of}} the world's 25 largest nuclear power stations. It was the first GE-designed nuclear plant to be constructed and run entirely by the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO). Reactor 1 was a 439 MWe type (BWR-3) reactor constructed in July 1967, and commenced operation on 26 March 1971. It was designed to withstand an earthquake with a peak ground acceleration of 0.18 g (1.74m/s2) and a <b>response</b> <b>spectrum</b> based on the 1952 Kern County earthquake. Reactors 2 and 3 were both 784 MWe type BWR-4s. Reactor 2 commenced operation in July 1974, and Reactor 3 in March 1976. The earthquake design basis for all units ranged from 0.42g (4.12m/s2) to 0.46g (4.52m/s2). After the 1978 Miyagi earthquake, when the ground acceleration reached 0.125g (1.22m/s2) for 30seconds, no damage to the critical parts of the reactor was found. Units 1–5 have a Mark-1 type (light bulb torus) containment structure; unit 6 has Mark 2-type (over/under) containment structure. In September 2010, Reactor 3 was partially fueled by mixed-oxides (MOX).|$|E

The probabilistic DBE <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> will replace the deterministic DBE <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> currently in the U. S. Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office (DOE-ID) Architectural Engineering Standards that govern seismic design criteria for several facility areas at the INEEL. Probabilistic DBE <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> are recommended to DOE Naval Reactors for use at the Naval Reactor Facility at INEEL. The site-specific Uniform Hazard Spectra (UHS) developed by URS Greiner Woodward Clyde Federal Services are {{used as the basis}} for developing the DBE <b>response</b> <b>spectra.</b> In 1999, the UHS for all INEEL facility areas were recomputed using more appropriate attenuation relationships for the Basin and Range province. The revised UHS have lower ground motions than those produced in the 1996 INEEL site-wide probabilistic ground motion study. The DBE <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> were developed by incorporating smoothed broadened regions of the peak accelerations, velocities, and displacements defined by the site-specific UHS.

40|$|Seismic <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> with {{structural}} damping ratio other than nominal 5 % (of critical damping) {{are essential for}} the design and evaluation of structures in performance-based seismic engineering. Such <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> are also essential for the design and evaluation of structures with seismic isolation and energy dissipation systems. A number of formulations for damping modification factors (DMF) have been proposed in the literature for scaling the 5 % damped <b>response</b> <b>spectra.</b> Dependence of the DMF on several ground motion parameters has also been identified. Few seismic design codes have already incorporated simplified DMF based on these studies. This paper critic ally reviews the available formulations for DMF for seismic <b>response</b> <b>spectra.</b> Analytical investigations on the ground motion <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> at soil sites, based {{on a wide range}} of simulated ground motion records, have been carried out. It has been observed that the DMF for ground motion <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> at soil sites is significantly dependent on site period, which has not been identified in previous studies. The influences of earthquake shaking level, earthquake source-site distance (near-field and far-field events), soil plasticity index, and the rigidity of bedrock have also been investigated...|$|R
30|$|The PGAs, PGVs, and <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> were {{calculated}} from the bandpass-filtered strong-motion seismograms with a cutoff frequency of 0.07  Hz. We computed two types of response spectra: absolute acceleration <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> and absolute velocity <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> for a 5 % damping ratio. The <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> were computed following the method of Nigam and Jennings (1969). The values of the PGAs and PGVs were taken as the maximum values of the vector sum (i.e., the square root of the sum of squares) of two horizontal component acceleration and velocity time histories, respectively, over the available time steps, while the <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> were obtained as the maximum values of the vector sum of two horizontal component response time histories computed for the corresponding periods. The F-net broadband recordings were processed to correct {{for the effects of}} instrumental response, and PGVs were computed at different passband frequencies from the two horizontal component recordings similar to the PGVs of strong-motion recordings.|$|R

50|$|The Extreme <b>Response</b> <b>Spectrum</b> (ERS) (or Maximum <b>Response</b> <b>Spectrum</b> (MRS)) {{is defined}} as a curve giving the value of the highest peak of the {{response}} of a linear Single Degree of Freedom System (SDOF system) to vibration, according to its natural frequency, for a given damping ratio. The response is described here by the relative movement of the mass of this system in relation to its support. The x-axis refers to the natural frequency and the y-axis to the highest peak multiplied by the square of the quantity (2 π x natural frequency), by analogy with the relative displacement shock <b>response</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{structural}} engineering seismic loads usually are calculated based on <b>response</b> <b>spectra.</b> In the {{cases where the}} evaluation of non-normative site-specific <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> is required, usually empirical evaluations of real earthquake registrations are used. Earthquake energy is described by magnitude and seismic impact by macroseismic intensity. In literature, there are numerous equations to calculate <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> based on magnitude, distance and soil conditions, but there are almost no studies about intensity-based <b>response</b> <b>spectra.</b> Despite of {{the increasing number of}} metrological determined magnitudes, intensity is still an important parameter. Many seismic hazard maps refer to intensities and even some codes and regulatory guides use intensity values. The presented work shows the coherence between macroseismic intensity and other parameters that influence intensity. The way to do it has consisted of collecting and evaluating enough strong motion registrations to provide intensity and soil dependent <b>response</b> <b>spectra.</b> The evaluation considered the influence of ground type, deeper subsoil, magnitude, distance and type of structure. California was chosen as test area. In total, 411 horizontal components from nine earthquakes were evaluated, after assembling information about magnitude, distance and local soil conditions. Using detailed macroseismic information about the seismic impact, a local intensity was assigned to every registration according to the closest observed intensities in the site vicinity. From all the records the <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> were calculated. Then, for specific groups of <b>response</b> <b>spectra,</b> according to intensity, soil class and other parameters, median spectral values were calculated as well as standard deviation. In addition to the empirical evaluation of the <b>response</b> <b>spectra,</b> some examples of soil dynamic calculations were performed. The coherence between the evaluated <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> and structural vulnerability as well as the applicability to European earthquake prone areas was discussed. The strong motion duration was calculated from all records according to different definitions to probe the suitability of these definitions in the context of macroseismic intensities. Finally, a correlation analysis with different seismic parameters was carried out...|$|R
40|$|Although <b>response</b> <b>spectra</b> {{have been}} in general use for decades by researchers, academics, and {{geotechnical}} professionals, their use by structural design professionals has generally been limited.
