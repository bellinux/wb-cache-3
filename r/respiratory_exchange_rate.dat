To explore the function of SIRT 3 in skeletal muscle, we report here {{the establishment of a}} transgenic mouse model with muscle-specific expression of the murine SIRT 3 short isoform (SIRT 3 M 3). Calorimetry study revealed that the transgenic mice had increased energy expenditure and lower <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (RER), indicating a shift towards lipid oxidation for fuel usage, compared to control mice. The transgenic mice exhibited better exercise performance on treadmills, running 45 % further than control animals. Moreover, the transgenic mice displayed higher proportion of slow oxidative muscle fibers, with increased muscle AMPK activation and PPARd expression, both of which are known regulators promoting type I muscle fiber specification. Surprisingly, transgenic expression of SIRT 3 M 3 reduced muscle mass up to 30 %, likely through an up-regulation of FOXO 1 transcription factor and its downstream atrophy gene MuRF- 1. In summary, these results suggest that SIRT 3 regulates the formation of oxidative muscle fiber, improves muscle metabolic function, and reduces muscle mass, changes that mimic th...|$|E
40|$|Background: There {{are popular}} {{reports on the}} {{combined}} use of alcohol and energy drinks (such as Red Bull ® and similar beverages, which contain caffeine, taurine, carbohydrates, etc.) to reduce the depressant effects of alcohol on central nervous system, but no controlled studies have been performed. The main {{purpose of this study}} was to verify the effects of alcohol, and alcohol combined with energy drink, on the performance of volunteers in a maximal effort test (cycle ergometer) and also on physiological indicators (oxygen uptake, ventilatory threshold, <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> heart rate, and blood pressure), biochem-ical variables (glucose, lactate, insulin, cortisol, ACTH, dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline), and blood alcohol levels. Methods: Fourteen healthy subjects completed a double-blind protocol made up of four sessions: control (water), alcohol (1. 0 g/kg), energy drink (3. 57 ml/kg Red Bull®), and alcohol energy drink, each 1 week apart. The effort test began 60 min after drug or control ingestion, and the dependent variables were measured until 60 min after the test. Results: Heart rate at the ventilatory threshold was higher in the alcohol and alcohol energy drink sessions in comparison with control and energy drink sessions.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to compare the efficacy of three different cardiopulmonary resuscitation techniques: (a) standard cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), (b) active compression-decompression cardiopulmonary resuscitation (ACD-CPR) with the rescuer standing beside the patient (ACD-B), and (c) ACD-CPR with the rescuer in a standing position over the patient (ACD-S). The physiological responses of the rescuers when performing these techniques were also evaluated. A total of 14 experienced professional rescuers of a mobile intensive care unit (32 ± 6 years), participated in this investigation. On 3 different days (randomised order), each of them performed on a manikin (a) CPR, (b) ACD-B, and (c) ACD-S. Parameters indicative of both CPR performance (time to exhaustion, compression depth and efficacy), and rescuers' physiological responses (blood lactate; minute ventilation (VE); heart rate (HR); oxygen uptake V(O 2); <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (RER); and percentage of V(O 2 max) were monitored during the trials. The main findings of this investigation were: (a) the evidence of a greater physiological load for the rescuers during the ACD-CPR techniques compared to CPR, which caused a longer performance time with CPR as compared to ACD-CPR; (b) the overall absence of physiological differences between ACD-B and ACD-S; and (c) a modest decrease in mechanical efficacy for ACD-S when compared to ACD-B.

RE was assessed during three submaximal treadmill runs at 14, 16, and 18 km/h before and at the completion of each intervention. V 02, minute ventilation (VE), <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> ratio, heart <b>rate,</b> and blood lactate concentration were determined during the final 60 s of each run, whereas hemoglobin mass (Hbmass) was measured on a separate occasion. All testing was performed under normoxic conditions at similar to 600 m.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to develop a heat stress model, based on the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) index. Design/methodology/approach– Field studies were conducted during the summer time in Hong Kong (July to September 2010). Based upon 281 sets of synchronized meteorological and physiological data collected from construction workers in four different construction sites between July and September 2010, physiological, work‐related, environmental and personal parameters were measured to construct and verify the heat stress model. Findings– It is found that drinking habit, age and work duration are the top three significant predictors to determine construction workers' physiological responses. Other predictors include percentage of body fat, resting heart rate, air pollution index, WBGT, smoking habit, energy consumption, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> The accuracy of the model is verified against data which have not been used in developing the model.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Obesity is an {{increasingly}} prevalent health problem, and natural effective therapeutic approaches {{are required to}} prevent its occurrence. Phytoestrogens are plant-derived compounds with estrogenic activities; they can bind to both estrogen receptors alpha and beta and mimic the action of estrogens on target organs. OBJECTIVES: The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the influence of soy-derived phytoestrogens on energy balance and metabolism. METHODS: Male outbred mice (CD- 1) were allowed ad libitum access to either a high soy-containing diet or a soy-free diet from conception to adulthood. We measured circulating serum isoflavone levels using reverse-phase solid-phase extraction for subsequent liquid chromatography electrospray tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Adult animals were analyzed for body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, locomotor activity by running-wheel experiments, <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> by indirect calorimetry, and food intake using metabolic cages. Quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptide genes. RESULTS: We found that adult mice fed a soy-rich diet had reduced body weight, adiposity, and resistance to cold. This lean phenotype was associated with an increase in lipid oxidation due to a preferential use of lipids as fuel source and an increase in locomotor activity. The modulation of energy balance was associated with a central effect of phytoestrogens on the expression of hypothalamic neuropeptides, including agouti-related protein. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that dietary soy could have beneficial effects on obesity, but they also emphasize the importance of monitoring the phytoestrogen content of diets as a parameter of variability in animal experiments...|$|E

Stepwise regression analysis showed that better sailing level was for 46. 5 % predicted by lower MPF decrease. Lower MPF decrease was for 57. 8 % predicted by a higher maximal isometric quadriceps strength. In conclusion, this study indicates that higher sailing level was mainly determined by a lower rate of neuromuscular fatigue during the upwind sailing test (as indicated by MPF decrease).

The present study evaluated the metabolic effects of T 3 delivered during either 7 or 28 days to the paraventricular or ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN or VMH). T 3 administration for 7 days in the PVN decreased only plasma T 3. There were no effects on body weight, food intake, plasma glucose concentrations, energy expenditure, locomotor activity, and <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate.</b> In the liver and brown adipose tissue (BAT), there were no changes in mRNA expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism and thermogenesis. T 3 administration for 7 days in the VMH did not change any of these parameters.

Liver and BAT gene expression was unaltered, except for decreased liver Dio 1 mRNA. T 3 administration for 28 days in the VMH did not affect liver and BAT mRNA expression, body weight, food intake, and body temperature, whereas blood glucose concentrations were slightly lower.

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} evaluate, in adults, the {{efficacy}} of the Oxygen Uptake Efficiency Slope (OUES), an index of cardiopulmonary functional reserve that can be based upon a submaximal exercise effort. BACKGROUNDMaximal oxygen uptake (O 2 max), the most reliable measure of exercise capacity, is seldom attained in standard exercise testing. The OUES, which relates oxygen uptake to total ventilation during exercise, was proposed by Baba and coworkers (7) in a study of pediatric cardiac patients. They felt this submaximal index of cardiopulmonary reserve might be more practical than O 2 max and more appropriate than the commonly used peak oxygen consumption (O 2 peak). METHODSTreadmill exercise tests with simultaneous respiratory gas measurement were performed in 998 older subjects free of clinically recognized cardiovascular disease and 12 male patients with congestive heart failure. During incremental exercise, oxygen uptake was plotted against the logarithm of total ventilation, and the OUES was determined. RESULTSThe OUES, when calculated only from the first 75 % of the exercise test, differed by 1. 9 % from the OUES calculated from 100 % of exercise time in subjects with a peak <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> ≥ 1. 10. On serial tests the OUES was less variable than exercise duration or O 2 peak. It correlated strongly with O 2 max, with forced expiratory volume in 1 s and negatively with a history of current smoking. The OUES declined linearly with age in both women and men. A small sample of patients with congestive heart failure had OUES values much lower than those of older subjects without cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSIONSThe OUES is an objective, reproducible measure of cardiopulmonary reserve that does not require a maximal exercise effort. It integrates cardiovascular, musculoskeletal and respiratory function into a single index that is largely influenced by pulmonary dead space ventilation and exercise-induced lactic acidosis...|$|E

In this study the AccessTM bar was compared to a bar of equal macronutrient and caloric value, MyoplexTM Lite bar, and a non-caloric placebo, water. It was hypothesized that the AccessTM bar would not improve aerobic capacity above the other two conditions. Twelve subjects (10 male, 2 females) participated in this study. Aerobic endurance was measured by the total exercise time on a maximal graded exercise treadmill test, while fat utilization was measured by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (RER) at 60 % of the subject’s VO 2 max. The three supplements AccessTM bar (A), MyoplexTM Lite (M), and water (W) were administered one hour prior to each treadmill test, with one day of rest given between tests. The effects of the three independent variables on each subject’s performance during each condition were compared. A repeated measures design was used to analyze the data. The design was counterbalanced to ensure that the order of the treatment did not affect the results. The results showed that aerobic capacity, as measured by total exercise time, was similar in all three treatments; (A) X = 15. 98 min ± 3. 3, (M) X = 16. 6 min ± 3. 0 and (W) X = 15. 89 min ± 3. 3. {{there was no significant difference}} (p ≥. 05) observed in total exercise time between the three trials completed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the difference in the attainment rate of maximal oxygen uptake in cycling and running (%cycVO 2 max). Seven healthy male subjects (22. 9 ± 1. 3 yrs, 171. 9 ± 4. 7 cm, 61. 0 ± 5. 2 kg) participated in a maximal incremental exercise test for running and cycling. During the exercise testing, oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate,</b> minute ventilation, tidal volume, respiratory rate, and heart rate were measured. Attainment rates of each physiological measurement for cycling and running were shown as %cycVO 2 max, %cycVCO 2 max, %cycRERmax, %cycVEmax, %cycVt, %cycRR and %cycHRmax. Transverse relaxation time (T 2) -weighted spin echo images were acquired before and after the exercise periods. Exercise-induced T 2 values of each muscle and muscle-group are indices of muscular activity level, so the difference between the T 2 value of cycling and running in each muscle or muscle group was shown as ΔT 2 %. VO 2 max in cycling was 92. 2 % of VO 2 max in running. Significant correlations were observed between %cycVO 2 max and %cycVCO 2 max, %cycVO 2 max and %cycRR. Furthermore, significant correlations were recognized between %cycVO 2 max and ΔT 2 % of the m. quadriceps femoris, %cycVCO 2 max and ΔT 2 % of the m. quadriceps femoris, %cycVCO 2 max and the m. triceps surae, as well. These results show that the higher muscular activity level of the thigh in cycling increases the uptake of oxygen in the muscle. The T 2 value shows that the uptake or redistribution of fluid within muscle is driven by the accumulation of lactate and inorganic phosphate. Therefore, the T 2 value of maximal incremental exercise would reflect the anaerobic capacity of the muscle. Judging from the significant correlations between %cycVO 2 max and %cycVCO 2 max or %cycRR, the anaerobic capacity of each subject would also affect the difference between the maximal oxygen uptake of cycling and running...|$|E
40|$|We {{aimed to}} {{determine}} {{the frequency of the}} VO 2 max plateau phenomenon in top-level male professional road cyclists (n = 38; VO 2 max [mean +/- SD]: 73. 5 +/- 5. 5 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1)) and in healthy, sedentary male controls (n = 37; VO 2 max: 42. 7 +/- 5. 6 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1)). All subjects performed a continuous incremental cycle-ergometer test of 1 -min workloads until exhaustion. Power output was increased from a starting value of 25 W (cyclists) or 20 W (controls) at the rate of 25 W. min(- 1) (cyclists) or 20 W. min(- 1) (controls) until volitional exhaustion. We measured gas-exchange and heart rate (HR) throughout the test. Blood concentrations of lactate (BLa) were measured at end-exercise in both groups. We defined maximal exercise exertion as the attainment of a <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> (RER) >or= 1. 1; HR > 95 % age-predicted maximum; and BLa > 8 mmo. l(- 1). The VO 2 max plateau phenomenon was defined as an increase in two or more consecutive 1 -min mean VO 2 values of less than 1. 5 ml. kg(- 1). min(- 1). Most cyclists met our criteria for maximal exercise effort (RER > 1. 1, 100 %; 95 % predicted maximal HR [HRmax], 82 %; BLa > 8 mmol. l(- 1), 84 %). However, the proportion of cyclists attaining a V. O (2 max) plateau was considerably lower, i. e., 47 %. The majority of controls met the criteria for maximal exercise effort (RER > 1. 1, 100 %; predicted HRmax, 68 %; BLa > 8 mmol. l(- 1), 73 %), but the proportion of these subjects with a VO 2 max plateau was only 24 % (significantly lower proportion than in cyclists [p < 0. 05]). Scientists should consider 1) if typical criteria of attainment of maximal effort are sufficiently stringent, especially in elite endurance athletes; and 2) whether those humans exhibiting the VO 2 max plateau phenomenon are those who perform an absolute maximum effort or there are additional distinctive features associated with this phenomenon...|$|E
40|$|Leukotriene antagonists are {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} exercise-induced bronchoconstriction. Montelukast is a specific cysteinyl-leukotriene receptor 1 antagonist without known effects on the pulmonary vessels, which in theory should be advantageous with respect to gas exchange. In addition to lung function, we investigated the effects of montelukast on parameters of gas exchange and physical performance in 16 asthmatics with exercise-induced bronchoconstriction in a double-blind cross-over placebo-controlled study. Subjects were tested at an ambient temperature of - 15 degrees C with a tread mill exercise protocol consisting of consecutive workloads of 80 % V'O(2 max) (6 min), rest (4 min), 60 % V'O(2 max) (6 min) and step increments of exercise until exhaustion. Montelukast reduced the maximum post-exercise fall in FEV 1 (P < 0. 01), improved the running time to exhaustion in 11 of 16 test subjects (one unchanged) (P = 0. 03), and reduced the Borg score at exhaustion (P = 0. 03) and the breathing frequency after 3 min at 60 % V'O(2 max) (P = 0. 03). V'(O 2), V'CO(2), minute ventilation, ventilatory equivalents, <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> ratio, heart <b>rate</b> and oxygen pulse were not significantly different after montelukast and placebo. We conclude that montelukast has a beneficial effect on physical performance in most adults with exercise-induced asthma without any observed effect on gas-exchange parameters...|$|R
40|$|In this {{experimental}} study on a prototype lever-propelled wheelchair, {{the effect of}} a range of mechanical advantages (MA) on physical strain, oxygen uptake, energy cost, mechanical efficiency, stroke frequency and perceived exertion was examined. Nine out of 10 male nonwheelchair users successfully performed five submaximal tests on a motor-driven treadmill in a prototype bi-manual asynchronous lever-propelled tricycle. Each test contained the same protocol, but made use of one of the five different MAs. In every test the inclination level increased by 1 % every third minute, starting on 0 % up to 3 %. The velocity was kept constant at 0. 97 m. s- 1. Variables measured included oxygen uptake, minute ventilation, <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> ratio, heart <b>rate,</b> and stroke frequency. Analysis for repeated measures was conducted on the main factors slope and MA and their interaction. Additional analysis include a multiple regression analysis. All statistics were conducted with a p < 0. 05 level of significance. MA had a significant effect (p < 0. 05) on oxygen uptake, energy cost, mechanical efficiency, and stroke frequency. These results suggest that the implementation of a range of MAs on a lever-propelled wheelchair may accommodate different external conditions (slope, climatic, surface conditions, sports, and recreational conditions) and different user groups more readily. This may improve the social radius of action and freedom of mobility of individuals confined to wheelchairs...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{establish}} a graded exercise test protocol for determining the peak physiological responses of female outrigger canoeists. Seventeen trained female outrigger canoeists completed two outrigger ergometer graded exercise test protocols in random order: (1) 25 W power output for 2 min increasing by 7. 5 W every minute until exhaustion; and (2) 25 W power output for 2 min increasing by 15 W every 2 min to exhaustion. Heart rate and power output were recorded every 15 s. Expired air was collected continuously and sampled for analysis at 15 -s intervals, while blood lactate concentration was measured immediately after and 3, 5, and 7 min after exercise. The peak physiological and performance variables examined included peak oxygen uptake ([Vdot]O 2 peak), minute ventilation, tidal volume, ventilatory thresholds 1 and 2, <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate,</b> <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> ratio, heart <b>rate,</b> blood lactate concentration, power output, performance time, and time to [Vdot]O 2 peak. There were no significant differences in peak physiological responses, ventilatory thresholds or performance variables between the two graded exercise test protocols. Despite no significant differences between protocols, due to the large limits of agreement evident between protocols for the peak physiological responses, it is recommended that the same protocol be used for all comparison testing to minimize intra-individual variability of results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was, using two {{transgenic}} models, to investigate some metabolic diseases associated with acromegaly e. g. hypertension and alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. We also studied {{the positive effect of}} Growth Hormone (GH), and possible molecular causes, on body composition and energy homeostasis using these GH transgenic models. We have used two different GH transgenic mouse models, one model overexpressing GH generally, controlled by the metallothionine promoter (Mt-bGH), and one model where the GH overexpression is restricted to the CNS, using the glial fibrillary acidic protein promoter (GFAP-bGH). Using telemetric technique, we have found that Mt-bGH transgenic mice have a salt-insensitive hypertension. Furthermore, the Mt-bGH transgenic mice have altered lipoprotein profiles and serum lipids, hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycaemia. Moreover, the hepatic gene expression profiles analysed by micro-array, revealed decreased gene expression of PPARa and SREBP- 1 together with decreased expression of genes involved in fatty acid activation, b-oxidation, ketone body formation, lipogenesis, cholesterol metabolism, gluconeogenesis and amino acid catabolism. When analysed by indirect calorimetry, the Mt-bGH transgenic mice also had an increased resting metabolic rate on a normal diet that was enhanced by a Western diet, increased body temperature and increased hepatic gene expression of UCP 2. Furthermore, the Mt-bGH transgenic mice had an increased <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>rate</b> and food intake on both diets but still a lean body composition. The GFAP-bGH mice had an increased food intake resulting in massive obesity along with an increased expression of AGRP and NPY. These mice also had alterations in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism, hyperinsulinemia and pancreatic islet hypertrophy but normal blood glucose levels. GH stimulates food intake by increasing the hypothalamic gene expression of AGRP and NPY. This results in obesity in the GFAP-bGH transgenic mice but the high circulating levels of GH in the Mt-bGH mice, resulting in elevated RMR, body temperature, and T 3 levels prevent obesity and result in a lean body composition. We have also found several risk factors for cardiovascular disease in these two GH transgenic models, such as high LDL cholesterol, insulin resistance, hypertension and indications of a decreased reverse cholesterol transport. These models may be useful tools in understanding the underlying mechanisms for cardiovascular disease in patients with acromegaly...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether running economy is affected by isokinetic eccentric exercise designed to cause muscle damage. Twenty-four young healthy men performed 120 maximal voluntary eccentric actions at each thigh's quadriceps muscle at an angular velocity of 60 degrees. s. The participants were then randomly divided into 2 equal groups, 1 of which exercised 24 hours later, while the other group rested. Muscle damage indicators (i. e., serum creatine kinase, delayed onset muscle soreness, and eccentric, concentric, and isometric peak torque) and running economy indicators (i. e., oxygen consumption, pulmonary ventilation, <b>respiratory</b> <b>exchange</b> ratio, <b>respiratory</b> <b>rate,</b> and heart rate during treadmill running at 2. 2 and 3. 3 m. s) were assessed prior to and 48 hours following the eccentric exercise. All muscle damage indicators changed significantly in both groups (p < 0. 05) in a way suggestive of considerable muscle damage. Running economy indicators of the exercise group demonstrated only an elevation of respiratory rate at 48 hours (p < 0. 05) and a tendency to lower economy compared to the resting group. It can be concluded that isokinetic eccentric exercise applied to the quadriceps femoris muscles did not affect running economy 48 hours later and that resting during this period tended to result in more economical running compared to exercising at 24 hours...|$|R
