5|$|Continuing in the {{tradition}} of previous editions, the championships comprised separate half marathon road races for men and women, with each race having an individual and international team aspect. Each nation could enter a maximum of five athletes per race and the team scores were calculated by combining the finishing times of each team's top three <b>runners.</b> Nations with less than three <b>runners</b> were disregarded for the team event and their <b>runners</b> competed for the individual prizes only.|$|E

50|$|An {{invisible}} <b>runner</b> normally travels at {{the speed}} of the current batter. For example, assume an invisible <b>runner</b> on first base while the batter hits the ball. If the fielding team reaches second base before the batter reaches first base, the invisible <b>runner</b> is out. Otherwise, the invisible <b>runner</b> is considered safe. Similarly, an invisible <b>runner</b> advances only as many bases as the actual <b>runner.</b> For example, if an invisible <b>runner</b> is on second base and the batter hits a single to the outfield, the invisible <b>runner</b> only proceeds to third, even though a physical <b>runner</b> would often score in a similar scenario.|$|R

50|$|Force plays, {{or force}} outs, {{are one of}} the two ways to get a <b>runner</b> out on a ground ball. For a fielder to get a forced, bumper-carred <b>runner</b> out, he needs only to {{retrieve}} the hit ball and (1) step on the base in question before the forced <b>runner</b> gets there, or (2) tag that <b>runner</b> before the <b>runner</b> gets there. For example, with a <b>runner</b> on first, the batter hits a ground ball to the second baseman. The <b>runner</b> on first is being bumper-carred or forced over to second by the advancing batter. Since this is a force play, the second baseman, once he catches the ball, needs only to step on second base or tag the <b>runner</b> before the bumper-carred <b>runner</b> gets there in order to get him out. A tag out, or tag play, the second way to get a <b>runner</b> out on a ground ball, involves an unforced <b>runner</b> and is much more difficult to execute.|$|R
40|$|We {{have the}} {{interest}} in the problem whether fish can pass safely through the rotating <b>runner</b> of water turbine. In the first report, the screw type <b>runner</b> was used and the rotating speed of <b>runner</b> which fish can pass through is from 60 rpm to 100 rpm and average flow speed in the <b>runner</b> is limited to maximum swimming speed of fish. In this paper, the maximum rotating speed of <b>runner</b> reaches to about 200 rpm using new improved <b>runner.</b> Several factors of improvement are for fish passing through the <b>runner</b> easily described in detail. Many pictures are also shown when fish pass through the <b>runner.</b> How the patterns fish are swimming in the rotating <b>runner</b> are also analized by the pictures...|$|R
5|$|Any <b>runners</b> {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any <b>runners</b> must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any <b>runners</b> on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the ball is caught. <b>Runners</b> may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to record two outs {{in the course of}} the same play. This is called a double play. Even three outs in one play, a triple play, {{is possible}}, though this is very rare. Players put out or retired must leave the field, returning to their team's dugout or bench. A runner may be stranded on base when a third out is recorded against another player on the team. Stranded <b>runners</b> do not benefit the team in its next turn at bat as every half-inning begins with the bases empty of <b>runners.</b>|$|E

5|$|Relay {{races are}} the only track and field event in which a team of <b>runners</b> {{directly}} compete against other teams. Typically, a team {{is made up of}} four <b>runners</b> of the same sex. Each runner completes their specified distance (referred to as a leg) before handing over a baton to a teammate, who then begins their leg upon receiving the baton. There is usually a designated area where athletes must exchange the baton. Teams may be disqualified if they fail to complete the change within the area, or if the baton is dropped during the race. A team may also be disqualified if its <b>runners</b> are deemed to have wilfully impeded other competitors.|$|E
