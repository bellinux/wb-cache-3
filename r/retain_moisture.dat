5|$|Also in {{the park}} are the black, lumpy, very slow-growing colonies of cryptobiotic soil, which are a mix of lichens, algae, fungi, and cyanobacteria. Together these organisms slow erosion, add {{nitrogen}} to soil, and help it to <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b>|$|E
5|$|Different soil types suit {{different}} crops, but {{in general}} in temperate climates, sandy soils dry out fast but warm up quickly {{in the spring and}} are suitable for early crops, while heavy clays <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> better and are more suitable for late season crops. The growing season can be lengthened by the use of fleece, cloches, plastic mulch, polytunnels, and greenhouses. In hotter regions, the production of vegetables is constrained by the climate, especially the pattern of rainfall, while in temperate zones, it is constrained by the temperature and day length.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the cypress}} domes and strands <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> and block out {{much of the}} sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom {{throughout}} the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests {{and in the past}} 100years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the 1990s less than 2,000 were counted.|$|E

50|$|In California, growers {{have used}} a method of {{cultivation}} called dry-farming, especially with Early Girl tomatoes. This technique encourages the plant to send roots deep to find existing moisture in soil that <b>retains</b> <b>moisture,</b> such as clayey soil.|$|R
50|$|Its major uses in commercially {{prepared}} foods {{are as a}} thickener, sweetener, and humectant (an ingredient that <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> and thus maintains a food's freshness). Glucose syrup is also widely used {{in the manufacture of}} a variety of candy products.|$|R
5|$|Amphibians {{might seem}} {{unlikely}} desert-dwellers, {{because of their}} need to keep their skins moist and their dependence on water for reproductive purposes. In fact, the few species that are found in this habitat have made some remarkable adaptations. Most of them are fossorial, spending the hot dry months aestivating in deep burrows. While there they shed their skins {{a number of times}} and retain the remnants around them as a waterproof cocoon to <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b> In the Sonoran Desert, Couch's spadefoot toad spends most of the year dormant in its burrow. Heavy rain is the trigger for emergence and the first male to find a suitable pool calls to attract others. Eggs are laid and the tadpoles grow rapidly as they must reach metamorphosis before the water evaporates. As the desert dries out, the adult toads rebury themselves. The juveniles stay on the surface for a while, feeding and growing, but soon dig themselves burrows. Few make it to adulthood. The water holding frog in Australia has a similar life cycle and may aestivate for as long as five years if no rain falls. The Desert rain frog of Namibia is nocturnal and survives because of the damp sea fogs that roll in from the Atlantic.|$|E
25|$|Bonsai soil {{is usually}} a loose, fast-draining mix of components, often a base mixture of coarse sand or gravel, fired clay pellets, or {{expanded}} shale combined with an organic component such as peat or bark. The inorganic components provide mechanical support for bonsai roots, and—in the case of fired clay materials—also serve to <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b> The organic components <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> and may release small amounts of nutrients as they decay.|$|E
25|$|Durantou also {{believes}} {{that many of the}} benefits attributed to the blue-clay bouttonière exist apart from the crasse de fer, namely the clay's ability to <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> in dry years and produce wines of body and power, and notes that there is a second bouttonière of this blue-clay without the iron deposit located northwest of Pétrus. Among the vineyards with at least some planting on this second bouttonière are Château L'Église-Clinet, Château Trotanoy, Château Clos l'Église, Château La Cabanne and Château Nenin.|$|E

It uses glutenous rice flour in the batter to absorb excess water, and is topped with loquat [...] "honey" [...] (which is a honey like syrup) and buckwheat flakes to increase the crispiness for a longer time.|$|R
50|$|Contained entirely {{within the}} larger Ozark Mountain AVA, the area is drier than {{other parts of the}} state, but the soil of sandy loam and clay <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> well. The first grapevines in the Ozark Highlands were planted by Italian immigrants. All variety of grapes are grown in the area, {{including}} Vitis vinifera, Vitis labrusca, and French hybrids.|$|R
5000|$|Corn syrup's major uses in commercially {{prepared}} foods {{are as a}} thickener, a sweetener and as a humectant [...] - [...] an ingredient that <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> and thus maintains a food's freshness. Corn syrup (or HFCS) is the primary ingredient in most brands of commercial [...] "pancake syrup", as a less expensive substitute for maple syrup.|$|R
25|$|The Bangladeshi wickets {{receive a}} lot of rain fall in little time which {{reflects}} the soggy nature. The conditions vary from grounds like Sher-e-Bangla Cricket Stadium and Chittagong Divisional Stadium. The basic idea of producing wickets in Bangladesh is to avoid using grassroots when they are building up the layers of soil. The roots hold the water and <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> for an extended period. It helps bind the wicket better, making it a harder surface eventually. It also slows the process of wearing down.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation in Guatemala is {{concentrated}} in three regions of the country. The Atlantic coast region has low humidity and high evapotranspiration so irrigation is needed for the cultivation of bananas, tomatoes, watermelon, and tobacco. The high plains region has very little rain {{for much of the}} year and with fertile volcanic soils that do not <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> very well. Without irrigation, there is only one harvest per year so crops such as basic grains require irrigation. The lower coastal zones have irrigated sugarcane and banana plantations.|$|E
25|$|From {{the base}} to the summit, floral species {{diminish}} with increasingly shallow soil levels. The summit {{is home to}} many different specialized sub-alpine species which can <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> {{for long periods of}} time. Alpine and sub-alpine species include mountain ash, cotton grass, sheep laurel, mountain sandwort, and the mountain cranberry. Krummholz, trees stunted by harsh weather, are found on Mount Monadnock, as are several alpine bogs. Lower elevations on Mount Monadnock are clad in northern hardwood forest species; middle elevations support stands of red spruce. Before the fires, Mount Monadnock was totally covered in a red spruce forest. Since the summit has been barren of soil cover, red spruce have been slowly ascending back towards the top in a process known as ecological succession.|$|E
50|$|Fructose is {{quicker to}} absorb {{moisture}} and slower {{to release it}} to the environment than sucrose, glucose, or other nutritive sweeteners. Fructose is an excellent humectant and <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> {{for a long period}} of time even at low relative humidity (RH). Therefore, fructose can contribute a more palatable texture, and longer shelf life to the food products in which it is used.|$|R
50|$|Coreopsis lanceolata {{prefers a}} sandy, well-drained soil. Heavy, clay-based soil <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> in winter months, which can kill many species. However, rhizomatous coreopsis (underground stems) are well-adapted to {{withstand}} the extremes in soil moisture (both wet and dry). Adding compost to heavy soil can improve drainage as can creating a mounded bed, allows the planting area to shed rain faster than the ground around it.|$|R

The liquid inlet is a notch cut {{into the side of}} the needle, with a {{spring-loaded}} sliding rubber cap (shown) that slides up over the notch when the tank is removed. This design <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> inside the ink supply tubing and prevents dry-out and clogging when ink tanks are either not installed, or are removed for replacement.|$|R
25|$|Anatomical {{barriers}} include physical, {{chemical and}} biological barriers. The epithelial surfaces form a physical barrier that is impermeable to most infectious agents, acting as {{the first line of}} defense against invading organisms. Desquamation (shedding) of skin epithelium also helps remove bacteria and other infectious agents that have adhered to the epithelial surfaces. Lack of blood vessels and inability of the epidermis to <b>retain</b> <b>moisture,</b> presence of sebaceous glands in the dermis provides an environment unsuitable for the survival of microbes. In the gastrointestinal and respiratory tract, movement due to peristalsis or cilia, respectively, helps remove infectious agents. Also, mucus traps infectious agents. The gut flora can prevent the colonization of pathogenic bacteria by secreting toxic substances or by competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients or attachment to cell surfaces. The flushing action of tears and saliva helps prevent infection of the eyes and mouth.|$|E
25|$|Female {{frogs and}} toads usually spawn {{gelatinous}} egg masses containing thousands of eggs in water. Different species lay eggs in distinctive and identifiable ways. For example, the American toad lays long strings of eggs. The eggs are highly vulnerable to predation, so frogs have evolved many techniques to ensure {{the survival of the}} next generation. In colder areas the embryo is black to absorb more heat from the sun, which speeds up development. Most commonly, this involves synchronous reproduction. Many individuals will breed at the same time, overwhelming the actions of predators; the majority of the offspring will still die due to predation, but there is a greater chance some will survive. Another way in which some species avoid predators and the pathogens eggs are exposed to in ponds is to lay eggs on leaves above the pond, with a gelatinous coating designed to <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b> In these species the tadpoles drop into the water upon hatching. The eggs of some species laid out of water can detect vibrations of nearby predatory wasps or snakes, and will hatch early to avoid being eaten.|$|E
500|$|The {{scales of}} a snake {{primarily}} serve to reduce friction as it moves, since friction {{is the major}} source of energy loss in snake locomotion. [...] The ventral (or belly) scales, which are large and oblong, are especially low-friction, and some arboreal species can use the edges to grip branches. Snake skin and scales help <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> in the animal's body. Snakes pick up vibrations from both the air and the ground, and can differentiate the two, using a complex system of internal resonances (perhaps involving the scales).|$|E
50|$|Material {{larger than}} 2 inches in {{diameter}} {{will need to be}} crushed or removed. Crushed material is recycled back into the feed to be processed. Coarser-grained soils tend to be free-flowing and do not agglomerate into clumps. They typically do not <b>retain</b> excessive <b>moisture,</b> therefore, contaminants are easily desorbed. Finer-grained soils tend to <b>retain</b> soil <b>moisture</b> and agglomerate into clumps. When dry, they may yield large amounts of particulates that may require recycling after being intercepted in the baghouse.|$|R

2500|$|The {{climate is}} humid, with about [...] of {{precipitation}} per year, of {{which more than}} a third in the form of snow, forming a snow cover lasting on average 175 days. Spring is the driest season, and in certain years this relative dryness has important consequences for the environment, especially because the thinness of the soil <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> poorly. In the regions acid rain most powerfully affected, surveys indicated that the situation is getting better, the pH of the precipitation gently increasing.|$|R
2500|$|Kalahari Sands in the {{south-west}} of {{the country}} are infertile and do not <b>retain</b> <b>moisture,</b> so are dominated mostly by deep-rooted trees with little growth in the understorey. Grasslands both flooded and non-flooded also occur there [...]|$|E
2500|$|Botanicals, {{so-called}} [...] "natural pesticides", {{are used}} by some farmers {{in an attempt to}} control rice pests. Botanicals include extracts of leaves, or a mulch of the leaves themselves. Some upland rice farmers in Cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush (Chromolaena odorata) over the surface of fields after planting. This practice probably helps the soil <b>retain</b> <b>moisture</b> and thereby facilitates seed germination. Farmers also claim the leaves are a natural fertilizer and helps suppress weed and insect infestations.|$|E
2500|$|Climate: A mild climate [...] {{with high}} {{humidity}} (75% to 95%) {{is best for}} snail farming, though most varieties can stand {{a wider range of}} temperatures. The optimal temperature is [...] for many varieties. When the temperature falls below , snails hibernate. Under [...] the snails are inactive, and under , all growth stops. When the temperature rises much above [...] or conditions become too dry, snails estivate. Wind is bad for snails because it speeds up moisture loss, and snails must <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b>|$|E
50|$|Production and use {{of water}} {{conservation}} dams and reservoirs were also a community-based activities. Reservoirs might reach 90 ft in diameter by 12 ft deep, such as the reservoir near Far View House in Mesa Verde National Park. Terraced, silt-retaining check dams were created on sloping, drainage areas where melting snow or rain water ran downhill through the terraced dams. The dams <b>retained</b> <b>moisture</b> and silt and effectively managed runoff to lower terraces which made an ideal scenario for southwestern agriculture.|$|R
5000|$|Fat Lute {{was made}} of clay mixed with oil and beaten until it had the {{consistency}} of putty.

She has been through a total of 40 {{surgical}} operations to treat her injuries, and wore a plastic face mask for 23 hours a day, which flattened the scars and helped <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b> As part of her care from the National Health Service, Piper was treated at a clinic in Southern France. The treatment she received there was designed to break down scar tissue, and prevent skin contraction.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1990, Dahmer lured a 27-year-old {{acquaintance}} named Edward Smith to his apartment. He drugged and strangled Smith. On this occasion, {{rather than}} immediately acidifying the skeleton or repeating previous processes of bleaching (which had rendered previous victims' skulls brittle), Dahmer placed {{the skeleton of}} Smith in his freezer for several months in the hope it would not <b>retain</b> <b>moisture.</b> Freezing the skeleton did not remove moisture, and the skeleton would be acidified several months later. The skull was destroyed unintentionally when placed in the oven to dry—a process that caused the skull to explode.

Much used for hanging pots, tubs and basket cultivation. In the UK the bulbous double-headed types are preferred whilst on the European continent the balcon single types for large-scale hanging floral displays are favoured. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums embrace all such growth size types including small-leaved varieties and genetic hybrid crosses, which display little or no zonal characteristics. May have bicolour leaves and may have flowers that are single, double or rosette. Ivy pelargoniums are often sold as series such as 'Great Balls of Fire', {{in a variety of}} colours such as 'Great Balls of Fire Burgundy'.|$|E
50|$|A.ferrooxidans is a chemolithoautotrophic bacteria, {{due to the}} {{oligotrophic}} nature (low dissolved {{organic carbon}} concentration) of acidic environments, and their lack of illumination for phototrophy. Even when in vadose conditions, A.ferrooxidans can survive, if the rock <b>retains</b> <b>moisture</b> and the mine is aerated. In fact in this situation, with pioneer microorganisms, the limiting factor {{is likely to be}} the environmental circumneutral pH, which inhibits many acidophiles' growth. However, favourable geochemical conditions quickly develop with an acidic interface between the bacteria and the mineral surface, and pH is lowered to a level closer to acidophilic optimum.|$|R
