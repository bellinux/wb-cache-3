40|$|To provide {{insights}} for the optimization of {{ventilation systems}} for U. S. underground coal mines facing both methane control and spontaneous combustion issues, a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) {{study was conducted to}} model the potential for spontaneous heating in longwall gob areas. A two longwall panel district using a bleeder ventilation system with a stationary longwall face was simulated. The permeability and porosity profiles for the longwall gob were generated from a geotechnical model and were used as inputs for the CFD modeling. In this study, the effect of methane emissions from the mined coal seam, including the longwall face and overlying <b>rider</b> <b>seam</b> reservoirs on the gob gas distribution was considered. The spontaneous heating is modeled as the low-temperature oxidation of coal in the gob using kinetic data obtained from previous laboratory-scale spontaneous-combustion studies. Unsteady state simulations were conducted, and the effects of the coal 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s apparent activation energy and reaction surface area on the spontaneous heating process were also examined. ...|$|E
50|$|The hill lies at {{the heart}} of the South Wales Coalfield and is formed from {{relatively}} flat-lying sandstones of the Pennant Sandstone Formation assigned to the Warwickshire Group, laid down in the late Carboniferous Period. Numerous coal seams within these beds have been worked in the past and the legacy of coalmining is widespread. The important Brithdir and Brithdir <b>Rider</b> <b>seams</b> outcropped along the upper western flanks of the ridge.|$|R
40|$|The study {{considers}} a comprehensive technology (designed and patented by the authors) of developing coal and methane deposits which combines {{in situ gasification}} of lower coalbeds in the suite of rock bump hazardous gassy beds, extraction of coal methane and mechanized mining of coal. The first stage of the technology consists in mining gaseous fuel that enables one to extract up to 15 - 20  % of total energy from the suite of coalbeds. Geodynamic zoning is used to select positions for boring wells. Using the suggested technology {{makes it possible to}} solve a number of tasks simultaneously. First of all that is extracting gaseous fuel from the suite of coalbeds without running any mining works while retaining principal coalbeds in the suite and preparing them for future processing (unloading and degassing). During the first phase the methane-coal deposit works as a gas deposit only, the gas having two sources – extracted methane (which includes its locked forms, absorbed and adsorbed) and the products of partial incineration of thin coalbeds, <b>riders</b> and <b>seams</b> from thee suite. The second stage consists in deep degassing and unloading of coal beds which sharply reduces the hazards of methane explosion and rock bumps, thus increasing the productivity of mechanized coal mining. During the second stage coal is mined in long poles with the account of degassing and unloading of coal beds, plus the data on gas dynamic structure of coal rock massif...|$|R
