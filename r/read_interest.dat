The mosque as a place of worship for Muslims can facilitate the community in getting information through the library. The mosque library in Indonesia is very important, because the Indonesian people are Muslim majority and they have low <b>read</b> <b>interest.</b> The existence of the mosque library did not escape the attention of the National Library of Indonesia as a patrons of libraries in Indonesia. The National Library of Indonesia proclaimed empowerment movement of library to develop <b>read</b> <b>interest</b> society as a manifestation of community education. Empowerment movement of the library is done by building different types of libraries, such as mobile library, school libraries (including boarding school libraries), and a place of worship libraries, one of which is the mosque library. In this paper the mosque libraries that is studied is Masjid Raya Pondok Indah, which is located in South Jakarta and Masjid Istiqlal, in Central Jakarta. The scope of study includes the collections, services, users, librarians, library space, and the development of the library. From observations we can conclude that the mosque libraries have a role in improving the reading interest of Indonesian society, so that the ideals of the nation of Indonesia in the intellectual life of the nation by improving the quality of human resources can be realized...|$|E

To capture these implicit user feedbacks, we use an ordinary web camera and a customized web browser in the setup.

A multi-method design was adapted to assess L 2 reading strategy use and L 2 <b>reading</b> <b>interest.</b> The assessment methods for strategy use included think-aloud protocols and a L 2 reading strategy questionnaire, the Cognitive-Metacognitive Strategy Questionnaire. To quantify the data from the think-aloud protocols, three scoring procedures were developed based on the frequency counts of the strategy coding system: (1) Quantity of Total Strategy Use, (2) Quality of Total Strategy Use and (3) Sophistication of Strategy Use. In addition, the readers' <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> was measured by semi-structural interviews and two interest scales: the Situational Interest Questionnaire and the Interest Experience Scale. Based on the multiple assessments with 36 participants, the study examined (1) the specific L 2 reading strategies employed by eighth graders in Taiwan and how the results from different strategy assessments corresponded to each other, (2) the sources for L 2 <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> for the eighth graders, and (3) how L 2 reading strategy use and <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> interacted with each other to influence L 2 reading comprehension. The results indicated that the L 2 readers utilized three clusters of reading strategies during comprehension: (1) textbase comprehension strategies, such as translation and paraphrasing, (2) situation model construction strategies, such as elaboration, summarization and drawing inferences, and (3) metacognitive monitoring strategies. The study also found that the measure, Sophistication of Strategy Use, had the most satisfactory validity among the strategy measures. The degree of sophistication in strategy use was more associated with the readers' text recalls than the quantity of total strategy use, indicating how the readers intentionally and carefully processed each strategy played a significant role to improve reading comprehension. Moreover, the study found several content characteristics which had positive influences on L 2 readers' interest in the text; they were relevance, importance, novelty and familiarity of the ideas contained in the text. Furthermore, the case analyses on three readers' profiles showed that <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> was closely related to the depth of the readers' strategic engagement. The less proficient L 2 reader, Alice, possessed high <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> and demonstrated an attempt to employ more higher-order, situation model construction strategies during reading. By contrast, the proficient L 2 reader, Stella, did not intend to comprehend the text in depth and utilized the strategies at the superficial level due to low <b>reading</b> <b>interest.</b> These findings presented a dynamic picture of the intertwined relationship between strategy use and <b>reading</b> <b>interest</b> in L 2 reading comprehension...|$|R
