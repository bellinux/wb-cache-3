The proposed procedure, based on the thick-walled cylinder model, allows considering different type of concrete, <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars,</b> transversal reinforcement and geometry of the element analyzed. Starting from the radial stress–strain (σ [...] r –ε [...] r [...]) relationship, the bond-slip (τ [...] b –s) relationship is developed, distinguishing between the two failure modes of splitting of the concrete cover or pull-out of the ribbed bar. Finally, a formulation of the bond-slip is proposed, that considers, not only the concrete mechanical properties, but takes directly account of the concrete cover ratio (c/ϕ [...] b [...]) {{and the percentage of}} transversal reinforcement (ρ [...] s [...]).

These formulations can be extended to non-conforming elements, including members with smooth bars, by means of correction coefficients calibrated on experimental data. These coefficients imply {{a reduction in the}} deformation capacity, which increases if lapping of longitudinal bars is present. The reliability of empirically calibrated coefficients directly depends on the extension of the experimental database, that is, on the number of available tests. The experimental campaign carried out at the University of Naples on 16 real-scale columns with smooth bars allows to extend the experimental database for this typology. Experimental results highlight that rotational capacity of columns with smooth bars is rather large, even higher than the capacity of similar columns reinforced with <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars.</b> This is basically due to the increase in deformability caused by the fixed-end rotation mechanism, particularly exalted when bond capacities are low. Therefore, also based on these results, new correction coefficients are proposed...|$|E

In the present paper, the experimental results of pull-out tests on short anchorages are presented. Several pull-out tests on <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars,</b> embedded in cubes of normal- and high-strength concrete with a concrete cover of 4. 5 times the bar diameter, were carried out {{in order to better}} understand the influence of the relative rib area and bar diameter on the local bond behaviour, {{as well as on the}} splitting crack width generated by the wedging action of ribs. A total of 96 tests were performed on machined bars of three different diameters (12, 16 and 20 mm) with a bond index ranging from 0. 040 to 0. 105. The results of 55 pull-out tests on commercial hot-rolled <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars</b> of four different diameters (12, 20, 40 and 50 mm) are also presented to confirm that the bond response also depends on bar diameter (size effect). Experimental results provide information concerning the influence of the relative rib area on bond strength and on the bursting force due to the rib’s wedge action. As the minimum measured bond strength of rebars was always markedly greater than the minimum bond strength required by building codes even when low bond indexes were adopted, the test results point out the possibility of reducing the minimum value of the relative rib area required by Eurocode 2 without limiting the safety coefficient of bond. The reduction also allows a higher structural ductility that can be achieved due to a greater strain penetration of the rebars from concrete cracks...|$|E

40|$|For {{structural}} utilisation of high-strength concrete, a {{good understanding}} of the bond and anchorage behaviours of <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars</b> in this specific material is essential. The research project aims to increase the knowledge of bond and anchorage behaviours of <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars</b> in high-strength concrete. Furthermore, the validity of the design method in Model Code 1990 aimed for normal strength concrete is investigated. An extensive experimental study was carried out to examine the bond and anchorage behaviour in high-strength concrete compared with that in normal strength concrete. Tests on four types of specimens were conducted. Detail tests and all major anchorage regions (support regions, cut-off regions and splice regions) are treated. For each high-strength concrete specimen tested, a reference specimen of normal strength concrete with the same detailing was also tested. Both simple numerical modelling based on schematic bond stress-slip relationships and more complex non-linear finite element modelling were used to complement the experiments. The study showed that the bond and anchorage behaviours were similar in both concrete types, and governed by the same phenomena. The bond strength in well-confined concrete increased linearly with the concrete compressive strength. Furthermore, high-strength concrete gave a much stiffer local bond stress-slip relationship than normal strength concrete. If the yield capacity of the reinforcing steel was reached, the local bond resistance decreased substantially, especially in high-strength concrete. Schematic local relationships between bond stress and slip are proposed for anchorage in confined normal strength and high-strength concrete; these take into account the bond deterioration when the yield capacity of the reinforcement steel is reached or exceeded. Although the anchorage capacity of a high-strength concrete specimen was higher than that of a comparable normal strength one, the increase was not in proportion to the rise in compressive strength, unlike the local bond strength under well-confined conditions. However, the high-strength concrete showed less capacity for stress redistribution, both along anchorage or lap lengths and between bars anchored in the same region. This can result in premature and brittle failures, unless compensated by a sufficient amount of stirrups. The design method examined usually gave results on the safe side when compared with test results. However, the scatter was large and there was a tendency for the safety to decrease with greater concrete strength...|$|E
40|$|Accelerated bridge {{construction}} techniques allow for bridges to be constructed or replaced more quickly {{in order to}} save commuter time and money. One of these techniques involved the use of prefabricated bridge deck panels, which are connected to each other by high strength closure strips. This thesis report investigates the performance of a closure strip filled with ultra-high performance concrete under fatigue loads at service levels as well as at failure loads. Four nearly full-scale (150 mm deep) bridge deck specimens were constructed, each consisting of two panels connected by a UHPC filled closure strip. Two of the specimens were reinforced with ribbed glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcing bars and the remaining two were reinforced with sand-coated GFRP bars. One specimen fabricated with each bar type was loaded under fatigue (cyclic) loading equivalent to the maximum wheel load specified in the Canadian Highway Bridge Design Code for 2, 000, 000 cycles at three locations: the centre of a precast concrete panel, the centre of the closure strip, and adjacent to the closure strip. The remaining specimen of each bar type was only fatigue tested adjacent to the closure strip at the same load level for 2, 000, 000 cycles. The slabs were then loaded monotonically to failure. It was found that the specimens generally exhibited noticeably increased deflections during initial fatigue loading followed by a more gradual deflection increase {{for the remainder of the}} fatigue loading. The slabs reinforced with the ribbed GFRP bars were found to exhibit significantly larger deflections than the sand-coated bars. The slab with <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars,</b> which was intended to undergo fatigue loading at three locations, experienced failure of the bottom bars during testing at the second fatigue location. Similarly, the specimen with <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars</b> only loaded adjacent to the closure strip also did not complete the planned 2, 000, 000 cycles due to premature failure of the bottom transverse reinforcement. When loaded to failure adjacent to the closure strip, both of the specimens reinforced with the sand-coated GFRP bars experienced a punching shear failure. The punching shear failure surface typically has a cone or pyramidal shape. However, the punching cone for both specimens was truncated by the UHPC closure strip, resulting in a three sided failure cone, with slip occurring along the interface between the precast concrete and the UHPC. The specimens reinforced with <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars</b> were also loaded to failure. However, these specimens failed due to the top fibre of the concrete crushing along the length of the slab due to the lack of bottom reinforcement continuity resulting from the rebar failures during fatigue loading. Finite element models were generated in ABAQUS to provide an understanding of the general stress patterns experienced throughout the slab. The initial load comparison (model vs. measured) yielded similar results, with the model showing slightly more initial stiffness, but cracking at approximately the same load. In addition, the failure loads were compared to two building and bridge code specifications: CSA S 6 and CSA A 23. 3, and it was found that the punching shear failure for the two sand-coated GFRP reinforced specimens was less than the specified values for each of these design codes due to the punching failure occurring on only three sides of the load instead of the four sides assumed by the codes. In conclusion, the specimens with sand-coated reinforcement maintained stiffness throughout fatigue loading and failed in a three-plane punching shear mode, and the specimens with ribbed reinforcement failed during fatigue loading when the bottom transverse reinforcement broke, resulting in significant deflections and pre-empting failure by punching shear...|$|E

The results obtained with the proposed model are compared with the most recent formulations available in the literature and discussed above (Yasojima and Kanakubo 2008; Model Code 2010).|$|R

In such conditions some factors play a key role in modifying maximum tangential stress which can be transferred, for example the variation of the section area of the bar due to the Poisson’s effect, as well as the modification of the geometry of the ribs due to yielding. The proposed formulation has been developed by considering mean parameters, in order to obtain a tool usable also with general-purpose finite element codes. A first series of validation tests have been carried out by means of FE simulations of experimental pull-out tests on long anchored bars.

Generally, normal strength concrete with a density of 2. 4 kg/dm³ and a cylinder compressive strength up to 50 N/mm² is used. In prestressed concrete, the bond anchorage behavior of prestressing strands {{is an important}} constructional element in prefabricated concrete structures and is regulated in DIN 1045 - 1, DIN 4227, Eurocode 2, Model Code 90 and ACI 318 - 02. However, there are no verified experimental design rules for the bond behavior of prestressing forces in high-performance concrete, especially for lightweight and self-compacting concrete. Also, a consistent design concept for the transfer length of prestressing forces is missing. In this work, the applicability of existing rules and standards from literature for the bond anchorage behavior has been investigated for high-performance concrete. Based on these investigations, an own design concept has been developed. The bond anchorage behavior of 7 -wire-strands and 12 mm <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars</b> was investigated in over 400 pull-out-tests, 27 tests for the transfer lengths and eleven beam tests with pretensioned strands in high-strength lightweight concrete and self-compacting concrete. Within the tests, three different types of high-strength lightweight concrete (LC 35 / 38 with rho = 1. 4 kg/dm³, LC 55 / 60 with rho = 1. 6 kg / dm³ and LC 75 / 85 with rho = 1. 8 kg/dm³), and three self-compacting-concrete types (powder-type with fly-ash, powder-type with limestone-powder and combination-type with fly-ash) were tested. At this point, the stress dependent part of 7 -wire strands and 12 mm <b>ribbed</b> <b>bars,</b> {{as well as the}} general bond anchorage behavior in prestressed concrete beams were examined. Based on the experimental test results a modified design approach was developed. Now the code rules for ordinary concrete can be applied to prestressed concrete structures in high-strength lightweight concrete and self-compacting concrete. With these own design proposals to DIN 1045 - 1 and “DAfStb-Richtlinie” for self-compacting concrete, the normative foundations are available. This is the basis to allow a broader application of these concrete types in Germany.

Numerous studies have been already devoted to the study of the chloride threshold value for depassivation of the steel embedded in concrete. One of the reasons found for the scatter is the large number of variables that influence the chloride amount for depassivation.

Originality/value: Production of bimetallic reinforcement bars is very difficult. One from many problems during production bimetallic bars is rolling in the finished passes. In this paper the computer simulation of the rolling bimetallic reinforcement bar is presented...|$|R
