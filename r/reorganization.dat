40|$|In this analysis, {{the authors}} argue that <b>reorganizations</b> symbolize a chief executive’s attempt to {{dominate}} the bureaucracy.

Unlike other students of the subject, Vogelsang-Coombs and Cum-mins do not share the view that the bureaucracy problem can be solved. <b>Reorganizations</b> change the form, but not necessarily the underlying political reality, of public administration...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Burnout is a {{psychological}} reaction triggered by interaction between personal characteristics and stress factors. <b>Reorganizations</b> and downsizing with increased workload imply stress for health-care professionals. This {{is a study}} of burnout in nurses during a period with two comprehensive <b>reorganizations.</b> Methods In this quasi-experimental retrospective cohort study, burnout was assessed in nurses with long work experience in three surveys during a 30 months' period with two comprehensive <b>reorganizations</b> and downsizing of a hospital unit with mostly seriously ill patients with cancer. Burnout was measured with Bergen Burnout Indicator (BBI) at each survey, and "Sense of Coherence" (SOC) with Antonovsky's questionnaire at the last survey. Results One man and 45 women aged 30 to 65 years were invited to the surveys. There was {{a significant increase in}} burnout during the study period, the mean increase in BBI-score was 12. 5 pr year (p Conclusions There was a significant development of burnout in a group of nurses during a period with two <b>reorganizations</b> and downsizing. Burnout was associated with low SOC. Working with seriously ill patients with cancer has probably made the nurses exceptionally vulnerable to the stress and workload related to the <b>reorganizations.</b> </p...|$|R
