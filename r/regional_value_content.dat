40|$|Building on the {{experience}} of NAFTA, and assuming that rules of origin (RoO) negotiated under NAFTA are likely to resemble those that would be agreed upon in an FTAA, this paper discusses how different RoO criteria would affect different Southern partners in a multi-stage production setting. Next, we use a combination of parametric and non-parametric methods to estimate the costs of RoO under NAFTA based on utilization rates and preference margins in the US market. Finally, we carry out illustrative simulations of the margin of preferences that would leave Southern producers indifferent under RoO that force producers to increase <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content...</b>|$|E
40|$|Using {{data on the}} {{preference}} and utilization rates of NAFTA for Mexican exports to the United States in 2001, this chapter proposes a method to estimate the likely costs of different Rules of Origin (ROO) for final and intermediate goods, and compares these results with those obtained using the synthetic index proposed by Estevadeordal (2000). Econometric results indicate that changes in tariff classification are more costly for final goods than for intermediate ones, and that technical requirements are the most constraining. For activities subject to <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content</b> minima, illustrative simulations are carried out to indicate what tariff preference margin {{would be necessary to}} compensate for the import content minima. Cost estimates suggest that, at least in the case of NAFTA, preferential market access is quite small, leading to speculations that these conclusions may carry over to other North-South preferential schemes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} rules of origin {{and their impact on}} trade flows. Four objectives are sought: i) to provide further evidence on the impact on trade of product-specific preferential rules of origin; ii) to develop a restrictiveness index based on empirical findings; iii) to open the path for the impact of the rules of origin on particular sectors other than textiles; and iv) to contribute with further evidence on regime-wide provisions. Literature on rules of origin is reviewed in Chapter 2. While theoretical literature establishes certain conditions under which rules of origin can increase welfare, empirical literature is unanimous about the negative effects they have on trade flows. Two main aspects stem from the review of the empirical literature. First, empirical literature on rules of origin remains still very limited in scope. Second, in order to proxy the stringency of the rules, traditional literature relies on restrictiveness indices based on an ex-ante observation rule. This rule depends on the authors’ appreciation, which can potentially be incorrect. Chapter 3 provides a broad explanation about the different type of product specific and regime-wide rules of origin. The framework {{to assess the impact of}} specific rules and regime-wide provisions on trade flows is developed in Chapter 4. The analysis is conducted using a gravity model of disaggregated panel data for four reporting countries and 16 FTA partners, controlling for reporter and partner fixed effects. In order to account for different ways of modeling specific rules of origin, four different methods are confronted. Data sources and explanations are also provided in this Chapter. Each of the methods is estimated for total trade flows, exports and imports, as a way to improve the validity of the estimates. The results, along some issues regarding the proper form of the specification are presented in Chapter 5. The results prove significant for every specification and suggest that <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content</b> type of rules, as well as self-certification procedures promote trade within the FTAs. Using the estimates from the previous chapter, an ex-post restrictiveness index is constructed in Chapter 6. This index is subsequently used to assess the stringency of the rules of origin by sector and by agreement stringency levels. One of the main differences of this index with past indices is the relatively high level of leniency it assigns to <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content</b> rules. The validity of the ex-post index is checked by estimating the impact of rules of origin on North-South trade as well as on agricultural, industrial and textile imports, finding support on the results. After analyzing the state of play of rules of origin in today’s world, policy recommendations are provided in Chapter 7. There is a practical unanimity on the need to reform the rules of origin as they currently stand. The possibility to choose across-the-board between a <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content</b> rule and current rules, coupled with self-certification procedures appears to address the concerns of researchers, industry and policy makers.

40|$|Preferential market access, {{either in}} the recent OECD {{initiatives}} or in the North-South FTAs {{require the use of}} rules of origin (RoO). Recent studies have questioned the extent of market access provided by these preferences. Using data on Mexican exports to the US in 2001, this paper estimates the likely costs of different RoO for final and intermediate goods, and compares these results with those obtained from a synthetic index. Econometric results are plausible (they satisfy the revealed preference criterion that estimated costs of RoO should be less than preference rates when utilization rates of NAFTA preference are significantly positive), and they indicate that changes in tariff classification are more costly for final goods than for intermediate goods. For activities subject to <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content</b> minima, we carry out illustrative simulations indicating what tariff preference margin would be necessary to compensate for the import content minima. Overall, our cost estimates suggest, that at least in the case of NAFTA, preferential market access was quite small, leading us to speculate that these conclusions may carry over to other North-South preferential schemes.

40|$|Regional trade {{agreements}} (RTAs) provide countries with many benefits. The {{multilateral trading system}} also receives these benefits, as successive and overlapping RTAs are the building blocks for the most viable and realistic path to global free trade. Nonetheless, the spread of criss-crossing RTAs {{in the world has}} generated serious problems, including rising transaction costs. While pursuing the long-term goal of harmonizing preferential rules of origin (ROOs), countries need to actively implement the diagonal or full accumulation system on a sectoral basis, starting from the sectors in which identical product-specific rules among participating countries have been introduced. The adoption of coequality in the change in tariff classification and <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> <b>content</b> (VC) rules also give trading firms more flexibility. If WTO members are able to set up model ROOs, the degree of each RTA's deviation from this benchmark may be calculated and certain modalities for its reduction could be negotiated multilaterally. In the longer term, other systemic rules on top of ROOs need to be converged or harmonized across RTAs on a regional or global basis. The effort to defragment fragmented RTAs should continue even beyond the time when most favoured nation (MFN) tariff rates go down to zero worldwide. Even if all preferential origin regimes shall have become irrelevant by then, various other rules and procedures will still have to be converged and harmonized across RTAs.

40|$|Preferential trade {{agreements}} (PTAs) in the Asia-Pacific region have proliferated rapidly {{over the past}} five years and are creating a complex web of intersecting bilateral and regional {{trade agreements}}. This paper describes the proliferation of these PTAs, discusses their characteristics and implementation, and assesses their potential effects. Realizing the potential gains from Asia-Pacific PTAs requires a commitment to liberalize sensitive sectors, to maintain consistent provisions, and to enforce agreements. Other factors, including administrative complications, also could undermine any potential gains.

This analysis was performed for the main hydrologic regions in the State, and the stations were initially evaluated using a new approach based on entropy analysis. To determine the <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> of each station within a region, several information parameters, including total net information, were defined based on entropy. Stations were ranked based on the total net information. For comparison, the <b>regional</b> <b>value</b> of the same stations was assessed using the generalized least square regression (GLS) method, developed by the US Geological Survey. Finally, a hybrid combination of GLS and entropy was created by including a function of the negative net information as a penalty function in the GLS. The weights of the combined model were determined to maximize the average correlation with the results of GLS and entropy. The entropy and GLS methods were evaluated using the high-flow data from southern Illinois stations.
