25|$|Following {{the opening}} of the nearby radar station at RAF Buchan in 1952, a {{domestic}} camp was opened {{on the site of the}} former railway terminus. The domestic camp was closed in 2005 and the site was sold to a private company. The RAF Buchan operational camp is retained by the Royal Air Force and known as Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Head</b> Buchan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{semi-active}} missile homing <b>radar</b> <b>head</b> (used in 9E420, [...] ) {{as well as}} 9E50M1 for the 9M38M1 missile (9E50 for 9M38) and 1SB4 for Kub missile (...) {{was designed}} by MNII Agate (Zhukovskiy) and manufactured by MMZ at Ioshkar-Ola.|$|E
2500|$|The 9M38 uses a {{single-stage}} X-winged design {{without any}} detachable parts; its exterior design {{is similar to}} the American Tartar and Standard surface-to-air missile series, which led to the half-serious nickname of Standardski. The design had to conform to strict naval dimension limitations, allowing the missile to be adapted for the M-22 SAM system in the Soviet Navy. Each missile is [...] long, weighs [...] and carries a relatively large [...] warhead which is triggered by a radar proximity fuze. In the forward compartment of the missile, a semi-active homing <b>radar</b> <b>head</b> (9E50, [...] ), autopilot equipment, power source and warhead are located. The homing method chosen was proportional navigation. Some elements of the missile were compatible with the Kub's 3M9; for example, its forward compartment diameter (33cm), which was less than the rear compartment diameter.|$|E

50|$|RAF Buchan {{opened in}} 1952 as an Air Defence Radar Unit. As {{part of the}} UK Air Surveillance and Control System, the station {{was one of two}} Control and Reporting Centres (CRC) which {{monitored}} air traffic in and around UK airspace. RAF Buchan was parent station to remote <b>radar</b> <b>heads</b> at Saxa Vord and Benbecula.|$|R
50|$|From around 2000 until 2 April 2004, {{the station}} {{operated}} as RRH Saxa Vord, a Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Head</b> operated from a parent station (RAF Buchan). On 2 April 2004, RAF Saxa Vord was upgraded from a Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Head</b> {{to a full}} manned station, taking {{over control of the}} radar defences in the area. RAF Buchan will be downgraded to a Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Head.</b> RAF Saxa Vord closed in April 2006.|$|E
5000|$|In May 2000 the Ministry of Defence {{announced}} the downgrading of RAF Buchan from a manned station {{to a remote}} <b>radar</b> <b>head.</b> The measure resulted {{in the loss of}} 55 civilian jobs and the transfer of over 200 RAF personnel. Around 92 military and civilian personnel were expected to remain to operate the remote <b>radar</b> <b>head.</b> The radar unit ceased to be a RAF station on 1 September 2004 and the operational part of the station became Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Head</b> Buchan. The separate domestic accommodation site located in Boddam was sold by the Ministry of Defence to a private developer.|$|E
50|$|RRH Staxton Wold is a Royal Air Force Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Head</b> near Scarborough in North Yorkshire, England.|$|E
50|$|Such {{a complex}} system {{required}} that Operators be fully trained. To this end L1 had a large, digital radar simulator that {{was capable of}} generating all the radar inputs of the live system. It was ordered from Elliott Automation following the successful development of the world's first digital radar simulator by that company. Based on the Elliot 502 Computer it could simulate 6 <b>radar</b> <b>heads</b> with jamming and noise while displaying over 200 aircraft.|$|R
5|$|At around 17:00 a large {{formation}} of enemies {{showed up on}} <b>radar</b> <b>headed</b> towards TG38.3. As before, {{a great deal of}} these were shot down by combat air patrol. The surviving enemy planes flew down to the water level to evade further radar detection. These planestorpedo bombers and fighterssuccessfully ambushed the formation just minutes later. Evasive maneuvers, squall weather, and poor fighter cover {{on the part of the}} Japanese helped TG38.3 escape without suffering any significant damage.|$|R
5000|$|At 17:47, TF 17 - {{operating}} under thick overcast [...] west of Takagi - detected the Japanese strike on <b>radar</b> <b>heading</b> in their direction, turned southeast into the wind, and vectored 11 CAP Wildcats, including one piloted by James H. Flatley, to intercept. Taking the Japanese formation by surprise, the Wildcats shot down seven torpedo bombers and one dive bomber, and heavily damaged another torpedo bomber (which later crashed), {{at a cost}} of three Wildcats lost.|$|R

50|$|Soviet {{aircraft}} transiting between Murmansk {{in northern}} Russia and Cuba were routinely intercepted and escorted by live armed fighter aircraft whenever they entered United Kingdom airspace. Following {{the collapse of}} the Warsaw Pact, RAF Buchan took on the executive control of air defence in the UK's northern airspace, reducing RAF Saxa Vord and RAF Benbecula to Remote <b>Radar</b> <b>Heads</b> while Buchan became a Control Reporting Centre. Throughout the remainder of the station's lifetime its role was gradually sidelined in favour of the UK's other Control Reporting Centre at RAF Neatishead.|$|R
50|$|Investigators {{concluded}} that the probable cause of the crash {{was believed to be}} an inoperable instrument landing system and ground <b>radar.</b> The <b>head</b> of Iran's Civil Aviation Authority and five other officials were charged with manslaughter {{as a result of the}} crash of Flight 291.|$|R

25|$|On 8 October 1947, {{the first}} {{launch of a}} test model {{occurred}} from high altitude; however, the rocket unintentionally exploded shortly following it release.

On 10 October 1948, a second rocket was launched, and the speed of Mach 1.38 was obtained in stable level flight, a unique achievement at that time.

500|$|Oliphant {{left the}} Cavendish Laboratory in 1937 {{to become the}} Poynting Professor of Physics at the University of Birmingham. He {{attempted}} to build a [...] cyclotron at the university, but its completion was postponed by {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in Europe in 1939. He became involved with the development of <b>radar,</b> <b>heading</b> a group at the University of Birmingham that included John Randall and Harry Boot. They created a radical new design, the cavity magnetron, that made microwave radar possible. Oliphant also formed part of the MAUD Committee, which reported in July 1941, that an atomic bomb was not only feasible, but might be produced as early as 1943. Oliphant was instrumental in spreading the word of this finding in the United States, thereby starting what became the Manhattan Project. Later in the war, he worked on it with his friend Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley, California, developing electromagnetic isotope separation.|$|R
50|$|Having {{to sit out}} the 2011-12 season due to NCAA by-laws, Benimon flew {{under the}} <b>radar</b> <b>heading</b> in the Colonial Athletic Association's 2012-13 season. He was not even {{selected}} to an All-CAA team during the conference's preseason media day. Benimon burst onto the national scene during his junior year after averaging 17.1 points, 11.2 rebounds, 2.5 assists and 1.9 blocks per game. He was named the CAA Player of the Week four times, its {{player of the year}} {{at the end of the}} regular season, and guided its 17.5-game turnaround from 2011-12 (the biggest turnaround in Division I history) by leading Towson in points, rebounds, assists and blocks. In an early season loss against Temple, Benimon scored 30 points and grabbed 18 rebounds; in an improbable road win against Oregon State, he recorded 20 points and 21 rebounds. Benimon was a top 10 finalist for the Lou Henson Award, given to the nation's best mid-major men's basketball player.|$|R
