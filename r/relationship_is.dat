5|$|After {{discovering}} that Tracy {{is still in}} contact with NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jack realizes that their <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> the key to bringing Tracy back to TGS. Jack, therefore, orders Kenneth to break off all contact with Tracy, although this fails because of Kenneth's relationship with Tracy. Seeing an opportunity, Jack states that since Kenneth's duties were primarily taking care of Tracy, and Tracy no longer works at NBC, Kenneth is no longer needed. Not wanting Kenneth to lose his job, Tracy agrees to return on the stipulation that Kenneth keeps his job.|$|E
5|$|Although many Anahim volcanoes are {{surrounded}} by Chilcotin Group basalt flows, {{the exact nature of}} their <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> unknown. It is unlikely that the Anahim volcanoes ever were a source area for the Chilcotin basalts as they have distinct transitional geochemistries. The Chilcotin Group is interpreted to be related to back-arc extension behind the Cascadia subduction zone.|$|E

5|$|An agency <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> {{between three}} parties - a principal, who authorises an agent {{to make a}} {{contract}} on his behalf with a third party. In agency situations an agent can make a contract with a third party that is binding on the principal, even though he was not privy to the original contract. The right of an agent to make this sort of agreement is found in statute, such as the Consumer Credit Act 1974 which allows a dealer for a financial company to set up credit agreements as a representative of that company.|$|E
5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E
5|$|As a corollary, Nyuserre {{was almost}} {{certainly}} a son of Neferirkare Kakai as Khentkaus II was Neferirkare's queen.

50|$|According to {{cognitive}} dissonance theory, {{there are three}} types of cognitive relationships: consonant relationships, dissonant relationships, and irrelevant <b>relationships.</b> Consonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements, such as your beliefs and actions, are in equilibrium with each other or coincide. Dissonant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements are not in equilibrium and cause dissonance. Irrelevant <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> when two elements do not possess a meaningful relationship with one another, they are unrelated and do not cause dissonance.|$|R

50|$|In {{areas with}} {{significant}} known mineralisation, a data-driven {{approach can be}} adopted in which known deposits are analysed {{in relation to the}} surrounding geology. A number of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests can be used to determine if identified spatial <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> considered statistically significant. Important <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> then spatially quantified over the entire region of interest. Ultimately multiple quantified <b>relationships</b> <b>are</b> combined, typically using a geographic information system (GIS) into a single prospectivity map.|$|R
5|$|Circular {{permutation}} {{can occur}} {{as the result}} of evolutionary events, posttranslational modifications, or artificially engineered mutations. The two main models proposed to explain the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are permutation by duplication and fission and fusion. Permutation by duplication occurs when a gene undergoes duplication to form a tandem repeat, before redundant sections of the protein are removed; this <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> found between saposin and swaposin. Fission and fusion occurs when partial proteins fuse to form a single polypeptide, such as in nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenases.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} average length of the human menstrual cycle {{is similar to that of}} the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no {{relation}} between the two.

A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle.|$|E

5|$|Foliot was {{probably}} the son of Robert Foliot—steward to David, Earl of Huntingdon, heir to the Scottish throne—and Robert's wife Agnes, sister of Robert de Chesney, Bishop of Lincoln. Whatever his parentage, Gilbert was certainly Robert de Chesney's nephew; another of his uncles, Reginald, was a monk of Gloucester Abbey and Abbot of Evesham Abbey. Other ecclesiastics in his family included Robert Foliot, a later Bishop of Hereford perhaps from an Oxford branch of the family, and two earlier Bishops of London, Richard de Beaumis the elder and Richard de Beaumis the younger, Gilbert also referred to Richard of Ilchester, later Bishop of Winchester, as a kinsman, but the exact <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> unknown. William de Chesney, a partisan of Stephen's and a leading Oxfordshire layman, was another of Foliot's uncles, and Miles of Gloucester, Earl of Hereford, was a cousin. In about 1145 Foliot intervened to secure {{the release of a}} knight to whom he was related, Roger Foliot, but their precise <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> unknown.|$|E

5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the <b>relationship</b> <b>is</b> called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E

40|$|The {{joint control}} of rate of key pecking in pigeons by stimulus-reinforcer and response-reinforcer <b>relationships</b> <b>was</b> {{studied in the}} context of a two-component {{multiple}} schedule of reinforcement.
