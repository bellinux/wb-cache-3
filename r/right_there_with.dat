500|$|Scheyer was a 2006 Inductee {{into the}} National Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. [...] Jonah Keri wrote for ESPN in 2007: [...] "Scheyer, is an honest-to-goodness M.O.T. If he {{continues}} to develop his Redick Lite repertoire, he could eventually {{become one of the}} all-time great Jewish basketball stars, <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> Dolph Schayes".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with MTV News, Bernthal stated that Walsh was suffering from the [...] "loneliness you feel when you're <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> them and you can't be {{with them in the}} way you want." [...] Bernthal applauded the writers for such changes, and felt that the storyline never devitalized. [...] "The people that Shane loved more {{than anyone else in the}} world before the apocalypse are still very much alive and still very much with him, but he'll never be with them in the way he wants to and the way he once was. Every relationship—Shane/Carl, Shane/Lori and Shane/Rick—it's tainted and fractured. When you suffer from that kind of loneliness, it brings out the worst in you." ...|$|E
500|$|Underwood {{was created}} to give Carter a [...] "strong female antagonist", and Butters noted that [...] "we said, wouldn’t it be great {{to have one of}} those people who is living <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> her be {{actually}} a bad guy?" [...] In late January 2015, Butters and Fazekas revealed that Underwood is a product of the precursor to the Black Widow program. Regan did not know the character was a Black Widow when auditioning, but quickly learned after being cast, as the showrunners wanted her to change her then current red hair, in order to avoid being [...] "a tip to the audience, because of Natasha [...] They didn’t want to imply that every Black Widow had red hair and they didn’t want the audience to see it coming." [...] Regan trained with a Tae Kwan Do expert and studied Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow choreography from the films in preparation for the character's fight scenes, while Ottobre-Melton referenced her Black Widow status by using the colors red and black. Underwood's initial [...] "small-town girl from Iowa" [...] persona was based on Judy Garland's Dorothy Gale from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

2500|$|Black {{nationalist}} Malcolm X, in his Message to the Grass Roots speech, {{criticized the}} march, describing it as [...] "a picnic" [...] and [...] "a circus". He said {{the civil rights}} leaders had diluted the original purpose of the march, which had been to show the strength and anger of black people, by allowing white people and organizations to help plan {{and participate in the}} march. One SNCC staffer commented during the march, [...] "He's denouncing us as clowns, but he's <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the clown show." [...] But the membership of SNCC, increasingly frustrated with the tactics of the NAACP and other moderate groups, gradually embraced Malcolm X's position.|$|E
2500|$|Jamie Todd Rubin, {{reviewing}} {{the issue of}} Astounding in which the story originally appeared, writes [...] "f all the stories in the issue, de Camp’s is the best written. There is no feeling of pulp writing or story-telling. It is a smooth tale that comes alive in your imagination so that {{you feel like you}} are <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the characters on their journey. Abou the only weakness in the story was the ending, which returns to the father and his adopted son. I didn’t think the ending lived up to the full potential of the story, and almost would have liked to seen the beginning and ending left off, and just go on the wonderful journey through the African wilderness." ...|$|E
2500|$|Maezumi was {{forthcoming}} in admitting {{his mistakes}} {{and did not}} justify his behaviors. These events caused much turmoil in his school, and many students left as a result. Some members who stayed described themselves as forced to see Maezumi on a more human level, even seeing this period as a breakthrough for them, no longer deluded into thinking a teacher could be beyond imperfection. Both Bays and Tetsugen Bernard Glassman founded their own sanghas at this time. When remembering Maezumi, author David Chadwick had this to say: [...] "I'd say he had an interesting mix of humility and arrogance. Mainly to me he'd seem arrogant at a distance, but close up he'd be <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> me not putting on any airs." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Be-Bop Deluxe is {{redeemed}} by {{the brilliance}} of band's playing, and particularly Nelson's guitar playing. His records put Nelson <b>right</b> up <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the other great masters of the electric guitar." ...|$|R

2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... {{features}} dialogue-driven interludes in {{the beginning}} of several tracks with Raekwon and Ghostface Killah conversing about money, life, crime, and hip hop, among other things. The introduction to [...] "Glaciers of Ice," [...] for instance, involves Ghostface addressing his plans and methods of dyeing Wallabee-styled Clarks. In a 2005 interview, Ghostface Killah explained [...] "We was in the car one day, driving around with the DAT machine with a microphone and we just started talking shit about how we're gonna do it this summer with the Clarks. The dyeing was something I was doing already. I'm an inventor. Niggas can't fuck with me when it comes to style. Only nigga that is <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> me is probably Slick Rick. Other than that, I'm boss." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{pointed out to me}} that many [...] protesters are non-white and/or [...] "communists." [...] Well my answer to that is: [...] "Who cares?!" [...] They are against the same evil, corrupted, {{degenerate}} capitalist elitists that we are against! ...Seriously people, just who is our enemy? [...] The unemployed left-wing 25-year-old holding up a sign, or the Judeo-capitalist banksters who swindled the American taxpayers out of a trillion dollars in the [...] "bailout" [...] scam and continue to oppress the white working class?!? ... We need to utilize and support every movement of dissent against this evil American empire, regardless of which end of the political spectrum it originates from. ...The fact that it's these [...] "lefties" ... who are picking up the ball and running with it – only shows how much more in tune they are with the fed up masses of white workers, than the fossilized, reactionary [...] "right-wing". ... My heart is <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> these people, perhaps someday the [...] "movement" [...] will show the same courage and dedication that these people out there fighting are showing! ...|$|E

6000|$|... "And now," [...] he went on, not {{permitting}} the pause to grow awkward, [...] "we-all {{might as well}} have an accounting. I'm pullin' West this afternoon on that blamed Twentieth Century." [...] He tugged at his grip, got it open, and dipped into it with both his hands. [...] "But don't forget, boys, when you-all want me to hornswoggle Wall Street another flutter, all you-all have to do is whisper the word.

6000|$|... "We'll {{bring you}} good men in legions; we'll take out your {{high-grade}} ore, but you'll {{remember that the}} building of this railroad wasn't all luxury.

There were considerable of them, but most of you know this one--I'm sharing my laurels with him--" [...] and as a thunder of applause which followed the halt he made died away he turned toward me.

60|$|You {{know how}} it is when you get an idea. For awhile it sort of simmers inside you, and then {{suddenly}} it sizzles up like a rocket, and there you are, right up against it. That's what happened now. I went away from that luncheon, vaguely determined to pull off some stunt which would prove that I was <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> the gray matter, but without any clear notion of what I was going to do. Side by side with this in my mind was the case of dear old Harold. When I wasn't brooding on the stunt, I was brooding on Harold. I was fond of the good old lad, and I hated the idea of his slowly wrecking the home purely by being a chump. And {{all of a sudden the}} two things clicked together like a couple of chemicals, and there I was with a corking plan for killing two birds with one stone--putting one across that would startle and impress Ann, and at the same time healing the breach between Harold and Hilda.|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm {{going to}} get my hands on some of that water front and the tide-lands. Take between where I'm going to build my pier and the old pier. It's shallow water. I can fill and dredge and put in a system of docks that will handle {{hundreds}} of ships. San Francisco's water front is congested. No more room for ships. With hundreds of ships loading and unloading on this side right into the freight cars of three big railroads, factories will start up over here instead of crossing to San Francisco. That means factory sites. That means me buying in the factory sites before anybody guesses the cat is going to jump, much less, which way. Factories mean tens of thousands of workingmen and their families. That means more houses and more land, and that means me, for I'll be there to sell them the land. And tens of thousands of families means tens of thousands of nickels every day for my electric cars. The growing population will mean more stores, more banks, more everything. And that'll mean me, for I'll be <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> business property as well as home property. What do you think of it?" ...|$|E
5000|$|That {{documentary}} encapsulated {{the idea}} of films being a form of social protest for me, and that's something that didn't even dawn on me until I was much older. It started <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>with</b> that film.|$|E
