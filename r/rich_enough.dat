5|$|To address {{concerns}} that {{the sound of the}} Hammond was not <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> to accurately mimic a pipe organ, the model BC was introduced in December 1936. It included a chorus generator, in which a second tonewheel system added slightly sharp or flat tones to the overall sound of each note. The cabinet was made deeper to accommodate this. Production of the old Model A cases stopped, but the older model continued to be available as the AB until October 1938.|$|E

The family was an aristocratic one that was no longer <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> to fraternise with their former academic peers, leaving Brian (too proud to fraternise with lower classes) a lonely child who immersed himself in the study of physics.|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} psycho-physical parallelism, superpositions appear <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> {{to represent}} primitive conscious awareness. It seems that quantum superpositions {{have never been}} considered, for example, in neuronal models, since only classical states of deﬁnite neuronal excitation are usually taken into account. These quasi-classical states are also measured by external neurobiologists. Quantum theory would admit their superpositions, too, thus giving rise to a far greater variety of physical states which may be experienced by the subjective observer. When used for information processing, such superpositions would now be called “quantumbits” or qubits. As demonstrated by M. Tegmark, {{they can not be}} relevant for neuronal and similar processes in the brain.|$|E

BSAC was assured {{that there would}} be much traffic from its lead and zinc mines, but this did not {{materialise}} because technical mining problems. The railway could not meet the costs of the construction loans, and the company faced major financial problems, which were already serious because of the cost of widening the Beira railway. The only area likely to generate sufficient mineral traffic to relieve these debts was Katanga. Initially, the Congo Free State had concluded that Katanga's copper deposits were not <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> to justify the capital cost of building a railway to the coast, but expeditions between 1899 and 1901 proved their value. Copper deposits found in Northern Rhodesia before the First World War proved uneconomic to develop.|$|E

25|$|The King's finance minister, Turgot, {{tried to}} reform the {{finances}} of the state, reducing state expenses and freeing the prices of grain from state control. Speculation on grain prices drove the price of bread up, leading to bread riots in Paris on 3 May 1775. After supporting Turgot, in 1776 the King dismissed him and refused to make any further major fiscal reforms. The King also lost much of his support within the army. In 1781, the minister of the Army, Ségur, decided that any candidate to be an army officer had to show four degrees of nobility, blocking any path of advancement for talented but non-noble officers. Even noble officers had to be <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> to pay a large sum for their promotion. When the Revolution came, the non-noble and less-wealthy officers abandoned the King and joined the Revolutionaries. By August 1788, the government {{had run out of}} money, and gave soldiers and government workers and contractors notes promising to pay, rather than cash. Riots broke out, and customs posts all over Paris were attacked and burned. The King gave way and appointed the Swiss-born banker and reformist, Jacques Necker, as his new finance minister.|$|E
25|$|Rule 110, {{like the}} Game of Life, {{exhibits}} what Wolfram calls class 4 behavior, which is neither completely random nor completely repetitive. Localized structures appear and interact in various complicated-looking ways. In {{the course of}} the development of A New Kind of Science, as a research assistant to Wolfram in 1994, Matthew Cook proved that some of these structures were <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> to support universality. This result is interesting because rule 110 is an extremely simple one-dimensional system, and difficult to engineer to perform specific behavior. This result therefore provides significant support for Wolfram's view that class 4 systems are inherently likely to be universal. Cook presented his proof at a Santa Fe Institute conference on Cellular Automata in 1998, but Wolfram blocked the proof from being included in the conference proceedings, as Wolfram did not want the proof announced before the publication of A New Kind of Science. In 2004, Cook's proof was finally published in Wolfram's journal Complex Systems (Vol. 15, No. 1), over ten years after Cook came up with it. Rule 110 has been the basis for some of the smallest universal Turing machines.|$|E
25|$|Hamilton {{was widely}} lauded for his daring feat. The House of Assembly in Jamaica awarded him a £300 sword. King George III created him a Knight Bachelor on 1 February 1800. Hamilton also {{received}} a Naval Gold Medal for the action. He was also voted a freeman of the City of London on 6 March 1800, {{which was to be}} awarded him in a gold box with a value of 50 guineas. The wounded Hamilton was sent home to recover aboard the Jamaica packet, but on her voyage she was captured by the French and Hamilton was taken prisoner. He was sent to Paris, where he seems to have come to the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte. Hamilton spent six months in prison, before being released and repatriated, having been exchanged for four French midshipmen. He finally made it to London, in time to be present at a special banquet held by the Court of Common Council of the City of London to celebrate the anniversary of his cutting out of the Hermione. Here he received his gold box and the freedom of the city. He was also offered a pension of £300 a year for his wounds, which he turned down. He was both <b>rich</b> <b>enough</b> from his prize money not to need the pension, and also feared that taking it might be used as an excuse not to give him active employment again.|$|E
