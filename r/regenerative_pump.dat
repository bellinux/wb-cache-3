50|$|Most turbopumps have a Holweck pump (or {{molecular}} drag pump) {{as their}} last stage {{to increase the}} maximum backing pressure (exhaust pressure) to about 1-10 mbar. Theoretically, a centrifugal pump, a side channel pump, or a <b>regenerative</b> <b>pump</b> {{could be used to}} back to atmospheric pressure directly, but currently there is no commercially available turbopump that exhausts directly to atmosphere. In most cases, the exhaust is connected to a mechanical backing pump (usually called roughing pump) that produces a pressure low enough for the turbomolecular pump to work efficiently. Typically, this backing pressure is below 0.1 mbar and commonly about 0.01 mbar. The backing pressure is rarely below 10−3 mbar (mean free path ≈ 70 mm) because the flow resistance of the vacuum pipe between the turbopump and the roughing pump becomes significant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} rapid manufacture used {{in the development of}} a <b>regenerative</b> <b>pump</b> impeller. Rapid manufacturing technology was used to create complex impeller blade profiles for testing as part of a <b>regenerative</b> <b>pump</b> optimisation process. Regenerative pumps are the subject of increased interest in industry. Ten modified impeller blade profiles, from the standard radial configuration, were evaluated with the use of computational fluid dynamics and experimental testing. Prototype impellers were needed for experimental validation of the CFD results. The manufacture of the complex blade profiles using conventional milling techniques is a considerable challenge for skilled machinists. The complexity of the modified blade profiles would normally necessitate the use of expensive CNC machining with 5 axis capability. With an impeller less than 75 mm in diameter and a maximum blade thickness of 1. 3 mm, a rapid manufacturing technique enabled production of complex blade profiles that were dimensionally accurate and structurally robust enough for testing. As more advanced rapid prototyping machines become available in the study in the future, e. g. 3 D photopolymer jetting machine, the quality of the parts particularly in terms of surface finish will improve and the amount of post processing operations will reduce. This technique offers the possibility to produce components of increased complexity whilst ensuring quality, strength, performance and speed of manufacture. The ability to manufacture complex blade profiles that are robust enough for testing, in a rapid and cost effective manner is proving essential in the overall design optimisation process for the pump...|$|E
40|$|The <b>regenerative</b> <b>pump</b> {{is a kind}} of {{turbomachine}} that {{is capable}} of developing a high pressure rise at relatively low flow rates compared to the centrifugal and axial pumps. Although the efficiency of regenerative pumps is much lower than other turbomachines, they have still been widely used in many industrial applications for high heads at low flow rates. There are a few theoretical models to analyze the performance of regenerative pumps, though, the effect of the blade angle has not been included in any analysis model to date. In this study, the influence of the impeller blade angle and its shape on <b>regenerative</b> <b>pump</b> performance has been experimentally investigated. Straight blades with inclined blade angles of 0, 15, 30 and 45 were tested. In addition radial chevron impellers with chevron angles of 15, 30 and 45 were also included in the present experiments. Hence a total of 10 blade configurations were examined. The pressure head, efficiency and the fluid temperature rise were measured at different flow rates and the results were expressed in appropriate non-dimensional coefficients. From the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} pressure head and the efficiency strongly depend on the blade angles as well as the blade geometry. Among all blade configurations tested in this study, the chevron blade exhibited the highest head with reasonably good efficiency. The comparative study shows that there is an optimum chevron angle of around 30 that yields the best performance. These experimental data may be used to include the effect of blade angles in the current performance analysis and design models to widen their applicability...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a multi-mJ, few-cycle, absolute-phase controlled laser system based on optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (OPCPA) operating at a kHz repetition rate. A laser system with these specifications will provide a table-top platform to enable a broad range of experiments in demanding research areas, including laser electron acceleration and the creation of exotic highenergy density plasmas from solid targets. The approach of the work is a combination of both experimental effort and numerical simulations used to guide and aid interpretation of laboratory studies. The non-collinear parametric gain stages of the laser have been optimised using detailed numerical simulations. A comparison is given on phase matching conditions in BBO and LBO crystals along with a novel nonlinear material BiBO. The production of 600 μJ pulses with a bandwidth that supports a transform limited temporal duration of 8. 5 fs is presented in a three stage BBO based design. An all optical, low-jitter synchronisation scheme for the OPCPA pump and signal pulses has been designed and implemented by use of solitonic wavelength shifting in a photonic crystal fiber (PCF). Commercially available fibers with various core sizes have been assessed. The propagation of few-cycle pulses in the PCF has been studied by numerically solving the generalised Schr¨odinger equation with the splitstep Fourier method. An OPA pump laser with excellent spatial and temporal qualities has been developed.
