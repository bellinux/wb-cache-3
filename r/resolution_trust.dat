40|$|Abstract – This paper {{introduces}} {{the concept of}} asserted resolution as a technique for entity resolution. In asserted <b>resolution</b> <b>trusted</b> information sources are used to force the equivalence (or non-equivalence) of entity references and identity structures regardless of matching conditions. The paper proposes five specific forms of assertion to support entity identity information management, the process of storing and maintaining identity information in an information system so that references to an entity can be recognized and labeled with the same identifier over time. The paper also gives {{a description of the}} way in which asserted resolution is being implemented in the OYSTER open source entity resolution system...|$|R
40|$|Managing {{violence}} {{is an important}} clinical and managerial responsibility within contemporary mental health practice {{and there have been}} considerable developments across the country {{to pave the way for}} a more ‘standardised’ approach to conflict <b>resolution.</b> Many <b>trusts</b> employ someone to lead on ‘conflict resolution’ but the precise nature of the lead role and the responsibility attached to it vary greatly between organisations. Similarly, some trusts have sophisticated systems for delivering and monitoring conflict training and updates, whereas others do not. The project described here sought to clarify how training for conflict resolution is organised within a sample of mental health trusts in England. Data was generated by questionnaire and telephone interview with trust leads, and the audit findings were then analysed and used to inform an inter-professional training pilot in one local trust. It is now expected that frontline staff will enter into conflict resolution training as defined by the NHS Security Management Service (2004) and be trained in accordance with a national syllabus of training standards. Audited opinion suggests that the training co-ordinator role is associated with improved governance in relation to conflict-resolution training. Arguably, if national benchmarks and standards are to be met in relation to conflict <b>resolution,</b> <b>trusts</b> need to invest in training infrastructure and at least consider the merits of funding a dedicated co-ordinator role and inter-professional training...|$|R
40|$|Credential- {{evidence}} used {{to prove}} identity or access rights. Certificate- a digitally signed statement associating {{a set of}} attributes with a public key. Most frequently used to associate a public key with a virtual or real identity (i. e., identity certificate). Authentication- the process of establishing the identity of an on-line entity. Authorization- the process of establishing the set of rights associated with an entity. Trusted third party- an entity mutually trusted (typically by two end-points) to assert authenticity or authorization, or perform conflict <b>resolution.</b> <b>Trusted</b> third parties are also often used to aid in secret negotiation (e. g., cryptographic keys).

25|$|In 1979, McAuliffe had met Richard Swann, {{a lawyer}} {{who was in charge}} of {{fundraising}} for Jimmy Carter's presidential campaign in Florida. In 1988, McAuliffe married Swann's daughter, Dorothy. McAuliffe invested $800,000 in Swann's American Pioneer Savings Bank, which was taken over In 1990 by federal regulators, causing Swann to file for bankruptcy. The <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation, a federal agency, took over American Pioneer's assets and liabilities. Under Swann's guidance, McAuliffe purchased some of American Pioneer's real estate from the <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation. McAuliffe's equal partner in the deal was a pension fund controlled by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) and the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA). They purchased real estate valued at $50 million for $38.7 million; McAuliffe received a 50% equity stake. The deal was arranged by Jack Moore, a NECA trustee and acquaintance of McAuliffe. Next, McAuliffe acquired a distressed house-building company, American Heritage Homes, which had been buying real estate formerly owned by American Pioneer. McAuliffe served as chairman of American Heritage along with CEO Carl H. Linder. The Florida-based company came out of distress under a plan in which it built 800 homes a year.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), {{a federal}} {{government}} agency that insured S accounts {{in the same way}} the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures commercial bank accounts, then had to repay all the depositors whose money was lost. From 1986 to 1989, FSLIC closed or otherwise resolved 296 institutions with total assets of $125 billion.

25|$|Starr {{took the}} {{position}} part-time and remained active with his law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, {{as this was}} permitted by statute and was also the norm with previous independent counsel investigations. As time went on, however, Starr was increasingly criticized for alleged conflicts of interest stemming from his continuing association with Kirkland & Ellis. Kirkland, like several other major law firms, was representing clients in litigation with the government, including tobacco companies and auto manufacturers. The firm itself was being sued by the <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Company, a government agency involved in the Whitewater matter. Additionally, Starr's own actions were challenged because Starr had, on one occasion, talked with lawyers for Paula Jones, who was suing Bill Clinton over an alleged sexual assault. Starr had explained to them why he believed that sitting U.S.presidents are not immune to civil suit.|$|E

A third case {{filed by the}} <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation resulted in a summary judgment of $4.3 billion against Keating and his wife in 1994, the largest judgment ever against a private person. The judgment was overturned on appeal in 1999, on grounds that Keating could not be held personally liable to the government without a specific criminal conviction or some other decision at trial. [...] Throughout his incarceration, Keating maintained his innocence, saying he was a [...] "political prisoner" [...] of the U.S. government and a scapegoat for the largest banking scandal in the nation's history.|$|E
500|$|Early on, Apollo made a {{name for}} itself by {{acquiring}} interests in companies that Drexel had helped finance by purchasing high-yield bonds from failed savings and loans and insurance companies. [...] Apollo acquired several large portfolios of assets from the U.S. government's <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation. [...] One of Apollo's earliest and most successful deals involved the acquisition of Executive Life Insurance Company's bond portfolio. [...] Using this vehicle, Apollo would purchase the Executive Life portfolio, generating tremendous profits when the value of high yield bonds recovered, but also resulting in a variety of state regulatory issues for Apollo and Credit Lyonnais over the purchase. More than a decade after the purchase, in 2002, California Attorney General Bill Lockyer accused Apollo, Leon Black, and an investor group led by French bank Credit Lyonnais, of illegally acquiring the assets and bond portfolio of Executive Life Insurance Co. in 1991. [...] According to the State of California, Lion allegedly violated a California law that prohibited foreign government-owned banks from owning California insurance companies.|$|E

40|$|In {{non-repudiation}} services where digital signatures usually {{serve as}} irrefutable cryptographic evidence for dispute <b>resolution,</b> <b>trusted</b> time-stamping and certificate revocation services, although very costly in practice, must be available, to prevent big loss due to compromising of the signing key. In [11], {{a new concept}} called intrusion-resilient signature was proposed {{to get rid of}} trusted time-stamping and certificate revocation services and a concrete scheme was presented. In this paper, we put forward a new scheme that can achieve the same effect in a much more efficient way. In our scheme, forward-secure signature serves as a building block that enables signature validation without trusted time-stamping, and a one-way hash chain is employed to control the validity of public-key certificates without the CA's involvement for certificate revocation. We adopt a model similar to the intrusion-resilient signature in [11], where time is divided into predefined short periods and a user has two modules, signer and home base. The signer generates forward-secure signatures on his own while the home base manages the validity of the signer's public-key certificate with a one-way hash chain. The signature verifier can check the validity of signatures without retrieving the certificate revocation information from the CA. Our scheme is more robust in the sense that loss of synchronization between the signer and the home base could be recovered in the next time period while it is unrecoverable in [11]. To facilitate the implementation of our signature validation scheme, we further present a new forward-secure signature scheme which is more efficient than all of the existing forward-secure signature schemes...|$|R
2500|$|A {{week earlier}} that same December, the {{existing}} CRA statute was amended once again upon {{the enactment of}} the <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation Refinancing, Restructuring, and Improvement Act of 1991.

Upon the addition of section 808 (...) to the existing CRA statutes by the Act, any depository institution which donated, sold with favorable terms (as determined by the appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency), or made available on a rent-free basis any branch of such institutions located in any predominantly minority neighborhood to any minority depository institution or women's depository institution, the amount of the contribution or the amount of the loss incurred in connection with such activity would go towards meeting the credit needs of the institution's community and would be taken into consideration when CRA examinations were evaluated.|$|E

[...] L.

2500|$|The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) {{had been}} created to insure {{deposits}} held by savings and loan institutions ("S", or [...] "thrifts"). [...] Because of a confluence of events, much of the S industry was insolvent, and many large banks were in trouble as well. [...] FSLIC's reserves were insufficient {{to pay off the}} depositors of all of the failing thrifts, and fell into insolvency. [...] FSLIC was abolished in August 1989 and replaced by the <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation (RTC). [...] On December 31, 1995, the RTC was merged into the FDIC, and the FDIC became responsible for resolving failed thrifts. Supervision of thrifts became the responsibility of a new agency, the Office of Thrift Supervision (credit unions remained insured by the National Credit Union Administration). The primary legislative responses to the crisis were the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA). Federally chartered thrifts are now regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and state-chartered thrifts by the FDIC.|$|E

40|$|The {{interaction}} between immigrants {{and members of}} the host society has been and still is an important issue during processes of migration. This study analyses inter-ethnic aggressive antisocial actions among adolescents. A descriptive analysis reveals the frequency of such behaviour among German, Turkish and Resettler (Aussiedler) adolescents. The explanatory analysis concentrates on the influence of a) attitudes towards violence (justifications), b) an approval with social dominance, c) bargaining as a conflict resolution strategy, and d) trust in the judicial system (a fair treatment according to the law). It is assumed that justifications for violent behaviour and the approval with social dominance are likely to increase inter-ethnic aggressive antisocial actions. In contrast, bargaining as a preference for conflict <b>resolution</b> and <b>trust</b> in the judicial system are supposed to reduce such behaviour. A final comparison reveals whether the explanations are substantial across the groups...|$|R
2500|$|Perelman {{jumped back}} into the savings & loan game {{in a big way}} in 1994 by buying First Nationwide from the Ford Motor Company for $664 million. [...] Ford held onto $1.8 billion of First Nationwide's assets valued at $444 million, two-thirds of which were {{considered}} troubled assets, offered to buy back up to $500 million of First Nationwide's other $7.9 billion of assets that went bad in the future, and gave Perelman $50 million to cover potential severance payments. [...] Perelman quickly boosted its portfolio, adding $10 billion worth of mortgages in exchange for a $175 million payment to <b>Resolution</b> <b>Trust</b> Corporation. [...] Before 1995 ended, Perelman added two more thrifts to his collective: SFFed's $4.1 billion of assets for $250 million and Home Federal Financial's $735 million of assets and $662 million of deposits for $70.6 million. [...] Just as quickly as he added assets, branches, and deposits in California, he dumped what he had elsewhere in the country. In 1995 alone he sold off 79 branches with $4.3 billion in deposits spread out across five states. 1996 went a little slower, but not eventfully. He acquired California Federal Bancorp for $1.2 billion, creating the 4th largest thrift in the country with $32.3 billion in assets. In 1997, another $3.3 billion in mortgages were added courtesy of WMC Mortgage but it was an otherwise quiet year for First Nationwide. In 1998, Perelman negotiated a stock swap with Golden State Bancorp to create the third largest thrift in the country with $50 billion of assets. The deal left Golden State's shareholders the majority, but Perelman's camp still controlled the company. Everything remained quiet until May 2002 when Citigroup announced plans to buy Golden State for $5.8 billion, but ultimately reduced the offer to $4.9 billion due to a stock drop. Citigroup's final offer was 0.821 shares of Citigroup common stock and $7.47 cash for every share of Golden State exchanged, which converted Perelman's 43 million shares of Golden State into $321,210,000 in cash plus 36,124,000 shares of Citigroup. All things considered, Perelman expected to make about $2 billion off the deal, but because he had quasi-sold many of his shares in the past, he probably gained substantially less than that.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{proposition}} that love promotes commitment, the authors predicted that love would motivate approach, have a distinct signal, and correlate with commitment-enhancing processes when relationships are threatened. The authors studied romantic partners and adolescent opposite-sex friends during interactions that elicited love and threatened the bond. As expected, the experience of love correlated with approach-related states (desire, sympathy). Providing evidence for a nonverbal display of love, four affiliation cues (head nods, Duchenne smiles, gesticulation, forward leans) correlated with self-reports and partner estimates of love. Finally, the experience and display of love correlated with commitment-enhancing processes (e. g., constructive conflict <b>resolution,</b> perceived <b>trust)</b> when the relationship was threatened.
