As computing became more widespread and useful in the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the concept of [...] "medical software" [...] as a data and operations management tool in the medical industry — including in the physician's office — became more prevalent. Medical software became more prominent in medical devices in fields such as nuclear medicine, cardiology, and medical robotics by the early 1990s, prompting additional scrutiny of the [...] "safety-critical" [...] nature of medical software in the research and legislative communities, in part fueled by the Therac-25 <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>device</b> scandal. The development of the ISO 9000-3 standard as well as the European Medical Devices Directive in 1993 helped bring some harmonization of existing laws with medical devices and their associated software, and the addition of IEC 62304 in 2006 further cemented how medical device software should be developed and tested. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has also offered guidance and driven regulation on medical software, particularly embedded in and used as medical devices.|$|E

30|$|An {{application}} {{on which}} PET/CT is also {{having an impact}} is that of radiotherapy treatment planning [14]. In anticipation of application to radiotherapy treatment planning, the patient port on early PET/CT designs was increased to 70  cm in diameter. From the beginning, PET/CT provided more convenient and routine access to fused CT and PET images and early assessment {{of the consequences of}} using PET/CT in planning [15] was encouraging. As suggested, the convenience of having fused CT and PET images for every patient immediately following the PET/CT could not be matched by even the most sophisticated software. Increasingly, PET/CT systems are being acquired by radiation oncology departments and PET images are contributing directly to the definition of treatment volumes on CT-based plans [16, 17]. This will continue to be an area of growth, particularly in meeting the demands of intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (IMRT) and the availability of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>devices</b> able to treat tumours with surgical precision using sophisticated robotic techniques. Access to other PET biomarker mapping processes, such as hypoxia [18], that increase the radio-resistance of tumours could potentially expand the role of PET in radiation oncology.

40|$|Radiation therapy {{typically}} {{begins with}} the acquisition of a CT scan of the patient for planning, followed by multiple days where radiation is delivered according to the plan. This requires that the patient be reproducibly positioned (set up) on the <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>device</b> (linear accelerator) such that the radiation beams pass through the target. Modern linear accelerators provide cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging, {{but this does not}} provide sufficient contrast to discriminate many abdominal soft-tissue targets and therefore patient setup is often done by aligning bony anatomy or implanted fiducials. Ultrasound (US) can be used to both assist with patient setup and to provide real-time monitoring of soft-tissue targets. One challenge, however, is that the ultrasound probe contact pressure can deform the target area and cause discrepancies with the treatment plan. Another challenge is that radiation therapists typically do not have ultrasound experience and therefore cannot easily find the target in the US image. We propose cooperative control strategies to address both challenges. First, we use cooperative control with virtual fixtures (VFs) to enable acquisition of a planning CT that includes the soft-tissue deformation. Then, for the patient setup during the treatment sessions, we propose to use real-time US image feedback to dynamically update the VFs; this co-manipulation strategy provides haptic cues that guide the therapist to correctly place the US probe. A phantom study is performed to demonstrate that the co-manipulation strategy enables inexperienced operators to quickly and accurately place the probe on a phantom to reproduce a desired reference image. This is a necessary step for patient setup and, by reproducing the reference image, creates soft-tissue deformations that are consistent with the treatment plan, thereby enabling real-time monitoring during treatment delivery...|$|E
40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 11, 2014). Radiation therapy {{accounts}} {{for more than half of}} cancer treatments in the US, and in order to provide the most effective treatment to patients, new developments are implemented each year. Before a novel <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>device</b> or technique can be used to treat patients in the clinic, it must first undergo testing. One of the most effective testing methods is preclinical small animal testing, because the testing environment provides a large sample population on which treatment variations can be tested for efficacy and possible side effects. To improve the effectiveness of preclinical testing, the devices and methods used on small animals should closely resemble those used in the clinic. These include irradiators, fractionation schedules, repeatability methods, and results characterization. Results characterization will provide a translational pathway between the preclinical and clinical environments of a small animal irradiation and human treatments to account for variation in treatment beams and subject size between preclinical and clinical irradiations. The Biomedical Physics Laboratory at Washington University in St. Louis, with whom I was working, developed a preclinical small animal image guided microirradiator, the microIGRT, and we characterized the device using clinical methods, such as those used for machine acceptance and quality assurance. In order to provide treatment verification and subject positioning repeatability, we designed, developed, and characterized a micro electronic portal imaging device (μEPID), similar to the portal devices used on clinical linear accelerators. Using the microIGRT and the μEPID, we developed treatments for small animal brain, lung, liver, and spinal tumors using clinical treatment planning methodologies translated to preclinical small animal models. We characterized the treatment results with several metrics and compared these to clinical treatments. The metrics were compared, side by side, and conclusions were drawn for the efficacy of the small animal treatment to establish the first steps for a pathway to translate preclinical results to clinical trials. Considering the difficulties of dosimetry for small fields commonly used in small animal irradiations, we also designed and developed a fiber scintillating microdosimeter. This dosimeter allowed for more accurate orthovoltage beam characterization, thus improving treatment planning and translational treatments...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Intraoperative <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>device</b> (IORT) {{is one of}} {{the several}} options for partial breast irradiation. IORT is sent to the tumor bed during surgery and can be {{replaced}} with conventional standard therapy (EBRT). The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the safety and effectiveness of IORT machine compared with EBRT and to determine the dominant option in terms of the cost-effectiveness. Method: This study was conducted in two phases; the first phase was a comprehensive review of the electronic databases search that was extracted after extraction and selection of the articles used in this article on effectiveness outcomes. Data collection form was completed by professionals and experts to estimate the cost of treatment, intraoperative radiotherapy and radiotherapy cost when using external radiation therapy process; direct costs were considered from the perspective of service provider and they were calculated in the second phase to determine the option of cost-effective ICER. Excel software was used for data analysis and sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the strength of the results of cost-effectiveness. Results: 18 studies were selected but only 8 of them were shown to have acceptable quality. The consequences like “rate of cancer recurrence”, “seroma”, “necrosis”, “toxic”, “skin disorders and delayed wound healing” and “spread the pain” were among the consequences used in the selected articles. The total costs for each patient during a course of treatment for EBRT and IORT were estimated 1398 and 5337. 5, respectively. During the analysis, cost-effectiveness of the consequences of cancer recurrence, seroma, necrosis and skin disorders and delayed wound healing ICER was calculated. And IORT was found to be the dominant supplier in all cases. Also, in terms of implications of toxicity and prevalence of pain, IORT had a lower cost and better effectiveness and consequently the result was more cost effective than EBRT. Conclusion: According to the results of this study, the difference between the two devices in terms of effectiveness was much lesser than that in terms of the cost of the two devices. According to the results of IORT machine, it is the dominant supplier compared with EBRT. From the cost-effectiveness perspective, Iran Ministry of Health can consider IORT system as an option for entering Iranian health system. But the ethical and cultural considerations in the use of the device must be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: A patient {{positioning}} system for radiation therapy based on structured white light and using off-the-shelf hardware components for flexibility and cost-effectiveness {{has been developed}} in house. Increased accuracy, patient comfort, abandonment of any skin marks, accelerated workflow, objective reading/recording, better usability and robust sensor design, compared to other positioning approaches, were the main goals of this work. Another aim was {{the application of a}} 6 degrees of freedom tracking system working without dose deposition. METHODS: Two optical sensors are the main parts of the TOPOS® system (Topometrical Positioning, cyberTECHNOLOGIES, Germany). The components: cameras, projectors, and computers are commercial off-the-shelf products, allowing for low production costs. The black/white cameras of the prototype are capable of taking up to 240 frames per second (resolution: 640 × 488 pixels). The projector has a resolution of 1024 × 768 and a refresh rate of 120 Hz. The patient's body surface is measured continuously and registered to a reference surface, providing a transformation to superimpose the patient's surface to the reference (planning CT) surface as best as possible. The execution of the calculated transformation provides the correct patient position before the treatment starts. Due to the high-speed acquisition of the surfaces, a surveillance of the patient's (respiration) motion during treatment is also accomplished. The accuracy of the system was determined using a male mannequin. Two treatment sites were evaluated: one simulating a head and neck treatment and the other simulating a thoracic wall treatment. The mannequin was moved to predefined positions, and shift vectors given by the surface registration were evaluated. Additionally manual positioning using a color-coding system was evaluated. RESULTS: Two prototypes have been developed, each allowing a continuous high density scan of a 500 × 500 × 400 mm(3) (L × W × D) large volume with a refresh rate of 10 Hz (extendible to 20 Hz for a single sensor system). Surface and position correction display, as well as respiratory motion, is shown in real-time (delay < 200 ms) using present graphical hardware acceleration. For an intuitive view of the patient's misalignment, a fast surface registration algorithm has been developed and tested and a real-time color-coding technique is proposed and verified that allows the user to easily verify the position of the patient. Using first the surface registration and then the color coding the best results were obtained: for the head and neck case, the mean difference between the actual zero position and the final match was 0. 1 ± 0. 4, - 0. 2 ± 0. 7, and - 0. 1 ± 0. 3 mm in vertical, longitudinal, and lateral direction. For the thoracic case, the mean differences were 0. 3 ± 0. 5, - 0. 6 ± 1. 9, 0. 0 ± 0. 4 mm. CONCLUSIONS: The presented system copes with the increasing demand for more accurate patient positioning due to more precise irradiation technologies and minimizes the preparation times for correct patient alignment, therefore optimizing the treatment workflow. Moreover, TOPOS is a versatile and cost effective image guided <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> <b>device.</b> It allows an objective rating of the patient's position before and during the irradiation and could also be used for respiratory gating or tracking...|$|E

Indirect conversion dosimetric materials are explored for possible future applications in Microbeam <b>Radiation</b> <b>Therapy</b> <b>devices.</b> The indirect conversion materials barium borophosphates, barium fluorophosphates with sodium ion modifier, and barium aluminosilicates were synthesized and studied. Each synthesized compound was also doped (or additionally co-doped) with a rare-earth compound. The rare-earth compounds used for doping included samarium (III) oxide, and samarium (III) fluoride. Codoping was explored with the compound erbium (III) chloride. Synthesized samples were x-ray irradiated at the Biomedical Imaging and Therapy beamline of the Canadian Light Source and also at the University of Saskatchewan. Experimental characterization methods of dosimetric material samples included x-ray luminescence, photoluminescence, electron spin resonance, Raman spectroscopy, absorbance spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, and modulated differential scanning calorimetry. The materials are experimentally characterized and determined for their merit in further research and development. All materials were found to scintillate, and some were found to function as x-ray storage phosphors as well. The barium borophosphates and also the barium fluorophosphates with sodium ion modifier possessed x-ray storage functionality according to photoluminescence spectra. An absorbance peak was observed after x-ray irradiation for barium fluorophosphates. Electron spin resonance data suggest that x-ray irradiation forms two similar types of paramagnetic defects for barium borophosphates. It appears that these defects are oxygen hole centres, which form during the indirect conversion process of samarium dopant cations. Indirect conversion involves samarium cation valency change from the 3 + to 2 + oxidation state, occurring when an electron is captured by the cation. Thermal analysis of the barium fluorophosphates by differential scanning calorimetry and modulated scanning calorimetry indicate preferential properties and moderate glass forming ability for manufacturing processes. It is concluded that barium fluorophosphates are best suited for dosimetric detectors, and secondly, barium borophosphates. Finally, future studies on materials for dosimetry in Microbeam <b>Radiation</b> <b>Therapy</b> are recommended...|$|R

40|$|As {{mechanical}} stability of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> treatment <b>devices</b> has gone beyond sub-millimeter levels, {{there is a}} rising demand for simple yet highly accurate measurement techniques to support the routine quality control of these devices. A combination of using high-resolution radiosensitive film and computer-aided analysis could provide an answer. One generally known technique is the acquisition of star shot films to determine the {{mechanical stability}} of rotations of gantries and the therapeutic beam. With computer-aided analysis, mechanical performance can be quantified as a radiation isocenter radius size. In this work, computer-aided analysis of star shot film is further refined by applying an analytical solution for the smallest intersecting circle problem, {{in contrast to the}} gradient optimization approaches used until today. An algorithm is presented and subjected to a performance test using two different types of radiosensitive film, the Kodak EDR 2 radiographic film and the ISP EBT 2 radiochromic film. Artificial star shots with a priori known radiation isocenter size are used to determine the systematic errors introduced by the digitization of the film and the computer analysis. The estimated uncertainty on the isocenter size measurement with the presented technique was 0. 04 mm (2 σ) and 0. 06 mm (2 σ) for radiographic and radiochromic films, respectively. As an application of the technique, a study was conducted to compare the mechanical stability of O-ring gantry systems with C-arm-based gantries. In total ten systems of five different institutions were included in this study and star shots were acquired for gantry, collimator, ring, couch rotations and gantry wobble. It was not possible to draw general conclusions about differences in mechanical performance between O-ring and C-arm gantry systems, mainly due to differences in the beam-MLC alignment procedure accuracy. Nevertheless, the best performing O-ring system in this study, a BrainLab/MHI Vero system, and the best performing C-arm system, a Varian Truebeam system, showed comparable mechanical performance: gantry isocenter radius of 0. 12 and 0. 09 mm, respectively, ring/couch rotation of below 0. 10 mm for both systems and a wobble of 0. 06 and 0. 18 mm, respectively.

40|$|AIMS AND BACKGROUND: To examine {{acute and}} {{subacute}} urinary and rectal toxicity {{in patients with}} localized prostate cancer monotherapeutically treated with the following four radiotherapeutic techniques: intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> low-dose-rate permanent implant brachytherapy using I- 125 seeds, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-six patients with localized prostate cancer were distributed as follows: 57 underwent intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> 35 underwent three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> 37 underwent I- 125 implant, and 27 underwent high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The prescribed doses were 70 - 74 Gy/ 35 - 37 fractions, 70 Gy/ 35 fractions, 145 Gy, and 45. 5 Gy/ 7 fraction/ 4 days for intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> I- 125 implant, and high-dose-rate brachytherapy, respectively. Toxicities (≤ 6 months) were retrospectively evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. 03. RESULTS: The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (33 / 35, 94 %) {{was significantly higher than}} that with high-dose-rate brachytherapy (18 / 27, 67 %) or intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (37 / 57, 65 %) (P < 0. 05). The frequency of grade 1 or 2 urinary toxicities using I- 125 implant was 31 / 37, 84 %. The frequency of grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities using three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> (17 / 35, 49 %) was significantly higher than that using I- 125 implant (4 / 37, 11 %) or high-dose-rate brachytherapy (0 / 27, 0 %) (P < 0. 05). Using intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> the frequency of grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities was 18 / 57 (32 %), which was significantly higher than that using high-dose-rate brachytherapy (0 / 27, 0 %) (P < 0. 05). Grade 3 or greater adverse events were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: Acute and subacute genitourinary toxicities were observed more frequently after three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> than after high-dose-rate brachytherapy or intensity-modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Acute and subacute gastrointestinal toxicities were seen more often after three-dimensional conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> than after brachytherapy (I- 125 implant or high-dose-rate brachytherapy) ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. In 1988, Delattre et al. {{described}} {{the first case}} of erythema multiforme associated with phenytoin and cranial <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> In 2004, Ahmed et al. coined the term EMPACT syndrome (Erythema Multiforme associated with Phenytoin And Cranial <b>Radiation</b> <b>Therapy).</b> Case report. A 61 -year-old patient with glioblastoma was admitted to our hospital with mucosal and cutaneous involvement diagnosed as Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by combined treatment consisting of carbamazepine and <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> The cutaneous and mucosal lesions were successfully treated with prednisone and discontinuation of carbamazepine, chemotherapy and <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Conclusions. A discussion is ongoing in the literature about a possible association between <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> anticonvulsant treatment and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. We present a rare case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome induced by carbamazepine combined with <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> and suggest a new acronym – EMDART (Erythema Multiforme associated with Drug And <b>Radiation</b> <b>Therapy)</b> for the description of this entity, as a wider term compared to EMPACT. The newly suggested term includes all diseases in the spectrum of erythema multiforme (also Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) induced by all drugs (not only phenytoin) in association with <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> in all locations...|$|R
40|$|<b>Radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> {{is one of}} the {{modalities}} {{for treating}} cancers. It has been image-based since its early stage of implementation. Medical images are used in <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> for tumor diagnosis, tumor delineation, treatment planning and treatment verification. Computerization and advanced development in medical imaging have revolutionarized the practice of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> The invention of computer-controlled multileaf collimators leads to the development of conformal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> and intensity modulated <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> which enables the irradiated target volume to be more conformed to the shape of the tumor, sparing more surrounding normal tissue and thus decrease the probability of toxic effects to normal tissue. At the same time, a higher dose can be delivered to the tumor for better tumor control. However, systematic and random errors due to patient positioning and organ motion occur in a course of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> They need to be monitored and accounted for by more stringent image guidance methods at times of tumor delineation, treatment planning and treatment delivery. This chapter describes the concept of image guidance in <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> and reviews the different technologies adopted for image-guided <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> Department of Health Technology and Informatic...|$|R
30|$|Although several reports {{recommend}} {{surgery and}} adjuvant <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> with large doses, no formal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> trials {{have been done}} [19]. Moreover, repeated exposure of the area to radiation is {{likely to result in}} local recurrences [12]. Therefore, we consider that the use of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> for RAAS is also controversial. Additionally, the relationship between RAAS and radiation dose remains unclear. In our case, the patient had been subjected to <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> twice, and RAAS had clearly arisen in the irradiated area of her chest wall. This indicates that the use of <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> to treat RAAS may increase the risk of local recurrence or another new occurrence of RAAS.|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{a leading}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the modern world. Treatment modalities comprise <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy,</b> surgery, chemotherapy and hormonal <b>therapy.</b> <b>Radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> can be performed by using external or internal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy.</b> However, each method has its unique properties which undertakes special role in cancer treatment, this question is brought up that: For cancer treatment, whether external <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> is more efficient or internal <b>radiation</b> <b>therapy</b> one? To answer this question, we need to consider principles and structure of individual methods. In this review, principles and application of each method are considered and finally these two methods are compared with each other...|$|R
