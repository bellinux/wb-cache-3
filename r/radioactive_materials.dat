5|$|A planet or moon's {{interior}} heat {{is produced}} from the collisions {{that created the}} body, by the decay of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> (e.g. uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies. Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics. Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water. Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases {{with the exception of}} impact cratering.|$|E

5000|$|Entombment/ENTOMB: This option entails {{placing the}} {{facility}} into {{a condition that}} will allow the remaining <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> to remain on-site indefinitely. This option usually involves reducing the size of the area where the <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> is located and then encasing the facility in a long-lived material such as concrete, theoretically preventing a release of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material.</b>|$|R
5|$|During the Cold War, {{the project}} {{expanded}} to include nine nuclear reactors and five large plutonium processing complexes, which produced plutonium {{for most of the}} more than 60,000 weapons built for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Nuclear technology developed rapidly during this period, and Hanford scientists produced major technological achievements. Many early safety procedures and waste disposal practices were inadequate, and government documents have confirmed that Hanford's operations released significant amounts of <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> into the air and the Columbia River.|$|E
5|$|Polonium and its {{compounds}} must {{be handled}} in a glove box, which is further enclosed in another box, maintained at a slightly higher pressure than the glove box to prevent the <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> from leaking out. Gloves made of natural rubber do not provide sufficient protection against the radiation from polonium; surgical gloves are necessary. Neoprene gloves shield radiation from polonium better than natural rubber.|$|E
5|$|According to the 2008 book The Bomb in the Basement, several {{deaths in}} Israel during 1957–1969 {{were caused by}} 210Po. A leak was {{discovered}} at a Weizmann Institute laboratory in 1957. Traces of 210Po {{were found on the}} hands of Professor Dror Sadeh, a physicist who researched <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials.</b> Medical tests indicated no harm, but the tests did not include bone marrow. Sadeh died from cancer. One of his students died of leukemia, and two colleagues died after a few years, both from cancer. The issue was investigated secretly, and there was never any formal admission that a connection between the leak and the deaths had existed.|$|E
40|$|Staff of the King County Wastewater Treatment Division (WTD) have {{concern about}} the {{aftermath}} of a radiological dispersion event (RDE) leading to the introduction of significant quantities of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> into the combined sanitary and storm sewer system in King County, Washington. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>material</b> could come from the use of a radiological dispersion device (RDD). RDDs include "dirty bombs" that are not nuclear detonations but are explosives designed to spread <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> (National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) 2001). <b>Radioactive</b> <b>material</b> also could come from deliberate introduction or dispersion of <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> into the environment, including waterways and water supply systems. This document, Volume 3 of PNNL- 15163 is the technical basis for the Annex to the West Point Treatment Plant (WPTP) Emergency Response Plan related to responding to a radiological emergency at the WPTP. The plan primarily considers response to <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> that has been introduced in the other combined sanitary and storm sewer system from a radiological dispersion device, but is applicable to any accidental or deliberate introduction of materials into the system...|$|R
50|$|Contamination {{does not}} include {{residual}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> remaining at a site {{after the completion of}} decommissioning. Therefore, <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> in sealed and designated containers is not properly referred to as contamination, although the units of measurement might be the same.|$|R

5|$|As well as {{the work}} on reactor development, the Metallurgical Laboratory studied the {{chemistry}} and metallurgy of plutonium, and worked with DuPont to develop the bismuth phosphate process used to separate plutonium from uranium. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about {{the health and safety}} aspects, and the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous. The Metallurgical Laboratory became the first of the national laboratories, the Argonne National Laboratory, on 1 July 1946.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to safety design, new security measures will be implemented. All vehicles will be screened for <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> and other potentially dangerous objects before {{they enter the}} site through the underground road. Four hundred closed-circuit surveillance cameras will be placed {{in and around the}} site, with live camera feeds being continuously monitored by the NYPD. A computer system will use video-analytic computer software, designed to detect potential threats, such as unattended bags, and retrieve images based on descriptions of terrorists or other criminal suspects. New York City and Port Authority police will patrol the site.|$|E
5|$|Natural thorium decays {{very slowly}} {{compared}} {{to many other}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials,</b> and the emitted alpha radiation cannot penetrate human skin. As a result, handling small amounts of thorium, {{such as those in}} gas mantles, is considered safe, although the use of such items may pose some risks. Exposure to an aerosol of thorium, such as contaminated dust, can lead to increased risk of cancers of the lung, pancreas, and blood, as lungs and other internal organs can be penetrated by alpha radiation. Exposure to thorium internally leads to increased risk of liver diseases.|$|E

5|$|Office {{space was}} {{initially}} {{found in the}} Monsanto offices at 1515 Nicholas Rd, which became known as Unit I. Unit II was the Monsanto Rocket Propellant works off Betty Lane near Ohio State Route 741. While it was administered by Monsanto, it was not used by the Dayton Project. The site handled explosives including ammonium nitrate and ammonium picrate, but no <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> were handled there. Work at Unit II ceased {{in the fall of}} 1945. Consideration was given to using it in December 1946, but this proposal was rejected in favor of erecting a Quonset hut at Unit III.|$|E
5|$|Weisman {{explains}} that a common house {{would begin to}} fall apart as water eventually leaks into the roof around the flashings, erodes the wood and rusts the nails, leading to sagging walls and eventual collapse. After 500 years, all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles. The longest-lasting evidence on Earth of a human presence would be <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials,</b> ceramics, bronze statues, and Mount Rushmore. In space, the Pioneer plaques, the Voyager Golden Record, and radio waves would outlast the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|While {{studying}} naturally fluorescing minerals in 1896, the French physicist Henri Becquerel {{discovered that}} they emitted radiation without any exposure to an external energy source. These <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> {{became the subject of}} much interest by scientists, including the New Zealand physicist Ernest Rutherford who discovered they emitted particles. He designated these particles alpha and beta, {{on the basis of their}} ability to penetrate matter. In 1900, Becquerel showed that the beta rays emitted by radium could be deflected by an electric field, and that their mass-to-charge ratio was the same as for cathode rays. This evidence strengthened the view that electrons existed as components of atoms.|$|E

5|$|Depleted uranium is {{also used}} as a {{shielding}} material in some containers used to store and transport <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials.</b> While the metal itself is radioactive, its high density makes it more effective than lead in halting radiation from strong sources such as radium. Other uses of depleted uranium include counterweights for aircraft control surfaces, as ballast for missile re-entry vehicles and as a shielding material. Due to its high density, this material is found in inertial guidance systems and in gyroscopic compasses. Depleted uranium is preferred over similarly dense metals due to its ability to be easily machined and cast {{as well as its}} relatively low cost. The main risk of exposure to depleted uranium is chemical poisoning by uranium oxide rather than radioactivity (uranium being only a weak alpha emitter).|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1990s, an {{independent}} Health Advisory Panel - appointed by then-Governor Roy Romer - oversaw {{a series of}} reports, called the Historical Public Exposure Studies. The 12-member Health Advisory Panel included multiple medical doctors, scientists, PhDs, and local officials. The Rocky Flats Historical Public Exposure Studies involved nine years of research. The Studies had three main objectives: (1) create a public record of plant operations and accidents that contributed to contaminant releases from the Rocky Flats Plant between 1952 and 1989; (2) assess public exposures to contaminants and potential risks from past releases; and, (3) determine the need for future studies. The Studies' research included identification and assessment of chemicals and <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> from past releases; estimates of risk to residents living or working in surrounding communities during the Plant's operation from 1952 to 1989; an evaluation of possible exposure pathways; and, dose assessments for historical releases.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, {{and is not}} {{a threat}} after a fairly short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, have a long enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees in the area to not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials.</b> The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{intercontinental}} <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> shipping {{campaigns have}} focused public and regulatory {{attention on the}} safety of transport of this material by ocean-going vessels. One major concern is {{the response of the}} vessel and onboard <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> (RAM) packages during a severe ship-to-ship collision. These collisions occur at velocities less than the velocity obtained in the Type B package regulatory impact event and the bow of the striking ship is less rigid than the unyielding target used in those tests (Ammerman and Daidola, 1996). This implies that ship impact is not a credible scenario for damaging the <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> packages during ship collisions. It is possible, however, for these collisions to generate significant amounts of crush force by the bow of the impacting ship overrunning the package. It is the aim of this paper to determine an upper bound on the magnitude of this crush force taking into account the strength of the <b>radioactive</b> <b>material</b> carrying vessel and any other cargo that may be stowed in the same hold as the <b>radioactive</b> <b>material...</b>|$|R

5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a power reactor used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E
5|$|The {{dangers of}} {{radiation}} poisoning had become well-known {{due to the}} experience of the radium dial painters. When it became certain that nuclear reactors would involve <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials</b> on a gigantic scale, there was considerable concern about the health and safety aspects. Robert S. Stone, who had worked with Ernest Lawrence at the University of California, was recruited to head the Metallurgical Project's health and safety program. Simeon Cutler, a radiologist, assumed responsibility for radiation safety in Chicago, before moving on to head the program at the Hanford Site. Groves appointed Stafford L. Warren from the University of Rochester as head of the Manhattan Project's Medical Section. Over time, the study of the biological effects of radiation assumed greater importance. It was discovered that plutonium, like radium, was a bone seeker, making it especially hazardous.|$|E
5|$|Under Boyd's purview, the Engineering Experiment Station {{was awarded}} many electronics-related contracts, {{to the extent}} that an Electronics Division was created in 1959; it focused on radar and communications. In 1955, Georgia Tech {{president}} Blake R. Van Leer appointed Boyd to Georgia Tech's Nuclear Science Committee. The committee recommended the creation of a Radioisotopes Laboratory Facility and the construction of a large research reactor. The former was built and dedicated on January 7, 1959, and could receive, store, and process <b>radioactive</b> <b>materials.</b> The Frank H. Neely Research Reactor was completed in 1963 and was operational until 1996, when the fuel was removed because of safety concerns related to the nearby 1996 Summer Olympics events. In 1961, Boyd was succeeded in the directorship by Robert E. Stiemke, who had previously been the director of Georgia Tech's School of Civil Engineering.|$|E
