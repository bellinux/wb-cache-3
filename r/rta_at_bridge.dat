Using audio frequency folded-flexure comb-drive resonators, the mechanical quality factor of poly-SiGe was determined at 2 µTorr pressure. As-deposited poly-SiGe has Q = 20, 000 – 31, 000. CMOS compatible {{rapid thermal annealing}} (<b>RTA)</b> <b>at</b> 525 °C for 60 seconds results in a quality factor between 40, 000 and 44, 000. We have measured the highest Q factor yet reported for poly-SiGe (Q � 61, 100), {{as a result of}} <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 600 °C for one minute. The measured resonant frequencies of the resonators were used to back-calculate the Young’s modulus of poly-SiGe: E = 155 ± 5 GPa. The calculated elastic modulus is significantly higher than the metallurgical Young’s modulus of 146 GPa. The as-deposited strain gradient of the tri-layer poly-SiGe film was found to be 1. 75 · 10 - 4 µm- 1 (curl-up). <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 600 °C for one minute drops the tri-layer strain gradient to 2. 67 · 10 - 5 µm- 1 (curl-up).

40|$|Results of a post-growth rapid thermal {{annealing}} (RTA) on GaAs proximity-capped structures with high density (- 10 (11) cm(- 2)) of self-assembled InAs/GaAs quantum dots (QDs) are presented. Features due to the QDs, bi-dimensional platelets (2 DP) and InAs wetting layer (WL) were identified in photoluminescence (PL) spectrum of the as-grown sample. It is shown, using transmission electron microscopy, that <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> temperature up to 700 degreesC (for 30 s) results in an increase of QDs lateral sizes. After <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 800 degreesC or higher temperatures, no QDs can be distinguished and substantial thickening of the WL can be seen. The main PL peak blueshifts {{as a result of}} RTA in all investigated temperature ranges, which is accompanied by a quenching of the 2 DP and WL PL. It is proposed that the main PL peak, which is due to the QDs in the as-grown sample, results from optical recombination in the modified WL in the samples, after <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 800 degreesC and higher temperatures. Laterally- enhanced Ga/In interdiffusion induced by strain is proposed to explain a relatively fast dissolution of QDs. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|A rapid thermal anneal (<b>RTA)</b> <b>at</b> low {{pressure}} is proposed as an efficient method {{for the elimination}} of the surface inversion layer formed by the charges within the field oxide orby the leakage current along the field oxide surface which is easily contaminated byphotoresist, water molecules, and mobile ions.

It was also found that after a {{low pressure}} RTA the gate oxide endurance can be dramatically enhanced and is comparable to that of the conventional furnace-annealed gate oxide. Rap id thermal anneal (RTA) has been used for semicon-ductor device fabrication due to its fast heating nature wh ich can avoid the possible dopant redistribution during the high temperature processing cycle.

Therefore, the photocurrent growth as well as decay becomes faster after the RTA treatment. The calculations of individual time constants show that electron-hole recombination as well as generation rates become double after <b>RTA</b> <b>at</b> 700 °C and do not change significantly for further annealing. On the other hand, oxygen adsorption rates during the photocurrent growth as well as decay are systematically decreases. Similar bi-exponential decay behavior with time constants of several seconds has been reported by several groups for the ZnO nanobelts, NWs, and thin film [1, 5, 11, 14, 30]. Figure 5 b shows the photoresponse of the RTA-treated NWs under periodic UV illumination. The maximum photocurrent in the next cycle is slightly increased compared to the previous cycle because of the incomplete growth and decay of the PC during the measurement cycle.
