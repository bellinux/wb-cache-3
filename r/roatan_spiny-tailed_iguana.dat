50|$|The black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} to South Florida and reproduces in the wild in several feral populations. On the southeastern Florida coast, black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguanas</b> have been found on Key Biscayne, Hialeah, and in Broward County. On the southwestern Florida coast, it has been discovered on Gasparilla Island and in adjacent areas, throughout Lee and Charlotte counties. This iguana has also been introduced to several islands in the Caribbean. As this species will opportunistically feed on small vertebrates, such as fish, rodents, eggs, birds, and even hatchling sea turtles it may {{pose a threat to}} endangered native species.|$|R
5000|$|The {{world record}} sprint speed for lizards (21.5 miles/h or 34.6 km/h) was {{attained}} by the Costa Rican <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana,</b> hence the nickname [...] "Iguana" [...] from the jungle guard Andrés Pmorado (Ctenosaura similis).|$|R

50|$|San Esteban Island {{is home to}} {{many types}} of odd animal species found on {{only a few of}} the islands, such as the San Esteban {{chuckwalla}} (Sauromalus varius), the spiny chuckwalla (S. hispidus) and the <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> (Ctenosaura conspicuosa).|$|R
40|$|Prey {{animals can}} reduce {{their risk of}} {{predation}} by detecting potential predators before encounters occur. Some animals gain information about nearby predators by eavesdropping on heterospecific alarm calls. Despite having well-developed ears, most lizards do not use vocal information for intraspecific communication, and few studies have shown practical use of the ears in wild lizards. Here, we show that the Madagascan <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> (Oplurus cuvieri cuvieri) obtains auditory signals for predator detection. The Madagascan <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> and the Madagascar paradise flycatcher (Terpsiphone mutata) are syntopic inhabitants of the Ampijoroa dry deciduous forest of Madagascar. The iguana and the flycatcher have neither a predator–prey relationship nor resource competition, but they have shared predators such as raptors and snakes. Using playback experiments, we demonstrated that the iguana discriminates mobbing alarm calls of the flycatcher from its songs and then enhances its vigilance behaviour. Our results demonstrate the occurrence of an asymmetrical ecological relationship between the Madagascan <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> and the paradise flycatcher through eavesdropping on information {{about the presence of}} predators. This implies that indirect interspecific interactions through information recognition may be more common than generally thought in an animal community...|$|R
50|$|The {{habitat of}} C. palearis is {{characterized}} by a greater frequency of Stenocereus pruinosus, Albizzia idiopoda, Ximena americana and Acacia deamii. The Guatemalan <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> can be regarded as a keystone species because it {{plays an important role in}} seed dispersal of S. pruinosus.|$|R
50|$|Like {{many other}} lizards, {{including}} the frilled lizard and basilisk, collared lizards can run on their hind legs, and are relatively fast sprinters. Record speeds {{have been around}} 16 mph, much slower than the world record for lizards (21.5 mph) attained by the larger-bodied Costa Rican <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana,</b> Ctenosaura similis.|$|R
50|$|Ctenosaura similis, {{commonly}} known as the black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana,</b> black iguana, or black ctenosaur, is a lizard native to Mexico and Central America that has been introduced to the United States in the state of Florida. It is the largest species in the genus Ctenosaura and has been recorded as the fastest-running species of lizard.|$|R
50|$|There are 132 {{species of}} birds, 10 {{species of fish}} and 8 species of mammals. Some also are {{protected}} species such as White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), Mexican <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> (Ctenosaura pectinata), chupaflor barbón (Calothyorax pulcher), blue seedeater (Amaurospiza relicta), papamoscas pardooscuro (Xenotriccus mexicanus), Molly (Poecilia maylani), repotete (Heterandria bimaculata), sardine (Astyanax aeneus) and crappie (Ilyodon whitei).|$|R
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of Central America, the black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana,</b> colloquially called the [...] "chicken of the trees," [...] is farmed {{alongside}} the green iguana as a food source and for export for the pet trade iguana meat. Although it is heavily hunted {{it does not appear}} to be endangered in any of its native territory.|$|R
50|$|The Iguana Specialist Group (ISG) is {{concerned}} with the conservation of 45 lizards in the family Iguanidae in North, Central and South America, the Caribbean, and the Galapagos and Fijian Islands. Included are the marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus), Melanesian iguanas (Brachylophus), Galápagos land <b>iguanas</b> (Conolophus), <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguanas</b> (Ctenosaura), rock iguanas (Cyclura), desert iguanas (Dipsosaurus), green iguanas (Iguana), and chuckwallas (Sauromalus).|$|R
40|$|Reducing {{populations of}} {{invasive}} lizards through trapping and shooting is feasible {{in many cases}} but effective integrated management relies {{on a variety of}} tools, including toxicants. In Florida, using wild-caught non-native black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguanas</b> Ctenosaura similis, we screened acetaminophen and zinc phosphide to determine their suitability for effective population management of this prolific invasive species. Of the animals that received acetaminophen, none died except at the highest test dose, 240 mg per lizard, which is not practical for field use. Zinc phosphide produced 100 % mortality at dose levels as little as 25 mg per lizard, equivalent to about 0. 5 % in bait which is lower than currently used in commercial baits for commensal rodent control. We conclude that zinc phosphide has potential as a useful tool for reducing populations of invasive lizards such as the black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> provided target-selective delivery methods are develope...|$|R
50|$|The black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{native to}} Central America, and has the widest range of all Ctenosaura species from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to northeastern Nicaragua and western Panama on the {{respective}} Atlantic and Pacific coasts. It is commonly found throughout Costa Rica, Honduras and {{has been reported in}} Colombia. In addition to its varied appearance it may interbreed with other Ctenosaur species throughout this range.|$|R
50|$|Black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{excellent}} climbers, and prefer a rocky habitat {{with plenty of}} crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered. The Guinness Book of World Records lists this as the world's fastest lizard, with a maximal sprint speed of 34.6 km/h.|$|R
50|$|Many {{endangered}} species are kept at Tilgate Nature Centre, which {{has taken on}} {{an important role in}} conservation, protecting {{endangered species}} from extinction due to rapid changes affecting their natural habitats. Tilgate Nature Centre has become nationally important for maintaining breeding groups of these animals to preserve a variety of endangered wild species. Critically endangered animals include Northern bald ibis, Utila <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana,</b> Laysan duck and swift parakeet.|$|R
5000|$|The Motagua Valley thornscrub forms {{a habitat}} for 75 bird species, mainly Columbidae, Tyrannidae, Icteridae and Fringillidae, {{and it is}} the only place in Central America where Momotus mexicanus lives. [...] It is also home to a number of {{threatened}} lizards, including the Guatemalan <b>Spiny-tailed</b> <b>Iguana</b> (Ctenosaura palearis), and the Motagua Valley beaded lizard (Heloderma horridum charlesbogerti), one of the world's most endangered lizards which is endemic to this ecoregion.|$|R
5000|$|The black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1831. The generic name, Ctenosaura, {{is derived from}} two Greek words: ctenos (Κτενός), meaning [...] "comb" [...] (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning [...] "lizard". Its specific name is the Latin word similis meaning [...] "similar to", a common description found in Linnean taxonomy when referring to a new taxon.|$|R
50|$|Cape Coral is home {{to three}} {{invasive}} species. The green <b>iguana</b> and the <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> and in 2009, the Nile monitor was discovered. The iguanas are found throughout southern Florida and generally do not pose a threat. The Nile monitor is however a large (7-9 feet), fast traveling, fast swimming, carnivore with a wide diet, which can include fish, fowl, and small mammals. The city's many waterways work against its capture and provide an easy transportation route around the city.|$|R
50|$|The woody {{stems of}} the {{mangroves}} provide habitats and food for marine fauna such as shellfish and fish.The mangroves serve as nurseries for fish, shrimps, crabs and invertebrates.Mammals {{that live in}} the trees include crab-eating raccoon (Procyon cancrivorus), mantled howler (Alouatta palliata), northern tamandua (Tamandua mexicana), raccoon (Procyon lotor), silky anteater (Cyclopes didactylus) and white-headed capuchin (Cebus capucinus).white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are found in Avicennia bicolor and Laguncularia racemosa mangrove forests.Reptiles include black <b>spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> (Ctenosaura similis), boa constrictor (Boa constrictor) and green iguana (Iguana iguana).|$|R
2500|$|The Mexican <b>Spiny-tailed</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{a social}} lizard, which has adapted to living in groups as opposed to other species of Ctenosaura {{which tend to be}} solitary animals. These iguanas are {{excellent}} climbers, and prefer a rocky habitat with plenty of crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered. [...] They are often found dwelling near or in towns in their native Mexico and where they have been introduced elsewhere.|$|R
5000|$|H. charlesbogerti dwells in arroyos {{characterized}} by high densities of bird nests of doves and parakeets, whose eggs form the primary component of its diet. [...] These birds nest {{closer to the}} ground in these arroyos in trees with branches thick enough to support the weight of this heavy-bodied lizard. [...] It is known to prey upon insects, such as beetles and crickets. The eggs of the Guatemalan <b>Spiny-tailed</b> <b>Iguana</b> (Ctenosaura palearis), an endangered species endemic to the same region, are an important food source for the Guatemalan beaded lizard, thereby possibly linking the status of the two.|$|R
