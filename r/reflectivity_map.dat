30|$|Since {{its origins}} in 1951, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) {{has been used for}} a wide variety of applications, from {{military}} reconnaissance to agricultural imaging to only name two examples [1]. Similarly to other radar imaging modalities, SAR techniques collect the reflections from an irradiated area and process them to create a <b>reflectivity</b> <b>map</b> from the scattering bodies present in the imaged region [2]. The SAR data acquisition process can be described as follows. A trajectory over the scan region is defined. Along this trajectory, an illuminating source radiates an ultra-wideband waveform and records the collected reflections from the objects inside the scan area. The recorded reflections are then processed to eliminate the distortions caused by the antenna, the shape of the irradiated waveform, and the motion of the moving platform [3 – 5]. Finally, the resulting <b>reflectivity</b> <b>map</b> can be visualized and interpreted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract P 33 B- 1465 Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionosphere Sounding (MARSIS) {{is a low}} {{frequency}} radar. The MARSIS wavelength is about 50 - 100 m. These radar waves penetrate deeply in the Martian ground and the first radar echo is due to few tens meters of the surface. The amplitude of this surface echo provides useful information on the shallow subsurface. Using MARSIS radar data, we extract the reflectivity of the Martian surface from the radargrams and then we build a global radar <b>reflectivity</b> <b>map.</b> We will describe our method for the extraction and the calibration of the reflectivity. In this calibration, we correct the absorption due to the two-way of radar waves through the Martian ionosphere and compensate the surface roughness effect. The surface roughness effect is estimated by simulating the radar surface returns for each MARSIS orbit.

30|$|The major {{contributions}} of this SAR raw data simulation procedure are as follows. Firstly, {{we proposed a}} reasonable criterion to assign the number of facets of the vertical features for double scattering phenomena and taken into consideration the orientation of each facet. Secondly, the simulator computes the <b>reflectivity</b> <b>map</b> very fast although it {{takes into account the}} double scattering case. There are other methods to model the backscattering concerning the materials, speckle effects, and triple scattering cases in detail. Here, however, our main purpose is to propose a geometrically accurate and computationally efficient <b>reflectivity</b> <b>map</b> generation and omitting these effects contributed significantly to increase the computational efficiency. From the raw data computation point of view, we proposed a new time domain method that consumes the duration of the procedure in an amount that is related with the resolution, pulse repetition frequency, and beamwidth of the antenna. We proposed a method for the verification of our raw SAR data simulation method. Besides, in many papers, the modularity advantage of time domain simulation was mentioned, however we represented some experiments showing the potentialities of time domain simulation.|$|E

Beside the error in the measurement of the rainfall reflectivity and its transformation into rainfall intensity, random errors can be generated by the temporal spacing of the radar scans. The aim of this work is to analize {{the sensitivity of the}} estimated rainfall maps to the radar sampling interval, i. e. the time interval between two consecutive radar scans. This analysis has been performed employing data collected with a polarimetric C-band radar in Rome, Italy. The radar data consist of <b>reflectivity</b> <b>maps</b> with a sampling interval of 1 min and a spatial resolution of 300 m, covering an area of 1296 km 2. The transformation of the <b>reflectivity</b> <b>maps</b> in rainfall fields has been validated against rainfall data collected by a network of 14 raingauges distributed across the study area. Accumulated rainfall maps have been calculated for different spatial resolutions (from 300 m to 2400 m) and different sampling intervals (from 1 min to 16 min). The observed differences between the estimated rainfall maps are significant, showing that the sampling interval can be an important source of error in radar rainfall measurements...|$|R

The use of such surfaces results in a varied reflectivity within the cavity and makes the boresight emissions spatially coherent. This provides high boresight directivity with improved bandwidth characteristics. With this surface as super-strate of a resonant cavity antenna, performance is evaluated for a single feed exciting the cavity.

The dataset was collected in summer 2006 by the RONSARD radar during the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) campaign and consists of <b>reflectivity</b> <b>maps</b> with a 400 m pixel size. The statistics of the reflectivity field are shown {{to depend on the}} resolution in a multiscaling way that is adequately represented by the three-parameter Universal Multifractal (UM) model. The estimated parameters show that the process is greatly intermittent and may produce enough extreme values (singularities) so that the highorder statistical moments of the process diverge, resulting in heavy-tailed probability distributions. The physical meaning of the parameters may be easily illustrated by numerical simulations of UM fields. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the extreme values of the <b>reflectivity</b> <b>maps</b> follow a power-law of the resolution λ, as predicted by the UM model. The scaling exponent γ= 0. 75 is close to that expected from the equations of the UM theory and may be retrieved from the analysis of the simulated UM fields. Such a powerlaw has strong implications on the corrections to do when comparing measurements at different resolutions (e. g. radar pixel/ rain gauge size). To illustrate, some potential applications of the latter equation to spatial downscaling of meteorological and hydrological processes are exposed...|$|R

Through a simulation process it is possible to analyze the image quality parameters for a given system configuration or evaluating the effects in SAR images when this configuration is changed. A new fast SAR image simulator (SARIS) is currently under development on the basis of an existing toolset called SAR end-to-end simulator (SETES). This image simulator produces SAR images by using the point spread function (PSF) of a focused point target response in contrast to SETES's very expensive raw data generation module.
