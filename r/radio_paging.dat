50|$|In 1979 Jersey's first <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> {{network was}} {{introduced}} using a Motorola campus type system, Jersey being small enough {{for such a}} system.

50|$|Development of WCTP was {{initiated}} by the Messaging Standards Committee and submitted to the <b>Radio</b> <b>Paging</b> Community. When the first proposal was received, a sub-committee was established to improve the protocol and issue it as a specification.

The PCIA (Personal Communications Industry) accepted the first full release and adopted the protocol as a PCIA standard. The current version is WCTP 1.3.|$|E
5000|$|The Arlington Fire District {{is one of}} 3 fire {{departments}} that provides fire and EMS services to {{the residents of the}} Town Of Poughkeepsie. Arlington has four fire stations located at numerous ends of the Town. The fire district is staffed with 78 career and 85 Volunteer members. The fire district is one of only two in Dutchess County that have career FF/Paramedics. Career firefighters and officers belong to the IAFF. Arlington's Dutchess County department ID number is [...] "32". Firefighters are dispatched via <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> by the Dutchess County Department Of Emergency Response who are based in Poughkeepsie.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method is}} to subject tone {{decoding}} to a time constraint. In the case of Quik Call I or a string of DTMF digits, the falsing would have {{to occur in the}} exact order required to actuate the decoder. This is much more improbable than falsing in a single tone decoder. In two-tone sequential, tone and voice <b>radio</b> <b>paging,</b> decoders are actuated by decoding one tone and then a second in the proper sequence. Falsing could only occur if the two decoders falsed in a valid sequence within the decoder's time constraints. Examples of systems of two-tone sequential paging are Motorola Quik Call II, General Electric Mobile Radio Type 99, and later-model Plectron receivers.|$|E

5000|$|The {{policy of}} {{liberalisation}} that was embarked by Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao in the 1990s helped the Indian Telecom sector to grow rapidly. The government gradually allowed {{the entry of}} the private sectors into telecom equipment manufacturing, value added services, <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> and cellular mobile services. In 1994, the government formed the National Telecom Policy (NTP) which helped to attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) and domestic investments. The entry of private and international players resulted in need of independent regulatory body. As a result, The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) was established on 20 February 1997 {{by an act of}} parliament called [...] "Telecom Regulatory Authority of India Act 1997".|$|E
50|$|Digital {{systems may}} {{communicate}} text messages from computer-aided dispatch (CAD). For example, a display in a tow truck may give a textual location for {{a call and}} any related details. The tow truck driver may press an acknowledge button, sending data {{in the opposite direction}} and flagging the call as received by the driver. They can be used for analog telemetry systems, such as the livestock tank levels, as described above. Another possibility is the lubricating oil pressure in a transit bus engine, or the current speed of the bus. Analog conditions are translated into data words. Some systems send <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> messages which can either 1) beep a paging receiver, 2) send a numeric message, or 3) send a text message.|$|E
50|$|Early <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> {{systems such}} as the Bell Telephone BELLBOY system used a shared carrier {{frequency}} and audio tone coding to identify the correct recipient of a message. These selectors used a tuning fork resonator rather than a simple single reed. This gives a more selective mechanical filter, allowing more frequencies to be spaced closely together. Even more importantly, the false-triggering harmonic for a tuning fork is more than six times its natural frequency, rather than merely twice its frequency, as for a reed. This means that the useful frequency range is over two octaves, rather than less than one octave. Multiple reeds {{could also be used}} together, either to identify separate frequencies to give multiple indications, or logically ANDed together to require more subscriber selections with a 2-code identifier rather than a single code.|$|E

5000|$|After the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) {{standards}} {{had been}} fixed {{in the late}} 1970s, [...] there were thoughts about making a public digital mobile communication network. Mobitex, a Public Access Mobile Radio network standard had been conceived in 1981, and put into operation in the mid-1980s. The cooperation programme between France and Germany was known as S900 (from the 900Mhz waveband, and was analogue) and {{was expected to be}} in operation by 1986. It was decided to create a digital mobile network, GSM, in 1984, and for this to be in operation {{by the end of the}} decade. A prototype digital system, DF900, would be in place before GSM was ready. The new GSM system would have a <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> service. The Europe-wide Eurosignal paging service had been in operation since 1974. Germany introduced its C-Netz analogue mobile phone network in 1985, based on the C450 standard; it had a digital switching system and digital control channels, and could have implemented a short data message system.|$|E
5000|$|In 1978, {{at the age}} of 20, Margolese founded Canadian Telecom, a Vancouver-based <b>radio</b> <b>paging</b> company. He {{struggled}} in his early years as an entrepreneur. In 1980, he changed his company’s focus to what would become the future cellular market. He prognosticated in his 1980 position paper, years before the commercial introduction of cellular {{and at a time when}} computers were in use by less than one percent of the public, that cellular [...] "has the potential to become all pervasive." [...] He also envisioned that it would [...] "be used for much more" [...] than just phone calls. When cell phones became widely available, it paid big dividends for Margolese. His company joined with Rogers Communications to form Cantel (a contraction of the name Canadian Telecom). Cantel would ultimately become Rogers Wireless, as of 2012 the largest cellular company in Canada, with over 9.3 million subscribers and revenues over $7 billion. Margolese cashed out of the company in 1989 to found his next venture.|$|E
