5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction.

Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu <b>radionuclide</b> for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{radioisotope}} 16N is {{the dominant}} <b>radionuclide</b> in the coolant of pressurised water reactors or boiling water reactors during normal operation, and thus it is a sensitive and immediate indicator of leaks from the primary coolant system to the secondary steam cycle, and is the primary means of detection for such leaks. It is produced from 16O (in water) via an (n,p) reaction in which the 16O atom captures a neutron and expels a proton. It has a short half-life of about 7.1 s, but during its decay back to 16O produces high-energy gamma radiation (5 to 7MeV). Because of this, access to the primary coolant piping in a pressurised water reactor must be restricted during reactor power operation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Radionuclides</b> are {{produced}} as an unavoidable result of nuclear fission and thermonuclear explosions. The process of nuclear fission creates {{a wide range}} of fission products, most of which are <b>radionuclides.</b> Further <b>radionuclides</b> can be created from irradiation of the nuclear fuel (creating a range of actinides) and of the surrounding structures, yielding activation products. This complex mixture of <b>radionuclides</b> with different chemistries and radioactivity makes handling nuclear waste and dealing with nuclear fallout particularly problematic.|$|R

40|$|It was {{recently}} discovered that waste being disposed of onsite contained <b>radionuclides</b> {{that had not}} been analyzed by the Performance Assessment (PA). These <b>radionuclides</b> had been eliminated from the PA in an earlier screening evaluation because they were not expected to be contained in SRS-generated waste or that received from offsite generators. This Special Analysis (SA) is being prepared to establish the screening criteria and level of evaluation for all <b>radionuclides</b> potentially significant to a Low Level Waste PA or Composite Analysis (CA). The screening methodology recommended by the National Council on Radiological Protection and Measurements (NCRP) has been used to identify those <b>radionuclides</b> that require detailed analysis to derive disposal limits. Of the approximately 2800 <b>radionuclides,</b> a total of 826 were considered by the NCRP to be potentially significant. Approximately 686 <b>radionuclides</b> were eliminated from this analysis due to their short half-life or other properties. Approximately 40 of the 140 remaining <b>radionuclides</b> have been analyzed in the existing PA and waste acceptance criteria established. This SA develops the screening criteria and establishes trigger values to be used to determine the level of analysis required for those <b>radionuclides</b> not analyzed in PA. The results of the SA identified 20 <b>radionuclides</b> that will require more detailed groundwater and intruder analysis. This analysis will be documented in a SA for trench disposal...|$|R

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{practically}} stable 48Ca, the longest lived radioisotope of calcium is 41Ca. It decays by electron capture to stable 41K with a half-life {{of about a}} hundred thousand years. Its existence in the early Solar System as an extinct <b>radionuclide</b> has been inferred from excesses of 41K: traces of 41Ca also still exist today, {{as it is a}} cosmogenic nuclide, continuously reformed through neutron activation of natural 40Ca. Many other calcium radioisotopes are known, ranging from 34Ca to 57Ca: they are all much shorter-lived than 41Ca, the most stable among them being 45Ca (half-life 163days) and 47Ca (half-life 4.54days). The isotopes lighter than 42Ca usually undergo beta plus decay to isotopes of potassium, and those heavier than 44Ca usually undergo beta minus decay to isotopes of scandium, although near the nuclear drip lines proton emission and neutron emission begin to be significant decay modes as well.|$|E
5|$|The longest-lived isotope of curium, 247Cm, has a {{half-life}} of 15.6 million years. Therefore, any primordial curium, that is curium {{present on}} the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now, although some of it would be detectable as an extinct <b>radionuclide</b> as an excess of its nearly stable daughter 235U. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent nuclear fuel. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric nuclear weapons tests, which were conducted between 1945 and 1980. So {{the analysis of the}} debris at the testing site of the first U.S. hydrogen bomb, Ivy Mike, (1 November 1952, Enewetak Atoll), beside einsteinium, fermium, plutonium and americium also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular 245Cm, 246Cm and smaller quantities of 247Cm, 248Cm and 249Cm.

5|$|The longest-lived of the {{radioactive}} isotopes of iodine is iodine-129, {{which has a}} half-life of 15.7millionyears, decaying via beta decay to stable xenon-129. Some iodine-129 was formed along with iodine-127 before {{the formation of the}} Solar System, but it has by now completely decayed away, making it an extinct <b>radionuclide</b> that is nevertheless still useful in dating the history of the early Solar System or very old groundwaters, due to its mobility in the environment. Its former presence may be determined from an excess of its daughter xenon-129. Traces of iodine-129 still exist today, as it is also a cosmogenic nuclide, formed from cosmic ray spallation of atmospheric xenon: these traces make up 10−14 to 10−10 of all natural iodine. It also occurs from open-air nuclear testing, and is not hazardous because of its incredibly long half-life, the longest of all fission products. At the peak of thermonuclear testing in the 1960s and 1970s, iodine-129 still made up only about 10−7 of all natural iodine. Excited states of iodine-127 and iodine-129 are often used in Mössbauer spectroscopy.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{contrasts}} with unsealed source radiotherapy, {{in which a}} therapeutic <b>radionuclide</b> (radioisotope) is injected into the body to chemically localize to the tissue requiring destruction. It also contrasts to EBRT, in which high-energy x-rays (or occasionally gamma-rays from a radioisotope like cobalt-60) are directed at the tumour from outside the body. Brachytherapy instead involves the precise placement of short-range radiation-sources (radioisotopes) directly {{at the site of}} the cancerous tumour. These are enclosed in a protective capsule or wire, which allows the ionizing radiation to escape to treat and kill surrounding tissue but prevents the charge of radioisotope from moving or dissolving in body fluids. The capsule may be removed later, or (with some radioisotopes) it may be allowed to remain in place. A feature of brachytherapy is that the irradiation affects only a very localized area around the radiation sources. Exposure to radiation of healthy tissues farther away from the sources is therefore reduced. In addition, if the patient moves or if there is any movement of the tumour within the body during treatment, the radiation sources retain their correct position in relation to the tumour. These characteristics of brachytherapy provide advantages over EBRT – the tumour can be treated with very high doses of localised radiation whilst reducing the probability of unnecessary damage to surrounding healthy tissues.|$|E
