25|$|The {{design of}} the two Yodo-class cruisers {{differed}} noticeably. Not only was Mogami larger and heavier than Yodo, it also had a straight <b>raked</b> <b>bow</b> with three smokestacks, compared to Yodo which had a clipper bow and two smokestacks. Another {{significant difference between the}} two ships was their propulsion systems, while Yodo had a conventional two shaft, four cylinder reciprocating (VTE) engines with four Miyabara boilers, Mogami has the distinction of being the first Parsons-type turbine-powered vessel in the Imperial Japanese Navy.|$|E
25|$|The {{new ship}} {{improved}} upon {{the design of}} Queen Mary with sufficient changes, including {{a reduction in the}} number of boilers to twelve instead of Mary twenty-four, that the designers could discard one funnel and increase deck, cargo and passenger space. The two funnels were self-supporting and braced internally to give a cleaner looking appearance. With the forward well deck omitted, a more refined hull shape was achieved, and a sharper, <b>raked</b> <b>bow</b> was added for a third bow-anchor point. She was to be eleven feet longer and of 4,000 tons greater displacement than her older sister ship, Mary.|$|E
500|$|Both {{ships were}} rebuilt {{in the late}} 1930s and {{incorporated}} substantial improvements. Both stem and stern were rebuilt, with a new <b>raked</b> <b>bow.</b> Their superstructure was also reconstructed. The old gun armament was replaced {{with a pair of}} [...] 45-caliber guns and four 37mm 40-caliber guns, and Berk-i Satvet received equipment to handle 25 naval mines.|$|E

50|$|A gunnery duel {{followed}} immediately, which damaged Astrées rigging. She {{closed in}} to Iphigénie with Africaine in close pursuit. Africaine, her guns still trained at Astrée, soon found herself {{under fire from}} Iphigénie. After {{half an hour of}} exchanging fire at point-black range, an exchange in which the French had the upper hand, the British attempted a boarding, which Iphigénie easily eluded. The boarding attempt gave Astrée an opportunity to <b>rake</b> Africaines <b>bow.</b> At 4:30, Africaine struck her colours.|$|R
2500|$|The Ilmatar was {{originally}} built with a yacht-like external appearance, with a sleek <b>raked</b> <b>bow</b> and a rounded stern. In {{keeping with the}} ferry design of the day {{she did not have}} a traditional funnel, but two slim exhaust pipes at near the back of the superstructure. The bridge was located on a separate deck on top of the superstructure, almost amidship.

50|$|Humphreys {{had been}} {{appointed}} constructor of frigate United States, and given supervision over the builders of the other frigates. The approved design adhered to the models of vessels built at Middle Atlantic ports, which {{was referred to as}} “Cod’s head and mackerel tail” design, that featured maximum beam foreword of the center of a hull, and tapering to a square stern assembly. Constellation had significant deadrise and sharp <b>raking</b> <b>bow</b> and stern sections below the load waterline. Humphreys' frigates sailed well in light or heavy seas in a weatherly manner despite their square-sail rig. The frigates had architectural elements of a French class of razee frigates that were unlike the more burdensome designs of Royal Navy warships. Constructor David Stodder and Joshua Humphreys shared similar backgrounds that included building fast schooners, brigs and ships during the decades-long period of warlike competition between American and Great Britain’s merchant fleets and the ever-present Royal Navy. Humphreys had no involvement {{in the design of the}} frigate Chesapeake at Gosport Navy Yard, Portsmouth, VA, which was assigned to Josiah Fox after the constructor selected was reassigned and only five frigates - three of large capacity rated 44-guns and the two frigates rated 36-guns, including Constellation - were of Humphreys’ design.|$|R
5|$|Admiral Scheer {{underwent}} a refit while her sister ships {{set out on}} commerce raiding operations in the Atlantic. Admiral Scheer was modified during {{the early months of}} 1940, including the installation of a new, <b>raked</b> clipper <b>bow.</b> The heavy command tower was replaced with a lighter structure, and she was reclassified as a heavy cruiser. Additional anti-aircraft guns were also installed, along with updated radar equipment. On 19–20 July RAF bombers attacked Admiral Scheer and the battleship , though they failed to score any hits. On 27 July, the ship was pronounced ready for service.|$|R

50|$|Between 5 January and 14 February 1988 {{the ship}} was again rebuilt, this time at the Sembawang Shipyard in Singapore. During the refit a new sharply <b>raked</b> <b>bow</b> was fitted, {{increasing}} the ship's length by 3.67 m and the exhaust pipes replaced by a new aluminium funnel. After this rebuilding {{the ship was}} renamed Ocean Pearl by HRH Princess Galyani Vadhana of Thailand.|$|E
50|$|Externally, the 1987-built Astor was {{designed}} to be almost identical to the 1981-built Astor, but approximately 12 m longer. Due to the similar design the ships were distinguishable only due to the additional windows below the first lifeboat on the 1987 ship. Both Astors were designed with a sharply <b>raked</b> <b>bow,</b> a relatively low, terraced superstructure and a large, square funnel.|$|E
5000|$|It was {{concluded}} that all the ship's systems and power plant had performed well during her shakedown, though her cruising speed had been kept well below her maximum speed of 20 knots. Her <b>raked</b> clipper <b>bow</b> had done well in keeping green water off the forward 6" [...] gun turret, even in the very rough sea conditions that had been encountered. Although, {{in addition to the}} damage to her hull plates, there were some issues with Erie's radio direction finder, these were dealt with in early 1937 as she prepared for standardization trials.|$|R
5|$|To the {{surprise}} of Lacrosse and his officers, Indefatigable did not retreat from the ship of the line, nor did she pass the ship of the line at long-range to leeward as expected. Instead, at 17:30, Pellew closed with the stern of Droits de l'Homme and opened a raking fire. Lacrosse turned to meet the threat and opened fire with the guns on the upper deck accompanied by a heavy volley of musket fire from the soldiers on board. Pellew then attempted to pull ahead of Droits de l'Homme and <b>rake</b> her <b>bow,</b> to which Lacrosse responded by attempting to ram Indefatigable. Neither manoeuvre was successful, as Droits de l'Homme raked the British ship but caused little damage as most of her shot scattered into the ocean.|$|R

A gunnery duel followed immediately, in which Astrée had her rigging damaged; she closed in to Iphigénie, Africaine in close pursuit. Africaine soon found herself under fire from Iphigénie at point blank range, her guns still trained at Astrée.

5|$|Constellation sailed {{ahead of}} L'Insurgente and crossed her <b>bow,</b> <b>raking</b> {{her with a}} {{broadside}} as she moved past. Constellation sailed over to gain L'Insurgentes starboard side, and the two ships settled into exchanging broadsides. The French frigate was hulled multiple times, disabling the French vessel's 18-pounder guns while Constellation suffered damage to her rigging. Constellation again sailed ahead of L'Insurgente, reversing course to cross her <b>bow</b> and <b>rake</b> her a second time. Attempts by Barreaut's crew to repair L'Insurgentes rigging were fruitless. Once more Constellation maneuvered to reach L'Insurgentes leeward side. As Constellation crossed the frigate's <b>bow</b> again to <b>rake</b> her a third time, the French ship struck, having sustained too much damage. The engagement had lasted 74 minutes.|$|R
25|$|After {{the victory}} at the Saintes, and {{during a period of}} calm weather, Rodney {{detached}} a squadron under his second in command, Sir Samuel Hood, to pursue some of the crippled French ships. Valiant was one of the ships detached with Hood, and on 19 April the squadron caught two ships of the line and three frigates {{at the entrance to the}} Mona Passage. The French force, consisting of the 64-gun ships Caton and Jason, and the frigates Astree, Aimable and Ceres attempted to escape, Hood signalling for them to be engaged before they could run themselves ashore. In the ensuing Battle of the Mona Passage, Valiant found herself the headmost ship, and with most of the other British ships becalmed or chasing other ships, Goodall pressed on sail to catch the Caton, and managed to <b>rake</b> her <b>bows,</b> on which she immediately struck. Goodall did not stop to take possession, but instead pressed on after the fleeing Jason, opening fire on her and fighting a fierce engagement for 45 minutes until the French ship surrendered. Valiant had 12 men killed and wounded in the action.|$|R
50|$|The Cunard Conquest was {{designed}} with a heavily <b>raked</b> <b>bow</b> and a tapering stern. She {{has a low}} superstructure that extends slightly outward {{from the sides of}} the hull. The open-winged bridge is located two decks above the top deck of the hull. An observation lounge is located above the bridge; a pool area is located aft of the bridge and forward of the heavily raked, round funnel that has a large deflector fin extending aft of the funneltop. The terraced rear superstructure houses additional sundeck areas.|$|E

500|$|Severe {{weather in}} the North Atlantic {{hampered}} Deutschlands raiding mission, though she did tie down several British warships assigned to track her down. The French Force de Raid, centered on the battleship , was occupied with protecting convoys around Britain {{to prevent them from}} being attacked by Deutschland. In early November, the Naval High Command recalled Deutschland; she passed through the Denmark Strait on 15 November and anchored in Gotenhafen on the 17th. In the course of her raiding mission, she sank only two vessels and captured a third. In 1940, the ship underwent a major overhaul, during which a <b>raked</b> clipper <b>bow</b> was installed to improve the sea-keeping qualities of the ship. At this time, she was re-rated as a heavy cruiser and renamed Lützow. Hitler in person made the decision to rename the ship, recognizing the propaganda value of the sinking of a ship that bore the name of its country. Admiral Erich Raeder, the {{commander in chief of the}} Kriegsmarine, also hoped that renaming the ship would confuse Allied intelligence; the [...] was designated for sale to the Soviet Navy, and it was hoped that the usage of her name for Deutschland would hide the transaction. The refit lasted until March 1940, after which it was intended to send the ship on another commerce raiding operation into the South Atlantic. In April, however, she was assigned to forces participating in the invasion of Norway.|$|R
