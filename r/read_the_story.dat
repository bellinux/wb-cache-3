5|$|A {{recurring}} plot {{element is}} {{the depiction of}} Kyle as insecure about Jewish traditions and beliefs. Already regarding God as cruel for allowing him to suffer from a life-threatening hemorrhoid while Cartman enjoys a million-dollar inheritance, Kyle became further appalled after being <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Job. He also once feared damnation for not having grown up as a Catholic. During both instances, he renounced his affiliation with Judaism, only to have his faith restored by events occurring {{at the end of}} an episode. After watching The Passion of the Christ, a shameful Kyle suddenly felt that Cartman's anti-Semitism was justified, and suggested to angry members of his synagogue that the Jews apologize for the death of Jesus. Kyle's guilt is alleviated when he encounters Mel Gibson, the film's director, and perceives him to be a deranged masochist.|$|E
25|$|In its {{immediate}} context, the story follows {{the account of}} Solomon's dream at Gibeon, {{in which he was}} promised by God to be given unprecedented wisdom. Most scholars <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> at face value, and conclude that its major purpose is to demonstrate the fulfillment of the divine promise and to illustrate Solomon's wisdom expressed in a juridical form. Yet some scholars recognize in this story too, as {{in other parts of the}} account of Solomon's reign, ironic elements which are not consistent with the story's overt purpose to glorify Solomon.|$|E

25|$|In the meantime, Dodgson {{had decided}} to rewrite the story as a {{possible}} commercial venture. Probably {{with a view to}} canvassing his opinion, Dodgson sent the manuscript of Under Ground to a friend, the author George MacDonald, in the spring of 1863. The MacDonald children <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and loved it, and this response probably persuaded Dodgson to seek a publisher. Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with illustrations by John Tenniel, was published in 1865, under the name Lewis Carroll. A second book about the character Alice, Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There, followed in 1871. In 1886, a facsimile of Alice's Adventures Under Ground, the original manuscript that Dodgson had given Liddell, was published.|$|E
25|$|GrandPré has {{illustrated}} {{all of the}} American {{editions of}} the Harry Potter novels. She {{was one of the}} few people who were able to read the Harry Potter books before they were released to the general public. When she received each new book, she <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> through once, highlighting descriptions that she felt would do well as an illustration. She then created various sketches as ideas for the cover and chapter art, before sending her favorites to the editors to decide which should appear in the final publication. GrandPré devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.|$|E
500|$|The {{last chapter}} of the novel, {{covering}} Copper's last hunt of Tod, {{was based on the}} story of Boston, a fourteen-month-old bloodhound–foxhound mix, and Old Baldy, a red fox known by hunters for having outrun numerous packs of hounds put on his trail. Mannix originally <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> in a Recreation magazine article, which stated that in December 1887, near the James River in Virginia, Boston hunted a fox referred to as Baldy for a day and a half, covering [...] of terrain. According to Mannix, Boston and Baldy died together, and were buried together once found. In the Recreation article, although Boston survived he never fully recovered and died when he was only three years old. Copper himself was based on the favorite hunting dog of Bee Dee Adkins, a nationally renowned trainer of hunting dogs with whom Mannix hunted. Some of the novel's human characters were based on the lives and mannerisms on locals living in Oro Valley, a suburb of Tucson, Arizona.|$|E

500|$|On 14 October 2005 Eon Productions, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment {{announced}} {{at a press}} conference in London that Daniel Craig would be the sixth actor to portray Bond in the Eon series (although seventh film Bond overall). A tuxedo- and lifejacket-clad Craig arrived via a Royal Navy speedboat. Craig had based his acceptance of the role on the strength of the script for the first film, Casino Royale; he later recalled that [...] "once I sat down and <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> I just thought that I wanted to tell ... I'm a big Bond fan, and I love what he represents". Significant controversy followed the decision, with some critics and fans expressing doubt the producers had made the right choice. Throughout the entire production period, Internet campaigns such as danielcraigisnotbond.com expressed their dissatisfaction and threatened to boycott the film in protest. Craig, unlike previous actors, was not considered by the protesters to fit the tall, dark, handsome and charismatic image of Bond to which viewers had been accustomed. Many disparagingly called him [...] "James Blonde", believing the [...] blond-haired blue-eyed rugged Craig to be far fitting from the traditional tall, dark and suave actors who had earlier portrayed him. The Daily Mirror ran a front-page news story critical of Craig, with the headline, The Name's Bland – James Bland.|$|E
500|$|The one reel format {{was very}} {{restrictive}} {{in terms of}} allowing complex plots to be told while still being showing action in the production. The release of St. Elmo in March 22, 1910 was the first adaptation and second film to be released by the Thanhouser Company. The film was reviewed by critics to be too reliant {{on the use of}} inter-titles to tell the story. The company's adaptation of The Winter's Tale would require foreknowledge of the plot to understand the film, but some theaters employed aids to inform the audience of such productions By the adaptation of Uncle Tom's Cabin the coherency in the story was praised by critics, but this story was both popular and well-known subject. The Moving Picture World review provides specific insight to the Thanhouser adaptation's ability to convey the story to audiences: [...] "To those who have read Lena Rivers with pleasure the picture will be more than ordinarily entertaining. To those who have not <b>read</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> the film presents a narrative not without its interest in offering a quarter hour's diversion well worthwhile." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror would commend the picture for its acting and also confirm the adaptations coherency, [...] "The well-known novel is adapted for a film story with considerable success in this picture. The story is clear and not too complicated, although the film covers all the essential points of the written story." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his work}} Best Books for Beginning Readers, Thomas G. Gunning places Don't Forget the Bacon! within {{the themes of}} utilising humor in the {{learning}} process with children. Don't Forget the Bacon! {{has been used as a}} learning tool for children in education, in order to teach them about various themes including miscommunication, , and the reliability of spoken language. In an analysis of teaching tools for remedial readers, Maurice Saxby notes in the book Books in the Life of a Child: Bridges to Literature & Learning, [...] "Hutchins's Don't Forget the Bacon has been one of my most successful texts." [...] The book is utilised in author Andrea Hillbrick's Tuning in with Task Cards as a teaching lesson: children are assigned to collect items from the initial and final versions of the shopping list from the boy in the story, and subsequently total the prices of the tabulated items.
