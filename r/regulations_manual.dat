First, we will deploy the principles of software development that we have learned through the Software Engineering track here at NPS and test its validity {{through the development of}} a real world system.

The new system will address all aspects currently outlined in the regulations. This regulation will be used by all US civilians and military service members to whom the current manual is now relevant. Although we fully intend to deliver a finished product to the Marine Corps for their official use, the true value to us as students is in the process of developing and testing this new system.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: The Gauteng Province in South Africa {{is home to}} {{four large}} {{hospitals}} which generate enormous amounts of waste. However, no formal study {{has been done to}} asses the magnitude of this problem. Health care waste falls under a cluster of waste which is regarded as hazardous due to its composition and therefore ability to transmit disease. It has become an important type of waste mainly because of its ability to transmit HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B and C among other infectious diseases. This study attempted to address the knowledge and practices of doctors and nurses, which {{are just some of the}} factors which influence health care waste management. Aims: The main aim of this study was to evaluate the current knowledge and practices of doctors and nurses regarding the management of health care waste. Methods: This was a descriptive cross sectional study. A self administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. A total sample of 128 doctors and nurses was drawn from the Johannesburg Hospital, an academic hospital in the Gauteng Province. Results: Although there was overall lack of awareness about the existence of the international, national, provincial and local documents (Act, <b>Regulation,</b> <b>Manual,</b> Code of Practice and Policies) regulating heath care waste management, the majority of the respondents (84...|$|R

As a result, three publications, including print and non-print deliverables, were developed and distributed: (1) Series of Backgrounders, Web Services for WIPP; (2) A Guide to Foreign Research Reactor Spent Fuel; and (3) A Guide to the US Department of Energy's Low-Level Radioactive Waste. DOE and its predecessor agencies have maintained a record of safe transportation of radioactive materials for more than 50 years. Thousands of shipments involving three million packages of radioactive materials are shipped each year in the United States. Historically, DOE shipments constitute less than one percent of the total radioactive material shipments; however, they comprise a significant portion (approaching 75 percent) of the curies, or amounts of radioactivity shipped annually. DOE operations and field offices are responsible for detailed planning and for ensuring full regulatory compliance for their shipments. Packaging is designed to protect workers and limit the risk to the public during transportation. DOE headquarters and program offices provide policy direction and oversight for packaging and transportation activities for their respective offices.

CMS reports that mandatory reporting was pushed back from 2009 to 2011 for some NGHPs and from 2009 to 2012 for others, in part due to concerns raised by the industry. GAO was asked to present background information about the MSP process as it pertains to NGHPs. To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant CMS documentation, including MSP <b>regulations,</b> <b>manuals,</b> and user guides, and conducted an interview with CMS related to mandatory reporting and the MSP process.
