40|$|We {{report a}} bi-polar {{multiple}} periodic negative differential conductance (NDC) {{effect on a}} single cage-shaped Ru nanoparticle measured using scanning tunneling spectroscopy. This phenomenon is assigned to the unique multiply-connected cage architecture providing two (or more) defined <b>routes</b> for <b>charge</b> flow through the cage. This, in turn, promotes a self- gating effect, where electron <b>charging</b> of one <b>route</b> affects <b>charge</b> transport along a neighboring channel, yielding a series of periodic NDC peaks.

5000|$|Liner {{companies}} {{responded to}} their overcapacity in several ways. For example, in early 2009, some container lines dropped their freight rates to zero on the Asia-Europe <b>route,</b> <b>charging</b> shippers only a surcharge to cover operating costs. [...] They decreased their overcapacity {{by lowering the}} ships' speed (a strategy called [...] "slow steaming") and by laying up ships. [...] Slow steaming increased {{the length of the}} Europe-Asia routes to a record high of over 40 days. [...] Another strategy used by some companies was to manipulate the market by publishing notices of rate increases in the press, and when [...] "a notice had been issued by one carrier, other carriers followed suit." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{village of}} Fouchy (Groba) is first {{documented}} around 1150, {{at which time}} the village {{was part of the}} patrimony of the Convent of St Faith in Sélestat. Originally the settlement would have been located in a clearing, supported by a few fields cleared from the surrounding woodlands. Some value would have come to the convent from the economic potential of the woodlands, but the valley had also a considerable strategic importance. Linking Alsace to Lorraine along the route through Villé and Urbeis, the route had commercial significance in that it provided an alternative route for the important trade in salt from nearby deposits {{in the eastern part of}} Lorraine. The salt trade otherwise was dependent of the state of Steige Pass, which would have presented challenges during the cold wet weather that is still a frequent feature of the weather in this region. The convent exploited the Fouchy <b>route,</b> <b>charging</b> a toll for merchandise conveyed along it.|$|R

50|$|In 1990, the country's highest-traffic {{roads were}} granted {{the right to}} collect tolls, and were divided into Road Corridors for this purpose.
