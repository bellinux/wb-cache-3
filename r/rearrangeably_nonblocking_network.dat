A distributed control routing algorithm with time complexity O(log 2 N) has been proposed recently in which authors have considered N completely connected processors to take routing decision which practically {{would be very difficult}} to implement for large N. In this paper we propose two distributed control routing algorithms where processors are loosely connected. In the first algorithm O (N) processors work in pipelined fashion, and take the routing decision in linear time.

40|$|Banyan {{networks}} are attractive for constructing directional coupler (DC) -based optical switching networks for their small depth and self-routing capability. Crosstalk between optical signals {{passing through the}} same DC is an intrinsic drawback in DC-based optical networks. Vertical stacking of multiple copies of an optical banyan network is a novel scheme for building nonblocking (crosstalk-free) optical switching networks. The resulting network, namely vertically stacked optical banyan (VSOB) network, preserves all {{the properties of the}} banyan network, but increases the hardware cost significantly. Though much work has been done for determining the minimum number of stacked copies (planes) required for a <b>nonblocking</b> VSOB <b>network,</b> little is known on analyzing the blocking probabilities of VSOB networks that do not meet the nonblocking condition (i. e., with fewer stacked copies than required by the nonblocking condition). In this paper, we analyze the blocking probabilities of VSOB networks and develop their upper and lower bounds with respect to the number of planes in the networks. These bounds depict accurately the overall blocking behaviors of VSOB networks and agree with the conditions of strictly <b>nonblocking</b> and <b>rearrangeably</b> <b>nonblocking</b> VSOB <b>networks</b> respectively. Extensive simulation on a network simulator with both random routing and packing strategy has shown that the blocking probabilities of both strategies fall nicely within our bounds, and the blocking probability of packing strategy actually matches the lower bound. The proposed bounds are significant because they reveal the inherent relationships between blocking probability and network hardware cost {{in terms of the number}} of planes, and provide network developers a quantitative guidance to trade blocking probability for hardware cost. In particular, our bounds provide network designers an effective tool to estimate the minimum and maximum blocking probabilities of VSOB networks in which different routing strategies may be applied. An interesting conclusion drawn from our work that has practical applications is that the hardware cost of a VSOB network can be reduced dramatically if a predictable and almost negligible nonzero blocking probability is allowed.

40|$|Abstract—We provide network {{designs for}} optical add–drop wavelength-division-multiplexed (OADM) rings that {{minimize}} overall network cost, {{rather than just}} the number of wavelengths needed. The network cost includes {{the cost of the}} transceivers required at the nodes as well as the number of wavelengths. The transceiver cost includes the cost of terminating equipment as well as higher-layer electronic processing equipment, which in practice can dominate over the cost of the number of wavelengths in the network. The networks support dynamic (i. e., time-varying) traffic streams that are at lower rates (e. g., OC- 3, 155 Mb/s) than the lightpath capacities (e. g., OC- 48, 2. 5 Gb/s). A simple OADM ring is the point-to-point ring, where traffic is transported on WDM links optically, but switched through nodes electronically. Although the network is efficient in using link bandwidth, it has high electronic and opto-electronic processing costs. Two OADM ring networks are given that have similar performance but are less expensive. Two other OADM ring networks are considered that are nonblocking, where one has a wide-sense nonblocking property and the other has a <b>rearrangeably</b> <b>nonblocking</b> property.

In this paper, we study the realization of crosstalk-free permutations in <b>rearrangeably</b> <b>nonblocking,</b> self-routing banyan-type optical MINs built on vertical stacking. An available scheme for realizing crosstalk-free permutation {{in this type of}} optical MINs requires to first decompose a permutation into multiple crosstalk-free partial permutations based on the Euler-Split technique, and then to realize them crosstalk-free in different planes (stacked copies) of the MIN simultaneously. The overall time complexity of this scheme to realize a crosstalk-free permutation in an N × N optical MIN is O(N log N) which is dominated by the complexity of crosstalk-free decomposition. In this paper, we propose a new scheme for realizing permutations in this class of vertically stacked optical MINs crosstalk-free. The basic idea of the new scheme is to classify permutations into permutation classes such that all permutations in one class share the same crosstalk-free decomposition pattern. By running the Euler-Split based crosstalk-free decomposition only once for a permutation class and applying the obtained crosstalk-free decomposition pattern to all permutations in the class, crosstalk-free decomposition of permutations can be realized in a more efficient way. We show that the number of permutations in a permutation class is huge (N!) N when log 2 N is even and (2 N!)

PAD (photonic architecture designer) generates higher order architecture by taking a lower order architecture as a <b>rearrangeably</b> <b>nonblocking</b> unit cell used as a building block. It then proceeds to test the generated netlist for nonblocking capability. PAL (photonic architecture layout optimizer) takes a given architecture as input and finds the optimal layout with respect to coupled power between waveguides, substrate real estate utilization and number of crossovers. The directional coupler is taken as the unit cell and perturbed (translated/rotated) till the cost functions described above are satisfied. The inter-connecting waveguides are treated as semi-elastic structures which satisfy constraints like minimum intersection angle, interguide spacing and minimum radii for bends in integrated optic waveguides. Several practical constraints are imposed on the layout algorithm to ensure a realistic layout design...|$|R
40|$|Asymptotically <b>nonblocking</b> <b>networks</b> are O(log 2 N) depth {{self-routing}} permutation de-vices {{in which}} blocking probability vanishes when N (the number of network inputs) in-creases. This behavior does not guarantee, also for very large N, that all information always and simultaneously reaches its destination (and consequently that a whole permuta-tion {{passes through the}} device) which is a requirement of the PRAM machine. In this work the conditions for which an asymptotically <b>nonblocking</b> <b>network</b> becomes asymptotically permutation nonblocking are studied, finally a virtually nonblocking device is obtained by a retransmission procedure which guarantees that all permutations always pass through this permutation device. 1...|$|R
40|$|Absfruct- The {{performance}} of a multiprocessor system de-pends heavily {{on its ability to}} provide conflict free paths among its processors. In this paper, we explore the possibility of us-ing a <b>nonblocking</b> <b>network</b> with O (N log N) edges (crosspoints) to interconnect the processors of an N processor system. We combine Bassalygo and Pinsker's implicit design of strictly non-blocking networks with an explicit construction of expanders to obtain a strictly <b>nonblocking</b> <b>network</b> with- 765. 18 N + 352. 8 N log N edges and 2 + log(N/ 5) depth. We present an efficient parallel algorithm for routing connection requests on this network and implement it on three parallel processor topologies. The implementation on a parallel processor whose processing elements are interconnected as in the Bassalyg-Pinsker network requires O (N log N) processing elements, O (N log N) interpro-cessor links and it takes O(1 ogN) steps to route any single connection request where each step involves a small number (~ 7 2) of bit-level operations. A contracted or folded version of the same implementation reduces the processing element count to O (N) without increasing the link count or the routing time. Finally, we establish that the same algorithm takes O(10 g 3 N) steps on a perfect shuffle processor with O (N) processing ele-ments. These results improve the crosspoint, depth and routing time complexities of the previously reported strictly <b>nonblocking</b> <b>networks.</b> Index Terms-Bassalygo-Pinsker network, Clos network, Can-tor network, extensive graph, expander, parallel routing algo-rithm, strictly <b>nonblocking</b> <b>network.</b> I...|$|R
