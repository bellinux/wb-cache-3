50|$|Under the Terms of Reference for {{the review}} panel, the Panel was to obtain {{all of the}} {{information}} it required in order to prepare its report to the Minister of the Environment. In doing this, the Panel encouraged participation of government agencies, members of the public, and Aboriginal groups throughout the process. Participants had the opportunity to comment and provide their views to the Panel on whether the EIS and license application documents from OPG adequately addressed the requirements set out in the EIS Guidelines issued to OPG by the federal government. Throughout the process, public hearings were held in both Kincardine and Saugeen Shores, Ontario, and public comments were accepted online through the Canadian Environmental Assessment Registry. Funding was given to participants through CEAA’s Participant Funding Program, giving groups the opportunity to have their comments heard throughout the process. The Panel also issued a total of 515 <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> <b>additional</b> <b>information</b> to OPG in order to obtain information requirement to meet the requirements of the EIS Guidelines.The Joint Review Panel published their 450-page Environmental Assessment Report endorsing the DGR project proposal on May 6, 2015. The Panel report , which was delivered to the Minister of the Environment, summarized the information received by the Panel, including comments from participants, and the Panel’s conclusions related to the purpose, need and alternatives; design features and project development; waste management; effects on the natural environment; effects on human health and safety; malfunctions, accidents, and malevolent acts; social and economic aspects; Aboriginal interests, rights, and title; post-closure safety case; Lake Huron and the Great Lakes; and cumulative effects. The Panel concluded that the project was not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects, taking into account the implementation of the mitigation measures committed to by OPG together with the mitigation measures recommended by the Panel.|$|E
