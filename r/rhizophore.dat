40|$|The {{occurrence}} of thickened underground systems in Asteraceae is widely {{reported in the}} literature. Given the great complexity of underground systems, which may originate from roots, stems, or both, morpho-anatomical analyses are essential to ensure the use of correct terminology. The goals {{of this study were}} to describe the morpho-anatomy and ontogeny, investigate the {{occurrence of}} secondary metabolites and evaluate the effects of seasonality on the underground system of Chrysolaena simplex (Less.) Dematt. Samples were studied using standard protocols of plant anatomy, scanning electron microscopy, histochemical and phytochemical. The underground system of C. simplex was categorised as a <b>rhizophore</b> which started from cotyledonary node. In adult individuals, with rhizophores completely developed, the primary roots degenerated and adventitious radicular systems are formed. The buds in the subterranean portions promote the <b>rhizophore</b> growing, and form aerial stems when exposed to light. Lipophilic droplets were evident in the parenchymatous cells of the cortex and pith, endodermis and buds. Inulin-type fructans were observed in the stem axis and buds of the <b>rhizophore.</b> The presence of buds, secondary metabolites and the storage of fructans and lipids in the <b>rhizophore</b> can be seen as adaptive traits...|$|E
40|$|The <b>rhizophore</b> of Selaginella willdenovii Baker {{develops}} {{from the}} ventral angle meristem. The morphological {{nature of this}} organ has been in dispute. The purpose {{of this investigation was}} to obtain physiological evidence to support the contention that the <b>rhizophore</b> is a root and not a shoot. This was accomplished by studying the movement of 3 H-indoleacetic acid and 14 C-indoleacetic acid in Selaginella rhizophores. In 6 -millimeter tissue segments, twice as much radioactivity accumulated in acropetal receivers as in basipetal. During 1 hour of transport in intact roots auxin traveled twice as far in the acropetal direction as basipetal. A significant amount of radioactivity transported in the tissue was found to co-chromatograph with cold indoleacetic acid. Decarboxylation accounted for 10 % loss of activity from donors. The data provide sufficient physiological evidence that this organ is morphogenetically a root...|$|E
40|$|As plantas do gênero Cordyline possuem estruturas caulinares peculiares geralmente chamadas de rizoma. Um autor do início do século XX sugeriu que havia uma relação entre esse órgão de Cordyline e o órgão formador de raiz de Selaginella. O termo rizóforo foi originalmente cunhado para Selaginella e significa ó̈rgão portador de raízesë também passou a ser aplicado aos órgãos caulinares subterrâneos de Vernonia, Dioscorea e Smilax e ao que tradicionalmente era chamado de raiz aérea em Rhizophora mangle. Recentemente admitiu-se que as estruturas de Cordyline fruticosa são rízóforos, mas nenhum estudo de desenvolvimento foi apresentado a fim de confirmar tal hipótese. Rizóforo é um caule com geotropismo positivo não originário da plúmula do embrião, presente em plantas com sistema caulinar bipolar de ramificação, isto é, a planta possui ramos aéreos, as quais tem geotropismo negativo e formam folhas, e ramos basais, os quais tem geotropismo positivo e formam raízes. Em Cordyline, os rizóforos se desenvolvem a partir de gemas laterais e possuem crescimento secundário do mesmo modo que o eixo aéreo. O espessamento do caule de Cordyline já foi amplamente analisado em sua porção aérea, mas trabalhos a respeito da porção caulinar subterrânea são mais escassos. Esse espessamento é resultado direto e indireto da atuação do periciclo. No corpo primário, o periciclo produz tecido {{vascular}} adicional aumentando o diâmetro do caule concomitante com a atividade meristemática da endoderme. O periciclo ainda é o responsável pela formação do MES, o qual proporciona o espessamento secundário e atua de maneira semelhante na porção aérea e no rizóforo, com pequena variação. A vascularização das raízes adventícias conecta-se à vascularização do caule pelo periciclo durante o crescimento primário e pelo MES durante o crescimento secundário. As características morfológicas e anatômicas do rizóforo estão diretamente relacionadas com uma maior produção de raízes, assim, sua principal função é o aumento da rizosfera. Outras funções importantes dessa estrutura é o acúmulo de reservas e a reprodução vegetativa. O presente estudo averiguou a natureza dos órgãos subterrâneos de Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis e C, spectabilis, através de estudos anatômicos e observações do desenvolvimento ontogenético. Plants of {{the genus}} Cordyline possess distinctive caulinar structures usually known as rhizomes. An author from {{the early twentieth century}} suggested that there was a relationship between this organ in Cordyline and the root-generating organ in Selaginella. The term <b>rhizophore</b> - meaning r̈oot-bearing organ-̈ was coined originally for Selaginella and was later applied to the subterranean stem organs of Vernonia, Dioscorea and Smilax and to the structures traditionally known as aerial roots in Rhizophora mangle. Recently, these structures in Cordyline fruticosa have been categorized as rhizophores, but this hypothesis has not previously been confirmed by any published developmental study. A <b>rhizophore</b> is a stem with positive geotropism which does not arise from the plumule of the embryo, and is present in plants with a stem system having bipolar branching, i. e. with aerial branches, which have negative geotropism and form leaves, and basal branches, which have positive geotropism and form roots. The rhizophores of Cordyline develop from lateral buds and have secondary growth of the same type as in the aerial axis. The stem thickening of Cordyline has already been extensively studied in its aerial parts, but there are few such studies regarding the subterranean part of the stem. This thickening is the direct and indirect result of the activity of the pericycle. In the primary body, the pericycle produces additional vascular tissue, which increases the diameter of the stem concomitant with the meristematic activity of the endodermis. The pericycle is also responsible for the generation of the STM, which provides the secondary thickening and functions in a similar way in the aerial stem and the <b>rhizophore,</b> with little variation. The adventitious roots vascular tissue are connected to the vascular system of the stem by the pericycle during primary growth and by the STM during secondary growth. The morphological and anatomical features of the <b>rhizophore</b> are directly related to an increased production of roots, and thus its main function is the rhizosphere expansion. Beside that, the <b>rhizophore</b> is important as a storage organ and vegetative reproduction. The present study investigated the structure of the subterranean organs of Cordyline fruticosa, C. australis and C. spectabilis by anatomical techniques and observations of their ontogenetic development...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of climatic variations on fructan content in tropical regions {{is not well}} known. The present study deals {{with the effects of}} temperature on fructan contents in <b>rhizophores</b> of plants of Vernonia herbacea, a native species from the Brazilian cerrado vegetation. Intact plants and fragmented <b>rhizophores</b> were subjected to different temperatures under natural and controlled environmental conditions. <b>Rhizophores</b> of plants in pre-dormant stage (aerial parts showing some yellowish leaves) presented higher fructan content at 5 oC than those kept at 25 oC, whereas in dormant plants (aerial parts absent) temperature treatments did not affect fructan contents. Fragmented <b>rhizophores</b> obtained from dormant plants presented higher levels of fructo-polysaccharides {{at the end of the}} experiment than at the beginning of the treatment, regardless of the temperature they were stored, whereas fragments obtained from vegetative plants showed a decrease in fructan content under the same treatments. It was concluded that variations observed in fructan contents are related to the phenological state of the plants prior to the treatment rather than to extraneous temperatures they are subjected to during this stage...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the involvement of fructans in drought tolerance, experiments were conducted using intact plants and excised <b>rhizophores</b> of Vernonia herbacea.

Total fructan, oligo- to polysaccharides ratio and mean molecular mass of polysaccharides increased in these plants indicating depolymerization of median size molecules. In apical fragments of <b>rhizophores</b> kept dry the oligosaccharides increased in relation to polysaccharides one day after excision in treated tissues.

40|$|A {{study on}} the {{vegetative}} organ anatomy of Ianthopappus corymbosus was conducted {{in order to provide}} a basis for comparison with the genus Richterago, since this species had been previously included in that genus. The anatomical characters of I. corymbosus that support its exclusion from the genus Richteragon are: epithelial cell organization of adventitious root secretory canals, non-glandular trichomes, and presence of cortical vascular bundles in the stem. In Ianthopappus corymbosus, the underground system consists of <b>rhizophore</b> from which adventitious roots branch off. The subapical meristem of the adventitious root revealed that the ground meristem forms the inner layer which in a meristematic phase, forms 2 / 3 of the cortex. This layer will differentiate in the endodermis, with Casparian strips, and is referred to as meristematic endodermis.

40|$|Brazilians {{have been}} using the {{underground}} organs of Smilax species in alternative medicine since the 19 th century because of their anti-rheumatic qualities. However, even nowadays, these species are explored only by extractivism. Studies on seed germination and development of these organs could be useful to preserve these plants. After germination, seedling development of Smilax polyantha was analyzed to understand underground stem formation. Furthermore, to analyze the ontogenesis of the underground system, seedlings aged from one to twelve months were sectioned. One {{of the most striking}} features of this species is the presence of two stem branching systems. The plumule gives rise to the first stem branching system with negative geotropism. Its first underground axillary bud sprouted into the other caulinar axis with positive geotropism. The horizontal growth and the subsequent thickening of this underground organ depended on the development of axillary buds from basal nodes of the previous branches.

These variations indicate the occurrence of active inulin synthesis and depolymerization throughout the cycle and a role for this carbohydrate as a reserve compound. 1 -Fructan exohydrolase (1 -FEH) is the enzyme responsible for inulin depolymerization, and its activity has been detected in <b>rhizophores</b> of sprouting plants. Defoliation and low temperature are enhancer conditions of this 1 -FEH activity. The aim of the present work was the cloning of this enzyme. <b>Rhizophores</b> were collected from plants induced to sprout, followed by storage at 5 C.

40|$|<b>Rhizophores</b> of Vernonia herbacea, an Asteraceae {{found in}} the Brazilian Cerrado, store high amounts of fructans that vary in {{composition}} over the phenological cycle. Fructan 1 -exohydrolase (1 -FEH) activity is detectable during the sprouting phase, mainly in the proximal regions of <b>rhizophores,</b> of plants induced to sprout by defoliation and/or cold storage. We found an increase in 1 -FEH gene expression during natural and induced sprouting and further enhancement through low-temperature treatment. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of 1 -FEH gene expression in {{different regions of the}} <b>rhizophores</b> during the transition from dormancy to sprouting is presented. Transcripts were detected mainly in the proximal region, coinciding with high 1 -FEH activity and a high concentration of free fructose. Low temperature promoted the accumulation of fructans of a low degree of polymerization (DP) and enhanced 1 -FEH activity and gene expression. It is hypothesized that a set of 1 -FEH proteins acts in two different ways during fructan mobilization: (1) by hydrolyzing fructo-oligosaccharides and -polysaccharides in sprouting plants (naturally or induced) for carbon supply and (2) by hydrolyzing preferably fructo-polysaccharides under low temperature to maintain the oligosaccharide pool for plant cold acclimation.

40|$|In {{contrast}} with the abundance of anatomical studies of secretory structures on aerial vegetative organs of Asteraceae species, the information about secretory structures on thickened subterranean organs is sparse. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the occurrence of secretory structures on thickened and nonthickened subterranean organs of seven Asteraceae species from three tribes: Eupatorieae (Chromolaena squalida and Gyptis lanigera), Vernonieae (Chresta sphaerocephala, Lessingianthus bardanoides, L. glabratus and Orthopappus angustifolius), and Plucheeae (Pterocaulon angustifolium). The specimens were collected in areas of cerrado, from the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. All species of the tribe Vernonieae studied exhibited endodermic cells, other than the epithelial cells of the canal, with secretory activity in the roots. In C. sphaerocephala roots, two types of endodermic cell were found, but only one had secretory activity. Secretory canals were found in the tuberous and nontuberous roots of all studied species. These data agree with the results from the literature for Asteraceae species. Here, we describe for the first time in Asteraceae the presence of secretory idioblasts in C. sphaerocephala.

40|$|The {{underground}} {{organs of}} Vernonia herbacea (Vell.) Rusby, known as rhizophores, acumulate 80 % of their dry mass as fructans of the inulin type. In {{view of the}} growing industrial use of fructans as dietetic and general food products, and of their medical application, the present investigation aimed at evaluating the effect of mineral fertilization and period of cultivation on the production of these carbohydrates in field trials. Plants used in the experiments were obtained by vegetative propagation from rhizophores collected from plants growing in natural areas of the cerrado, and cultivated for two years.

40|$|AbstractThe {{species of}} the genus Smilax, popularly known as sarsaparilla, are widely used in folk {{medicine}} due to the antirheumatic properties of its underground structures. Smilax fluminensis and S. syphilitica occur in forested areas and form thickened stems called <b>rhizophores</b> from which adventitious roots grow. To provide information for more accurate identification of the commercialised product and for elucidating the process of stem thickening, a morphology and anatomy study of the underground organs of the two species was conducted. The adventitious roots differ in colour and diameter depending {{on the stage of}} development. They are white and have a larger diameter {{in the early stages of}} development, but as they grow, the adventitious roots become brown and have a smaller diameter due to the disintegration of the epidermis and virtually the entire cortex. In brown roots, the covering function is then performed by the lignified endodermis and the remaining walls of the cells from the last parenchyma cortical layer. These results are similar to those found in studies of other Smilax and suggest that the anatomy of the roots can be useful for identifying fraud in commercialised materials. The thickening process of the nodal regions of the <b>rhizophores</b> in both species involves the activity of axillary buds and pericyclic layers...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{occurrence}} of glandular trichomes is frequently reported for aerial vegetative organs, many questions still remain opened {{about the presence of}} such trichomes in underground systems. Here, we present, for the first time, a comparative study concerning the structure, ultrastructure and chemical aspects of both, the aerial and underground glandular trichomes of two different Chrysolaena species, C obovata and C platensis. Glandular trichomes (GTs) were examined using LM, SEM, and TEM and also analyzed by GC-MS and HPLC coupled to UV/DAD and HR-ESI-MS (HPLC-UV-MS). In both aerial (leaf and bud) and underground (<b>rhizophore)</b> organs, the GTs are multicellular, biseriate and formed by five pairs of cells: a pair of support cells, a pair of basal cells, and three pairs of secreting cells. These secreting cells have, at the beginning of secretory process, abundance of smooth ER. The same classes of secondary metabolites are biosynthesized and stored in both aerial and underground GTs of C platensis and C obovata. These GTs from aerial and underground organs have similar cellular and sub-cellular anatomy, however the belowground trichomes show a higher diversity of compounds when compared to those from the leaves. We also demonstrate by means of HPLC-UV-DAD that the sesquiterpene lactones are located inside the trichomes and that hirsutinolides are not artifacts. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

40|$|Chrysolaena obovata (Less.) Dematt., {{previously}} named Vernonia herbacea, is an Asteraceae {{native to}} the Cerrado which accumulates about 80 % of the <b>rhizophore</b> dry mass as inulin-type fructans. Considering its high inulin production and the wide application of fructans, a protocol for C. obovata in vitro culture was recently established. Carbohydrates are essential for in vitro growth and development of plants and can also act as signaling molecules involved in cellular adjustments and metabolic regulation. This work aimed to evaluate the effect of different sources of carbohydrate on fructan metabolism in plants grown in vitro. For this purpose, C. obovata plants cultivated in vitro were submitted to carbon deprivation and transferred to MS medium supplemented with sucrose, glucose or fructose. Following, their fructan composition and activity and expression of genes encoding enzymes for fructan synthesis (1 -SST and 1 -FFT) and degradation (1 -FEH) were evaluated. For qRT-PCR analysis partial cDNA sequences encoding two different C. obovata genes, 1 -SST and 1 -FFT, were isolated. As expected, C. obovata sequences showed highest sequence identity to other Asteraceae 1 -SST and 1 -FFT, than to Poaceae related proteins. A carbon deficit treatment stimulated the transcription of the gene 1 -FEH and inhibited 1 -SST and 1 -FFT and carbohydrate supplementation promoted reversal of the expression profile of these genes. With the exception of 1 -FFT, {{a positive correlation between}} enzyme activity and gene expression was observed. The overall results indicate that sucrose, fructose and glucose act similarly on fructan metabolism and that 1 -FEH and 1 -SST are transcriptionally regulated by sugar in this species. Cultivation of plants in increasing sucrose concentrations stimulated synthesis and inhibited fructan mobilization, and induced a distinct pattern of enzyme activity for 1 -SST and 1 -FFT, indicating the existence of a mechanism for differential regulation between them...|$|E

Seven plots were established in different sites in southern Brazil: frequently burned (FB) and excluded from fire since 6 years (E). All plots were subjected to controlled burns during summer. Before experiments, populations were sampled. Further observations were carried out after 90 and after 360 days of fire experiments. In addition, we counted the number of seedlings and resprouters recruited after fire. Heat shock experiments were conducted with two species (H. psiadioides and V. flexuosa), as well as the study of the bud bank of the following species: E. ligulaefolium and V. flexuosa. The obligate seeder species had all individuals killed by fire and established only after 1 year. Resprouters, however, showed new stems immediately after fire. E. ligulaefolium and V. flexuosa showed only vegetative regeneration from belowground organs and more individuals in excluded sites 1 year after the fire. The bud bank of E. ligulaefolium tended to be larger in excluded sites, whilst V. flexuosa showed an opposite result. High temperatures did not enhance nor kill seeds from both studied species. Vegetative regeneration was the most important strategy for all studied species, except for H. psiadioides, the obligate seeder species.

Soc. 137 : 220 - 235. 2010. -New {{approaches}} to underground systems in Brazilian Smilax species (Smilacaceae). Scientific {{studies show that}} the watery extract of the thickened underground stem and its adventitious roots of the genus Smilax can act as a therapeutic agent in immunoinflammatory disorders, such as rheumatic arthritis. Brazilians have used this genus of plants in folk medicine, however {{it is very hard to}} identify these species, since the morphology of the underground systems is very similar in this group. For better identification of those systems, we studied six species of Smilax L. (S. brasiliensis, S. campestris, S. cissoides, S. goyazana, S. oblongifolia and S. rufescens), collected in different regions of Brazil with different physiognomies and soil characteristics. The main purpose is to describe the morpho-anatomy of the underground systems and to analyze if their structure depends on environmental conditions. The underground stem (<b>rhizophore)</b> is of brown color and it is knotty, massive, slender (S. rufescens) or tuberous (S. brasiliensis, S. campestris, S. cissoides, S. goyazana and S. oblongifolia). The tuberization is a result of primary thickened meristem (PTM) activity. The color and thickness of the adventitious roots change during development because the epidermis and outer cortex are disposed of, so the inner cortex becomes the new covering tissue with lignified and dark color cells. There are differences in starch grain shapes in mature roots. The chemical attributes of the soil are very similar in all studied environments and, even when soil characteristics varied, all the species` underground system was distributed close to the soil surface (10 to 15 cm deep). The species exhibited clonal growth hence their underground system functions as storage structures and the axillary buds can sprout into new stems. Only Smilax rufescens, collected in sandy soil of Restinga, has vegetative dispersal due to the runners.

40|$|Herbaceous, perennial, {{submerged}} aquatics or marsh plants, usually with annual grass-like leaves arising in a tuft from a lobed, flattened, corm-like stock. Stock divided into stem and <b>rhizophore,</b> 2 — 4 -lobed, with black dichotomous roots {{arising from the}} furrows between two lobes. Roots monarch, with the stele attached {{to one side of}} a central cavity, vascular system protostelic, 2 — 4 - lobed at base. Leaves distichous, crowded, with overlapping bases, terete or flattened above, with a broad spoon-like base. Blades with a simple trace and median, unbranched vein, accessory peripheral strands often present; mesophyll chambered with four longitudinal cavities divided by transverse diaphragms, Which give the leaf a muriform appearance when seen in transmitted light. Stomata present on one or both surfaces in some species and absent in others. Leaf-bases usually membranaceous and hyaline but in some species persistent as hard, brown, 2 -lobed, horny structures. Ligule present near the base of the leaf above the sporangium, arising from a cavity called the ligular pit, cordate-triangular or subulate, 2 — 15 mm long, without chlorophyll or cuticle, secreting mucilage at least when young. All leaves potentially sporophyll with a sporangium seated in a pit (fovea) on the adaxial surface below the ligule. Megasporophylls normally arising below the microsporophylls; opening of fovea often wholly or partly covered by a membrane (velum) extending downwards from the apex. Sporangia large, 4 — 7 mm long, oblong, thin-walled (walls with 3 — 4 layers of cells), subdivided irregularly and incompletely by oblique sterile plates (trabeculae); of two kinds, megasporangia and microsporangia, sessile and broadly adnate. Sporangia with both megaspores and microspores have been reported and the megaspores often vary considerably in size. Megasporangium containing 50 — 300 trilete spores, 250 — 900 μ in diam., white, grey or black, smooth or with warts, spines, or ridges. Microspores monolete, elliptic, 20 - 45 μ long, smooth or papillose, 150. 000 — 1. 000. 000 in each sporangium. Annulus wanting, spores released by the decay of sporangial walls. Some species may be aposporous with young plants taking the place of the developing sporangia. Gametophytes dioecious. Female prothallus green, development starting within and the prothallus remaining attached to the wall of the megaspore. Archegonia one or more up to 30, deeply sunken. Rhizoids present, projecting beyond the spore wall. Male gametophyte arising within the microspore, consisting of only a single prothallial cell and an antheridium, with 4 peripheral cells and 4 central cells, each giving rise to a single antherozoid with 15 flagellae.

About 75 spp., {{in all parts of the}} world except the Pacific Islands (present in Tasmania and New Zealand), but mainly temperate, scarce in Asia, in Malaysia 3 spp., one in the hills and tw...|$|E
40|$|The {{division}} of the apical meristem into two independently functioning axes is defined as dichotomous branching. This type of branching typically occurs in non-vascular and non-seed vascular plants, whereas in seed plants it presents a primary growth form only in several taxa. Dichotomy is a complex process, which requires a re-organization of the meristem structure and causes changes in the apex geometry and activity. However, the mechanisms governing the repetitive apex divisions are hardly known. Here, an overview of dichotomous branching is presented, occurring in structurally different apices of phylogenetically distant plants, and in various organs (e. g. shoots, roots, <b>rhizophores).</b> Additionally, morphogenetic effects of dichotomy are reviewed, including its impact on organogenesis and mechanical constraints. At the end, the hormonal and genetic regulation of the dichotomous branching is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Selaginella P. Beauv. is {{the only}} genus in the family Selaginellaceae Willk. The genus is monophyletic, has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, contains about 750 species and can be characterized {{by the presence of}} <b>rhizophores,</b> leaves, a ligule, heterospory and adaxial, reniform sporangia. Twenty species were found in the study area: Selaginella alstonii, S. contigua, S. convoluta, S. decomposita, S. erectifolia, S. erythropus, S. flexuosa, S. jungermannioides, S. macrostachya, S. marginata, S. microphylla, S. muscosa, S. producta, S. sellowii, S. sematophylla, S. suavis, S. sulcata, S. tenella, S. tenuissima and S. vestiens. Two new species records for the state are presented (S. jungermannioides and S. tenella). We present descriptions of the genus and species, an identification key, the synonyms pertaining to Brazil, illustrations, and comments about the taxonomy and distribution of species in Brazil...|$|R
50|$|While {{scientists}} have already {{concluded that the}} life cycle span of S. apoda is reliant {{in large part on}} the temperature of its habitat, researchers suggest that the duration of daylight may {{play a key role in}} determining the duration of the S. apoda life cycle as well. The primary root system of S. apoda is fragile. The root hairs are able to live on the roots for months and are mature on the roots prior to the root system penetrating the soil in the early growth stages. The roots, angle meristems, as well as <b>rhizophores</b> of S. apoda experience supplemental growth as the plant itself increases in height. This additional growth occurs in order to ensure the species does not have to transfer water in abundance while still being able to grow across a vast surface plane.|$|R
5000|$|Stigmaria {{is a form}} taxon {{for common}} fossils found in Carboniferous rocks. They {{represent}} the underground rooting structures of coal forest lycopsid trees such as Sigillaria and Lepidodendron. These swamp forest trees grew to 50 meters and were anchored by an extensive network of branching underground structures with [...] "rootlets" [...] attached to them. Analysis of the morphology and anatomy of these stigmarian systems suggests they were shoot-like {{and so they are}} called rhizomes or <b>rhizophores.</b> The stigmarian rhizomes are typically covered with a spiral pattern of circular scars where [...] "rootlets" [...] were attached. Since the stigmarian systems are shoot-like, these [...] "rootlets" [...] may be modified leaves, adapted to serve the function of roots. However, some paleontologists argue that the [...] "rootlets" [...] were true roots, with a complex branching structure and root hairs, comparable to the roots of the closest living relative of Lepidodendron, the quillworts (genus Isoetes).|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{as a first step}} in exploiting endophytic bacteria to improve yam production. Little information is available on population densities and genetic diversity of endophytic bacteria in yam cultivated in tropical regions. This study demonstrated that higher densities of total endophytic bacteria and Bacillus occur in the interior of roots and decrease as the sampled plant organ departs from soil. Bacillus represents approximately 1 % of the total bacterial endophytic population. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analyses performed with 88 randomly-selected Bacillus isolates resulted in 28 groups, and sequence analyses of the 16 S region of the ribosomal DNA of 24 isolates representing all major RAPD groups revealed that they could be clustered in 2 clades: Bacillus cereus and B. pumilus. While B. cereus was able to colonize the entire plant, B. pumilus remained confined to the <b>rhizophores.</b> Further research should concentrate on the application of these isolates in biotechnological processes, such as biocontrol and yam growth promotion...|$|R
40|$|Rhizophora mangle L., one of {{the most}} common {{mangrove}} species, has an aerial structure system that gives it stability in permanently swampy soils. In fact, these structures, known as "aerial roots" or "stilt roots", have proven to be peculiar branches with positive geotropism, which form a large number of roots when in contact with swampy soils. These organs have a sympodial branching system, wide pith, slightly thickened cortex, collateral vascular bundles, polyarch stele and endarch protoxylem, as in the stem, and a periderm produced by a phellogen at the apex similar to a root cap. They also have the same type of trichosclereid that occurs in the stem, with negative geotropism, unlike true Rhizophora roots, which do not form trichosclereids at all. On the other hand, these branches do not form leaves and in this respect they are similar to roots. These peculiar branches are <b>rhizophores</b> or special root-bearing branches, analogous to those found in Lepidodendrales and other Carboniferous tree ferns that grew in swampy soils...|$|R
40|$|Peptide signals mediate {{a variety}} of cell-to-cell {{communication}} crucial for plant growth and development. During Arabidopsis thaliana vascular development, a CLE (CLAVATA 3 /EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION-related) family peptide hormone, TDIF (tracheary element differentiation inhibitory factor), regulates procambial cell fate by its inhibitory activity on xylem differentiation. To address if this activity is conserved among vascular plants, we performed comparative analyses of TDIF signaling in non-flowering vascular plants (gymnosperms, monilophytes and lycophytes). We identified orthologs of TDIF/CLE {{as well as its}} receptor TDR/PXY (TDIF RECEPTOR/PHLOEM INTERCALATED WITH XYLEM) in Ginkgo biloba, Adiantum aethiopicum and Selaginella kraussiana by RACE-PCR. The predicted TDIF peptide sequences in seed plants and monilophytes were identical to that of A. thaliana TDIF. We examined the effects of exogenous CLE peptide-motif sequences of TDIF in these species. We found that liquid culturing of dissected leaves or shoots was useful for examining TDIF activity during vascular development. TDIF treatment suppressed xylem/tracheary element differentiation of procambial cells in G. bioloba and A. aethiopicum leaves. In contrast, neither TDIF nor putative endogenous TDIF inhibited xylem differentiation in developing shoots and <b>rhizophores</b> of S. kraussiana. These data suggest that activity of TDIF in vascular development is conserved among extant euphyllophytes. In addition to the conserved function, via liquid culturing of its bulbils, we found a novel inhibitory activity on root growth in the monilophyte Asplenium x lucrosum suggesting lineage-specific co-option of peptide signaling occurred during the evolution of vascular plant organs...|$|R
60|$|About sunset {{we hit the}} Ebumesu, or 'Winding Water.' The people {{declare that}} it had a single mouth till the {{earthquakes}} of July 1862, which shook down Accra, raised a divide, and made a double embouchure. The eastern fork, known as the Páná, is the drain of a large and branchy lagoon, brackish water, bitumen-coloured or brassy-yellow, with poisonous vegetation, and bounded by mangroves abounding in tannin. These water-forests grow differently from the red and white <b>rhizophores</b> of Eastern Africa. We shall again be ferried over {{the upper part of the}} western mouth. Both have bad bars, especially the latter. I therefore can by no means agree with Mr. Walker's report:--'The western outlet of the Ebumesu, near the village of Eku Enu, or Ekwanu, is quite practicable for ordinary surf-boats during the dry season--say half the year--and even in the middle of June I found the bar smooth and safe. Having for thirty years worked some of the worst bars and beaches' (the Gaboon? or the Sherbro?) 'along some hundreds of miles of the West Coast, I am able to state that the Ebumesu bar might be safely utilised for landing goods and machinery; but during the heavy surf of the rainy season goods could always be disembarked at Axim, and, if necessary, carried along the beach to the mouth of the Ebumesu, and thence by boat to the tramway from that river to the mine.' This last statement is quite correct.|$|R
40|$|The high fructan {{contents}} in underground {{organs of}} Cerrado species, high water solubility and fast metabolism of these compounds highlight {{their role as}} carbon storage and as an adaptive feature in plants under drought. In this study, we showed that anatomical structure, in association with soluble compounds and metabolism of inulin-type fructans were modified in <b>rhizophores</b> of Crysolaena obovata submitted to water suppression and recovery after re-watering. Plants were subjected to daily watering (control), suppression of watering for 22 days (water suppression) and suppression of watering followed by re-watering after 10 days (re-watered). Plants were collected at time 0 and after 3, 7, 10, 12, 17 and 22 days of treatment. In addition to changes in fructan metabolism, high proline content was detected in drought stressed plants, contributing to osmoregulation and recovery after water status reestablishment. Under water suppression, total inulin was reduced from approx. 60 to 40 %, mainly due to exohydrolase activity. Concurrently, the activity of fructosyltransferases promoted the production of short chain inulin, which could contribute {{to the increase in}} osmotic potential. After re-watering, most parameters analyzed were similar to those of control plants, indicating the resumption of regular metabolism, after water absorption. Inulin sphero-crystals accumulated in parenchymatic cells of the cortex, vascular tissues and pith were reduced under drought and accompanied anatomical changes, starting from day 10. At 22 days of drought, the cortical and vascular tissues were collapsed, and inulin sphero-crystals and inulin content were reduced. The localization of inulin sphero-crystals in vascular tissues of C. obovata, as well as the decrease of total inulin and the increase in oligo: polysaccharide ratio in water stressed plants is consistent with the role of fructans in protecting plants against drought...|$|R
