50|$|The {{game is a}} {{top-down}} 2D (with optional (incomplete) 3D mode) {{construction and}} management simulation where the player takes control of building and running a prison. The player is responsible for managing various aspects of their prison including building cells and facilities, planning and connecting utilities, hiring and assigning staff, including a warden, guards, workers, and more. The player needs to <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> unlock more aspects of the game. The player is also responsible for the finance, and keeping their inmates content. The player's role is of both architect and governor with sandbox micromanagement themes such as choosing where to put lights, drains and how they connect together. The player is also able to add workshops to the prison as well as reform programs that reduce the specific prisoner's repeat-offender rate. The player tells the prisoners what to do indirectly by setting their schedule. The game takes inspiration from Theme Hospital, Dungeon Keeper, and Dwarf Fortress. The player can also allow temperature, gangs, and more to add extra difficulty.|$|E

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Undertaking {{training}} {{in rural areas}} is a recognised way of helping <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> work in rural communities. Postgraduate year two medical doctors in New Zealand {{have been able to}} undertake a three-month placement in rural practice as part of their pre-vocational training experience since November 2010. AIM: To describe the experience of a rural general practice team providing training to a postgraduate year two medical trainee, and to describe the teaching experience and range of conditions seen by the trainee. METHODS: A pre- and post-placement interview with staff, and analysis of a logbook of cases and teaching undertaken in the practice. RESULTS: The practice team's experience of having the trainee was positive, and the trainee was exposed {{to a wide range of}} conditions over 418 clinical encounters. The trainee received 22. 5 hours of formal training over the three-month placement. DISCUSSION: Rural general practice can provide a wide range of clinical experience to a postgraduate year two medical trainee. Rural practices in New Zealand should be encouraged to offer teaching placements at this training level. Exposure to rural practice at every level of training is important to encourage doctors to consider rural practice as a career...|$|E

50|$|The agency {{initially}} struggled <b>to</b> <b>recruit</b> <b>staff</b> due <b>to</b> {{its location}} in Warsaw, which offered lower pay {{than some other}} cities, and the unclear agency mandate.

The dependency of the organisation on staff secondments has been identified by external auditors as a risk, since valuable experience may be lost when such staff leave the organisation and return to their permanent jobs.|$|R
40|$|During the Benin presidential {{election}} of March 2011, a new communication tool (Internet) {{was added to}} the traditional tools of electoral campaign: meetings, electoral promotion gimmicks, political songs, broadcast and print media, and posters. Indeed, the three main candidates to the {{presidential election}}s integrated Internet in their comprehensive strategy, <b>recruiting</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> take care of a Website, several user profiles on famous social networks. Meanwhile, the Internet is used by only 2. 2 % of the population. This chapter analyzes the Websites of the three candidates, paying particular attention to graphic design, uploaded available information, frequency of updating, and interaction with the audience. It also scrutinizes the use of various profiles on social networks. The chapter then interrogates why there was such an important investment on the Internet during this campaign, whereas data show that very few potential voters are actually connected to the Internet in Benin. This chapter identifies the role of Internet campaigning and the place that the Internet has taken in the electoral communication strategies, and tries to understand the real purpose behind this use.

40|$|Focusing on the {{function}} {{and role of}} educational support services {{in the light of}} continuing technological development, this paper discusses the changing relationships between managerial and task performance levels in tertiary educational organisations. Specific reference is made to the impact of computer technologies and the demands of the user. Twenty years ago when we began to introduce computer technology to perform the task level work required to manage access, storage and delivery of information in tertiary institutions, the administrative grouping of educational support services was clearly defined by function (ref. note 1). Each support unit, (the library, print shop, media production and delivery, educational development) <b>recruited</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> operate machines and perform tasks unique to the form of each function. Managers of each unit were recruited from a background of experience and knowledge and demonstrated expertise in both the task and management levels of these functions. The introduction of mainframe computer services did not radically upset the status quo. A suitably qualified person to head the computer centre was recruited from a background in programming (task level), systems analysis and engineering. In most cases the unit reported to the director o...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{attempts to}} answer the demands from previous literature to extend the use of systematic preference testing, and to enable people to make choices by enhancing the modes of communication of preference. It looks at the viability of systematic preference testing, embedded observations of preference, {{and the use of}} <b>staff</b> opinion <b>to</b> predict the person preference of people with a profound learning disability and high support needs. The data collected from 17 adults with a profound learning disability and high support needs was analysed using the city block metric to permit informal statements about the trends within the data. More formal statistical testing was invalid due to difficulties during the data collection phase. The results suggest that the use of systematic preference testing without previous training has limited application within this population. There is a tentative suggestion that embedded preference observations may be more widely accessible for this population. However, there is not a measurement of embedded observations validity within this study. Also, the accuracy of staff opinion of preference seemed to depend on the relationship between the participant and the staff member. Caution is advised in generalising {{the results of this study}} due to the difficulties in <b>recruiting</b> <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> be involved.

500|$|Treloar {{experienced}} difficulties {{managing the}} Memorial and its {{staff in the}} years after World War II. While the AWM had few difficulties <b>recruiting</b> <b>staff,</b> it struggled <b>to</b> retain them due to housing shortages in Canberra {{and the way in which}} the Memorial was run. Treloar's working style contributed to these problems; although he was personally friendly and took an interest in the wellbeing of his employees, he did not delegate tasks and it was difficult for AWM <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> meet with him in person to discuss their responsibilities. This made it difficult for <b>staff</b> <b>to</b> complete urgent tasks, and contributed to delays in key projects such as the construction of the Memorial's Hall of Memory. Tom Hungerford, who worked for the AWM between 1948 and 1949, wrote in his memoirs that Treloar was [...] "most dedicated, most incredibly hard-working, most unfailingly kind and most ineffectual". Treloar increasingly obsessed over relatively minor details and gained a reputation for indecisiveness.|$|R
