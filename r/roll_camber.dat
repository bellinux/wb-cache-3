40|$|Abstract—The {{roll center}} {{is one of}} the key {{parameters}} for designing a suspension. Several driving characteristics are affected significantly by the migration of the roll center during the suspension’s motion. The strut/SLA (strut/short-long-arm) suspension, which is widely used in production cars, combines the space-saving characteristics of a MacPherson strut suspension with some of the preferred handling characteristics of an SLA suspension. In this study, a front strut/SLA suspension is modeled by ADAMS/Car software. Kinematic roll analysis is then employed to investigate how the rolling characteristics change under the wheel travel and steering input. The related parameters, including the roll center height, <b>roll</b> <b>camber</b> gain, toe change, scrub radius and wheel track width change, are analyzed and discussed. It is found that the strut/SLA suspension clearly has a higher roll center than strut and SLA suspensions do. The variations in the roll center height under roll analysis are very different as the wheel travel displacement and steering angle are added. The results of the <b>roll</b> <b>camber</b> gain, scrub radius and wheel track width change are considered satisfactory. However, the toe change is too large and needs fine-tuning through a sensitivity analysis. Keywords—roll analysis, roll center height, steering, strut/SLA suspension, wheel travel I...|$|E

Till today, such a machine has not been built due to the expected size, mass and cost. A novel design, called "Riesenrad" ion gantry, promises to provide a competitive solution. The {{central part of the}} Riesenrad, which can rotate ± 90 °, is supported (statically determinate) on pendular bearing units with two rollers each. High precision requirements for the structure rule out any plastic deformations in the area of contact. The present report describes the design of the highly-loaded rollers. In order to achieve a large contact area and a uniform distribution of contact stresses, a "barrel shape" for the rollers is proposed. An analysis using the finite element method (FEM) was performed to optimise the roller design, namely to establish the required crown <b>roll</b> (<b>camber</b> radius) ...|$|E

40|$|The tyre {{lateral force}} is a {{function}} of side slip and camber. While the lateral force due to side slip is {{the main part of the}} total cornering force, it saturates at a certain level of side slip angle even when the available tyre-road friction has not been fully utilised. In such a situation, the use of an appropriate extra camber could increase the safety, stability, and manoeuvrability of the car. This research serves as a further step to put the theory of variable caster steering into eect. The key idea of the theory is actively varying the caster to produce the required extra camber in a good fashion. In this investigation, the theory was examined in a specic case: developing a variable caster scheme to counteract <b>roll</b> <b>camber</b> - a phenomenon that generally limits the tyre lateral force and hence the maximum lateral acceleration of the car. By applying the variable caster scheme, the lateral force is increased. Therefore, the lateral grip capacity of the car is expanded. The benet of the variable caster was also further exploited to improve the steering returnability during low speed cornering. The theory of variable caster steering began with the development of road steering wheel kinematics. In order to do that, a number of coordinate systems was introduced to suciently describe the steering motion of a road steering wheel. The homogeneous transformation was then utilised to map coordinates between the systems. By doing so, the kinematics was developed. It was then used in two ways. The rst was to determine the camber, which is the orientation of the wheel, as a function of steering axis orientation, vehicle motion, suspension geometry, and steering angle, for a cornering car. The other was for developing a novel method to determine kingpin moment which aects the returnability of the steering wheels during low speed cornering. Then a rollable vehicle model, which is capable of capturing important characteristics of a turning car such as load transfer and roll motion, was constructed. The Magic Formula was used for tyre force modelling to take the camber contribution and the non-linear characteristics of the tyre into account. MATLAB/Simulink was used to simulate the dynamic response of the vehicle to steering input. The steering wheel kinematics and the dynamics model of the car were later validated using both multi-body and experimental data. More specically, the validation of the wheel kinematics was done by a road steering wheel model built in ADAMS software; the dynamic vehicle model was validated using data from eld tests and from a full car model constructed in the CarSim environment. A kinematics analysis of the camber function determined earlier was carried out. On the basis of the analysis, a scheme of varying the caster with the primary aim of countering the <b>roll</b> <b>camber</b> was proposed. The dynamic responses of the vehicle to dierent steering inputs were examined to evaluate its dynamic performance with and without the variable caster strategy. The simulation results show that the <b>roll</b> <b>camber</b> phenomenon, for the caster-controlled car, is reduced signicantly. The associated lateral acceleration and yaw rate increase without compromising other handling characteristics. The variable caster strategy, therefore, provides a more manoeuvrable car with expanded turning capacity compared to the passive car. To take advantage of the variable caster, a caster conguration that can improve the returnability of the steering wheels in low speed cornering manoeuvres was also suggested. Using the novel method for determining the kingpin moment, we showed that the caster conguration provides a better steering returnability during low speed cornering...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve {{predictable}} handling of a race car, local mounts connecting suspension components to the chassis should be sufficiently rigid to minimize unwanted local deflection which may adversely affect suspension geometry. In this work, the effects of local chassis flexibility of the spring perch on <b>roll</b> stiffness, tire <b>camber</b> change, and steer angle change are determined from a finite element model (FEM) of a Winston Cup race car. Details such as side gussets, supporting brackets, and local curvature of the frame rail spring pocket are included in a shell model of the spring perch. The local shell model of the spring perch is integrated with the global finite element stiffness model of the chassis and suspension consisting of an assembly of beam and shell elements.

40|$|This {{article was}} {{published}} in the journal, Vehicle System Dynamics [© Taylor & Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] data show that 35 % of fatal crashes in sport utility vehicles included vehicle rollover. At the same time, experimental testing to improve safety is expensive and dangerous. Therefore, multi-body simulation is used in this research to improve the understanding of rollover dynamics. The majority of previous work uses low-fidelity models. Here, a complex and highly nonlinear multi-body model with 165 degrees of freedom is correlated to vehicle kinematic and compliance (K&C) measurements. The Magic Formula tyre model is employed. Design of experiment methodology is used to identify tyre properties affecting vehicle rollover. A novel, statistical approach is used to link suspension K&C characteristics with rollover propensity. Research so far reveals that the tyre properties that have the greatest influence on vehicle rollover are friction coefficient, friction variation with load, camber stiffness and tyre vertical stiffness. Key K&C characteristics affecting rollover propensity are front and rear suspension rate, front <b>roll</b> stiffness, front <b>camber</b> gain, front and rear camber compliance and rear jacking force. © 2014 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{handling}} is an {{area where}} vehicle manufacturers constantly seek improvement. However it has been traditionally regarded as an area where improvement is seen to come at the cost of vehicle ride quality. Even though much work has been done in this area, {{only a limited number of}} studies have considered decoupling the body roll effects on wheel camber change, thus improving roadholding capabilities. Whilst several of the adaptive or active suspension systems, control damping effects to improve ride, vehicle manufacturers also now use electronic systems to improve vehicle stability and handling characteristics. Some of these may even include suspension systems that maintain or adapt wheel camber. Although current examples ofsuch suspension systems aim to either reduce body <b>roll</b> or <b>camber</b> change, they cannot meet both conditions simultaneously during independent wheel travel. ill order to understand the true benefits of camber control, a suspension system that can have such camber control activated and deactivated, should be considered for comparative purposes. Such study would be quite expensive and a time consuming challenge if it were to be done in the real world, especially if the benefits and feasibility are not yet clear today to help justify any funding requirements. For this reason a suspension concept is proposed, investigated through computer modelling techniques and is outlined In this report. The concept consists ofhaving the upper control arm of a suspension system adapt its length, with the use of intelligent. hydraulically actuated control systems, thus maintaining the set wheel camber angle, during independent wheel travel. A. literature survey has been conducted, investigating previous work that has been. carried out in this area of research. An initial study has also been conducted in the available technologies relating to the proposed concept. Computer modelling techniques have also been acquired and implemented by the author, to produce a fully functional virtual prototype of a vehicle, using a selected multibody systems (MBS) program. However, MBS tools often do not include the means to define and solve complex hydraulic and control system effects. Therefore investigations into the best approach. of solving integrated MBS models with complex system models were required and developed. Several simulations, including step-steer, sme, swept-sine and ISO-lane change manoeuvres have been run and validated on a benchmarked vehicle. These were later compared to results of simulations with the proposed concept implemented on a modified vehicle model. The unique approach developed to solve the combined MBS and complex hydraulic and control systems, has proven significant benefits for vehicle dynamics analysis, whilst the above mentioned concept of maintaining camber angle has proved to be quite feasible with some benefit to vehicle handling.

40|$|The final {{quality of}} steel strip is {{significantly}} {{affected by the}} first forming operations. Strip defects caused {{at this early stage}} are difficult or even impossible to remove in downstream lines, and may lead to a reduction of output figures {{as a result of their}} interference with forming and other subsequent processes. This work examined the formation of the so-called camber - the curvature of the strip in the strip plane - during the roughing process, which represents the first forming process in flat steel production. Inextricably linked with the camber phenomenon is the formation of an asymmetrical thickness profile (thickness wedge). The purpose of this work was to gain knowledge about the optimization potential of the roughing process in order to obtain a strip geometry with a maximum freedom from camber and thickness wedge formation. A great number of effects on camber formation is already known and has been described in the relevant literature. What has so far not been examined in detail is the edging effect frequently observed in the industrial practice. For that reason, initial laboratory tests were conducted to determine possible camber-affecting criteria in connection with the edging process. Three particular factors could be identified: different diameters of edging rolls, off-centre position of specimens and oblique head and tail ends of the strip resulted in a camber formation as early as during the edging process or after the subsequent horizontal rolling pass. Varying roughness values of edging rolls did not produce any camber. The main purpose of further tests was to examine the regeneration of a straight form without any camber and thickness wedge. To begin with, wedge-free specimens were <b>rolled</b> to a <b>camber</b> shape with tilted rolls. A restoration of the specimen's original straight shape was attempted a) by tilting the rolls in the opposite direction, b) by an only minor tilting of rolls and c) by their adjustment to a straight position. Test results proved that the straight, non-camber and wedge-free shape could be restored after the third rolling pass with only slightly tilted rolls. In addition to straight initial specimens rolled with tilted rolls, specimens with thickness wedges were rolled with straight <b>rolls.</b> The significant <b>camber</b> formation as a result of the asymmetrical thickness profile may be prevented by tilting the rolls according to the initial thickness wedge. This roll adjustment, however, does not cause a reduction of the thickness wedge. The rolled product exhibits either a camber or a thickness wedge or both defects. To obtain a straight specimen, an additional control element besides the tilting of rolls is required. For this reason, tests were conducted by using side guides. The positive effect of side guides on the strip form is frequently observed in the industrial practice. A comparison of specimens rolled with and without side guides proved that a reduction of both camber and thickness wedge can be achieved by using side guides during the rolling process. The thickness wedge was in part equalized as a result of an asymmetrical spread at both sides of the stand. In addition to laboratory tests, industrial process data were evaluated and analyzed by using data recorded by a strip form measuring system installed at the roughing train of the EKO-Stahl hot-rolling mill. This system measures the position of strip edges at both sides of the stand and at two points each in the entry and exit area of the stand. These data were used to determine the curvature of the strip, which provides a precise information about the size and direction of the strip camber. This calculation allows an online conclusion as to the strip camber at any point along the strip length. The curvature and all other relevant process data of EKO-Stahl were collected in a data base and were analyzed with regard to the strip camber, with various data-based methods being used to determine and evaluate the influential factors of the strip camber. This evaluation and the relevant test results were used to select the input variables of a data-based modelling for a pre-calculation of the strip curvature by means of the neural network technique. The obtained correlation factors between the curvature data determined on the basis of measured edge position data and those calculated by means of the model amount to 0. 7 - 0. 8 in the validation. In conclusion, a procedure for preventing camber and thickness wedge formation during hot roughing was elaborated and submitted to the German Patent Office. This procedure could allow the production of a straight form free from camber and thickness wedge formation for straight slabs as well as for slabs with a thickness wedge. A proposal for the control of the roughing process on the basis of this procedure is included...|$|R
