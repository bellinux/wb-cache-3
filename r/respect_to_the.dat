5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> point where the front wheel contacts the ground, bikes can either skid the front wheel or flip the bike and rider over the front wheel. A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition, {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move backwards in a looping motion with <b>respect</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak luminosity {{in the middle of}} this motion.|$|E

5|$|Earth overtakes Jupiter every 398.9 days as it orbits the Sun, a {{duration}} {{called the}} synodic period.

5|$|Ecliptic {{coordinates}} are {{convenient for}} specifying positions of Solar System objects, {{as most of}} the planets' orbits have small inclinations to the ecliptic, and therefore always appear relatively close to it on the sky.
