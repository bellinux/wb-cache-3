MethodsAll patients terminated from the practice between January 2008 and December 2012 were identified. Charts were reviewed <b>for</b> demographic information, <b>termination</b> <b>reason,</b> and cancer diagnosis. ResultsIn the five year study period, 8851 new patients presented to the division of gynecologic oncology. Within this cohort, 123 patient-physician relationships were terminated. Among terminated patients, missed appointments (63. 4 %), noncompliance to treatment (23. 6 %), disruptive behavior (10. 6 %), and drug abuse behavior (2. 4 %) were the key <b>reasons</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination.</b> While no patients were terminated <b>for</b> financial <b>reason,</b> statistical differences were found for those with Medicaid insurance (OR= 5; 95 % CI: 3. 4 – 7. 1).

5000|$|Without {{explicitly}} {{referring to}} homosexuality, {{the executive order}} responded to several years of charges {{that the presence of}} homosexual employees in the State Department posed blackmail risks. Attorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. explained that the new order was designed to encompass both loyalty and security risks and he differentiated between the two: [...] "Employees could be a security risk and still not be disloyal or have any traitorous thoughts, but it may be that their personal habits are such that they might be subject to blackmail by people who seek to destroy the safety of our country." [...] The executive order had the effect of banning gay men and lesbians from working for any agency of the federal government. It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the United States Civil Service Commission announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.|$|E
50|$|However, {{because the}} {{psychiatric}} community regarded homosexuality as {{a mental illness}} during the 1950s, gay people were considered susceptible to blackmail, thus constituting a security risk. U.S. government officials assumed that communists would blackmail gay employees {{of the federal government}} who would provide them classified information rather than risk exposure. In 1950, the same year that Senator Joseph McCarthy claimed 205 communists were working in the State Department, Undersecretary of State John Peurifoy said that the State Department had allowed 91 gays to resign. McCarthy hired Roy Cohn — who some allege was a closeted gay man — as chief counsel of his Congressional subcommittee, which among other things investigated homosexuality in government employees. Together, McCarthy and Cohn were responsible for the firing of scores of gay men from government employment, and strong-armed many opponents into silence using rumors of their homosexuality. On April 27, 1953, President Eisenhower issued Executive Order 10450, which banned gay men and lesbians from working for any agency of the federal government. It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person's sexual orientation alone could not be the sole <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>termination</b> from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the United States Civil Service Commission announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.
