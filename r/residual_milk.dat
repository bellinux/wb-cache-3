40|$|Milk from {{dairy cows}} is a staple dietary {{component}} for humans {{all over the}} world. Regardless of whether milk is consumed in its purest, unaltered form or as high-end products such as fine cheese or ice cream, {{it needs to be}} of high quality when taken from the cow, produced at a low price and produced in a system that consider aspects such as animal health, animal welfare and sustainability. This thesis investigated the role of milk removal and the importance of <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> on milk yield, milk composition and milking efficiency in dairy cows. The specific aspects examined were whether <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> retained in the udder, specifically its fat component, is involved in regulation of milk synthesis and secretion and whether removal of this <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> influences milk yield, composition and quality, measured as milk fatty acid composition and free fatty acid content. The results showed that milking efficiency could be increased by increasing the pulsation ratio or using a higher cluster or teat cup take-off threshold, without negative effects on milk yield or milk composition. Milking time in automatic milking systems could thereby be decreased by one minute per cow and milking or more. Milk fatty acid composition was affected by several treatments tested, but the content of free fatty acids and the size distribution of milk fat globules were unaffected. <b>Residual</b> <b>milk</b> yield increased both due to repeated <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> removal and to use of a higher cluster take-off level. <b>Residual</b> <b>milk</b> removal also increased the relative proportion of short-chain fatty acids in milk. The overall conclusion of this thesis is that <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> removal in mid-lactation dairy cows does not affect milk yield and that milking efficiency in an automatic milking system can be increased with higher takeoff levels without affecting milk yield or composition. No evidence of a regulatory mechanism in <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> was found, but <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> removal increased milk fat synthesis...|$|E

40|$|Very {{little is}} known about the udder characteristics, {{partitioning}} of milk in the mammary gland and efficiency of machine milking in donkeys. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of the udder and teats, milk yield in relation to pulsation rates (90, 120 and 150 cycles/min), milk partitioning in the mammary gland, composition of the spontaneously removed and <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> fractions and milking efficiency. Forty-one healthy Martina Franca jennies in the third month of lactation and routinely milked twice daily were used in three studies. Udder characteristics were evaluated by direct measurements and ultrasonographic scanning. <b>Residual</b> <b>milk</b> was obtained by milking after an oxytocin administration (40 IU i. m.). The prevalent shapes were 'bowl' for udders and 'conical' for teats.

The internal structures of the udder resulted as several pockets of ducts empting directly into the teat. The pulsation rate of 120 cycles/min improved (P< 0 · 05) the milk yield in comparison to the 90 and 150 cycles/min, reduced the <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> fraction, thus improved (P< 0 · 05) milking efficiency. <b>Residual</b> <b>milk</b> composition had higher (P< 0 · 05) fat content and somatic cell count than the spontaneously removed milk fraction.

40|$|A {{previous}} study showed the additive methane (CH 4) -mitigating effect of nitrate and linseed fed to non-lactating cows. Before practical application, {{the use of}} this new strategy in dairy cows requires further investigation in terms of persistency of methanogenesis reduction and absence of <b>residuals</b> in <b>milk</b> products. The objective of this experiment was to study the long-term effect of linseed plus nitrate on enteric CH 4 emission and performance in dairy cows. We also assessed the effect of this feeding strategy on the presence of nitrate <b>residuals</b> in <b>milk</b> products, total tract digestibility, nitrogen (N) balance and rumen fermentation. A total of 16 lactating Holstein cows were allocated to two groups in a randomised design conducted in parallel for 17 weeks. Diets were on a dry matter (DM) basis: (1) control (54 % maize silage, 6 % hay and 40 % concentrate; CON) or (2) control plus 3. 5 % added fat from linseed and 1. 8 % nitrate (LIN + NIT). Diets were equivalent in terms of CP (16 %), starch (28 %) and NDF (33 %), and were offered twice daily. Cows were fed ad libitum, except during weeks 5, 16 and 17 in which feed was restricted to 95 % of dry matter intake (DMI) to ensure complete consumption of meals during measurement periods. Milk production and DMI were measured weekly. Nitrate and nitrite concentrations in milk and milk products were determined monthly. Daily CH 4 emission was quanti fi ed in open circuit respiration chambers (weeks 5 and 16). Total tract apparent digestibility, N balance and rumen fermentation parameters were determined in week 17. Daily DMI tended to be lower with LIN + NIT from week 4 to 16 (− 5. 1 kg/day on average). The LIN + NIT diet decreased milk production during 6 non-consecutive weeks (− 2. 5 kg/day on average). Nitrate or nitrite residuals were not detected in milk and associated products. The LIN + NIT diet reduced CH 4 emission to a similar extent {{at the beginning and end}} of the trial (− 47 %, g/day; − 30 %, g/kg DMI; − 33 %, g/kg fat- and protein-corrected milk, on average). Diets did not affect N ef fi ciency and nutrients digestibility. In the rumen, LIN + NIT did not affect protozoa number but reduced total volatile fatty acid (− 12 %) and propionate (− 31 %) concentrations. We concluded that linseed plus nitrate may have a long-term CH 4 -mitigating effect in dairy cows and that consuming milk products from cows fed nitrate may be safe in terms of nitrate and nitrite residuals.

Responsiveness to milking was monitored during the first machine milking, on d 2 of lactation, and during milkings on d 4 and 130 of lactation. Measurements included kicking and stepping behavior, plasma cortisol and plasma oxytocin, heart rate, milk yield, milking time, milk flow rate, and <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> obtained after administration of exogenous oxytocin. With repeated early lactation milkings, <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> and the incidence of abnormal milk flow curves decreased. On d 130 of lactation all heifers exhibited normal milk ejection. Except for higher plasma cortisol concentrations on d 2, all measures were consistent over time between d 2 and 4 of lactation as indicated by significant rank correlations.

In addition, 270 dairy farms that had reported cases of animals with poor milkability were contacted for an interview to classify the disorders. Farmers suspected disturbed milk ejection in 52 %, anatomical dysfunction of the teat and/or the udder in 16 % and milk ejection disorder or impaired milkability caused by discernable environmental factors in 32 % of the cases. Forty-eight animals from 18 farms with suspected milk ejection disorders were selected for an experimental field study which included milk flow recording and OT administration to induce milk ejection. After cessation of the spontaneous milk flow, a low dose of OT (0 · 2, 0 · 5 or 1 i. u.) was injected i. v. to test the responsiveness of the udder to OT at a physiological level. When milk flow ceased again, 10 i. u. OT was injected i. v.

40|$|The {{quantity}} of milk accumulated in the udder, under extended milking intervals, could reduce <b>milk</b> yield, with <b>residual</b> effects on following milking intervals. Aim {{of the trial}} was to modify the {{quantity of}} milk stored in the udder over one milking interval, by decreasing udder emptying (100, 70, 40, and 0 %), in order to describe the short-term effects on milk yield and composition. 16 dairy cows averaging 41 kg/d of milk were assigned to treatments 100, 70, 40, and 0 % according to a Latin square design with four 7 -d periods. Cows were milked twice daily at 0700 and 1730. Treatments were applied at the morning milking called MO. Changes in milk yield and composition were assessed on the 7 following milking (Ml to M 7), using the mixed procedure of SAS with milking as repeated measures. The quantity of milk collected at Ml milking linearly increased as udder emptying decreased at MO. Nevertheless, because of milk accumulation in the udder, MO+Ml milk yield was quadratically depressed by - 1. 5, - 5. 3, - 12. 9 kg with 70, 40 and 0 % treatments, respectively. <b>Residual</b> effects on <b>milk</b> yield were only observed for 40 and 0 % treatments on M 2 and M 3 milking and did not differ between 40 and 0 % treatments.

This will depend partially on the length of time between morning and evening milkings, for the difference in yield and fat percentage is reduced as the time intervals approach equal length. There is left in the udder after a normal milking an appreciable quantity of milk of high fat percentage which has been termed "residual milk".

A total of 32 Friesian cows, sixteen high breeding index (HBI) and sixteen low breeding index (LBI) (2 - 11 years old) were used in the study. Within each breeding index group, cows were further divided into 2 groups, cows were then allocated to either once daily milking (treatment group) or twice daily milking (control group) so the groups were balanced for breeding index and age. The experimental period was divided into 3 main periods, a pre-treatment (3 weeks), a treatment (3 weeks) and a post-treatment period (7 weeks). During the pre-treatment period IMP (before morning and afternoon milking), empty udder volume after morning milking, <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> and peak flow rate were measured. During the treatment period intramammary pressure was measured at 15 hr, 20 hr and 24 hr after milking. During the first three days of the post-treatment period IMP was measured before afternoon milking and udder volume after afternoon milking were measured. Milk yield and composition were measured during the whole period. 1) On average once daily milking reduced daily yields of milk, fat, and protein by 2. 8 kg/cow (19 %), 0. 08 kg/cow (14 %) and 0. 08 kg/cow (16 %) respectively in comparison with the control group. 2) Following cessation of the treatment, the average daily production of cows previously milked once daily was 1. 1 kg (7 %) milk, 0. 06 kg (9 %) fat, 0. 02 kg (4) lactose less than that of the control group. 3) The decrease in milk yield for the individual covs over the treatment period ranged from 12 % to 46 %. 4) The concentration of fat and protein increased while that of lactose decreased during the treatment period in cows milked once daily. 5) Measurement of the milk yield and milking times were not sufficiently precise to allow the calculations of <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> by a novel method. 6) There was a significant relationship between IMP 15 hr after previous milking (P < 0. 05) and the decrease in milk yield due to once daily milking. 7) The response to once daily milking was not related to other factors such as IMP at 20 hr and 24 hr after milking, udder volume or milk flow.

In both experiments the cows were paired by parity, stage of lactation and productivity, and they were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the treatments: massage or no massage of the udder at the end of milking, in two periods in a crossover design. The individual milk production of each cow was measured. <b>Residual</b> <b>milk</b> was collected and measured 2 min after an oxitocin application. California Mastitis Test was used to detect the occurrence (experiment 1 p > 0. 41, n = 10 and experiment 2 p > 0. 46, n = 12), on RM (experiment 1, 1. 78 ± 0. 45 kg, n = 10; experiment 2, 2. 42 ± 0. 32 kg, n = 12), or on mastitis incidence (experiment 2, chi-square; DF = 1; p > 0. 68, n = 26). We conclude that udder massage at the end of milking has no effect on RM and does not affect mastitis incidence, at least under the conditions used in these experiments...|$|E
40|$|Neste estudo, foi testada a hipótese de que o medo de seres humanos é duradouro e pode prejudicar a produção leiteira de vacas da raça Holandesa. Um tratador aversivo realizou duas sessões diárias de um tratamento hostil (duas palmadas na região {{posterior}} e um grito forte), durante 21 dias, e um tratador neutro ordenhou as vacas, durante o mesmo período, não oferecendo nenhuma ameaça. A distância de fuga na presença do tratador aversivo e do neutro foi medida antes e 14 e 180 dias após o início do tratamento. As produções total e residual de leite (após aplicação i. v. de ocitocina na veia caudal) foram medidas a partir da ordenha realizada pelo tratador aversivo ou ou pelo neutro, entre os dias 14 e 24 do experimento. Todas as vacas (n= 13) participaram dos dois tratamentos, constituindo um delineamento experimental do tipo "cross-over". Com exceção do período anterior ao experimento, as vacas mantiveram maior distância de fuga do tratador aversivo que do neutro, mesmo 180 dias após o último contato com os tratadores. Entretanto, não houve efeito do tratamento sobre a produção total ou residual de leite. Os resultados corroboram outros estudos que comprovaram que vacas discriminam tratadores aversivos de neutros. Entretanto, o tratamento aqui aplicado não afetou as produções total ou residual de leite. In {{the present}} study the hypothesis that fear of humans is long-lasting and may influence milk production in Holstein cows was tested. One person (the aversive handler) carried out two daily sessions of an aversive treatment during 21 days, where each cow received two slaps on the rump and a strong yell. The control handler walked around the cows not menacing the cows. Flight distance from both handlers was measured before the treatments were imposed and 14 and 180 days later. Total and <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> (measured after an i. v. oxytocin injection in the caudal vein) were measured when either the aversive or the neutral handler carried out the milking, between days 14 and 24 of the experiment. All the cows were used in both treatments in a cross-over design. Except for the day before treatments started, the cows kept a larger distance from the aversive than from the neutral handler, even after 180 days without contact with these handlers. Nevertheless, there was no effect of treatment on total milk yield or <b>residual</b> <b>milk.</b> The results corroborate others that show that cows can discriminate between aversive and neutral individuals. Under the conditions of {{the present study}}, the fact that milking was done by the aversive individual did not influence total milk yield and <b>residual</b> <b>milk...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine the parenteral dosage of the trace mineral copper (Cu) which re-establishes serum and hepatic levels in hypocupperhemic animals without causing intoxication in the liver or <b>residuals</b> in <b>milk.</b> The experiment was carried out in two phases; in the first phase, 20 hypocupperhemic animals were used. Those were divided into 4 groups of 5 cows each: 3 groups which received 25, 50 and 100 mg of Cu respectively and 1 control group without supplementation, but with induced copraemia 5 days before and after the treatment. The milk of the cows treated with 100 mg Cu was examined for residuals of this element for one month. In the second phase, 25 animals were selected and divided into 5 groups of 5 cows each: 1 control group and 4 groups which received 25, 50, 100 and 200 mg of Cu respectively. The impact of this Cu dosages on liver reserves of this element, on hepatic enzymes (alanine-amine-transaminase, aspartate-amine-transferase, alkaline phosphatase and glutamate dehydrogenase) and on bilirubin was analyzed. The groups treated with 50 and 100 mg Cu showed increased levels in blood serum and hepatic tissues (P < 0. 05) in comparison to the control group and the one treated with 25 mg, obtaining the physiological level considered normal in cows during 60 days without an effect to the level of Cu in milk or to the liver’s enzymatic activity. We conclude that treatment with this dosage results in a restoration of the Cu concentration in blood serum and hepatic tissues without toxic effects or residuals...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Transmission {{of human}} {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) through breast-feeding may involve both cell-free and cell-associated virus. This latter viral reservoir remains, however, to be fully explored. CD 4 + T cell-associated virus production in breast milk was therefore investigated. Methods The ex vivo spontaneous production of HIV- 1 antigen and HIV- 1 RNA by CD 4 + T cells was measured in paired blood and breast milk samples from 15 HIV- 1 infected women treated or not with antiretroviral drugs. Spontaneous antigen secreting cells (HIV- 1 -AgSCs) from breast milk and blood were enumerated by an ELISpot assay, and cell-associated HIV- 1 RNA was quantified by real-time PCR in supernatants of CD 4 + T cells cultured for 18 hours without addition of polyclonal activators. Results Among the CD 4 + T cells present in breast milk, memory cells expressing high levels of cell-surface activation markers were predominant. Spontaneous HIV- 1 -AgSCs were detected and enumerated in the breast milk of all 15 women, with a median number of 13. 0 and 9. 5 HIV- 1 - AgSCs/ 106 CD 4 + T cells in aviremic (n = 7) and viremic (n = 8) women, respectively. Cell- associated HIV- 1 RNA was detected in cell-free supernatants from 4 / 7 aviremic and 5 / 8 viremic individuals at median levels of 190 and 245 copies/ml, respectively. Conclusions Activated CD 4 + T cells producing HIV- 1 are detected in the breast milk of untreated individuals {{as well as those}} receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. This finding strongly suggests that HIV- 1 replication occurs in latently infected CD 4 + T cells that, upon spontaneous activation, revert to productively infected cells. These cells might be responsible for a <b>residual</b> breast <b>milk</b> transmission despite maternal highly active antiretroviral therapy. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHigh {{pressure}} homogenization (HPH) is {{an alternative}} food processing technique. As product heating is minimum, its characteristics are not affected in a large extend. At this work, the <b>residual</b> activity of <b>milk</b> native enzymes (alkaline phosphatese and lactoperoxidase) was measured in skin milk treated by HPH. Results showed that pressures up to 250 MPa promoted decrease on activity about 10 - 20 % and pressures above 270 MPa resulted in total inactivation of the enzyme, probably indicating a process condition (pressure and temperature of homogenization) able to promote irreversible denaturation on the molecular structure of the protein. The results obtained for lactoperoxidase indicated that this enzyme is resistant to HPH as to heat treatment. At pressures between 100 and 250 MPa it was observed an increase on enzymatic activity (around 20 %) and just at 300 MPa a reduction of around 30 %, was detected. The increase of lactoperoxidase activity {{may be attributed to}} active sites exposure due to changes on tridimensional structure of the enzyme. The results indicate that residual activity of both enzymes can be used as indicative of pressure level applied in the milk during HPH process, considering the need of pressures above to 250 MPa to reaches enough microbial inactivation...|$|R
40|$|Milk flow in nine {{primiparous}} cows with disturbed {{milk ejection}} (D) and in six corresponding control animals (C) with normal milk removal was recorded during machine milking and blood samples were taken {{before and during}} milking to determine plasma oxytocin, vasopressin. prolactin, cortisol, oestradiol- 17 β, luteinizing hormone, progesterone and β-endorphin concentrations. Manual teat stimulation before milking lasted for 1 min. After milk flow had stopped, air was blown into the vagina for 2 min. When milk flow had stopped again, 1 i. u. oxytocin and finally 10 i. u. oxytocin were injected to remove <b>residual</b> <b>milk.</b> During and after teat stimulation, oxytocin remained basal in D, but increased in C, whereas prolactin increased in both groups. While 94 % of total milk was obtained in C during this period, only 9 % could be removed from D, indicating lack of alveolar milk ejection. During vaginal stimulation, oxytocin increased transiently in D and more than by teat stimulation in C. This allowed the removal of 75 % of milk in D, whereas almost no more milk was available in C. After oxytocin injections, 3 and 16 % of <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> were obtained in C and D respectively. Basal oestradiol- 17 β concentration was higher in D than in C (11 · 6 and 2 · 0 ng/ 1 respectively), whereas β-endorphin level was lower (24 · 1 and 86 · 6 μg/ 1 respectively). Basal concentration of luteinizing hormone and progesterone, and concentration of cortisol and vasopressin before and during milking were comparable in C and D. We conclude that in cows with disturbed milk ejection afferent nervous pathways to the hypothalamus were intact, because prolactin was released by teat stimulation. However, oxytocin was only released by vaginal stimulation, i. e. milk ejection was centrally inhibited during teat stimulatio...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} on restricted suckling of crossbred dairy cows {{was conducted at}} the Livestock Research Centre, Tanga in northeast Tanzania. Thirty-six Bos taurus (Holstein Friesian and Jersey) x Bos indicus (East African Zebu) cows were allocated alternately as they calved to suckling their calves for either 12 or 24 weeks after calving. Cows grazed improved pastures and were offered 4 kg concentrate daily. Milking occurred twice daily by hand; calves were allowed to suck <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> for 30 min following each milking. Calves were also allowed access to grazing and were offered a maximum of I kg concentrate daily to 24 weeks of age. Weaning age had no significant effect on lactation milk yield for human consumption, the mean (SE) yield being 1806 (102. 0) L and 1705 (129. 1) L for 12 - and 24 -week weaning, respectively. Cows from the two treatments suffered similar losses of live weight and body condition score during lactation and neither group {{had returned to the}} original body condition score 40 weeks following calving. Post-partum anoestrous intervals were prolonged. Although not significant, cows suckling calves to 24 weeks had a mean interval to first oestrus extended by 38 days compared with cows suckling calves to 12 weeks. The mean (SE) daily live weight gains of the calves to 52 weeks were 263 (14. 1) g/day and 230 (18. 1) g/day for calves weaned at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively, such that 12 -month weights were 119 (5. 6) kg and 110 (7. 3) kg, respectively. Twelve-week-weaned calves consumed more concentrate (p < 0. 05) from 13 to 24 weeks than did 24 -week weaned calves. Calculation of <b>residual</b> <b>milk</b> consumption removed by calves from birth to 12 weeks indicated that it accounted for 28 % of total yield. No benefits in cow and calf performance and welfare were found to justify prolonging the suckling period to 24 weeks...|$|E

Heritability from the paternal half-sib correlation among records of daughters of sampling sires was similar for registered and nonregistered cows. Differences in heritability in different years and class of herd production {{were similar to those}} found in previous analyses that ignored registry status. Residual variances were similar for records of registered and nonregistered cows. Differences in variances by year and class of herd production also were similar to those found in previous analyses. <b>Residual</b> variances of <b>milk</b> records increased with time and class of herd production and in the same year were distinctly larger in herds with higher production than in herds with lower production.

40|$|Psychrotrophics {{microorganisms}} {{are able}} to multiply under refrigeration temperatures. They can produce heat-resistant extracellular enzymes that cause organoleptic and structural changes in milk and dairy products. With the objective of determining the frequency of microorganisms in the dairy process, four farms were evaluated in Londrina city – Brazil and different points were assessed. Mesophilic (48 hs at 35 oC), psychrotrophic (25 hs at 21 oC) and proteolytic (72 hs at 22 oC) microorganisms were researched, and the proteolytic predominant microflora were determined by using the Gram stain technique. The main psychrotrophic contamination points were the <b>residual</b> water on <b>milk</b> cans, on bulk tank and bad cleaned teats, and milk cans and teats {{were the most important}} sources of proteolytics. Gram negative bacilli represented 69 % of the microorganisms in the refrigerated milk that means 45 % of the total proteolytics microorganisms in the dairy process. Gram negative bacilli is most frequent on bad cleaned teats, teatcups, <b>residual</b> water in <b>milk</b> cans and bulk tank. The psychrotroph count in the refrigerated milk was more than the mesophilic count, showing that that psychrotrophics are the best indicatator for refrigerated milk contamination. The psycrotrophics count at all points assessed were greater than the ideal limit (10 % of the mesophilic count). Thus as refrigeration at 4 oC is not sufficient to control the multiplication of the psycrotrophics group, good practices should be associated to avoid or control milk contamination by psycrotrophics. Os psicrotróficos são microrganismos que têm capacidade de multiplicação em temperaturas de refrigeração. Produzem enzimas termorresistentes como proteases e lipases que promovem alterações organolépticas no leite e comprometem a produção de derivados. Com o objetivo de determinar a freqüência desses microrganismos a produção do leite, foram estudadas 04 propriedades da região de Londrina, PR, analisando diversos pontos do processo. Determinou-se a contagem de microrganismos aeróbios mesófilos (48 hs a 35 ºC), psicrotróficos (25 hs a 21 ºC), psicrotróficos proteolíticos (72 hs a 22 ºC) e as características morfotintoriais da microbiota psicrotrófica proteolítica predominante. Os principais pontos de contaminação por psicrotróficos foram a água residual de latões, tanques de expansão e tetos higienizados inadequadamente, sendo que os psicrotróficos proteolíticos predominam nos latões e tetos. Bacilos Gram negativos representaram 45 % da microbiota proteolítica de todo o processo de produção, no leite refrigerado corresponderam a 69 % dos psicrotróficos proteolíticos encontrados e ainda predominaram nos tetos higienizados, teteiras, água residual de latões e tanques de expansão. As contagens de psicrotróficos superaram as de mesófilos em leite refrigerado, mostrando que a pesquisa de psicrotróficos é ideal para avaliar a real carga microbiana do leite refrigerado. Como a refrigeração a 4 oC não inibe o crescimento deste grupo de microrganismos, deve-se evitar sua incorporação ao leite durante a produção, havendo necessidade da adoção de boas práticas de manejo em todo o processo produtivo...|$|R
