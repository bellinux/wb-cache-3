The 12th National Congress required that the CCDI head serve concurrently on the PSC, but this was <b>rescinded</b> by Zhao Ziyang at the 13th National Congress in 1987. Although most of Zhao Ziyang's reforms were later themselves <b>rescinded,</b> concurrent PSC membership was not reintroduced until the 15th National Congress in 1997.|$|E

5|$|In 1903, it {{was normal}} for a {{professional}} cyclist to hire pacers, who would lead them during the race. Desgrange forbade this: it was originally intended that in the final, longest, stage pacers would be allowed, but this was <b>rescinded</b> after the fifth stage.|$|E
40|$|The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) {{provides}} borrowers with protections and remedies against certain {{actions by}} lenders. TILA allows, in some circumstances, a borrower to <b>rescind</b> a loan from a lender within {{a three-year period}} from when the loan is made. However, a circuit split has developed regarding how the right to <b>rescind</b> must be exercised. Of the circuits that have considered this question, some require a lawsuit to be filed within the three-year period to <b>rescind</b> the loan. Other circuits have held that providing notice of the intent to <b>rescind</b> the loan within the three-year period is sufficient to <b>rescind</b> the loan, even if a lawsuit is not filed until beyond the three-year time limit. This Comment argues {{that in order to}} <b>rescind</b> the loan, courts should require that an actual lawsuit be filed before the three-year period expires...|$|R
50|$|In {{legislative}} bodies, {{the motion}} to <b>rescind</b> is used for much the same purpose as {{the motion to}} reconsider; many court decisions treat the two motions as one motion. However, in legislative contexts, {{it is not the}} same as a motion to repeal. The difference between <b>rescind</b> and reconsider is that the motion to <b>rescind</b> is ordinarily applied to actions that have been taken and are already in effect. It has been described as being in the nature of a motion to amend by striking out the entire proposal and leaving nothing remaining. It is not in order when the question can be reached by a motion to reconsider. Once legislation has been actually enacted, it is too late to <b>rescind.</b> The vote required to <b>rescind</b> is the same as would be required to repeal the act which it sought to <b>rescind</b> (usually a majority).|$|R

25|$|Despite {{more than}} 20 {{institutions}} <b>rescinding</b> Cosby's degrees, several others {{refused to do}} so, often citing their policy never to <b>rescind</b> anyone's degree for any reason. Most of these schools nevertheless included statements abhorring Cosby's conduct.|$|R

5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} <b>rescinded</b> in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely <b>rescinded</b> in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that the photographers were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E

50|$|Two other {{techniques}} {{to prevent the}} assignment of contracts are rescission clauses or clauses creating a condition subsequent.
