Midway through the season, Hornish replaced A. J. Allmendinger in Penske's No. 22 car after Allmendinger was suspended by NASCAR for failing a drug test. Allmendinger qualified in eighth place, but due to the driver change Hornish had {{to move to the}} rear of the field. He finished 33rd, after a mid-race crash required ten laps of <b>repair</b> <b>time.</b> Hornish drove the car in the remaining races, with a season-best fifth place at Watkins Glen. Aside from that race, his best finishes were a trio of eleventh places at Atlanta, Richmond and Chicagoland. Hornish's best start of the season was fourth at Dover, where he finished 25th (seven laps behind).|$|E
25|$|The Vikings and the New York Giants {{had been}} {{scheduled}} to play a football game on the afternoon of December 12. The game had already been postponed to Monday night, the 13th, due to concerns of stadium officials. Because of the tears in the roof, the NFL relocated the game to Ford Field in Detroit. The league considered moving that game to the University of Minnesota's nearby TCF Bank Stadium, but it had been shut down and winterized for the season and would have needed several days to prepare for a football game. Tickets to the game were free, and the Giants ended up winning the game. Due to roof <b>repair</b> <b>time</b> estimates, the Vikings December 20 game against the Chicago Bears was moved to TCF Bank Stadium. The final two games for the 2010 Minnesota Vikings season already were scheduled as road games, and the team had already been eliminated from the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|Like Rivette's earlier film La Belle Noiseuse, {{the main}} themes are romantic longing, impermanence, and identity, but this film adds {{the themes of}} mortality, chance, and destiny, and motifs are {{repeated}} from Rivette's Celine and Julie Go Boating. The name of Julien's cat, Nevermore, evokes Poe's The Raven and its similar themes of death and longing. Julien's work as a clockmaker, literally trying to <b>repair</b> <b>time,</b> is an obvious metaphor, and the film is also timeless, giving no indication of when it is set. The blackmail sub-plot is a device to help tell the central love story between Marie and Julien and to explain Marie's situation; Julien is an unlikely blackmailer and Madame X's benevolence towards him is surprising. The plot features dream logic impinging on reality: Senses of Cinema highlighted the role of [...] "outlandish chance" [...] and Film Comment noted {{the feeling that the}} characters are inventing or re-enacting the narrative.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis examines the forecast accuracy of <b>repair</b> <b>times</b> for {{a subset of}} repairable U. S Navy inventory items. Forecasts are currently calculated using the Uniform Inventory Control Program (UICP) on a quarterly basis. The UICP model use the <b>time</b> of <b>repairs</b> completed in the current quarter to update a "file" value in order to forecast the <b>repair</b> <b>times</b> for the following quarter. Forecasts are calculated separately for repairable items grouped into families. This thesis demonstrates that aggregation repairs by their completion dates, as currently done by the UICP model, causes forecast {{to be affected by}} the nature of the repair arrival process. The more that this process differs from a Poisson process, the more that the forecast values are affected. Using bootstrap simulations, the effect of the repair process on the forecasting is quantified. This thesis also explores alternatives to the UICP model for forecasting <b>repair</b> <b>times.</b> In particular, an approach that utilizes repairs that have not been completed by the end of the current quarter is developed.
