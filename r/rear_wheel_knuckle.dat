50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> drive {{vehicles}} today frequently use {{a fairly}} complex fully independent, multi-link suspension {{to locate the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> securely while providing decent ride quality.|$|R
5000|$|One {{variation}} {{is to have}} a 29" [...] front wheel and a 26" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> (commonly called a [...] "96er"). Using the smaller <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> allows shorter and quicker handling frames, more options for rear suspension designs and lighter bicycle weight. Another {{variation is}} to have a 26" [...] front wheel with a 29" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> (commonly called a [...] "69er" [...] though Trek introduced a [...] "69er" [...] in 2007 with a 29" [...] front wheel and a 26" [...] <b>rear</b> <b>wheel).</b>|$|R

50|$|The system {{electronically}} controlled a rear rack {{that was}} behind the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> At low speeds (up to 35 km/h), the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> move {{in the opposite direction}} from the front wheels, aiding parking and U-turns by lowering the turning circle. Above these speeds, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> move {{in the same direction as}} the front, meaning control during high-speed maneuvers such as lane changes or cornering was improved. Either way, the turning angle of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> was slight at just 5°, a measurement Mazda determined to be optimally effective and natural to human sensitivity.|$|R
2500|$|... 3) Three-channel, three-sensor ABS: This scheme, {{commonly}} found on pickup trucks with four-wheel ABS, has a speed sensor and a valve {{for each of}} the front wheels, with one valve and one sensor for both <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> The speed sensor for the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. The <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> however, are monitored together; they both have to start to lock up before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

50|$|Most torque {{vectoring}} differentials are on all-wheel drive vehicles. A basic {{torque vectoring}} differential varies torque between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> This means that, under normal driving conditions, the front wheels receive a set percentage of the engine torque, and the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> receive the rest. If needed, the differential can transfer more torque between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to improve vehicle performance.|$|R

50|$|E-4WD is {{a system}} used by Nissan that drives two <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> with an {{electric}} motor to supplement the traction available to a front wheel drive vehicle. This avoids the complication of installing a drive shaft to transfer power to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> It also increases efficiency as when additional traction is not needed the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> can be completely disengaged from the drive train. The system was developed by Hitachi.|$|R
50|$|For {{driving in}} {{particularly}} challenging conditions, such as snow, the driver can select “4WD Lock” mode. In Lock mode, the system still apportions {{front and rear}} torque automatically, but enables greater power transfer to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> In dry conditions, 4WD Lock mode places priority on performance. More torque is directed to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> than in 4WD Auto mode to provide greater power off the line, better control when accelerating on snowy or loose surfaces, and enhanced stability at high speeds. <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> torque transfer is increased by 50 percent over the amounts in 4WD Auto mode - meaning up to 60 percent of available torque {{is sent to the}} <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> under full-throttle acceleration on dry pavement. When in 4WD Lock mode, torque at the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> is reduced by a smaller degree through corners than with 4WD Auto mode.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper discuses sensor {{steering}} mechanism (SSM) for a laterally guided vehicle with a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> {{steering mechanism}}. The authors {{have demonstrated the}} geometry of SSMs for front wheel steering type and reverse phase four-wheel steering type vehicles. SSMs allow stable lateral guiding performance for automated vehicles following a path with straight and curved portions created by a guideway. On other hand, no SSM has been established for a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering type vehicle. <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering vehicles include forklifts and backward moving conventional motor vehicles which are front wheel vehicles. A SSM for <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering vehicles would enable a forklift to move into any spaces using automation. This paper proposes a SSM relation for a <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering vehicle and describes the construction of experimental robotic vehicle with the proposed SSM. Simulated and an experimental data show {{the advantages of the}} proposed SSM...|$|R

50|$|The kite buggy's <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> {{are mounted}} {{at the ends}} of the rear axle. The front wheel is mounted in the front fork. In {{advanced}} buggy designs either or both front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> can be attached via suspension mechanisms.|$|R
5000|$|The {{automatic}} transmission used on AWD equipped vehicles would normally send 90% {{of the engines}} torque to the front wheels and 10% to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate transfer clutch. When the front wheels began to experience a loss of grip, the transmission automatically sent available torque to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> up to 50:50 split between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> until grip was reestablished at the front wheels, without notifying the driver or occupants that torque was being redirected. When accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicles weight shifts rearward, reducing front wheel traction, causing the transmission to automatically send torque to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards the front, reducing <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to the front wheels for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in Reverse or [...] "1st" [...] gear, the transmission divides the torque 50:50 to both front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> A limited slip rear differential was optional on the 1991 USA Sport Sedan (Legacy Turbo). However it was unavailable on the 92-94 USA Turbo.|$|R

5000|$|As first {{implemented}} in the Acura RL, SH-AWD allows torque to be continuously distributed between front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> from 70% front/30% rear to 30% front/70% rear, with up to 100% of the rear power being distributed to the outer left or right wheel to assist in cornering and dramatically reducing understeer. For example, in straight line full throttle acceleration, the RL is capable of distributing 40% of torque to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> and 60% to the front wheels. In a hard turn, of percentage of power distributed to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels,</b> up to 100% of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> power can be distributed to the single, outer <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> This action will push the rear around the corner, and helping with steering, reducing understeer and keeping the car balanced and controlled. [...] The effect can be likened to steering in a row boat where applying more power to one oar can turn the boat.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an active}} four-wheel {{steering}} system, all four wheels {{turn at the}} same time when the driver steers. In most active four-wheel steering systems, the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> are steered by a computer and actuators. The <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> generally cannot turn as far as the front wheels. There can be controls to switch off the rear steer and options to steer only the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> independently of the front wheels. At low speed (e.g. parking) the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn opposite to the front wheels, reducing the turning radius, sometimes critical for large trucks, tractors, vehicles with trailers and passenger cars with a large wheelbase, while at higher speeds both front and <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> turn alike (electronically controlled), so that the vehicle may change position with less yaw and improved build-up of the lateral acceleration, enhancing straight-line stability. The [...] "snaking effect" [...] experienced during motorway drives while towing a travel trailer is thus largely nullified.|$|R
25|$|On any {{bike with}} only <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases <b>rear</b> <b>wheel</b> braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the braking power when braking hard.|$|R
50|$|A tadpole {{tricycle}} has {{two front}} <b>wheels</b> and one <b>rear</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering is sometimes used, although this increases the turning circle and can affect handling (the geometry {{is similar to}} a regular tricycle operating in reverse, but with a steering damper added).|$|R
50|$|<b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> {{steering}} {{tends to}} be unstable because in turns the steering geometry changes hence decreasing the turn radius (over steer), rather than increase it (under steer). <b>Rear</b> <b>wheel</b> steering is meant for slower vehicles that need high-maneuverability in tight spaces, e.g. fork lifts.|$|R
5000|$|As {{described}} earlier, SH-AWD {{can vary}} torque {{side to side}} through the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels.</b> This ability to drive one of the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> with more power (remember the row boat analogy) is accomplished through overdriving the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> {{with respect to the}} front wheels. The Acura RL is designed with a third planetary gear set and clutch pack that are packaged into a so-called [...] "Acceleration Device", which is bolted in front of the rear differential unit. [...] The Acceleration Device allows torque to be passed to the <b>rear</b> <b>wheels</b> at a near one to one ratio, but in cornering situations, the Acceleration Device variably increases the torque passed to the rear up to 5%, depending on the cornering situation.|$|R
