The ACLU supported several measures, including the 1970 Fair Credit Reporting Act required credit agencies to divulge credit information to individuals; the 1973 Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which provided students the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> their records; and the 1974 Privacy Act which prevented the federal government from disclosing personal information without good cause.|$|E

25|$|The 1994 reform {{introduces}} {{several new}} legal figures: amparo judicial (an injunction), habeas corpus and habeas data.

40|$|The legal {{position}} of asylum seekers in South African {{social security system}} is more nuanced {{as a result of}} their transitional stay or status in the country. Asylum seekers may often be present in South Africa for a quite a long time but their social security entitlement is more restricted, and similar to that of temporary residents. For example, asylum seekers’ social security position is completely different from that of refugees. Refugees enjoy the same social security treatment similarly to South African citizens and permanent residents. Refugees qualify for the constitutionally entrenched <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security, including appropriate social assistance. Refugees also qualify for other socio-economic rights contained in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The exclusion of asylum seekers occurs despite the fact they are one of the vulnerable groups of noncitizens. Such exclusion forces asylum seekers to live under precarious conditions. It is fundamentally accepted that the drafters of the Constitution included the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security, in order to ensure that everyone, irrespective of nationality and citizenship enjoys an acceptable standard of living. It is also fundamentally accepted that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security contained in section 27 (1) (c) is limited by section 27 (2) of the Constitution. Section 27 (2) requires the State to take reasonable legislative measures, within its available resources, to achieve the progressive realisation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security. The South African courts had on several occasions confirmed that the content of section 27 (1) (c) is limited by section 27 (2) of the Constitution and that the state cannot implement the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security on demand. It had also been confirmed that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security is enforceable. This means the beneficiaries of this right may seek recourse from the courts of law when they are not satisfied about the progress relating to the implementation of the programmes relevant <b>to</b> the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security is also limited by section 36 (1) of the Constitution. In the international arena, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have <b>access</b> <b>to</b> social security is recognised as the entitlement of everyone, but in some instances differential treatment can be made by the states. Such differential treatment should serve the legitimate state objective and all noncitizens should be treated equally...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> {{reproduce}} {{and found}} a family are recognized as basic human rights.

Both positive and negative <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> assisted reproductive technologies are required in order to fully realize the reproductive rights. However, {{there is a limit to}} such a claim. The positive <b>right</b> of individuals <b>to</b> have state-funded assisted reproductive treatments has to be balanced against the provision of other societal goods and healthcare rationing. The negative <b>right</b> <b>to</b> acquire <b>access</b> <b>to</b> assisted reproductive technologies by individuals' own resources is also restrained. The barrier <b>to</b> such <b>access</b> is often of a moral nature, the standard of which depends on the values of the society. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|Reproductive rights {{represents}} a broad concept, that may include {{some or all}} of the following rights: the right to legal or safe abortion, the right to control one's reproductive functions, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> quality reproductive healthcare, and the right to education and access in order to make reproductive choices free from coercion, discrimination, and violence. Reproductive rights may also be understood to include education about contraception and sexually transmitted infections. Reproductive rights are often defined to include freedom from female genital mutilation (FGM), and forced abortion and forced sterilization. The Istanbul Convention recognizes these two rights at Article 38 – Female genital mutilation and Article 39 – Forced abortion and forced sterilisation.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Capital Territory {{provides}} {{same-sex couples}} with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> a civil union. Under the federal laws, same-sex relationships {{are treated as}} de facto relationships. In August 2012, the ACT's Civil Union Bill passed after legal advice demonstrated {{that the federal government}} had removed its ability to legislate for territorial and state same-sex marriage after it defined marriage as only between man and woman in the Marriage Amendment Act 2004. The Civil Union Act 2012 grants many of the same rights to same-sex couples as people married under the Marriage Act. The act was not challenged by the Gillard Federal Government. The act was to be repealed and civil unions were to be no longer accessible to same-sex couples upon commencement of the Marriage Equality (Same Sex) Act 2013, which (if not struck down by the High Court) would have permanently legalised same-sex marriage in the territory. Due to the High Court's ruling striking down the ACT's same-sex marriage law as invalid, the repeal of the Civil Unions Act 2012 is of no effect and civil unions continue to take place in the ACT.|$|E
25|$|With the {{outbreak}} of World War I, the ICRC found itself confronted with enormous challenges that it could handle only by {{working closely with the}} national Red Cross societies. Red Cross nurses from around the world, including the United States and Japan, came to support the medical services of the armed forces of the European countries involved in the war. On 15 October 1914, immediately after the start of the war, the ICRC set up its International Prisoners-of-War (POW) Agency, which had about 1,200 mostly volunteer staff members by the end of 1914. By the end of the war, the Agency had transferred about 20 million letters and messages, 1.9 million parcels, and about 18 million Swiss francs in monetary donations to POWs of all affected countries. Furthermore, due to the intervention of the Agency, about 200,000 prisoners were exchanged between the warring parties, released from captivity and returned to their home country. The organizational card index of the Agency accumulated about 7 million records from 1914 to 1923, each card representing an individual prisoner or missing person. The card index led to the identification of about 2 million POWs and the ability to contact their families. The complete index is on loan today from the ICRC to the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Museum in Geneva. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the index is still strictly restricted to the ICRC.|$|E
