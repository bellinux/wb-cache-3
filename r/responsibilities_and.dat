5|$|Design {{management}} {{is not a}} standard model that can be projected onto every enterprise, nor is there a specific way of applying it that leads to guaranteed success.

Design {{management is}} multifaceted, {{and so are the}} different applications of and views on design management.

The increase of social <b>responsibility</b> <b>and</b> level of empowerment were influenced by implementation of good government of local organization, income, and formal education.

5|$|Massachusetts, {{along with}} the five other New England states, {{features}} the local governmental structure known as the New England town. In this structure, incorporated towns—as opposed to townships or counties—hold many of the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> powers of local government. Most of the county governments were abolished {{by the state of}} Massachusetts beginning in 1997 including Middlesex County, the largest county in the state by population. The voters of these now defunct counties elect only Sheriffs and Registers of Deeds, who are part of the state government. Other counties have been reorganized, and a few still retain county councils.|$|E

5|$|Saudi Arabia is an {{absolute}} monarchy, and has no legally binding written constitution. However, in 1992, the Basic Law of Saudi Arabia was adopted by royal decree. The Basic Law outlines the <b>responsibilities</b> <b>and</b> processes of the governing institutions but is insufficiently specific {{to be considered a}} constitution. It declares that the king must comply with Sharia (that is, Islamic law) and that the Quran and the Sunna (the traditions of Muhammad) are the country's constitution. Interpretation of the Quran and the Sunna remains necessary, and this is carried out by the ulema, the Saudi religious establishment.|$|E

Most regional airports, including Førde, were nationalized in 1996 and transferred to the CAA, later renamed Avinor.

Trade with the Sakalava kingdom enabled this king to increase the firearms, cannons and gunpowder available for the defense of the kingdom, and expanded the availability of luxury items like silver piastres and porcelain dishes.

In the absence of both senior and junior consuls from the city, the Urban praetor governed Rome, and presided over the Roman Senate and Roman assemblies. Other praetors had foreign affairs-related <b>responsibilities,</b> <b>and</b> often acted as governors of the provinces. Since praetors held imperium powers, they could command an army.|$|E
