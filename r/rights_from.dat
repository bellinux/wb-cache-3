5|$|Chelvanayakam's non-violent methods {{proved to}} be {{ineffective}} against Snihalese-Buddhist nationalism and failed to secure Tamils' <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> successive governments. With his death the era of non-violent protest was replaced by violent militancy.|$|E
5|$|A {{partnership}} between Bobby Orr Enterprises and Harold Ballard bought the broadcast <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> Hockey Canada for $750,000. The bid, negotiated by Alan Eagleson, who, at the time, was both Orr's agent and a Hockey Canada director, outbid McLaren Advertising, producers of Hockey Night in Canada, which had offered $500,000. Ballard-Orr realized a profit on {{the series of}} $1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|Assignment {{is an area}} of both English {{contract}} law and the law of real estate that governs the transfer of <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> one party to another. This can include the right to enforce a debt. In this situation the party who is assigned the debt can sue the debtor despite any contractual agreement between them. Again, this is permitted by statute, specifically the Law of Property Act 1925.|$|E

5|$|Section 2 {{protects the}} right to vote only of adult males, not adult females, making it the only {{provision}} of the Constitution to explicitly discriminate on the basis of sex. Section 2 was condemned by women's suffragists, such as Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, who had long seen their cause as linked to that of black rights. The separation of black civil <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> women's civil rights split the two movements for decades.|$|E

5|$|A {{series of}} {{fourteen}} films based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories were released between 1939 and 1946; the British actors Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce played Holmes and Dr. John Watson, respectively. The first two {{films in the}} series were produced by 20th Century Fox and released in 1939. The studio stopped making the films after these, but Universal Studios acquired the <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> the Doyle estate and produced a further twelve films.|$|E
5|$|Alexander, the {{previous}} MacDonald leader, had made land grants to the eldest and youngest sons of Lachlan MacLean, grandson of Alexander's aunt. John Garbh (the youngest son) now obtained Rùm (possibly, Alexander had quitclaimed it to him); like Hugh's gains, Clan Ranald objected to this transfer. Traditional accounts claim that John Garbh purchased a quitclaim of Clan Ranald <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> their leader, Allan, {{by giving them}} a galley; though the galley looked in good quality, the interior (so the legend says) was rotten, hence explaining Clan Ranald's refusal to accept John Garbh's ownership of Rùm. John Garbh subsequently seized Allan, and held him prisoner on Coll for 9 months; presumably Allan was only released once he had agreed to acknowledge the exchange.|$|E

5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of <b>Rights</b> <b>from</b> the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the right to bear arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
5|$|Beatty had {{a concept}} for a Dick Tracy film in 1975. At the time, the film rights were owned by Michael Laughlin, {{who gave up}} his option from Tribune Media Services after he was {{unsuccessful}} in pitching Dick Tracy to Hollywood studios. Floyd Mutrux and Art Linson purchased the film <b>rights</b> <b>from</b> the Tribune in 1977, and, in 1980, United Artists became interested in financing/distributing Dick Tracy. Tom Mankiewicz was under negotiations to write the script, based on his previous success with Superman (1978) and Superman II (1980). The deal fell through when Chester Gould insisted on strict financial and artistic control.|$|E
