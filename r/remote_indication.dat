40|$|Intrusion analysis, i. e., {{the process}} of combing through Intrusion Detection System (IDS) alerts and audit logs to {{identify}} true successful and attempted attacks, remains a difficult problem in practical network security defense. The primary cause of this problem is the high false positive rate in IDS system sensors used to detect malicious activity. This high false positive rate is attributed to an inability to differentiate nearly certain attacks from those that are merely possible. This inefficacy has created high uncertainty in intrusion analysis and consequently causing an overwhelming amount of work for security analysts. As a solution, practitioners typically resort to a specific IDS-rules set that precisely captures specific attacks. However, this results in failure to discern other forms of the targeted attack because an attack’s polymorphism reflects human intelligence.

Southern elephant seal (SES) vision is adapted to low intensity light with a peak sensitivity, matching the wavelength emitted by myctophid species, one of the main prey of female SES. A total of 11 satellite-tracked female SES were equipped with a Time-Depth-Light 3 D-accelerometers (TDR 10 -X) in order to assess whether bioluminescence could be used by SES to locate their prey. First, we demonstrated experimentally that the TDR 10 -X light sensor was sensitive enough to detect natural bioluminescence; however, we highlighted a low distance detection of the sensor. Then, we linked the number of Prey Capture Attempts (PCA), assessed from accelerometer data, with the number of detected bioluminescence events. PCA was positively related to bioluminescence, which provides strong support that bioluminescence is involved in predator-prey interactions for these species. However, the limitations of the sensor did not allow us to discern whether bioluminescence (i) provided <b>remote</b> <b>indication</b> of the biological richness of the area to SES, (ii) was emitted as a mechanic reaction, or (iii) was emitted as a defense mechanism in response to SES behaviour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a {{pressure}} transmitter using a modified op-amp based network for inductance measurement using a bellow as sensor {{has been proposed}} to measure the pressure and to convert pressure changes in to an electrical current which can be transmitted to a remote indicator. The change in inductance due to change in pressure is measured by an improved modified operational amplifier based network. The proposed network permits offset inductance compensation of sensing coil and also minimizes the stray capacitance between sensing coil and ground using dummy inductor whose value equal to zero level inductance of sensing coil and op-amps with high input impedance. In {{the first part of}} experiment, a modified op-amp based inductance measuring circuit has been simulated using LabVIEW (Laboratory Virtual Instrument Engineering Workbench) and studied with test inductance, and in the second part, the experimentation was done by replacing the test inductance with a sensing coil fitted to bellow by means of ferromagnetic wire for the measurement of pressure. It has been observed that the variation in gauge pressure from 0 to 70 psi having linear relationship with output ac voltage in the range of 0 to 85. 0 mV.

40|$|Without {{knowledge}} of basic seafloor characteristics, {{the ability to}} address any number of critical marine and/or coastal management issues is diminished. For example, management and conservation of essential fish habitat (EFH), a requirement mandated by federally guided fishery management plans (FMPs), requires among other things a description of habitats for federally managed species. Although the list of attributes important to habitat are numerous, the ability to efficiently and effectively describe many, and especially at the scales required, does not exist with the tools currently available. However, several characteristics of seafloor morphology are readily obtainable at multiple scales and can serve as useful descriptors of habitat. Recent advancements in acoustic technology, such as multibeam echosounding (MBES), can provide <b>remote</b> <b>indication</b> of surficial sediment properties such as texture, hardness, or roughness, and further permit highly detailed renderings of seafloor morphology. With acoustic-based surveys providing a relatively efficient method for data acquisition, there exists a need for efficient and reproducible automated segmentation routines to process the data.

40|$|Este trabalho tem como objeto o estudo comparativo de duas ocorrências, em Língua Portuguesa, de manifestações artísticas em que homens emprestam seus textos a sujeitos-líricos femininos. Assim, a partir da análise de cantigas de amigo do Trovadorismo e de canções de Francisco Buarque de Hollanda, pretende-se encontrar os pontos de aproximação e de afastamento entre os textos. As chamadas “cantigas de amigo”, como indissolúveis uniões entre letra e música do estilo pagão medieval trovadoresco, destacam-se pelo empréstimo, por homens, de suas poesias a vozes femininas. Em tom confessional – e, por vezes, permeado por sensualidade e erotismo - o sujeito-lírico que assume as cantigas de amigo revela as tentativas masculinas de compreensão da alma feminina e de exposição de tal visão por meio das manifestações artísticas. E tudo isso, em um mundo profundamente misógino e regido pela noção de pecado, mostra-se como o tímido iniciar de mudanças que vão de encontro à falta de liberdade de pensamento e comportamento, e à visão do corpo como veículo do pecado. É o indício remoto das origens da modernidade. Como temáticas, as vozes poéticas femininas retrataram a liberdade, o amor, o erotismo, a sexualidade. E a abordagem de tais elementos, por compositores homens, mostra-se como a tradução da capacidade destes de, investigando os silêncios e os desejos femininos, evidenciarem o espírito e os sentidos das mulheres. O poeta, então, revela-se capaz de sentir o que elas sentem. Assim, a partir das percepções inferidas sobre as vozes femininas das cantigas de amigo e sobre o contexto no qual elas estão inseridas, será analisado um conjunto de canções de Chico Buarque de Hollanda em cujas letras o músico-compositor cede o extravasamento do sujeito a mulheres. Com base nas temáticas presentes na lírica trovadoresca (liberdade, amor, erotismo e sexualidade), então, uma seleta {{de letras}} de um dos mais representativos músicos da MPB será analisada, a fim de, ultrapassando-se os questionamentos sobre {{eventual}} influência do Trovadorismo em sua obra, chegar-se a comparações de aproximações ou distanciamentos. Para tanto, além de análises interpretativas dos textos de Chico Buarque – os quais, para efeitos deste estudo, serão lidos a partir dos conceitos e elementos do gênero lírico – serão apresentados, também, os posicionamentos de estudiosos da Literatura e, especialmente, de alguns autores que se debruçaram sobre o estudo da Música Popular Brasileira e sobre a obra musical de Chico Buarque. This work has as object the {{comparative study of}} two occurrences, in the Portuguese language, of artistic manifestations, where men borrow their texts to lyrical female subjects. Thus, from the analysis of troubadour songs of friend and songs by Francisco Buarque de Hollanda, we intend to find the connecting and the detachment points between the texts. The so called “songs of friends”, as indissoluble connections between lyrics and music of the medieval troubadour-like pagan style, stand out by the loan, by men, of their poems and female voices. In a confessional tone – and, sometimes, permeated by sensuality and eroticism – the lyrical subject, which assumes the songs of friend reveals the male attempts to understand the female soul and expose such a view through artistic manifestations. And all of this, in a deeply misogynous world ruled by the notion of sin, shows itself a shy beginning for changes which meet the lack of freedom of thought and behavior, and {{the view of the}} body as a sin vehicle. It is a <b>remote</b> <b>indication</b> of modernity. As issues, the female voices depict freedom, love, eroticism, sensuality. And the approach of such elements, by male composers, shows itself as the translation of their capacity of, by investigating the silences and the female desires, identifying the women spirit and senses. Therefore, the poet presents himself as capable of feeling the same as women do. Thus, from the perceptions inferred about the female voices of the songs of friend and about the context in which they are included, we will analyze a group of songs by Chico Buarque de Hollanda, whose lyrics the musician-composer transfers the externalization of the subject to women. Based on the issues present in the troubadour lyric (freedom, love, eroticism and sensuality) we will analyze a selection of lyrics by one of the most representative musicians of MPB, in order to, transcending the questioning about the eventual influence of Troubadour in his work, reach the comparisons of connections or detachment points. Therefore, in addition to the interpretative analyses of Chico Buarque’s texts – which, {{for the purpose of this}} study, will be read from de concepts and elements of the lyric genders – will be also presented the positioning of Literature scholars and, specially, of some authors who consider the study of the Popular Brazilian Music and the musical work of Chico Buarque...|$|E
40|$|Some authors (Veggiani, 1972; Castiglioni, 1978, Peretto, 1986) have {{evidenced}} {{the existence}} of palaochannel of the Po river delta which passed through the stretch of the present-day alluvial plain between Po and Adige rivers. A branch of this palaeochannel, called “ramo settentrionale del Po di Adria” extends from Rovigo to the lagoon of Venice near Chioggia. This multidisciplinary research provides sedimentological data and geomorphological evidence for {{the reconstruction of the}} stratigraphical architecture of the alluvial ridge, evolution of the palaeohydrography and the age of deactivation of this Po branch which is debated (De Bon, 1939, Bosio, 1967, Veggiani, 1972) because archeological and large scale palaeoclimatic considerations alone are not conclusive. Remote sensing from Landsat TM and Aster images allowed to analyze major landforms while the interpretation of oblique and vertical panchromatic aerial photos gave a finer detection of the landforms. Microrelief based on a manual interpolation of contour lines with spacing of 0. 5 m from the “Carta Tecnica Regionale del Veneto” at scale 1 : 5000 has been used to develop a digital elevation model. Cross sections down to the depth of 5 - 8. 5 m have been carried out with the Edelman hand auger in order to define the stratigraphy of the palaeochannel deposits. Characterization of the sediments sampled in the boreholes used several methods. Loss on ignition (LOI) gave organic versus carbonate mineral content ratio, palaeobotanical analyses established the vegetation assemblage of the swamp environment, radiocarbon dating dated the peat layers and petrographical analysis determined the composition of the sands in order to relate with the appropriate fluvial basin, either Adige or Po. The cross sections are very close to archaeological sites and locate in Sarzano (Rovigo), Saline and Chiaroni (San Martino di Venezze, Rovigo), Ca’ Motte (Villadose, Rovigo) and Conetta (Cona, Venezia). Exemplary is the case of Saline and Chiaroni: the first site {{is directly related to the}} palaeochannel and cross-sections show that the archaeological site lies on the western side of the main sand body of the alluvial ridge, contrary to the <b>remote</b> sensing <b>indications.</b> The transect in the second site area suggests the presence of a bifurcation of the palaeochannel, just upstream it is covered by the modern Adige alluvial ridge, in agreement with the digital elevation model. Furthermore the transect across major crevasse splay deposit, as recognized by remote sensing on the right side of the palaeochannel and located between Rovigo and modern Adige River, allowed to reconstruct the geometry of the deposits and to clarify the relationship between its sands and the northernmost Po distributary channel activity...|$|R
40|$|In {{keeping with}} global {{liberalisation}} trends and impelled by external liberalisation {{in terms of}} eroding preferential treatment in their principal export markets, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) 1 together with the wider Caribbean Common Market (CARICOM) region, has since 1993 embraced a policy of trade liberalisation as a strategy for growth and development. In large measure this was done through the phased implementation of a Common External Tariff (CET) involving a progressive lowering of tariff rates over the period, 1993 - 1998. The theoretical arguments {{in support of this}} policy change are based on the assumption of a positive link between trade liberalisation and economic growth. They contend that trade reforms that increase the outward-orientation/openness of trade regimes would result in structural change that reallocate resources in line with comparative advantage leading to exportled growth. This will then be followed by faster economic growth as countries benefit from efficiency gains, technology spillovers and other positive externalities. The thesis empirically assesses these claims against the nature of the impact of trade liberalisation on: (i) the export structure of the OECS and (ii) its economic growth performance. Using a comparative analysis in a dichotomous framework of ten-years before and after the policy reforms we find that in general the predictions of the underlying neo-classical trade model are not supported by the empirical evidence. There were indications of structural changes in exports in terms of reduced specialisation and competitiveness of traditional sectors and a steady shift of the macro-economy away from commodity production both agriculture and manufacturing towards services. Meanwhile the evidence suggests a revenue-neutral fiscal impact and no indication of systematic increase in technology transfer over the post-reform period.
