50|$|The {{privilege}} <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>writs,</b> {{in medieval}} England, was a right given to certain liberties or franchises to execute royal writs within {{the land in}} question. This in effect meant overpassing the authority normally held by the sheriff as the king's representative in the localities. Examples of such liberties in medieval England include the palatine counties (see county palatine) County Durham, Cheshire and the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|R

The bailiff was to hold the offices of escheator, coroner and clerk {{of the market and}} to act as a justice of the peace within the borough.

5|$|William and Catherine had six children, {{most of whom}} made highly {{fortunate}} matches {{with other}} members of the nobility. The first Earl of Salisbury made enormous additions to the family fortune; at the time of his father's death, the lands had been valued at just over £300. In 1344, only the annual income of the lands has been estimated to more than £2,300, equivalent to about £ in present-day terms. Edward was also free with granting franchises to Salisbury, including the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>writs,</b> which gave the earl authority in his lands normally held by the royally appointed sheriff. Salisbury's oldest son William succeeded his father in July 1349, while still a minor, as William Montagu, 2nd Earl of Salisbury. The younger William was one of the founding members of the Order of the Garter, but he never enjoyed the same favour with the king as his father had.|$|R
5000|$|Nulla bona is a Latin {{legal term}} meaning [...] "no goods" [...] - a sheriff writes {{this when he}} can find no {{property}} to seize to pay off a court judgment.

25|$|This unusual winter general {{election}} {{was caused by}} a motion of no confidence passed by the House of Commons on November 28, 2005, with Canada's three opposition parties contending that the Liberal government of Prime Minister Paul Martin was corrupt. The following morning Martin met with Governor General Michaëlle Jean, who then dissolved parliament, summoned the next parliament, and ordered the issuance <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> election. The last set January 23, 2006, as election day and February 13 as the date for <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs.</b> The campaign was almost eight weeks in length, the longest in two decades, in order to allow time for the Christmas and New Year holidays.|$|R
50|$|Although, under Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, each {{parliament}} has {{a maximum}} term {{of five years}} after the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> <b>of</b> the last election, on November 6, 2006, the Parliament of Canada passed Bill C-16, An Act to Amend the Canada Elections Act. It requires that each general election is to take place on the third Monday in October in the fourth calendar year after the previous poll, starting with October 19, 2009.|$|R
25|$|As {{elections}} have fixed four-year terms, the election date of 18 March 2006 was known {{well ahead of}} time. The Electoral Act stipulates that the election is to be held on the third Saturday in March every four years. The election campaign must run {{for a minimum of}} 25 days or a maximum of 55 days, therefore the Governor would have needed to issue writs for the election by 21 February 2006 at the latest. On 20 February, Premier Mike Rann invited Governor Marjorie Jackson-Nelson to issue writs for the election. In accordance with electoral regulations, the Electoral Commissioner then advertised key dates for the election of the House of Assembly and half of the Legislative Council – close of rolls on 27 February 2006 at noon, nominations to be received by 2 March 2006 at noon, polling day on 18 March 2006, and the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> on or before 28 April 2006.|$|R
5000|$|Under section 17 of the Constitution Act 1986, Parliament expires {{three years}} [...] "from the day fixed for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> issued {{for the last}} {{preceding}} general election {{of members of the}} House of Representatives, and no longer." [...] The writs for the 2011 election are returnable on 15 December 2011. [...] As a result, the 50th Parliament will expire, if not dissolved earlier, on Monday, 15 December 2014.|$|R
5000|$|A {{governor}} general's warrant is {{a document}} authorizing Canada's President of the Treasury Board {{to spend money}} appropriated by Parliament. The Governor General may also issue a special warrant which allows the government to spend funds without an appropriation from Parliament. A special warrant may only be issued when money is [...] "urgently needed" [...] after Parliament has been dissolved and until sixty days after the dates set for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> election <b>writs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Constitution Act 1986 {{defines the}} term of Parliament as [...] "three years from the day fixed for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> issued for the last {{preceding}} general election {{of members of the}} House of Representatives, and no longer". Since the writs for the 2005 election were returned on 6 October 2005,the ensuing 48th New Zealand Parliament expired on 6 October 2008, making 15 November the final possible date for the 2008 general election.|$|R
50|$|In Queensland, a {{parliamentary}} term is {{a maximum of}} three years, measured from the day set for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the electoral <b>writs.</b> The previous state election was held on 21 March 2009 to elect the 89 members of the Legislative Assembly.|$|R
25|$|The term of Parliament and {{the timing}} of general {{elections}} is {{set out in the}} Constitution Act 1986 and the Electoral Act 1993. Under section 19 of the Constitution Act, Parliament must meet within six weeks <b>of</b> the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> for a general election, while under section 17, the term of Parliament ends three years after the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs,</b> unless Parliament is dissolved earlier by the Governor-General. Section 125 of the Electoral Act requires that whenever Parliament expires or is dissolved, the Governor-General must issue a <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> election within seven days. Section 139 of the Electoral Act provides further constraints. The writ must be returned within 50 days of being issued, though the Governor-General may appoint an earlier return date in the writ itself. Furthermore, polling day must be between 20 and 27 days after the close of nominations. Thus, New Zealand law requires elections at least once every three years and two months, though elections are often held after three years, traditionally in November. The extra two months allow for some flexibility when returning to a fourth-quarter election after an early election, as happened in 2005 and 2008 after the 2002 snap election (see below).|$|R
25|$|Historically, the Prime Minister {{could ask}} the Governor General {{to call an}} {{election}} at virtually any time, although one had to be called no later than {{five years after the}} <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> under section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. In 2007, the Conservative Parliament passed an act requiring fixed election dates in Canada every four years. This law does not curtail the power of the Governor General to dissolve Parliament at any time, as was done for the 2008 election at the request of Prime Minister Stephen Harper.|$|R
5000|$|The 39th Yukon general {{election}} will return {{members to the}} 35th Yukon Legislative Assembly. There is no fixed election date law in Yukon, so the maximum length that a legislature may sit is determined by Section 4 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms: [...] "no legislative assembly shall continue for longer than five years from the date fixed for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> at a {{general election}} of its members". The writs for the previous general election were returned November 14, 2016, making an election probable for 2021.|$|R
5000|$|The Lord Warden was solely {{responsible}} for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> all <b>writs</b> to the Crown, along with the collection of taxes and the arrest of criminals. His court was held in St James's church, near Dover Castle, and there he exercised jurisdiction broadly equivalent to that of Chancery. He also had a [...] "lieutenant's powers of muster", and the Constableship of Dover Castle, later added (1267) to the Warden's office, enabled him to keep a garrison and administrative staff, including the Clerk and the Lieutenant of the Castle.|$|R
50|$|No Assembly may {{continue}} {{for longer than}} five years and forty days after the issuing <b>of</b> <b>writs</b> for the previous election on April 30, 2017 or for longer than five years from the date fixed for the <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the <b>writs</b> for the previous election (normally 10 days following the election, which was on May 30, 2017). Upon the expiration of the Assembly on June 9, 2022, the Lieutenant Governor {{is not required to}} immediately call an election, but Section 8 of the House of Assembly Act requires the House to sit at least once between January 1 and June 30 and at least once between September 1 and December 31, unless there has been an election in the preceding six months. The election must be held on a Tuesday at least 30 days and not more than 46 days after the date the <b>writ</b> <b>of</b> election is issued.|$|R
