2500|$|As well as {{the close}} {{tolerances}} between parts, the engine's lack of gaskets {{was made possible by}} a unique crankcase ventilation system. On any 2-cylinder boxer engine such as the 2CV's, the volume of the crankcase reduces by the cubic capacity of the engine when the pistons move together. This, combined with the inevitable small amount of [...] "leakage" [...] of combustion gases past the pistons leads to a positive pressure in the crankcase which must be removed in the interests of engine efficiency and to prevent oil and gas leaks. The 2CV's engine has a combined engine [...] "breather" [...] and oil filler assembly which contains a series of rubber <b>reed</b> <b>valves.</b> These allow positive pressure to escape the crankcase (to the engine air intake to be recirculated) but close when the pressure in the crankcase drops as the pistons move apart. Because gases are expelled but not admitted this creates a slight vacuum in the crankcase so that any weak joint or failed seal causes air to be sucked in rather than allowing oil to leak out.|$|E

50|$|Composite {{materials}} are preferred in racing engines, especially in kart racing, because the stiffness of the petals {{can be easily}} tuned and they are relatively safe in failure. High-speed impact takes its toll on all <b>reed</b> <b>valves,</b> with metal valves suffering in fatigue. The physical inertia of <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> means {{that they are not}} as entirely precise in action as rotary valves, a rotary valve engine may run better than a reed valve engine at a small rpm range but the reed valve engine often runs better over a wider rpm range. More sophisticated designs partly address this by creating multi-stage reeds with smaller, more responsive reeds within larger ones that provide more volume later in the cycle. Nevertheless, current technology favors <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> almost to the exclusion of rotary valves due to their simplicity and low implementation costs and less rotational mass.|$|E
5000|$|...Their {{application}} {{is restricted to}} smaller compressors where efficiency and uptime are not critical. In 2009, the Modular Reed Valve (MRV) technology was developed for compressors. The MRV has a flow path similar to <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> used in two-stroke engines, but with design elements to handle the higher differential pressures seen in typical compressor applications. MRVs are drop in replacement <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> for industrial reciprocating compressors, for speeds from 350 rpm to over 3600 rpm, pressure differential to 3500 psi (241 bar) across a valve, continuous application temperatures from -40 to 550 F (-40 C to 288 C), and for most gases including highly corrosive gases such as sour gas, ammonia, chlorine and acid gas [...] Modular <b>Reed</b> <b>Valves</b> have been deployed for larger compressors in critical applications. Valves based on the MRV design such as the Straightflo valve, have been deployed in natural gas gathering, gas transmission, CO2 and gas injection, propane, air and CO2 applications. MRV has also been used in research involving repurposing automobile engines for compressed natural gas.|$|E

Linked Yamaha YPVS exhaust power valves are {{controlled}} by a single electronic unit and servo motor and are designed to give a broader power band. The engine also features intake <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> unlike the YZR500 racer which used rotary disc valve induction. The <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> use two different intake arrangements, the lower cylinders are fed through crankcase mounted reeds; the upper pair use cylinder barrel mounted reeds. The four Mikuni carburettors are side mounted in pairs and feed each cylinder through 90 degree intake manifold.The lower expansion chambers exit normally but the upper pipes cross over each other just behind the exhaust ports to maintain the correct tuned length.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> are {{commonly}} used in high-performance versions of the two-stroke engine, where they control the fuel-air mixture admitted to the cylinder. As the piston rises in the cylinder a vacuum is created in the crankcase beneath the piston. The resulting pressure differential opens the valve and the fuel-air mixture flows into the crankcase. As the piston descends, it raises the crankcase pressure causing the valve to close to retain the mixture and pressurize it for its eventual transfer through to the combustion chamber. The Swedish motorcycle company Husqvarna produced a two-stroke, 500 cc displacement single cylinder engine with a reed-valve controlled intake, {{one of the biggest}} in using this arrangement. <b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> in two-stroke engines have been placed in the intake ports and also in controlling the intake to the crankshaft space.|$|E

50|$|<b>Reed</b> <b>valves</b> are {{designed}} considering the pressure gradient and mass flow. The pressure gradient {{is used to}} evaluate the valve lift during open condition; the lift and overall component geometry (considering also a pressure loss coefficient) are then used to calculate the mass flow. For high speed applications (compressors and engines) the dynamic response has to be considered. A simple approach consists in the evaluation of first eigenvalue that is compared with exciting frequency.Design of <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> can be refined using simulations. The dynamic of petals can be studied neglecting the coupling between fluid and structure: in this case the evolution of the structural part are simulated using lumped parameters models or FEM models, discharge coefficients at various valve lift are evaluated with experiments or CFD simulations.The study of the complete system needs an integrated Fluid-structure interaction model.|$|E
50|$|Yanmar Diesel, a Japanese engine maker, was {{pioneer in}} {{introducing}} <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> for flow control at intake ports of its small Wankel engines, showing {{an improvement in}} torque and performances at low rpm and under partial load of the engine. Toyota discovered the benefits of injecting fresh air into the Wankel RCE exhaust port, and also used a reed valve in prototypes where they tested the SCRE concept (Stratified Charge Rotary Engine). However, this kind of intake port arrangement never reached the production line for automobile size RCEs. According to David W. Garside, who developed the Norton line of Wankel-powered motorcycles, data from other RCE producers pointed that <b>reed</b> <b>valves</b> do improve performances at low rpm and under partial load, but reduce the high speed power output of the engine, a feature considered inconvenient for motorcycle engines.|$|E
