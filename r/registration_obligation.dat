Protection of geographical indications can only be obtained by registration carried out by local government representatives, community or group of communities in the area. This <b>registration</b> <b>obligation</b> requires a collective approach from the community, the local government, producers or stakeholders {{in the area to}} do the mapping and protection mandated by law. This differs from the regime liabilities indication of origin without the need to be registered but the protection of geographical indications as they should. Protection of indications of origin can be considered as an option for superior product protection in addition to the geographical indication. Protection of geographical indications and indications of origin will give effect to the increase of sales of local products area as guaranteed by law the existence of inherent existence of the specific characteristics of the products produced by an area. The diversity and distinctiveness of an area, either due to natural and human factors requires the responsibility of local governments to provide adequate protection of typical products. This article examines the correlation between superior product with the importance of the protection of geographical indications and indications of origin associated with preparation for the Asean Economic Community. Through the protection of geographical indications and indications of origin, local products are expected to be able to increase the sale value of the product, the welfare of local communities as well as introducing local name.

30|$|According to the {{publicly}} available information on REACH registrations, short-chain PFAAs, e.g., PFBA (perfluorobutanoic acid), PFBS (perfluorobutanesulfonic acid) and PFHxA (perfluorohexanoic acid) have not been registered so far. The last registration deadline under REACH for substances which are manufactured or imported between one and 100 tons per year is 31 May 2018. However, <b>registration</b> <b>obligations</b> do not include substances in imported articles. In contrast to the short-chain PFAAs, various short-chain precursor substances are registered in high tonnages (>  100 tons per annum) and are mainly used for manufacturing polymers. Those polymers may most likely have wide dispersive uses. In general, short-chain PFASs can substitute long-chain PFASs in manifold applications [28]. Therefore, they are used comparably to long-chain PFASs in many consumer products and industrial applications requiring inert or repellent characteristics. Due to a partially limited technical performance in comparison with long-chain PFASs, higher amounts of short-chain PFASs are usually used in compensation (e.g., in wax and polish) [28]. During the production and life cycle of the products, inevitably releases of short-chain PFASs into the aquatic and terrestrial environment occur [29]. There are vast amounts of applications, but only scarce information on uses of short-chain PFASs. Additionally, the degradation of side-chain fluorinated polymers might contribute significantly to emissions of short-chain PFASs in the long-term, as demonstrated by an environmental fate modeling analysis by Li et al. [30]. Besides degradation of the polymers in the long-term, non-bound residues can easily reach the environment and may thus contribute to future releases [29, 30]. Due {{to the hundreds of}} various precursors, assessing the uses of all precursors is nearly impossible. The Swedish Chemicals Agency [4], the Norwegian Environment Agency [31] and the Danish Ministry of the Environment [32] provided detailed information on the use of short-chain PFASs to the extent possible. In the following, information for some use areas is summarized.|$|R

40|$|International {{audience}} This {{article focuses}} on the possible implications of the McFadden decision by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the development and sustainability of community networks (CNs). CNs provide internet connectivity through open wi-fi, normally based on distributed infrastructure and wireless technologies, that enable users to create an open, community owned and run, network. CNs constitute a grassroots alternative to commercial internet service providers (ISPs) : as infrastructure commons, they {{have the potential to}} be participatory, democratic, and more respectful of communications privacy. The possibility of offering open wi-fi {{is one of the main}} issues at stake in the McFadden case. This article explains how the CJEU decision is likely to affect the fate and the design of CNs. Particular attention is paid to the effect of the decision on the organisational shaping of CNs in Europe and structural changes CNs may have to consider implementing: (a) the donation policy, the fee or absence thereof, as the decision refers to the commercial status of providers; (b) the legal status (network operator, intermediary, internet service provider) and the existence of a legal representative, or the absence thereof in the case of very decentralised CNs; (c) possible warranties and disclaimers contained in the service Terms of Use; (d) the technological decentralised architecture, impacting and impacted by possible password, data retention and <b>registration</b> <b>obligations.</b> After describing what are CNs and how they work (part 2), the article presents the liability challenges for CNs and in particular the hurdles to assign liability (part 3) and the specific situation of the ‘Störerhaftung’, the legal doctrine that provides that a wi-fi operator is responsible for users’ wrongdoings in Germany, the jurisdiction of origin of the McFadden case. The article then analyses in detail the McFadden decision (part 4) and its implications for the organisational shaping of CNs according to selected design features (part 5).

40|$|The Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (hereafter: RIVM) {{recently}} investigated how the bio-based economy, {{more specifically}} the bio-based chemistry sector, {{relates to the}} EU REACH Regulation on chemicals. From this investigation, RIVM learnt that REACH may actually be an opportunity rather than the administrative hurdle that it is often perceived to be. To conduct their analysis, RIVM provided {{an overview of the}} daily practice issues encountered by bio-based companies with respect to their roles and obligations under REACH. The analysis was performed on the bio-based economy-related queries received by the Dutch REACH helpdesk between 2013 and 2015. The issues were grouped and discussed under the REACH process categories that they pertain to, namely: registration, authorisation and restriction. The majority of questions submitted focussed on registration and exemption opportunities. It is well known that smaller companies, in particular, perceive REACH as a hurdle and often do not have enough knowledge about the consequences that this legislation can have on their own business situation. For aspects like the scope and applicability of REACH exemptions, what is most important is that better clarifications are provided which give companies insight into their duties and show what possibilities there are for them to use exemption clauses. The more complex issues, such as those concerning substance identity and resource recovery from waste, require attention from policy makers. Details about the borderlines between waste, which is covered by specific legislation, and the substances and products which fall under the remit of REACH, need to be more clearly elaborated. From a legal and safety perspective it is useful, and understandable, that 'a chemical is a chemical' under the REACH regulation, irrespective of the source feedstock. However, from a practical point of view, it is noted that some registration exemptions may be specifically applicable to bio-based manufacturers. This means that if certain conditions are met, the REACH <b>registration</b> <b>obligations</b> will be less of a burden to some of the bio-based manufacturers. REACH also offers all bio-based manufacturers the opportunity to develop safe bio-based alternatives to substances which are currently of very high concern...|$|R

40|$|Compulsory service {{programmes}} {{have been}} used worldwide {{as a way to}} deploy and retain a professional health workforce within countries. Other names for these programmes include ”obligatory”, ”mandatory”, ”required” and ”requisite. ” All these different programme names refer to a country’s law or policy that governs the mandatory deployment and retention of a heath worker in the underserved and/or rural areas of the country for a certain period of time. This study identified three different types of compulsory service programmes in 70 countries. These programmes are all governed by some type of regulation, ranging from a parliamentary law to a policy within the ministry of health. Depending on the country, doctors, nurses, midwives and all types of professional allied health workers are required to participate in the programme. Some of the compliance-enforcement measures include withholding full <b>registration</b> until <b>obligations</b> are completed, withholding degree and salary, or imposing large fines. This paper aims to explain these programmes more clearly, to identify countries that have or had such programmes, to develop a typology for the different kinds and to discuss the programmes in the light of important issues that are related to policy concepts and implementation. As governments consider the cost of investment in health professionals’ education, the loss of health professionals to emigration and the lack of health workers in many geographic areas, they are using compulsory service requirements as a way to deploy and retain the health workforce...|$|R
30|$|In {{the context}} of this approach, {{there is a need for}} clear {{criteria}} to avoid a split-up in many substances with small tonnages below the REACH triggers for registration requirements due to the variability of nanomaterials. The argument of the CARACAL paper based on the guidance for data sharing is ‘whether or not data sharing would give a meaningful result’[39]. Some stakeholders are in favour of considering nanomaterials as substances on their own. If even the different nanoforms of a substance were treated as different substances, such an approach would need very low tonnage triggers for the <b>registration</b> and data <b>obligations</b> in REACH. A proposal from KemI gives an impression of some of the necessary changes[40]. KemI proposes to regulate nanomaterials by an individual regulation, which supports the existing REACH regulation. Nanomaterials shall be considered as substances of its own with a registration starting from 10  kg/a. However, the KemI proposal does not include an approach how to differentiate between different nanomaterials of the same chemical composition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first week}} of {{fixtures}} on 5 October 1985 included a game in Zagreb at Dom Sportova's small hall between Cibona and visiting Smelt Olimpija — a contest that would {{go down in history}} for Dražen Petrović's Yugoslav Basketball League single-game scoring record as well as the strange circumstance that allowed it to happen. Since the visiting team failed to fulfill their player <b>registration</b> administrative <b>obligations</b> in time (Olimpija general manager Radovan Lorbek was reportedly late with sending a registration letter to the Yugoslav Basketball Federation (KSJ) headquarters in Belgrade), it rendered their entire first team roster ineligible for the regular season opening game. They thus had to field players from their youth system. Sending out juniors (age 18 and under) would've been the first option; however, since Olimpija had no junior team within their youth system that year, they had to make do with cadets (16 and under). In the end, the team they took to Zagreb consisted of players born in 1968 and younger, including Igor Đurović, Matjaž Strmole, Jože Maček, Dag Kralj, Tine Erjavec, Jure Zorčič, Gregor Stražiščar, Andrej Novina, and Tine Merzelj. Cibona for their part decided to send out a mixed roster consisting of players from their youth system plus their 21-year-old superstar Dražen Petrović who used the opportunity of playing against inferior opposition to shatter Radivoj Korać's single-game Yugoslav League scoring record from 1962 when Korać scored 74 points for OKK Beograd versus Mladost Zagreb. In a 158-77 blowout in front of 2,000 people against the hapless Ljubljana team, Petrović scored 112 points on 40 for 60 field goal shooting that included 10 for 20 three-point shooting. He did so despite reportedly announcing his intention of leaving the floor once he reached Korać's 74 points. Petrović was one of only five Cibona players to get on the score sheet that day, the other four were eighteen-year-old Dražen Anzulović with 16 points, eighteen-year-old Vladimir Rizman with 14, nineteen-year-old Ivo Nakić with 12, and Ivan Šoštarec with 4.|$|R
40|$|Until {{the global}} {{financial}} crisis in 2008, hedge funds had relied on various safe harbor rules to remain unregulated. Since then, various subprime mortgage crisis-driven regulatory reforms have been made worldwide. Through the implementation of <b>registration</b> and reporting <b>obligations</b> the hedge fund regulatory framework has been changed to reinforce regulations that may provide financial stability, making hedge funds more like other regulated entities. Current hedge fund regulations {{are based on the}} policy grounds, on one hand, that macro-prudential regulations are necessary due to the potential adverse effects on the market from hedge fund size and leverage positions, and on the other hand, that conventional micro-prudential regulations are necessary due to the rising exposure of unaccredited and unsophisticated investors to the market (necessitating governmental protection). Based on observations of the hedge fund regimes in the U. S., the U. K., and Korea, this article concludes that the current regimes have succumbed to the pressure to overregulate: It would be prudent for future regulatory efforts to focus on making the hedge fund market accessible to only accredited investors, and the role of a visible regulatory hand in this market should be refrained from to the extent necessary to promote market competition and financial innovation, while mitigating potential systemic risk from hedge fund failures...|$|R

40|$|Sects as a Threat Sects {{are both}} {{a social and}} {{religious}} phenomenon in contemporary society. We often hear about religiously motivated violence. Therefore, the phrase Sects as a threat {{is not a very}} suprising term. Often, there appears a situation in which sects threaten not only their members but also the whole society. Based on that, it is important to characterize them and determine where religiously motivated violence or extremism could be seen. In the introduction of the theoretical work I mention the basic terminology, explain the nature of religion and differentiate the basic religious faiths. Next, the new religious movements follow. Related to that is the legislation of churches and religious societies, their <b>registration,</b> rights, <b>obligations</b> and the like. Followingly, the religious movements which could represent a potential threat or raised public awareness by their controversial affairs are described. Despite the fact that Jehovah's Witnesses are a registered church, the thesis includes also them. I have mentioned them because the majority of respondents believe that they actually are a sect. A similar situation is with Satanism. Even they have church associations. At the same time, there sometimes happen situations, when extremist groups refer to satanism, for example after an act of violence. This phenomenon appears in far more religious movements. The next step is to sketch the negative influences of new religious movements on both an individual and society as a whole. After that the term Sect is described in detail. This part contains information on the features of particular sects, psychical manipulation methods and the ways of recruiting new members. Nevertheless, even the characteristics of sect leaders is included. What we cannot forget is the prevention of affecting of these dangerous groups and also help for the sect members who want to escape them. In {{the last part of the}} theoretical work I concentrate on The Czech Republic as a state. I describe the attitude of the state to churches and religious societies. Next, I aim at the religion policy of the state and how different govermental and nongovermental organizations participate in the problem. The thesis also deals with the rate of participation of different governmental offices, such as Home office and Culture office and also with the rate of participation of Police. The main goal of the thesis is the evaluation of the activity and threats of religious groups active both in the area of The Czech Republic and foreign countries as well. I have also dealt with a statistic qantitative research strategy using the questionaire research in both non-professional and professional public. The questions were asked in the areas possibly threatened by sects and mainly concerned the security risks of The Czech Republic related to the activities of sects. Next, the statistic evaluation of differences between non-professional and professional public awareness of the issue followed. The thesis also dealt with the analysis of available literature sources on the issue of sects. The result of the research shows a considerable difference between non-professional and professional public awareness. The thesis could be possibly used as a summary of possible risks originating in sects and can also serve as a source of information of the problem of religious groups...|$|R
