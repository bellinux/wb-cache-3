50|$|A popular method {{discussed}} {{extensively on}} the brighthand.com and spug.net for modification have involved opening the case and removing the original 900mAh battery and <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> with various higher-capacity batteries, or simply <b>replacing</b> <b>it</b> because of age (a replacement battery costs {{a small fraction of}} the manufacturer's battery-replacement charge).|$|R

5|$|By 1953, the {{lighthouse}} was in poor {{condition and the}} U.S. Coast Guard opted to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a skeleton tower. The lighthouse was sold to the Fairfield Dock Company, which initially planned to move it ashore, but it was later decided to dismantle and scrap it. A plan existed to move {{the lighthouse}} ashore to a city park as a monument to Connecticut's maritime heritage, but the location could not be agreed upon.|$|E
5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should <b>replace</b> <b>it,</b> his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx also never clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{cast and}} production changes over the years, Last of the Summer Wine {{continued to be}} popular with viewers and was renewed year after year despite reports to the contrary. Rumours circulated {{as early as the}} 1980s that the BBC wanted to end the show and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a new programme aimed at a younger audience. Its popularity made this decision hard to justify, however, since even repeats sometimes received ratings of as many as five million viewers per episode.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, the University of Dayton {{released}} a Master Plan {{which called for}} the renovation and construction of several houses, an extension to Stonemill Road to connect directly to Evanston Avenue, and the enlargement and clean-up of the parking areas in the alleys behind the houses. Despite ongoing rumors, there were no plans to raze the Ghetto and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with more high-density housing and other university buildings, despite the landlocked nature of the campus.|$|E
5|$|Over {{four years}} after Cold Feet ended, ITV {{executives}} were {{still looking for a}} series that could comfortably <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> On his appointment as chairman of ITV plc in 2007, Michael Grade announced that he wanted the ITV network to be broadcasting long-running series like Cold Feet to attract the younger, upmarket viewing demographic.|$|E

5|$|The first {{structure}} {{in what is}} now Sheerness was a fort built by order of Henry VIII to prevent enemy ships from entering the River Medway and attacking the naval dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work began to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed during the 1667 Dutch raid on the Medway. The Secretary of the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, subsequently ordered the construction of Sheerness Dockyard as an extension to that at Chatham.|$|E

5|$|A second {{attempt to}} gain the {{agreement}} of Militia colonels to the proposed amalgamation was made in late June, and was strongly opposed. All fourteen of the Militia representatives insisted that overseas service should be done by complete Militia battalions, rather than drafts sent to regular battalions. A third meeting, in October, proposed that the Militia join with the Volunteers as the senior element of the Territorial Force; this, too, was rejected. As both possible approaches {{for dealing with the}} Militia had been strongly opposed, the decision was taken to do away with it entirely and <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a newly created force, the Special Reserve, which would incorporate those elements of the Militia willing to be transferred.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the Russian Civil War {{the victorious}} Bolsheviks {{considered}} finishing Izmail, and possibly Borodino, to their original design. It would have taken at least two years to build all of Izmails turrets, even if enough guns had been available. Ten had been delivered by Vickers before the Revolution and one gun had been completed domestically in 1912, but the prospects that more guns could be purchased from Vickers or that the Soviets could make more were not promising, given the state of their heavy industry {{in the wake of the}} Civil War. Another problem was the complicated electrical system; it could not be completed under current conditions, and at least twenty months would be required to <b>replace</b> <b>it</b> with a simpler system.|$|E
5|$|Amon's reign was in {{the midst}} of a {{transitional}} time for the Levant and the entire Mesopotamian region. To the east of Judah, the Assyrian Empire was beginning to disintegrate while the Babylonian Empire had not yet risen to <b>replace</b> <b>it.</b> To the west, Egypt was still recovering under Psamtik I from its Assyrian occupation, transforming from a vassal state to an autonomous ally. In this power vacuum, many smaller states such as Judah were able to govern themselves without foreign intervention from larger empires.|$|E
