5|$|Several of Bonds's {{family and}} {{extended}} {{family members have}} been involved in athletics as either a career or a notable pastime. Bonds has a younger brother, Bobby, Jr., who was also a professional baseball player. His paternal aunt, Rosie Bonds, is a former American record holder in the 80 meter hurdles, and competed in the 1964 Olympics. In addition, he is a distant cousin of Hall of Famer <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson.</b>|$|E
5|$|Three Athletics' first-round picks {{have won}} {{championship}}s with the franchise. <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> (1966) won World Series titles {{with the team}} in 1972, 1973, and 1974. Mark McGwire (1984) and Walt Weiss (1985) won with the 1989 championship team. Four A's first-round picks {{have gone on to}} win the Rookie of the Year Award: McGwire in 1987, Weiss in 1988, Ben Grieve (1994) in 1998, and Huston Street (2004) in 2005. Jackson also won a Most Valuable Player award in 1973, and Barry Zito (1999) won a Cy Young Award in 2002, making them the A's only picks to win these awards. <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> elected in 1993, is their only pick in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Although eligible McGwire has not been elected despite over 500 career home runs and briefly holding the single-season home run record (70). Some see McGwire's exclusion as a sign that the Hall is hesitant to elect players suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs as McGwire was suspected of steroid use (he later admitted his use in 2010). The Athletics have made eighteen selections in the supplemental round of the draft and have made the first overall selection once: in the first draft in 1965.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds. The 10–1 Yankees victory was played {{in front of a}} standing-room only crowd of 17,318spectators. Some Yankees present at the game included owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Bucky Dent, Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Yankees returned for another game against the Sounds on April 28, 1983. Former Sound Don Mattingly, as well as Yankees manager Billy Martin and pitcher Goose Gossage were in attendance. The Sounds, who trailed the Yankees, 4–0, going {{into the bottom of the}} ninth inning, scored five runs to beat the Yankees, 5–4, before a crowd of 13,641.|$|E

50|$|Bonds was {{remarkable}} during his era for his combination {{of power and}} speed, but also for his propensity to strike out. In his first full season in , he set a major league record with 187 strikeouts, while also leading the NL in runs. He broke his own strikeout record a year later with 189. That record lasted until , when Adam Dunn broke it by striking out 195 times. This mark now belongs to Mark Reynolds with 223 in 2009. Bonds 1970 total currently ranks tenth on the all-time single-season strikeout list. When Bonds retired, he ranked third in career strikeouts with 1,757, behind Willie Stargells 1,912 and <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jacksons</b> 1,810. Bobby Bonds hit 39 home runs and had 43 stolen bases in 1973 - {{the highest level of}} home runs and stolen bases (39+ of each) until José Canseco of the Oakland Athletics in 1988. Barry and Bobby had 1094 combined home runs through 2007 - a record for a father-son combination. He was a three-time Gold Glove Award winner (1971, 1973-74), and a three-time All-Star (1971, 1973 & 1975, winning the All-Star MVP award in 1973).|$|R
5|$|On June 17, Thome {{became the}} fourth major league player to hit 100 home runs with three {{different}} teams, joining <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Darrell Evans and Rodriguez. Six days later, Thome hit a pinch-hit walk-off {{home run in the}} ninth inning off of Jake McGee to beat the Tampa Bay Rays, 7–6. This was Thome's 609th home run, tying Sammy Sosa for seventh all-time in home runs while also setting the new record for most walk-off home runs (13) in the modern era. Thome's last game as a Phillie was an afternoon loss to the Miami Marlins on June 30. After the game (which coincided with Howard's return from the disabled list), the team announced that Thome had been traded to Baltimore to serve as their designated hitter.|$|E
5|$|On September 8 Braun, the Brewers' career {{home run}} leader, hit his 300th career home run. With {{the home run}} he became the 6th {{baseball}} player {{to have at least}} 300 home runs and 180 stolen bases in his first 11 big league seasons, joining Willie Mays (368 HRs, 240 SB), <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> (313 HRs, 188 SB), Barry Bonds (334 HRs, 380 SB), Sammy Sosa (336 HRs, 224 SB), and Alex Rodriguez (381 HRs, 205 SB). After the 2017 season, Braun was also ranked first on the Brewers' all-time list in slugging percentage (.540), second in RBIs (989), and third in runs scored (937), doubles (345), triples (45), and stolen bases (193). Through 2017, he was sixth among all active ballplayers in career slugging percentage.|$|E
5|$|The Red Sox signed Mike Torrez, who won {{two games}} in the 1977 World Series for the Yankees, {{as a free agent}} during the offseason. Before the season, the Red Sox {{acquired}} Dennis Eckersley to join Torrez, Bill Lee, and Luis Tiant in their starting rotation. The Yankees acquired Goose Gossage and Rawly Eastwick to join Sparky Lyle, 1977's AL Cy Young Award winner, in their bullpen during the offseason. Both teams placed five players on the AL squad for the 1978 Major League Baseball All-Star Game: Gossage, Ron Guidry, Graig Nettles, Thurman Munson, and <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> represented the Yankees, while Carl Yastrzemski, Fred Lynn, Rick Burleson, Carlton Fisk, and Jim Rice represented the Red Sox.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Reggie</b> Jackson: <b>Jackson</b> {{chose to}} be {{depicted}} with a Yankees cap over an Athletics cap. As {{a member of the}} Kansas City/Oakland A's, Jackson played ten seasons (1967–75, '87), winning three World Series (1972, 1973, 1974) and the 1973 AL MVP Award. During his five years in New York (1977–81), Jackson won two World Series (1977–78), with his crowning achievement occurring during Game Six of the 1977 World Series, when he hit three home runs on consecutive pitches and earned his nickname [...] "Mr. October".|$|R
50|$|Jackson {{had a good}} preseason performance, which {{included}} a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown against the New England Patriots in week 3. After the Eagles' roster was cut to its maximum 53-man limit for the season, he was listed as the starting punt returner and as a second-string wide receiver.Due to injuries sustained by Kevin Curtis and <b>Reggie</b> Brown, <b>Jackson</b> was the first rookie to start opening day for head coach Andy Reid. On September 7, Jackson collected six catches for 106 yards in a 38-3 win over the St. Louis Rams. He also returned eight punts {{for a total of}} 97 yards, including a 60-yard punt return to set up a field goal. He had over 200 all-purpose yards, a record for a rookie wide receiver. During a Monday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys on September 15, Jackson celebrated prematurely before running into the end zone by flipping the football behind him at the one-yard line. This led to what would have otherwise been his first NFL touchdown to be challenged and overturned, with Brian Westbrook running in for a touchdown from the one-yard line on the next play. The Eagles lost the game to Dallas 41-37. Jackson finished the game with 110 yards on six receptions, becoming only the second receiver in NFL history to have over 100 yards receiving in each of his first two games since the Eagles' Don Looney in 1940.|$|R
25|$|In July 2003, Bianca is {{raped by}} Michael. She internalizes her rage and only tells Maggie, but {{eventually}} the entire town of Pine Valley learns the truth, which brings Bianca and her estranged mother closer. Michael is charged with rape but, to the town's outrage, he is acquitted. When Bianca discovers she is pregnant {{as a result of}} rape, Kendall, who had so often scorned Bianca in their past, unconditionally supports her sister and does not give an opinion on Bianca's choices. Michael disappears and Kendall announces she has married her sister's rapist, who shortly turns up dead with Kendall having become the primary suspect in his murder. When Bianca tells Kendall she is keeping her baby, also inspired by Kendall being part of her life, Kendall helps her sister and, with Maggie and Lena's help, aids her in hiding her pregnancy from everyone, including Erica. Kendall announces she is pregnant by Michael, which is also used by her lawyers to help avoid a murder charge and Bianca helps Kendall fake the pregnancy. Bianca and Kendall's ruse is aided by Dr. David Hayward, Ryan Lavery, Lena, Maggie, <b>Reggie</b> Montgomery, and <b>Jackson.</b> The truth eventually comes out that Bianca is the killer but blocked it out and that Kendall, with Reggie's help, worked to cover it up in an effort to protect Bianca; Bianca shot Michael in self-defense but the trauma of her rape led to her repressing the memory. After hearing Bianca's confession, the judge presiding over the case leans hard on the prosecution not to file any charges against her.|$|R
5|$|On June 16, {{he hit the}} 100th {{home run}} of his career, off Red Sox pitcher Jon Lester in a 63 victory. On July 11, he hit his 34th home run of the season, eclipsing his {{previous}} season high in a 31 victory over the Rangers. He earned his 87th and 88th RBIs {{of the season with}} a two-run home run against Mark Buehrle on July 12, setting a new Orioles record for most RBIs before the All-Star break; the previous record was 86 by Boog Powell. He ultimately ended up with 93 RBIs before the All-Star break. On July 14, he hit his 37th home run of the season against Josh Johnson in a 74 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, tying <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> for the second most home runs before the All-Star break by any MLB player and the most by an American League player. The home run was also his 500th career hit.|$|E
5|$|On October 22, in Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols {{became the}} first player to get at least four hits, two home runs, and five RBIs in a World Series game in a 16–7 victory over the Rangers. Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored, and six RBIs in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> as the only players in {{baseball}} history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), {{became the first}} player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBIs in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBIs the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent {{for the first time in}} his career.|$|E
5|$|On April 16, 1981, the New York Yankees made {{a stop in}} Nashville to play an {{exhibition}} game against the Sounds. The 10–1Yankees victory was played {{in front of a}} standing room only crowd of 17,318fans. Also on hand for the game were Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, coach Yogi Berra, and players <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Bucky Dent, Lou Piniella, Bobby Murcer, Goose Gossage, Tommy John, and Johnny Oates. The Sounds won {{the second half of the}} season and went on to win the Western Division championship after defeating the Memphis Chicks in three straight games. The team suffered in the best-of-five league championship series, falling to the Orlando Twins, 3–1. Nashville compiled an 81–62 record during the season under Stump Merrill. Jamie Werly won the Southern League Most Outstanding Pitcher Award after leading the circuit with 18complete games and 193strikeouts. Don Mattingly and Willie McGee, who both played for the Sounds in 1981, were later promoted to the major leagues. In 1985, Mattingly was named the American League Most Valuable Player and McGee named the National League MVP.|$|E
25|$|The Sega Master System {{baseball}} {{video game}} <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> Baseball, endorsed by <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> was sold {{exclusively in the}} United States. Outside of the U.S., it was released as American Baseball.|$|E
25|$|Following the season, Fischer, Goldberg and Press put {{the team}} up for sale, {{and a new}} {{ownership}} group that included <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> and his agent Gary K. Walker bought the Racquets on February 6, 1975, and moved them to Phoenix, Arizona.|$|E
25|$|September 14: In {{front of}} 33,688 fans on a Saturday in Detroit, with Denny McLain seeking his 30th win, <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> {{hit a home}} run in the 4th inning to put the A's on top. Norm Cash responded with a 3-run home run in the 4th. <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> hit his second home run of the day in the 6th inning to put the A's back in the lead. In the bottom of the 9th inning, Al Kaline pinch hit for McLain. Kaline drew a walk and later scored on an error. Willie Horton then drove in Mickey Stanley for the winning run. McLain struck out 10 batters and beat the A's, 5–4, to become the first 30-game winner since Dizzy Dean in 1934.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that during the spare time of his active career, <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> worked as a field {{reporter}} and color commentator for ABC Sports. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations.|$|E
25|$|June 26, 2009 – The {{two teams}} played {{each other for}} the first time at Citi Field. Alex Rodriguez hit his 564th home run, moving past <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> into 11th place on the career home run list. The Yankees defeat the Mets 9–1 after the Mets {{committed}} three errors that led to four runs in the second inning, the most ever against the Yankees.|$|E
25|$|In Game 4 of the 1978 World Series, another {{possible}} case, also uncalled, of offensive interference happened when New York Yankees outfielder <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> on first base, {{stayed in the}} baseline when, after forcing him out at second base, Los Angeles Dodgers shortstop Bill Russell threw to first base to try to complete a double play. Jackson let the ball hit him, but batter Lou Pinella was not called out as Jackson was not charged with interference.|$|E
25|$|The Bronx is {{the home}} of the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball. The {{original}} Yankee Stadium opened in 1923 on 161st Street and River Avenue, a year that saw the Yankees bring home their first of 27 World Series Championships. With the famous facade, the short right field porch and Monument Park, Yankee Stadium has been home to many of baseball's greatest players including Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Whitey Ford, Yogi Berra, Mickey Mantle, <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Thurman Munson, Don Mattingly, Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera.|$|E
25|$|On September 22, 1968, Tovar {{became the}} second player after Bert Campaneris (Kansas City Athletics, 1965) to play all nine fielding {{positions}} in a game. The two were later joined by Scott Sheldon (Texas Rangers, 2000), Shane Halter (Detroit Tigers, 2000), and Andrew Romine (Deroit Tigers, 2017) {{as the only}} five players in MLB history to have accomplished the feat. Tovar started the game on the mound against Oakland and pitched one scoreless inning in which he struck out <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson.</b> As fate would have it, the first batter he faced was Campaneris.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{used his}} {{reputation}} to psyche out the hitters as well. As {{he looked in}} to his catcher for the pitch selection, Perry would touch various parts of his head, such as his eyebrows and his cap. In this manner, he {{may or may not}} have been applying a foreign substance to the ball on any particular pitch. <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> was so upset after striking out against Perry one time that Jackson was ejected from the game. Jackson returned from the dugout with a container of Gatorade, splashing Gatorade onto the field while yelling at the umpire that Perry should be allowed to use the Gatorade on the baseball.|$|E
25|$|The 1984 NLCS {{schedule}} (which had an off {{day after}} Game 3 rather than Game 2) allowed ABC {{to have a}} prime time game each weeknight even though Chicago's Wrigley Field did not have lights at the time (which remained the case until four years later). ABC used Tim McCarver as a field reporter during the 1984 NLCS. During the regular season, McCarver teamed with Don Drysdale (who teamed with Earl Weaver and <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> for the 1984 NLCS) on backup games while Al Michaels, Jim Palmer and Earl Weaver/Howard Cosell formed ABC's number one broadcasting team. For ABC's coverage of the 1984 All-Star Game, Jim Palmer only served as a between innings analyst.|$|E
25|$|The Astros {{defeated}} the Dodgers, four games to three, {{to win their}} first World Series in franchise history, and the first team from Texas to do so. Both teams set a World Series record with a combined total of 25 home runs throughout the entire series, including a team record 15 home runs by the Astros, and hit a combined total of eight home runs in Game 2 to set the single game World Series mark. Houston outfielder George Springer was named as the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after hitting five home runs in the series to tie a World Series record with <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> in 1977 and Dodgers' 2017 World Series representative Chase Utley in 2009 when he played for the Philadelphia Phillies.|$|E
25|$|Allen Craig was {{the hero}} in Game 1 of the World Series, {{singling}} off Alexi Ogando {{to break a}} 2–2 tie. The Cards managed to win. The next day, Craig was almost the hero again when he singled off Ogando {{for the second straight}} night. The Rangers came back to win, 2–1, though, for Jason Motte's only blown save of the postseason. The next game, Albert Pujols went 5-for-6 with three home runs to put him in company with Babe Ruth and <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> as the only players to hit three homers in a World Series game. Pujols also set a record with 14 total bases, hits in four consecutive innings, and tied a Series record with five hits, total bases, RBIs, and runs scored in one game.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Pat Tillman, ASU has had many renowned athletes attend the school. Those athletes include: World Golf Hall of Fame member Phil Mickelson, Baseball Hall of Fame member <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson,</b> Major League Baseball home run king Barry Bonds, National Basketball Association All-Star James Harden, and 2011 NFL Defensive Player of the Year Terrell Suggs. ASU alumni {{enshrined in the}} Pro Football Hall of Fame include: Curley Culp, Mike Haynes, John Henry Johnson, Randall McDaniel, and Charley Taylor. Other notable athletes that attended ASU are: Major League Baseball All-Stars Dustin Pedroia, Sal Bando, and Paul Lo Duca; National Basketball Association All-Stars Lionel Hollins and Fat Lever, and NBA All-Star coach Byron Scott; National Football League Pro Bowl selections Jake Plummer and Danny White, as well as current Houston Texans quarterback Brock Osweiler; and three-time Olympic gold medalist swimmers Melissa Belote and Jan Henne.|$|E
25|$|After {{becoming}} a permanent fixture as the Phillies' second baseman, Utley demonstrated versatility, {{spending some time}} at first base as well. As his fielding has improved over his career, Utley was seen in combination with Jimmy Rollins {{as one of the}} best middle-infield combinations in the NL, until Rollins was traded to the Dodgers in the winter of 2014. Utley was considered by fans to be a team leader of the Phillies, alongside Rollins and Ryan Howard, and he has been noted for his leadership qualities with the Dodgers. Utley was known for his quiet understated demeanor, instead setting an example for teammates with his exhaustive preparation in the video room and the batting cage. Utley's seven career World Series home runs are the most for a second baseman, and he shares the single-series postseason record of five home runs with <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> and George Springer. He is also noteworthy for having participated in seven no-hitters, of which he was on the winning side in four.|$|E
25|$|On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10–4 {{loss to the}} Boston Red Sox in {{a nationally}} {{televised}} game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting {{for the end of}} the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country.|$|E
25|$|On October 28, Utley drew a two-out walk in {{the first}} inning of Game 1 of the 2009 World Series, setting a record for {{reaching}} base in consecutive postseason games (26). Utley hit two home runs in his next two at-bats, the first World Series game played in the new Yankee Stadium. With both home runs coming against left-hander CC Sabathia, Utley joined Babe Ruth as the second left-handed batter to hit two home runs in a World Series game against a left-handed pitcher. On November 1, Utley hit another home run against Sabathia in Game 4, and one day later, Utley hit two home runs in Game 5, giving him a total of five for the series, tying <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> for the most home runs in a World Series. After the season, Utley was named the winner of the National League's Silver Slugger at second base for the fourth consecutive season.|$|E

500|$|The California Angels {{received}} a first-round sandwich pick and the Oakland Athletics' second-round pick {{for the loss}} of type-A free agent <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson.</b> Normally, the Athletics would have to forfeit their first-round pick to the Angels; however, since the Athletics had a top-13 draft choice, the team only had to forfeit their second-round selection.|$|E
500|$|After the Yankees' {{loss to the}} Reds, owner George Steinbrenner {{committed}} to sign marquee free agent <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> to help win a championship. The Yankees, Red Sox, and Baltimore Orioles would keep leap frogging each other the entire year during the division race. The Yankees would win the division {{for the second year}} in a row, while the Orioles and Red Sox finished tied for second, [...] games behind the Yankees. Jackson's entry onto the Yankees initially had caused a lot of friction on them. In the middle game of what would prove to be a three-game series sweep by the Red Sox at Fenway Park, Yankees manager Billy Martin pulled <b>Reggie</b> <b>Jackson</b> off the field in mid-inning for failing to hustle on a ball hit to the outfield. The extremely angry and highly animated Martin had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard from getting into a fistfight with Jackson in the dugout during the nationally televised Saturday afternoon game. Eventually, emotions calmed down for the season and the Yankees came together to recapture the pennant and defeat the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1977 World Series, their first since [...]|$|E
