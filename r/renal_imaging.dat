METHODS: The GFR was determined simultaneously by 3 methods: (a) dual plasma sample clearance method (tGFR); (b) <b>renal</b> dynamic <b>imaging</b> method (dGFR); (c) CDK-EPI equation (eGFR). The tGFR was employed as the reference method. The correlation, regression, and limit of agreement of dGFR and eGFR were used {{to demonstrate the validity}} of the two methods. The comparison of bias, precision, and accuracy between dGFR and eGFR was analyzed to identify the most suitable method. The analysis of bias, precision and accuracy was repeated after stratifying patients by a measured tGFR cutpoint of 60 ml·min(- 1) ·(1. 73 m(2)) (- 1). RESULTS: A total of 149 patients were enrolled. Both dGFR and eGFR correlated well with tGFR and the regression equation of dGFR and eGFR against tGFR was respectively Y = - 4. 289 + 0. 962 X (r =  0. 919; RMSE =  14. 323 ml. min(- 1). (1. 73 m(2)) (- 1); P< 0. 001) and Y =  2. 462 + 0. 914 X (r =  0. 909; RMSE =  15. 123 ml. min(- 1). (1. 73 m(2)) (- 1); P< 0. 001). In addition, Bland-Altman analysis showed preferable agreement between the two methods and the reference method. The comparison revealed that eGFR, compared with dGFR, showed better performance on bias and 50 % accuracy and similar performance on other indexes in the whole cohort and the lower-GFR subgroup, whereas in the higher-GFR subgroup the difference of the two methods was not significant in all parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Although both CDK-EPI equation and <b>renal</b> dynamic <b>imaging</b> can be used to determine the GFR of CKD patients, CDK-EPI equation is more accurate than <b>renal</b> dynamic <b>imaging.</b> As a result, (99 m) Tc-DTPA <b>renal</b> dynamic <b>imaging</b> may be unsuitable to be used as the reference method in investigating the validity of CDK-EPI equation...|$|R

Results are reported for 51 patients: 33 with benign essential hyperten sion and 18 with renovascular hypertension, and for 21 normal controls. All patients underwent renal arteriography. Patients with significant obesity, renal insufficiency, or renoparenchymal disease were excluded from this study. Independent visual anal yses of renal gamma images and time-activity transit curves identified 17 of the 18 patients with renovascular hypertension; one study was equivocal. There were five equivocal and three false-positive results in the essential hypertension and normal control groups. The sensitivity of the method was 94 % and the specificity 85 %. Since the prevalence of the renovascular subset of hypertension is approximately 5 %, the predictive value is only 25 %. Inclusion of computer-generated data did not improve this result. Accordingly, this {{method is not recommended}} as a primary screening test for renovascular hypertension.

Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study from Ontario, Canada. We included all adult TSCI patients injured between 2002 and 2012. The primary outcome was the frequency of urodynamic testing, <b>renal</b> <b>imaging,</b> and cystoscopy. Primary exposure was the year of injury. The impact of age, sex, comorbidity, socioeconomic status, and lesion level was assessed with Cox regression models. Results: One thousand five hundred and fifty one incident TSCI patients were discharged from a rehabilitation hospital. The median follow-up time of this cohort was 5. 0 years (interquartile range = 2. 9 – 7. 5). At least one urodynamics, <b>renal</b> <b>imaging,</b> or cystoscopy was performed during follow-up for 50 %, 80 %, and 48 % of the cohort, respectively. The overall rate of these tests was 0. 22, 0. 60, and 0. 22 per person-year of follow-up. The proportion of patients who had regular, yearly urodynamics (< 2 %), <b>renal</b> <b>imaging</b> (6 %), or cystoscopy (< 2 %) was low. There were no significant linear trends in {{the use of}} these tests over the 10 -year study period. Urodynamics were significantly less likely to be performed in patients over 65 years of age (hazard ratio [HR] = 0. 63, P< 0. 01) and those with a higher level of comorbidity (HR = 0. 72, P< 0. 01). Patients with quadriplegia were significantly less likely to receive any of the investigations compared to those with paraplegia. Conclusion: <b>Renal</b> <b>imaging</b> is done at least once for the majority of patients with TSCI; however, only half undergo urodynamics or cystoscopy. Few patients have regular urologic testing. The reality of urologic testing after TSCI is very different from urologist&# 39;s ideals and practice guidelines.
