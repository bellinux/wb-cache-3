Dungeon Keepers engine was an inspiration for Minecraft.|$|E
5|$|Seventeen months later, Ichigo {{becomes a}} senior in high school. The start of the Lost Agent arc {{describes}} Ichigo's life after he loses his Soul <b>Reaper</b> powers. One day, he meets Kūgo Ginjō, a Fullbringer from the group Xcution. Ginjo offers to replenish Ichigo's Soul <b>Reaper</b> powers in return for helping him and his group to become ordinary humans. With their help, Ichigo unlocks his own Fullbring powers through his Substitute Soul <b>Reaper</b> Badge. However, Ichigo later learns that Ginjo and his ally Shūkurō Tsukishima, a Fullbringer with ability to change people's memories, used him to take Fullbring powers for Xcution's use. Luckily, Rukia transfers the Reiatsu of the Gotei 13's senior officers and other Shinigami through a special sword and restores Ichigo's Soul <b>Reaper</b> powers. Ichigo fights Ginjo with his improved Shinigami powers and during their duel, it is revealed that Ginjo was the first Substitute Soul <b>Reaper.</b> Despite learning the truth, Ichigo resolves to protect everyone (something about him which Rukia notes has never changed) and kill Ginjo, which he does after a prolonged fight.

As the fight between The Authority and the NOTB's prisoners continued, Authority members Jenny Quark and the Doctor learned of the <b>Reapers</b> and had everyone teleported back to the Authority's The Carrier residing in The Bleed just before. However, the <b>Reapers</b> managed to reach to the Carrier by having one of the <b>Reapers</b> turn into a dimensional gateway. A battle ensued between the <b>Reapers,</b> The Authority, and the Paladins in which one of the <b>Reapers</b> breached the Carrier's engine core and released its power source (a miniature universe), potentially destroying the universe. This forced Jenny Quark to shunt the miniature into her body right before kissing the Doctor goodbye. The Doctor teleported the <b>Reapers</b> and Paladins away from the Carrier, preventing further damage to the vessel, but this allowed the <b>Reapers</b> to spread their destruction across the world. Despite the Doctor's best efforts, the Carrier [...] "died" [...] and crashed into London, England.|$|R
5|$|Following {{over fifty}} {{volumes of the}} manga's released, Kubo {{believes}} that Ichigo was the most developed character.

5|$|Bleach {{was first}} {{conceived}} from Tite Kubo's desire {{to draw a}} shinigami in a kimono, which {{formed the basis for}} the design of the Soul Reapers. Because of this, Kuchiki {{was one of the first}} characters of the series to be created. Before deciding that every Soul <b>Reaper</b> had swords, Kubo thought that they all should use guns, while only Rukia used a scythe. However, this was changed as he created the Soul <b>Reaper</b> kimono. Kubo also mentioned that Rukia did not seem like a lead character, so he created Ichigo Kurosaki to be the series protagonist. Ichigo's initial design had black hair like Rukia; Kubo had to modify Ichigo's appearance to contrast with hers, giving Ichigo orange hair and a trademark scowl.|$|E

5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated backwards for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated backwards by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim <b>reaper,</b> and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E

5|$|Grabbed by the Ghoulies is a 3D action-adventure {{game with}} {{platforming}} elements. Breaking with {{the style of}} previous Rare platformers, the gameplay is simple in design, utilising the premise of moving through areas of the game's mansion and completing the required beat 'em up challenges in each room. Such challenges include eliminating all ghouls in a room, beating only a specified kind of ghoul while avoiding eliminating the rest or defeating a boss before the player-character, Cooper, can continue. All combat and melee attacks are manoeuvred by the control sticks, whereas the game's camera can be rotated by both triggers. When the player fails a challenge or takes longer than a set time limit to complete one, the Grim <b>Reaper</b> chases after the player-character; the <b>Reaper</b> will rip out Cooper's soul if the character does not leave the room in time. Standard enemies in the game include zombies, mummies, imps, skeletons and zombie pirates. There are also various bosses that must be defeated in order to advance. Many objects in the game with which the character can interact—including chairs, knives, and axes—can be used as weapons.|$|E
