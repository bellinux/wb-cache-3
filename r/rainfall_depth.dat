This refined the design flood hydrograph method for return periods of up to 1 in 150 years.

In this manner it is possible to represent the natural variability in the runoff coefficient and at the same time to relate <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> to the corresponding flood events. The link with annual maximum <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths,</b> on the one hand, and annual maximum peak discharges on the other, is established through relations deriving from the assumption of Poissonian occurrences over the year.

The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the relationship between the seasonal variations to beach profile changes This study was conducted at Desaru beach, Johor. Desaru beach can be classified as a sandy beach because it consist of fine sand range from 0. 4 to 0. 8 mm. The rainfall data during this two seasons was collected together with the sample of sand and the beach profile of the study area in order to determine the relationship between the <b>rainfall</b> <b>depth</b> during the seasonal variations, the moisture content in the sand and the beach profile changes. The data was collected from May 2014 until February 2015. One rain gauge was installed at the study area to collect the rainfall data. For the beach profiles, the total station was used to do the survey works. The results indicates that during the wet season from November to March, the <b>rainfall</b> <b>depth</b> was higher compared to the dry season from May to August. The seasonal variations is the factor that affect the changes in beach profile.

The aim of studying these dissimilarities is to understand the effects of each approach in modelling and analysis. The qualitative difference is due to the way the two analyses define the accumulated rainfalls for observations which are referred to as <b>rainfall</b> and storm <b>depths,</b> respectively.

The application of the one-parameter algorithm was found to be restricted to low and medium baseflow separations, with a maximum separation limit of 50 % of the total runoff hydrograph. The one-parameter algorithm was also observed to produce unrealistic sharp peaks under the peaks of the measured hydrograph when recession constant is smaller than 0. 96. On the other hand, the conceptual method is applicable even for catchments fed largely by groundwater discharge. However, a reliable estimation of recession constant is a prerequisite for applying the conceptual method for large baseflow separations.

Whenever possible, link networks measure and store the received power of the electromagnetic signal at regular intervals.

Such an alternative technique fulfils the continuous effort to obtain {{measurements of}} rainfall in time and space at higher resolutions, especially in places where traditional rain gauge networks are scarce or poorly maintained. Rainfall maps from microwave link networks have recently been introduced at country-wide scales. Despite their potential in rainfall estimation at high spatiotemporal resolutions, the uncertainties present in rainfall maps from link networks are not yet fully comprehended. The aim of this work is to identify and quantify the sources of uncertainty present in interpolated rainfall maps from link <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths.</b> In order to disentangle these sources of uncertainty, we classified them into two categories: (1) those associated with the individual microwave link measurements, i. e. the errors involved in link rainfall retrievals, such as wet antenna attenuation, sampling interval of measurements, wet/dry period classification, dry weather baseline attenuation, quantization of the received power, drop size distribution (DSD), and multi-path propagation; and (2) those associated with mapping, i. e. the combined effect of the interpolation methodology and the spatial density of link measurements.

May and June recorded high <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> with corresponding isotopic depletion compared to January-April showers in both years (Fig.  4 a). According to Sultan and Janicot (2003), {{during the second half}} of May and in June, the ITCZ remains at a quasi-stable location around 5 °N. Thus, its proximity to Douala explains the high rainfall in May and June. Decreases in <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> and subsequent distinct isotopic enrichments from June to July in 2013 and 2014 (Fig.  4 a) mark the rapid shift in the position of the ITCZ and resultant rainfall peak to a quasi-stable state around 10 °N where it remains until about the end of August (Sultan and Janicot 2000; Thorncroft et al. 2011). The July rainfall reduction and resultant wδ 18 O enrichment in both areas correspond to the typical transition phase of the summer monsoon onset in the region (Sultan and Janicot 2003; Thorncroft et al. 2011). This change is also consistent with a reduction in sea-surface temperatures in the coastal areas (Sultan and Janicot 2003). However, remarkably, the shift in the ITCZ only has a minor effect in Douala compared to Yaounde from July to August as these months still record high <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> suggesting considerable convection activity (Fig.  4 a). The negligible effect may be due to the proximity of Douala to Mount Cameroon where large fractions of convective episodes have their origin on the leeward side (Laing et al. 2011).

40|$|A {{regional}} envelope curve (REC) of flood flows summarises {{the current}} bound on {{our experience of}} extreme floods in a region. RECs are available for most regions of the world. Recent scientific papers introduced a probabilistic interpretation of these curves and formulated an empirical estimator of the recurrence interval T associated with a REC, which, in principle, enables us to use RECs for design purposes in ungauged basins. The main aim of this work is twofold. First, it extends the REC concept to extreme rainstorm events by introducing the Depth-Duration Envelope Curves (DDEC), which are defined as the regional upper bound on all the record <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> at present for various rainfall duration. Second, it adapts the probabilistic interpretation proposed for RECs to DDECs and it assesses the suitability of these curves for estimating the T-year rainfall event associated with a given duration and large T values. Probabilistic DDECs are complementary to regional frequency analysis of rainstorms and their utilization in combination with a suitable rainfall-runoff model can provide useful indications on the magnitude of extreme floods for gauged and ungauged basins. The study focuses on two different national datasets, the peak over threshold (POT) series of <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> with duration 30 min., 1, 3, 9 and 24 hrs. obtained for 700 Austrian raingauges and the Annual Maximum Series (AMS) of <b>rainfall</b> <b>depths</b> with duration spanning from 5 min. to 24 hrs. collected at 220 raingauges located in northern-central Italy.

The historical data used in this study were obtained from 16 yearly records (1988 to 2003) of hourly and daily rainfall taken from the Kamishiiba Observatory in Japan. Following some stationarity assumptions inherent to NSM, it is necessary to obtain parameter sets for each month. Specifically, on a monthly basis, five NSM parameters were obtained by optimizing (by the Levenberg-Marquardt method) an objective function based on historical moments (namely mean, variance, covariance lag 1, etc.) and equivalent NSM moments, which were expressions in terms of the target parameters. By limiting historical information to five moments, the parameter sets obtained for several months (as of this writing) yielded adequate hourly quantiles and poor daily quantiles. Based on the framework of the NSM, {{it may be necessary to}} supply more historical moments (hence more NSM equations in the objective function) so that the five NSM parameters can capture more of the properties of the historical data.
