50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, 2.4 {{gigahertz}} (GHz) transmissions {{have become increasingly}} utilised in high-end control of model vehicles and aircraft. This range of frequencies has many advantages. Because the 2.4 GHz wavelengths are so small (around 10 centimetres), the antennas on the receivers {{do not need to}} exceed 3 to 5 cm. Electromagnetic noise, for example from electric motors, is not 'seen' by 2.4 GHz receivers due to the noise's frequency (which tends to be around 10 to 150 MHz). The transmitter antenna only needs to be 10 to 20 cm long, and receiver power usage is much lower; batteries can therefore last longer. In addition, no crystals or frequency selection is required as the latter is performed automatically by the transmitter. However, the short wavelengths do not diffract as easily as the longer wavelengths of PCM/PPM, so 'line of sight' is required between the transmitting antenna and the receiver. Also, should the receiver lose power, even for a few milliseconds, or get 'swamped' by 2.4 GHz interference, it can take a few seconds for the receiver - which, in the case of 2.4 GHz, is almost invariably a digital device - to <b>re-sync.</b>|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a new time-memory-data trade-off attack which can perform better than existing ones by Biryukov-Shamir (BS-TMD), Hong-Sarkar (HS-TMD) and Dunkelman-Keller (DK-TMD). Current Estream ciphers are resistant to these attacks because the state size is {{too big for the}} BS-TMD attack, while the pre-processing is at least as expensive as exhaustive search for the HS-TMD and DK-TMD attacks. In contrast, our attack can break the Estream finalists: Grain-v 1, Rabbit, Salsa 20, SOSEMANUK and MICKEY with pre-processing and online attack complex-ity faster than exhaustive search. Moreover, our attack can break the AES finalists: Rijndael, Serpent, Twofish, RC 6, MARS in CBC, CFB, OFB and counter modes of opera-tion, with pre-processing and online complexity faster than exhaustive search, while existing TMD attacks cannot. We give an analysis of when our attack works on a generic cipher with IV <b>re-sync,</b> and give recommendations on the choice of IV length for adequate security...|$|E
