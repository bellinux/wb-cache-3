The 2-litre, [...] diesel unit designed and built by Rover for its 4x4 had entered production in 1956 and was one of Britain's first modern high-speed automotive diesel engines.

However, the engine's power output when running on low-grade fuel was too low for the Army's uses. Rover developed a highly advanced (for the time) turbodiesel version of its engine in the mid-1960s to power its experimental '129-inch' heavy duty Land Rover designs. This 2.5-litre engine used a turbocharger built by Rover's gas turbine division as well as an intercooler. This was one of the first times these features had been incorporated on such a small-capacity diesel unit, but they were not adopted.|$|E

After a year of teething troubles with this new design, Veloce entered slightly modified 'K' models into racing events such as the Isle of Man TT and Brooklands races, and the reliability and sweet <b>running</b> <b>qualities</b> of their new engine led to a long string of racing successes, and the introduction of a production racing model, the KTT, built between 1928 and 1949. The 1929 KTT was the first production motorcycle to feature positive-stop, foot-actuated gearchange. [...] The roadster models developed from this initial model K were the Velocette KSS (super sports), KTS (touring sports), KTP (twin exhaust ports), KN (normal), and a few variations. A notable change in engine design was introduced in 1935, the 'KSS Mk2' with a fully enclosed aluminum cylinder head. The OHC engine series continued for roadsters until 1948, when the final KSS Mk.2 versions were produced, with rigid frames and Dowty air-sprung telescopic forks. Accurate valve timing was accomplished through the pioneering use of stroboscopic lamps. The 'K' series showed an excellent turn of speed and reliability and soon the factory developed racing models to compete in the Isle of Man TT.|$|E

The coupled dynamic problem of an in space stationary system, the catenary system, and a system in motion, the pantograph, {{is dependent on the}} behaviour of both combined as well as individually. Different catenary systems exhibit different behaviour. This paper evaluates a catenary system upgrade by dynamic assessment. Existing railway catenary sections are upgraded or replaced due to wear, but also due to an aim for improved <b>running</b> <b>quality</b> or increased speed on the rail line. Field measurements were conducted on an old catenary section. This section was then upgraded, and some months later measurements were conducted on the new catenary section. Thus, field measurements were sampled at the same location twice. Since the measurements were sampled only months apart and that all measurements are recording behaviour under regular train operation, the loading is assumed to be identical. Dynamic assessment of both sections has been done using power spectral densities and histograms. Important differences and similarities in their response can be seen. This study further increases the knowledge regarding the dynamic behaviour of railway catenary sections when evaluating the impact of the upgrades...|$|R

40|$|The {{optical network}} {{system is the}} {{information}} transmission channel {{and one of the}} core functional units of the subsea observatories. The operation quality of the optical network determines whether the subsea observatories could provide valuable data for marine science research directly. With the increasing number of network nodes, an increasing amount of data and transmission rate requirements puts forward severe challenges to the designers of observatories. SDH(Synchronous Digital Hierarchy) is the main means of communication of the existing famous subsea observatories. As we know, SDH, which is based on the optics/electronic/optics transition, is limited by the bottleneck in conversion rate. OTN(Optical Transport Network), which is based on WDM(Wavelength Division Multiplexing), will replace the SDH and become the main technology of next generation backbone transmission network. There are several different parameters which can be used to represent the running states of the optical network.

5000|$|The lack of {{valves and}} the doubled-up working cycle {{also means that}} a {{two-stroke}} hot-bulb engine can run equally well in both directions. A common starting technique for smaller two-stroke engines is to turn the engine over against the normal direction of rotation. The piston will [...] "bounce" [...] off the compression phase with sufficient force to spin the engine the correct way and start it. This bi-directional running was an advantage in marine applications, as the engine could, like the steam engine, drive a vessel forward or in reverse {{without the need for}} a gearbox. The direction could be reversed either by stopping the engine and starting it again in the other direction, or, with sufficient skill and timing {{on the part of the}} operator, slowing the engine until it carried just enough momentum to bounce against its own compression and run the other way. This was an undesirable quality in hot-bulb-powered tractors equipped with gearboxes. At very low engine speeds the engine could reverse itself almost without any change in sound or <b>running</b> <b>quality</b> and without the driver noticing until the tractor drove in the opposite direction to that intended. Lanz Bulldog tractors featured a dial, mechanically driven by the engine, that showed a spinning arrow.
