40|$|The primary {{metabolite}} {{of cocaine}} is benzoyl ecognine (BE). A desirable method for detecting cocaine use is {{the extraction of}} BE from urine into an organic phase solvent and subsequent analysis by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The attempt to develop such a method is hindered by the extreme water solubility of BE, making extraction into an organic phase extremely difficult. The present study attempts to use an ion-pairing agent to bind with BE and form a large, organically soluble ion-pair. The ion pairing agent used was <b>Reinecke</b> <b>Salt</b> in a I% solution. An aqueous solution of 50 ug/mL BE was treated with the <b>Reinecke</b> <b>Salt</b> solution and then extracted with methylene chloride. Initial analysis of the extracted ion pair was performed by Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-VIS) spectrometry. The structure of BE is pH dependent; existing as a positively charged species in acid, a zwitterion in neutral solution, and a negatively charged species in base. The pH dependence of BE results in a pH dependent ion pairing reaction; an ideal pH of 8. 5 was determined for the extraction. A concentration variant peak at 255 nm was discovered using UV-VIS spectrometry, however, the peak does not exhibit linear concentration dependence and so is not currently of practical use...|$|E
40|$|The tetraethylammonium ion (TEA) has {{recently}} been shown to depress transmission in autonomic ganglia (1). The application of this drug in man as a diagnostic and therapeutic agent (2) has made it desirable to determine {{the manner in which}} the drug is eliminated. Tetraethylammonium, in common with choline and other quaternary am-monium ions, possesses the property of forming a water insoluble, acetone soluble complex with <b>Reinecke</b> <b>salt.</b> 2 This reaction has been utilized in the quantitative determination of the drug in urine and in the intestinal contents. METHODS. The analytical method follows in principle the procedure described by Jacobi et al. for the determination of choline (3). Since choline and other interfering nitrogenous compoundsappear in the urine in only small amounts, direct analysis of the urine is possible. In plasma the level of TEA after effective doses probably does not exceed 1 - 2 mgm. %, a concentration too low to permit direct determination with this technique. To a centrifuged sample of urine sufficient to contain between 0. 5 and 7 mgm. of tetra-ethylammomum (calculated as the hydroxide) were added 3 cc. of a 2 % solution of Reineck...|$|E
