In order to get out of the difficulty, Clive himself forged Admiral Watson's signature to the fictitious treaty.|$|E
6000|$|I can see no {{explanation}} of Knox's conduct, {{except that he}} and his friends pacified their consciences by persuading themselves that non-official words of Huntly and Chatelherault (whatever these words may have been), spoken after [...] "all was agreed upon," [...] cancelled the treaty with the Regent, became the <b>real</b> <b>treaty,</b> and were binding on the Regent! Thus Knox or Kirkcaldy, or both, by letter; and Knox later, orally in conversation with Croft, could announce false terms of treaty. So great, if I am right, is a good man's power of self-persuasion! I shall welcome any more creditable theory of the Reformer's behaviour, but I can see no alternative, unless the Lords lied to Knox.|$|E
60|$|Whether {{or not he}} {{threatened}} to divulge the plot to the nabob, unless his demands were satisfied, is doubtful. At any rate, it was considered prudent to pacify him, and he was accordingly told that he should receive the sum he named. Clive, {{and the members of}} the council, however, although willing to gratify their own extortionate greed, at the expense of Meer Jaffier, determined to rob Omichund of his share. In order to do this, two copies of the treaty with Meer Jaffier were drawn up, on different coloured papers. They were exactly alike, except that, in one, the amount to be given to Omichund was entirely omitted. This was the <b>real</b> <b>treaty.</b> The other was intended to be destroyed, after being shown to a friend of Omichund, in order to convince the latter that all was straight and honorable.|$|E
5000|$|There are <b>real</b> <b>treaties</b> and {{personal}} <b>treaties.</b> <b>Real</b> <b>treaties</b> affect the territory itself, such as boundary agreements or the grant of transit rights, which can continuing {{irrespective of the}} personality of the state—the new state must take over the country in the condition in which it finds it, for the parent state cannot give more than it possesses. These treaties can be described as [...] "treaties creating purely local obligations".|$|R
5000|$|Calling the {{agreement}} a [...] "treaty" [...] shows how Parnell managed {{to place a}} spin on {{the agreement}} {{in a way that}} strengthened Irish nationalism, since he had managed to force concessions from the British while in gaol. Since <b>real</b> <b>treaties</b> are usually signed between two states, it led to the idea that Ireland could become independent from Britain. After the 'treaty’ was agreed, those imprisoned with Parnell were then released from gaol. This transformed Parnell from a respected leader to a national hero.|$|R

40|$|This paper, {{after a brief}} {{historical}} introduction {{about the}} author analyses some features of phenomenological anthropology of Gerda Walther, taking especially into account his main work, Phenomenology of the Mystical, from the second edition of 1955 (trad. ital., 2008). In it, Walther presents a <b>real</b> <b>treaty</b> of the philosophical anthropology, {{as part of a}} preliminary analysis of the mystical phenomena to relate anthropological elements from a phenomenological analysis of the human being and the philosophical-religious problems of mystical experience and paranormal experiences. In this work identifies, in addition to the influence of the Husserl’s method, the influx of Pfänder’s phenomenology, mainly in the use of metaphors to explain the formation of the human person. One of the fundamental theses of his anthropology is that every human being has an I-Center (Ichzentrum) with the features of self-consciousness and capability to will. In it, the author showed dependence of elaboration from Pfänder’s Comprehensive Psychology, but also of the phenomenology of Husserl, Scheler and Stein, in particular by its conception of “heart of me” (Einbettung des Ich) which denotes similarities with the “I-animic” of Stein, a concept derived from a review of “I-pure” of Husserl...|$|E

The Cypriot humanist seeks to reconcile not only Horace, Cicero and Aristotle but also the Rhetoric and Poetic of the latter; {{in order to make}} of the metaphor the figure par excellence of mimesis. He is able to do that thanks to a network of comparisons in the theater’s field. Here, the metaphor is defined as the most suitable figure of the mimetic genres of tragedy and comedy but also that of poetic discourse as opposed to historical discourse...|$|R
5000|$|A French army under Marshal François-Joseph, Créqui bombarded Luxembourg with 3,000 to 4,000 mortar shells between 22 and 26 December 1683 {{and withdrew}} from the city. However, the real siege of Luxembourg began the next spring when, {{assisted}} by his technical expert on siege warfare, Sébastien le Prestre de Vauban, Louis once again surrounded the large fortress at Luxembourg on 29 April 1684. [...] The fortress was defended by 2,500 men and they fought on against the French army until 3 June 1684 when they surrendered. Spanish forces in the Netherlands, backed by the Holy Roman Empire, continued to fight the French, until a final treaty in the war was reached at Truce of Ratisbon on 15 August 1684. France continued to hold all the territory taken during the war, including Strasbourg and Luxembourg. France's subsequent actions taken after the war were intended only to turn the truce into a <b>real,</b> permanent <b>treaty.</b>|$|R
25|$|Arnot {{was still}} in Britain but Charles Swan and Dan Crawford were present. Msiri and his {{officials}} could not read English and Sharpe described the agreement favourably, but Arnot had advised Msiri to have any treaties translated, and Swan now gave the same advice. For this the missionaries were later criticised by the British, because when the <b>treaty's</b> <b>real</b> contents were revealed to Msiri, enraged, he sent Sharpe away empty-handed. Sharpe was sure Msiri would not sign away his sovereignty to any other power, and he advised Johnston to wait until he was 'out of the way'.|$|R
5000|$|Zapp {{eventually}} {{proposes to}} marry Munda, and they quickly arrange a marriage aboard his ship, but unfortunately scheduling {{it at the}} same time as an important diplomatic function with the Carcarons. At the negotiation, Munda realizes that Zapp plans on having the Carcarons unknowingly sign a declaration of war against Earth. He instructs Munda to tell them it is a peace treaty, so that they will sign it and he can proceed to attack them. Enraged by this, Munda calls off the wedding and tells the Carcarons what Zapp is actually planning. The enraged Carcarons begin to fire wave-like beams at the ship, threatening to destroy it. The attacks end up putting the weapons on Zapp's ship offline. Morris (who had stowed aboard the Planet Express ship to try to stop the marriage) offers to help guide the ship using his surfing skills to manipulate an auxiliary control device that allows them to [...] "surf" [...] the Carcarons' waves. Munda realizes why she had fallen in love with Morris in the first place. She then forces Zapp to apologize to the Carcarons in their language. Once the ship is safe and a <b>real</b> peace <b>treaty</b> is made with the Carcarons, Morris and Munda reaffirm their love for each other and remarry, which Zapp officiates. When Zapp tries to flirt with Munda again, Morris punches him in the gut. Morris and Munda then space-surf their way back to Earth.|$|R
40|$|The Author (2016). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. There {{being no}} International Refugee Court, {{one way that}} the {{international}} protection of refugees develops is through domestic courts interpreting the Refugee Convention, and through cases brought before international and regional human rights treaty bodies. UNHCR's supervisory role, set out in article 35 of the Refugee Convention and paragraphs 1 and 8 (a) of the UNHCR Statute, authorizes its engagement in such court cases through amicus curiae briefs. Nevertheless, such engagement presents risks for the organization. If a court ignores or rejects UNHCR's arguments, does that undermine UNHCR's authority to speak on that particular issue? Or can the finding simply be dismissed as an aberrant decision by a court in one particular State party to the Refugee Convention? By contrast, the international or regional human rights bodies are addressing {{a different set of}} rights, so there is less risk. However, this stance cannot be maintained with respect to the Court of Justice of the European Union when receiving a reference from one of the 28 Member States under the European Union Qualification Directive that incorporates the Refugee Convention. Nevertheless, the development of the international law protecting refugees does not take place just through the courts. UNHCR is, in a very <b>real</b> sense, the <b>treaty</b> body of the Refugee Convention. Its statutory protection mandate for refugees invests its Guidelines, the Executive Committee's Conclusions, and the annual Notes on International Protection with an authority that all courts and decision makers, as well as governments, should recognize and acknowledge...|$|R
40|$|This article {{analyzes}} {{the magnitude of}} the treaty shopping practice and draws relevant theoretical and policy implications for proper rule-making. This fills the gap in the literature, as it is based on a comprehensive survey of tribunal awards to assess the <b>real</b> prevalence of <b>treaty</b> shopping. Also, observing that in all systems of law, whether domestic or international, there are concepts framed in order to avoid misuse of the law; reference may be made in this respect to 2 ̆ 2 good faith 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 bonne foi 2 ̆ 2), 2 ̆ 2 détournement de pouvoir 2 ̆ 2 (misuse of power) or 2 ̆ 2 abus de droit 2 ̆ 2 (abuse of right), this Article seeks to identify the legal principles used by international tribunals {{to address the issue of}} treaty shopping. On this basis, this article more specifically discusses three critical issues. First, whether treaty shopping is good or bad from various angles (from both the state and investor perspectives). Second, what is the implication of having a different type of investment treaty (non-harmonized investment treaties), given that the treaty shopping problem exists? Third, how to mitigate the negative aspects of the treaty shopping problem? What type of provisions and clauses are necessary to prevent treaty shopping or to reduce the negative side of treat shopping? The article presents in Part II the recent evolution of international investment law and identifies the legal determinants of treaty shopping. Part III goes on to review the practice and reality of treaty shopping. Subsequently, Part IV provides a mapping of the cause of treaty shopping. Part V then presents an account of existing provisions designed to control treaty shopping. Finally, policy conclusions are drawn in the conclusion...|$|R
