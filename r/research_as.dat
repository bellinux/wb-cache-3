5|$|In 1940, Rhoads was {{selected}} as director of Memorial Hospital, which was devoted to cancer care and research, and had recently {{moved into a new}} building. Rhoads {{was selected}} for his interest in clinical investigation in addition to laboratory <b>research,</b> <b>as</b> the hospital did <b>research</b> <b>as</b> well as treatment. He succeeded James Ewing, a noted oncologist. Ewing had written about cancer transplantation in 1931, a subject which Rhoads had referred to in his scandalous letter written in November of that year. In 1941 Rhoads was studying the use of radiation to treat leukemia.|$|E

5|$|The German Neumayer-Station III, {{finished}} in 2009, succeeded two former stations that were buried by snow and ice. It conducts geophysical, meteorological and seismological <b>research,</b> <b>as</b> well as air chemistry measurements and atmospheric ozone monitoring. Germany's other station, Kohnen, was opened {{as part of}} a major ice-drilling project.|$|E
5|$|Temsirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, {{is under}} {{investigation}} as a potential treatment. Research shows that mTOR inhibitors may be particularly effective for cancers with mutations in PTEN. Ridaforolimus (deforolimus) is also being <b>researched</b> <b>as</b> a treatment {{for people who have}} previously had chemotherapy. Preliminary research has been promising, and a stage II trial for ridaforolimus was completed by 2013. There has also been research on combined ridaforolimus/progestin treatments for recurrent endometrial cancer. Bevacizumab and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which inhibit angiogenesis, are being <b>researched</b> <b>as</b> potential treatments for endometrial cancers with high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor. Ixabepilone is being <b>researched</b> <b>as</b> a possible chemotherapy for advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. Treatments for rare high-grade undifferentiated endometrial sarcoma are being <b>researched,</b> <b>as</b> there is no established standard of care yet for this disease. Chemotherapies being researched include doxorubicin and ifosfamide.|$|R

5|$|Actinium-227 {{is used as}} {{a neutron}} source. Its high {{specific}} energy (14.5 W/g) and the possibility of obtaining significant quantities of thermally stable compounds are attractive for use in long-lasting thermoelectric generators for remote use. 228Ac {{is used as a}}n indicator of radioactivity in chemical <b>research,</b> <b>as</b> it emits high-energy electrons (2.18 MeV) that can be easily detected. 228Ac-228Ra mixtures are widely used as an intense gamma-source in industry and medicine.|$|E
5|$|Argo Tea {{advocates for}} sustainability, {{demonstrates}} concern {{and awareness of}} environmental issues in their business plan and uses charitable donations to promote <b>research</b> <b>as</b> noted above.

5|$|Bahrain {{was one of}} 11 Arab {{states which}} counted a {{majority}} of female university graduates {{in science and engineering}} in 2014. Women accounted for 66% of graduates in natural sciences, 28% of those in engineering and 77% of those in health and welfare. It is harder to judge the contribution of women to <b>research,</b> <b>as</b> the data for 2013 only cover the higher education sector.|$|E
5|$|Bradner {{worked on}} the 1951 Operation Greenhouse nuclear test series on Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. He joined the Scripps Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics as a {{geophysicist}} in 1961.

5|$|Due {{to several}} taxonomic {{revisions}} by Russell Mittermeier, Colin Groves, and others, {{the number of}} recognized lemur species has grown from 33 species and subspecies in 1994 to approximately 100 in 2008. With continuing cytogenetic and molecular genetic <b>research,</b> <b>as</b> well as ongoing field studies, particularly with cryptic species such as mouse lemurs, the number of recognized lemur species is likely to keep growing. However, the rapid {{increase in the number}} of recognized species has had its critics among taxonomists and lemur researchers. Since classifications ultimately depend on the species concept used, conservationists often favor definitions that result in the splitting of genetically distinct populations into separate species to gain added environmental protection. Others favor a more thorough analysis.|$|E
5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted and polished. In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used much of the <b>research</b> <b>as</b> background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E
5|$|Gorman {{said that}} his Catholic {{grandmother}} had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged {{as part of a}} conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the belief of Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his <b>research</b> <b>as</b> the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1930s, Smyth {{began to}} shift his {{interest}} to nuclear physics, inspired by James Chadwick's {{discovery of the}} neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton splitting the atom, and Ernest Lawrence's invention of the cyclotron. Three of his last research articles concerned detection of triatomic hydrogen and helium-3. His appointment as department chair forced him to {{devote more time to}} administrative work, at the expense of <b>research.</b> <b>As</b> department chair, he had two cyclotrons built at Princeton, one in 1935 and the other in 1946.|$|E

5|$|Marquis {{was taught}} Indian Sign Language by the Crow. This {{would be a}} great help to him in his <b>research</b> <b>as</b> the {{language}} was common to all the plains tribes. Marquis also had lessons from John Stands in Timber, the Cheyenne tribal historian and grandson of Lame White Man, a Cheyenne chief killed in the battle with Custer. Together with co-author Margot Liberty, Stands in Timber published Cheyenne Memories shortly before he died in 1967.|$|E
