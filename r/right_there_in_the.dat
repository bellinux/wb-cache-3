And of course, Lubbock was talking to two people who didn't know a C from a B natural. The pressure was on". So they stood near Pettibone's Mac and sang the notes, with Lubbock correcting them. The total recording was finished off in 2 hours and 58 minutes, thereby saving to pay the orchestra the extra fees. The last recording of the song was on Memorial Day where Madonna re-did the lead vocals and improved them. Together they did some final edits of the track and finished it.|$|E

The Latin pop ballad was written and produced by Shakira and her frequent collaborator Lester Mendez, who had previously worked with her on songs including [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] (2002) and [...] "La Tortura" [...] (2005). The musical instrumentation of the song is simple and consists of a piano and acoustic guitar.

[...] Shakira talked about the deep meaning behind the balladry of the album and expressed difficulty in explaining it, saying: [...] "We all go through hard moments.

The video casts Cyrus as an exotic {{songbird}} {{breaking out of}} its cage, symbolizing Cyrus as a singer breaking out of her good-girl image. Prior to the shoot, Cyrus meticulously recorded her ideas for the video on paper. For example, she chose her back-up dancers make-up pallets and contemplated their outfits; while {{she did not want}} her dancer's bodies [...] "to look like normal bodies", she also did not want for them to wear scales as, according to her, it would make them resemble to be fish and look scary. Hales wanted Cyrus to resemble a bird without [...] "actually having a beak" [...] or otherwise being overly explicit, so Cyrus' stylists invented bird-like accessories. Among these were arm bands with long leather straps, feathered shoulder pads, and a feathered vest worn over a black leotard and thigh-high black leather boots. Cyrus said she had originally worn a [...] "completely different" [...] outfit, but wasn't [...] "feeling it" [...] the morning of the shoot. [...] "So we made this one <b>right</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning, and we added pieces throughout the day... more leather and more feathers. I think it's really fun and kept changing the look," [...] she said. Cyrus' make-up artist, Denika Bedrossian, focused on the singer's eyes; he used [...] "rich jewel-toned shades" [...] and eyelashes with feathered tips to give Cyrus a [...] "deep peacock eye". In cut-scenes, Cyrus wears a corset made of 2,400 silver metal pieces and numerous peacock feathers. It was designed by The Blonds, debuted during their fall 2010 fashion show, and cost $25,000.|$|E
