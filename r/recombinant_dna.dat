Modern biology and biochemistry make intensive use of these techniques in <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> technology. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> is a man-made DNA sequence that has been assembled from other DNA sequences. They can be transformed into organisms in the form of plasmids or in the appropriate format, by using a viral vector. The genetically modified organisms produced can be used to produce products such as recombinant proteins, used in medical research, or be grown in agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Wary of the {{potential}} dangers (particularly {{the possibility of a}} prolific bacteria with a viral cancer-causing gene), the scientific community as well as a wide range of scientific outsiders reacted to these developments with both enthusiasm and fearful restraint. Prominent molecular biologists led by Berg suggested a temporary moratorium on <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research until the dangers could be assessed and policies could be created. This moratorium was largely respected, until the participants in the 1975 Asilomar Conference on <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> created policy recommendations and concluded that the technology could be used safely.|$|E

5|$|The field {{grew from}} 19th century beginnings, where {{embryology}} faced a mystery: zoologists {{did not know}} how embryonic development was controlled at the molecular level. Charles Darwin noted that having similar embryos implied common ancestry, but little progress was made until the 1970s. Then, <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> technology at last brought embryology together with molecular genetics. A key early discovery was of homeotic genes that regulate development {{in a wide range of}} eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the modern}} sense of genetic {{engineering}} began in the 1970s, with the invention of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> techniques. Restriction enzymes were discovered and characterized in the late 1960s, following {{on the heels of}} the isolation, then duplication, then synthesis of viral genes. Beginning with the lab of Paul Berg in 1972 (aided by EcoRI from Herbert Boyer's lab, building on work with ligase by Arthur Kornberg's lab), molecular biologists put these pieces together to produce the first transgenic organisms. Soon after, others began using plasmid vectors and adding genes for antibiotic resistance, greatly increasing the reach of the recombinant techniques.|$|E
40|$|The small {{envelope}} of hepatitis B virus (HBV) can self-assembles into virus-like particles (VLPs) {{and they are}} highly immunogenic. The use of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) as a vector to deliver foreign CTL epitopes has met with little success due to the constraints of HBsAg stability and secretion imposed by the insertion of foreign sequence into critical regions. In this study, {{the efficacy of the}} small HBsAg envelope protein to deliver foreign CTL epitopes using a protective CTL epitope of human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was investigated. The strategy of deleting a DNA sequence encoding HBsAg-specific CTL epitopes at different sites and replacing with DNA sequence encoding RSV CTL epitope resulted in <b>recombinant</b> HBsAg <b>DNA</b> immunogens which elicited effector and memory CTL responses in vitro, and RSV protective responses in vivo when these <b>recombinant</b> HBsAg <b>DNAs</b> were used to immunised mice. These data demonstrate the efficacy of HBsAg DNA as a vector for the delivery of disease relevant protective CTL responses. They also suggest the applicability of the approach to derive <b>recombinant</b> HBsAg <b>DNA</b> immunogens simultaneously encoding protective CTL epitopes for multiple diseases. The use of HBsAg VLPs has been used globally as administered vaccine for hepatitis B virus infection makes it an attractive vector candidate to deliver immunogens for other diseases. Since the HBsAg DNAs we tested formed recombinant HBsAg VLPs, our results have implications for the development of vaccination strategies using either <b>recombinant</b> HBsAg <b>DNA</b> or VLP vaccines...|$|R

40|$|To study {{homologous}} recombination between repeated sequences in an in vitro simian virus 40 (SV 40) replication system, we constructed {{a series of}} substrate DNAs that contain two identical fragments of monkey alpha-satellite repeats. Together with the SV 40 -pBR 322 composite vector encoding Apr and Kmr, the DNAs also contain the Escherichia coli galactokinase gene (galK) positioned between two alpha-satellite fragments. The alpha-satellite sequence used consists of multiple units of tandem 172 -bp sequences which differ by microheterogeneity. The substrate DNAs were incubated in an in vitro SV 40 DNA replication system and used to transform the E. coli galK strain DH 10 B after digestion with DpnI. The number of E. coli galK Apr Kmr colonies which contain <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNAs</b> were determined, and their structures were analyzed. Products of equal and unequal crossovers between identical 172 -bp sequences and between similar but not identical (homeologous) 172 -bp sequences, respectively, were detected, although those of the equal crossover were predominant among all of the galK mutant recombinants. Similar products were also observed in the in vivo experiments with COS 1 cells. The in vitro experiments showed that these recombinations were dependent {{on the presence of}} both the SV 40 origin of DNA replication and SV 40 large T antigen. Most of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNAs</b> were generated from newly synthesized DpnI-resistant DNAs. These results suggest that the {{homologous recombination}} observed in this SV 40 system is associated with DNA replication and is suppressed by mismatches in heteroduplexes formed between similar but not identical sequences...|$|R

All of the transfected cells expressing an intact mouse ODC protein displayed regulation of ODC activity, including those expressing a construct deprived of all ODC-specific sequence information except the protein-coding region. ODC mRNA changed much less than enzymatic activity. A mutation of the protein-coding region that converted ODC from an unstable to a stable intracellular protein attenuated the regulatory response.

25|$|Bringing science {{into the}} public eye also coincided with the rapid rate at which <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> {{technology}} entered the industrial world. Because of the practical applications of the technology, funding for research using it started coming more {{from the private sector}} and less from the public sector. In addition, many molecular biologists who once confined themselves to academia, developed ties with private industry as equity owners, corporate executives and consultants. This {{led to the creation of}} a biotechnology industry, although during this time, public debates occur over the hazards of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA.</b> These debates were eventually won over by scientists who stated that the hazards were exaggerated and that the research could be conducted safely. Such was seen in the Ascot report, found in the Federal Register in March 1978. This report emphasized that the hazards of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> to the general community were small to the point that they were of no practical consequence to the general public. For this reason, along with high economic pressures for industrial development and a more supportive political environment that existed after 1979, research and industry based on <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> continued to expand.|$|E

40|$|Several {{murine leukemia}} viruses (MuLV) {{replicate}} efficiently in the thymus (T+) of the mouse, whereas others {{are unable to}} replicate (T-) in this organ.

(N- and B-tropic refer to the Fv- 1 host range of MuLV.) Infectious recombinant MuLVs, recovered from murine cells microinjected with these <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNAs,</b> were injected into newborn mice to test their ability to replicate in the thymus. We found that the long terminal repeat from the T+ BALB/c B-tropic or AKR Gross passage A MuLV genome was sufficient to allow replication of recombinant MuLVs in the thymus.

This committee, called the Committee on <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules of the National Academy of Science, U.S.A., held in 1974, concluded that an international conference was necessary to resolve the issue and that until that time, scientists should halt experiments involving <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> technology.|$|E

During the conference, the principles guiding the recommendations for how to conduct experiments using this technology safely were established.

25|$|Molecular cloning {{is a set}} of {{experimental}} methods in molecular biology that are used to assemble <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules and to direct their replication within host organisms. The use of the word cloning refers {{to the fact that the}} method involves the replication of one molecule to produce a population of cells with identical DNA molecules. Molecular cloning generally uses DNA sequences from two different organisms: the species that is the source of the DNA to be cloned, and the species that will serve as the living host for replication of the <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA.</b> Molecular cloning methods are central to many contemporary areas of modern biology and medicine.|$|E
25|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> {{technology}} arose as {{a result}} of advances in biology that began in the 1950s and 60’s. During these decades, a tradition of merging the structural, biochemical and informational approaches to the central problems of classical genetics became more apparent. Two main underlying concepts of this tradition were that genes consisted of DNA and that DNA encoded information that determined the processes of replication and protein synthesis. These concepts were embodied in the model of DNA proposed by James Watson and Francis Crick, and further research on the Watson-Crick model yielded theoretical advances that were reflected in new capacities to manipulate DNA. One of these capacities was <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> technology.|$|E

Superinfection with helper virus lacking the WSN NA gene resulted in the release of virus containing the WSN NA gene. We then introduced five point mutations into the WSN NA gene by cassette mutagenesis of the plasmid DNA. Sequence analysis of the rescued virus revealed that the genome contained all five mutations present in the mutated plasmid. The ability to create viruses with site-specific mutations will allow the engineering of influenza viruses with defined biological properties...|$|R
