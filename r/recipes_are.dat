5|$|In {{the second}} part, David devotes {{chapters}} to recipes for {{various forms of}} baking. Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in her earlier books, the <b>recipes</b> <b>are</b> interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.|$|E
5|$|All <b>recipes</b> <b>are</b> {{written in}} the second-person {{singular}} imperative, a grammatical form {{that would not have}} been used to address a person of high rank. The instructions were most likely meant to be read aloud by the chef or one of senior cooks to junior members of the kitchen staff, who would carry them out. This style contrasts with the less direct, impersonal way of addressing the reader, characterized by infinitive verb forms, used in 19th-century Polish cookbooks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{origin of}} the <b>recipe</b> <b>is</b> disputed by Tony Bailey, who runs a West Indian {{takeaway}} in Brixton, South London; [...] "The <b>recipe</b> <b>is</b> mine. People round here know, but we don’t say." ...|$|R

50|$|Jeera rice <b>recipe</b> <b>is</b> {{not found}} in ancient books and scripts of Indian recipes and culinary art. Text about this <b>recipe</b> can <b>be</b> found in books and travelogues since the Mughal Empire. Mughals were fond of rice recipes, because of which cooks worked to invent new rice recipes as well as did {{experiments}} with tradition old recipes. Jeera rice <b>recipe</b> <b>is</b> one of those rice recipes. Later on, it was adopted in Indian cuisine and became so popular that the <b>recipe</b> <b>is</b> now cooked daily by almost every Indian family.|$|R
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner <b>recipes</b> <b>are</b> popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to be had after dinner.|$|E
5|$|South Wind Through the Kitchen (1997) was the {{completion}} {{of one of the}} projects of David's later years on which she worked with Norman: a single-volume collection of the best of her extensive writings. Norman invited chefs, writers and David's friends to choose their favourite of her articles and recipes. Many of the contributors, such as the chef Simon Hopkinson, contributed an introduction or afterword to the pieces they chose. The extracts and <b>recipes</b> <b>are</b> taken from all David's books published by 1996. There are more than 200 recipes, organised in the customary way with sections on courses and ingredients—eggs and cheese, fish and shellfish, meat, poultry and game, vegetables, pasta, pulses and grains, sauces, sweet dishes and cakes, preserves, and bread—interspersed, as in David's earlier works, with articles and essays. The title of the book comes from an essay published in 1964 and reprinted in An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, and is a reference to South Wind, a novel by David's mentor Norman Douglas.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{have several}} {{different}} stats and gauges: their health (HP), a magic meter stocked by Technical Points (TP), and Learning Points (LP) for learning skills. a character's respective agility or luck, {{and how a}} character reacts to attacks. Attack types are physical and magical, while defense is limited to physical attacks. Characters gain experience levels through accumulating experience points (EXP). EXP and Gald is earned through battles, along with recovering a degree of TP and occasionally items dropped by defeated enemies. Skills, attributes that change different stats, can be assigned to each character. The number of skills that can be assigned is calculated {{by the number of}} skill points each character has available. Battling with equipment associated with a particular skill enables that character to learn it when they have filled their LP meter. Cooking, creating meals with ingredients found in battle or around explored environments, can also be used by individual characters to restore their HP and TP and grant temporary enhancements. <b>Recipes</b> <b>are</b> learned from a character called the Wonder Chef.|$|E

25|$|The Mediterranean diet {{forms the}} basis of Italian cuisine, rich in pasta, fish, fruits and {{vegetables}} and characterised by its extreme simplicity and variety, with many dishes having only four to eight ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly {{on the quality of the}} ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Dishes and <b>recipes</b> <b>are</b> often derivatives from local and familial tradition rather than created by chefs, so many <b>recipes</b> <b>are</b> ideally suited for home cooking, this being one of the main reasons behind the ever-increasing worldwide popularity of Italian cuisine, from America to Asia. Ingredients and dishes vary widely by region.|$|E
