5|$|I {{had that}} beat {{actually}} {{before she got}} to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That {{was one of the first}} records we had. I didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> what to do for her because I didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but I just felt like she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> where to go. But I went to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E
5|$|Metzen {{began his}} career in design after {{applying}} to Blizzard Entertainment, then known as Chaos Studios, {{on the recommendation of}} a friend who had seen his work. He was quickly recruited by the company, although Metzen states that at the time he did not <b>really</b> <b>know</b> what Blizzard Entertainment dealt with, assuming it was a graphic design studio rather than a video game developer.|$|E

5|$|The Season Seven DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Gabe inviting Stanley to his party and Stanley's reaction, Michael making fun of Gabe and then noting in a talking head {{that he does not}} <b>really</b> <b>know</b> Gabe, Michael raiding Gabe's kitchen cabinet for additional items to add to his pizza, Michael comparing himself to Tom Hanks in the 1988 film Big and Gabe to Hanks in the 1993 film Philadelphia, Michael trying his pizza, only to spit it out, and Pam and Jim marveling at CeCe sleeping.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{believes}} Martha influenced Lionel {{to start}} believing that sacrifice {{is necessary to}} make the world a better place. When she leaves at the end of season six, Lionel no longer has that influence. He is constantly battling the dark and light sides of his personality. According to series writer Caroline Dries, the audience never <b>really</b> <b>know</b> his motivations because of this balancing act. Dries said this is embodied when he threatens Lana into marrying Lex, later revealing it was to protect Clark. Glover describes his off-screen relationship with Annette O'Toole the reason Martha and Lionel have such good chemistry. Glover said that when Martha and Lionel are talking to each other it feels as though he and O'Toole are sharing a conversation, and that trust is visualized on the camera.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, MacFarlane was {{scheduled}} to return to Los Angeles on American Airlines Flight 11 from Boston. Suffering from a hangover after the previous night's celebrations that followed his speech at his alma mater, the Rhode Island School of Design, and with an incorrect departure time (8:15a.m. instead of 7:45a.m.) from his travel agent, he arrived at Logan International Airport about ten minutes too late to board the flight as the gates had been closed. Fifteen minutes after departure, American Airlines Flight 11 was hijacked, and at 8:46a.m. it was flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, killing everyone on board. MacFarlane said,The only reason it hasn't really affected me as it maybe could have is I didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> that I was in any danger until after it was over, so I never had that panic moment. After the fact, it was sobering, but people {{have a lot of}} close calls; you're crossing the street and you almost get hit by a car..... this one just happened to be related to something massive. I really can't let it affect me because I'm a comedy writer. I have to put that {{in the back of my}} head.|$|E

25|$|The movie {{takes place}} everywhere, {{and it takes}} place nowhere. It's a city built of pieces of cities. A corner from one place, another from some place else. So, you don't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> where you are. A piece will look like a street in London, but {{a portion of the}} {{architecture}} looks like New York, but the bottom of the architecture looks again like a European city.

25|$|However, an {{even more}} {{extensive}} and sustainable coastal resource is forage fish, such as anchovies and herring. This fishery {{is an integral part}} of the pole and line tuna fishery, since tuna feed on the forage fish. Future development of the traditional pole and line tuna fishery depends on the availability of this bait fishery. Catch rate for forage fish have increased greatly in recent years, but there is not enough data to <b>really</b> <b>know</b> what the current status of the forage fish stocks are.|$|E

25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too difficult for people to be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I <b>really</b> <b>know</b> of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E
25|$|At Coruña {{the fleet}} was {{assembled}} {{under the command}} of Juan del Aguila as field master general, and Martín de Padilla the Adelantado, commander of the invading troops. The plan had now switched from Ireland with the objective of the Port of Falmouth in Cornwall. The Spanish were to hold the town and port and force Elizabeth into a peace or hoping to attract the Catholic followers and rise up in support. It was estimated that this would be far larger than that of the 1588 invasion attempt. The troopships were to take Falmouth, while the warships would also intercept and destroy Essex's returning fleet from the Azores. The other target as a failsafe as well as a strategic diversion was Milford Haven in Wales, a good landing ground from which Henry VII had landed his men to defeat King Richard III in 1485. A Spanish observer had noted that Milford contained many Catholics who were hostile to the English. The true intentions of the Armada however were confusing to the captains and officers, as they didn't <b>really</b> <b>know</b> whether this was an invasion, raid or naval interception. Only the high command knew for fear of spies & deserters in the fleet as they were taking no chances and all would only be revealed as they approached the English channel.|$|E
