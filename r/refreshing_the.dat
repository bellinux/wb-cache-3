5|$|Rovers kept good league form {{at the end}} of January, {{defeating}} Accrington Stanley and Exeter City, hence losing {{only one}} league game in last nine. On-loan striker Rory Donnelly was nominated and then named Football League Two Player of the Month after scoring three goals in January. By 31 January, Tranmere climbed to 17th place, their highest since August, though above the relegation zone by only two points. Adams continued <b>refreshing</b> <b>the</b> squad by signing Canadian international striker Iain Hume, who returned to Tranmere after ten years, midfielders Rob Taylor and Lee Molyneux and defender Adam Dugdale.|$|E

The ranking {{is based}} on objectively measurable data about US colleges from The National Center for Education Statistics - the weighting factors for different college metrics are given on the site for transparency. Interestingly, <b>refreshing</b> <b>the</b> webpage changes the ranking, showing how sensitive any college ranking process is to the weighting given different factors. While this site is clearly satirical in nature, it makes a profound point regarding the ultimate subjectivity of all college ranking methods.|$|E
25|$|Throughout the film, the {{narrative}} is intercut with scenes from depositions {{taken in the}} Winklevoss twins' and Saverin's respective lawsuits against Zuckerberg and Facebook. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy, a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Zuckerberg that they will settle with Saverin, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Zuckerberg's own callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Zuckerberg is shown sending a friend request to Albright on Facebook and then <b>refreshing</b> <b>the</b> webpage every few seconds as he waits for her response.|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, but we can make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby <b>refreshing</b> <b>the</b> world and ourselves.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, Lin Bolen, then Vice President of Daytime Programming at NBC, began {{eliminating}} longer-running {{game shows}} from the network in an aggressive attempt to bolster ratings among women aged 18–34. <b>Refreshing</b> <b>the</b> daytime lineup became especially imperative to Bolen when CBS launched a surprise {{success in the}} soap opera The Young and the Restless at 12:00p.m. EST (11:00a.m. CST), drawing away younger audiences in particular. Although Jeopardy! continued to produce high ratings in the 12:00 noon time slot (also against the ABC revival of Password), Bolen moved the game to 10:30a.m. Eastern (9:30 Central) on January 7, 1974, putting it up against CBS' The $10,000 Pyramid, and placed Jackpot!, a stylish, youth-oriented riddle contest hosted by Geoff Edwards, in Jeopardy! former time slot. Bolen and other NBC executives were surprised, though, when Jeopardy actually beat Pyramid for several weeks in February and March, prompting CBS to cancel Pyramid for failing to draw, according to producer Bob Stewart (who also produced Jackpot!), a 30 share that CBS daytime executives required a show to have {{in order to stay}} on its daytime schedule (Pyramid returned several weeks later on ABC in an afternoon slot and went on {{to become one of the}} most popular games of the 1970s and 1980s.) CBS relocated Gambit to 10:30a.m. on April 1, which ran about even with Jeopardy! in the ratings, with Gambit having perhaps a slight lead, due to its more traditional housewife target audience.|$|E

It is striking that he encountered the border of Scythia, turned around, and went around Europe counter-clockwise until he came to the southern side of Scythia on the Black Sea. It is possible to speculate that he may have hoped to circumnavigate Europe, but the sources do not say. In other, even more speculative interpretations, Pytheas returned north and the Tanais is not the Don but is a northern river, such as the Elbe river.|$|E
