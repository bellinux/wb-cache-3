The author studied on some physiological aspects of streptomycin-dependent strain of Escherichia coli in comparison with streptomycin sensitive strain. The results are summarized as follows: 1) By inoculation of a great amount of streptomycin-sensitive E. coli on plain broth agar plates containing 1. 000 γ / cc of streptomycin, one streptomycin-dependent strain was isolated. 2) The <b>reverse</b> <b>mutant</b> from this dependent strain was a streptomycin-sensitive strain, the re-reverse mutant from this <b>reverse</b> <b>mutant</b> was a dependent strain, and no resistant strain could be obtained. 3) This dependent stain could not multiply using streptomycin as the sole carbon or nitrogen source. 4) This dependent strain showed a higher requirement to streptomycin in the media containing the fatty acits related to the citric acid cycle than in those containing amino acids as its growth substrates. 5) Streptomycin showed no noticeable action on the respiration of this dependent strain. From these results, it is inferred that streptcomycin works not as a nutriment but as some working factor for the growth or multiplication of the streptomycin-dependent E. coli...|$|E

We report here {{the implementation of}} both approaches with full regulatory range in gram-positive bacteria as exemplified in Bacillus subtilis. A chromosomally located gene is controlled by one or two tet operators. The precise adjustment of regulatory windows is accomplished by adjusting tetR or revtetR expression via different promoters. The most efficient induction was 300 -fold {{in the presence of}} 0. 4 μM anhydrotetracycline obtained with a Pr-xylA-tetR fusion. Reversible 500 -fold gene knockouts were obtained in B. subtilis after adjusting expression of revTetR by synthetically designed promoters.

This lower virulence of strain Rv 6 was not modified by 10 passages in susceptible mice. Vaccination with strain Rv 6 induced a dose-dependent capacity of mice to control subsequent infection with the virulent parental strain.

40|$|Abstract. �B-crystallin (AJ 245805) {{is a major}} protein {{component}} (20 %) in the {{eye lens}} of the gecko Lepidodactylus lugubris. Limited peptide sequence analysis earlier revealed that {{it belongs to the}} aldo-keto reductase superfamily, as does the frog lens �-crystallin. We have now determined the complete cDNA sequence of �Bcrystallin and established that it is more closely related to the aldose reductase branch of the superfamily than to frog �-crystallin. These gecko and frog lens proteins have thus independently been recruited from the same enzyme superfamily. Aldose reductase is implicated in the development of diabetic cataract in mammals, and, if active, �B-crystallin might be a potential risk for the gecko lens. Apart from a replacement 298 Cys → Tyr, �B-crystallin possesses all amino acid residues thought to be required for catalytic activity of the aldose reductases. However, modeling studies of the �B-crystallin structure indicate that substrate specificity and nicotinamide cofactor affinity might be affected. Indeed, neither recombinant �B-crystallin nor the <b>reverse</b> <b>mutant</b> 298 Tyr → Cys showed noticeable activity toward aliphatic and aromatic substrates, although cofactor binding was retained. Various other oxidoreductases are known to be recruited as abundant lens proteins in many vertebrate species; �B-crystallin demonstrates that an aldose reductase-related enzyme also can be modified to this end...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo test {{requirement}} for apoptin in the replication of chicken anemia virus (CAV), an apoptin-knockout clone, pCAV/Ap(−), was constructed. DNA replication was completely abolished in cells transfected with replicative form of CAV/Ap(−). A <b>reverse</b> <b>mutant</b> competent in apoptin production regained the full level of DNA replication. DNA replication and virus-like particle (VLP) production of CAV/Ap(−) was fully complemented by supplementation of the wild-type apoptin. The virus yield {{of a point}} mutant, CAV/ApT 108 I, was 1 / 40 that of the wild type, even though its DNA replication level was full. The infectious titer of CAV was fully complemented by supplementing apoptin. Progeny virus was free from reverse mutation for T 108 I. To localize the domain within apoptin molecule inevitable for CAV replication, apoptin-mutant expressing plasmids, pAp 1, pAp 2, pAp 3, and pAp 4, were constructed by deleting amino acids 10 – 36, 31 – 59, 59 – 88 and 80 – 112, respectively. While Ap 1 and Ap 2 were preferentially localized in nuclei, Ap 3 and Ap 4 were mainly present in cytoplasm. Although complementation capacity of Ap 3 and Ap 4 was 1 / 10 of the wild type, neither of them completely lost its activity. VP 3 of TTV did fully complement the DNA replication and VLP of CAV/Ap(−). These data suggest that apoptin is inevitable not only for DNA replication but also VLP of CAV. The common feature of apoptin and TTV-VP 3 presented another evidence for close relatedness of CAV and TTV...|$|E

DPD 1 spreads to uninoculated leaves, whereas NY is restricted to the inoculated leaves. The NY isolate was found to move from cell to cell infecting all parts of the inoculated leaves, including the petiole. The coat protein (CP) coding region was identified as the determinant of long-distance movement. Virus chimeras containing the CP coding sequence of NY were restricted to inoculated leaves, whereas chimeras containing the CP coding sequence of DPD 1 infectedC. quinoasystemically. Mutational analysis of the CP demonstrated that changing the serine at position 47 of the NY CP to proline was sufficient to permit systemic spread of the NY(S 47 P) mutant. The <b>reverse</b> <b>mutant,</b> DPD 1 (P 47 S), in which the proline at position 47 of the CP was changed to serine, was restricted to inoculated leaves. The movement characteristics and CP sequences of 10 additional PSbMV isolates were determined. All isolates caused systemic infection in pea. InC. quinoa 6 of the isolates that were restricted to inoculated leaves had a serine at position 47. Two isolates that infectedC. quinoasystemically had a proline at position 47. Two isolates, S 6 and NEP- 1, infectedC. quinoasystemically, but had a serine at position 47 of the CP. This shows that although a proline/serine difference at position 47 of the CP determined systemic spread of the isolates DPD 1 and NY, this amino acid alone does not govern the spread of PSbMV inC. quinoa...|$|E

The <b>reverse</b> transcriptase <b>mutants</b> contained alterations in residues that modeling of substrates into the catalytic core had suggested might affect interactions with primer and/or template strands. As assessed by the frequency of functional lacZ gene generation from vectors in which lacZ was disrupted by insertion of a sequence duplication, the frequency of template switching varied more than threefold among fully replication-competent mutants. Some mutants displayed deletion rates that were lower and others displayed rates that were {{higher than that of}} wild-type virus. Replication for the mutants with the most significant alterations in template switching frequencies was {{similar to that of the}} wild type.

40|$|Residues in {{the second}} {{extracellular}} loop (e 2) {{play a role in}} ligand binding in certain aminergic G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs). N-[3 -(1 H-Imidazol- 4 -yl) propyl) ]guanidines and N G-acylated derivatives are more efficacious and potent agonists at fusion proteins of the guinea pig histamine H 2 receptor and the short splice variant of Gsα, GsαS (gpH 2 R-GsαS) than at the human isoform (hH 2 R-GsαS). To elucidate the structural basis for this species-selectivity, we generated a mutant hH 2 R-GsαS fusion protein with the four e 2 residues differing in both species isoforms mutated into the gpH 2 R sequence, and a <b>reverse</b> <b>mutant</b> of the gpH 2 R-GsαS with the corresponding mutations into the human species. In a steady-state GTPase activity assay, efficacies and potencies of guanidine-type agonists were similar at mutant and wild-type receptors indicating that e 2 does not contribute to the species-selectivity. In several class 1 GPCRs, amino acids in the vicinity of a highly conserved cysteine in e 2 participate in ligand binding. A three-dimensional homology model of the hH 2 R predicted Lys- 173 and Lys- 175, adjacent to Cys- 174 in e 2, to be in close proximity to the binding pocket of guanidine-type agonists. To elucidate the putative role of both residues for interactions with the agonists, two hH 2 R-GsαS fusion proteins, with single-point mutations of Lys- 173 →Ala- 173 and Lys- 175 →Ala- 175 respectively, were generated. With these mutants, the efficacies and potencies of small and bulky H 2 R agonists did not significantly change. However, increases in GTPase activity upon agonist stimulation were reduced, suggesting an impact of both residues on the efficiency of receptor coupling to GsαS. In conclusion, none of the point mutations generated within this study substantially altered the efficacies and potencies of guanidine-type agonists relative to the wild-type receptors, suggesting that these residues do not directly face the H 2 R guanidine-binding pocket. Thus, agonist binding to residues in e 2 is relevant for some but not all aminergic GPCRs...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that cytokinins are a class of {{phytohormones}} that promote cell division in plant roots and shoots. However, their targets, biological functions, and implications in mammalian systems have rarely been examined. In this study, we show that one cytokinin, zeatin riboside, can prevent pheochromocytoma (PC 12) cells from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis by acting on the adenosine A 2 A receptor (A 2 A-R), which was blocked by an A 2 A-R antagonist and a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor, demonstrating the functional ability of zeatin riboside by mediating through A 2 A-R signaling event. Since the A 2 A-R was implicated as a therapeutic target in treating Huntington’s disease (HD), a cellular model of HD was applied by transfecting mutant huntingtin in PC 12 cells. By using filter retardation assay and confocal microscopy we found that zeatin riboside <b>reversed</b> <b>mutant</b> huntingtin (Htt) -induced protein aggregations and proteasome deactivation through A 2 A-R signaling. PKA inhibitor blocked zeatin riboside-induced suppression of mutant Htt aggregations. In addition, PKA activated proteasome activity and reduced mutant Htt protein aggregations. However, a proteasome inhibitor blocked both zeatin riboside-and PKA activator-mediated suppression of mutant Htt aggregations, confirming mediation of the A 2 A-R/PKA/proteasome pathway. Taken together, zeatin riboside might have therapeutic potential as a novel neuroprotectant and a lead for treating neurodegenerative disorders...|$|R

The Ty 3 structural proteins, capsid and nucleocapsid, contain major homology and nucleocapsid motifs similar to retrovirus capsid and nucleocapsid proteins, but Ty 3 lacks a matrix-like structural domain amino terminal to capsid. Mass spectrometry analysis of Ty 3 Gag 3 processing products defined an acetylated Ser residue as the amino terminus of Gag 3 /p 34, p 27, and CA/p 24 species and supported a model where p 34 and p 27 occur in phosphorylated forms. Using atomic force microscopy, VLPs were imaged from cells producing wild-type and protease and <b>reverse</b> transcriptase <b>mutant</b> Ty 3. Wild-type VLPs were found to have a broad range of diameters, but the majority, if not all of the particles, exhibited arrangements of capsomeres on their surfaces which were consistent with icosahedral symmetry. Wild-type particles were in the range of 25 to 52 nm in diameter, with particles in the 42 - to 52 -nm diameter range consistent with T= 7 symmetry. Both classes of mutant VLPs fell into a narrower range of 44 to 53 nm in diameter and appeared to be consistent with T= 7 icosahedral symmetry. The smaller particles in the wild-type population likely correspond to VLPs that have progressed to reverse transcription or later stages, which do not occur in the protease and <b>reverse</b> transcriptase <b>mutants.</b> Ty 3 VLPs did not undergo major external rearrangements during proteolytic maturation.

Five protease mutants showed statistically different fitness values by the MCA versus the SCA: the D 30 N, G 48 V, I 50 V, I 54 L, and I 54 M mutants.

To address this possibility, mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase [deoxynucleoside-triphosphate:DNA deoxynucleotidyltransferase (RNA-directed), EC 2. 7. 7. 49] gene have been introduced by site-directed mutagenesis of cloned constructs in Escherichia coli.

40|$|A 58 U, {{in which}} A 58 was {{replaced}} by U. This mutant tRNA was expressed in CEM cells. We demonstrate {{that the presence of}} M 1 A 58 is necessary for the appropriate termination of plus-strand strong-stop DNA synthesis and that the absence of M 1 A 58 allows RT to read the tRNA sequences beyond residue 58. In addition, we show that replacement of M 1 A 58 with U inhibits the replication of HIV- 1 in vivo. These results highlight the importance of tRNA primer residue A 58 in the reverse transcription process. Inhibition of <b>reverse</b> transcription with <b>mutant</b> tRNA primers constitutes a novel approach for therapeutic intervention against HIV- 1...|$|R
40|$|We tested {{whether the}} {{additional}} positive-strand DNA synthesis initiation of {{human immunodeficiency virus}} type 1 (HIV- 1) from the central polypurine tract (cPPT) facilitates efficient completion of kinetically disturbed proviral DNA synthesis induced by dysfunctional <b>reverse</b> transcriptase (RT) <b>mutants</b> or limited cellular deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pools. Indeed, the cPPT enabled the HIV- 1 vectors harboring RT mutants with reduced dNTP binding affinity to transduce human lung fibroblasts (HLFs), without which these mutant vectors normally fail to transduce. The cPPT showed little effect on wild-type HIV- 1 vector transduction in HLF, whereas it significantly enhanced vector transduction in HLFs engineered to contain reduced dNTP pools, suggesting a novel compensatory role for cPPT in viruses harboring kinetically impaired RT...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{connection}} domain mutation N 348 I confers {{resistance to}} zidovudine (AZT) and {{is associated with}} the lamivudine (3 TC) mutation M 184 V. We explored the biochemical and virological influence of N 348 I in the context of M 184 V. METHODS: Genotypic resistance data for patients receiving monotherapy or dual therapy with AZT, lamivudine (3 TC), or AZT/ 3 TC were analyzed. Rates of N 348 I emergence were compared between treatment groups. <b>Mutant</b> <b>reverse</b> transcriptases (RTs) containing M 184 V and/or N 348 I were generated to study enzymatic and virological properties. RESULTS: We included 50 AZT-treated, 11 3 TC-treated, and 10 AZT/ 3 TC-treated patients. N 348 I was observed in 3 (6...|$|R
40|$|We {{report for}} the first time the in vitro {{characterization}} of a reverse tetracycline repressor (revTetR). The dimeric wild-type repressor (TetR) binds to tet operator tetO in the absence of the inducer anhydrotetracycline (atc) to confer tight repression. We have isolated the revTetR G 96 E L 205 S mutant, which, contrary to TetR, binds tetO only in the presence of atc. This <b>reverse</b> acting <b>mutant</b> was overproduced and purified. Effector and DNA binding properties were analyzed by EMSA and quantified by fluorescence titration and surface plasmon resonance. The association constant KA of revTetR for binding of [atcMg]+ is ∼ 108 M– 1, four orders of magnitude lower than that of TetR. The affinity of TetR for tetO is 5. 6 ± 2 × 109 M– 1 and that for revTetR in the presence of atc is 1 ± 0. 2 × 108 M– 1. Both induced forms, the atc-bound TetR and the free revTetR, have the same low affinity of 4 ± 1 × 105 M– 1 for DNA. Therefore, atc does not act as a dimerization agent for revTetR. We discuss the structural differences between TetR and revTetR potentially underlying this reversal of activity...|$|R
40|$|Type II restriction-modification {{systems are}} {{expected}} to possess mechanisms for tight regulation of their expression to suppress the potential of lethal attack on their host bacteria when they establish and maintain themselves within them. Although the EcoRI restriction enzyme has been well characterized, regulation of its expression is still poorly understood. In this study, mutational analysis with lacZ gene fusion and primer extension assay identified a promoter for the transcription of the ecoRIR gene. Further analyses revealed that an intragenic region containing two overlapping reverse promoter-like elements acted as a negative regulator for ecoRIR gene expression. The activity of these putative reverse promoters was verified by transcriptional gene fusion, primer extension and in vitro transcription. Mutations in these reverse promoters resulted in increased gene expression in both translational and transcriptional gene fusions. An RNase protection assay revealed that the transcript level of the wild type relative {{to that of the}} <b>reverse</b> promoter <b>mutant</b> at the downstream regions was much lower than the level at the upstream regions. This suggests that these reverse promoter-like elements affect their downstream transcript level. The possible mechanisms of this kind of negative regulation, in addition to their possible biological roles, are discussed...|$|R
