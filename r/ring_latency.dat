40|$|From {{earlier work}} on the {{analysis}} of FDDI protocol, {{we know that they}} separate 1 analyzed either synchronous traffic or asynchronous traffic because of the analytical complexity. However, both sysnchronous and asynchronous traffic are actually correlated; the independent analysis of either one would lose some correctness. In this paper, we present an approach to analyze both traffic simultaneously. Within the approach, we still analyze both queues separately, but correlate them by a pseudo <b>ring</b> <b>latency</b> to reflect the dependencies between the two traffic. An iterative method is used to numerically obtain the state probabilities for both traffic. Also, by a pseudo conservation law, the mean waitin times of both traffic are obtained.

40|$|AbstractWe {{examined}} the effects of changing spatial aspects of attention during oculomotor tracking. Human subjects were instructed to make a discrimination on either the small (0. 8 °) central or the large (8 °) peripheral part of a compound stimulus (two counter-rotating concentric rings) while the stimulus either translated across the screen or was stationary. During this period, a transient perturbation with either step or ramp movement profile occurred. For perturbations leading to a change in position larger than the small ring, saccades occurred more frequently and had much shorter latencies (by 135 ms) when attention was directed to the small ring than when attention was directed to the large <b>ring.</b> These <b>latency</b> differences were sufficiently great that from a single saccade one can identify the attentional instruction with 94 % accuracy. However, with target steps as small as the small <b>ring,</b> saccade <b>latencies</b> differed less. For pursuit, ramp perturbations caused larger changes in eye velocity with little change in latency when attention was directed to the small ring. Finally, when only the motion of the non-attended ring was perturbed, most subjects showed stronger saccadic responses to perturbations of the small than the large ring, and stronger pursuit responses to perturbations of the large than the small ring. By fitting the saccade latency distributions with the Reddi and Carpenter LATER model, we found that our subjects apparently employed at least two distinct strategies for changing latency when attending large vs. small. We propose that the timing of the saccade decision process depends on both the size of the attended object and the magnitude of the perturbation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a compositional approach to formally verify quality-of-service properties of network-on-chip designs. A major challenge to scalability {{is the need}} to verify worst-case latency bounds for hundreds to thousands of cycles, which are beyond the capacity of state-of-the-art model checkers. The scalability challenge is addressed using a compositional model checking approach. The overall latency bound problem is divided into a number of smaller sub-problems, termed latency lemmas. The sub-problems imply the overall latency bound, but are easier to prove on account of being inductive. A method is presented for computing these lemmas based on the topology of the network and a subset of relevant state, and the latency lemmas are verified using k-induction. The effectiveness of this compositional technique is demonstrated on illustrative examples and an industrial ring interconnection network. In the <b>ring</b> network, a <b>latency</b> bound that cannot be verified in 10 000 s without lemmas is proved inductively in just 75 s when the lemmas are used. © 1982 - 2012 IEEE...|$|R
40|$|Information in a Spiking Neural Network (SNN) is encoded as the {{relative}} timing between spikes. Distortion in spike timings can impact {{the accuracy of}} SNN operation by modifying the precise firing time of neurons within the SNN. Maintaining the integrity of spike timings is crucial for reliable operation of SNN applications. A packet switched Network on Chip (NoC) infrastructure offers scalable connectivity for spike communication in hardware SNN architectures. However, shared resources in NoC architectures can result in unwanted variation in spike packet transfer latency. This packet latency jitter distorts the timing information conveyed on the synaptic connections in the SNN, resulting in unreliable application behaviour. This paper presents a SystemC simulation based analysis of the synaptic information distortion in NoC based hardware SNNs. The paper proposes a fixed spike transfer <b>latency</b> <b>ring</b> topology interconnect for spike communication between neural tiles, using a novel timestamped spike broadcast flow control scheme. The proposed architectural technique is evaluated using spike rates employed in previously reported mesh topology NoC based hardware SNN applications, which exhibited spike latency jitter over NoC paths. Results indicate that the proposed interconnect offers fixed spike transfer latency and eliminates the associated information distortion. The paper presents the micro-architecture of the proposed ring router. The FPGA validated ring interconnect architecture has been synthesised using 65 nm low-power CMOS technology. Silicon area comparisons for various ring sizes are presented. Scalability of the proposed architecture has been addressed by employing a hierarchical NoC architecture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The IEEE 802. 5 {{token ring}} {{protocol}} defines eight packet priorities. The intent is that “high priority ” packets should be delivered prior to “low priority ” packets. Through {{a series of}} simulations we show that this expected behavior occurs under {{a unique set of}} circumstances: when there are very few network stations, very short data packets (but still long relative to <b>ring</b> <b>latency),</b> very short token hold times, and very high network load. In the general case, we found that priorities did not markedly influence packet delivery time. Use of the priority system generally resulted in more overhead and longer average packet delays than when all packets were carried as a single priority. We mathematically describe the features of the protocol operation that are the cause of this increased delay and lack of priority discrimination. 50 E 03, I I I I I I I I 1 I.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the concept of}} "a posteriori" access strategy, {{as opposed to the}} previously studied concept of "a priori" strategy, to provide a fair and ecient access technique in slotted wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) rings under a large variety of trac patterns. Using a posteriori strategies, the source node selects the packet for transmission based {{on the state of the}} WDM channels in the arriving slot, thus adapting the access decision to the instantaneous trac in the various channels. The packet selection process of a posteriori strategies, when contrasted with a priori strategies, yields fair and ecient utilization of the ring bandwidth without requiring the equalization of the <b>ring</b> <b>latency,</b> nor imposing restrictions on the trac patterns allowed in the system. Since the same features cannot be provided by a priori access strategies, a posteriori strategies oers a more versatile access control that justies the higher implementation complexity due to the multi-channel se [...] ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: The pattern ERG {{can be used}} {{to detect}} early glaucomatous change, because the {{response}} of cells in the inner retina from (typically) 20 °– 40 ° of area is reduced before perimetric abnormality is certain. The multifocal pattern electroretinogram (mfPERG) allows analysis of many local regions within this area. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate whether in patients with presumed glaucoma the mfPERG permits diagnosis and discrimination from normals. Methods: Measurements on 25 age-related normal eyes were compared to those on 23 eyes with different stages of glaucoma. A RETIScan system was used to generate a stimulus pattern of 19 hexagons, each consisting of six triangles. The triangles pattern-reversed black to white at 75 Hz. Those 19 hexagons were grouped into three stimulus regions: a central field, a middle, and a peripheral ring. The complete array subtended 48 ° at the eye. The hexagons alternated between black and white, in a temporal pattern that followed a corrected binary m-sequence (length 512, 10 cycles with 39 s each). The amplitudes and latencies of positive responses at approximately 50 ms (P- 50) and negative responses at approximately 95 ms (N- 95) were analyzed. Results: In patients with glaucoma the P- 50 and N- 95 components of the mfPERG were significantly reduced for the central area and both outer rings compared to normal volunteers (p< 0. 001, Mann–Whitney-U). The most distinct reduction was observed for N- 95 and the central <b>ring.</b> Changes in <b>latencies</b> were not conclusive. The reduction of the components increased with the stage of glaucoma. A predictive model for detecting early glaucomatous changes was designed based on P- 50 –N- 95 with 88 % sensitivity and 76 % specificity. Conclusion: In glaucoma a marked reduction of components, especially centrally is observed in the mfPERG. This hints to an early involvement of central ganglion cells and may be useful for future functional tests...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} different stimulus frame rates and check sizes on blue−yellow multifocal visual evoked potentials (mVEP). Methods:  Subjects were examined at the Save Sight Institute at the University Sydney. Experiment 1 involved five adult subjects who underwent binocular stimulation by the Accumap multifocal objective perimeter. The eyes were stimulated with a cortically scaled dartboard pattern consisting of isoluminant blue and yellow checks. These were arranged in three concentric rings extending to an eccentricity of 26 ° in the visual field. The stimulus pattern was driven by binary sequences resulting in pseudorandom binary exchange of two opposite checkerboard patterns at each of the 32 sites in the visual field. The mVEP were recorded at two different rates of display of the pattern stimulus. In experiment 2, mVEP were tested on 10 normal subjects. Each of the 36 stimulation sites contained a checkerboard pattern of 20, 30, 42 or 56 checks/site, the stimulation pattern was displayed at the optimum rate found in experiment 1. The size of the checks was inversely proportional to the number of checks per site. Results: In experiment 1, the slow frame rate significantly increased the average amplitude throughout the field tested by 50 ± 10. 1 % (P = 0. 001). Latency was significantly shortened by 6. 3 % (P < 0. 01). In experiment 2, the average amplitude peaked at 30 checks per segment; however, this was only calculated to be significantly different from the smallest check size (Fcrit range 4, 27 = 0. 09 P < 0. 05, anova, Tukey's T method). A similar difference was found in ring 1 (Fcrit range 4, 27 = 0. 09, P < 0. 05, anova, Tukey's T method). In ring 2, however, there was also a significant difference between 56 checks and 20, 30 and 42 (Fcrit range 4, 27 = 0. 09, anova, P < 0. 05). Altering the check sizes did not significantly affect the amplitudes in <b>ring</b> 3. The <b>latencies</b> were not significantly modified by altering check size at any eccentricity. Conclusions:  These findings suggest that slowing the stimulation rate and displaying 30 checks per stimulation segment optimizes the blue−yellow mVEP stimulus. 5 page(s...|$|R
