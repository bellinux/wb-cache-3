5|$|Though most of {{the routes}} {{proposed}} over the decades have never seen construction, discussion <b>remains</b> <b>strong</b> to develop some of these lines, to alleviate existing subway capacity constraints and overcrowding, the most notable being the proposals for the Second Avenue Subway. Plans for new lines {{date back to the}} early 1910s, and expansion plans have been proposed during many years of the system's existence.|$|E
5|$|Basil Mitchell {{responded to}} Flew's falsification {{principle}} {{with his own}} parable. He described an underground resistance soldier who meets a stranger who claims to be leading the resistance movement. The stranger tells the soldier to keep faith in him, {{even if he is}} seen to be fighting for the other side. The soldier's faith is regularly tested as he observes the stranger fighting for both sides, but his faith <b>remains</b> <b>strong.</b> Mitchell's parable teaches that although evidence can challenge a religious belief, a believer still has reason to hold their views. He argued that although a believer will not allow anything to count decisively against his beliefs, the theist still accepts the existence of evidence which could count against religious belief.|$|E
50|$|Changes in {{bathymetry}} {{can affect}} the strength of an upwelling. For example, a submarine ridge that extends out from the coast will produce more favorable upwelling conditions than neighboring regions. Upwelling typically begins at such ridges and <b>remains</b> <b>strongest</b> at the ridge even after developing in other locations.|$|R

5|$|There {{have been}} {{speakers}} of Goidelic languages in the Inner Hebrides {{since the time}} of Columba or before, and the modern variant of Scottish Gaelic (Gàidhlig) <b>remains</b> <b>strong</b> in some parts. However, the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 led to generations of Gaels being forbidden to speak their native language in the classroom, and is now recognised as having dealt a major blow to the language. Children were being beaten for speaking Gaelic in school as late as the 1930s. More recently the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act was enacted by the Scottish Parliament in 2005 in order to provide continuing support for the language.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota's {{earliest}} industries were fur {{trading and}} agriculture. The city of Minneapolis grew around the flour mills powered by St. Anthony Falls. Although {{less than one}} percent of the population is now employed in the agricultural sector, it remains a major part of the state's economy, ranking sixth in the nation in the value of products sold. The state is the U.S.'s largest producer of sugar beets, sweet corn, and green peas for processing, and farm-raised turkeys. Minnesota is also a large producer of corn and soybeans. Minnesota has the most food cooperatives per capita in the United States. Forestry <b>remains</b> <b>strong,</b> including logging, pulpwood processing and paper production, and forest products manufacturing. Minnesota was famous for its soft-ore mines, which produced a significant portion of the world's iron ore for over a century. Although the high-grade ore is now depleted, taconite mining continues, using processes developed locally to save the industry. In 2004, the state produced 75 percent of the country's usable iron ore. The mining boom created the port of Duluth which continues to be important for shipping ore, coal, and agricultural products. The manufacturing sector now includes technology and biomedical firms in addition to the older food processors and heavy industry. The nation's first indoor shopping mall was Edina's Southdale Center and its largest is Bloomington's Mall of America.|$|E

5000|$|... the Norman {{language}} <b>remains</b> <b>strongest</b> in {{the less}} accessible areas of the former Duchy of Normandy: the Channel Islands and the Cotentin Peninsula (Cotentinais) in the west, and the Pays de Caux (Cauchois dialect) in the east. Ease of access from Paris and {{the popularity of the}} coastal resorts of central Normandy, such as Deauville, in the 19th century led to a significant loss of distinctive Norman culture in the central low-lying areas of Normandy.|$|R

25|$|Lowell's {{influence}} on science fiction <b>remains</b> <b>strong.</b> The canals figure prominently in Red Planet by Robert A. Heinlein (1949) and The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury (1950).

25|$|Classics, in the Western {{academic}} tradition, {{refer to}} the studies of the cultures of classical antiquity, namely Ancient Greek and Latin and the Ancient Greek and Roman cultures.

British influence <b>remains</b> <b>strong,</b> with English being the language of government, commerce, education and the media.|$|E
25|$|The {{links between}} the two nations <b>remains</b> <b>strong,</b> and the fact that for the last two centuries a great number of Montenegrins had emigrated to Serbia further {{strengthens}} the ties. The Montenegrin littoral is still the main turistic destination for citizens of Serbia, and a large population of Serbians own property in Montenegro. Many of these properties consist of summer homes, and contribute to a seasonal influx of Serbs in Montenegro, during the summers. Despite the geopolitical separation, the economic balance and relationship shared between the two countries continues to be strong.|$|E

25|$|So far, {{there is}} no {{scholarly}} consensus yet about what the overall long-term effect will be of environmental pollution on the average rate of profit for industries. In some cases, if a resource is depleted (and therefore much more difficult and costly to obtain), the profit yield on producing the resource might fall, since people will only buy {{it up to a}} certain price point. In other cases, if an essential resource becomes scarce, its owners can drive up the price, and thus increase their profit rate, because demand <b>remains</b> <b>strong.</b>|$|E
25|$|Sentiments toward {{mandatory}} Swedish vary. Many prominent politicians (both Finnish- and Swedish-speaking) wholeheartedly support mandatory Swedish in schools, {{while others}} oppose it. There {{have been numerous}} petitions and other similar campaigns arranged by some small but dedicated organizations to pressure the lawmakers to abolish mandatory Swedish, but to date, they have had no {{significant impact on the}} established policy. Thus, while the ongoing debate is often heated and passionate, the support for mandatory Swedish tuition <b>remains</b> <b>strong</b> enough among politicians for the government not to consider a change of policy.|$|E
