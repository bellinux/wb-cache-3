500|$|Some {{brand and}} {{marketing}} experts {{have come out}} {{in support of the}} name change. Nigel Currie, director of sports marketing agency Brand Rapport, stated that [...] "the whole process has been conducted badly with the supporters, but [...] is a pretty sound idea." [...] Simon Chadwick, professor of Sport Business Strategy and Marketing at the Coventry University Business School, opined that the objective of opening up lucrative new markets for shirt sales, merchandise and broadcast deals shows commercial vision and could bring benefits, but [...] "this needs to be backed up by a proper marketing strategy and investment." [...] He said, [...] "it's no use thinking changing the name or the colour of the shirt will pay instant dividends." [...] David Stern, commissioner of the National Basketball Association in the United States, warned: [...] "I would say a wise owner [...] would view his ownership as something of a public trust, in addition to the profit motive, and you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> allow the fans a little bit more input than I think is being allowed, with respect to Hull." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{felt the}} {{question}} was a mistake as he was uttering it. Your really injured innocent would have called all the elements to witness {{that he was a}} millionaire. But {{it was too late to}} try that now. And, besides, he <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know how Mr Thompson had got to hear of this skeleton in his cupboard.|$|R
5000|$|The {{novel was}} a {{moderate}} success and received critical praise. The San Francisco Chronicle {{called it a}} [...] "darkly eerie and winning new novel", and The New York Times wrote that the novel [...] "provides gratifyingly exact and telling portraits of the kids themselves. Solid plotting guarantees that the reader <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> learn who wins when the ballots are finally counted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "First and {{foremost}} commenced," [...] Mr. Clodd, as he laid aside his hat, [...] "it is quite understood that you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{get rid of}} him? What's that?" [...] demanded Mr. Clodd, a heavy thud upon the floor above having caused him to start out of his chair.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} {{blame you for}} {{watching}} them, Rover. After {{what happened to you}} and your Cousin Fred, it is no more than right that you should be on your guard. Yet, I trust that you will give Brown and Martell a chance to prove themselves, provided they <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> turn over a new leaf and make amends for what has happened." ...|$|E

I <b>really</b> <b>DO</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see things in their entirety, with their beauty left to them, and their wholeness, their natural holiness. Don't you feel it, don't you feel you CAN'T be tortured into any more knowledge?' said Hermione, stopping in front of Ursula, and turning to her with clenched fists thrust downwards.|$|E
5000|$|The show soon {{planned a}} {{break-up}} {{for the two}} characters. They played Zack being unfaithful with family friend Joanne Cardsley (Rachel Leskovac) and Theresa catches them together. Boachie branded his character [...] "devastated" [...] to have been caught with Joanne. Zack had never <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> be the type of man who cheated on their partner. So [...] "he <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> make it work with her, but his apologies get him no where." [...] Theresa then threatens to tell everyone that he has slept with Joanne.|$|R

6000|$|... "Julia Thurnbrein!" [...] Elisabeth exclaimed. [...] "Yes, I {{have read}} them. If only I {{had known that}} that was she! I should have liked so much to have talked to her. Do you think that she would come and see me, or let me come and see her? We <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> {{understand}} these things, {{and it seems to}} me, somehow, that people like Julia Thurnbrein, and all those who really understand, keep away from us wilfully. They won't exchange thoughts. They believe that we are their natural enemies. And we aren't, you know. There isn't any one I'd like to meet and talk with so much as Julia Thurnbrein." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For this once," [...] she entreated. [...] "You must {{remember}} that mamma often {{looked at me with}} hatred, and said I was the cause of all her woe; but sometimes in her last months she would give me such sad looks that I trembled, and I felt that she was picturing me growing into the kind of woman she wished so much she had not become herself, and that she longed to save me. That is why I have told her that a good man loves me. She is so glad, my poor dear mamma, that I tell her again and again, and she loves to hear it as much as I to tell it. What she loves to hear most is that you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> marry me. She is so fond of hearing that because it is what my father would never say to her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Will you {{pardon me}} if I {{pause for a}} moment to put what I fear you may think an impertinent question? I never can go on with an address unless I feel, or know, that my {{audience}} are either with me or against me: I do not much care which, in beginning; but I must know where they are; and I would fain find out, at this instant, whether you think I am putting the motives of popular action too low. I am resolved, to-night, to state them low enough to be admitted as probable; for whenever, in my writings on Political Economy, I assume that a little honesty, or generosity,--or {{what used to be called}} [...] "virtue,"--may be calculated upon as a human motive of action, people always answer me, saying, [...] "You must not calculate on that: that is not in human nature: you must not assume anything to be common to men but acquisitiveness and jealousy; no other feeling ever has influence on them, except accidentally, and in matters out of the way of business." [...] I begin, accordingly, tonight low in the scale of motives; but I must know if you think me right in doing so. Therefore, let me ask those who admit the love of praise to be usually the strongest motive in men's minds in seeking advancement, and the honest desire of doing any kind of duty to be an entirely secondary one, to hold up their hands. (About a dozen hands held up--the audience, partly, not being sure the lecturer is serious, and, partly, shy of expressing opinion.) I am quite serious--I <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know what you think; however, I can judge by putting the reverse question. Will those who think that duty is generally the first, and love of praise the second, motive, hold up their hands? (One hand reported to have been held up behind the lecturer.) Very good: I see you are with me, and that you think I have not begun too near the ground. Now, without teasing you by putting farther question, I venture to assume that you will admit duty as at least a secondary or tertiary motive. You think that the desire of doing something useful, or obtaining some real good, is indeed an existent collateral idea, though a secondary one, in most men's desire of advancement. You will grant that moderately honest men desire place and office, at least in some measure for the sake of beneficent power; and would wish to associate rather with sensible and well-informed persons than with fools and ignorant persons, whether they are seen in the company of the sensible ones or not. And finally, without being troubled by repetition of any common truisms about the preciousness of friends, and the influence of companions, you will admit, doubtless, that according to the sincerity of our desire that our friends may be true, and our companions wise,--and in proportion to the earnestness and discretion with which we choose both,--will be the general chances of our happiness and usefulness.|$|E

50|$|Jack {{ended up}} finding the missing key and helping Steve find Kayla, {{who had been}} kidnapped by Victor Kiriakis (who also wanted the key, since he had been searching for it for years). This finally brought Jack {{together}} with Steve, and although {{his relationship with his}} family was still on shaky legs, Jack was asked to be Steve's best man at his remarriage to Kayla, who was also struggling to accept the reformed Jack. During the Key incident, Jack had tried hard to persuade Kayla not to leave Steve, and Kayla had finally realized that Jack <b>really</b> <b>did</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> help bring Steve and Kayla together.|$|R
5000|$|Price {{avoided the}} term African American, preferring to call herself an American, even a [...] "chauvinistic American". She summed up her {{philosophy}} thus: [...] "If {{you are going}} to think black, think positive about it. Don't think down on it, or think it is something in your way. And this way, when you <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> stretch out, and express how beautiful black is, everybody will hear you." ...|$|E
5000|$|Friedman concludes: “How {{we manage}} the {{aftermath}} of the Iraq story and what kind of peace we try to construct out there will determine who wins: the mountains of suspicious, the rivers of rage, or the voices of moderation who <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> partner with us Americans.” Ali Salem observes that “God didn’t create us to die, but to live. In order to survive and thrive as a civilization, we must live in accordance with others. We cannot live alone”. In “An Apology from an Arab,” Salem concedes that Arab society may be temporarily backwards, but they are no different from the Americans. They too love freedom, and want a chance at a decent life.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The Universal Ballet company's {{first tour}} in the United States was in 1998. Julia Moon said {{that the company is}} {{separate}} from Sun Myung Moon, and that only herself and one other member are also members of the Unification Church. Approximately half of the administrative staff, headed by her father, Bo Hi Pak, one of Rev. Moon's chief aides, belong to the Unification Church. She said the company does not perform modern ballet styles, due to her view that the [...] "classical form is the most beautiful form and therefore that's where our background is". She commented that she would like for the company to move in the direction of more contemporary pieces, [...] "We <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> know more of these contemporary modern works. I think we're ready for it. We need to expand artistically in that area, as well as keeping parallel with the classical tradition." ...|$|E

5000|$|In {{its first}} year on the {{struggling}} ABC network, the show was up against Milton Berle's popular Texaco Star Theater and Reed ratings were low. ABC nearly cancelled the show, but it was renewed and ratings improved when the show was moved from Wednesday to Thursday nights. The series flourished {{for the next seven}} years, but made television's top 25 only in 1963-1964. In a 1964 interview, Reed said, [...] "We have proved on our show that the public <b>really</b> <b>does</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> see a healthy woman, not a girl, not a neurotic, not a sexpot...I am so fed up with immature 'sex' and stories about kooky, amoral, sick women." ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{psychology}} of unconscious racial prejudiceThe interest in sustainability {{also meant that}} he became interested in possible ‘dissociation’ {{in other areas of}} life and he explored this in the area of unconscious racial prejudice especially in the context of shortlisting for academic posts. Beattie showed that when White people were shortlisting candidates for jobs, they were ten times more likely to select two White candidates than two non-White candidates (despite the White and non-White candidates having identical CVs) and, in addition, using remote eye tracking to monitor their individual gaze fixation points, he found that those doing the shortlisting unconsciously fixated on the weaker parts of the CV of candidates from different racial backgrounds to themselves. One consequence of this selective attention, directed by the unconscious system, is that the final outcome might appear quite reasonable and might well satisfy our conscious and rational self.Beattie has argued that if we <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> do anything about racism in society, then we need to understand these implicit, unconscious processes and how to combat them. The research is reported in ‘Our Racist Heart? An Exploration of Unconscious Prejudice in Everyday Life’ (Routledge, 2013) and was funded by Equality and Diversity at the University of Manchester [...] and then by the U.K.’s Equality Challenge Unit.|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing Capital for The Daily Telegraph, Keith Miller {{gave it a}} full five {{stars and}} began by writing, [...] "The first thing to say about John Lanchester is that a {{sizeable}} number of concerned economic illiterates have him and none other to thank for whatever portion of their sanity they managed {{to hang on to}} when the banking system went south in the late 2000s. His journalism in the London Review of Books and elsewhere and his book Whoops! explained roughly {{what was going on in}} terms that even a humanities graduate could understand … Lanchester’s was an intelligent, humorous and eminently reasonable voice among all the gibbering. If there’s a knighthood going spare by any chance, he should get it nem con". He found the book to be, [...] "a more or less unimpeachably plausible portrait of one (fictional) street in Clapham, a popular south London 'village' where a spacious but fairly hideous Victorian house can command a price approaching a hundred times the UK's median annual income". Miller warned against the [...] "obvious-seeming parallels with Dickens" [...] finding instead, [...] "A more credible parallel is with Honoré de Balzac: like Balzac, Lanchester has the brains to relate the particular to the general; the ruthlessness to make bad things happen to good people (though good people are in short supply in Capital); the steadiness of hand to draw unpalatable conclusions (poor immigrants really do despise affluent white Londoners; some of our neighbours <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> blow us up; we fall in love with our nannies not because they are younger and prettier than our wives but because they're kinder-hearted and more companionable); and, crucially, the courage to bore his readers a little, at times, rather than leave them underinformed". Miller noted Lanchester's avoidance of moralising but concluded by saying, [...] "Yet some of the book's 'lessons' … seem a shade limited: limiting, even".|$|E

40|$|One lesson I've {{learned is}} that this is a process; it does not change students' writing overnight. But if you make it a {{continuous}} effort and incorporate it in all the writing you complete, the students will slowly develop their writing skills and their writing will improve. The most valuable lesson I {{learned is that}} students <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> be successful and can rise to a challenge. (Mrs. Buff, eighth grade ELA teacher) In the fall of 2005 the principal and teachers at Knickerbacker Middle School (KMS) were worried. KMS was a "School in Good Standing " but had not hit federal or state benchmarks because of low subgroup scores on the English Language Arts (ELA) test—especially scores received by economically disadvantaged students, about half of this urban school's student population. KMS would be identified as a "School in Need of Improvement " in 2006 if the ELA scores did not improve.

40|$|Professional historians {{tend to be}} {{ambivalent}} {{about one of the}} prime historical phenomena of our time: the desire to commemorate. The amount of attention given to memory (collective or not) and trauma bears witness to the fact that historians <b>really</b> <b>do</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> give in to that desire; the fact that they treat these subjects in a rather "positivist" way suggests that they regard it as a bit improper to do so wholeheartedly. As a result commemoration is all over the place but is never taken as seriously as it should be. This essay argues that effective commemoration should start with a question Giambattista Vico might have asked: "who are we that this could have happened ?" Posing this question means relinquishing the identity-enhancing, self-celebrating stance from which we tend to commemorate "unimaginable" events. Commemorative self-exploration is a confrontation with what we don't like to be confronted with: the fact that occasionally we behave in utter contradiction to what we regard as our identity. Heterodox, "monstrous," and therefore Gedachtnisfahig behavior comes in three varieties: things we are proud of, things we are ashamed of, and the sublime "mutations" in which we "commit" history and embark on the unimaginable. Because sublime mutations change consciousness, commemorating them confronts posterity with almost insuperable epistemological difficulties. Commemorating sublime mutations means burying them-not in the sense of "covering" them, but in the sense of "inventing" a way in which they keep on living...|$|E
40|$|Zoomerang {{has over}} 2 million {{registered}} individuals (referred to as Zoompanel). Zoomerang profiles its panelists on over 500 attributes and provides incentives to the panelists {{for their participation}} in surveys. Zoomerang (2009) reports that their panelists represent the U. S. census. In fact, they claim that their random selection of panelists would provide a nationally representative sample {{as opposed to a}} random convenience sample. Individuals that participate in Zoomerang’s research have double opted into the panel to provide opinions. Double opt-in implies that panelists sign up and then are given a chance to back out of the panel (making sure that they <b>really</b> <b>DO</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> participate). For their opinions and time, the panelists are provided with incentive points for each survey that they complete. This is not dissimilar to the incentives often given to complete an instrument in traditional academic mail surveys where mailings are made to a directory (sample frame) of participants. We report that data collected using Zoompanel provides greater control because “inclusion criterion ” could be developed in terms of screening questions to ensure sample frame requirements are met. For example, if a study’s sample requirements are IT managers working in nonprofit organizations in the northeast, it could be achieved by developing appropriate screening questions. Based on the information stored on each panelist, Zoomerang sends invitations to a nationally representative random sample, and the screening questions developed by researchers specific to their studies ensure that the final sample obtained is random and meets the sample frame requirements. Since the present research studies the impact of ICTs on individuals, the sample frame is not constrained to any particular occupation. To truly understand the impact of ICTs on individuals in work settings, some key attributes of the population are desired (i. e., individuals should b...|$|E
