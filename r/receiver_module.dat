40|$|Abstract — Existence of line {{of sight}} (LOS) and perfect {{alignment}} between the communicating modules {{is one of the}} key requirements for free space optical communication. To ensure uninterrupted data flow, auto-aligning transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>modules</b> are necessary. We propose a new approach based on spherically shaped transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>modules</b> (optical antenna) for maintaining optical links even when the two modules are in relative motion. The spherical optical antenna provides angular diversity in 3 -dimensions, and hence provides a {{line of sight}} at any orientation as long as there are no obstacles between the two communicating modules. To demonstrate the proof-of-concept, we designed and tested an auto-configurable circuit integrated with light sources and detectors placed on spherical surfaces. Communication between a stationary and a mobile optical antenna has been demonstrated...|$|R

50|$|An RF <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> {{receives}} the modulated RF signal, and demodulates it. There {{are two types}} of RF receiver modules: superheterodyne receivers and super-regenerative receivers. Super-regenerative modules are usually low cost and low power designs using a series of amplifiers to extract modulated data from a carrier wave. Super-regenerative modules are generally imprecise as their frequency of operation varies considerably with temperature and power supply voltage. Superheterodyne receivers have a performance advantage over super-regenerative; they offer increased accuracy and stability over a large voltage and temperature range. This stability comes from a fixed crystal design which in the past tended to mean a comparatively more expensive product. However, advances in receiver chip design now mean that currently there is little price difference between superheterodyne and super-regenerative receiver modules.|$|E

Although the 14th Institute had previously successfully developed solid state L-band transceivers, the new S-band with shorter wavelength presented greater challenge in that the new transceiver must be more compact and more resistant to interference. The 14th Institute formed a project team to develop the new transceiver, with the following members: designer of the circulator is Zhang Fu-Qiong (张福琼), assisted by Mo Jia-Ming (莫家铭).

40|$|The VirA protein of Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a transmembrane sensory kinase that phosphorylates the VirG {{response}} regulator {{in response}} to chemical signals released from plant wound sites. VirA contains both a two-component kinase module and, at its carboxyl terminus, a <b>receiver</b> <b>module.</b> We previously provided evidence that this <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> inhibited {{the activity of the}} kinase module and that inhibition might be neutralized by phosphorylation. In this report, we provide additional evidence for this model by showing that overexpressing the <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> in trans can restore low-level basal activity to a VirA mutant protein lacking the <b>receiver</b> <b>module.</b> We also show that ablation of the <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> restores activity to the inactive VirA (delta 324 - 413) mutant, which has a deletion within a region designated the linker module. This indicates that deletion of the linker module does not denature the kinase module, but rather locks the kinase into a phenotypically inactive conformation, and that this inactivity requires the <b>receiver</b> <b>module.</b> These data provide genetic evidence that the kinase and receiver modules of VirA attain their native conformations autonomously. The <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> also restricts the variety of phenolic compounds that have stimulatory activity, since removal of this module causes otherwise nonstimulatory phenolic compounds such as 4 -hydroxyacetophenone to stimulate vir gene expression...|$|E

40|$|During signal transduction, {{response}} regulators of two-component {{systems are}} phosphorylated in a conserved <b>receiver</b> <b>module.</b> Phosphorylation induces {{activation of the}} non-conserved output domain. We fused various domains of the response regulators NtrC, PhoB or CheB to the DNA binding domain of lambda repressor. Analysis of these hybrid proteins shows that the receiver modules of NtrC and PhoB are potential dimerization domains. In the unphosphorylated proteins, {{the ability of the}} receiver modules to dimerize is masked due to inhibition by their output domains. Inhibition can be relieved in two ways: phosphorylation of the <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> or deletion of the output domain. In contrast, the <b>receiver</b> <b>module</b> of CheB lacks this ability for dimerization. We propose a model which groups response regulators into two classes. Common to both classes is the interaction between receiver and output domain in the unphosphorylated protein. In class I (e. g. NtrC and PhoB), this interaction leads to the inhibition of the <b>receiver</b> <b>module.</b> Phosphorylation relieves inhibition, thereby inducing activation via dimerization of the receiver modules. In class II (e. g. CheB), the interaction between receiver and output domain results in inhibition of the output domain.
