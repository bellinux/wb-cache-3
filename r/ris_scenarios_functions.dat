40|$|Abstract. In what {{psychological}} {{state are}} requirements for a software model determined? It {{is thought that}} the state must be existent in the incomprehensible depths of our consciousness. The state is only one as a whole. This subject defines it as an intent. The action that produces a requirement or the action that determines it is dispatched from an intent. In that sense, a requirement reflects an intent. The reflection means the objectification. For example, the expression in language means it. However, its scheme which is implemented as a phenomenon of life shall become none {{of which is the}} same. On the basis of the aforementioned assumption, this subject pursues a standpoint of grasping an intent but not of grasping a requirement. For this sake, hypotheses are accumulated. From the said hypothesis, the rule of theorem is sought, and, by using it, an intent is sought. <b>Scenario</b> <b>Function</b> is what was given its concrete form. The work to define the <b>Scenario</b> <b>Function</b> replaces so-called traditional software development itself. The definition can be implemented with the work procedure of determinism. This represents qualifications of the methodology of software development. Related achievements are already available, too. In observing the state of the work, it is undoubtedly effective, when compared with the traditional standpoint. It is thought that it is because of the rationality of the hypothesis of this subject. The purpose of this subject is to describe the overview of the <b>Scenario</b> <b>Function</b> and its hypothesis and publicise that such thinking can be established. ...|$|R

40|$|FPGA {{chips in}} {{reconfigurable}} computer systems {{are used as}} malleable coprocessors where components of a hardware library of functions can be configured as needed. As the number of hardware functions to be configured typically exceeds the underlying chip area during the execution of an application, previous efforts have introduced configuration caching. Those efforts, however, have focused on two run-time-reconfiguration scenarios, which consider a single application running on the reconfigurable system. In the full reconfiguration <b>scenario,</b> <b>functions</b> of an application are arranged into blocks {{each of which has}} enough functions to fill the entire chip. The blocks are configured in a deterministic sequence needed by the application based on the a priori knowledge about the application. In the partial reconfiguration <b>scenario,</b> each <b>function</b> is configured or replaced on a function-by-function basis, based on the application needs. In the former technique, spatial processing locality is well exploited. In the latter, only temporal processing locality is exploited. In this work, we propose a technique suitable for multitasking and for cases of single applications that can change the course of processing in a non-deterministic fashion based on data. In order to exploit processing locality, both spatial and temporal simultaneously, the proposed model groups hardware functions into hardware configuration blocks (pages) of fixed size, where multiple pages can be configured on a chip simultaneously. By grouping only related functions that are typically requested together, processing spatial locality can be exploited. Temporal locality is exploited through page replacement techniques. Data mining techniques were used to group related functions into pages. Standard, replacement algorithms as those found in caching were considered. Simulations, as well as emulation using the Cray XD 1 reconfigurable high-performance computer were used in the experimental study. The results show a significant improvement in performance using the proposed paging technique. 1...|$|R
40|$|The plant {{glutamate}} metabolism (GM) plays {{a pivotal}} role in amino acid metabolism and orchestrates crucial metabolic functions with key roles in plant defense against pathogens. These functions concern three major areas: nitrogen transportation via the GS/GOGAT cycle, cellular redox regulation, and TCA cycle-dependent energy reprogramming. During interactions with pathogens the host GM is markedly altered leading to either a metabolic state, termed as ‘endurance’, in which cell viability is maintained; or to an opposite metabolic state, termed as ‘evasion’, in which the process of cell death is facilitated. It seems that endurance-natured modulations result in resistance to necrotrophic pathogens and susceptibility to biotrophs, whereas evasion-related reconfigurations lead to resistance to biotrophic pathogens, but stimulate the infection by necrotrophs. Pathogens, however, have evolved strategies, such as toxin secretion, hemibiotrophy and selective amino acid utilization, to exploit the plant GM to their own benefit. Collectively, it seems that alterations in the host GM in response to different pathogenic <b>scenarios</b> <b>function</b> in two opposing ways, either backing the ongoing defense strategy to ultimately shape an efficient resistance response, or being exploited by the pathogen to promote and facilitate infection...|$|R

40|$|Nevertheless, {{learning}} through experience {{can sometimes be}} difficult, particularly when a long time-span elapses between action and results (Bood and Postma, 1997). Precisely, the scenario approach is presented as the ad hoc tool to address wicked problems (complex, LT, multi actors, mutli- level, etc. - Swart et al, 2004) and foster learning (see among other Korte and Chermack, 2007).

40|$|Thanks {{to recent}} {{technology}} related to product monitoring and data communication, {{it is now}} possible for a company to gather various kinds of product usage data during its operation in a ubiquitous way. However, the application of the newly gathered data is still vague and immature. If the data is transformed into appropriate information or knowledge, {{it would be possible to}} improve products through design modification, maintenance enhancement, elaborate end-of-life decision and so on. This article deals with the application of product usage data to support design modification. Design modification can be achieved by finding and fixing defective design parameters and affecting factors. This done by a complex procedure which is composed of several steps including diverse data processing technique such as function structure model, degradation <b>scenario,</b> <b>function</b> performance degradation evaluation, clustering and relation matrix. The proposed method assesses the status of working product, classifies the field data (i. e. working environment/operation) according to the status and identifies suspicious field data causing the poor working status. Then, the suspicious field data is correlated with design parameters; thus highly defective design parameters can be identified. For the product improvement, the defective design parameters should be reviewed and modified with a high priority. The proposed method is validated by a case study on a locomotive braking system. This work shows the possibility to transform product usage data into information for product improvement, which can serve as a guideline for product usage data application for other product improvement through product usage data. close...|$|R

40|$|Environmentally {{extended}} multi-regional input-output (EE-MRIO) models {{provide us}} with a wealth of data relating to consumption-based environmental impacts at a national level. The results can identify the categories of consumption and sectors of production that contribute most to environmental impact allowing policy makers to prioritise intervention into particular areas. However, these data are not readily accessible to policy makers and civil society, making it difficult to extract and communicate the important messages it contains. The web-based tool - EUREAPA - was created as a usable, task-oriented interface to improve access to environmental and economic data held within a complex EE-MRIO model and make it more relevant to policy makers and civil society. The project team of scientists and IT specialists used an iterative, agile and participatory approach to engage potential end-users in the specification and testing of the tool. The engagement process identified two principal functions that were essential for the EUREAPA tool: viewing data and creating scenarios. The viewing data function allows users to analyse the wealth of data held within the model and present results from a range of perspectives. This helps to understand the causes of environmental pressure and identify priorities for policy intervention. The <b>scenario</b> <b>function</b> helps to communicate how changes in consumption and production might affect the future environmental impact of citizens of the EU, and facilitates long-term planning. Through this dialogue process the project has been able to ensure EUREAPA is relevant, user-friendly and fit-for-purpose.
