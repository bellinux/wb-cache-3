Various initiatives are in train towards achieving this aim including the development of activities that benefit the wider community, challenge prejudice and encourage tolerance of diversity.

5|$|Early Lingbao ritual {{was mostly}} done on an {{individual}} basis, either in a meditation chamber, or the courtyard of a house. Early practitioners were not professional priests, but rather 'students of the Dao'. Later on, as the Lingbao movement developed <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> and an established clergy, ritual practice became more of a communal rite.|$|E
5|$|In {{the medieval}} period some <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> {{displayed}} ancient Greek coins {{of the island}} of Rhodes as specimens of the Thirty Pieces of Silver. The obverses of these coins showed a facing head of the sun god Helios, with rays projecting around {{the upper part of}} it. These rays were interpreted as a representation of the Crown of Thorns.|$|E

50|$|The name Neustift appears for {{the first}} time in an {{official}} document of 1330.

5|$|The 27-year war can {{be divided}} roughly into three periods of major {{fighting}} – from 1975 to 1991, 1992 to 1994, and from 1998 to 2002 – broken up by fragile periods of peace. By the time the MPLA finally achieved victory in 2002, more than 500,000 people had died and over one million had been internally displaced. The war devastated Angola's infrastructure, and severely damaged the nation's public administration, economic enterprises, and <b>religious</b> <b>institutions.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Catholic Church, {{also known}} as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.29billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> in the world, it has played a {{prominent}} role in the history and development of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the Pope, the church's doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. Its central administration, the Holy See, is in the Vatican City, enclaved within Rome, Italy.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Saint Andrew {{may have}} come to Pictland from Northumbria, as had the cult of Saint Peter which had been favoured by Nechtan, and in {{particular}} from the monastery at Hexham which was dedicated to Saint Andrew. This apparent connection with the Northumbrian church may have left a written record. Óengus, like his successors and possible kinsmen Caustantín and Eógan, is recorded prominently in the Liber Vitae Ecclesiae Dunelmensis, a list of some 3000 benefactors for whom prayers were said in <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> connected with Durham.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} medieval European clockmakers were Christian monks. Medieval <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> required clocks {{because they}} regulated daily prayer- and work-schedules strictly, using {{various types of}} time-telling and recording devices, such as water clocks, sundials and marked candles, probably in combination. When mechanical clocks came into use, they were often wound {{at least twice a}} day to ensure accuracy. Monasteries broadcast important times and durations with bells, rung either by hand or by a mechanical device, such as by a falling weight or by rotating beater.|$|E

[...] But the AAUP's Committee A did not endorse it, thus the issue on whether a <b>religious</b> <b>institution</b> can place limits on academic freedom if those limitations are clearly stated appears to be unresolved.|$|R

As a general rule, cemeteries, birthplaces, graves of historical figures, properties owned by <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> or used for religious purposes, moved structures, reconstructed historic buildings, commemorative properties, and properties that have achieved significance during {{the last fifty years}} are not qualified for listing on the Register. There are, however, exceptions to all the preceding; mitigating circumstances allow properties classified in one of those groups to be included.|$|E

In keeping with the racial transformation, the cultural and <b>religious</b> <b>institutions,</b> including those of Irish Catholics, Greek Orthodoxy and the Jewish faith, converted to African American institutions. The DuSable Museum of African American History, founded in 1961, moved to Washington Park in 1973.

5|$|The Reformation brought Roskilde's {{development}} {{to an abrupt}} stop. While the cathedral continued to be the preferred location for the entombment of the Danish monarchs, {{most of the other}} <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> disappeared. For the next three centuries, the city suffered a series of disasters including the effects of the Dano-Swedish War which terminated with the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658, the plague in 1710 and 1711, and a series of fires in 1730. Conditions improved in 1835 when the city became the Assembly of the Estates of the Realm (Rådgivende Stænderforsamling) and in 1847 with the railway connecting Copenhagen and Roskilde.|$|E
5|$|The city's {{population}} {{became more}} diverse {{after the end}} of World War II, when a seemingly robust steel industry attracted thousands of workers. In the 1950s, the Latino population grew significantly; and by the 1970s, St. Rose of Lima Roman Catholic Church and the First Spanish Baptist Church of Ohio were among the largest <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> for Spanish-speaking residents in the Youngstown metropolitan area. While diversity is among the community's enduring characteristics, the industrial economy that drew various groups to the area collapsed in the late 1970s. In response to subsequent challenges, the city has taken well-publicized steps to diversify economically, while building on some traditional strengths.|$|E
5|$|Castro's {{government}} diversified {{its economy}} into biotechnology and tourism, the latter outstripping Cuba's sugar industry as its {{primary source of}} revenue in 1995. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash. Economic hardship led many Cubans toward religion, both {{in the form of}} Roman Catholicism and Santería. Although long thinking religious belief to be backward, Castro softened his approach to <b>religious</b> <b>institutions</b> and religious people were permitted {{for the first time to}} join the Communist Party. Although he viewed the Roman Catholic Church as a reactionary, pro-capitalist institution, Castro organized a visit to Cuba by Pope John Paul II for January 1998; it strengthened the position of both the Cuban Church and Castro's government.|$|E

If an association with a religious nature fails to register with the Ministry, its representative is reminded of the requirement to do so. If the representative does not comply, the place of worship or association is instructed to close down. Although {{the representative of the}} <b>religious</b> <b>institution</b> or association can be jailed for 6 months to 5 years for failing to comply with these instructions, during the reporting period no representative received this penalty.|$|R
