Much work has been carr ied out to improve the charac-ter ist ics of this e lectrode wi th in the f ramework {{of the need to}} improve the battery in general (1). One of the most signif icant improvements in the last decade has been the reduct ion in the ant imony level f rom 14 % and u l t imate ly the rep lacement of ant imony as the main grid al loying ingredient. Modern nonant imon ia] alloys employ Ca and Sn as the added ingredients, whereas low anti-monia] alloys general ly conta in less than 2 % Sb. Lead-ant imony alloys have tradit ional ly been used to improve hardness, strength, and castabi l i ty of the battery grids. It has also been found that ant imony addi t ions to the posit ive grid extends the service life of the battery by improv ing the capabi l i ty to resist deep cycl ing (2). However, ant imony does have a pr ime e lectrochemical d isadvantage. Under anodic attack of the grid, dur ing overcharge, ant imony can pass into solut ion (in the + 5 ox idat ion state) and be t ransferred to the negat ive grid, where it is reduced. The ant imony u l t imate ly becomes depos i ted on the e lectrode surface, and, s ince depos i ted ant imony has a lower hydrogen evolut ion potent ia l than lead, gassing occurs at the negat ive electrode wi th subse-quent water loss and self-discharge of the battery. With the advent of sealed "maintenance- f ree " batter ies it has become impor tant to remove ant imony f <b>rom</b> <b>th...</b>|$|E

There has been no report of its presence from northwest coast of India and present note deals with the occurrence of A. nibe (J & T) off Veraval coast of Saura-shtra region. During the routine studies on the biology and fisheries of sciaenid fishes along the Veraval coast, bulk landings of A. nibe (J & T) were noticed in the catches of the trawlers which operated at a depth of 30 - 40 m and 10 - 15 km away from the shore.

Increasing the polarization of the oxygens toward Eu ~+ or Tb ~ § appears to decrease the total binding energies of these ions in the tungstates and molybdates.

40|$|The {{present study}} focuses on {{judicial}} officers coming from Constantinople to Thessalonike in the 11 th century. The {{judge of the}} theme of Thessalonike {{was in charge of}} trying cases in the region. From the second fifth of the 11 th century, however, his jurisdiction was extended to the greater financial and judicial unit of Boleron, Strymon and Thessalonike as well. Lead seals and documents from the archives of the monasteries of Athos prove that many of the krites of Boleron, Strymon and Thessalonike had been previously krites of the velum and judges of the hippodrome who performed their duties in the capital and belonged to the ranks of the “small judges”. These judicial officers tried cases that were referred to them, while they could also function as assessors of the “great” or superior judges of Constantinople, i. e. the droungarios of the vigla, the dikaiodotes, the protoasecretis, the eparchos of the city, the koiaistor and the epi ton kriseon. The latter could delegate the authority to try cases to the “small” or inferior judges. Consequently, the judges of the velum and the judges of the hippodrome could also be sent from Constantinople to the themes by the emperor or other officials, in order to examine some cases and then return to the capital. This is confirmed by the primary sources, which mention for example the case of judge of the hippodrome Michael Rhodios, who was sent by Alexios I Komnenos in 1084 from Constantinople to the region of Thessalonike, in order to examine a dispute between the Lavra monastery and the brother of the emperor, Adrian. Some years later Michael Rhodios was sent again to try cases in Thessalonike, but this time as krites of Boleron, Strymon and Thessalonike. Consequently, apart from the judge of Boleron, Strymon and Thessalonike, other judges delegated by the emperor or by high officers could also examine cases there, as happened in other themes. F <b>rom</b> the 14 <b>th</b> century on, as Macedonia developed its own law schools, a person who had acquired legal training and judicial experience in Thessalonike could continue his judicial career in Constantinople.        </p...|$|R
