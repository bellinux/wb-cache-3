50|$|Break open designs {{work best}} with rimmed {{cartridges}}, which {{can use a}} solid extractor. Rimless cartridges require a spring-loaded extractor, which can slide {{out of the way}} for cartridge insertion, and spring back to engage the <b>recessed</b> <b>rim.</b> While these spring-loaded extractors are found on even inexpensive models, the spring-loaded extractor is not as strong as a solid extractor, and increases the likelihood that failures to extract will occur.|$|E
2500|$|The Order of Zhukov is a [...] wide gilt cross pattée, {{the four}} arms are {{enamelled}} in red with a gilt border with alternating raised and <b>recessed</b> <b>rims</b> giving {{the appearance of}} shields. At the center, a blue enamelled medallion bearing the gold plated silver relief bust of Georgy Zhukov half turned to the right, below him, interlaced laurel and oak branches. Above the bust of Zhukov, the gilded inscription [...] "ГЕОРГИЙ ЖУКОВ" [...] (GEORGY ZHUKOV). Between the cross arms, embossed gilt rays protruding from the center outward forming a [...] wide square with rounded corners. On the otherwise plain reverse, a raised letter [...] "N" [...] and a line for the award serial number.|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} {{award was}} a [...] wide gilt cross pattée, the four arms were enamelled in red with a gilt border with alternating raised and <b>recessed</b> <b>rims</b> giving {{the appearance of}} shields. At the center, a [...] diameter blue enamelled medallion bearing the gold plated silver relief bust of Georgy Zhukov, below him, interlaced laurel and oak branches. Above the bust of Zhukov, the gilded inscription [...] "ГЕОРГИЙ ЖУКОВ" [...] (GEORGY ZHUKOV). Between the cross arms, embossed gilt rays protruding from the center outward forming a [...] wide square with rounded corners. The reverse of the Order had a threaded stud with a nut to secure it to clothing. The Order of Zhukov was worn {{on the right side}} of the chest with other similar orders.|$|R
5000|$|Vivi-Tone {{produced}} guitars, mandolins, {{an electric}} keyboard, {{and at least}} one amplifier. [...] One acoustic guitar design featured a secondary soundboard (the back of the guitar) as well as a primary soundboard (the top of the guitar). This secondary soundboard had f-holes, and was <b>recessed</b> from the <b>rim</b> of the guitar to keep this soundboard away from the player’s body. Another acoustic-electric guitar design from the mid-1930s had essentially a plank body, {{making it one of the}} very early examples of a solid body guitar.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{traditional}} {{squealer tip}} of turbine blade performs good property in decreasing the leakage mass flow rate. The {{improvement of the}} aerodynamic performance for turbine blade tip is always continuing associated with {{the understanding of the}} leakage flowcharacteristic. Thus, a novel turbine blade tip, which is derived from the conventional squealer tip, is investigated numerically in this paper. The characteristic of the tipregion flow field, the tip blade loading distribution and the tip leakage mass flow is analyzed in detail. The results show that, first some part of the tip region flowsare forced to flow downstream along the guided groove formed by the <b>recessed</b> pressure side <b>rim,</b> which contributes to the preventing of the leakage mass flow and the descending of leakage loss as well. Besides,the blade loading of the novel geometry is raised than the traditional squealer tip, which reveals that the mass flow rate of the working fluid is increased. Third, the leakage mass flow is reduced so that the efficiency is increased. The CFD analysis predictsthat, the novel squealer tip case shows 30 % less leakage mass flow and a 0. 11 % total isentropic efficiency increase for a single rotor compared to the baseline squealer tip case...|$|R
