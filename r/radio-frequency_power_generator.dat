40|$|The {{effect of}} <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>powers</b> on the {{properties}} of carbon coatings on optical fibers prepared by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition is investigated. The <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>powers</b> are selected at 150, 200, 250, 300, and 350 W. Results indicate that if the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>power</b> increases from 150 to 350 W, the deposition rate of carbon coatings and carbon grain size increase. As the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>power</b> changes from 150 to 200 W, the water contact angle of carbon coatings increases due to the increase of sp(3) -CHx bonding. Alternatively, as the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>power</b> increases from 200 to 350 W, the water contact angle of carbon coatings gradually reduces which is resulted from the increase of surface toughness. As the <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>power</b> is 200 W, the carbon coating has the highest water-repellency and the excellent ability to sustain the low-temperature loading, so {{it is the best}} for production of the hermetic optical fiber coating.
