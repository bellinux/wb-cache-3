An extrinsic (or <b>relational)</b> <b>property</b> is a property {{that depends on}} a thing's relationship with other things.

In particular, if degeneracy is present in a pair of components then there will exist conditions where the pair will appear functionally redundant but other conditions where they will appear functionally distinct.|$|E

I argue that the best attempts to provide an account ofproperty efficacy fail to account for the efficacy of <b>relational</b> <b>properties,</b> and consider whether any of the strategies can be used to develop an account which can be satisfied by <b>relational</b> <b>properties.</b> I identify the use of supervenient causation as a prima Jacie promising strategy.

40|$|This article {{examines}} one argument {{in favour of}} {{the position that the}} <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> of mental states do not have causal powers over behaviour. This argument states that we establish that the <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> of mental states do not have causal powers by considering cases where intrinsic properties remain the same but <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> vary to see whether, under such circumstances, behaviour would ever vary. The individualist argues that behaviour will not vary with <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> alone, which means that they don’t have causal powers. Four replies are presented which all reject the premise that under such conditions behaviour can never be different, and each of these are refuted.

40|$|Symbolic {{execution}} is {{a classical}} program analysis technique, widely used for program testing and bug finding. In this work we generalize symbolic execution to support program analysis for <b>relational</b> <b>properties,</b> namely properties about two programs, or about two executions {{of a single}} program on different inputs. We design a relational symbolic execution engine, named RelSym, which supports testing and bug finding for <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> of imperative programs with for-loops and arrays. RelSym also combines relational symbolic execution with program logics. This combination is useful not only to test but also to prove <b>relational</b> <b>properties,</b> by exploiting the finite structure of arrays and for-loops. We demonstrate the flexibility of RelSym by testing and proving <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> for examples from different domains, such as information flow, program equivalence, sensitivity analysis, and relational cost analysis...|$|R

40|$|The most notable, or {{at least}} the most noted, form of {{property}} evolution has been the transfer of exclusive rights from collectives to individuals and vice versa, such as the farm collectivization in Soviet Union and the establishment of the People’s Communes in Mao’s China and their reversals. Such radical moments, however, constitute {{only a small part of}} history. For the most part, property rights evolve quietly and incrementally, which is hard to explain if we take exclusive rights as the core of property, or, to put it more generally, if we are focusing solely on the question of who owns the things. To describe the evolution of property rights in China, we employ the concept of <b>relational</b> <b>property.</b> It is a concept that is heavily influenced by Joseph William Singer’s “social relations model” and Ian Macneil’s “relational contract” and, in particular, their emphasis on the determinative role of social relations in the construction of property and contract rights. The bundle of sticks metaphor is at the heart of <b>relational</b> <b>property</b> because it recognizes that property rights can be, and often are, disaggregated as they adapt to changing social, economic, and technological demands. As we show in the context of the reform of Chinese rural land, the combination of the metaphor of separable interests — the sticks in the bundle — and the dependence of property interests on social relationships can explain the evolution of property rights more accurately than a perspective that stresses a single central meaning of property. postprin...|$|E

Third, we call for adopting a mediated action perspective on affordances as an alternative to Gibson’s ecological psychology. We outline a view of technology affordances as possibilities for human action mediated by cultural means conceived as a <b>relational</b> <b>property</b> of a three-way interaction between the person, mediational means, and environment.

Plausibly, things exemplify properties like being a sister or being a teacher in virtue of the relations they bear to other individuals.

Musical instrument constructions that are not bare are also interesting. The non-bare noun phrase can denote more than just the physical object: for example, it can also denote the music being made by an instrument. We have looked at referential and lexical properties of nouns in general, and showed how a referential and a lexical framework can account for the patterns of determination of musical instrument nouns. We propose a lexical structure modified from Pustejovsky (1995), where his qualia structure is replaced by <b>relational</b> <b>properties,</b> that are not tied to specific lexical items. These <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> involve the relation between the arguments of a lexical item. For musical instruments, the relation between the two arguments, physical object and the music is an agentive relation, since the physical object is needed to produce the music. Our structure can account for the patterning of musical instrument constructions in Dutch. Constructions that cannot be bare denote one of the arguments (i. e. the physical object or the music), constructions that are obligatorily bare denote the agentive reading of the <b>relational</b> <b>properties.</b> Finally, constructions that can both occur bare and non-bare refer to either the music or the agentive reading...|$|R

The latter claim is consistent with the present approach but the former is not. Rarity seems to be constitutive of a relation value specific to human beings (see below) but not, in itself, a value. Environmental ethics is supportable on the grounds that some, but not all, values are objective in the sense that no conscious evaluators are necessary for them to exist. Further, diversity (variety) as a value is ambiguous. “It” might take up a value and a disvalue aspect as well, depending on the context. A single rubin stone on a dress might be more refined and elegant than a variety of precious stones. Variety might be related to opulence, confusion, scare, even disgust. See O’Neill (1992).|$|E

The observation that only target-similar items can capture attention has usually been taken to show that the content of the attentional control settings consists of specific feature values. In contrast, the present study demonstrates that the top-down target template can include information about the relationship between the target and nontarget features (e. g., redder, darker, larger). Several spatial cuing experiments show that a singleton cue that is less similar to the target but that shares the same <b>relational</b> <b>property</b> that distinguishes targets from nontargets can capture attention to the same extent as cues that are similar to the target. Moreover, less similar cues can even capture attention more than cues that are identical to the target when they are relationally better than identical cues.

These findings generally replicate those previously obtained using a similar procedure with arithmetic problems (Sloutsky & Yarlas, 2000; Yarlas & Sloutsky, 2000), indicating that processing of elementary and <b>relational</b> <b>properties</b> might be based upon domain-general computation of these two types of properties.
