25|$|Secularization has had {{its impact}} in Germany as {{elsewhere}} in Europe; nevertheless, 28.9% {{of the total population}} is Catholic (23.761 million people as of December 2015), down 4% compared to the year 2000. Before the 1990 unification of the Federal Republic of Germany (or West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (or East Germany), Catholics were 42% of the population of West Germany. What makes it easier to know <b>religious</b> <b>statistics</b> in Germany is that Christian taxpayers must declare their religious affiliation as church tax is deducted by the state to be passed on to the relevant church in the state where the taxpayer lives.|$|E
25|$|As {{official}} <b>religious</b> <b>statistics</b> {{are forbidden}} in France, {{there are no}} official figures about religious practices in Brittany. However, successive polls show that the region {{tends to be more}} and more nonreligious. Catholic religion has started to decline after the Second World War, during the urbanisation of Brittany. A poll conducted in 2006 showed that Morbihan was the only département to have a strong Catholic population, around 70% of its inhabitants belonging to that religion. Loire-Atlantique and Côtes-d'Armor were among the least Catholic French départements, with only 50% of Catholics, while Ille-et-Vilaine and Finistère were at around 65%. Other religions are almost non-existent, apart from Islam which gathers between 1 and 3% of the inhabitants in Ille-et-Vilaine and Loire-Atlantique.|$|E

50|$|Before European {{colonisation}} {{the religion}} of the indigenous Māori population was animistic, but the subsequent efforts of missionaries such as Samuel Marsden resulted in most Māori converting to Christianity. The majority of 19th-century European migrants came from the British Isles, establishing the three dominant denominations in New Zealand - Anglicanism, Catholicism and Presbyterianism. The tendency for Scottish migrants to settle in Otago and Southland saw Presbyterianism predominate in these regions while Anglicanism predominated elsewhere; the effect of this is still seen in <b>religious</b> affiliation <b>statistics</b> today.

40|$|The recent housing bust has reignited {{interest}} in psychological theories of speculative excess (Shiller, 2007). I investigate this issue by identifying {{a segment of}} the U.

Evangelicals'' focus on Biblical prophecy could account for this difference, since it may enable them to interpret otherwise negative events as containing positive news, dampening the response of house prices to shocks. I provide evidence for this channel using a popular internet measure of "prophetic activity" and a 9 / 11 event study. I also analyze survey data covering religious beliefs and asset holding, and find that ''end times'' beliefs are associated with a one-third decline in net worth, consistent with these beliefs providing a form of psychic insurance (Scheve and Stasavage, 2006 a and 2006 b) that reduces asset demand.

Religion Statistics for National totals and by State and Territories from census 1996 were also included. It was sponsored by a collection of multicultural organizations from across Australia.
