The short length of wall on the right is the end wall of the wheelpit. The {{mechanism}} operating the flatrod system was on the north side, aligned with the short section of wall visible further away on the left: this probably formed part of the first support for the flatrods, which are believed to have travelled underground until they reached a V-shaped gulley, just visible towards the top of the photograph.|$|E

25|$|In {{this case}} {{there are two}} pure Nash equilibria: either both swerve to the left, or both swerve to the <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> example, it doesn't matter which side both players pick, {{as long as they}} both pick the same. Both {{solutions}} are Pareto efficient. This is not true for all coordination games, as the pure coordination game in Fig. 3 shows. Pure (or common interest) coordination is the game where the players both prefer the same Nash equilibrium outcome, here both players prefer partying over both staying at home to watch TV. The {Party, Party} outcome Pareto dominates the {Home, Home} outcome, just as both Pareto dominate the other two outcomes, {Party, Home} and {Home, Party}.|$|E
25|$|Ceballos {{then brought}} a section 1983 claim in the United States District Court for the Central District of California, asserting that his {{supervisors}} violated the First Amendment by retaliating against {{him for his}} memo. His supervisors claimed {{that there was no}} retaliation, that the changes in his job were instead dictated by legitimate staffing concerns, and that regardless, Ceballos’ memo was not constitutionally protected speech under the First Amendment. The District Court granted their motion for summary judgment, concluding that because Ceballos wrote his memo pursuant to the duties of his employment, he was not entitled to First Amendment protection for the memo’s contents. In the alternative, it ruled that even if he had a protected speech <b>right</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> context, the right was not clearly established and so qualified immunity applied to his supervisors' actions.|$|E
25|$|The text, in Book 7, {{describes}} {{the legend of}} a bhagavata (devotee) named Prahlada. He {{is described as a}} boy full of virtues, but who is born to a demon king who is persecuting people for their independent and different religious beliefs in favor of Vishnu. Prahlada disagrees with his father, resists him, and pursues what he feels is <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> legend, and many others, the text challenges presumption and stereotypes about a person based on birth and heredity, as well as encourages the readers through the character of Prahlada to resist threats, harassment and indoctrination from anyone. The Purana, state Gupta and Valpey, implies that virtues and vices are an individual's attribute and a person must be seen for who he is, rather than assumed to be following his parents because of hereditary circumstances.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the early}} 1960s, many local {{telephone}} companies, {{as well as}} the North American Numbering Plan of 1947, prescribed telephone number formats that included the name of the central office to which each telephone was connected. Traditionally, these names were often the names of towns, villages, other locally significant names, but larger communities that required more than one central office, may have used other names for each central office, such as Main, East, West, Central. Names were convenient to use and reduced errors when telephone numbers were exchanged verbally between subscribers and operators. When subscribers could dial themselves, the initial letters of the names were converted to digits as displayed on the rotary dial. Thus, telephone numbers contained one, two, or even three letters followed by up to five numerals. Such numbering plans are called 2L-4N, or simply 2-4, for example, as shown in the photo of a telephone dial of 1939 (<b>right).</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> example, LAkewood 2697, indicates that a subscriber dialed the letters L and A, then the digits 2, 6, 9, and 7 to reach this telephone in Lakewood, NJ (USA).|$|E

Following the French cavalry's battering of the British squares over the afternoon, Adam's brigade was brought up to reinforce the <b>right.</b> <b>In</b> <b>this</b> position the 52nd endured a heavy bombardment, of which Ensign Leeke of the 52nd reported afterwards [...] "the old officers, who had served during {{the whole of the}} Peninsular War, stated that they were never exposed to such a cannonade as the 52nd squares had to undergo on this occasion for 2½ hours from French artillery ½ mile to the front".

In order to bring Kaliokalani back to school, kahu John Papa ʻĪʻī openly confronted the high chiefess, stepped on her lap and seized the boy from her hands. ʻĪʻī told the chiefess: [...] "Not only is it asked of your moʻopuna [...] but of all the boys, of me, and of their teachers.
