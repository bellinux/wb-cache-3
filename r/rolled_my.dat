6000|$|I {{opened my}} eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and {{the man with the}} {{withered}} arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying to remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect. I <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> eyes into the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer abstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial into a glass. [...] "Where am I?" [...] I asked; [...] "I seem to remember you, and yet I cannot remember who you are." ...|$|E

60|$|Free!--and in {{the grasp}} of the Inquisition! I had {{scarcely}} stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when {{the motion of the}} hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!--I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With that thought I <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual--some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison {{at the base of the}} walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.|$|E

[...] "One is always afraid. One may talk, but [...] ." [...] He put down the glass awkwardly. [...] "The fear, the fear--look you--it is always there." [...] . He touched his breast near a brass button, on the very spot where Jim had given a thump to his own when protesting {{that there was nothing}} the matter with his heart. I suppose I made some sign of dissent, because he insisted, [...] "Yes! yes! One talks, one talks; this is all very fine; {{but at the end of}} the reckoning one is no cleverer than the next man--and no more brave. Brave! This is always to be seen. I have <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> hump (roule ma bosse)," [...] he said, using the slang expression with imperturbable seriousness, [...] "in all parts of the world; I have known brave men--famous ones! Allez!" [...] . He drank carelessly. [...] "Brave--you conceive--in the Service--one has got to be--the trade demands it (le metier veut ca). Is it not so?" [...] he appealed to me reasonably. [...] "Eh bien! Each of them--I say each of them, if he were an honest man--bien entendu--would confess that there is a point--there is a point--for the best of us--there is somewhere a point when you let go everything (vous lachez tout). And you have got to live with that truth--do you see? Given a certain combination of circumstances, fear is sure to come. Abominable funk (un trac epouvantable). And even for those who do not believe this truth there is fear all the same--the fear of themselves. Absolutely so. Trust me. Yes. Yes. [...] . At my age one knows what one is talking about--que diable!" [...] . He had delivered himself of all this as immovably as though he had been the mouthpiece of abstract wisdom, but at this point he heightened the effect of detachment by beginning to twirl his thumbs slowly. [...] "It's evident--parbleu!" [...] he continued; [...] "for, make up your mind as much as you like, even a simple headache or a fit of indigestion (un derangement d'estomac) is enough to [...] .

I was always matched tough, and it was always {{expected}} thing to get matched tough. I went to tournaments knowing I wasn’t going to get easy fights.

5000|$|... "Hot Dog" [...] was {{performed}} live at Led Zeppelin's performances at Knebworth in August 1979 {{and on their}} tour of Europe in 1980. During the two Knebworth concerts, Plant sang the last verse of the song with different lyrics than in the studio version. He ends with [...] "And I'll never go to Texas anymore" [...] instead of [...] "They just <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> doll right out the door." [...] It was {{made available to the}} record industry in America by Swan Song Records. However, the track was omitted from the Led Zeppelin DVD, which was released in 2003 and instead featured various other songs performed by the band at Knebworth.|$|E

5000|$|I Don't Want to Grow Up was {{recorded}} in April 1985 at Music Lab studios in Hollywood with producer and engineer David Tarling, {{who had worked with}} Stevenson on the recording and production of Black Flag's Loose Nut (1985), The Process of Weeding Out (1985), and In My Head (1985). [...] "He was really fond of those '80s production trappings, and the record is polluted and corrupted with them", Stevenson later reflected, complaining that [...] "It sounds like all weird, reverby, crazy '80s shit." [...] He also recalled that at one point Tarling passed out, leading Stevenson to take over the recording controls: [...] "He was having some kind of problems or something, and he was drinking a lot, and he got so drunk while we were recording that he passed out. So I basically kinda rolled his chair {{out of the way and}} <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> chair in place of it, and then lo and behold, Bill Stevenson is an engineer! And of course that record sounds terrible! I fucked it up good and well, but that's how I started learning. So it was basically a DIY kinda thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The White Queen {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} after airing on the Starz network on 10 August 2013. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post described the series as [...] "Sexy, empowering and violent". Linda Stasi of the New York Post {{agreed that the}} series is a hit, exclaiming [...] "The White Queen a royal winner". It was again unfavourably compared to HBO's high budget and fast-paced Game of Thrones. In comparison to Game of Thrones Neil Genzlinger speculates that [...] "even if dragons were allowed, they’d mostly be lounging around and, between bouts of relatively tame dragon sex, talking about eating people rather than actually eating them". The performances of Janet McTeer and James Frain were praised by several American reviewers. Amanda Hale, despite receiving praise for her performance by British reviewers, was unfavourably reviewed by U.S. critic Matthew Gilbert. He said [...] "There were moments when I <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> eyes—Amanda Hale, {{as the mother of}} young Henry Tudor, looks as if she is going to explode with ill intent. Really, her performance could be transposed into a Mel Brooks spoof". Louise Mellor of Den of Geek added [...] "Why does Lady Margaret Beaufort constantly look like she is sucking on a Murray Mint?" [...] TV Guide writer Matt Roush praised Hale's performance as [...] "intense", and favored the series, labeling it as [...] "fun", and on a one to ten scale, ranking it at seven.|$|E
