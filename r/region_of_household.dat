40|$|Among the 22 Arab countries, Egypt ranks {{amongst the}} worst for the {{treatment}} of women. Additionally, in the last 6 years, fertility surged to a 20 -year high of 3. 5 births per woman. Poorer women’s status and autonomy is often linked to high fertility; however, {{little is known about the}} factors that shape women’s autonomy and fertility in Egypt. This study evaluates determinants of women’s autonomy and the relationship between autonomy and fertility over time in a representative, longitudinal sample of women amidst a context of social transition: Arab Spring Egypt. Theory suggests that certain life course events, like educational achievement are important in shaping women’s status and autonomy. Household and community effects on women’s autonomy have yet to receive needed research attention. The research is guided by the theory of gender and power and the life course perspective focusing on important events that shape women’s autonomy at multiple levels over the life course. Furthermore, the relationship between women’s autonomy and subsequent fertility behaviors is often assumed, but rarely studied over time. In this study, I look at women’s autonomy and fertility over time in Egypt. Data come from the 2006 and 2012 Egyptian Labor Market Panel Survey (ELMPS), a nationally representative sample of households in Egypt and the 2008 Egyptian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). I use multilevel and standard OLS and Logistic regression models to show the relationship between individual, household, and community characteristics and measures of women’s autonomy and the relationship between women’s autonomy and fertility. Across all autonomy outcomes, <b>region</b> <b>of</b> <b>household</b> and household wealth are consistently associated with women’s autonomy. As expected, due to the greater social conservatism in Upper Egypt, the women in rural and urban Upper Egypt have less autonomy as compared to women in the Cairo region. The rural/urban differences in autonomy with women in rural areas being associated with less autonomy are also consistent with work that shows more patriarchal views in rural Egypt. Results show the importance of women’s social context in Egypt in her level of control and ability to exercise autonomy in the household and greater community. Results indicate that women’s autonomy was greater in 2012 as compared to 2006, and that after the initial uprisings, women reported more household autonomy. While improvements in autonomy in 2012 could be temporary and the data need to cover a longer period of time to capture social changes, this shows some change in women’s status and behavior in the midst of social and political change. Regional variation shows more autonomy in Cairo and less in Upper Egypt. While these improvements could be temporary and the data need to cover a longer period of time, this shows some change in women’s status in the midst of social and political change. Contrary to what was expected, more autonomous women have a higher number of births. It may be that more autonomous women fulfilled social expectations of high fertility, although they personally desired smaller families. This study makes significant contributions to the research on social and gender dynamics in modern Egypt. Additionally, this research uses a range of measures to operationalize autonomy, recognizing that each captures something different about a woman’s household experience. This study is one of the first to describe the household and social determinants of women’s autonomy and fertility in a transitional Egypt, specifically for a sample of women across the life course...|$|E

Households in rural areas have a higher demand for dietary diversity, relative to households in urban areas. This contradicts Thiele and Weiss’ (2003) argument that households in cities tend to have a higher demand for dietary diversity than people living in the rural environment, possibly because foods are less expensive in Nigerian rural areas relative to urban.

Existing literature primarily focuses on human-wildlife conflicts (i. e. crop raiding) and the potential for zoonotic disease spillover and emergence at the human-livestock-wildlife interface at PA boundaries. Understanding local perceptions of disease risk and vulnerability is essential for assessing human health relative to conservation areas. This understanding will promote better-informed consideration of human health impacts in decision making for conservation. Data from surveys taken at 301 households around Kibale National Park (KNP), an important conservation area, were used to identify risk perception and factors influencing perceived disease risk and vulnerability. Human sickness was the most frequently cited worry by respondents (88 %) and malaria was the most frequently cited illness (80. 1 %). Those living closer to PAs may be at greater risk for park-related harm and cited more frequent cases of malaria and non-malarial fever.

These three kinds of data and information were collected in our surveys of 19 villages from 2003 to 2005. // In this paper, household is by definition a residential unit where individuals share consumption. It is called "usra" in Arabic. On the other hand, family is a social unit based on household. In Egypt, family is generally called "‘āila" in Arabic. // We deal these two concepts <b>of</b> <b>household</b> and family, {{on the assumption that}} the basic unit of material life is household, and family is a unit in social life which goes beyond the material life. Since family is based on household, our study bases its analysis on household. // The paper consists of following six parts. // Introduction// 1. Data and methodology// 2. 19 villages in rural survey// 3. Demographic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>household</b> in 19 survey villages// 4. <b>Household</b> structure <b>of</b> 19 survey villages// 5. Family structure in 4 survey villages// 6. Historical change <b>of</b> <b>household</b> structure: a case study// Concluding remarks// The findings in the paper are summarized as follows. // According to the nation-wide surveys, there are regional differences between Lower and Upper Egypt in regard to household size, age structure, fertility and consanguinity. The survey in 19 villages shows the same regional variation in regard to demographic features. // As for the scale and structure <b>of</b> <b>household,</b> they are same regardless <b>of</b> <b>region.</b> Most <b>of</b> the <b>households</b> in rural Egypt now are nuclear household. On the contrary, the scale and structure of family differ by region. We conclude this regional difference as a cultural phenomenon that goes along with an arrangement of ouseholds within the village economy. // In comparison <b>of</b> <b>household</b> structure in 1861 and 2005 in Rashda village, the scale and composition <b>of</b> <b>household</b> differ largely.

40|$|Background: Adequate {{levels of}} {{physical}} activity {{are part of a}} healthy lifestyle and in this way linked to better health outcomes. For children and adolescents, the physical activity guideline recommends at least 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity every day. However, many adolescents are not physically active enough and they spend a lot of their time on sedentary activities (such as video games). A new generation of video games that require body movements to play them, so-called "active games", could serve to increase physical activity in adolescents. The activity level while playing these games is comparable to light-to-moderate intensity physical activity. The current study aims to increase our understanding of 1) the demographic characteristics of adolescents who play active games regularly (≥ 1 hour per week) and non-regularly (< 1 hour per week), 2) time spent on active games, 3) the contribution of active games to daily physical activity and 4) the type and amount of activities being replaced by active gaming. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a Dutch internet panel, questioning adolescents in conjunction with one of their parents. A random sample <b>of</b> 320 <b>households</b> (with stratification on gender of the parent and the adolescent, the age of the adolescent and the <b>region</b> <b>of</b> the <b>household)</b> was selected that owned a console or application for active video games and that had a child aged 12 through 16 years. 201 child–parent couples (63 % response) completed an internet survey with questions about demographics, physical activity an...|$|R
