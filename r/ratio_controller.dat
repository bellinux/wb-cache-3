The design of the static synchronous series source damping controllers is addressed using eigenvalue sensitivities. The eigenvalue sensitivity {{with respect to a}} parameter of a feedback controller estimates the eigenvalue shift when such parameter is changed. The controller design comprises two steps: the design of the phase compensation network and the calculation of the controller gain. A combined method is developed to take advantage of both ratio and phase modulating capabilities of static synchronous series sources. Once the phase controller has been designed and incorporated into the system model, the <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> has to be designed taking into account the effect of the phase controller due to the direct relationship between the input of the <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> and the phase itself.

This paper focuses {{on the development of}} a transmission <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> for a hydraulically actuated metal push-belt continuously variable transmission (CVT), using models for the mechanical and the hydraulic part of the CVT. The controller consists of an anti-windup PID feedback part with linearizing weighting and a setpoint feedforward. Physical constraints on the system, especially with respect to the hydraulic pressures, are accounted for using a feedforward part to eliminate their undesired effects on the ratio. The total <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> guarantees that one clamping pressure setpoint is minimal, avoiding belt slip, while the other is raised above the minimum level to enable shifting. This approach has potential for improving the efficiency of the CVT, compared to non-model based ratio controllers.

The largest deviations from the ratio setpoint are caused by actuator pressure saturation.

40|$|Flotation is an {{important}} and versatile mineral processing technique {{that is used to}} separate hydrophobic materials from hydrophilic. This technique makes it possible to mine complex ores that otherwise would have been regarded as uneconomic and non-beneficial. In this case flotation is used to separate copper from the unwanted gangue. The addition of lime is used to control the pH level in the flotation‚Äôs pulp, which governs the selectivity of the process, i. e. which minerals are recovered. Currently, fluctuating concentration grades of the produced metals have been observed in Boliden Aitik. Therefore, Boliden proposes a new control strategy which aims to maintain a constant ratio between the added lime and the incoming ore flow, {{but at the same time}} ensuring that the pH level is maintained within allowed limits. The aim of this thesis is to develop a model that captures the most essential dynamics of a process stage where lime is added, and then evaluate the suggested control strategy by studying suitable control structures. A linear model describing the system dynamics in a specific operating region is obtained by conducting step response experiments on the process. The model is then used to obtain a model describing the disturbances of the process, thereby yielding a complete model that describes the most important dynamics. The most promising control structure utilizes the concept of selective control, where a <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> is allowed to maintain a constant ratio as long as the pH level is within allowed boundaries. The pH level is maintained within the boundaries with upper and lower bound pH controllers that utilize the concept of an equivalent control objective (known as the strong acid equivalent) in order to achieve satisfying pH control. The results show that the control structure is able to maintain a constant ratio, and also ensure that the pH level is kept within the allowed limits. A cascade inspired pH <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> is also studied and evaluated. The results show that this pH <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> is only able to maintain a constant ratio as long as the incoming ore flow is constant. However, the outcomes also suggest that the concentration grades are either sensitive to variations in the ratio between added reagent and incoming ore flow, or that there is something else that causes them to vary...|$|E

Both valves have electro-hydraulic actuators which are operated via two hardware outputs to the two coils of the electro-hydraulic actuators. Undesirable compressor operation is prevented via the compressor pressure <b>ratio</b> limit <b>controller</b> (also known as œÄ controller). The function of the cool air limit controller is to rule out mode of operations, which leads to inadequate flow of cooling air to the turbine blades. The system exhausted temperature is being controlled by the IGVs by varying the air mass flow into the combustion chamber. Exhausted temperature is measured immediately downstream of the gas turbine via 24 triple-element thermocouples (MBA 26 CT 101 A/B/C to MBA 26 CT 124 A/B/C) placed around the surroundings of the exhaust diffuser. All B and C signals from the 24 triple-element thermocouples are {{used to calculate the}} mean turbine outlet temperature.

Objective: We compared the association between 2 asthma prescription measures (APMs) and subsequent risk of emergency department (ED) asthma visits. Design: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of automated pharmacy and healthcare utilization data from 3 large geographically diverse managed care organizations. Participants: We studied children, 3 to 15 years of age, with at least 1 encounter for asthma (hospitalization, ED, or ambulatory care), at least 1 dispensing of an asthma medication, and continuous enrollment between June 1996 and July 1997. Measures: Two performance measures were derived for patients with persistent asthma: 1) the proportion of individuals who have received controller therapy and 2) the <b>ratio</b> of dispensed <b>controller</b> to dispensed reliever medications. Children with persistent asthma were identified using the Health Employers Data Information System (HEDIS) criteria of the National Committee on Quality Assurance definition. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess independent effects in models for ED visits. Results: Among children with persistent asthma, the dispensing of a controller was associated with a significantly lower risk of an ED visit as compared with children not dispensed a <b>controller</b> (odds <b>ratio,</b> 0. 3; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 2 ‚Äì 0. 4). An association between the <b>ratio</b> of <b>controller</b> to reliever dispensing and the risk of subsequent ED visit was also observed, however, the underlying level of reliever dispensing modified the relationship. Among children with persistent asthma, the <b>ratio</b> of <b>controller</b> to reliever dispensing was inversely associated with risk of ED visit among children dispensed = 4 relievers/person-year.

A generalized state space model for a large gas turbine covering the whole steady operational range is designed according to subspace identification method with closed loop data as input to the identification algorithm. Then the model is used in developing a MPC and integrated into the plant existing control strategy. The strategy principle is based on feeding the reference signals of the pilot valve, natural gas valve, and the compressor pressure <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> with the optimized decisions given by the MPC instead of direct application of the control signals. If the set points for the compressor controller and turbine valves are sent in a timely manner, there will be more kinetic energy in the plant to release faster responses on the output and the overall system efficiency is improved. Simulation results have illustrated the feasibility of the proposed application that has achieved significant improvement in the frequency variations and load following capability which are also translated to be improvements in the overall combined cycle thermal efficiency of around 1.1 ¬†% compared to the existing one.|$|E

The traditional approach of using many single-input single output controllers has become more difficult to design, due to complex system interactions and constraints. Model predictive control offers an attractive solution to this problem because of its ability to handle multi-input multi-output systems with constraints on inputs and outputs. The application of model based predictive control to automotive engines is explored below and a multivariable engine torque and air-fuel <b>ratio</b> <b>controller</b> is described using a quasi-LPV model predictive control methodology.
