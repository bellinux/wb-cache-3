40|$|Abstract. Connecting rod fatigue in {{a certain}} type of diesel engine is {{analyzed}} by using finite element analysis method and the FEM software ANSYS. According the actual working conditions, the three-dimensional model with multi-body contact is established to simulate the contact between the connecting rod parts; By using APDL language programming, the work load on the connecting rod, calculated according all the link work loads, is applied to the connecting <b>rod</b> bearing <b>and</b> <b>bushing</b> through the oil film pressure distribution. By finite element method structural strength of the connecting rod was calculated, that can effectively guide the connecting rod design, which has been proved by practice...|$|R
60|$|Looking up, out of {{the heavy}} shadow that lay in the cleft, I could see, right in the sky, grey rocks shining transcendent in the pure empyrean. 'Are they so far up?' I thought. I did not dare to say, 'Am I so far down?' But I was uneasy. Nevertheless {{it was a lovely}} place, in the cold shadow, complete; when one forgot the shining rocks far above, it was a complete, shadowless world of shadow. Primroses were {{everywhere}} in nests of pale bloom upon the dark, steep face of the cleft, and tongues of fern hanging out, and here and there under the <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> twigs of <b>bushes</b> were tufts of wrecked Christmas roses, nearly over, but still, in the coldest corners, the lovely buds like handfuls of snow. There had been such crowded sumptuous tufts of Christmas roses everywhere in the stream-gullies, during the shadow of winter, that these few remaining flowers were hardly noticeable.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the effects of {{clearances}} in revolute joints. Experimental data is acquired from a testbed made of a four-bar mechanism of crank-rocker type, with motorized crank <b>and</b> clearance between <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> rocker. Since the revolute joint pairs can be changed, different values of clearance can be tested. Also the radius of the crank, the length of the truss and the angular speed of the crank can be changed, in order to investigate different settings. During test sessions, rocker <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> accelerations are acquired with accelerometers, and output graphs are compared to the numerical results coming from off-line multibody simulations. Surface wear on the axle <b>and</b> <b>bushing</b> of the revolute joint is measured either with a micrometer tool, either with a three-dimensional surface roughness tester. Wear does not affect the entire surface of the shaft, but mostly happens on specific spots, as predicted by our numerical model...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rods</b> <b>and</b> cones {{are both}} photoreceptors in the retina, {{but they are}} {{different}} in many aspects including the light response characteristics and, for example, cell morphology and metabolism. These differences would be caused by differences in proteins expressed in <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones. To understand the molecular bases of these differences between <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, {{one of the ways}} is to compare proteins expressed in <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, and to find those expressed specifically or dominantly. In the present study, we are interested in proteins in the outer segment (OS), the site responsible for generation of rod- or cone-characteristic light responses and also the site showing different morphology between <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones. For this, we established a method to purify the OS and the inner segment (IS) of <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> also of cones from purified carp <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, respectively, using sucrose density gradient. In particular, we were interested in proteins tightly bound to the membranes of cone OS. To identify these proteins, we analyzed proteins in some selected regions of an SDS-gel of washed membranes of the OS and the IS obtained from both <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, with Liquid Chromatography-tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using a protein database constructed from carp retina. By comparing the lists of the proteins found in the OS and the IS of both <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, we found some proteins present in cone OS membranes specifically or dominantly, in addition to the proteins already known to be present specifically in cone OS...|$|R

40|$|<b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> cone photoreceptors use {{similar but}} {{distinct}} sets of phototransduction proteins to achieve different functional properties, suitable for {{their role as}} dim and bright light receptors, respectively. For example, <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone visual pigments couple to distinct variants of the heterotrimeric G protein transducin. However, {{the role of the}} structural differences between <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone transducin α subunits (Tα) in determining the functional differences between <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones is unknown. To address this question, we studied the translocation and signaling properties of rod Tα expressed in cones and cone Tα expressed in rods in three mouse strains: rod Tα knockout, cone Tα GNAT 2 cpfl 3 mutant, <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone Tα double mutant rd 17 mouse. Surprisingly, although the rod/cone Tα are only 79 % identical, exogenously expressed rod or cone Tα localized and translocated identically to endogenous Tα in each photoreceptor type. Moreover, exogenously expressed rod or cone Tα rescued electroretinogram responses (ERGs) in mice lacking functional cone or rod Tα, respectively. Ex vivo transretinal ERG and single-cell recordings from rd 17 retinas treated with rod or cone Tα showed comparable <b>rod</b> sensitivity <b>and</b> response kinetics. These results demonstrate that cone Tα forms a functional heterotrimeric G protein complex in <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> that <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone Tα couple equally well to the rod phototransduction cascade. Thus, <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone transducin α-subunits are functionally interchangeable and their signaling properties do not contribute to the intrinsic light sensitivity differences between <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones. Additionally, the technology used here could be adapted for any such homologue swap desired...|$|R
50|$|He {{found that}} blind mice lacking classic outer-retinal photoreceptors (<b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones) still had eye-mediated {{responses}} to light. Mice with the melanopsin gene knocked out but with functional <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones were {{also able to}} entrain. However, when melanopsin was knocked out in blind mice without <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, they exhibited “complete loss of photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator, pupillary light responses, photic suppression of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase transcript, and acute suppression of locomotor activity by light.” Provencio concluded that either melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells or outer-retinal photoreceptors (<b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones) are sufficient to induce a response to light. However, {{in the absence of}} either <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones or melanopsin, melanopsin becomes necessary for photoentrainment of the circadian oscillator and for other photic responses.|$|R

40|$|Interactions between <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone {{signals in}} mudpuppy retinal neurones were {{investigated}} by intracellular recording. 2. The mudpuppy retina contains {{one kind of}} rod (lambda max = 525 nm) and one kind of cone (lambda max = 572 nm). The responses of receptors can be distinguished {{on the basis of}} their spectral sensitivities. 3. <b>Rod</b> <b>and</b> cone responses have different time courses of recovery and absolute sensitivities. Differences between receptor responses can be used to describe inputs to interneurones. 4. There are two spectral classes of horizontal cells: L-type and C-type. L-type cells are hyperpolarized by <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones in varying proportion, with some cells receiving little rod input. C-type cells are hyperpolarized by <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> depolarized by cones. 5. Bipolar cell receptive field centres receive input from cones or from <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones. There is no correlation between the spectral properties of centre responses and their polarity. 6. Antagonistic surrounds of bipolar cells show cone or <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone sensitivity. They are believed to be generated by the L-type horizontal cells. 7. Some bipolar cells exhibit chromatic interactions between cone signals in the centre <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> signals in the surround, which resemble those observed between the signals of different spectral classes of cones in species known to possess colour discrimination. 8. Amacrine and on-off ganglion cells have L-type responses showing both <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone sensitivity. 9. It is proposed that interactions between <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> cone signals observed in mudpuppy also exist in primate retina and are at least partially responsible for certain psychophysical observations of rod-cone interactions...|$|R

40|$|Two {{types of}} photoreceptors, <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cones, coexist in the {{vertebrate}} retina.

By deleting the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel CNG 3 we have generated a mouse lacking any cone-mediated photoresponse. In contrast, the rod pathway is completely intact in CNG 3 -deficient mice.

40|$|Previous {{assessment}} of verticality {{by means of}} <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame tests indicated that human subjects can be more (field dependent) or less (field independent) influenced by a frame placed around a tilted rod. In the present study we propose {{a new approach to}} these tests. The judgment of visual verticality (rod test) was evaluated in 50 young subjects (28 males, ranging in age from 20 to 27 years) by randomly projecting a luminous rod tilted between - 18 and + 18 ° (negative values indicating left tilts) onto a tangent screen. In the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test the rod was displayed within a luminous fixed frame tilted at + 18 or - 18 °. Subjects were instructed to verbally indicate the rod&# 8217;s inclination direction (forced choice). Visual dependency was estimated by means of a Visual Index calculated from <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test values. Based on this index, volunteers were classified as field dependent, intermediate and field independent. A fourth category was created within the field-independent subjects for whom the amount of correct guesses in the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test exceeded that of the rod test, thus indicating improved performance when a surrounding frame was present. In conclusion, the combined use of subjective visual vertical <b>and</b> the <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> frame test provides a specific and reliable form of evaluation of verticality in healthy subjects and might be of use to probe changes in brain function after central or peripheral lesions...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRods and cones contain {{closely related}} but {{distinct}} G protein-coupled receptors, opsins, which have diverged {{to meet the}} differing requirements of night and day vision. Here, we provide evidence for an exception to that rule. Results from immunohistochemistry, spectrophotometry, and single-cell RT-PCR demonstrate that, in the tiger salamander, the green <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> blue-sensitive cones contain the same opsin. In contrast, the two cells express distinct G protein transducin α subunits: rod α transducin in green <b>rods</b> <b>and</b> cone α transducin in blue-sensitive cones. The different transducins {{do not appear to}} markedly affect photon sensitivity or response kinetics in the green <b>rod</b> <b>and</b> blue-sensitive cone.
