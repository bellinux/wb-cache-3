5|$|The {{troops for}} the <b>Ranger</b> company {{were to be}} Airborne qualified, so the <b>Ranger</b> Training Center heavily {{recruited}} troops from the 82nd Airborne Division and 11th Airborne Division who had already completed United States Army Airborne School. In spite of this, only one <b>Ranger</b> operation in the conflict ever required an airborne landing. At the first Airborne <b>Ranger</b> graduation in November 1950, each <b>Ranger</b> was given a black and gold <b>Ranger</b> Tab as a shoulder sleeve insignia. A few days later, each <b>Ranger</b> was issued a blue and white tab and instructed to sew it above the <b>Ranger</b> Tab. The Airborne <b>Ranger</b> Companies then in Korea were deactivated on August 1, 1951. They were merged into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team {{to bring them back}} up to strength with airborne-qualified combat-experienced replacements. The 187th had been moved to Kyushu, Japanâ€™s southern island to take on a (then Top Secret) mission to save the UN negotiators at Kaesong, North Korea.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the <b>Ranger</b> units, the 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other <b>Ranger</b> units, most of the 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, it was believed that by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|In September 1950, on Collins' {{orders the}} <b>Ranger</b> Training Center {{was moved to}} Fort Benning, Georgia, and in October the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th <b>Ranger</b> Companies began training. The {{effective}} employment of the Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company had demonstrated {{the viability of the}} concept to Army planners, and the subsequent Chinese attacks in November reinforced the need for more such units. As a result, the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th <b>Ranger</b> Companies were ordered to form. Altogether, another fifteen <b>Ranger</b> companies would be formed in 1950 and 1951, and six of them would see combat in Korea.|$|E

5|$|Of {{a pool of}} 5,000 applicants, on 2 October the <b>Ranger</b> Training School {{selected}} 22 {{officers and}} 314 enlisted men {{for the first three}} <b>Ranger</b> companies, which were entirely white. A fourth, all African-American company was organized several days later. The 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Infantry Company (Airborne) was organized on 9 October 1950, assuming the lineage of A Company of the 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Battalion. It had an initial strength of 135 enlisted men and 5 officers under the command of First Lieutenant Warren E. Allen, company commander, and Second Lieutenant James C. Queen, executive officer. Originally it had been designated the 4th <b>Ranger</b> Infantry Company (Airborne), but the two companies switched designations, apparently to prevent accusations of racial discrimination. The unit was formally activated on 25 October 1950 at Fort Benning.|$|E
5|$|On 10 July, the U.S. Army {{ordered the}} {{deactivation}} {{of all of}} its <b>Ranger</b> companies. The Army noted that the <b>Ranger</b> companies were only an exercise directed by The Pentagon which was complete. The 3rd <b>Ranger</b> Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 in Korea. Like {{many of the other}} <b>Ranger</b> units, most of the <b>Ranger</b> veterans were folded into the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team, where their airborne skills could be used. Still, Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Infantry Company {{was awarded}} four {{campaign}} streamers for its {{service in the}} Korean War. In 1955, the unit was again designated A Company of the 2nd Battalion, 75th <b>Ranger</b> Regiment, and that unit carries on the 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Company's lineage.|$|E

In 1995, Pakistan <b>Rangers</b> was divided into the Pakistan <b>Rangers</b> (Punjab) and the Pakistan <b>Rangers</b> (Sindh) and the Mehran Force was then merged into Pakistan <b>Rangers</b> (Sindh).

5|$|The Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company was {{deactivated}} on 31 March 1951. Some of its {{equipment was}} subsequently consolidated with the 5th <b>Ranger</b> Infantry Company, which was newly arrived in Korea {{and had been}} assigned to the 25th Infantry Division. The men of the new <b>Ranger</b> company had formally attended <b>Ranger</b> School, though they were inexperienced and less effective in their initial actions with the division. In the meantime, most of the men of the former Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company were transferred to other units of the 25th Infantry Division, while those who were paratrooper qualified through the United States Army Airborne School were allowed to transfer to the 187th Regimental Combat Team or one of the other <b>Ranger</b> companies then beginning to arrive in Korea. During its brief existence, the Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company saw 164 days of combat and was awarded a Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.|$|E

5|$|With {{the defeat}} of the NK 766th Regiment at the Battle of P'ohang-dong, and the {{strength}} of U.S. infantry units in question, U.S. commanders felt recreating <b>Ranger</b> units was essential. In early August, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the Eighth United States Army, in command of all US forces in Korea, ordered Lieutenant Colonel John H. McGee, the head of its G-3 Operations miscellaneous division, to create a new experimental Army <b>Ranger</b> unit, the Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company. In the meantime, the <b>Ranger</b> Training Center was established at Fort Benning, Georgia.|$|E
5|$|With the {{successful}} {{development of the}} Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company, the establishment of additional <b>Ranger</b> companies was ordered. The composition of the new 2nd Army <b>Ranger</b> Infantry Company was formulated on the Table of Organization and Equipment documents of the World War II <b>Ranger</b> units. The 2nd <b>Ranger</b> Infantry Company was organized into three heavily armed platoons, which were overseen by a headquarters element of five men. Each platoon comprised 36 men in three squads: two assault squads and one heavy weapons squad. Each platoon was also furnished with 60mm M2 mortars, M20 Super Bazookas, and M1918 Browning Automatic Rifles. One sniper was designated for each platoon, with {{the remainder of the}} troops being equipped with M1 Garand and M2 Carbine rifles. They were authorized two vehicles: an M38 Jeep and an M35 2Â½ ton cargo truck. Overall, the company was far more heavily armed than both the Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company and standard infantry companies. Like the other numbered <b>Ranger</b> companies, its organization called for 5 officers and 107 enlisted men.|$|E

50|$|Subsequently, the Federal Government {{decided to}} {{substantially}} increase {{the strength of}} <b>Rangers</b> and the raising of separate Headquarters for Pakistan <b>Rangers</b> in Sindh.

5|$|As {{early as}} 18 February North Vietnamese forces had begun attacks by fire on bases <b>Ranger</b> North and South. On the {{following}} day the attacks commenced against <b>Ranger</b> North conducted by the 102nd PAVN Regiment of the 308th Division supported by Soviet-built PT-76 and T-54 tanks. The ARVN held on tenaciously throughout the night. President Thieu, oblivious to the previous nights attacks, and who was visiting I Corps headquarters at the time, advised General LÃ£m to postpone the advance on Tchepone and to shift {{the focus of the}} operation toward the southwest. By the afternoon of the 20th, the 39th ARVN <b>Ranger</b> Battalion had been reduced from 500 to 323 men and its commander ordered a retreat toward <b>Ranger</b> South, six kilometers away.

5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit.

This decision was unique to the Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of <b>Ranger</b> units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent <b>Ranger</b> companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army <b>Ranger</b> Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E
