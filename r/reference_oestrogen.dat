40|$|The {{present study}} {{assessed}} {{the sensitivity of}} immature hamster uterotrophic assay to <b>reference</b> <b>oestrogen</b> agonists/antagonists {{in order to develop}} a sensitive model for evaluation of endocrine-active compounds in diets. After performing a baseline for control animals, the sensitivity of immature females (postnatal day 18) to reference compounds was evaluated in a three-day uterotrophic assay. The absolute and adjusted dry uterine weights, fold induction over control for absolute wet uterine weight, and wet uterine weight/body weight ratio (%) were used as endpoints. The significantly active doses for reference oestrogens were as follows: 0. 6 μg/kg for 17 α-ethinyloestradiol (s. c.); 1 μg/kg/day (s. c.) and 40 μg/kg (p. o.) for diethylstilboestrol; 40 mg/kg (s. c.) and 160 mg/kg (p. o.) for bisphenol A. Co-treatment with tamoxifen at a dose of 1 mg/kg significantly antagonised the uterotrophic effect induced by 1 μg/kg 17 α-ethinyloestradiol, and showed the attenuated proliferative effect in histopathological examination. We found immature hamster uterotrophic assay as a sensitive model that could be a good alternative to the rat assay...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects on}} {{reproductive}} tract development in male rats, of neonatal exposure to potent (<b>reference)</b> <b>oestrogens,</b> diethylstilboestrol (DES) and ethinyl oestradiol (EE), {{with those of}} two environmental oestrogens, octylphenol and hisphenol A were systematically compared. Other treatments, such as administration of a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRHa) or the anti-oestrogen tamoxifen or the anti-androgen flutamide, were used to aid interpretation of the pathways involved. All treatments were administered in the neonatal period before onset of puberty. The cellular sites of expression of androgen receptors (AR) and of oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) and ERbeta were also established throughout development of the reproductive system. The main findings were as follows: (i) all cell types that express AR also express one or both ERs at all stages of development; (ii) Sertoli cell expression of ERbeta occurs considerably earlier in development than does expression of AR; (iii) most germ cells, including fetal gonocytes, express ERbeta but not AR; (iv) treatment with high, but not low, doses of potent oestrogens such as DES and EE, induces widespread structural and cellular abnormalities of the testis and reproductive tract before puberty; (v) the latter changes are associated with loss of immunoexpression of AR in all affected tissues {{and a reduction in}} Leydig cell volume per testis; (vi) none of the effects in (iv) and (v) can be duplicated by treating with high-dose octylphenol or bisphenol A; (vi) none of the reproductive tract changes in (iv) and (v) can be induced by simply suppressing androgen production (GnRHa treatment) or action (flutamide treatment); and (vii) the adverse changes induced by high-dose DES (iv and v) can be largely prevented by co-administration of testosterone. Thus, it is suggested that many of the adverse changes to the testis and reproductive tract induced by exposure to oestrogens result from a combination of high oestrogen and low androgen action. High oestrogen action or low androgen action on their own are unable to induce the same changes...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] The {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between oral contraceptives, non-contraceptive oestrogens, and the risk of gallstone disease requiring surgery. DESIGN [...] This was a hospital based case-control study carried out between 1987 and 1990. Main outcome measures were frequency of consumption of oral contraceptives and non-contraceptive oestrogens, and the corresponding multivariate relative risk estimates and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) in relation to various measures of use of the preparations. SETTING [...] A network including major teaching and general hospitals in the greater Milan area, northern Italy. SUBJECTS [...] Subjects were 235 women with gallstones requiring surgery and 538 controls admitted for acute diseases, other than digestive or hormonal diseases or those potentially influencing the use of female hormone preparations. MAIN RESULTS [...] For oral contraceptives, the relative risk for ever use was 0. 8 with 95 % CI 0. 4 to 1. 5. With reference to duration of use, the multivariate relative risk was 1. 0 for less than two and 0. 5 for two or more years of use. The relative risk was 1. 7 (95 % CI 0. 6 to 4. 7) in women who had last used the pill less than five years before diagnosis, but declined to 0. 4 (95 % CI 0. 2 to 1. 0) in those who had stopped more than five years before. With <b>reference</b> to <b>oestrogen</b> replacement treatment, the relative risk for ever use was 1. 9 (95 % CI 1. 0 to 3. 1). The relative risk, however, was not related to duration of use, since it was 1. 8 for less than two and 1. 5 for two or more years of use. Relative risk was higher for women who had last used non-contraceptive oestrogens 10 or more years before diagnosis (2. 4) than for shorter periods since last use (1. 3). CONCLUSIONS [...] On a clinical and public health scale, oral contraceptives and non-contraceptive oestrogens are unlikely to have an important influence in the aetiology of gallbladder disease...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gene {{signatures}} including OncotypeDX {{are under}} intense study for their prognostic value, {{but there is}} also interest in their predictive value for outcome on endocrine therapy and whether markers reflected by such signatures retain predictive value when measured immunohistochemically (IHC). OncotypeDX comprises 16 cancer (& 5 <b>reference)</b> genes, including <b>oestrogen</b> receptor (ER) -related genes, HER 2 pathway and proliferation/cell cycle-associated genes. A further gene in OncotypeDX, bcl- 2 -associated athanogene 1 (BAG- 1), is understudied in breast cancer but increased IHC for BAG- 1 has recently been related to improved tamoxifen outcome (Millar et al. Br J Cancer 100, 123 - 33, 2009). Here we examine if IHC for progesterone receptor (PR), HER 2 and the proliferation-associated protein Ki 67 can discriminate adjuvant tamoxifen outcome in an ER+ primary breast cancer series. We also evaluate BAG- 1 in this series, and in ER+ breast cancer cell lines during antihormone treatment and following acquisition of resistance, to further consolidate relation of BAG- 1 IHC to antihormone outcome. Material and Methods: IHC for PR, HER 2, Ki 67 (DAKO clone MIB 1) and BAG- 1 (Chemicon MAB 4611) was performed in FFPE tissue microarrays from tamoxifen-treated ER+ primary breast cancer patients with 10 year follow-up (n= 383). Clinicopathological data, including disease-free interval (DFI) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), were available for statistical analysis. BAG- 1 IHC was also performed on paraffin-embedded cell pellets prepared from ER+ breast cancer lines (MCF- 7, T 47 D) after 10 days culture with 10 - 7 M 4 OH-tamoxifen (4 OHT) and following acquisition of resistance. Results: Kaplan Meier analysis demonstrated that increased NPI, PR negativity, HER 2 overexpression and Ki 67 positivity (>= 10 %) could discriminate ER+ tamoxifen-treated patients with reduced DFI (P 70 %) had significantly poorer outcome (DFI & BCSS: P< 0. 001). Multivariate analysis confirmed these IHC markers were independent predictive factors for DFI and BCSS in this tamoxifen-treated series. Kaplan Meier analysis showed tamoxifen-treated patients with reduced/no nuclear BAG- 1 (< 30 % cut-off) had decreased DFI (p= 0. 046) and BCSS (p= 0. 018). Tumours with lower BAG- 1 also had reduced levels of ER (p= 0. 033), PR (P< 0. 001) and of luminal cytokeratins 7 / 8 (p= 0. 049) and 19 (p= 0. 022), with increased tumour grade (p= 0. 043). Patients whose tumours were Ki 67 positive with reduced/no BAG- 1 also had a poorer outcome than their BAG- 1 high counterparts (DFI p= 0. 073; BCSS p= 0. 034). In the ER+ models, BAG- 1 immunostaining was increased by initial 4 OHT treatment, but barely detectable in their acquired resistant sublines. Discussion: Along with PR and HER 2, IHC for Ki 67 and BAG- 1 may be useful in predicting outcome of adjuvant tamoxifen-treated patients and should be examined in future validation studies. BAG- 1 loss also hallmarks, and could contribute to mechanisms of, acquired tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer...|$|R
