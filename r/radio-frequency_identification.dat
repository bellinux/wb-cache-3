Our method is based on distributed self-gesture and artwork recognition, and does not need fixed cameras nor <b>radio-frequency</b> <b>identifications</b> sensors. We propose the use of dense trajectories sampled around the hand region to perform self-gesture recognition, understanding the way a user naturally interacts with an artwork, and demonstrate that our approach can benefit from distributed training. We test our algorithms on publicly available data sets and we extend our experiments to both virtual and real museum scenarios, where our method shows robustness when challenged with real-world data. Furthermore, we run an extensive performance analysis on our ARM-based wearable device.

40|$|Abstract—Omnipresence of <b>radio–frequency</b> <b>identifications</b> (RFIDs) {{and their}} use with {{existing}} and emerging new wireless technologies have paved way for a plethora of monitoring applications {{in the field of}} oil and gas. Degradation in liquefied petroleum/natural gas (LPG/LNG) quality and pipe infrastruc-ture can be a nuisance for the oil and gas industry, hence, we propose a human centric cyber–physical wireless monitoring system utilizing hybrid wireless technologies including RFIDs and other sensor motes to detect and prevent such hazards. The objective of this research is to allow maintainers and administrators to perceive and decide on top of the monitoring system to increase the performance and efficiency of the whole monitoring application.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an innovative method {{of the power}} analysis which presents the typical example of successful attacks against trusted cryptographic devices such as RFID (<b>Radio-Frequency</b> <b>IDentifications)</b> and contact smart cards.

This way of the power analysis is an entirely new approach and {{it is designed to}} combine the advantages of simple and differential power analysis. In the extreme case, this feature allows to determine the whole secret key of a cryptographic module only from one measured power trace. This attribute makes the proposed method very attractive for potential attackers. Besides theoretical design of the method, we also provide the first implementation results. We assume that the method will be certainly optimized to obtain more accurate classification results in the future...|$|R
40|$|Power {{analysis}} {{presents the}} typical example of successful attacks against trusted cryptographic {{devices such as}} RFID (<b>Radio-Frequency</b> <b>IDentifications)</b> and contact smart cards. In recent years, the cryptographic community has explored new approaches in power analysis based on machine learning models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), RF (Random Forest) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). In this paper, we made an extensive comparison of machine learning algorithms in the power analysis. For this purpose, we implemented a verification program that always chooses the optimal settings of individual machine learning models {{in order to obtain}} the best classification accuracy. In our research, we used three datasets, the first containing the power traces of an unprotected AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) implementation. The second and third datasets are created independently from public available power traces corresponding to a masked AES implementation (DPA Contest v 4). The obtained results revealed some interesting facts, namely, an elementary k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors) algorithm, which has not been commonly used in power analysis yet, shows great application potential in practice...|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of a novel receiver topology for ultralow-power applications, such as <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>identification</b> and wireless sensor networks, is presented in this brief. The receiver makes use of an injection-locked oscillator, which {{can also be used}} as an exact time reference. By applying phase steps to the injected RF signal, the injection-locked oscillator temporarily loses its lock condition. This can be detected by a simple digital phase detector. By modulating the time between these phase steps, a bit stream is encoded and the circuit is used as a low-data-rate receiver. Since the circuit overhead, as compared to the injection-locked time reference itself, only consists of a few digital gates, the architecture is suitable for use in ultralow-power applications. Starting from Adler's equation for injection-locked oscillators, the behavior of the receiver is theoretically explained and the maximum data bandwidth is determined. This is compared to simulation results and measured data of a 40 -nm CMOS implementation. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A {{system based}} on {{low-power}} radio transponders and associated analog and digital electronic circuitry has been developed for locating firefighters and other emergency workers deployed in a building or other structure. The system has obvious potential for saving lives and {{reducing the risk of}} injuries. The system includes (1) a central station equipped with a computer and a transceiver; (2) active <b>radio-frequency</b> (RF) <b>identification</b> tags, each placed in a different room or region of the structure; and (3) transponder units worn by the emergency workers. The RF identification tags can be installed in a new building as built-in components of standard fire-detection devices or ground-fault electrical outlets or can be attached to such devices in a previously constructed building, without need for rewiring the building. Each RF identification tag contains information that uniquely identifies it. When each tag is installed, information on its location and identity are reported to, and stored at, the central station. In an emergency, if a building has not been prewired with RF identification tags, leading emergency workers could drop sequentially numbered portable tags in the rooms of the building, reporting the tag numbers and locations by radio to the central station as they proceed...|$|R
40|$|Historically, {{the primary}} {{determinant}} {{for the state}} of parasitism has been the concentration of nematode eggs in the faeces (FEC). This descriptor has a number of limitations that have implications for the development of drug resistance and hamper the identification of resilient livestock. A major fallacy is that FEC can reliably assess the worm burden, the need for anthelmintic and the efficacy of that treatment. FEC is a ratio, eggs per gram of faeces, not a quantity. Not only is the denominator ignored but interpretation of the numerator requires knowledge of nematode species present and female fecundity which can be affected by infra-population dynamics. By definition, a parasite exists at the expense of its host. As such, the consistent ability of resilient animals to maintain performance, despite a high FEC, strongly suggests that FEC does not provide a reliable indicator of the cost of parasitism. This manuscript reviews the factors that affect FEC and argues for a step change in our approach to the control of nematode parasitism in pastoral systems to one focused on individual treatments based on animal performance utilising <b>radio-frequency</b> electronic <b>identification</b> and automated weighing and drafting systems...|$|R
