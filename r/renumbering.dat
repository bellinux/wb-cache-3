5|$|In the 1927 <b>renumbering</b> of {{highways}} in New Jersey, US130 {{was assigned}} {{as a part}} of New Jersey State Highway Route 25, which made up US1 and US9 as well. During that <b>renumbering</b> in 1927, Route 413 was originally New Jersey State Highway Route S-25, a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 25. The highway remained intact along its alignment in Keim Road to the BurlingtonBristol Bridge until January 1, 1953.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 <b>renumbering,</b> NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely {{by way of}} its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to follow its modern routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment. Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The small portion of NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the <b>renumbering</b> was incorporated into NY10.|$|E

In 1948 the 14 surviving engines passed to British Railways on nationalisation and were <b>renumbered</b> 58850-58863.|$|R
5|$|In 1911, the New York State Legislature created Route46, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Coopers Plains in Steuben County to Trumansburg in Tompkins County via Watkins Glen. East of Watkins Glen, Route46 proceeded generally northeastward through Burdett, Reynoldsville and Mecklenburg {{on its way}} to Trumansburg. On March1, 1921, the Route46 designation was reassigned to another highway in Allegany and Steuben counties as part of a partial <b>renumbering</b> of the legislative route system. The section of pre-1921 Route46 between Mecklenburg and Perry City went unnumbered until the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> of state highways in New York, when it became part of NY79.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, {{the state}} of Pennsylvania {{proposed}} <b>renumbering</b> I-80S to I-76 and I-280 to I-276 because the spurs of I-80S did not connect to I-80 in northern Pennsylvania. The <b>renumbering</b> {{was approved by the}} Federal Highway Administration on February 26, 1964. With this <b>renumbering,</b> the tollway would carry I-80S between the Ohio border and Pittsburgh, I-76 between Pittsburgh and King of Prussia, I-70 between New Stanton and Breezewood, and I-276 between King of Prussia and Bristol. In 1971, {{the state of}} Ohio wanted to eliminate I-80S, replacing it with a realigned I-76. The state of Pennsylvania disagreed with the change and recommended that I-80S become I-376 instead. The Pennsylvania government later changed its mind and supported Ohio's plan to renumber I-80S as I-76. In December of that year, the change was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials. As a result, I-76 would follow the highway between the Ohio border and King of Prussia.|$|E
5|$|NY45 was {{originally}} designated as New York State Route305 {{as part of}} the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> of state highways in New York. It was renumbered to New York State Route94 in the early 1940s before becoming NY45 on January 1, 1949.|$|E

25|$|To {{solve this}} issue, the AA Highway was <b>renumbered</b> in late 1995. The AA Highway {{including}} the Grayson spur was <b>renumbered</b> KY 9, and the Greenup spur was <b>renumbered</b> as KY 10. KY 10 also overlaps {{portions of the}} AA Highway throughout the entire highway's existence. Old KY 9 in Campbell county was <b>renumbered</b> as KY 915, and old KY 10 between Vanceburg and South Portsmouth was redesignated as KY 8.|$|R
50|$|In 1923 the EE {{class was}} <b>renumbered</b> 350 to 379, the E class were <b>renumbered</b> 236 to 245, but all were taken off {{register}} except for 506, which became unclassed shunter 236. In 1929 the EE class were <b>renumbered</b> 350 to 390 and re-classed E.|$|R
5|$|NY63A was an {{alternate}} route of NY63 between Angelica, Allegany County, and Nunda, Livingston County. The route was assigned {{as part of}} the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> and redesignated as NY408A in the early 1940s.|$|E
5|$|NY83 {{initially}} extended {{south to}} Frewsburg {{when it was}} assigned {{as part of the}} 1930 <b>renumbering.</b> The portion of the route between Frewsburg and Conewango Valley became part of US62 , resulting in the truncation of NY83 to its current southern terminus in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|NY86 was {{established}} in the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> of state highways in New York, largely replacing a realigned NY3. North of Saranac Lake, NY86 initially followed modern NY186 before being rerouted onto its modern alignment. The portion of NY86 north of Harrietstown was once NY192.|$|E

50|$|In some later knot tables, {{the knots}} have been <b>renumbered</b> {{slightly}} (knots 10163 to 10166 are <b>renumbered</b> as 10162 to 10165) so that knots 10161 and 10162 are different.

5|$|NY86A was a spur route {{connecting}} NY86 in Lake Placid to NY9N in Keene. It {{was assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> of state highways in New York and replaced by an extended NY73 in the mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|NY93 was {{established}} {{as part of}} the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> of state highways in New York, connecting the cities and villages of Youngstown, Lockport, and Akron. Several portions of the route have been realigned since NY93 was truncated from NY33 in Peters Corners in 1935.|$|E
5|$|New Jersey Route 163 {{originated}} as an {{alignment of}} U.S. Route 46 (co-signed with New Jersey State Highway Route 6). The alignment of 6 and 46 went along the {{alignment of the}} original State Highway Route 5 from the early 1920s, stretching from Newark to the bridge over the Delaware River at Delaware. The route was decommissioned when the 1927 <b>renumbering</b> occurred. After that <b>renumbering,</b> the route became State Highway Route 6, a co-designation to U.S. Route 46, which had been assigned the prior year. The two highway designations remained intact until the 1953 <b>renumbering,</b> when Route 6 was decommissioned in favor of using the U.S. 46 designation. U.S. Route 46 was realigned once again when the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge opened in 1953, when the alignment of the highway was changed to head along former State Highway Route 8 (mostly New Jersey Route 94), where it ended at U.S. Route 611 and NJ 94, where its current terminus is located. After the realigning of the Delaware Bridge alignment, the route was renumbered to New Jersey Route 163. Two years later, the Delaware Bridge was swept away in floods caused by Hurricane Connie and Diane in 1955, which took out several other bridges over the Delaware.|$|E

5|$|Prior to 1927, {{the route}} was {{a branch of}} pre-1927 Route 6, which had run south from Camden and split into two {{branches}} in Mullica Hill that ran to Salem and Bridgeton. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway <b>renumbering,</b> Route 46 was designated along the former branch of pre-1927 Route 6 that ran from Bridgeton to Mullica Hill. In the 1953 New Jersey state highway <b>renumbering,</b> which stated that no state route and U.S. route could share the same number, Route 46 was changed to Route 77 to avoid a conflict with US 46 in North Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Route172 {{originated}} as {{alignment of}} State Highway Route S-28, which was assigned in the 1927 state highway <b>renumbering.</b> In the 1953 <b>renumbering,</b> State Highway Route S-28 was reassigned as Route18. However, {{just a few}} years after the designation of NJ 18 in New Brunswick along George Street, construction of a bypass around New Brunswick began. The highway was constructed along Burnet Street, which became state-maintained by the State Highway Department. The route was completed to Route27, and Route18 was moved onto that alignment. The former alignment of Route18 remained state-maintained up to the intersection with Commercial Avenue, which was eventually re-designated as Route172.|$|E
5|$|The Caton–Corning {{segment of}} the route was {{acquired}} {{by the state of}} New York in 1911 and designated as part of NY44 (now NY414) as part of the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> of state highways in New York. It received its current designation in 1949 when NY414 was truncated to begin in Corning. The highway leading east from Caton to Big Flats was county-maintained from the 1930s through the 1970s, even though it had been part of NY13 from the 1930 <b>renumbering</b> to the 1940s. The state of New York assumed maintenance of the highway by 1986, and the new state highway became an extension of NY225.|$|E
