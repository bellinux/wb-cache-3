50|$|A <b>rough</b> <b>conversion</b> between Brix, degrees Plato or degrees Balling and {{specific}} gravity {{can be made}} by dividing the number behind the decimal point in the SG (which {{is often referred to as}} gravity points) by 4. So a specific gravity of 1.048 has 48 gravity points. 48 divided by 4 is 12 degrees Plato, Balling or Brix. This conversion method is pretty accurate up to a specific gravity of 1.070 at which point the approximation begins to deviate from the actual conversion.|$|E

40|$|The Ce-V {{conversion}} coating on magnesium alloy was modified by stearic acid (SA). Scanning electronic microscope (SEM), contact angle measurement, energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) were adopted {{to study the}} microstructure, surface wettability, and chemical composition of the modified coating. Self-cleaning behavior and corrosion resistance of the coating were investigated by anti-adhesion and electrochemical experiments, respectively. The {{results show that the}} SA modification treatment not only repairs the cracks of the {{conversion coating}}, but also renders a superhydrophobic surface by grafting the long alkyl chains onto the <b>rough</b> Ce-V <b>conversion</b> coating. After 8 h of treatment at room temperature, the modified coating surface with a contact angle of 154. 6 &# 176; exhibits good self-cleaning property. The modified coating increases the corrosion resistance (R coat) by 25 times and decreases the corrosion current density (i corr) by 2 orders of magnitude compared to the Ce-V conversion coating. The modified coating significantly improves corrosion resistance...|$|R

International audienceClosed-cell metallic foams {{are known for their}} rigidity, lightness, thermal conductivity as well as their low production cost compared to open-cell metallic foams. However, they are also poor sound absorbers. Similarly to a rigid solid, a method to enhance their sound absorption is to perforate them. This method has shown good preliminary results but has not yet been analyzed from a microstructure point of view. The objective of this work is to better understand how perforations interact with closed-cell foam microstructure and how it modifies the sound absorption of the foam. A simple two-dimensional microstructural model of the perforated closed-cell metallic foam is presented and numerically solved. A <b>rough</b> three-dimensional <b>conversion</b> of the two-dimensional results is proposed. The results obtained with the calculation method show that the perforated closed-cell foam behaves similarly to a perforated solid; however, its sound absorption is modulated by the foam microstructure, and most particularly by the diameters of both perforation and pore. A comparison with measurements demonstrates that the proposed calculation method yields realistic trends. Some design guides are also proposed. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{introduces}} a rough set technique for {{solving the problem}} of mining Pinyin-to-character (PTC) con-version rules. It first presents a text-structuring method by constructing a language information table from a corpus for each pinyin, which it will then apply to a free-form textual corpus. Data generalization and rule extraction algorithms can then be used to eliminate redundant information and extract consistent PTC conversion rules. The design of our model also addresses {{a number of important}} issues such as the long-distance dependency problem, the storage requirements of the rule base, and the consistency of the extracted rules, while the performance of the extracted rules as well as the effects of different model parameters are evaluated experimentally. These results show that by the smoothing method, high precision conversion (0. 947) and recall rates (0. 84) can be achieved even for rules represented directly by pinyin rather than words. A comparison with the baseline tri-gram model also shows good complement between our method and the tri-gram language model.

40|$|Global {{sustainable}} development {{is based on}} an equally formation of requirements to environmental, economical and socio-cultural pillars. Technology as a neutral tool can help to fix the balance necessary to the interests of our without compromising those of later generations. Lead-free technologies are of such a dimension and today enough time passed by to risk a first approximation to comprehensive evaluation. Starting as an environmental topic since 15 years there are intensifying activities in the transition from the well known Tin/Lead to various alternate lead-free interconnection systems. Many projects were done to find best solutions. Tin/Silver/Copper will be the most favorite future alternative. The environmental aspects as toxicity, energy use, behavior in recycling and landfill of soldered PCB´s but also the economical impacts i. e. availability of <b>rough</b> materials and <b>conversion</b> costs will be discussed. Socio-cultural impacts like regional different behavior of companies and consumers are discussed before background of lead-free electronics becoming reality in Europe next year. From a technological standpoint the open questions and their possible solutions like i. e. exceptions, test methods for wiskers and threshold of lead in a homogeneous material. Closing some consequences of the latest development will be pointed out...|$|R
6000|$|In {{about two}} years Norway was all gone over with a <b>rough</b> harrow of <b>conversion.</b> Heathenism at least {{constrained}} to be silent and outwardly conformable. Tryggveson, next {{turned his attention to}} Iceland, sent one Thangbrand, priest from Saxony, of wonderful qualities, military as well as theological, to try and convert Iceland. Thangbrand made a few converts; for Olaf had already many estimable Iceland friends, whom he liked much, and was much liked by; and conversion was the ready road to his favor. Thangbrand, I find, lodged with Hall of Sida (familiar acquaintance of [...] "Burnt Njal," [...] whose Saga has its admirers among us even now). Thangbrand converted Hall and one or two other leading men; but in general he was reckoned quarrelsome and blusterous rather than eloquent and piously convincing. Two skalds of repute made biting lampoons upon Thangbrand, whom Thangbrand, by two opportunities that offered, cut down and did to death because of their skaldic quality. Another he killed with his own hand, I know not for what reason. In brief, after about a year, Thangbrand returned to Norway and king Olaf; declaring the Icelanders to be a perverse, satirical, and inconvertible people, having himself, the record says, [...] "been the death of three men there." [...] King Olaf was in high rage at this result; but was persuaded by the Icelanders about him to try farther, and by a wilder instrument. He accordingly chose one Thormod, a pious, patient, and kindly man, who, within the next year or so, did actually accomplish the matter; namely, get Christianity, by open vote, declared at Thingvalla by the general Thing of Iceland there; the roar of a big thunder-clap at the right moment rather helping the conclusion, if I recollect. Whereupon Olaf's joy was no doubt great.|$|R
