5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} has <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase in the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which has <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase in hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|Samarium {{is one of}} the few {{lanthanides}} {{that form}} a monoxide, SmO. This lustrous golden-yellow compound was obtained by reducing Sm2O3 with samarium metal at elevated temperature (1000°C) and pressure above 50kbar; lowering the pressure <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> incomplete reaction.

25|$|This <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> loss of {{function}} of the cycle, and <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> accumulation of glutamate. This glutamate further stimulates the NMDA receptors, thus acting synergistically with quinolinic acid to increase its neurotoxic effect by increasing the levels of glutamate, as well as inhibiting its uptake. In this way, quinolinic acid self-potentiates its own toxicity. Furthermore, quinolinic acid <b>results</b> <b>in</b> changes of the biochemistry {{and structure of the}} astrocytes themselves, <b>resulting</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apoptotic response. A loss of astrocytes <b>results</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> pro-inflammatory effect, further increasing the initial inflammatory response which initiates quinolinic acid production.|$|R
