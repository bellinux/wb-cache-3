5|$|Metroid Prime was a {{collaboration}} between <b>Retro</b> Studios and Nintendo EAD and R. The overall design was a collaborative effort, while the art and engineering was done entirely at <b>Retro,</b> and the music was handled in Japan. <b>Retro</b> Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, <b>Retro</b> worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited <b>Retro</b> in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing the prototype of a first-person shooter engine they had created. In 2000 and early 2001, three games in development at <b>Retro</b> were canceled, and in July 2001, an RPG, Raven Blade, was terminated, leaving Prime {{the only game in}} development. During the last nine months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|During the 68 {{nomination}} years, 144 {{authors have}} had works nominated; 48 {{of these have}} won, including co-authors, ties, and <b>Retro</b> Hugos. Robert A. Heinlein has received the most Hugos for Best Novel {{as well as the}} most nominations, with five wins (including one <b>Retro</b> Hugo) and eleven nominations. Lois McMaster Bujold has received four Hugos on ten nominations; the only other authors to win more than twice are Isaac Asimov (including one <b>Retro</b> Hugo), Connie Willis, and Vernor Vinge, who have each won three times. Ten other authors have won the award twice. The next-most nominations by a winning author are held by Robert J. Sawyer and Larry Niven, who have been nominated nine and eight times, respectively, and each have only won once, while Robert Silverberg has the greatest number of nominations without winning at nine. Three authors have won the award in consecutive years: Orson Scott Card (1986, 1987), Lois McMaster Bujold (in 1991, 1992), and N. K. Jemisin (in 2016, 2017).|$|E
5|$|Retrospective Hugo Awards, or <b>Retro</b> Hugos, {{were added}} in the mid-1990s. These awards are given by Worldcons held 50, 75, or 100 years after a Worldcon where no Hugos had been awarded, which were the {{conventions}} in 1939–41, 1946–52, and 1954, and are given for works {{that would have been}} eligible in that year, by the same process as the regular Hugos. <b>Retro</b> Hugos have only been given five times: in 1996, 2001, and 2004 for 50 years prior, and 2014 and 2016 for 75 years prior. The six Worldcons eligible in 1997–2000, 2002, and 2015 chose not to award them. The next opportunity will be in 2022 for 1947.|$|E
5|$|The song {{reveals a}} {{complete}} departure from Ciara's previous style, neither a sensual ballad nor incorporating Crunk influences. It embraces a dance-pop sound, while including R and funk via a <b>retro</b> 1970s-style guitar {{present in the}} piece. Many critics noted {{the similarities between the}} song and music on Timberlake's album FutureSex/LoveSounds (2006). Critics gave the song mixed reviews, complimenting the song's funk and <b>retro</b> feel and the chemistry present between Ciara and Timberlake. The song would later go on to be nominated for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals at the 52nd Grammy Awards.|$|E
5|$|A fourth {{game in the}} series, Metroid Prime 4, was {{announced}} at Nintendo's E3 2017 Spotlight livestream, and is currently under development for the Nintendo Switch. However, the game will be handled by an entirely new development team overseen by series producer Kensuke Tanabe, instead of <b>Retro</b> Studios. The fourth installment is scheduled for release sometime in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Built between 1088 and {{the early}} 15th century, the unusual {{features}} of Chichester Cathedral are a Transitional <b>retro</b> choir, a pair of early Norman relief carvings and its freestanding belfry of the 15th century. The spire, rebuilt after its collapse in 1860, {{can be seen from}} the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|During the 50 {{nomination}} years, 60 editors {{have been}} nominated for the original Best Professional Editor, the Short Form, or the Long Form award, including <b>Retro</b> Hugos. Of these, Gardner Dozois has received the most awards, with 15 original awards out of 19 nominations for the original category {{and one for the}} Short Form. The only other editors to win more than three awards are Ben Bova, who won 6 of 8 nominations for the original award, Ellen Datlow, who won 7 of 17 nominations, split between the original and short form awards, and John W. Campbell, Jr. with 5 out of 5 nominations for the <b>Retro</b> Hugo awards. The two editors who have won three times are Edward L. Ferman with 3 out of 20 original nominations and Patrick Nielsen Hayden with 3 out of 3 Long Form nominations. Stanley Schmidt has received the most nominations, at 27 original and 7 Short Form, winning one Short Form.|$|E
5|$|During the 56 {{regular and}} <b>retro</b> {{nomination}} years, 93 writers have been nominated; 20 {{of these have}} won, including ties. David Langford has received {{the largest number of}} awards, with 21 wins out of 31 nominations. He was nominated every year from 1979 through 2009, and won 19 times in a row from 1989 through 2007. The other writers to win more than once are Richard E. Geis, with seven wins out of sixteen nominations; Mike Glyer, with four wins out of twenty-four nominations; Susan Wood Glicksohn, with three of eight; Harry Warner, Jr., with two out of seven; Wilson Tucker, with two out of six; Bob Shaw, who won both times he was nominated; and Ray Bradbury, who won both <b>Retro</b> Hugos he was nominated for.

Leeper, who was nominated twelve times in a row from 1990 through 2001, and Steven H Silver, whose twelve nominations span 2000-2013.|$|E
5|$|In 1990 the Best Original Art Work {{award was}} given {{as an extra}} Hugo Award, and was listed again in 1991, though not {{actually}} awarded, and established afterward as an official Hugo Award. It was then removed from this status in 1996, {{and has not been}} awarded since. The <b>Retro</b> Hugos were created in the mid-1990s, and were first awarded in 1996.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Radica {{created a}} Menacer-based direct-to-TV {{dedicated}} console {{with the original}} six-game cartridge built into a light gun controller {{as part of their}} Play TV Legends line of Sega Genesis dedicated consoles. <b>Retro</b> Gamer wrote that Radica's gun is based on the Sega Saturn light gun's design and not the Menacer's.|$|E
5|$|In January 2014, Elite Systems, who {{produced}} a successful range of {{software for the}} original ZX Spectrum in the 1980s, announced plans for a Spectrum-themed bluetooth keyboard that would attach to mobile devices such as the iPad. The company provided a crowdfunding campaign in order to fund the project, which would be compatible with games already released on iTunes and Google Play. Elite Systems took down its Spectrum Collection application the following month, due to complaints from authors of the original 1980s game software {{that they had not}} been paid for the content. Later that year, a £100 Sinclair ZX Spectrum Vega <b>retro</b> video game console was announced by <b>Retro</b> Computers and crowdfunded on IndieGogo, with the apparent backing of Clive Sinclair as an investor, but without a full keyboard and manufactured in a limited capacity.|$|E
5|$|Metroid is {{a science}} fiction action-adventure video game series created by Nintendo. The series is {{primarily}} produced by the company's first-party developers Nintendo R and <b>Retro</b> Studios, although some installments were handled by other developers, including Fuse Games, Team Ninja, Next Level Games, and MercurySteam.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2017, Nintendo {{announced}} {{during their}} Nintendo Spotlight presentation at E3 2017 that Metroid Prime 4 {{is currently in}} development for the Nintendo Switch. However, the game will be handled by a new development team instead of <b>Retro</b> Studios, and is scheduled for release sometime in 2018.|$|E
5|$|On November 5, 2016, at the 20th Anniversary Fan Festa {{event in}} Ichikawa, Japan, Inti Creates {{announced}} that they acquired the license of the original Blaster Master game from Sunsoft, and on March 9, 2017, Blaster Master Zero, a <b>retro</b> 8-bit style remake of the original NES game, was released for the Nintendo 3DS eShop and Nintendo Switch.|$|E
5|$|Players {{and game}} journalists {{consider}} the game among the Spectrum's best. Sabre Wulf {{was the first}} of four titles in the Sabreman series for the ZX Spectrum. <b>Retro</b> Gamer credited the character's name and character traits for its lasting memorability. As an ordinary human with a hat and exaggerated nose, Sabreman fit the video game 8-bit era's character archetype. The last, unreleased game in the Spectrum Sabreman series, Mire Mare, was planned to have been similar to Sabre Wulf in gameplay. Rare, the successor to Ultimate, later released a side-scrolling platformer in 2004 for the Game Boy Advance handheld console—also titled Sabre Wulf—in which Sabreman enlists jungle animals to solve the Sabre Wulf's puzzles. It was not received well by fans. Elements from the original Sabre Wulf appear in other games, including Rare's Jet Force Gemini. <b>Retro</b> Gamer considered Sabreman's recurring appearance to be proof of Rare's interest in the character and series.|$|E
5|$|The club's home strip {{remained}} unchanged {{from the previous}} season; a red jersey with white sleeves, shorts and socks. The new away kit, a <b>retro</b> yellow jersey with a blue collar trim and shorts, {{was based on the}} Arsenal strip worn in the 1979 FA Cup Final.|$|E
5|$|ABA Games is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic {{games in the}} genre. Its games feature stylised <b>retro</b> graphics, innovative gameplay features and modes and are set in random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.|$|E
5|$|Black Cherry is {{the second}} studio album by English {{electronic}} music duo Goldfrapp, released on 23 April 2003 by Mute Records. It marked {{a departure from the}} ambient sound of their debut album, Felt Mountain (2000), incorporating glam rock and synthpop music; inspirations were Spanish disco group Baccara and Swedish techno artist Håkan Lidbo. The album was met with positive reviews, with many critics complimenting its blend of <b>retro</b> and modern electropop music.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong Country Returns is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{video game}} developed by <b>Retro</b> Studios {{and published by}} Nintendo for the Wii console. The game was released first in North America in November 2010, and in PAL regions and Japan the following month. A stereoscopic port of the game, titled Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D, was released for the Nintendo 3DS in May 2013, and in Japan the following month.|$|E
5|$|During the 53 {{nomination}} years, 67 {{artists have}} been nominated; 27 {{of these have}} won, including co-winners and <b>Retro</b> Hugos. Brad W. Foster has received {{the largest number of}} awards, with 8 wins out of 27 nominations. William Rotsler and Tim Kirk have won five awards, from twenty-three and eight nominations respectively.

Mike Resnick has had the most nominations at eight, and Ursula K. Le Guin and Greg Egan have been nominated seven times each. Fourteen other authors have been nominated at least four times, while Egan has the most number of nominations without winning.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Cinema <b>Retro</b> {{magazine}} {{hosted a}} screening of the film at Ettington Park. Richard Johnson was a special guest at the event and participated in a Q prior to the screening. Johnson {{said that he had}} never actually stepped foot in the hall during filming, and that this was the first occasion he had actually been inside the premises. The movie was mentioned in Dan Simmons' 2002 novel A Winter Haunting.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Amazon.com {{and video}} game {{retailer}} GameStop offered preorder codes for downloadable content. GameStop offered a G1 <b>Retro</b> Pack that unlocks a The Transformers Generation 1 themed Optimus Prime skin, a Generation 1 inspired Megatron rifle based the character's alternate mode, and a Shockwave Blast Cannon. Amazon offered a Generation 2 Bruticus skin. In the United Kingdom, Play.com also offered preorder codes. The codes unlocked the Dinobot Swoop {{for use in}} the competitive multiplayer.|$|E
5|$|In a {{retrospective}} review, the J-Man of Just Games <b>Retro</b> said {{the game is}} overly slow, as the player must produce a few basic buildings and peasants in order to gather resources, and then start building combat units, while the enemy starts with more buildings {{and the ability to}} immediately send out offensive units to undo the player's efforts. He also criticized that the basic units of the two sides are essentially identical and that the interface is clunky, but praised the resource system and effective enemy AI.|$|E
5|$|Joint launch {{customer}} British Airways {{operated the}} 757-200 for 27 years before retiring the type in November 2010. To celebrate the fleet's retirement, the airline unveiled {{one of its}} last three 757-200s in a <b>retro</b> style livery on October 4, 2010, matching the color scheme that it introduced the aircraft into service with in 1983. Subsequently, the type remained in operation with the company's subsidiary, OpenSkies.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Prime 2: Echoes is a {{first person}} action-adventure video game {{developed}} by <b>Retro</b> Studios and published by Nintendo for the GameCube video game console. It is the seventh published game in the Metroid series, a sequel to Metroid Prime, and the first game in the series with a multiplayer feature. Echoes was released in North America, Europe, and Australia in 2004; and in Japan under the name Metroid Prime 2: Dark Echoes in May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{asserted}} that the film's music mainly lifted {{to the success of}} Bandslam from reviews, especially the ska version of Everything I Own, that the film is full of unexpected pleasures set to a surprisingly <b>retro</b> soundtrack. Similarly, Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter emphasized the effect of the film's music-driven comedy set against the backdrop of a high school battle of the bands competition which manages {{to come up with a}} fresh backbeat for the familiar alienated teen refrain, boosted by a talented cast and authentic soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The {{district}} of Akihabara in Tokyo, {{where there are}} maid cafes featuring waitresses who dress up and act like maids or anime characters, is a notable attraction center for otaku. Akihabara also has dozens of stores specializing in anime, manga, <b>retro</b> video games, figurines, card games and other collectibles. Another popular location is Otome Road in Ikebukuro, Tokyo. In Nagoya, students from Nagoya City University started a project on ways to help promote hidden tourist attractions related to the otaku culture to attract more otaku to the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. In 2010, it received awards for Most Challenging Game from IGN, and for Best Downloadable Game from GameSpot and GameTrailers. Critics lauded the game's precise control, <b>retro</b> artwork, and soundtrack. Reviewers generally praised the game's challenge, although some warned {{that not all}} players would appreciate the level of difficulty. The game was a commercial success, and sold {{more than one million}} copies as of January 2012. A sequel, Super Meat Boy Forever, is currently in development for release in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Ultimate itself {{released}} {{four more}} Filmation games. Alien 8 (1985) was rushed for release before developers {{had an opportunity}} to react to Knight Lore, though <b>Retro</b> Gamer said that its rush was not noticeable, as Alien 8 had a larger game world than Knight Lore, with even more puzzles. Alien 8 and Knight Lore are similar in gameplay, but the former is set in outer space. With the updated Filmation II engine, Nightshade (1985) added colour and scrolling graphics (in place of flip-screen room changes); however, <b>Retro</b> Gamer regarded its gameplay as comparatively dull. Gunfright (1986), reported as the Stampers' last game, also used Filmation II and was more robust than its predecessor. Pentagram (1986) returned to flip-screen rooms and its action-based gameplay included shooting enemies. It sold poorly and was the last Sabreman game. Meanwhile, the Stamper brothers sought to enter the burgeoning console industry. They sold Ultimate to U.S. Gold in the mid-1980s and established Rare to develop Nintendo console games. While Ultimate's last two isometric games were of lesser quality, consumer interest in the genre endured.|$|E
5|$|Williams shipped around 1,000units of Joust 2, {{significantly}} fewer than its predecessor. Brett Alan Weiss of Allgame and Mike Bevan of <b>Retro</b> Gamer attributed the poor numbers to an industry slump in the mid-1980s. Joust 2 arcade cabinets have since become fairly rare among collectors. Weiss negatively compared {{the game to}} its predecessor, calling Joust more popular and enjoyable. However, he commented that Joust 2s graphics are more detailed and robust.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} special paint {{jobs have been}} carried out. In the mid-1990s, SAS started a scheme to cover MD-80 in single colors {{overlaid}} with small, white aircraft silhouettes, but the project was abandoned after two aircraft. As SAS {{was one of the}} main sponsors of the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, it painted one aircraft in a Lillehammer '94 scheme. Similarly a Copenhagen '96 scheme was pained for Copenhagen's term as the European Capital of Culture. Since 2002, SAS has painted selected aircraft in a Star Alliance livery. With the delivery of the A319 in 2006, one aircraft was delivered in a <b>retro</b> Viking scheme.|$|E
5|$|After the Sequel was {{inspired}} by Sonic Heroes and other games {{both inside and outside}} the Sonic series, and it was developed with Sonic Worlds, an engine based in Multimedia Fusion 2 that reduces the amount of computer programming involved in game creation. It was released as a free download for Microsoft Windows personal computers. The game was very well received by video game journalists, who lauded its preservation of <b>retro</b> Sonic gameplay and its eclectic, 1990s-style soundtrack. The trilogy of Before the Sequel, After the Sequel, and their successor Sonic Chrono Adventure performed unusually well for fangames, having been downloaded 120,000 times by March 2014.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is a {{video game}} series created by game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto. It is published by Nintendo, with entries in the series developed by Nintendo, Rare, Namco, <b>Retro</b> Studios, and Paon. The series debuted in 1981 with the arcade game Donkey Kong, which was a sales success that brought Nintendo into the North American market. Most Donkey Kong games have either been arcade games or released for Nintendo consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to {{the current generation of}} video game consoles. However, some of the original arcade games were ported into versions on third-party home consoles and developed by several companies. Donkey Kong is among the best-selling video game franchises, with more than 48 million games sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Drive {{has been}} called a tough, hard-edged, neo-noir, art house feature, {{extremely}} violent and very stylish, with European art and grindhouse influences. According to Refn, Drive turns into a superhero film during the elevator scene when The Driver kills the villain. Drive also references 1970s and 1980s cult hits such as The Day of the Locust (1975) and To Live and Die in L.A. (1985). Other influences {{can be seen in the}} neon-bright opening credits and the <b>retro</b> song picks"a mix of tension-ratcheting synthesizer tones and catchy club anthems that collectively give the film its consistent tone". Drives title sequence is hot-pink, which was inspired by Risky Business (1983). Refn has also indicated that the film's romance was partly inspired by the films of writer-director John Hughes.|$|E
5|$|During the 55 {{nomination}} years, 153 {{authors have}} had works nominated; 40 {{of these have}} won, including coauthors and <b>Retro</b> Hugos. Connie Willis has received the most Hugos for Best Novella at four, and at eight is tied for the most nominations with Robert Silverberg. Willis and Charles Stross at {{three out of four}} nominations are the only authors to have won more than twice, while twelve other authors have won the award twice. Nancy Kress has earned seven nominations and George R. R. Martin, Kim Stanley Robinson, and Lucius Shepard six, and are the only authors besides Willis and Silverberg to get more than four. Robinson has the highest number of nominations without winning.|$|E
