5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first drying and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be <b>rinsed</b> thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. Drying the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after drying.|$|E

5000|$|Fluoride mouth <b>rinses</b> can be {{professional}}ly-applied by {{a dental}} professional or used at home. The most common fluoride compound used in mouth <b>rinse</b> is neutral sodium fluoride. Fluoride mouth <b>rinses</b> range from 0.05% to 0.2% (225-1,000 ppm) in concentration. The fluoride <b>rinse</b> with a 0.05% fluoride content {{is used for}} daily <b>rinsing,</b> while the <b>rinse</b> with 0.2% fluoride content is used for weekly <b>rinsing</b> and in school-based weekly <b>rinsing</b> programs. Fluoride at these concentrations is not strong enough for people {{at high risk for}} tooth decay. Regular use of a daily (230 ppm) or weekly (900 ppm) fluoride mouth <b>rinse</b> under supervision results into a reduction of tooth decay in children’s permanent teeth. [...] After a fluoride mouthrinse treatment, the fluoride in the mouthrinse is retained in the saliva which helps prevent tooth decay.|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to verify the impact of the final <b>rinse</b> technique on smear layer removal ability of 17 % ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). Methods: Sixteen single-rooted human teeth were instrumented and divided into 2 groups at the final <b>rinse</b> step according to the following final <b>rinse</b> techniques used: continuous <b>rinse</b> group, continuous <b>rinse</b> with EDTA during 3 minutes, and <b>rinse</b> and soaking group, <b>rinse</b> with 1 mL of EDTA, soaking of the canal for 2 minutes and 30 seconds, and <b>rinse</b> completion with the remaining 4 mL for 30 seconds. The specimens were split lengthwise and observed under scanning electron microscope. Results: Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn tests. The continuous <b>rinse</b> group presented more debris-free surfaces when compared with the <b>rinse</b> and soaking group (P. 05). Conclusions: It can be concluded that a continuous <b>rinse</b> with 5 mL of EDTA for 3 minutes can more efficiently remove the smear layer from root canal walls. (J Endod 2010; 36 : 512 - 514...|$|R

40|$|Background. Significant {{increases}} in intracranial pressure (ICP) may occur during neuroendoscopic procedures. To detect and prevent serious and sustained increases, ICP should be monitored. At present, controversy {{exists on the}} optimal location of the monitoring sensor. Therefore, we conducted an in vitro study to estimate the pressure gradients between the ventricle, the 'gold standard' site, and the <b>rinsing</b> inlet and outlet. Methods. A head model and a standard endoscope were used. <b>Rinsing</b> was enforced by using a pressurized infusion bag. Using clinically relevant flow rates, pressure was measured at the <b>rinsing</b> inlet and outlet, in the ventricle, and at the distal end of the <b>rinsing</b> channel using a tip sensor or a capillary tube. Results. At a flow of 61 ml min(- 1), the steady-state pressures measured at the <b>rinsing</b> inlet, in the ventricle, and at the <b>rinsing</b> outlet were 38, 26, and 12 mm Hg, respectively. At 135 ml min(- 1), these increased to 136, 89, and 42 mm Hg. Transendoscopic pressure measurements were always within 1 mm Hg of the ventricular pressure. Conclusions. During endoscopy, measurements at the <b>rinsing</b> inlet overestimated the ventricular pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg during heavy <b>rinsing,</b> whereas measurements at the <b>rinsing</b> outlet underestimated the pressure by similar to 50 mm Hg. An electronic tip sensor or a pressure capillary tube placed at the distal end of the lumen of the <b>rinsing</b> channel of the endoscope did not interfere with <b>rinsing</b> flow and produced measurements that were equal to ventricular pressures...|$|R

40|$|While oral <b>rinses</b> {{used for}} {{cosmetic}} purposes only {{do not necessarily}} have to be antiseptic, antimicrobial activity is required for medical indications, including oral and periodontal surgery. So the question arises—is the antimicrobial activity of oral <b>rinses</b> associated with any destructive changes in cell viability in vitro? To answer this question, we examined twelve oral <b>rinses</b> {{with respect to their}} antimicrobial and cytotoxic activity. Antimicrobial activity was screened against five bacterial strains using disc diffusion. Cytotoxicity was determined by mitochondrial reductase activity with primary gingival fibroblasts, L 929 cells, and HSC- 2 epithelial cells. Phase contrast microscopy and trypan blue staining were then performed to reveal cell morphology. Cells remained vital after exposure to oral <b>rinses</b> that were only used for cosmetic purposes. Moderate cytotoxic effects were observed for oral <b>rinses</b> containing 0. 05 % chlorhexidine, ethanol, or pegylated hydrogenated castor oil and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Other oral <b>rinses</b> containing 0. 2 % chlorhexidine and cocamidopropyl betaine exhibited strong cytotoxic and antimicrobial activity. Strong cytotoxic but moderate antimicrobial activity was observed in oral <b>rinses</b> containing cetylpyridinium chloride. The in vitro data show that oral <b>rinses</b> are heterogeneous with respect to their cytotoxic and antimicrobial effects. Based on their respective properties, oral <b>rinses</b> can be selected either to reduce the microbial load or for cosmetic purposes...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a <b>rinse</b> solution for prevention of ischemiareperfusion {{injury in the}} lung preserved for 24 hours was evaluated by using the canine isolated lung perfusion model. The heart and the lungs were harvested and preserved for 24 hours at 4 - 6 ℃ in modified:Euro-Collins(EC) solution. Prostaglandin El (100 p g) was adiministered into the pulmonary trunk prior to flushing canine lungs with preservation solution. The next day, left lungs were isolated with a perfluorochemical (FC- 43) or Carolina <b>rinse</b> II solution. Immediately after <b>rinsing,</b> the lung was reperfused with homologous venous blood (400 ml) for 120 min. in the experimental pump circulation system. The lungs were classified into the following six groups: Group 1 (n = 5), without <b>rinsing</b> (control group), Group 2 (n = 6), <b>rinsing</b> with oxygenated FC- 43 solution (250 ml), Group 3 (n = 4), <b>rinsing</b> with non-oxygenated FC- 43 solution (250 ml), Group 4 (n = 5), <b>rinsing</b> with pluronic F 68 solution (250 ml), Group 5 (n = 4), <b>rinsing</b> with the Carolina <b>Rinse</b> Solution a (250 ml) and Group 6 (n = 4). <b>rinsing</b> with the Carolina <b>Rinse</b> Solution 11 (250 ml) in addition with hydroxyethyl starch (50 g/l). Pulmonary vascular resistance and lung water volume (wet-dry/wet ratio) were lower and dynamic lung compliance was higher in Group 2 than in other groups. The tissue myeloperioxidase level in Group 2 was significantly lower than those in Groups 4, 5 and 6 (p < 0. 05). Histologically, severe marked lung edema was observed in Groups 1, 5 and 6. The lung showed almost normal architecture in Group 2. In conclusion, terminal <b>rinsing</b> with oxygenated FC- 43 solution immediatly before blood reperfusion is useful for prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury after 24 -hour cold ischemic storage in modified Euro-Collins solution...|$|R
