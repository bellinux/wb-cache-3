50|$|Half of the Ultra 80's memory must {{be fitted}} on the {{motherboard}} {{and the other}} half on a memory <b>riser</b> <b>board.</b> Care is needed in handling the memory <b>riser</b> <b>board,</b> as the connector is not designed for repeated use. It must be tightened using a torque wrench supplied with the Ultra 80, as detailed in the service manual.|$|E
50|$|Stairs usually {{consist of}} three components. They are the {{stringer}}, the tread and the riser. The stringer is the structural member {{that carries the}} load of the staircase, the tread is the horizontal part that is stepped on, and the <b>riser</b> <b>board</b> is the vertical part which runs {{the width of the}} structure. There are many types of stairs: open, closed, fully housed, winding, and so on, to mention a few of them.|$|E
50|$|Mounting {{hardware}} {{is a set}} {{of eight}} 10-32 UNF bolts, usually an Allen or Phillips head, and matching nylon locknuts. They are used to attach the trucks (and any type of <b>risers)</b> to the <b>board.</b> Some sets have one different colored bolt to show which side is the nose of the skateboard. Hardware is available in various lengths for mounting trucks with or without risers.|$|R
50|$|The Marsh Flow-Way, {{which is}} a {{constructed}} wetland, is located along the northwest shore of Lake Apopka and west of the Apopka-Beauclair Canal. It began operation in November 2003 and {{the goal of the}} project is to remove phosphorus and suspended material already in Lake Apopka water. The system covers approximately 760 acres and contains four individual wetland cells, in addition to levees, canals and ditches. The Marsh Flow-Way treats water pumped into it from Lake Apopka. The lake’s water has excessive amounts of phosphorus, algae and suspended matter. Water flows west to east and is controlled by screw gates and <b>riser</b> <b>boards</b> in the individual cells. Treated water from all cells collects in a pump basin, where water is pumped into the Apopka Beauclair Canal. Most of the cleaner, treated water returns to Lake Apopka, while the remainder flows downstream toward Lake County Water Authority’s nutrient removal facility (NuRF). Dominant vegetation communities growing in flow-way cells are shallow marsh and shrub swamp species. Shallow marsh includes species such as pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), arrowhead (Sagittaria lancifolia), cattail (Typha sp.), while shrub swamp includes primrose willow (Ludwigia peruviana), and some Salix spp. Open water areas are common in wetland cells. As incoming lake water passes through the Marsh Flow-Way’s emergent vegetation, the water’s flow rate slows and suspended particles, which contain phosphorus and other nutrients, settle out of the water column. The accumulating settled organic particles, along with settled decayed wetland vegetation, form new organic material layers, which overlay native soils. Retention time of lake water within the flow-way system typically ranges between two and seven days in the individual wetland cells. Water depths in the system can vary between 30 to 45 cm. Like all ecologically engineered systems, the performance of the flow-way is seasonally variable. Typically, best performance is in cooler months (October through May), while poorer performance is in warm months (June through September). During the long-term (seven years of operation), performance is similar to initial predictions. On the long-term (through 2010), the system removes about 28 percent (2.7 metric tons per year) of the incoming total phosphorus load, and about 90 percent (4,500 metric tons per year) of the incoming total suspended solid load.|$|R
