5|$|The series' January 15, 1981 debut, {{which was}} {{announced}} on October 22, 1980, occurred amid the industry's <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> the 1980 Actors strike and NBC's <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott.

Unlike other high-profile debuts from the 1980–81 network television season that had two- and three-hour premieres, such as Dynasty and Flamingo Road, this premiere episode debuted by itself as a one-hour offering.

40|$|Since {{the early}} 1990 s, <b>recoveries</b> <b>from</b> recessions in the US have {{been plagued by}} weak {{employment}} growth. We investigate whether a similar problem afflicts other developed economies, and whether technology is a culprit. We study <b>recoveries</b> <b>from</b> 71 recessions in 28 industries and 17 countries from 1970 - 2011. We find that though GDP recovered more slowly after recent recessions, employment did not. Industries that used more routine tasks, and those more exposed to robotization, did not recently experience slower employment recoveries. Finally, middle-skill employment did not recover more slowly after recent recessions, and this pattern was no different in routine-intensive industries...|$|R

5|$|After much contemplation, {{she chose}} not to abdicate. Joseph himself often {{threatened}} to resign as co-regent and emperor, but he, too, was induced not to do so. Her threats of abdication were rarely taken seriously; Maria Theresa believed that her <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> smallpox in 1767 {{was a sign that}} God wished her to reign until death. It was in Joseph's interest that she remained sovereign, for he often blamed her for his failures and thus avoided taking on the responsibilities of a monarch.|$|E

Although she has made an almost full <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> the incident, late in 2009 she was still suffering from minor symptoms in hands and feet related to nerve injury.

40|$|The {{taxability}} of recoveries of damages {{on account}} of emotional distress remains a complicated issue under the American federal income tax law.

Congress can, and in fact does tax such recoveries and the constitutional basis of such power can hardly be doubted. As a result, appropriate changes in the statute only can bring the desirable result of exempting such <b>recoveries</b> <b>from</b> income taxation...|$|R

40|$|A gas chromatographic {{method for}} the {{analysis}} of 10 organochlorine pesticides in 0. 5 mL of whole blood is described. Sample preparation involved an ethyl ether and hexane extraction, followed by a silica solid phase extraction cleanup. The pesticides are quantified by gas chromatography/electron capture detection. Method limits of detection ranged from 1. 1 to 5. 2 μ g/L. The mean and standard deviation for the recovery of 10 pesticides was 97. 9 (5. 5 %. <b>Recoveries</b> <b>from</b> whole blood were comparable to <b>recoveries</b> <b>from</b> plasma.

Both magazines were monthly, with Gernsback as editor-in-chief and David Lasser as editor. Lasser had no prior editing experience and knew little about science fiction, but his recently acquired degree from MIT convinced Gernsback to hire him.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, the {{introduction}} of the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) by British settlers in the 19th century led to significant reductions in loggerhead sea turtle populations. In one coastal section in eastern Australia during the 1970s, predation of turtle eggs destroyed up to 95% of all clutches laid. Aggressive efforts to destroy foxes in the 1980s and 1990s has reduced this impact; however, it is estimated that it will be the year 2020 before populations will experience complete <b>recovery</b> <b>from</b> such dramatic losses.|$|E
