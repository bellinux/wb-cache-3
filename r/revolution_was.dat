Ridge Racer <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> re-released in Japan for the PlayStation The Best {{range in}} June 1997, and for the Platinum Range in PAL regions the {{following}} year. The game received generally positive reviews, although some criticised its similarity to the original. Ridge Racer <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> followed by a sequel, Rage Racer, in 1996.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>revolution</b> <b>was</b> quelled, the old flags were {{restored}} and the revolutionaries punished for having worn the tricolor. In 1849, domnitor Barbu Dimitrie Ştirbei adopted a new design for military colors that nevertheless preserved the colors’ horizontal layout and only changed decorative elements. Similar to the 1834 flag, this one lasted until 1856.|$|E

5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> marked by a massive boom in the textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, spinning progressed much more rapidly than weaving.|$|E
5|$|At release, 1979 <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> well {{received}} by critics, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} narrative, characters and performances, and historical representations, though some criticism was directed at the quick-time sequences and visual quality. The game was also criticized by an Iranian journalist who declared it as propaganda. Khonsari felt afraid to reenter Iran as a result, {{and other members of}} the development team adopted aliases for protection. The game was nominated for multiple year-end accolades from several gaming publications.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1790, Habsburg Austria {{ended its}} {{war with the}} Ottoman Empire and {{prepared}} to suppress the Brabant revolutionaries. The new Holy Roman Emperor, Leopold II, a liberal like his predecessor, proposed an amnesty for the rebels. After a Statist army was overcome at the Battle of Falmagne, the territory was quickly overrun by Imperial forces, and the <b>revolution</b> <b>was</b> defeated by December. The Austrian reestablishment was short-lived, however, and the territory was soon overrun by the French during the French Revolutionary Wars.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{defeat in}} World War I, Hipper retired on 13 December 1918 from {{the navy and}} lived a quiet life; he {{received}} a full war pension. During {{the chaos of the}} German Revolution of 1918–1919, Hipper hid from radical revolutionaries by assuming a false name and moving frequently. He wrote a letter to Adolf von Trotha, the new fleet commander, expressing his approval of the scuttling of the German fleet in Scapa Flow on 21 June 1919. After the <b>revolution</b> <b>was</b> over, Hipper moved to a house in Altona near Hamburg.|$|E
5|$|Initially, the Brabant <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> {{also able}} to {{continue}} unthreatened {{because of the lack}} of external opposition. Soon after the revolution started, Joseph II had fallen ill. Following its defeats at the hands of the patriot army in the initial campaign, the only Austrian force in the region, taking refuge in Luxembourg, could not challenge the rebels alone. The ongoing conflict with the Ottoman Empire also meant that the bulk of Austria's own army could not be spared to put down the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|May25 was {{designated}} as a patriotic date in 1813, but the Argentine Declaration of Independence suggests July9 as an alternative national day. At first this added to the conflicts between Buenos Aires and the provinces during the Argentine Civil War, because the date in May related to Buenos Aires and the date of July9 related to the whole country. Thus the unitarian Bernardino Rivadavia canceled the celebration of July9, and the federalist Juan Manuel de Rosas allowed it again, but maintained the May celebrations. By 1880, the federalization of Buenos Aires removed the local connotations and the May <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> considered {{the birth of the}} nation.|$|E
50|$|A minimal {{surface of}} <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> a subtype of minimal surface. A minimal surface is defined {{not as a}} surface of minimal area, but as a surface with a mean {{curvature}} of 0. Since a mean curvature of 0 is a necessary condition of a surface of minimal area, all minimal surfaces of <b>revolution</b> <b>are</b> minimal surfaces, but not all minimal surfaces are minimal surfaces of revolution. As a point forms a circle when rotated about an axis, finding the minimal surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to finding the minimal surface passing through two circular wireframes. A physical realization of a minimal surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> soap film stretched between two parallel circular wires: the soap film naturally takes on the shape with least surface area.|$|R

5|$|Over the {{following}} months, the population radicalized itself, and, on September 18, 1848, {{just one week}} before the <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> crushed, crowds entered the Interior Ministry, taking over the official copies of Regulamentul Organic and the register of boyar ranks (Arhondologia). The documents were subsequently paraded through the city in a mock funeral cortege, and burned down, one sheet at a time, {{in the public square}} on Mitropoliei Hill. Neofit reluctantly agreed to preside over the ceremony and to issue a curse on both pieces of legislation.|$|E
5|$|Prince Rainier III was {{responsible}} for not only turning around the fortune and reputation of Monaco but also for overseeing {{the restoration of the}} palace. Upon his accession in 1949 Prince Rainier III immediately began a program of renovation and restoration. Many of the external frescoes on the courtyard were restored, while the southern wing, destroyed following the French <b>revolution,</b> <b>was</b> rebuilt. This is the part of the palace where the ruling family have their private apartments. The wing also houses the Napoleon Museum and the archives.|$|E
40|$|While {{theorists have}} {{scrutinized}} {{the causes of}} revolution, they have avoided systematic study of its consequences. This paper counters such neglect {{in a number of}} ways. Rival models of the effects of <b>revolution</b> <b>are</b> developed. To make testing of these competing models possible, <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> conceived of as an experimental treatment in an interrupted time-series design. Utilizing this design, economic data on the Cuban <b>Revolution</b> <b>are</b> analyzed. The findings reject three leading models of revolutionary effects-the Conservative, the Marx-ist, and the Thermidorian. Instead, the results hint that the economic effects of <b>revolution</b> <b>are</b> neither as pervasive nor as disruptive as com-monly supposed, {{at least in the short}} run.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} ban on {{opposition}} to the NRP, Daoud began a massive purge of Parchamites in government. Mohammad lost his position as interior minister, Abdul Qadir was demoted, and Karmal was put under government surveillance. To mitigate Daoud's suddenly anti-communist directives, the Soviet Union reestablished the PDPA; Taraki was elected its General Secretary and Karmal, Second Secretary. While the Saur Revolution (literally the April <b>Revolution)</b> <b>was</b> planned for August, the assassination of Khyber led to {{a chain of events}} which ended with the communists seizing power. Karmal, when taking power in 1979, accused Amin of ordering the assassination of Khyber.|$|E
5|$|That's why I say {{the players}} didn't stab the ACB in the back.

It wasn't really surprising then that more than 50 players from around the world signed lucrative WSC contracts and a <b>revolution</b> <b>was</b> born. About half of the WSC players were from Australia and this high ratio can, in part, be attributed to Bradman's tight-fisted approach to the ACB's money.|$|E
5|$|The French <b>Revolution</b> <b>was</b> {{integral}} {{to the expansion of}} French cuisine, because it abolished the guild system. This meant anyone could now produce and sell any culinary item he wished. Marie-Antoine Carême was born in 1784, five years before the Revolution. He spent his younger years working at a pâtisserie until he was discovered by Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-Périgord, who would later cook for Napoleon Bonaparte. Prior to his employment with Talleyrand, Carême had become known for his pièces montées, which were extravagant constructions of pastry and sugar architecture.|$|E

40|$|A new {{algorithm}} for {{ray tracing}} surfaces of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> presented. The {{objective is to}} improve the computation cost and data structure during the intersection determination between a ray and a surface of revolution. As a preprocessing step, a surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> subdivided into a series of simple primitives. We experimented our method with two subdivision schemes. In the first subdivision scheme, a surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> approximated by bounded cones. The offset curve of a surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> subdivided into linear segments. A series of bounded cones is produced by revolving these linear segments around the axis of rotation. The second subdivision scheme uses revolute quadric surfaces to reconstruct a surface of revolution. The offset curve is approximated by connected conic sections. These conic sections are converted to a series of coaxial revolute quadric surfaces by revolving the conic sections around the axis of rotation. After a surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> subdivided into bounded cones or revolute quadric surfaces, a binary bounding volume tree structure is built and used for finding the intersection between a ray and the surface of revolution. Calculating the intersection of a ray and a surface of <b>revolution</b> <b>is</b> then reduced to a simple tree searching routine with the data structure. Further reduction of the processing time can be achieved by using range searching and adaptive bounding volumes for the surfaces...|$|R
