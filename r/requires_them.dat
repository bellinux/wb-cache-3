5|$|In , Sora's group stumbles upon a {{fortress}} known as Castle Oblivion, believing {{they will find}} Mickey and Riku inside. There, Sora's memories are manipulated by a girl named Naminé, who is being held captive by the group Organization XIII and forced to replace his memories of Kairi with herself. However, as Sora ascends the castle, he meets Naminé and learns the truth from her. Sora still wishes to protect Naminé and stop the Organization members in the castle. After Sora and friends defeat the Organization members controlling the castle, Naminé helps the three restore their memories to their state prior to entering Castle Oblivion, {{at the cost of}} their memories of the events in the castle. This <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to sleep in the castle for the restoration of memories to be completed.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E

25|$|However, names {{similar to}} Alan (e.g. Aryan and Iron) were clearly used by distantly-related Iranian tribes in very {{different}} historical contexts and {{the identification of the}} Alans with the Asii <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to have migrated more than 2,800 kilometres (1,750 miles) in the space of several decades. According to archaeologist Claude Rapin, {{it is unlikely that the}} Asii of Bactria migrated further west than Kangju/Sogdia.|$|E
25|$|In her youth, she was {{abducted}} by Theseus. A competition between her suitors {{for her hand}} in marriage sees Menelaus emerge victorious. An oath sworn beforehand by all the suitors (known as the Oath of Tyndareus) <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to provide military assistance {{in the case of}} her abduction; this oath culminates in the Trojan War. When she marries Menelaus she is still very young; whether her subsequent involvement with Paris is an abduction or a seduction is ambiguous.|$|E
25|$|Soilless growing media: exfoliated {{vermiculite}} {{is combined with}} other materials such as peat or composted pine bark to produce soilless growing media for the professional horticulturalist and for the home gardener. These mixes promote faster root growth and give quick anchorage to young roots. The mixture helps retain air, plant food, and moisture, releasing them as the plant <b>requires</b> <b>them.</b> These mixes were pioneered by Boodley and Sheldrake. Exfoliated vermiculite is also used as a growing media for hydroponics.|$|E

His decision allows the Bnei Menashe to immigrate as Jews to Israel under the country's Law of Return.

25|$|On February 6, 2014, Meehan {{introduced}} the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards Program Authorization and Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4007; 113th Congress), {{a bill that}} would make permanent the United States Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS’s) authority to regulate security at certain chemical facilities in the United States. Under the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS) program, DHS collects and reviews information from chemical facilities in the United States to determine which facilities present security risks and then <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to write and enact security plans.|$|E

Debates {{on whether or not}} the skirts were “too short” and that shirts and trousers were “too tight” were amongst the multitude of reasons that nearly half of the sixth form girls across Years 12 and 13 were sent home to change.|$|E

25|$|Braun and Gearhart {{note that}} {{although}} unions do {{participate in the}} structure of a number of these agreements, their original interest in codes of conduct differed from the interests of human rights and other non-governmental activists. Unions believed that codes of conduct would be important first steps in creating written principles that a company would be compelled to comply with in later organizing contracts, but did not foresee the establishment of monitoring systems such as the Fair Labor Association.

25|$|In some jurisdictions, good Samaritan laws only {{protect those}} who have {{completed}} basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations, such as the American Heart Association, or American Red Cross, provided that they have acted {{within the scope of}} their training. In these jurisdictions, a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and who performs first aid incorrectly, can be held legally liable for errors made. In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally. In Florida, paramedics, EMTs, and Emergency Medical Responders (First Responders) are required by law to act under the Duty to Act law, which <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to stop and give aid that falls within their practice.|$|E
25|$|In Germany {{the term}} Schnellstraße (expressway) refers to roads that allow higher speed traffic than is common on other roads. This in turn <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to have dual carriageways in most cases. An {{exception}} is the 2+1 road system in some rural areas; these roads are {{also referred to as}} expressways (three lanes on a single carriageway where overtaking in a lane designated for oncoming traffic is prohibited, so that a speed restriction is not required to increase safety—they are generally built to a 100 or 120km/h traffic standard). This is based on the definition of expressways as having an increased amount of grade-separated sections. Technically a dual carriageway with central reservation is the legal foundation that no blanket speed limit exists—comparable to the German autobahn - but expressways are often given speed limit signs.|$|E

25|$|All Home Office {{police forces}} {{have access to}} air support, often {{in the form of}} helicopters. Some forces also have small fixed wing aircraft. Police Helicopters are {{required}} by the CAA to be marked in a standard 'high conspicuosity' paint scheme, to make them more visible and avoid the possibility of air proximity hazards with other low flying aircraft. This paint scheme, also used by UK military training helicopters, <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to be black on the sides and underneath, and yellow on top. When seen from the ground, these helicopters are black but this is to make them more visible against the sky as a safety feature (and yellow against the ground when seen from above). One of the most common helicopters used by the police is the Eurocopter EC135.|$|E
25|$|Low {{offers to}} travel to Spacetime Six to show the aliens how to return, but this <b>requires</b> <b>them</b> to repower the portal that was used. They are able to {{retrieve}} two life crystals from a machine that generates them, but Low and Brink fight over the crystals, and Brink falls to his death. During the process of opening the portal, Robbins is killed. The player has the option of reviving Robbins with a life crystal after the portal is opened; however, if they do, she immediately jumps to her death, with no crystals left to revive her a second time. With no other options, Low uses the portal to meet {{the rest of the}} aliens in Spacetime Six; with the portal open, the aliens can perceive the route home and return to Cocytus. They restore Brink and Robbins to life and cure Brink of his addiction to the crystals, though this leaves him as an elderly man. If Low left Robbins dead, she is happy to see him, but if Low revived her, she is angry and scorns him. As promised, the aliens reconstruct a spacecraft for the humans, and representatives of the species join the humans as they return to Earth.|$|E
