40|$|LecturePg. 7 - 18 The {{importance}} of correlating rotordynamic analytical results to actual test data has become extremely important in recent years. Many user specifications require the verification of vendor generated analytical results {{in conjunction with}} shop unbalance testing. This correlation generally includes critical speed, amplification factor, and vibration magnitude. Several problems arise during shop unbalance testing. First, {{it is not always}} feasible to place an unbalance test weight in a location where it will logically excite the mode in question. This can lead to test runs where, despite a large unbalance weight, the <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> is more influential than the test weight. Thus, the resulting rotor vibration is controlled by the <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> and not the test unbalance. Consequently, any type of analytical correlation for this situation is extremely difficult. Another problem with test stand data is that it usually comes from four different vibration probe locations. This results in four vibration plots and, in many cases, four different critical speeds, amplification factors, and vibration magnitudes. Again, the analytical correlation for this situation is extremely difficult, since determining the actual values for these parameters is somewhat nebulous. These problems are addressed herein and a solution is offered. Several examples of analytical and test stand results are presented for steam turbines and centrifugal compressors. These examples highlight and discuss the problem areas identified. A method is presented for subtracting the vibration due to <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> from that of the verification test. The resulting vibration with residual subtraction isolates the effect of the unbalance weight, and leads to improved correlation with analytical predictio...|$|E

The objective of balancing is to reduce rotor vibration to a practical minimum. Reducing rotor vibrations generally increases the service life of the rotating machinery.

Due to the unbalance in the impeller, vibration occurs and leads to decrease in fluid velocity and local pressure which may cause an undesirable turbulence and possible cavitation. Hence, to remove the unbalance in rotor is necessary. In this paper the focus is given on dynamic balancing of centrifugal pump impeller.

The objective of this investigation is to develop a hybrid experimental/analytical technique for balancing high-speed flexible rotors.

Different modeling techniques were taken into account for this purpose. Such models are recommended for flexible couplings to analyze their influence on the natural frequencies of the system and on the unbalance response of the system.

In this paper, the details of the experimental evaluation of the static stiffness of typical cantilevered type of damper rings through static loading and dynamic excitation technique, and some aspects regarding the study of the effects of a few important dimensionless geometric and operating parameters related to squeeze film dampers on dimensionless energy dissipative capacity of such damping devices are discussed. It is also observed that the ring behaves more like one with a fixed-constrained end condition rather than a fixed-free one. The energy dissipative capacity of the squeeze film damper can be enhanced by increasing the dimensionless load which can easily be altered by monitoring the external oil supply pressure which also incidentally controls the damper to operate in a 'no cavitation zone', thus implying that an increase in dimensionless load would result in higher damping compared to the increase in bearing plane stiffness...|$|E

In the LoWash EU project, Vibratec {{is in charge}} to design, to build and to validate a balancing system for reducing the vibrations at high spin-drying speeds. The system is based on two trolleys rolling in a ring linked to the drum. The trolley shape allows a ring cross section optimization and they are equipped with a mechanism for escaping the disadvantage encountered at low speeds by similar devices.

40|$|Rotating shafts are {{employed}} in industrial machines such as steam and gas turbines, cryogenic turbo expanders, turbo generators, internal combustion engines, centrifugal compressors for power transmission. On account of the ever increasing demand for power and high speed transportation, the rotors of these machines are made extremely flexible to allow bending. The shafts of these machines are subjected to torsional and bending vibration {{and in some cases}} unstable condition of operation. These machines can develop excessive stress in torsion because of low torsional natural frequencies of the system involving flexible couplings. Determination of natural frequencies and mode shapes is thus important from design point of view. Lateral bending and subsequently whirling of a rotor may arise due to <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> (present due to corrosion, material inhomogeneity etc.) which would cause the simple circular shaft on rigid supports carrying concentrated masses experience synchronous whirl and when the shaft runs at a speed equal to its natural frequency in lateral bending, the whirling becomes predominant.

As the resonance occurs the shaft develops stresses violently, causing the shaft to fail suddenly or decreasing its life.

40|$|Abstract: The {{balancing}} of rotors divides broadly {{into two}} categories: balancing in situ and balancing in a balancing machine. In the latter case, {{the most common}} practice is to arrange balance corrections on the rotor such that the net excitations {{of each of the}} four in-plane rigid-body modes of the free rotor is zero by deploying balance corrections on two independent planes. In a small proportion of cases, the net excitations of the rst pair of exural modes are also zeroed using a third correction plane. This paper proposes that, when rotors are balanced in a balancing machine (not similar to the machine stator), substantially more utility can be gained from the balancing operation by combining a suitably weighted account of the speci c balancing requirements of the machine with knowledge of the expected machine characteristics than can be achieved by ignoring this knowledge. A single cost function is established based on a numerical model of the machine. Then, depending on circumstances, either the expected value of this cost function or its worst possible value can be minimized. The methods proposed require that relatively detailed knowledge of the distribution of <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> be obtained experimentally.

But, as present industrial need is moving towards a very high speed (supercritical) and light weight drivelines, it is important to use on-line balancing techniques instead of off-line balancing. Therefore, present work is focused on the on-linebalancing of a rotor system by estimating the distributed unbalance parameters with the help of active magnetic bearings (AMBs). The flexible rotor model having helicallydistributed unbalances along its length and supported by two conventional bearing at both ends is well thought-out here for the analysis. Two active magnetic bearings are considered to generate controlling force for suppressing the unbalance. Then, an equivalent discretized modelis formulated by utilizing seven numberof mass-less thin discs having an eccentricity equivalent to distributed unbalance in theflexible rotor. The finite element approachhas been used to obtain a unified model.

Equation of motion of the system hasbeen derived by considering only linear DOFs at bearing locations as generalized coordinates. Displacement at various nodes as well as current signals at AMB locations are calculated by using MATLAB Simulink.

40|$|Rotating {{machinery}} is extensively used in {{the industry}} today. The dynamics of rotating machines and the critical issues associated with them have been the principal focus of {{a large part of}} the research and development in industry in recent times. The rotating machines are one of the most essential components of machinery in industry as they play a vital role in the process of transferring power from one place to another. The assemblies of the important industrial machinery such as gas turbines, compressors, hydroelectric systems, locomotives, vehicles etc. are made of different rotating parts. Therefore it becomes necessary to analyze the dynamic behavior of the rotating systems in order to understand the level of stresses to which these components are subjected to during their operation. This pre-design phase analysis can greatly contribute to the trouble shooting of the critical issues. However, the dynamic behavior of rotating machinery is quite complex which necessitates the need for understanding the mechanics behind the operation of these devices thoroughly. The complexity of the analysis increases further whenever there is an unbalance in the rotating components which leads to an undesirable whirling response. The gyroscopic effects present in the rotating disks amplify at higher rotating speeds of shafts thereby inducing some undesirable stresses in the components. Due to the complexity of these rotating structures, they are subjected to stresses during the industrial processes. So, it becomes necessary to perform the vibration analysis for predicting their behavior prior to their application phase. This analysis would be of great aid in determining the natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of the system. Initially, a free vibration analysis is carried out which is followed by the forced vibration analysis to predict their behavior when subjected to the excitations arising from the <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> and any other external excitations. The primary goal of this dissertation is to analyze the dynamic behavior of the industrial rotors and address the critical issues associated with them. Initially, a simple Jeffcott rotor is analyzed in detail to determine its natural frequencies, critical speeds from the Campbell diagram, the forward and backward whirl modes. This is followed by the analysis of an actual industrial rotor in ANSYS in order to understand its dynamic behavior which involves the detailed analysis of the Campbell diagrams, critical speeds, effect of the gyroscopic moments etc. The phenomenon called ‘Curve veering’ was observed from the inspection of the obtained natural frequencies of the system and discussed.

Essentially a small turbo machine, the rotor is mounted upon two plain (gas) air bearings, which are flexibly supported by elastomeric ' 0 '-Rings. The project objectives were to investigate, experimentally and theoretically, the mechanism of dynamic instability, half frequency whirl (HFW) observed in the C. A. U design, and hence evaluate methods by which it can be best controlled. Two main areas of study were embarked upon. Firstly a steady state aerodynamic study, based on an existing single bearing rig, to evaluate the extent of aerodynamic operation and single bearing instability (HFW). This Test Rig did not have ' 0 '-Ring flexibility. Bearing L/D tested were 2, 1. 5 and 1. 0, with variable loading of 18 - 1 -º 51. 2 N and speeds of 6000 -º 40000 Rpm in approximately 5000 Rpm intervals. the theoretical study investigated non-linear effects of air film pressure distribution. Secondly a Dynamic instability study of HFW was carried out on a newly designed Test Rig, simulating small turbo machines and the C. A. U [...] Three bearing types were evaluated, Aerodynamic, Hybrid and Hybrid porous. With L/D of 1. 0. ' 0 '-Ring Centres varied from 0. 17 4 0 - 83 of bearing length. Viton and Silicon materials were tested with 70 shore hardness. Rotor mass, inertia, asymmetry and unbalance were investigated along with ' 0 '- Ring stiffness and damping variation from air pressure (0 4 120 psi). Theory was developed to determine whirl onsets and effects of unbalance, and damping of the support. Non-linear (stagnant areas) of air film detected experimentally, are not explained by Raimondi's theory. Experiments show that Raimondi's theory seriously over estimates the applicable area of fully developed aerodynamic operation. Pressure Profile at onset of Instability tends to a Sommerfeld condition. Temperature was a good indication of lubrication regime. Linear temperature rise curve denotes Aerodynamic operation, and transition to non-linear curve represents onset of Instability (HFW). Authors theory considers non-linearity of air film and suggests a new method of evaluation to improve convergence. Dynamic study of dual bearing rig concludes, first instability onset speed (RSW) can be passed through due to <b>residual</b> <b>unbalance</b> and damping in the ' 0 '-Ring support. Theory developed shows relationship of RSW and HFW effects due to unbalance and damping and results agree well. Viton offered better damping than Silicon. RSW not present in Viton at' 0 '-Ring centres above 10 mm. HFW not present with Viton below 55, 000 rpm. RSW observed with ui /cu = 1. 0 and HFW occurred with m /m = 0 - 493 4 0. 58. hybrid porous bearings had lower performance than hybrid, but better than aerodynamic. Hybrid bearings mounted in Viton ' 0 '-Rings offer best performance long term. Aerodynamic bearings can be concluded to be inherently unstable and have limited aerodynamic operation, so should see little use in high speed turbo machinery, including C. A. U. or aircraft applications where zero g loading likely...|$|E
