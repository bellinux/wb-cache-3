50|$|Scale {{modeling}} also {{occurs in}} O and <b>S</b> <b>scales,</b> {{just like in}} HO or N scales, where the modeler tries to create a miniature world that is as realistic as possible. Scale modelers in O and <b>S</b> <b>scales</b> will often avoid, or at least make limited use of, traditional American Flyer and Lionel locomotives and rolling stock since it sometimes was not very true to scale, was lacking in detail, and used oversized knuckle couplers. Scale modelers use O gauge track, but with two rails rather than the three rails used by Lionel, and the trains run on direct current. Numerous standards for track that is more true to scale exist for both O and <b>S</b> <b>scales.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For angles {{from around}} 5.7 up to 90 degrees, sines are found by {{comparing}} the <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> with C (or D) scale; though on many closed-body rules the <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> relates to the A scale instead, and what follows must be adjusted appropriately. The <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> has {{a second set of}} angles (sometimes in a different color), which run in the opposite direction, and are used for cosines. Tangents are found {{by comparing the}} T scale with the C (or D) scale for angles less than 45 degrees. For angles greater than 45 degrees the CI scale is used. Common forms such as [...] can be read directly from x on the <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> to the result on the D scale, when the C-scale index is set at k. For angles below 5.7 degrees, sines, tangents, and radians are approximately equal, and are found on the ST or SRT (sines, radians, and tangents) scale, or simply divided by 57.3 degrees/radian. Inverse trigonometric functions are found by reversing the process.|$|R

50|$|SDRs (Software Defined Radios) {{acquire and}} process signals differently, and {{determine}} S-readings by direct measurement of RF signal amplitude. Consequently, many SDR systems with bit depths of 14-bits or more are accurately calibrated {{from one end}} of the <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> to the other right out of the box. In cases where this is not so, a few minutes with a signal generator to set the reference level are all that is required. Low bit depth SDRs such as an 8-bit design can be somewhat accurate, but as they distinguish much coarser differences in input levels, precision at the low end of the <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> will suffer.|$|R

50|$|From {{the late}} 1940s to the mid-1960s, 1:64 {{was a popular}} scale in the U.S. model {{railroad}} market, where it was called <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> or <b>S</b> gauge, however it still remains a popular scale, with a dedicated following. A.C. Gilbert, a major toy manufacturer, challenged the predominant O scale (1:48) manufacturers such as Lionel with a fully developed line of 1:64 scale and semi-scale equipment marketed under the American Flyer brand. Because they were 25% smaller than traditional O scale models, they ran on two-rail track that was more realistic than the traditional 3-rail O gauge track. These features would become standard characteristics of model trains in later years, when the even-smaller HO scale (1:87) took over the model train market from both the O and <b>S</b> <b>scale</b> trains.
