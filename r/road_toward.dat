5|$|Markway becomes {{alarmed at}} Eleanor's {{obsession}} with Hill House {{in spite of}} the dangers it poses for her. Despite Eleanor's pleas to stay, Markway insists that she leave at once and asks Luke to accompany her home.

Luke observes it seemed that Eleanor deliberately aimed the car at the tree, but Markway asserts that something was in the car with her.
