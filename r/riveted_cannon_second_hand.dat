This paper concentrates on the current <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> market for fashion products and presents the different motives toward <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> consumption as well as alternative consumption channels for <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> products. The findings of the paper are founded on literature research of academic articles and case studies. Results {{show that there is}} a high potential for the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> market due to the increasing interest of consumers in buying <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> products. The paper concentrates on the <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> market for fashion products in the western society. This means that there was no research on <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> products for disadvantaged people in poor countries. Furthermore, the paper focuses the formal <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> retail channels to see what is already on the market...|$|R

This method of driving the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> is called indirect center seconds. Because the gearing was outside the plates, it added to the thickness of the movement, and because the rotation of the third wheel had to be geared up to turn the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> once a minute, the <b>seconds</b> <b>hand</b> had a fluttering motion.|$|R

In short, <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> goods exist {{in relation to a}} production that is mediately by the first cycle of consumption and are intrinsically connected to practices that reveal the work of consumption. Then, the paper analyzes the fashion of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> like a typical case of reusing practises.

This {{study investigated the}} remnant data on <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> memory cards that were purchased through Australian <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> auction websites throughout 2013. Memory cards continue to increase in capacity and are used in both smart phones and tablet computers as persistent storage. During this study a total of 140 <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> memory cards were purchased throughout 2013. Each memory card had its data recovered and subsequently analysed. The results show that sellers are sending memory cards with no evidence of erasure; poor attempts to erase data; or simply asking the buyer to erase the data prior to use. The data recovered is not only of a personal nature, but also appears to originate from Australian government departments and business. It is evident that actions must be taken by <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> auction sites, and the media to raise awareness and educate end users on how to dispose of data in an appropriate manner...|$|R

40|$|The <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> {{and vintage}} clothes market is {{increasing}} and the attitude and {{perception of the}} clothes are changing. Demographic age groups are important driving forces for change of attitudes and values. The purpose of the thesis {{is to get a}} better understanding of the MeWe generation, people born in the mid 80 ’s, as a driving force behind the increasing interest in second hand/vintage clothes. In this thesis their values are connected with their attitudes and motivations towards <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> and vintage clothes consumption. Qualitative method has been used and interviews with five representatives of the MeWe generation have been conducted. As a theoretical framework the survey of the MeWe generation by Lindgren et al is used along with research about <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> and vintage clothes. The conclusion of the thesis is that the MeWe generation can be considered to be an important driving force behind the growing <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> and vintage market. Their attitudes towards <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes can be explained by their values. In this thesis the concepts of individuality, authenticity and post-materialism is in focus. They are important traits of the MeWe generation and can be used to explain the shifting perception of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> clothes and the growing market...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigated the}} perception of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> vehicle leasing in the New Zealand market. Vehicle leasing in New Zealand is currently an area which is under-developed. Also majority of the privately leased vehicles in New Zealand are <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> vehicles. Therefore, {{the perception of}} vehicle leasing in the New Zealand market is vastly {{different from the other}} markets, which were used as a basis for comparison in this study. Through the course of the research, five perceived values of leasing a <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> vehicle were determined. These perceived values found were simplified maintenance, cost effectiveness, ease of leasing, easy to manage budget and maximization of cash in hand, and vehicle value estimation. The result of this research showed utilitarian factors which determine significant value to <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> vehicle lessees. It was found that simplified maintenance determined the greatest value to New Zealand vehicle lessees. This research is expected to contribute to the body of knowledge in the consumer behaviour field, through investigation of the perceived value of <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> vehicle leasing in an under-developed vehicle leasing market. This is important as the New Zealand market is expected to have a large potential for <b>second</b> <b>hand</b> vehicle leasing. Therefore, this research can assist the New Zealand leasing companies to better understand their potential customers, and thus allowing the companies to refine their strategies and tactics...|$|R
