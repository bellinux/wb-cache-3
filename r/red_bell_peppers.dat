40|$|Crude {{avocado oil}} {{is similar to}} olive oil and {{contains}} health-beneficial compounds such as tocopherols and phytosterols. Capsanthin is the major carotenoid present in the <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annuum L.) and {{is used as a}} natural food colorant with biological activity. In order to combine the benefits of both and to produce capsanthin-rich avocado oil using a clean extraction technology, freeze-dried avocado and <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> pulps were separately packaged in a single fixed bed extractor, in which supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO(2)) was passed through the bed at 50 degrees C and 400 bar. The target compounds were simultaneously extracted from both sources, the first source containing lipids and the second source rich in capsanthin. The scCO(2) passed first through the avocado pulp containing 68 % lipids, and then that were passed through the <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> pulp contained 625 mu g/g capsanthin. Lipids extracted in the first bed served as co-solvent with CO 2 in the extraction of capsanthin in the second bed. An extract consisting of intensely red-colored oil containing 280 - 460 mu g/g capsanthin was obtained. In the process, around 88 % avocado oil and from 30 % to 50 % capsanthin from <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> were extracted. The pepper pulp extraction without using oil as a co-solvent resulted in 1 % yield of a concentrated extract containing 11, 000 mu g capsanthin per gram extract, but with only 15 % recovery, corresponding to the extraction of 100 mu g capsanthin from a total of 625 mu g capsanthin per gram of freeze-dried <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper.</b> (C) 2015 Elsevier B.

50|$|The {{most common}} colors of bell peppers are green, yellow, orange and red. More rarely, brown, white, lavender, and dark purple peppers can be seen, {{depending}} on the variety. Most typically, unripe fruits are green or, less commonly, pale yellow or purple. <b>Red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> are simply ripened green peppers, although the Permagreen variety maintains its green color even when fully ripe. Green peppers are less sweet and slightly more bitter than yellow or orange peppers, with <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>peppers</b> being the sweetest. The taste of ripe peppers can also vary with growing conditions and post-harvest storage treatment; the sweetest fruits are allowed to ripen fully on the plant in full sunshine, while fruit harvested green and after-ripened in storage is less sweet.|$|E

50|$|Though {{there are}} only a few {{commonly}} used species, there are many cultivars and methods of preparing chili peppers that have different names for culinary use.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the eff ects of irradiation from light-emitting diodes (LEDs) on several fruits during storage. To improve storage and increase the contents of some bioactive compounds, apple, tomato and <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> fruits were exposed to yellow light emitted from the diodes at 590 nm. The contents of ascorbic acid, total phenolics, total flavonoids and several pigments were investigated, along with the antioxidant potential. The colour parameters (L*, a* and b*) and firmness of the fruit were also determined. After 7 days of LED light irradiation, there was significantly higher total phenolic content and antioxidant potential in apple peel extracts. The irradiated fruit of tomato had significantly higher levels of total phenolic compounds, and the fruit of <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> had significantly higher antioxidant potential. LED light had no effects on the colour parameters, although there was a tendency to accelerate colour development. Apple fruit irradiated with LED light was significantly less firm. Among twelve analysed pigments, significantly more β-carotene was detected in LED light-irradiated apple and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit, more α-tocopherol and γ-tocopherol in <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit, and more lutein in apple peel and <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> fruit. The applied LED light slightly accelerated the ripening of the studied fruit, and affected the synthesis of some of the secondary metabolites...|$|R
40|$|The {{ultrastructure}} and carotenoid-bearing {{structures of}} mamey sapote (Pouteria sapota) chromoplasts were elucidated using light and {{transmission electron microscopy}} and compared to carotenoid deposition forms in <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> (Capsicum annuum) and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Globular−tubular chromoplasts of sapote contained numerous lipid globules and tubules embodying unique provitamin A keto-carotenoids in a lipid-dissolved and presumably liquid-crystalline form, respectively. Bioaccessibility of sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin was {{compared to that of}} structurally related ketocarotenoids from <b>red</b> <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> and salmon. Capsanthin from <b>bell</b> <b>pepper</b> was the most bioaccessible pigment, followed by sapotexanthin and cryptocapsin esters from mamey sapote. In contrast, astaxanthin from salmon was the least bioaccessible ketocarotenoid. Thermal treatment and fat addition consistently enhanced bioaccessibility, except for astaxanthin from naturally lipidrich salmon, which remained unaffected. Although the provitamin A keto-carotenoids from sapote were highly bioaccessible, their qualitative and quantitative in vivo bioavailability and their conversion to vitamin A remains to be confirmed.
