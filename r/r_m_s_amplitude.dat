40|$|Summary. This Report {{gives an}} account of the {{experimental}} measurement of the power spectra of waveforms derived from vibrating blades in axial compressors under running conditions. This enables the damping factor of the blades to be found, and these damping factors agree reasonably well with theoretical estimates of the aerodynamic damping. There is no significant decrease in the damping factor when the blades stall. The Report includes theoretical estimations of the length of data which has to be examined to get accurate measurements of the <b>R.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>amplitude</b> and the power spectrum. The amount of data required is much greater for the power spectrum, but even for the <b>R.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S.</b> <b>amplitude</b> it is surprisingly long. The Report also includes a theoretical prediction of the effect of variations of air density and blade material density under otherwise similar conditions. 1. Introduction. On...|$|E

40|$|Two {{algorithms}} based of trajectory ®tting {{have been}} used to ob-tain rapidly a circulating beam in LEP with strong focusing lat-tices. A new algorithm called ªorbit closureº uses the beam posi-tions measured at the ®rst and the second turn. From their dif-ference, it computes two corrector strengths per plane such that the second turn passes at the same place as the ®rst turn at about ten BPM locations. This produces a closed orbit amplitude with an r. m. s. value close to that of the ®rst turn trajectory. A new '®rst turn threader ' has been tried. It detects places where an oscillation with an <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>amplitude</b> larger than a speci-®ed value starts, and computes two corrector strengths to cancel it. By iterating this process, {{it should be possible to}} correct by steps the ®rst turn trajectory so that its <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>amplitude</b> is below a speci®ed value. The orbit closure has been applied with success to a very low emittance lattice (135 in the horizontal plane) in LEP. I. The principles These algorithmsare based on the ®ttingmethod.

Fore-and-aft acceleration was measured at the seat guide of a small automobile when driving over two representative road surfaces, and was replicated in a laboratory setting using a whole-body vibration test rig and rigid seat. A single 15 -second section {{of each of the}} two acceleration time histories was band-pass filtered to the frequency interval from 0. 5 to 50. 5 Hz, and was used as a base stimulus. Thirteen test stimuli were then constructed for each base stimulus by rescaling to BS 6841 Wd frequency-weighted <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>amplitudes</b> from 0. 01 to 0. 86 m/s 2. Two groups of 16 participants (8 male and 8 female in each case) rated the discomfort of the test stimuli.

The order of presentation of the test stimuli was fully randomised and each was repeated 3 times. For each group of participants, regression analysis was used to determine both the individual and the group mean Stevens’ Power Law exponent describing the relationship between stimulus amplitude and subjective response.

40|$|Four {{campaigns of}} the Worldwide Atmospheric Gravity-wave Study (WAGS) {{have taken place}} in the European sector. On many {{occasions}} the onset of auroral activity in the evening and midnight sector, as indicated by EISCAT measurements of the electric field, was associated after a suitable delay with the detection of periodic ionospheric disturbance travelling southward over the U. K. at speeds between 500 and 1000 m s− 1. The velocity and wavelength of the TIDs corresponded to large-scale atmospheric gravity-waves. The characteristic periods of the travelling disturbances were similar to the intrinsic time scales of the auroral activity for periods of 40 min or more, but variations on a time scale of 20 min or less were strongly attenuated. The <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>amplitude</b> of the auroral electric field was proportional to the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>amplitude</b> of the HF Doppler-shift associated with the gravity-wave. The time-lag between the onset of strong auroral activity and the arrival of the travelling disturbance over the U. K. was usually about an hour, suggesting a source region about 2000 km north. Similar levels of activity in the afternoon did not appear to produce strong waves in the far field. This is possibly due to ion-drag in the daytime ionosphere although the effects of the lower sensitivity of the HF Doppler-network during daytime must also be considered...|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the sources}} {{responsible}} for reionizing the Universe {{is a key}} goal of observational cosmology. A discrepancy has existed between the metagalactic hydrogen ionization rate, Gamma_HI, predicted by early hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest if scaled to appropriate assumptions for the IGM temperature, when compared to values predicted from the proximity effect. We present new estimates for Gamma_HI in the redshift range 2 <z< 4 based on hydrodynamical simulations of the Lyman-alpha forest opacity. Within the current concordance cosmology, and assuming updated QSO emissivity rates, a substantial contribution to the UV background from young star-forming galaxies appears to be required over the entire redshift range. Our {{results are consistent with}} lower-end estimates from the proximity effect.

The ability to identify location, type {{and size of the}} defects are always necessary to save time and cost. Thus, this research project embarks on identifying defect location and estimating the size of the defect by using Acoustic Emission (AE) technology. Data were acquired from a two inch diameter pipe with 1 mm thickness using low cost piezoelectric sensors. Location of the defect was estimated based on the difference on the time arrival coming from the two sensors. Results show that location of the defect can be estimated within certain degree of accuracy. In addition, different sizes of the defect have also been studied using artificially induced defect as well as the actual defect. Defects have been introduced both in the axial and radial direction on the test pipe. AE data from the pencil break has been collected for each defect size and processed using few AE parameters such as <b>R.</b> <b>M.</b> <b>S.,</b> energy, <b>amplitude</b> and time-frequency domain. All of these data were then normalized to the reference value and the correlation between defect sizes and normalized AE parameters were developed. The results show that there are good correlations between normalized AE parameter and defect sizes particularly when the defect size was increased in axial direction. In short, it is shown that AE technology is capable in locating defect in pipeline as well as giving estimation {{on the size of the}} defect...|$|R

Root-mean-square (<b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.),</b> myoelectric signal <b>amplitudes</b> were computed for each of four jaw elevators.

During painless and painful function, <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> activities did not differ statistically when elevators acted as agonists on both the dominant and non-dominant chewing side (p > 0. 1).

Variability in maximum gape was greater during painful than painless function (p = 0. 001), but peak maximum gapes in complete masticatory sequences were not affected by pain, and neither were minimum interocclusal gapes.

Fifteen subjects were tested while seated in a driving posture. Four equal sensation tests and one annoyance threshold test were performed using sinusoidal excitation at 18 frequencies in the range from 3 to 315 Hz. In order to guarantee the generality of the equal sensation data the four tests were defined to permit checks of the possible influence of three factors: reference signal amplitude, psychophysical test procedure and temporary threshold shift (TTSv) caused by the test exposure. All equal sens ation tests used a reference sinusoid of 63 Hz at either 1. 0 or 1. 5 m/s 2 <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> in <b>amplitude.</b> The four equal sensation curves were similar in shape and suggested a decrease in human sensitivity to hand-arm rotational vibration with increasing frequency.

A frequency weighting, called Ws, was developed for the purpose of evaluating steering wheel rotational vibration. The proposed Ws has a slope of 0 dB per octave over the frequency range from 3 to 6. 3 Hz, a slope of - 6 dB per octave from 6. 3 to 50 Hz, a slope of 0 dB per octave from 50 to 160 Hz and a slope of - 10 dB per octave from 160 to 315 Hz.

40|$|Primordial {{magnetic}} fields (PMF) damp at scales {{smaller than the}} photon diffusion and free-streaming scale. This leads to heating of ordinary matter (electrons and baryons), which affects both the thermal and ionization history of our Universe. Here, we study the effect of heating due to ambipolar diffusion and decaying magnetic turbulence. We find that changes to the ionization history computed with recfast are significantly overestimated when compared with CosmoRec. The main physical reason for {{the difference is that}} the photoionization coefficient has to be evaluated using the radiation temperature rather than the matter temperature. A good agreement with CosmoRec is found after changing this aspect. Using Planck 2013 data and considering only the effect of PMF-induced heating, we find an upper limit on the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> magnetic field <b>amplitude</b> of B 0 < 1. 1 nG (95 % c. l.) for a stochastic background of PMF with a nearly scale-invariant power spectrum.

Our results are important for the derivation of constraints on the PMF power spectrum obtained from measurements of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies with full-mission Planck data. They may also change some of the calculations of PMF-induced effects on the primordial chemistry and 21 cm signals. Comment: 7 pages, 4 figures, submitted to MNRA...|$|R

We develop a semi-analytic model to examine temperature fluctuations resulting from inhomogeneous HI and incomplete HeII reionizations. There are two main motivations for this investigation. First, detection of these fluctuations might {{provide insight into the}} reionization histories of hydrogen and helium. Second, these fluctuations, neglected in previous analyses, could bias constraints on cosmological parameters from the Ly α forest. The inhomogeneous reionization of HI results in temperature fluctuations, since different regions in the IGM, reionized at different cosmic times, have different temperatures at lower redshift.

40|$|In the {{standard}} Cold Dark Matter (CDM) theory {{for understanding the}} formation of structure in the universe, there exists a tight connection between the properties of dark matter (DM) haloes, and their formation epochs. Such relation can be {{expressed in terms of}} a single key parameter, namely the halo concentration. In this work, we examine the median concentration-mass relation, c(M), at present time, over more than 20 orders of magnitude in halo mass, i. e., from tiny Earth-mass microhalos up to galaxy clusters. The c(M) model proposed by Prada et al. (2012), which links the halo concentration with the <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> <b>amplitude</b> of matter linear fluctuations, describes remarkably well all the available N-body simulation data down to ~ 10 ^(- 6) Msun microhalos. A clear fattening of the halo concentration-mass relation towards smaller masses is observed, that excludes the commonly adopted power-law c(M) models, and stands as a natural prediction for the CDM paradigm. We provide a parametrization for the c(M) relation that works accurately for all halo masses. This feature in the c(M) relation at low masses has decisive consequences e. g. for gamma-ray DM searches, as it implies more modest boosts of the DM annihilation flux due to substructure, i. e., ~ 35 for galaxy clusters and ~ 15 for galaxies like our own, as compared to those huge values adopted in the literature that rely on such power-law c(M) extrapolations. We provide a parametrization of the boosts that can be safely used for dwarfs to galaxy cluster-size halos. Comment: Eight pages, 2 figures. MNRAS accepted versio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{effects of}} {{seat-back}} angle and accelerometer height at the seat-back on seat-back x-axis frequency-weighted root-mean-square (<b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.)</b> acceleration {{have been investigated}} in field experiments. Experiment 1 investigated the range and variability, of frequency-weighted <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> acceleration at the same measurement position, where the seat-back angle was 24 degrees from vertical {{on the floor and}} the accelerometer height was 38 cm up from the seat cushion surface. Experiment 2 investigated ranges of frequency-weighted <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> acceleration between the reference position, which was the position used in experiment 1, and test positions at different seat-back angles, 4 degrees ahead of and 4 degrees behind the reference position. Experiment 3 investigated the range of frequency-weighted <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> acceleration between the reference position which was the same as in experiments 1 and experiment 2, and test positions at different accelerometer heights at the seat-back from a seat cushion surface, 2. 5 cm higher, 2. 5 cm lower and 5 cm lower than the reference position. This investigation clarifies that different seat-back angles and accelerometer heights at the seat-back affect the frequency-weighted <b>r.</b> <b>m.</b> <b>s.</b> acceleration at these measurement positions, which is beyond the exposure values at which people are able to distinguish different vibration acceleration magnitudes...|$|R
