5|$|The {{long history}} of {{agricultural}} production, coupled with modern intensive agricultural methods such as pesticide and fertiliser use and runoff from contaminants into streams, <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes,</b> impact the natural fresh-water ecosystems and have placed pressure on biodiversity in Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{ceramics}} on the Altiplano {{started in the}} Herrera Period, with the oldest evidences of ceramic use dated at 3000 BP. The many different clays of the <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> of the valleys on the high plateau made a variety of ceramic types possible.|$|E

Market quarters are scattered like stars. Many <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> flow through , refreshing and purifying it.|$|E
40|$|The ESA <b>River</b> <b>and</b> <b>Lake</b> Pilot {{project has}} now been running for some time, {{generating}} <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>lake</b> heights for targets globally. This paper presents a synopsis of the current system for generating <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>lake</b> heights from EnviSat Near Real Time (NRT) data and outlines a series of proposed enhancements, including extension of the NRT capability to ingest Jason- 1 data. Results from a global analysis of system outputs is given, together with validation results against gauge data. The results demonstrate that very good time series are being recovered from the EnviSat NRT system, and that the current severe filtering of waveform shapes might be relaxed to some extent without significant loss of quality in the output, permitting many more <b>river</b> <b>and</b> <b>lake</b> measurements to be generated...|$|R

5|$|This widely {{distributed}} neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum. The coloration {{pattern on the}} shell is very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in brackish water, in <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> on stones. It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms.|$|E
5|$|Hippopotamus lemerlei bones {{have been}} mostly {{discovered}} in the <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> of western Madagascar, suggesting a riparian lifestyle, {{very similar to that}} of the modern hippopotamus of modern Africa. H. lemerlei also shared the high-orbits that make it easier for the hippopotamus to see while in the water. The skull of H. lemerlei also resembled that of the modern hippopotamus, but with consistent size differences, indicating that H. lemerlei was a sexually dimorphic species.|$|E
5|$|M. rugustus, M. yaotunensis, and M. lashuyuanensis are {{all known}} from the Nanxiong Basin in Guangdong. This {{formation}} was deposited primary from streams, <b>rivers,</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> in that region. It spans across the K/T boundary, at which point most of the dinosaur eggs disappear, but Macroolithus apparently exists {{on both sides of}} the boundary (which would imply that some species of dinosaurs survived into the early Tertiary). However, sedimentological evidence suggests that these fossils were actually reworked by debris flows into the Tertiary rocks.|$|E

5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, and prairie dogs. The state bird, the ring-necked pheasant, has adapted well to the area after being {{introduced}} from China. Growing populations of bald eagles are spread throughout the state, especially near the Missouri River. <b>Rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, bass, and other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish.|$|E
5|$|Mammals in {{this area}} include bison, deer, pronghorn, coyotes, beavers, and prairie dogs, while {{reptiles}} include the snapping turtle, the box turtle, and various types of snakes. The prairie rattlesnake is South Dakota's only venomous snake. <b>Rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> of the grasslands support populations of walleye, carp, pike, and bass, along with other species. The Missouri River also contains the pre-historic paddlefish, and chinook salmon, native to the Pacific Northwest, have been successfully introduced in Lake Oahe.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} {{cetacean}} live in <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes,</b> but are {{more closely related}} to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently. Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments. These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin, Orcaella brevirostris, found in the Mekong, Mahakam, the Irrawaddy Rivers, as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis.|$|E

5|$|The Northwest Power and Conservation Council {{divides the}} Kootenay River {{watershed}} into six biomes: aquatic (<b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes),</b> riparian zones, wetlands, grassland/shrubs, moderately wet forest, and dry forest. The forested zones extend through the alpine and subalpine {{reaches of the}} watershed, while grasslands dominate the low terraces and plateaus surrounding the river, especially in the Lake Koocanusa area and the Montana-Idaho portion of the watershed. In the Canada portion of the watershed, an alpine meadow ecozone occupies most of the high ridges and valleys of the mountains.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Death Valley Pupfish swam to the area from the Colorado River via a long-since dried-up system of <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> (see Lake Manly). They now live in two separate populations: one in Salt Creek and another in Cottonball Marsh. Death Valley {{is one of the}} hottest and driest places in North America, yet it is home to over 1,000 species of plants; 23 of which, including the very rare Rock Lady (Holmgrenanthe petrophila), are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife abounds in the valley, {{particularly}} the water birds around the <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes,</b> with Chew Valley Lake considered {{the third most}} important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including ducks, shoveller (Anas clypeata), gadwall (Anas strepera) and great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), {{a wide variety of}} other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as tits (Paridae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) to mistle thrush (Turdidae). Larger birds include woodpeckers (Picidae) and common buzzard (Buteo buteo).|$|E

5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. This situation is typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|The text {{asserts that}} fresh water is Amrita (nectar) of cuisine, and Visha (poison) otherwise. Someshvara III {{recommends}} fresh water from rains (autumn), springs (summer), <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> (winter) for daily use, {{after it has}} been filtered with a clean cloth. The text recommends boiling the water before use and using the water so in a day. For drinking, if boiling is not possible, the text recommends alternate purification method based on Triphala, and then adding a piece of mango, patala or champaka flower or powder of camphor for flavor and delight. The text mentions fresh coconut water and drinks called Panakas.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> become too small or dry up completely.|$|E

5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes,</b> The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground bird that is often seen in the alpine zones. <b>Rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
5|$|Manitoba is {{bordered by}} the {{province}}s of Ontario {{to the east and}} Saskatchewan to the west, the territories of Nunavut to the north, and Northwest Territories to the northwest, and the US states of North Dakota and Minnesota to the south. It adjoins Hudson Bay to the northeast, and is the only prairie province to have a saltwater coastline. The Port of Churchill is Canada's only Arctic deep-water port and the shortest shipping route between North America and Asia. Lake Winnipeg is the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Hudson Bay is the world's second-largest bay. Manitoba {{is at the heart of}} the giant Hudson Bay watershed, once known as Rupert's Land. It was a vital area of the Hudson's Bay Company, with many <b>rivers</b> <b>and</b> <b>lakes</b> that provided excellent opportunities for the lucrative fur trade.|$|E
