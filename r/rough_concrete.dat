25|$|The {{buildings}} of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph {{beginning in the early}} 1960s, to distinguish the campus from the outside world and provide what might be considered a Social Utopian environment. The building architecture {{is similar to that of}} the Boston Government Service Center. Rudolph made both the exterior and interior of each building of <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> (béton brut), an essential element of the style known as Brutalism, and he endowed buildings with large windows, with the intended effect of giving those inside the feeling of being connected to the outdoors. The stairs were made relatively short in height, ostensibly in order to slow people down and thus allow them to appreciate the campus more fully. Atriums were also placed in the Liberal Arts and Science & Engineering buildings to give people a place to socialize between sections of the halls. These areas are also filled with hanging and potted indoor plants. The main door of each building faces towards the Robert Karam Campanile, keeping students within the academic life area, where buildings for classes are located. Large mounds of earth (berms) also stand between the parking lots, making the lots partially invisible from within the original Academic Life area (though not from within some recent additions to it, such as the Charlton College of Business building). More recent buildings, most notably the Woodland Commons and residence halls to the south of the main campus, have been built to complement, but not to attempt to copy, Rudolph's Late Modernist aesthetic.|$|E
2500|$|Lining the {{perimeter}} walls to Brookes Street and Gregory Terrace are horse stables. The stables are in long timber buildings with skillion roofs clad with corrugated iron. The buildings comprise {{back to back}} stalls and are arranged with narrow [...] "lanes" [...] between them. The holding capacity must be well over a hundred horses and the individual accommodation is fairly standard – each has a concrete floor, single door and window space filled with a metal grille. The concrete has been roughed up by stamping a rough lattice pattern into it over most areas. There is a horse washing area against the wall where the floor is <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> and pebble and the bays are divided by vertical corrugated metal panels.|$|E

Built {{on the same}} model as the [...] " [...] Gheorghe Bogdan [...] " [...] house of [...] The apartment house is unfortunately disfigured by unsightly modern windows, a partial <b>rough</b> <b>concreting</b> of the railing of the main balcony, originally built in wrought iron, as well as large picture windows destroying the harmony the architect had imagined. The two entrances {{on the ground floor}} have also been simplified, losing completely their original style. A photograph of the building was published in the [...] journal in 1924, probably shortly after its construction.|$|R

The cave is 10-20 meters wide and nearly the same height throughout, with numerous speleothems including stalagmites, flowstone, and rimstone pools. It has electric lighting with <b>rough</b> paths, <b>concrete</b> steps, and iron bridges.|$|R
60|$|We did {{not have}} time to ask any {{questions}} before we heard the sentry coming up the stairway, which was near our corner. When he reached the top, he walked away from us over toward the Indian barracks, which were on the ramparts, {{at the other end of}} the fort. As soon as he reached the barracks, Maiden's Heart took me by the arm and Rectus by the collar, and hurried us to the stairway, and then down as fast as we could go. He made no noise himself, but Rectus and I clumped a good deal. We had to wear our shoes, for the place was paved with <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> and oyster-shells.|$|E

50|$|The surface crib {{room and}} stores are located {{next to the}} {{headframe}} and shaft. It consists of a small, three roomed building, rectangular in plan view, with a wooden frame clad with corrugated iron and <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> floors. It has a skillion roof. A space of approximately 0.5m between the north wall and the roof is in-filled with mesh.|$|E
50|$|There is a <b>rough</b> cast <b>concrete</b> {{and brick}} pier {{retaining}} wall to both street frontages. Entry {{to the ground}} floor is via a set of stairs built into the retaining wall on the northern side. Levels two and three are accessed via a timber stair and porch on the eastern side.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has seven tiers and is constructed of angled, painted, pre-cast concrete panels with reticulation, a textured finish that displays curvilinear forms. The building displays some {{characteristics of the}} Brutalist style of Modern architecture, which is distinguished by weighty, massive forms; <b>rough,</b> exposed <b>concrete</b> surfaces; broad, expansive wall planes; and recessed windows.|$|R
40|$|Architects {{nowadays}} demand impeccable aesthetic {{qualities of}} demoulded <b>rough</b> <b>concretes.</b> New mix designs are increasingly complex, and a concrete mix characterization often limits the workability attributes, in {{the aim of}} providing an assessment of concrete behavior {{at the time of}} its placement. The aesthetics of concrete facings however also depend on the actual mix design, location and release agents used. This study focuses on analyzing the influence of self compacting concrete (SCC) and the choice of release agent on the evolution of frictional stresses at the concrete/formwork interface. A follow-up study has been conducted on the aesthetic quality of facings between an SCC and a concrete with additives, including mix designs with both mineral and vegetable oil. An analysis of shading color was also carried out over three periods, namely: 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days...|$|R
50|$|The Gasworks {{were still}} extant—although derelict—in the early 1980s, when Stanley Kubrick's team came {{scouting}} for {{an area that}} could double for the battle scenes in his 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. The Gasworks <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> structures were painted with Vietnamese script, and then strategically dynamited so as to resemble war-torn Hue. Retail parks now cover most of the Gasworks site.|$|E
50|$|Outside {{of larger}} city {{areas such as}} Damascus, Aleppo or Homs, {{residential}} areas are often clustered in smaller villages. The buildings themselves are often quite old (perhaps a few hundred years old), passed down to family members over several generations. Residential construction of <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> and blockwork is usually unpainted, and the palette of a Syrian village is therefore simple tones of grays and browns.|$|E
50|$|In his 45 {{years of}} {{professional}} career Haq has designed more than 300 buildings. He admits that, at his young age, {{the works of}} Alvar Aalto inspired him most. Haq's architectural style is celebrated for holding cultural roots, respecting local context, urban sustainability {{and the use of}} natural light and air. His designed buildings are characterized by extensive use of tactile materials such as hand made brick, <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> and natural woods.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the third}} floor is a high, top-lit {{auditorium}} with a roof canopy and a curved, enclosing wall, {{in addition to a}} generous lobby. The east and west facades are in the form of sun breakers or brise-soleil, one of Corbusier’s many formal inventions, which, while avoiding harsh sun, permit visual connection and air movement. While the brise-soleil act as free facades made of <b>rough</b> shuttered <b>concrete,</b> the north and south sides, built in rough brickwork, are almost unbroken.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to study the {{development}} of biofilms on coupons exposed to wastewater in sewers. The coupons are made of different materials (glass, PMMA, concrete, brick). They are analysed by image analysis to evaluate the amount of biofilm attached to them. The relations between opacity or darkness {{and the number of}} days the coupons have been immersed in the wastewater show that biofilm detachment is easier from smooth surface (glass, PMMA) than from <b>rough</b> ones (<b>concrete,</b> brick...|$|R
50|$|The {{influence}} of Le Corbusier may be discerned in the <b>rough</b> plastered <b>concrete</b> work, exposed concrete beams {{and the way}} the interior is dramatized by light brought into the building by high windows. Precedents may be seen at both Ronchamp and Sainte Marie de La Tourette. Care is taken to clearly express the junctions of different materials by negative detailing and the projection of beams past their point of support. The use of diagonal symmetry, gridded planning and modular dimensions all relate the building to both high modernism and classical architecture.|$|R
5000|$|The depot {{is located}} in {{downtown}} Montrose, and is described as an [...] "architectural bright spot". It has a Mission Revival design, characterized by the arcades, terra cotta tile roof, and curvilinear parapets. It is a one-story structure, approximately rectangular, with main facades along the east (street side) and west (track side). Two chimneys protrude from the roof. The lower 48 in of the exterior is concrete with a wainscot appearance, above which is <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> stucco.|$|E
5000|$|I-59 from Gadsden at mile marker 182 to Stephen's Gap at mile marker 193 had {{degraded}} {{over the}} decades since it was opened into a <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> highway. Between 2010 and 2014, a construction project called [...] "Project 59" [...] took place between Gadsden and Fort Payne. This project consisted of reconstructing the Interstate Highway with unbonded concrete (without any space cracks) as well as modifications to the width and vertical clearance of the bridges and overpasses in the segment.|$|E
50|$|The Wells Fargo Plaza is a {{high-rise}} skyscraper located on 100 West Washington Street in Downtown Phoenix, Arizona, United States. It opened as the First National Bank Plaza on October 25, 1971, {{and was later}} known as the First Interstate Bank Building. It is 372 feet (113 m) tall. It is designed in the Brutalist style, an architectural style spawned from the International Style. The “raw concrete” element of Brutalist architecture allows for no exterior finish which exposes the <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> columns and beams.|$|E
50|$|In March 2013, Todd coordinated a {{construction}} job fair for workers skilled in mechanical, electrical, plumbing, <b>concrete,</b> <b>rough</b> carpentry, masonry, roofing, and waterproofing in Fort Totten Square. On June 5, 2013, Todd was elected {{chair of the}} Ward 4 Democrats. He launched a new web site and Twitter account for the organization. In 2014, he was Finance Director for Bowser's mayoral campaign.|$|R
5000|$|The {{structural}} frame is of <b>rough</b> reinforced <b>concrete.</b> The {{panes of glass}} located on the three exterior faces, the so-called [...] "pans de verre ondulatoire" [...] ("undulating glass surfaces"), were designed by Xenakis, and {{are similar to those}} of the Secretariat at Chandigarh on which Xenakis also worked. On the other hand, in the garden-court of the cloister, the fenestration is composed of large concrete elements reaching from floor to ceiling, perforated with glazed voids and separated from one another by [...] "ventilators": vertical slits covered by metal mosquito netting and furnished with a pivoting shutter. The corridors leading to the dwelling cells are lit by a horizontal opening located under the ceiling.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was designed in a Romanesque Revival architectural style by Weeks, {{the architect of}} several other Northern California Carnegie libraries. The seven room, single story plus basement {{building was}} constructed by Wilkerson using dark gray man-made stone, plus both <b>rough</b> and smooth <b>concrete</b> blocks, fabricated on location. It features a dark brick facade, now painted white, and a partially exposed cement foundation. A cement stairway leads from {{the road to the}} arched doorways.|$|R
50|$|During the Barnard's {{occupation}} {{the interior}} of the original cottage remained relatively unchanged. When the Barnard's sold the property in 1958 it passed through a number of hands and underwent some alterations. The back verandah was enclosed sometime during the late 1950s and the original timber flooring was removed, leaving the main bedroom with a <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> floor and the living area with a dirt floor. The mantels over the central fireplace were also removed at some point and the wall separating the two bedrooms demolished, effectively changing the cottage from 3 rooms to 2.|$|E
50|$|The {{exterior}} of the building was <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> that bore the markings from the wooden forms used to create the walls. The street entrance on Hopkins Plaza led to a stairway that took patrons to the lobby on the second floor. The exterior lobby wall was glass while interior walls had a faux wood finish or were covered with burnt-orange vinyl. The plaza-level entrance was framed by towers holding stairs and elevators to access the balcony. The stage house was clearly defined as a separate element attached to the auditorium.|$|E
50|$|The {{people who}} {{gathered}} in Dheisheh originated {{from more than}} 45 villages west of Jerusalem and Hebron. Dheisheh {{is one of the}} refugee camps that was created as a temporary humanitarian {{solution to the problem of}} accommodating those expelled Palestinians. Towards the end of the 1950s the UNRWA started to build very simple living units: A single room of 10 square metres, 10 cm thick and 2.45 m high walls, a steel roof and a floor made of <b>rough</b> <b>concrete.</b> Refugees began to build their own houses so as not to live in the UNRWA's shacks any longer.|$|E
50|$|Construction began of {{the current}} Parkland in 2000 and the parkland {{opened to the public}} in 2001. The complex legal issues were handled by Freehills {{partners}} Michael Back and Christopher Blue. The project won its first award before it had opened: a commendation in the Cement and Concrete Association of Australia Streetsmart awards for the innovative concrete finishes created by the use of coloured concrete and an apparently random pattern of <b>rough</b> cast <b>concrete</b> generated by the formworkers which makes the finish appear to change through the day depending on the angle of the sun and the length of shadows cast by the detailing on the walls. The technique was created through a design and construction collaboration between project designers PARC managing contractor Abigroup and the Queensland Department of Public Works.|$|R
50|$|The {{single-storeyed}} timber church, with timber buttresses, {{has been}} clad with fibrous cement sheeting and sprayed with a <b>rough</b> finish <b>concrete</b> render. The building has a steep pitched gable roof, a twin gable transept, sprocketed eaves, asbestos cement tiles laid in a diamond pattern and a sheet metal spire surmounted by a cross {{over the south}} end of the nave. A small apse extends to the north with a vestry to the west and a store with a corrugated iron roof to the east. A timber kindergarten room, clad in the same material, with a steep pitch gable roof is attached to the north. The building has narrow lancet hopper windows, with leadlight panels to the nave and transept, concrete stumps to the perimeter and a timber and asbestos cement tile hood to the north nave round window.|$|R
30|$|The {{fact that}} {{the second set of}} {{specimen}} though less rough than the first but with a friction angle greater than the first could be an indication of the Evolution law proposed by Zhang and Zhang [4]. This affirms that there could be particle breakage or strain hardening at high normal stress value, in the shear zone which could lead to increase in frictional resistance between the soil and concrete which is manifested by larger friction angle than that given by the <b>rougher</b> set 1 <b>concrete</b> specimen.|$|R
50|$|The tower {{takes up}} {{an entire city}} block. The {{footprint}} {{is similar to a}} 3 leaf clover and its stem. The stem is the narrow elevator core on the southern facade. It has a <b>rough,</b> <b>concrete</b> texture and is the tallest portion of the tower. The remaining exterior is a glass panel curtain wall. The west leaf, or wing, stand at 34 floors followed by the north wing at 38 floors and the east wing at 36 floors. Unlike many traditional skyscrapers with zero-setback retail/lobby space on the ground floor, access to the tower is through an underground restaurant/retail concourse set a comparatively large distance away from the bordering streets.|$|E

The only {{basketball}} and volleyball courts {{are those of}} <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> located at the public schools' estates. they were often open in the afternoon for the public, but those sports are no longer played in Nizao.Like the whole Dominican Republic, baseball is the king sport. Nizao has a baseball field that has been under construction since the last 20 years.Nizao has produced {{a huge number of}} professional baseball players, among them, Efrain Valdez, Julio Valdez, Rafael Valdez, Felix Perdomo, Carlos Valdez, Sandi Santiago, Wilson Valdez, Deivi Cruz, Rafael Cruz, Vladimir Guerrero, Wilton Guerrero, Jesus Sanchez, Ketel Marte and more prospects navigating through the Baseball Minor Leagues farm system.|$|E
5000|$|The {{elevation}} {{is mostly}} concrete, albeit differing in textures and directionality: smooth concrete lines the façade in a horizontal manner, the <b>rough</b> <b>concrete</b> lining vertically. The steel-framed windows are situated onto the bays {{protruding from the}} façade, and are reminiscent of overhanging towers in medieval castle architecture. Ironically, the bay windows seem to elevate upwards, opening up the two lowermost levels into voids enclosed with steel-framed glazing, making these elements seem lighter than they really are. To stretch further one’s imagination, {{it is as if}} these elements are elevators that transport the [...] "scholars anxious to escape the noise and turmoil of the vulgar press into… a dream palace enshrining in its holy mysteries the power of the word." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{little green}} empire on the roof, making {{a mockery of}} the usual <b>rough</b> and rugged <b>concrete</b> terrace also mocks at the main {{misconception}} connected with gardening - that gardening is the monopoly of the aristocratic with sprawling acres, plenty of money to spend on manure, saplings and gardeners.This garden is looked after by the family themselves without any professional gardener on duty which is a matter of pride and pleasure for them. This also leads to another fascinating hobby of ornithology, because of the innumerable birds coming in, thanks to the flowers and fruits.|$|R
50|$|Arbel {{launched}} his own building design practice (OAO) in 2005. Since {{then he has}} completed several commercial and residential projects, including 23.2, a freestanding house located in South Surrey, B.C, Canada.Arbel’s architectural projects reflect his emphasis on materials. For example, 23.2 was designed with triangular geometry to avoid altering the key material of the project: 100-year-old Douglas Fir beams, some 20 metres long and 90 centimetres deep. 23.2 received considerable attention from the design community, and was shortlisted for a World Architecture Award in 2010. Arbel was awarded the Ron Thom Award for Early Design Achievement the same year. Other built projects include a penthouse composed of onyx “pods,” a design store centered on <b>rough</b> poured <b>concrete,</b> and a restaurant featuring {{one of the first}} installations of 38, a horizontal chandelier made of glass and copper wire. Arbel has been shortlisted for the World Architecture Award three times and continues to explore design at the building scale through the physical properties of building materials.|$|R
40|$|Skids {{have been}} used at various times for {{aircraft}} landing gear ever since the Wright Flyer appeared in the early 1900 's. Typically, skids have been employed as aircraft landing gear either at low speeds or at lowbearing pressures. In this investigation, tests were conducted to examine the friction and wear characteristics of various metals sliding on a <b>rough,</b> grooved <b>concrete</b> runway. The metals represented potential materials for an overload protection skid for the Space Shuttle orbiter. This report presents data from tests of six skid specimens conducted at higher speeds and bearing pressures than those of previous tests in the open literature. Skids constructed of tungsten with embedded carbide chips exhibited the lowest wear, whereas a skid constructed of Inconel 718 exhibited high wear rates. Friction coefficients for all the skid specimens were moderate and would provide adequate stopping performance on a long runway. Because of its low wear rate, a skid constructed of tungsten w [...] ...|$|R
