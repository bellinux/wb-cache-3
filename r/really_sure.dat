25|$|When he {{returned}} to England, Greig caused more controversy in the lead-up to the 1976 series against the West Indies. Appearing on television to discuss the coming summer, Greig's oratory created controversy when he expounded on West Indies players:I {{like to think that}} people are building these West Indians up, because I'm not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> they're as good as everyone thinks they are. I think people tend to forget it wasn't that long ago they were beaten 5–1 by the Australians and only just managed to keep their heads above water against the Indians {{just a short time ago}} as well. Sure, they've got a couple of fast bowlers, but really I don't think we're going to run into anything more sensational than Thomson and Lillee and so really I'm not all that worried about them. You must remember that the West Indians, these guys, if they get on top are magnificent cricketers. But if they're down, they grovel, and I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.|$|E

Mick Quinn tried to {{describe}} the concept: [...] "There's {{a few people who}} are just really out there. There's {{a lot of people around}} Oxford who are real spliffheads and that, who go and lie down in Port Meadow, but I'm not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> about them. I'm not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> that they're individuals: they're part of a much larger thing."

500|$|Krumwiede is {{an ardent}} {{conspiracy}} theorist who, according to Law, {{is the so-called}} index patient for [...] "what becomes a parallel epidemic of fear and panic". [...] "We definitely wanted {{him to have a}} messianic streak", said Soderbergh, whom Law talked to during the character's creating process. The two men discussed the appearances and the behaviors of a typical anti-government conspiracy theorist. Producer Gregory Jacobs commented that [...] "what's interesting is that you're not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> about him. Is the government really hiding something and does the herbal remedy he's talking about really work? I think we all suspect {{at one time or another}} that we're not getting the whole truth, and in that sense Krumwiede represents the audience's point of view." ...|$|E

[...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When I got down there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E

500|$|On Behind the Bin, a making-of {{documentary}} about Dustbin Baby, Wilson said that [...] "lots {{and lots of}} people will identify with" [...] the central theme of adoption, as at fourteen [...] "you start to look at your mum and dad and think 'I'm nothing like them', and everyone seems to have fantasies about that they were adopted or something, and so I think that it's a typical teenage thing that you question who you are". Richards says that she likes the idea that April [...] "went on a journey to try and find herself" [...] as [...] "a lot of people [...] try and do that {{because a lot of people}} get to the point where they're not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> who they are any more". Richards also discusses the motif of April's paper dolls, saying that April can relate to them as in different places, she is [...] "still the same person", but that she is [...] "coloured in differently by different people and different surroundings". Alexandra Hewett, who played the Young April, described the dolls as April's [...] "only real friends".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Rhimes said she tried {{to talk him out}} of quitting, explaining: [...] "I looked in his face and he was <b>really</b> <b>sure.</b> It felt like the right thing for him." [...] However, in another interview, Knight said of his exit: [...] "My five-year experience proved to me that I could not trust any answer that was given [...]" [...] Knight was [...] "at peace" [...] with his departure, saying: [...] "There just comes a time when it's so clear that moving on is the best decision." [...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know how good he has it.' There are a lot of people who would like to be in my position. But in the end, I need to be fulfilled in my work." ...|$|E
500|$|After a {{short period}} of inactivity, Dickinson once again teamed up with Roy Z and Tribe of Gypsies to record his next album, Accident of Birth; [...] "It was {{actually}} Roy that dragged me back into some assemblance, because he called up and he said, 'Listen, I've got some stuff and it's like a metal record.' And I wasn't thrilled, I wasn't <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> that I had anything to offer... Then he played me some backing-tracks he'd done for what was to become Accident of Birth down the phone and I thought 'There is something there.'" [...] Former Iron Maiden guitarist, Adrian Smith, was asked to guest on the record, but remained as a full-time member of Dickinson's solo outfit. The album marked a return to heavy metal for Dickinson, with Sputnikmusic remarking, [...] "The album's heavy feel is very satisfying, and definitely fills that void left by Maiden during the 90's." [...] The follow-up, The Chemical Wedding, was a semi-concept album on alchemy, which drew inspiration from William Blake's writings; with some songs, such as [...] "Book of Thel", having the same title as some of his poems, and the cover artwork featuring one of his paintings. The record was even more successful than its predecessor, with Sputnikmusic commenting, [...] "Bruce had shattered all expectations to create an album that might even be better than the previous one." [...] During The Chemical Weddings supporting tour, the live album, Scream for Me Brazil was recorded in São Paulo, after which Dickinson and Smith returned to Iron Maiden in February 1999.|$|E

500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have fun with it and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

[...] Commenting on the TTP militant outfit behind the bombing, Sanaullah added: [...] "We aren't <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> if it is a new group of terrorists. It is the same old organisation working now from Afghanistan, probably since the North and South Waziristans have already been cleared." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{first game}} in the stadium was against Ohio Wesleyan University on October 7, 1922, and brought a crowd of around 25,000, [...] which left people {{concerned}} because the stadium was half empty.

The crowd was announced at the game to be 72,000, {{but no one is}} <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> how many people made it into the stadium. This attendance mark was broken in a game against Michigan in 1926 when 90,411 came out to support the Buckeyes; this is also the last time standing-room-only tickets were sold for a game.|$|E
2500|$|There were {{numerous}} rumours circulating {{that the special}} would be Jenna Coleman's last on the show. Coleman and Steven Moffat remained quiet on the issue and insisted that people watch the episode to see whether she would be continuing into the ninth series. During the episode's climax, Clara decides to continue travelling with the Doctor, and Moffat revealed following the episode's airing that Coleman would appear {{in all of the}} ninth series. Coleman was apparently due to leave the show, but wasn't <b>really</b> <b>sure,</b> {{there was a lot of}} [...] "to-ing and fro-ing" [...] according to Moffat about whether she was going to leave, but ultimately she decided to stay.|$|E

2500|$|The secretive {{attitude}} and gradual unfolding of Snape's character was broadly admired, with Stephen Fry, the UK audio books narrator, saying in 2003: [...] "Most characters like Snape {{are hard to}} love {{but there is a}} sort of ambiguity—you can’t quite decide—something sad about him—lonely and it’s fascinating when you think he’s going to be the evil one..., then slowly you get this idea he’s not so bad after all." [...] David Yates, who directed the final four films of the series, also expressed his views on the character, saying: [...] "A character like Snape, where you're not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> if he's a good guy or a bad guy, that gives you a latent tension... I think the coolest thing you can do with an audience is deny them a little bit of information." [...] Despite being less than kind, the character quickly gained popularity within fandom to a level that surprised Rowling herself. Joyce Millman suggests in her essay [...] "To Sir with Love" [...] in the book Mapping the World of Harry Potter, that Snape is derived from a tradition of Byronic heroes such as Wuthering Heights Heathcliff.|$|E

But it's a lovely day – yellow roses, Karl doesn't sing – apart from the robbery, and the screaming and the ambulances. Neighbours eh? Brilliant. Nobody's done a wedding like this in years." [...] Kate Lucey from Sugar called [...] "Neighbours: The Explosion" [...] one of the serial's [...] "biggest storylines of the year" [...] and included it in her feature on upcoming dramatic soap storylines. Lucey said [...] "With an upcoming fire in the Rovers Return for Coronation Street, an explosion in Neighbours and the newly announced plans for a pregnancy in EastEnders, we're not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> where to look first."

2500|$|On June 2, 1976, {{the eve of}} {{the first}} test match of the series, England captain Tony Greig was {{interview}}ed on BBC’s midweek sports program Sportsnight. The interview was conducted on the roof of Hove’s Pavilion in Sussex. In the interview, Greig was forced to respond to questions concerning England’s chances of winning the series against the young West Indies' side. Greig described being unimpressed by the West Indian squad. He described the West Indies recent humiliating defeat in Australia and their tumultuous home series against India. Greig explained, [...] "I like to think that people are building these West Indians up, because I am not <b>really</b> <b>sure</b> they’re as good as everyone thinks they are.” He then notoriously claimed, “Sure, they’ve got a couple of fast bowlers, but… you must remember that (if) the West Indian get on top they are magnificent cricketers, but if they’re down, they grovel. And I intend, with the help of Closey and a few others, to make them grovel.” The insensitive comments only inflamed the racial and colonial implications surrounding the 1976 series. The remark was particularly provocative coming from Greig, the white South African captain of England.|$|E
