5|$|If the PCMR submits {{an adverse}} report, Parliament can either make {{amendments}} to the bill and <b>resubmit</b> it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all MPs.

5|$|The CLR {{bill was}} {{one of more than}} a dozen tube railway bills {{submitted}} to Parliament for the 1901 session, To review the bills on an equal basis, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor, but by the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to <b>resubmit</b> them for the following 1902 session. Among the committee's recommendations were the withdrawal of the CLR's City loop, and that a quick, tube route from Hammersmith to the City of London would benefit London's commuters.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas then made a written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally <b>resubmit</b> the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E

5|$|Rather than <b>resubmit</b> its 1901 bill, the CLR {{presented}} {{a much more}} ambitious alternative for the 1902 parliamentary session. The reversing loops were dropped, and the CLR instead proposed to turn the whole railway into a single large loop by constructing a new southern route between the two existing end points, adopting the committee's recommendation for a Hammersmith to City route. At the western end, new tunnels were to be extended from the dead-end reversing siding west of Shepherd's Bush station and from the depot access tunnel. The route was to pass under Shepherd's Bush Green and run under Goldhawk Road as far as Hammersmith Grove where it was to turn south. At {{the southern end of}} Hammersmith Grove a station was to be provided on the corner of Brook Green Road (now Shepherd's Bush Road) to provide an interchange with the three stations already located there.|$|E
5|$|The CCE's {{two bills}} were {{submitted}} to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for underground railways in the capital. As it had done in 1892, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor to review the bills. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over and the promoters of the bills were asked to <b>resubmit</b> them for the following 1902 session. Bills No. 1 and No. 2 were resubmitted in November 1901 together with a new bill – bill No. 3. The new bill modified the route of the proposed extension to Golders Green and added a short extension running beneath Charing Cross main line station to the Victoria Embankment where it would provide an interchange with the existing MDR station (then called Charing Cross).|$|E
5|$|Written by Robert Holmes and {{submitted}} to Story editor Donald Tosh on 25 April 1965. This four-part story idea involved the Doctor {{and his three}} companions arriving on an uninhabited planet to discover a space craft controlled by robots while its human occupants lie in suspended animation waiting for the additional crew members needed to once again operate their crashed ship. The Doctor and his companions are taken captive and trained up by the robots as the replacement crew members, however only three additional crew members are required, so the member of the Doctor's party that proves least useful is to be callously killed off by the human crew. This was Holmes first story submission for the series, and was primarily rejected due to the robots role being {{similar to that of}} the Mechanoids in The Chase from the previous season. Holmes would later <b>resubmit</b> this story idea to producer Peter Bryant on 20 May 1968 which led to the commissioning of what would become The Krotons.|$|E

25|$|Ellerbe {{announced}} on August 26 {{that he would}} <b>resubmit</b> his ambulance staffing plan to the D.C. City Council for approval. He pointed to 22 new paramedic hires and 20 new ambulances {{as a sign that}} the city would be able to provide good quality EMS care during night hours. Wells said the city council should be credited for pushing DCFEMS to improve vehicle purchasing and personnel hiring. But DCFES spokesman Keith St. Clair said the council's criticisms, rejections of Ellerbe's proposals, and publicity about DCFEMS problems had had no effect. St. Clair asserted that Ellerbe began making changes long before the council began its hearings.|$|E
25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon resubmission to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly <b>resubmit</b> a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel money away from purchasing additional coins.|$|E

25|$|Voinovich was {{considered}} shy and a rather low-key politician, a description he adopted himself. Once elected, {{he met with}} then Ohio Governor James Rhodes, to solicit the state government's help in clearing up the city's debts. Voinovich negotiated a debt repayment schedule and in October 1980, with the state serving as guarantor, eight local banks lent Cleveland $36.2 million, allowing the city to emerge from default. Despite this, the city's economy continued to decline and federal funding was cut. Two weeks earlier, voters turned down another 0.5 percent income tax increase. The opposition was led by Kucinich, who had been keeping a low profile since his defeat in the 1979 election. Voinovich said he would <b>resubmit</b> the tax issue on the February ballot to avoid facing a deficit in 1981. This time the voters approved the tax increase.|$|E
25|$|The special {{committee}} of the Japanese Lower House investigating the Fukushima disaster had requested to TEPCO to submit its procedural manuals for accidents {{by the end of}} the whole first week of September. But when the accident manuals were submitted to the Diet committee most of the contents was blacked out and heavily redacted. On 12 September 3 pages were presented, including a cover sheet, containing an index of actions to be taken in serious accidents. Most of the index was blacked out and TEPCO did collect the papers immediately after the meeting, explaining that this was restricted information with copyrights, that was not allowed to be made public. The {{special committee}} did ask the industry ministry to order the utility to <b>resubmit</b> the manuals in their original form, as required by law. NISA said it would consider what actions to take.|$|E

500|$|... "The Front" [...] is {{the nineteenth}} episode of The Simpsons fourth season. It {{originally}} aired in the United States on the Fox network on April 15, 1993. In the episode, Bart and Lisa decide {{to write an}} episode of The Itchy & Scratchy Show; after their script is rejected, they <b>resubmit</b> it {{under the name of}} their grandfather Abraham Simpson, resulting in Grampa being hired as a staff writer.

500|$|MacNeil {{submitted}} two {{designs for}} the obverse, the one which was successful and another, showing a standing Liberty facing right, which he would later <b>resubmit</b> in modified form in the Peace dollar design competition of 1921, again unsuccessfully. [...] In the rejected design, MacNeil's Liberty leans forward, an olive branch extended in her left hand, but her right hand holding the hilt of a broadsword. [...] According to Burdette, the design was intended {{to send a message}} to the belligerents in World War I that America wanted peace, but was ready to fight.|$|E
500|$|After being {{disappointed}} {{by a new}} episode of Itchy & Scratchy, Bart and Lisa decide that they can write a better one themselves. Inspired {{by the sight of}} Homer accidentally slicing Marge's hair off with hedge shears, they write a script titled [...] "Little Barbershop of Horrors", but their episode is rejected by Roger Meyers Jr., head of Itchy & Scratchy International. Correctly guessing that Meyers did not take them seriously because they were children, they <b>resubmit</b> the manuscript under Grampa's name, leading Meyers to hire Grampa as a staff writer. Bart and Lisa inform Grampa about what they did and the three of them conspire to continue passing off Bart and Lisa's scripts as Grampa's own, splitting the money three ways.|$|E

500|$|The opening [...] of the CLR on 30 July 1900 had stimulated {{interest}} in underground railways, and the B's bill was submitted to Parliament {{at the same}} time as a large number of other bills for tube lines in the capital. To review these bills, Parliament established a joint committee under Lord Windsor. Only the part of B's first extension as far as Museum Street was considered by the committee. The section to The Angel was held back, pending the findings of a separate committee which was investigating problems of vibration experienced on the CLR. The extension to Fulham was not discussed. By the time the committee had produced its report, the parliamentary session was almost over so the promoters of the bills were asked to <b>resubmit</b> them for the following 1902 session.|$|E
500|$|In {{the middle}} of the year Baird {{received}} five stories submitted by H. P. Lovecraft; Baird bought all five of them. [...] Lovecraft, who had been persuaded by friends to submit the stories, included a cover letter that was so remarkably negative {{about the quality of the}} manuscripts that Baird published it in the September 1923 issue, with a note appended saying that he had bought the stories [...] "despite the foregoing, or because of it". [...] However, Baird insisted that the stories be resubmitted as typed double-spaced manuscripts; Lovecraft disliked typing, and initially decided to <b>resubmit</b> only one story, [...] "Dagon". [...] It appeared in the October 1923 issue, which was the most noteworthy of Baird's tenure, since it included stories by three writers who would become frequent contributors to Weird Tales: as well as Lovecraft, it marked the first appearance in the magazine of Frank Owen and Seabury Quinn.|$|E
500|$|The Constitution also {{establishes}} a procedure for ensuring that statutes {{do not contain}} [...] "differentiating measures", that is, measures which discriminate against any racial or religious community. Most bills that have been passed by Parliament must be scrutinized by a non-elected advisory body called the Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR), which must report to the Speaker of Parliament if it is of the view that any clause in a bill contains a differentiating measure. If the PCMR submits an adverse report, Parliament can either make amendments to the bill and <b>resubmit</b> it to the Council for approval, or decide to present the bill for the President's assent nonetheless provided that a Parliamentary motion for such action has been passed by at least two-thirds of all Members of Parliament.
