Since traditional feature extraction methods are susceptible to the inevitable environmental noise, the type of vessels, and the speed of ships, the recognition accuracy will degrade significantly. Hence, we propose a robust time-frequency analysis method which combines resonance-based sparse signal decomposition (RSSD) and Hilbert marginal spectrum (HMS) analysis. First, the observed signals are decomposed into high <b>resonance</b> <b>component,</b> low <b>resonance</b> <b>component,</b> and residual component by RSSD, which is a nonlinear signal analysis method based not on frequency or scale but on resonance. High <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> is multiple simultaneous sustained oscillations, low <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> is nonoscillatory transients, and residual component is white Gaussian noises. According to the low-frequency periodic oscillatory characteristic of ship radiated noise, high <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> is the purified ship radiated noise. RSSD is suited to noise suppression for low-frequency oscillation signals. Second, HMS of high <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> is extracted by Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) as the feature vector.

We propose a nonlinear demodulation analysis method based on resonance {{and apply it to}} the fault diagnosis of rolling bearings. Unlike conventional demodulation methods that use frequency-based analysis and filtering techniques, our nonlinear demodulation analysis method is a decomposition demodulation of the signals according to different resonance based on Q-factors. When a local rolling bearing fault such as pitting is present, the fault vibration signals consist of the regular vibration signals and noise (a high <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> containing multiple simultaneous sustained oscillations) and a transient impulse signal (a low <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> being a signal containing nonoscillatory transients of faults). The regular vibration signal is a narrowband signal that has a high Q-factor, and the transient impulse signal is a wideband signal that has a low Q-factor. Using our resonance-based nonlinear demodulation analysis method, we decompose the signal into high resonance, low resonance, and residual components. Then, we perform a demodulation analysis on the low <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> that includes the fault information.

These interactions, which are also responsible for the relative weakness of the S–N bond in PhSNO and the modulation of −SNO group properties in substituted aromatic RSNOs, can be interpreted as a resonance stabilization of the ionic <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> RS–/NO+ of the RSNO electronic structure by the aromatic ring, similar to the resonance stabilization of PhS– anion.

Using the ENDF/B-VI evaluation for initial values, a new evaluation of the resonance parameters was performed by adding {{the results of the}} ORELA capture measurements to the experimental data base.

Although the resonance capture component of the present evaluation is 2 to 3 times smaller than that in ENDF/B-VI, the total capture cross section is much larger, at least in the energy range above 250 keV, because the direct capture component contributes values of the same order of magnitude as the <b>resonance</b> <b>component.</b> The direct component was not taken into account in the ENDF/B-VI evaluation and was calculated {{for the first time in}} the present evaluation...|$|E
40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the nature of}} bonding we derive the topological properties of the electron charge density {{of a variety of}} bonds based on ab initio valence bond methods. The electron density and its associated Laplacian arc partitioned into covalent, ionic, and resonance components in the valence bond spirit. The analysis provides a density-based signature of bonding types and reveals. along with the classical covalent and ionic bonds, the existence of two-electron bonds in which most of the bonding arises from the covalent-ionic resonance energy, so-called charge-shift bonds. As expected, the covalent component of the Laplacian at the bond critical point is found to be largely negative for classical covalent bonds. In contrast, for charge-shift bonds, the covalent part of the Laplacian is small or positive. in agreement with the weakly attractive or repulsive character of the covalent interaction in these bonds. On the other hand. the <b>resonance</b> <b>component</b> of file Laplacian is always negative or nearly zero, and it increases in absolute value with the charge-shift character of the bond, in agreement with the decrease of kinetic energy associated with covalent-ionic mixing.

Electron paramagnetic resonance measurements were made at similar to 20. 3 and 33 GHz for sample temperatures ranging from 77 to 100 K for most measurements. The components identified in the spectra, based on comparison with reported parameters, were, in the Si case, due to E' centers and peroxy radicals.

Specifically, to attenuate the spindle housing vibration using an active vibration control system to prevent the unbalance force from disturbing {{the rest of the}} machine systems e. g., the slide servo system or the machine metrology frame. The system controls three degrees of motion. An unbalanced spindle creates a rotating force vector with a once per revolution period.

The control algorithm of this system is fully implemented on a commercially available machine tool controller and is sensitive only to unbalance induced motion.

We generalize the definition and decomposition of R 1 (A, R) to arbitrary commutative rings, and point out the anomalies that arise. In general the decomposition is parametrized by neighborly graphs, which need not induce neighborly partitions of subarrangements of A. We use this approach to show that the resonance variety of the Hessian arrangement over a field of characteristic three has a nonlinear component, a cubic threefold with interesting line structure. This answers a question of A. Suciu. We show that Suciu’s deleted B 3 arrangement has <b>resonance</b> <b>components</b> over Z 2 that intersect nontrivially. We also exhibit resonant weights over Z 4 supported on the deleted B 3, which has no neighborly partitions. The modular resonant weights on the deleted B 3 exponentiate to points on the complex torus which lie on, and determine, the translated 1 -torus in the first characteristic variety. 1. Resonance and characteristic varieties Arising out of the study of local system cohomology and fundamental groups, characteristic and resonance varieties of complex hyperplane arrangements have become the object of much of the current research in the field. The study of resonance varieties in particular has led to surprising connections with other areas of mathematics: Kac-Moody algebras, Latin squares and loops, nets, special pencils of plane curves, homological algebra, sl 2 representations, critical points, and Fuchsia...|$|R
40|$|Despite a {{few decades}} of intense study, a full {{description}} of tautomers of one-electron-oxidized guanine remains to be achieved. Here we show that two of these tautomers are produced by the protonation of an 8 -haloguanine electron adduct. The rate constants for the reactions of hydrated electrons (e_(aq) -) {{with a variety of}} 8 -substituted guanine derivatives have been measured by a pulse radiolysis technique and correlated with both inductive and <b>resonance</b> <b>components</b> of the substituents. The fate of electron adducts was investigated by radiolytic methods coupled with product studies and addressed computationally by means of time-dependent DFT (TD-B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 G**//B 1 B 95 / 6 - 31 +G**) calculations. The reaction of eaq- with 8 -haloguanosine or 8 -halo- 2 ‘-deoxyguanosine produces the first observable transient species that decay unimolecularly (k = 1 × 10 ^ 5 s^(- 1) at 22 °C) to give the one-electron oxidized guanosine or 2 ‘-deoxyguanosine. Theory suggests that the electron adducts of 8 -bromoguanine derivatives protonated at C 8 form a π-complex, with the Br atom situated above the molecular plane, that is prompt to eject Br-. The two short-lived intermediates, which show a substantial difference in their absorption spectra, are recognized to be the two purine tautomers (i. e., iminic 7 and aminic 3 forms). The spin density distributions of the two tautomers are quite different at the O 6 and N 10 positions, whereas they are very similar at the N 3, C 5, and C 8 positions. The resonance structures of the two tautomers are discussed in some detail. B 1 B 95 / 6 - 31 +G** calculations show also that the tautomerization from the iminic (7) to the aminic (3) arrangement is a water-assisted process...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a {{detailed}} study of longitudinal strength in the nucleon resonance region, presenting new results from inclusive electron-proton cross sections measured at Jefferson Lab Hall C in the four-momentum transfer range 0. 2 < Q^ 2 < 5. 5 GeV^ 2. The data {{have been used to}} accurately perform 167 Rosenbluth-type longitudinal / transverse separations. The precision R = sigma_L / sigma_T data are presented here, along with the first separate values of the inelastic structure functions F_ 1 and F_L in this regime. The <b>resonance</b> longitudinal <b>component</b> is found to be significant, both in magnitude and in the existence of defined mass peaks. Additionally, quark-hadron duality is here observed above Q^ 2 = 1 GeV^ 2 in the separated structure functions independently. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
