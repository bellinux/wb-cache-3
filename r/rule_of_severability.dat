40|$|When a court holds a {{provision}} of a statute unconstitutional, a question remains regarding {{the validity of}} the remainder of the statute. The court may find that the unconstitutional provision may be severed from the statute and leave the remainder of the statute in effect. Alternatively, the court may hold that the unconstitutional provision cannot be severed and invalidate the entire statute. This article argues that the jurisprudence surrounding the issue <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> is confusing and inconsistent. After explaining the concept <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> and its ramifications for statutes, I trace the development of the current judicial test for determining when a statute should be found severable. I then discuss the effect <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> clauses - statutory provisions directing courts to leave the remainder of the statute in effect in the event {{a provision}} is found unconstitutional, concluding that such clauses do not necessarily cause a court to reach a particular result. Next, I examine the question of legislative intent in the context <b>of</b> <b>severability,</b> concluding that courts have departed from established methods of determining legislative intent, opting instead to attempt to answer the hypothetical question whether the legislature would have chosen to enact the remaining parts of the statute without the unconstitutional provision. Because the current jurisprudence <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> is unsettled, this article asserts that courts should follow several general principles regarding severability. First, courts should apply a plain meaning rule to severability clauses, so that a statute containing such a clause will automatically be considered severable. Second, when a statute does not contain a severability clause, the courts should look to the history, purpose, and structure of the statute to ascertain legislative intent. Finally, to assist in this inquiry, I advocate the creation of a legislatively-enacted clear statement rule requiring that courts consider a statute severable when a statute is silent on the issue <b>of</b> <b>severability...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Article 4 {{implies that}} the High Court may void a piece of {{legislation}} to the extent of its inconsistency with the Constitution. At present, it is unclear how the Court will apply this requirement. If, say, an entire piece of criminal legislation or one of its provisions is found to be void, a person alleged to have committed an offence created by the impugned legislation may be able to escape liability. To circumvent this, a test <b>of</b> <b>severability,</b> also known as the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test, has been established in the UK. If the unconstitutional parts of the legislation are severable from the constitutional parts, the latter are preserved and remain valid and enforceable. In Director of Public Prosecutions v. Hutchinson (1988), the House of Lords held that two forms <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> must be established for a law to be held partially valid– textual severability and substantial severability. A provision is textually severable if it remains grammatical and correct after severance. It is substantially severable if its substance after severance remains true to its [...] "legislative purpose, operation and effect". However, the court also recognized that a rigid adherence to the test <b>of</b> textual <b>severability</b> may result in unreasonable consequences. It may defeat legislation with a substantial purpose clearly within the lawmaker's power but, by oversight, which was written in a way that exceeded that scope of power. Hence, the [...] "blue pencil" [...] test may still apply to rescue a provision that is not textually severable {{as long as it does}} not alter the substantial purpose and effect of the impugned provision.|$|R

40|$|Established {{doctrine}} on the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> unconstitutional {{statutory provisions}} has drawn criticism {{on almost every}} conceivable basis. Commentators have condemned severability doctrine as too malleable and as too rigid; as encouraging judicial overreaching and as encouraging judicial abdication. They have criticized the doctrine 2 ̆ 7 s reliance on legislative intent and its disregard of legislative intent; its excessive attention to political concerns and its inattention to political concerns; its lack of any coherent explanation. The reasons for this lingering controversy are easy to discern. One is purely pragmatic. 2 ̆ 2 We live {{in an age of}} statutes. 2 ̆ 2 Legislation provides our primary source of law in the late twentieth century, and legislation of a certain type: lengthy, reticulated statutes comprising several titles addressing numerous, sometimes unrelated, subjects. Questions <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> inhere in such legislation. A more profound explanation lies in severability doctrine itself. Since the mid-nineteenth century, when they began to address the question seriously, courts have analyzed the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions under a contracts approach. That is, in determining the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> unconstitutional statutory provisions, courts have applied essentially the same test they employ to determine the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> illegal contract terms. A statute is viewed for these purposes as a 2 ̆ 2 bargain 2 ̆ 2 among the legislators who enact it; in deciding whether a given statutory provision is severable, a court will look to that provision 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 importance 2 ̆ 2 in that 2 ̆ 2 bargain. 2 ̆ 2 Just as in contracts law, the writing will not necessarily dispose of the question. Because severability turns on the intent of the legislators, a court may examine the statute 2 ̆ 7 s legislative history for indications of what the legislators would have wanted. While it may create a 2 ̆ 2 presumption 2 ̆ 2 in favor <b>of</b> <b>severability,</b> even an express severability clause cannot overcome 2 ̆ 2 strong 2 ̆ 2 indications in the legislative history that the legislators in fact 2 ̆ 2 intended otherwise. 2 ̆ 2 The contracts approach makes less sense with respect to statutes. A statute is not a private ordering that affects only the legislators who enact it. Rather, a statute is a 2 ̆ 2 political document 2 ̆ 2 that binds persons outside the legislative branch. Those persons have only limited access to the statute 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 negotiations. 2 ̆ 2 In order to conform their conduct to the requirements of law, they must rely on the text of the statute itself. Moreover, unlike a contract, a statute does not exist apart from its written text. The statute is the written text: the intent of the legislators has no independent authority. Finally, it is much more difficult to determine the intent of the legislators who pass a statute than it is to determine the intent of the parties to a traditional bipolar contract. In resolving questions about the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions, courts should forgo the contracts approach in favor of a textual approach. Under such an approach, the text of the statute would be dispositive. Where the text addressed severability, either directly or indirectly, a court would enforce the statute 2 ̆ 7 s commands; a court would not, as under the contracts approach, look to legislative history to overcome the plain meaning of statutory language in this regard. Where the statute remained silent on the question, the court would, as a matter of default, sever the unconstitutional provision and enforce the remainder of the statute. Part II of this Article describes the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> illegal contract terms and demonstrates how the focus on the parties 2 ̆ 7 shared intent comports with a proper understanding of contracts. Part III discusses the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions and shows why the contracts approach makes much less sense with respect to statutes. Part IV sets forth a textual approach to the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> statutory provisions. Finally, this Article concludes in Part V with some observations about the utility of further comparative study of contractual and statutory interpretation...|$|R

2500|$|But Stevens's {{principal}} objection {{was that}} the Court had crafted a new kind <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> analysis. [...] He started with the premise that all legislative enactments are presumed to be valid, and may only be struck down in their entirety if the law is unconstitutional in [...] "all or nearly all of its applications," [...] or if the invalid provision cannot be severed from {{the remainder of the}} statute. [...] Neither of those conditions applied to the federal sentencing laws, Stevens observed, and so {{there was no need to}} adopt a third method of curing constitutional violations. [...] After all, according to the Sentencing Commission, 45% of criminal sentences involve no enhancements whatsoever, and not all of the rest would actually implicate a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. [...] Furthermore, defendants may waive their jury-trial rights, and so it follows that they may also waive their Blakely rights in appropriate situations.|$|R
50|$|Other {{commentators}} {{noted that}} if “severability” {{were to be}} considered a touchstone for the definition of income, it followed that a number of sales or exchanges of property that did not involve immediate realization through severance would not be taxable. Realizing that the “one size fits all” definition of income in Eisner v. Macomber was too broad, the U.S. Supreme Court reconsidered the idea <b>of</b> <b>severability</b> in Helvering v. Bruun. In this case, the Court addressed {{the question of whether or}} not a lessor recognizes income from the receipt of a leasehold improvement made by a lessee during the lease when the improvement reverts to the lessor at the end of the lease. In ruling that the value of the improvement was taxable, the Court noted that not every gain need be realized in cash to be taxable. There was a clear increase in the taxpayer’s wealth, and this increase did not have to be severed to recognize such increase as income for federal income tax purposes.|$|R

40|$|When the Court {{considered}} Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) in United States v.

40|$|As {{the face}} of {{commerce}} changes, the law usually follows, albeit at some distance. The United States Supreme Court has recently sped the pace.

50|$|As to the {{question}} <b>of</b> the <b>severability</b> <b>of</b> the provisions inconsistent with the Constitution from the remaining provisions of sections 65A to 65M, Kriegler J held (Chaskalson P, Mahomed DP, Ackermann J, Didcott J, Kentridge AJ, Langa J, Madala J, Mokgoro J, O'Regan J and Sachs J concurring) {{that it was impossible}} to excise only those provisions which failed to distinguish between the two categories of debtors. The reason was that, in order to achieve this, the court would have to engage in the details of law-making, which was a constitutional activity given to the legislatures. It was, however, possible to sever the provisions which made up the option of imprisonment. In so severing such provisions, the court would nevertheless leave intact the object of the statute: to provide a system to assist in the collection of judgment debts. The removal of one of the options available under the system did not render the system contrary to the purpose of the legislative scheme. The infringing provisions could accordingly be severed, and the balance of the system usefully remain in force.|$|R
