40|$|Binding assays still form a {{fundamental}} part of modem drug development. <b>Receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assays</b> are mostly based on radioactivity {{because of their}} speed, ease of use and reproducibility. Disadvantages, such as health hazards and production of radioactive waste, have prompted the development of non-radioactive <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assays.</b> This application therefore focuses on measuring receptor-ligand interactions using mass spectrometry. Moreover, the novelty of this approach originates in determining multiple analytes in a single assay (multiplexing). The proof of principle of a non-radioactive multiplex receptor assay is demonstrated using a pool of receptors from rat cortical tissue with flunitrazepam, MADAM and pindolol in one vial with or without their respective displacers. Flunitrazepam, MADAM and pindolol bound specifically at 73 %, 30 % and 40 % to their respective receptors. This corresponds to specific binding sites of 0. 61 pmol/mg protein, 0. 07 pmol/mg protein and 0. 06 pmol/mg protein, respectively. We propose to measure the bound fraction instead of the free fraction {{in order to reach}} a significant difference in measured signals (total binding versus non-specific binding). The bound fraction can be obtained after dissociating the ligand from the receptor-ligand complex using 50 % methanol in water. The current setup of the assay calls for further improvement with respect to the measurement of binding constants for a multitude of receptors in one assay with sufficient accuracy and precision.

These results are supported by Fail et al.

In addition, the Japan Environment Agency referred to their studies (9) and removed the styrene dimers and trimers from their list of endocrine disruptors (9). However, Ohyama et al.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which bacterial heat-stable enterotoxins (ST I STA) cause diarrhea in humans and animals {{has been linked to}} the activation of an intestinal membrane-bound guanylate cyclase. Guanylin, a recently discovered rat intestinal peptide, is homologous in structure to ST I and can activate guanylate cyclase present on the human colonic carcinoma cell line T 84. To directly test the mechanistic association of guanylate cyclase activation with diarrhea, we synthesized guanylin and a guanylin analog termed N 9 P 10 guanylin and compared their biological activities with those of a synthetic ST I analog, termed ST Ib(6 - 18). We report that guanylin is able to inhibit the binding of a radiolabeled ST I analog to rat intestinal cells but causes diarrhea in infant mice only at doses at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than that of ST Ib(6 - 18). In contrast, N 9 P 10 guanylin was enterotoxic in mice at much lower doses than guanylin but proved to be a weaker inhibitor of radiolabeled ST I than guanylin in the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assay.</b> The pattern of guanylate cyclase activation observed for ST Ib(6 - 18) and the two guanylin analogs parallels the results observed in the <b>receptor</b> <b>binding</b> <b>assay</b> rather than those observed in the diarrheal assay.
