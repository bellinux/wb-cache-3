5|$|An {{area the}} Reform Act {{did not address}} was the issue of {{municipal}} and <b>regional</b> <b>government.</b> As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries {{in the late nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, the {{population}} of the Tryon Creek watershed within Portland was about 18,000. In 2005, Portland's Bureau of Environmental Services (BES) described land-use zoning in the watershed as follows: single-family residential, 55percent; parks and open space, 14percent; multi-family residential, 5percent; commercial, 3percent, and insufficient data, 2percent. To reach 100percent, BES listed but did not differentiate by zoning type the roughly 20percent of the watershed that lies beyond the Portland city limits. Metro, the <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> for the Portland metropolitan area, says that parks and natural areas cover about 21percent of the total watershed, while single-family housing dominates most of the rest.|$|E

5|$|Caltrans {{engineer}} Jacob Dekema {{announced in}} April1969 that construction on SR76 {{and the nearby}} SR 78 between I-5 and US395 would be delayed until work was underway on I-5 and US395 was underway, or at least until 1976. Nevertheless, a widening project was commissioned in 1970 between Pauma Reservation Road and Cole Grade Road, well east of US395. The next year, construction began on a new interchange between the future routing of SR76 and I-5, near Oceanside Harbor and Camp Del Mar in Camp Pendleton. The expansion of SR76 appeared on the Comprehensive Planning Organization (CPO) <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> plan in late 1974. At that time, there was an effort by the City of Oceanside to have SR76 included as a scenic highway, but SR76 has not {{been included in the}} system. The Chamber of Commerce decided to continue efforts to have SR76 expanded at the end of 1974.|$|E
5|$|Henry Clifford lived until 1523. Under {{him and his}} son– {{also called}} Henry, who later became Earl of Cumberland– the castle was {{intermittently}} in use as a residence for the family. After Brough Castle was destroyed in a fire in 1521 {{it is likely that}} Brougham became the new administrative centre and focus of the local lordship. As Earl of Cumberland Henry controlled Penrith and Carlisle, although he was an unpopular landlord. When the north of England rose up in the Pilgrimage of Grace in 1536, Henry was one of those targeted by the rebels. He confronted the rebel leaders at Kirkby Stephen in February 1537, and after his defeat he retreated to Brougham Castle. After the Pilgrimage of Grace was suppressed, there were reforms of <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> in the north west. One of the results was that the title of Earl of Cumberland no longer gave Clifford wardenship of Penrith and Carlisle, with Brougham Castle once again becoming the Cliffords' northern-most castle.|$|E

In hierarchical structures, federal and <b>regional</b> <b>governments</b> make sequential policy choices. Sequential choices may feature centralized or decentralized leadership.

5|$|The subdivisions of England {{consist of}} up to four levels of {{subnational}} division controlled {{through a variety of}} types of administrative entities created for the purposes of local government. The highest tier of local government were the nine regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, South East, South West, and London. These were created in 1994 as Government Offices, used by the UK government to deliver a wide range of policies and programmes regionally, but there are no elected bodies at this level, except in London, and in 2011 the <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> offices were abolished. The same boundaries remain in use for electing Members of the European Parliament on a regional basis.|$|E
5|$|There is epigraphic {{evidence}} from the Hellenistic period and Antigonid dynasty that that the Macedonian kingdom relied on various regional officials to conduct affairs of state. This included a number of high-ranking municipal officials, including the military-rooted strategos and politarch, i.e. the elected governor (archon) of a large city (polis), but also the politico-religious office of the epistates. Although these were highly influential members of local and <b>regional</b> <b>government,</b> Carol J. King asserts {{that they were not}} collectively powerful enough to formally challenge the authority of the Macedonian king or his right to rule. Robert Malcolm Errington affirms that no evidence exists about the personal backgrounds of these officials, although they may have been picked from the available aristocratic pools of philoi and hetairoi that were used to fill vacancies of officers in the army.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, Internet and {{international}} telephone service in Ürümqi remained limited {{for nearly a}} year after the riots. As late as November, most of the Internet was still inaccessible to residents and international phone calls were impossible; as late as December, most web content hosted outside the autonomous region remained off-limits to all but a few journalists, and residents had to travel to Dunhuang 14 hours away to access the Internet normally. Within the city, only about 100 local sites, such as banks and <b>regional</b> <b>government</b> websites, could be accessed. Both incoming and outgoing international phone calls were disallowed, so Ürümqi residents could only communicate by calling intermediaries in other cities in China who would then place the international calls. The communications blackout generated controversy even within China: Yu Xiaofeng of Zhejiang University criticised the move, and many Ürümqi locals said it hurt businesses and delayed recovery, whereas David Gosset of the Euro-China forum argued that the government had the right to shut down communications for the sake of social stability; some locals believed that getting away from the Internet even improved their quality of life.|$|E
