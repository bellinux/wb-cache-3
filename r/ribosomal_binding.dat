50|$|Pseudouridine, or Ψ, {{the overall}} most {{abundant}} post-translational RNA modification, is created when a uridine base is isomerised.

It is incorporated into stable non-coding RNAs such as tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA, with roles in <b>ribosomal</b> ligand <b>binding</b> and translational fidelity in tRNA, and in fine-tuning branching events and splicing events in snRNAs. Pseudouridine has one more hydrogen bond donor from an imino group and a more stable C-C bond, since a C-glycosidic linkage has replaced the N-glycosidic linkage found in its counterpart (regular uridine). As neither of these changes affect its base-pairing properties, both will have the same output when directly sequenced; therefore methods for its detection involve prior biochemical modification.|$|R
