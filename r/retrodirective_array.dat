40|$|A <b>Retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> has {{the unique}} {{property}} in {{that when it}} is interrogated, the array automatically points its beam toward the interrogator. Unlike more complicated arrays that require digital signal processing, the <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> achieves self-steering through simple analog circuits. As a result, retrodirective arrays are the preferred solution for applications requiring self-steering where the limiting factors are cost and design complexity. This thesis presents several advances in wireless communications systems {{through the use of}} retrodirective arrays. First, a phase-conjugating <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> is used to improve the reliability of a radio link in a severe multipath environment. The method showed up to 31 dB of improvement of a 5. 35 -GHz communication system when compared to a conventional array. Next, for terrestrial-to-space or space-to-space applications, a two-dimensional <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> is presented at 3. 84 GHz. The complexity of a complicated LO feed network is eliminated by basing the design on self-oscillating mixers. Finally, a <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> is specifically designed for a 10. 5 -GHz small-satellite network. A network of small satellites promise increased mission flexibility and success by distributing the tasks of a single large satellite. Quadruple subharmonic mixing is used as well as two-dimensional retrodirectivity and circular polarization to accommodate for the power constraints and lack of attitude control of small satellites...|$|E

A proper {{characterization of}} the transistor nonlinear behavior revealed the existence of two biasing regions where the desired output signal, the second harmonic or the IF component, can be generated with maximum conversion gain and phase opposition. This attractive issue has been taken advantage of, to BPSK modulate the response in two approaches: in a frequency doubling active antenna and in a phase conjugating circuit for <b>retrodirective</b> <b>arrays.</b> Aperture coupled patch radiators were designed, to integrate these modulators in low cost, compact and high performance transponders...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, highly {{efficient}} and linear wireless transmitting architectures are extended to <b>retrodirective</b> <b>arrays</b> (RDAs) for assuring full-duplex communications using spectrally efficient digital modulation formats. Dynamic biasing a single FET resistive mixer topology, or pumping {{two of them}} with properly outphased local oscillator excitations, the amplitude and phase components of the signal to be retransmitted may be recombined over an arriving interrogation with a different modulation format. Two 4 x 1 RDAs have been implemented, designed over dual-gate FET (DGFET) or Enhancement-mode PHEMT (EPHEMT) devices.

Then a suitable structure for further design is determined and particular blocks of complete <b>retrodirective</b> antenna <b>array</b> are briefly described and their measured parameters are presented. Relatively high frequency offset between received and transmitted wave makes it possible to use frequency filters for received and transmitted signal separation which led to significant reduction of the circuit complexity...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to provide novel {{solutions}} for robust radio communication for longer range microwave RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), systems {{through the use of}} retrodirective arrays (RDA). The <b>retrodirective</b> <b>Array</b> is a self-steering antenna array which automatically transmits a radio signal back in the direction of signal arrival without the requirement of complex signal processing. Analogue implementation of retrodirective arrays allows real time, multi functional and signal tracking operations at low physical complexity and power consumption. To date the majority of the research undertaken on <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> technology, focuses heavily on passive implementation such as transponder and retroreflector for radar application. The work presented in this thesis places largely emphasis on the integration of active <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> as a basestation technology in RFID situations, where high quality performance and multifunctional operations are required. The systems presented in this thesis exploit various features of <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> such as automatic beam forming, multipath signal recombination and multiple beams forming. Theoretical analysis of retrodirective arrays and implementation techniques for various applications are discussed. By deploying different <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> architecture such as Van Atta and phase conjugating at the RFID interrogator and transponder, the self-steering action of retrodirective anays is shown to relax antenna alignment requirements and lead through to range extension for RFID systems. The retrodirective signal recombination/focusing effect in multipath rich environments improves signal strength at the target position. Therefore, instead of transmitting a high EIRP line-of-sight signal to the interrogator, the same power density can occur by utilizing the presence of multipath.

The <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> {{antenna system}} is {{operated}} faster than existing techniques of beamforming {{due to its}} less complexity. Therefore, it is effective for beam tracking in the environment of fast vehicle. On the other hand, it also has difficulty in estimating AOA according to multipath environment or multiuser signals.

40|$|Abstract—A one-dimensional, dual frequency, active <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> is {{proposed}} for {{wireless power transfer}} applications. Microstrip circular patch antennas with four shorting pins are used as array elements to suppress surface waves.

The proposed <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> operates at 2. 4 GHz for the interrogating signal and 5. 8 GHz for the retransmitted signal, using up-converting mixers. The beam scanning inherent in retrodirective arrays ensures a constant power level available to the charging devices, regardless of their location within an angular sector over which retrodirectivity is achieved.

40|$|A {{quadrature}} {{phase shift}} keying (QPSK) <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array</b> phase modulator (RAPM) was designed and fabricated to characterize its backscatter signal constellation when placed near objects with varying conductivities and relative permittivities. The signal constellations produced when the RAPM was placed near objects were compared to a constellation in free space to determine relative magnitude and phase changes. When conductors and high permittivity dielectrics were placed close behind the RAPM, constellation points were found to shrink in magnitude by up to twenty percent and shift in phase by up to eight degrees. When conductors were placed between the RAPM and an interrogator, the signal constellation was found to collapse, shrinking by up to 95. 6 percent. For materials similar to free space, minimal constellation shrinkage resulted, but signal constellation rotation by up to 68 degrees occurred. The power consumption of a RAPM was also characterized and found to decrease as the number of bits per symbol increased. This result demonstrates that in comparison to conventional backscatter tags, which implement one bit per symbol, the RAPM can implement a greater number of bits per symbol, reduce its power consumption, and increase its range in a passive backscatter communication system. To characterize the beamwidth of the RAPM's <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array,</b> a radar cross section (RCS) measurement of the RAPM was performed over a scan angle range of - 90 to + 90 degrees. The structural component generated by the RAPM's patch antenna ground plane was found to dominate the antenna mode of the <b>retrodirective</b> <b>array.</b> As a result, a novel homodyne receiver based RCS measurement was performed to filter out the structural RCS component and measure the pure antenna mode of the RAPM.
