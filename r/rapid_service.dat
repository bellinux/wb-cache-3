25|$|On July 5, 2005, VTA {{implemented}} {{its first}} rapid bus line along the VTA's busiest corridor. Modeled after the Metro <b>Rapid</b> <b>service</b> in Los Angeles, rapid bus Line 522 follows {{most of the}} Line 22 route, and features limited stops, headway based schedules, low floor fleet, and signal priority along El Camino Real. However, the current rapid bus service by VTA does not fully qualify as BRT, {{due to the lack}} of separate ticketing stations and platforms, distinctive vehicles, and special lanes (which make BRT mimic more of a light rail or tram route, instead of a bus route). Rather, it serves as a temporary rapid bus service until VTA officially opens a BRT transit corridor along the same route, which will upgrade the current 522 route.|$|E
25|$|Within the neighborhood, AC Transit's 26 line carries {{passengers}} {{to and from}} the neighborhood along 14th Street, routing directly to nearby BART stations. AC Transit's Uptown Regional Transit Center bus mall on nearby Thomas L. Berkeley Way (20th Street) is now in full farebox service, and features multiple bus shelters with seating, NextBus arrival prediction signs, local and Rapid Bus service to Oakland's streetcar suburbs. These stations host local service, <b>Rapid</b> <b>service,</b> Transbay Express, and All Nighter service. A Translink Add Value Machine is located at AC Transit Headquarters on Franklin Street. The number 1 line running along the neighborhood on 12th Street, between San Leandro and Berkeley, is years into the planning process for the implementation of a full scale bus rapid transit line. The most substantial planning alternative proposed for this system would feature double-articulated buses with five to six doors at boarding platform level, a separated bus-only lane, center median platforms with proof-of-payment ticket machines to speed boarding, and signalization priority to allow bus drivers to change traffic lights in their favor.|$|E
25|$|Metro Local buses {{are painted}} orange ("California Poppy"), Metro Rapid buses are painted red, and Metro Silver Line buses are painted silver. Metro Local buses {{acquired}} {{prior to the}} adoption of these colors in 2004 are white with a gold stripe around the bus; these buses been painted orange during their mid-life rehabilitation (except for the 5300-series New Flyer buses assigned to Metro Rapid lines, which were repainted in red livery in 2004-05). The 7000- and 7600-series buses acquired for Metro <b>Rapid</b> <b>service</b> in 2000 and 2002 are red with a white stripe along the top (7102-7112, 7617-7618, 7628, 7643, 7646 were white with a red Metro Rapid logo on all sides and some of these buses have been repainted to standard red and white and a few have been converted to Metro Local service), but some have been repainted to the current red and silver livery. Most had been repainted beginning in 2007; some have been repainted either in the updated Metro Rapid scheme or in Metro Local colors.|$|E

500|$|Douglas Aircraft {{had been}} {{selected}} to build the missiles for Zeus, known under the company designation DM-15. This was essentially a scaled-up Hercules with an improved, more powerful single piece booster replacing Hercules' cluster of four smaller boosters. Intercepts could {{take place at the}} limits of the Wilson requirements, at ranges and altitudes of about [...] Prototype launches were planned for 1959. For more <b>rapid</b> <b>service</b> entry there had been some consideration given to an interim system based on the original Hercules missile, but these efforts were dropped. Likewise, early requirements for a secondary anti-aircraft role were also eventually dropped.|$|E
2500|$|The MTA's express routes {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the [...] "express" [...] trips assigned to several of the local bus routes. Express routes are dedicated to providing <b>rapid</b> <b>service</b> by limiting the number of stops along the route. [...] The number of express routes has declined over the past two decades as new rapid transit services have been constructed, and poor-performing routes were eliminated or consolidated.|$|E
2500|$|Ingram soon {{realized}} that the word burger evoked connotations of circus performances at livestock markets and greasy pieces of meat eaten in the poorest districts {{of the city in}} the collective mind of the American public. He tried to change those connotations from White Castle's earliest days. At the same time, he became known to some as the Henry Ford of the hamburger, while inventing a restaurant concept he called the [...] "White Castle System", which helped the hamburger achieve fame. Between 1923 and 1931, the [...] "White Castle System" [...] established almost a hundred restaurants in cities throughout the Midwestern United States. In order to raise awareness among White Castle employees, a newsletter entitled [...] "The hot hamburger" [...] was circulated throughout the company, which challenged the employees to improve the sale of the burgers with a simple idea: to be able to prepare burgers rapidly so anyone could purchase and eat them anytime and anywhere. Instead of waiting for half an hour to be served at a traditional restaurant, the White Castle System provided <b>rapid</b> <b>service</b> and a menu centered around the hamburger. At the time, the hamburger was typically served with coffee. Upton Sinclair's The Jungle had already caused public outrage over the safety of processed meat, so by the 1920s, the general public had come to expect a clean and hygienic hamburger. In addition to offering clean and safe food, White Castle offered regularity and standardization, ensuring that each patty was served in the same manner in each restaurant. At the time, this was an entirely novel idea that would revolutionize the sale of food itself with a style that would {{come to be known as}} fast food. During its early years, White Castle emphasized providing quality coffee, and collaborated with universities to publish studies on the nutritional quality of their hamburgers.|$|E
