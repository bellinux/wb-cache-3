5|$|When both UIRP (particularly in its {{approximation}} form) and {{purchasing power}} parity (PPP) hold, the two parity conditions together reveal a relationship among expected real interest rates, wherein changes in expected real interest rates reflect expected {{changes in the}} real exchange rate. This condition is known as <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity (RIRP) and {{is related to the}} international Fisher effect. The following equations demonstrate how to derive the RIRP equation.|$|E
5|$|Economists {{have found}} {{empirical}} evidence that covered interest rate parity generally holds, though not with precision {{due to the}} effects of various risks, costs, taxation, and ultimate differences in liquidity. When both covered and uncovered interest rate parity hold, they expose a relationship suggesting that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. This relationship can be employed to test whether uncovered interest rate parity holds, for which economists have found mixed results. When uncovered interest rate parity and purchasing power parity hold together, they illuminate a relationship named <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity, which suggests that expected real interest rates represent expected adjustments in the real exchange rate. This relationship generally holds strongly over longer terms and among emerging market countries.|$|E

A dynamic factor model is estimated in which <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are influenced by <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> and inflation factors that are common to all the countries, and by country- specific factors.

They developed a dynamic insurance contract model with an incomplete market monetary economy and demonstrated that the optimal inflation rate is positive. This paper investigates {{the relationship between}} <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and welfare in their model with more precise measures of inflation around the optimal inflation rate.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the mean-reversion property of <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Many past {{studies have reported}} puzzling outcomes of the mean-aversion of <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{for a number of}} countries. In the article, we employ panel unit root tests and carry out half-life estimation based on the bias-corrected bootstrap. These findings of the paper provide strong evidence that, in both major Western and East Asian capital markets (including several emerging ones), <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are mean-reverting. In addition, we find evidence that the degree of mean-reversion of the <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> is positively correlated with that of output growth, which is consistent with the implications of standard intertemporal behavior.

25|$|According to {{the theory}} of {{rational}} expectations, borrowers and lenders form an expectation of inflation in the future.

25|$|Therefore, to {{evaluate}} the real worthiness of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound {{the amount of money}} at a given interest rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds the minimum guaranteed rate provided the bank's saving account, for example. If one wants to compare their change in purchasing power, then they should use the <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the reasons for}} the dramatic increase in <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the world economy observed over the 1978 to 1984 period. The authors find little evidence to suggest that budget deficits can be blamed for the increase in worlwide <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The structural inflation-adjusted budget deficits of the major OECD nations has not changed appreciably since 1978. Rather, the authors are led to explain high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in terms of the combined effect of tigh monetary policies and the increased attractiveness of investment. The importance of the later factor is evidenced by the strong performance of stock markets and investment around the world in the face of high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The paper finds {{significant}} deviations between short-term {{emerging market}} <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and world <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{primarily due to}} the inflationary expectations of the local investor base. We test for long-run <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> convergence in emerging markets using a time varying panel unit root test proposed by Pesaran to capture the improved macro-economic fundamentals since early 1990 s. We also estimate the speed of convergence {{in the presence of}} a shock. The paper suggests that <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the emerging markets show some convergence in the long run but <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> parity does not hold. Our results also find that the speed of adjustment of real rates to a shock is estimated to differ significantly across the emerging markets. Measured by their half-life, some emerging markets in Asia, E. Europe and S. Africa, where <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are generally low, take much longer to adjust than where <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are generally high (Latin America, Turkey). From a policy perspective, encouraging foreign investors to take direct exposure at the short end of the local debt market could lower the <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in some emerging markets. <b>Real</b> <b>interest</b> rates;Adjustment process;Foreign investment;Economic models;real <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation, investors, <b>real</b> rates, foreign investors, nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> <b>interest</b> differentials, <b>real</b> exchange <b>rates,</b> inflationary expectations, monetary policy, real money, average inflation, actual inflation, nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> inflation rates, monetary economics, inflation rate, risk premium, inflation data, global capital, rational expectations, international capital market, measure of inflation...|$|R

The results from an estimated panel VAR with monthly data show that, while monetary policy shocks had negligible effects on long-term <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> shocks to the long-term <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> had a one-to-one effect on the short nominal rate...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} financial dollarization and systemic risks in the determination of <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in Brazil. In a simple currency-choice portfolio model, we show that a strategy of reducing dollarization, if it fails to address fundamental macroeconomic risks, leads to higher domestic <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> We confirm this prediction in an empirical panel-based model, involving systemic risk variables, but find that the effect is small after controlling for the risks of dilution and default. We apply our empirical estimates {{to the case of}} Brazil - a natural case study given its low degree of financial dollarization and very high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The estimated model is unable to explain the high <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> levels in the aftermath of Brazil's 1994 inflation stabilization. However, since the adoption in 1999 of inflation targeting and floating exchange <b>rates,</b> Brazil's <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are found to be gradually converging to the model's predicted values. The estimation also shows that further reductions in Brazil's <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> could be achieved through sound fundamentals that led to investment-grade status rather than financial dollarization...|$|R

Since this is a non-dynamic model, there is a fixed relationship between the nominal interest rate and the <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> (the former equals the latter plus the expected inflation rate which is exogenous in the short run); therefore variables such as money demand which actually depend on the nominal interest rate can equivalently be expressed as depending on the <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} occurrences of {{business}} cycles {{have caused the}} fluctuations of <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the US. Based on a standard consumption-based asset pricing model, the model incorporates a new feature that investors have {{to learn about the}} unobservable alternations between expansions and recessions. The model captures the qualitative property that <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> increase with expected future consumption growth. The simulation technique of the Gibbs Sampling is used to estimate and calibrate the model. It is discovered that the conditional variances of consumption growth are too small to be modeled as a time-vary volatility process. This finding casts doubt on Weitzman (2007). Furthermore, the model largely duplicates the dynamics of <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> prior to Year 1980. However, it fails to yield the drastic increase in the <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> during the 1981 - 1982 Recession, which was mainly caused by the quick tightening of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. It is concluded that the consumption-based asset pricing models without a monetary perspective are difficult to fully capture the dynamics of <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the US data...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{conventional}} perception that high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> {{are bad for}} economic growth. However, the authors show that close examination of the experience over the last 40 years undermines {{the existence of such}} a relationship. For much of the 1950 - 79 period, expost <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were less than the growth rate of income in the major economies, whereas the 1980 s were a period of rapid growth in the world economy that coincided withunprecedentedly high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> The authors stress that the critical question is whether <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> have had an adverse effect on economic growth, not why they have been high in the recent past. To test this, the literature on cointegration is used to explore whether world <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and growth rates equilibrate in the long run. The econometric evidence disputes the view that high <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are associated with low economic growth in industrial countries. What does this analysis imply for the consequences of high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> in the future? One implication is that high <b>real</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may not matter for growth performance if more productive investment results. If there is a negative impact of higher <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on growth, it will probably affect developing countries more. Further research might consider the role of human capital and institutional constraints in determining the ambiguous relationship between world <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and growth in developing countries.
