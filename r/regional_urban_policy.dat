The paper {{provides}} {{a contribution to}} the debate on the model of <b>regional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>policy</b> in Poland. The authors present aims, rules and major instruments of urban policy proposed for the self-government of the Małopolskie Voivodeship. They are a result of broader studies on urban development in the Małopolskie Region and its determinants carried out by the team of researchers of the Jagiellonian University and the Cracow University of Economics in 2012 - 2013. The authors argue that <b>regional</b> <b>urban</b> <b>policy</b> should focus on urban functional areas rather than on towns and cities only and should put strong emphasis on the facilitating of co-operation of various public and private stakeholders within the region...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, in many European {{countries}} and cities, area-based Urban Development Programmes have been initiated, {{in response to}} major problems of poverty and social exclusion. Urban Development Programmes are usually developed in a complex interplay between different governmental levels, and implemented by {{a wide variety of}} public and non-public parties. This paper addresses the organisation of these programmes, concentrating in particular on the form and extent of 'public-public partnership', i. e. on the role that the different levels of the public administration play, both through the administrative system and through policy-making. The 'empirical' basis for the paper consists of case studies, derived from the UGIS project ('Urban Governance, Social Inclusion and Sustainability,' a research project financed by the European Commission, DG RTD). The short analysis makes clear that both the model of public administration, in terms of the extent and form of decentralisation, and the presence (or lack) of a national policy framework {{determine the extent to which}} UDPs can be planned, approved and implemented at the local level. One of the main findings is that the central influence over UDPs depends more on the <b>urban</b> <b>policy</b> framework of the central government than on the model of public administration of a country. Countries with strong national (<b>regional)</b> <b>urban</b> <b>policies,</b> sufficient decentralisation of public administration to the municipal level and the use of governance methods at the local level open up possibilities for successful UDPs. Without upper-level <b>urban</b> <b>policy</b> frameworks UDPs might be successful as well, but their replicability and the control over their external effects will not be ensured.

The methodology used has been departed from land-use, transport and census data, and using ArcGIS and TransCAD a group of spatial indicators is calculated and introduced in a family of regression models, where explained variables are per capita land consumption and excess commuting respectively. The results suggest that polynucleation has little effect both in the reduction of land consumption and excess commuting.

The results of the EU-RHDI show a clear north-west/south-east divide across EU regions {{when it comes to the}} overall index. Within countries differences exist as to regional performance in human development. In general, capital city regions seem to outperform non-capital city regions within countries. This is readily seen across regions in eastern EU member states where the large intra-country differences in scores are largely driven by the capital city outperforming other regions by a length. Zooming in on the results of the individual dimensions, we find in general that the EU is especially characterized by a west/east divide. In health, southern regions are often outperforming northern regions. However, southern regions’ relative good performance in health contrasts sharply with their underperformance in income and especially knowledge. JRC.

The importance of the urban green component of the European Settlement Map (ESM) increases under the light of the absence of a homogenous layer in such coverage and resolution to be used in urban analysis. The ESM, the first European Map of the built-up, was initially published in July 2014. It is part of the URBA project initiated by the Joint Research Centre and funded by the Directorate-General for <b>Regional</b> and <b>Urban</b> <b>Policy</b> (DG REGIO). In the beginning, the ESM was not intended to provide a green layer. However, the urban green gradually started receiving increasing interest from the users of the ESM. Since there were spectral bands available in the Copernicus Core 003 dataset on which the ESM was adopted, eventually the green component was integrated with the built-up. This report addresses the quality assessment of the urban green component of the ESM defining thresholds over common vegetation indexes.

Our research adopts a bottom-up approach to urban systems, considering the agglomeration mechanism {{and effects of}} different <b>regional</b> and <b>urban</b> <b>policies,</b> and simulates the individual actions of diverse agents on a real city using an Agent-based model (ABM). Simulating the individual actions of diverse agents on a real city and measuring the resulting system behaviour and outcomes over time, they effectively provide a good test bed for evaluating the impact of different policies. The database is created merging the Swiss official secondary data for one reference year (2011) with Eurostat and OECD-Regpat. The results highlight that the understanding of municipalities’ functions on the territory appears to be essential for designing a solid institutional agglomeration (or city). From a methodological point of view, we contribute to improve the application of territorial ABM. Finally, our results provide a robust base to evaluate in a dynamic way various political interventions, {{in order to ensure}} a sustainable development of the agglomeration and the surrounding territories. Applying the analyses and the model on a larger scale, including further regions and conurbations, and including more indicators and variables, to obtain a more detailed and characteristic model, will constitute a further step of the research. ...|$|R
