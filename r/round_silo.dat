50|$|The Hosford-Sherman Farm {{is located}} in rural {{northern}} Poultney, its many farm complex divided by VT 30, about 0.5 mi north of its junction with Saltis Road. Set among open fields, the dominant elements of the farm complex are its house and barn, both of which stand near the road. The barn, on the west side, is a large 2-1/2 story post-and-beam structure, with a late 19th-century core, to which a number of additions {{have been made in}} the late 19th and 20th centuries. A cross-gabled addition with overhead door at its center defines the street-facing front, and there is a <b>round</b> <b>silo</b> at the rear. The house, located across the street, is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, with an older attached 1-1/2 story ell. Basically vernacular, it is five bays wide, with end chimneys and an unframed center entrance. Behind the house is a combination tool shed and chicken house.|$|E
50|$|The {{settlement}} at Tel Michal was not destroyed {{during the}} region's conquest by Alexander the Great, ushering the Hellenistic period, though {{it appears to}} have been abandoned {{by the end of the}} 4th century BCE. Settlement was renewed shortly thereafter, but was completely different in character. The high mound was dominated by a large fortress, 20 by 25 meters, with a central courtyard. Nearby, excavations uncovered a number of houses and a kiln. The northern hill was not resettled, housing a large wine press instead. The installation contained two collection vats, the larger of which had a capacity of 7,000 liters, suggesting a communal role. The northeastern hillock continued to serve a cultic purpose, housing a courtyard containing an altar, while the eastern hillock housed a <b>round</b> <b>silo.</b> A hoard of 47 silver tetradrachms found near the silo contains coins from the reigns of Ptolemy I through Ptolemy III, dating stratum V to the third century BCE. Stratum IV, uncovered on the high mound, testifies to habitation during Seleucid rule over the region (second century BCE). Seleucid control of the site probably ended with John Hyrcanus' conquest of Jaffa.|$|E
50|$|The {{excavations}} unearthed four architectural complexes. Each {{consists of}} a closed courtyard with rounded or rectangular rooms and numerous <b>rounded</b> <b>silos.</b> Four burials were found within or adjacent to silos. Outside the settlement a well was cut into the water table, approximately 6.5 m in depth.|$|R

It includes the 16-sided portion of the barn, calf wing and driveway, driveway ramp with stone embankment, two <b>round</b> <b>silos</b> and a frame addition. The barn was built in 1883 and is a three story frame structure, 100 feet in diameter.|$|R
5000|$|In his 1870 visit, French {{explorer}} Victor Guérin described Salhab as [...] "A little town, now destroyed, {{on a hill}} whose rocky {{sides are}} pierced by numerous cisterns. The place which it occupied is now covered with confused materials, the remains of demolished dwellings, and disposed {{for the most part}} in circular heaps <b>round</b> <b>silos</b> or subterranean magazines cut in the rock." [...] According to the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem (ARIJ), the modern settlement was re-established on the ancient khirba ("ruin") in 1880 by a family from Nablus. After the death of the family's head, Salhab's lands were sold to immigrants coming from present-day Lebanon and Iraq. Nonetheless, no population for the village was recorded in the 1931 British census of Palestine.|$|R

40|$|The Project in Tell el-Murra in {{the northeastern}} part of the Nile Delta {{continued}} excavation of trench S 3, uncovering two graves from the Early Dynastic period as well as mud-brick walls belonging to earlier structures. A new trench, S 4, was dug to check the site stratigraphy and chronology {{in the eastern part}} of the site. Old Kingdom and Naqada III pottery was discovered and Lower Egyptian Culture layers were confirmed at the bottom of the latter trench. Architectural remains consisted of a <b>round</b> <b>silos(?)</b> and walls to the west and south of it. The present research confirmed the existence of settlement on the site from the times of the Predynastic Lower Egyptian Culture until the end of the Old Kingdom (Sixth Dynasty), but it is still unclear whether people of the Naqada culture appeared there already in the second half of the Naqada II period or only in Naqada III. It was also confirmed that a settlement and a cemetery existed on the site...|$|R

50|$|Unfortunately, since mid-1939 no new {{detailed}} discoveries or thorough {{research has}} been completed at the tell except for recent work done by Barry Kemp, from the University of Cambridge. Since 2001, the Tell Edfu project has been directed by Nadine Moeller (Oriental Institute, University of Chicago). The current work focuses on {{the eastern part of}} the site. So far the administrative centre of the ancient town has been discovered with remains of a columned hall dating to the late Middle Kingdom as well as a large granary courtyard that functioned as a grain reserve for this provincial capital. Latter dates to the Second Intermediate Period (17th Dynasty). At least seven large <b>round</b> <b>silos</b> have been excavated here with a diameter between 5.5 and 6.5 meters which makes them the largest ones so far discovered within an ancient Egyptian urban centre.No larger remains dating earlier than the 5th Dynasty have been found at Edfu. The ancient cemetery comprised mastabas of the Old Kingdom as well as later tombs. Before the beginning of the New Kingdom, the necropolis was transferred to Hager Edfu, to the west and then in the Late period to the south at Nag’ el-Hassaya. The entire area was called Behedet. The god Horus was herein worshipped as Horus Behedet.|$|R
40|$|Tell el-Murra, {{located in}} the {{north-eastern}} part of the Nile Delta, {{is the subject of}} excavations conducted by the Institute of Archaeology of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków, following surveys carried out in 2008 and 2010 - 11. Settlement remains dating to the Predynastic Lower Egyptian culture {{through the end of the}} Old Kingdom period as well as an Early Dynastic cemetery have been explored. This report focuses on the results of recent research in the south-western (trench S 3 and test trench S 3 B) and north-eastern (trench T 5) parts of the site, conducted in the 2013 - 15 excavation seasons. In trench S 3, 23 graves from the Early Dynastic period were explored and several others located, including both, simple pit burials and chamber graves. The bodies were usually laid on and covered by matting. In seveeral cases, they were buried in pottery cofÞ ns. The burial goods comprised mainly pottery and stone vessels. In trench T 5, remains of the settlement from the Old Kingdom period were explored, including storage pits and <b>rounded</b> <b>silos</b> as well as rectangular buildings constructed from dried bricks. The pottery material comprised mostly potsherds; however, a few complete or almost complete vessels were attested as well. Petrographic analyses of pottery samples and an archaeozoological study of bones collected from both the settlement and cemetery are also presented...|$|R

40|$|The {{subject of}} the study is a {{functional}} analysis of the settlements in the valley of the Lower Habur dating to {{the first half of the}} third millennium. In Chapter 1 the geo-climatic conditions of the region and the research history as well as the results of the latest research and the aims of the study are presented. The mostly unpublished results of the salvage excavations at Tall Knedig serve as the fundamental basis for the interpretation of the settlement functions (Chapter 2). The excavations brought to light 14 architectural units, including some storage buildings (three <b>round</b> <b>silos</b> and one multicellular building). In the houses many installations and objects were found which indicate domestic activities like food preparation (fire places, tannours, grinding stones) and also storing (pits, chambers or storage jars). The economic analysis has shown that the households from Tall Knedig had an agricultural background, indicators for craft specialization, however, could not be proven. The storage structures suggest that most households could either store their yearly requirements of grain or even had capacity for some reserves. A few storage facilities had clearly more capacity then was used for the needs of their associated households. Bricked-up entrances as well as other features lead to the assumption that some of the inhabitants of Tall Knedig used their houses only seasonally. The settlement was surrounded by a massive brick wall during the first half of the third millennium. In Chapter 3 all other excavated sites of the Lower Habur region with traces of occupation from the era are discussed. Aside from Tall Knedig twelve settlements - partly with extensive storage facilities - were excavated. From the inventory of some of these so called store rooms it is concluded that not all of them were used exclusively for storage purposes. To get a more precise picture of the relations between these settlements it was necessary to develop a regional chronological framework for the first half of the third millennium (Chapter 4). The sequence of the pottery and other characteristics permit a subdivision in three phases. Moreover it is outlined how the urban centres of the adjacent regions correspond with these chronological phases. In Chapter 5 the settlements in the Lower Habur valley, recorded during two survey seasons by the Tübinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients, are analysed. The surface material indicates that nine further sites - in addition to the excavated settlements - were occupied during the first half of the third millennium. The material of a number of sites provides no clear evidence for settlement activities. Most of the settlements along the river valley were small villages of less than one ha in size, whereas only one larger village (Tall Knedig, 3 ha) and one small town (Tall Bderi, 6 ha) could be identified. The vast majority of the sites were situated in the northern part of the Lower Habur region. In the southern river valley only a few settlements were located - at a long but equal distance from each other. The study of the sites has shown that their subsistence, based on farming, livestock (including seasonally migratory herders) and hunting, was to a high degree dependent on the ecological conditions. These were (and still are) characterized by variabilities which caused to a certain degree a flexibility in the economical behaviour. This is reflected to some extent by the numerous storage facilities. There are so far no indications for the assumption, that the rural sites in the Lower Habur valley were tied to large urban centres outside the region...|$|R
