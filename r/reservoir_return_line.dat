40|$|A {{heat pipe}} is a heat {{transfer}} device {{of very high}} thermal conductance that features two-phase flow. Research at McGill University {{has led to the}} development of the McGill Heat Pipe which includes an internal flow modifier. Such a heat pipe can be operated at very high heat fluxes. This area of heat pipe technology has potential in many applications in metallurgical industries. This thesis describes how the McGill heat pipe was developed, tested, modeled and applied in high heat flux situations. Until the development of the McGill Heat Pipe, three main issues had prevented the successful use of heat pipe technology in high heat flux applications. These relate to limitations imposed by film boiling, dry-out, and the structure of the flow. The McGill Heat Pipe has successfully addressed and overcome these limitations. To overcome film boiling and dry-out, a flow modifier was developed. The structure of the flow was changed by introducing a <b>reservoir</b> and a <b>return</b> <b>line.</b> This thesis describes some of the work that is being carried out to develop and evaluate families of flow modifiers, or spiral springs. Results from a number of high flux experiments will be detailed and the effects of the flow modifiers for each case will be described. In addition, the velocity of the return water was visualized with magnesium alloy chips and was measured with a video camera. Comparisons of the operation of the heat pipe both with and without a flow modifier are presented. This is the first study of its kind in which a transparent glass <b>return</b> <b>line</b> and particles were used to visualize the liquid flow in the <b>return</b> <b>line</b> of the heat pipe...|$|R
50|$|Pressure {{flows from}} the {{hydraulic}} circuit to the suspension cylinders, pressurizing the bottom part of the spheres and suspension cylinders. Suspension works {{by means of a}} piston forcing LHM into the sphere, compacting the nitrogen in {{the upper part of the}} sphere; damping is provided by a two-way 'leaf valve' in the opening of the sphere. LHM has to squeeze back and forth through this valve which causes resistance and controls the suspension movements. It is the simplest damper and one of the most efficient. Ride height correction (self levelling) is achieved by height corrector valves connected to the anti-roll bar, front and rear. When the car is too low, the height corrector valve opens to allow more fluid into the suspension cylinder (e.g., the car is loaded). When the car is too high (e.g. after unloading) fluid is returned to the system <b>reservoir</b> via low-pressure <b>return</b> <b>lines.</b> Height correctors act with some delay in order not to correct regular suspension movements. The rear brakes are powered from the rear suspension circuit. Because the pressure there is proportional to the load, so is the braking power.|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} hydraulic system performance using vegetable-based palm oil as hydraulic fluid. Design/methodology/approach - The hydraulic system performance test at different operating conditions, such as pressure, speed and oil ageing, was performed using a Yuken vane pump test rig. The endurance system performance test was also conducted for 200 and 400 h. The effect of speed on flow slip coefficient in discrete and continuous tests was studied. In discrete testing, pressure of 35 and 200 bar and speed of 750 and 1, 439 rpm were used in determining flow slip coefficient. The instantaneous data were recorded in a computer using an analog-to-digital data acquisition system with respect to time and the parameters stored were <b>reservoir</b> temperature, <b>return</b> <b>line</b> temperature, suction and delivery pressures, instantaneous flow rate, total flow, total running time and torque. The obtained results were interpolated for future prediction of the system performance. Findings - The experimental and interpolated results showed that slip coefficient decreases with increasing pump speed. The effect of aging condition on volumetric efficiency showed that the efficiency increases with aging period due to increase in oil viscosity. Practical implications - This vegetable-based palm oil could be a potentially useful substitute for mineral-based energy transport media such as hydraulic fluid. Originality/value - The investigation of hydraulic system performance using palm oil as hydraulic fluid is scarce in the literature. Therefore, the current study is quite new for the hydraulic system performance and it is hoped that it will provide a high value to researchers for further research before it can be used as hydraulic fluid...|$|R
40|$|Todays {{concern of}} {{protecting}} the environment has encouraged the research {{and the use of}} environmental friendly products. This project initiates the experimental investigation of using palm based oil as hydraulic fluid. This research was aimed at obtaining a better understanding of short term performance and long term durability of palm based oil working as hydraulic fluid. A vane pump test rig was designed and built. The instantaneous data were recorded in a computer using an analog-to-digital data acquisition system. The rig was integrated with LabVIEW software version 6. 1. Among the data stored are <b>reservoir</b> and <b>return</b> <b>line</b> temperatures, suction and delivery pressures, instantaneous flow rate, total flow, total running time and torque. Test rig performance running on palm oil was determined and monitored. In order to predict the oil performance in the test rig operation, bench tests were also conducted in evaluating the thermal and rheological performance of the oil. The bench tests gave useful insight to the performance of the actual test rig. Some improvement of the oil was made and tested on the hydraulic test rig. The results indicate that ageing process was significantly improved by the additived oil. The investigation also indicates that flow slip, viscous friction, and coulomb friction coefficients were affected by oil and hydraulic component conditions. Non-Newtonian behavior of the oil had been analyzed using five rheological models. It was found that Cross and Carreau rheological models provided best correlation coefficient (R 2 > 0. 999) to the oil under investigation. The palm oil had relatively strong shear thinning behavior with flow behavior index (n) lower than 0. 8 compared to mineral hydraulic oil (n> 0. 9). However this effect was less pronounced at high temperatures. Modified power law and generalized models were proposed to study variation of Newtonian level of the oil with temperature and shear rate. Thermal stability of the oils was also investigated using thermogravimetry analysis (TGA). Based on thermodynamic activation energy (Ea), onset temperature and acid value, the recommended treat level for F 10 additive is between 1. 5 % to 2 % (wt/wt) while for L 135 additive is 1. 5 % (wt/wt). In the aspect of tribology, more than 60 % wear occurred during the first 500 hours of operation. In general, the results show that the additived palm oil is comparable if not better than the commercial biodegradable hydraulic fluid that is derived from rapeseed oil...|$|R

5000|$|The {{traditional}} {{hot water}} recirculation system uses a dedicated <b>return</b> <b>line</b> {{from the point}} of use located farthest from the hot water tank back to the hot water tank. In homes where this <b>return</b> <b>line</b> was not installed the cold water line is used as a <b>return</b> <b>line.</b> The first of two system types has a pump mounted at the hot water heater while a [...] "normally open" [...] thermostatic control valve gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater and closes once hot water contacts the valve to control crossover flow between the hot and cold lines. A second type of system uses a thermostatically controlled pump which gets installed at the farthest fixture from the water heater. These thermostatically controlled pumps often have a built-in [...] "normally closed" [...] check-valve which prevents water in the cold water line from entering into the hot water line. Compared to a dedicated <b>return</b> <b>line,</b> using the cold water <b>line</b> as a <b>return</b> has the disadvantage of heating the cold water pipe (and the contained water). Accurate temperature monitoring and active flow control can minimize loss of cold water within the cold water line.|$|R
