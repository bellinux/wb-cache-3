500|$|Tesla's {{theories}} gained {{support from}} Lord Kelvin who, while visiting the United States in 1902, {{was reported to}} have said that he thought Tesla had picked up Martian signals being sent to the United States. Kelvin [...] "emphatically" [...] denied this report shortly before departing America: [...] "What I <b>really</b> <b>said</b> was that the inhabitants of Mars, if there are any, were doubtless able to see New York, particularly the glare of the electricity." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, André 3000 and Big Boi {{abandon the}} [...] "hard-partying playa characters" [...] of their debut album {{in favor of}} more spacey, funky, and futuristic personas on ATLiens. [...] With their lyrics, the duo hoped to reflect on {{maturity}} {{in the wake of the}} birth of Big Boi's daughter. [...] André 3000 explained, [...] "It's like everybody's talking about sipping champagne and being big time, so we just took it upon ourselves to do something new... I want my children to say, 'Daddy <b>really</b> <b>said</b> something, he wasn't just trying to brag on himself.'" [...] Many songs on ATLiens feature more unconventional subject matter for hip hop. [...] The lyrical content ranges from addressing urban life as hustlers and pimps to extraterrestrial life and space travel. The title track's chorus expresses Southern pride, while its verses feature André 3000 explaining his newly adopted drug-free lifestyle.|$|E

2500|$|He paints, {{or rather}} regards, {{things in a}} way that is {{different}} from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, is all he paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule [...] "not complete", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has <b>really</b> <b>said</b> everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.|$|E
2500|$|Ronald L. Meek {{concluded}} that {{in dealing with}} Marx, academics often abandoned scholarly standards of fact-finding, evidential support and proof, and Hal Draper referred to the disease of [...] "Marxolalia" [...] ("the propensity to garble Marx"). The British radical Cyril Smith even claimed in 2005 that “It would not be overstating the situation to say that, {{right down to the}} present day, the “Marxists” have been among the most direct and bitter opponents of the ideas of Karl Marx.” The total effect was, that for more than a century, people were miseducated about what Marx <b>really</b> <b>said</b> and stood for; his ideas were constantly being filtered through theoretical frameworks and political intentions that were far removed from his own.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} of the Smile era, Wilson had indulged himself in works ranging from the I Ching and Subud philosophy, tracts on astrology, {{detailed}} charts of the stars and planets, various topics of mysticism, The Little Prince, the novels of Hermann Hesse, works by Kahlil Gibran, Rod McKuen, and Walter Benton's This is My Beloved. In a reported meeting at Wilson's home between him and novelist Thomas Pynchon—a fan of Pet Sounds—the two were so intimidated by each other that [...] "neither of them <b>really</b> <b>said</b> a word all night long." [...] Wilson had also developed an obsession with the Del Close and John Brent comedy album How to Speak Hip (1959), and attempted to reference it in Pet Sounds with the provisional song title [...] "And Then We'll Have World Peace".|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Murphy Brown speech" [...] {{became one}} of the most memorable {{incidents}} of the 1992 campaign. Long after the outcry had ended, the comment continued to have an effect on U.S. politics. Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family history and the author of several books and essays about the history of marriage, says that this brief remark by Quayle about Murphy Brown [...] "kicked off more than a decade of outcries against the 'collapse of the family. In 2002, Candice Bergen, the actress who played Brown, said [...] "I never have <b>really</b> <b>said</b> much about the whole episode, which was endless, but his speech was a perfectly intelligent speech about fathers not being dispensable and nobody agreed with that more than I did." [...] Others interpreted it differently; singer Tanya Tucker was widely quoted as saying [...] "Who the hell is Dan Quayle to come after single mothers?" ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{subsequent}} {{editions of}} The Origin of Species, Darwin acknowledged Matthew's earlier work, stating that Matthew [...] "clearly saw...the {{full force of}} the principle of natural selection". It is an urban myth that, from 1860 onward, Matthew would claim credit for natural selection and even had calling cards printed with Discoverer of the Principle of Natural Selection. This probably started with Loren Eiseley (1958. Darwin's Century), who apparently misunderstood a comment made by Darwin in a letter to Hooker (22 and 28 October 1865). Concerning the finding that William Charles Wells had published the idea of evolutionary change through natural selection before Matthew, Darwin wrote to Hooker: [...] "So poor old Patrick Matthew, is not the first, & he cannot or ought not any longer put on his Title pages “Discoverer {{of the principle of}} Natural Selection”!" [...] However, this was already inaccurate on Darwin's part. What the title page of Matthew's pamphlet Schleswig-Holstein <b>really</b> <b>said</b> was: ...|$|E
2500|$|Jackson {{said his}} {{comments}} about homosexuals {{have been taken}} out of context, and that they were directed not towards the general LGBT community, just its more politically active, fringe members. Of past comments that homosexuality [...] "poisons culture", he clarified, [...] "What I <b>really</b> <b>said</b> was that the gay rights movement, so called, the homosexual activists, engage in some behavior that is absolutely horrendous, and that’s true, everybody knows that; from going into Catholic churches and desecrating the Sacraments to engaging in all kinds of demonstrative behavior to try to call attention to what they view as their plight." [...] He added, [...] "I respect every human being, I don't believe that there's any second-class citizens in Virginia, I don't treat anybody any differently because of their sexual orientation." [...] He also says that his statements on homosexuality should be seen as a preacher talking about what he believes the Bible says, not a political candidate's views on how he would govern.|$|E

2500|$|The herpetologist Laurence Monroe Klauber proposed, in a tongue-in-cheek article which blames Dr. Watson {{for getting}} {{the name of the}} snake wrong, a theory that the swamp adder was an {{artificial}} hybrid between the Mexican Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and Naja naja. His speculation suggests that Doyle might have hidden a double-meaning in Holmes' words. What Holmes said, reported by Watson, was [...] "It is a swamp adder, the deadliest snake in India"; but Klauber suggested what Holmes <b>really</b> <b>said</b> was [...] "It is a samp-aderm, the deadliest skink in India." [...] Samp-aderm can be translated [...] "snake-Gila-monster": Samp is Hindi for snake, and the suffix aderm is derived from heloderm, the common or vernacular name of the Gila monster generally used by European naturalists. Skinks are lizards of the family Scincidae, many of which are snake-like in form. Such a hybrid reptile will have a venom incomparably strengthened by hybridization, assuring the almost instant demise of the victim. And it will also have ears like any lizard, so it could hear the whistle, and legs and claws allowing it to run up and down the bell cord with a swift ease.|$|E
2500|$|In August 1968, the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia {{to crush}} the liberalising reforms of Alexander Dubček's {{government}} during what {{was known as the}} Prague Spring. [...] Prague-born Palach decided to sacrifice himself in protest of the invasion and set himself on fire, in Wenceslas Square, on 16 January 1969. According to a letter he sent to several public figures, an entire clandestine resistance organization had been established with the purpose of practicing self-immolation until their demands were met; however, it seems that such a group never existed. The demands declared in the letter were the abolition of censorship and a halt to the distribution of Zprávy, the official newspaper of the Soviet occupying forces. In addition, the letter called for the Czech and the Slovak peoples to go on a general strike in support of these demands. An earlier draft of the letter that Palach wrote also called for the resignation of a number of pro-Soviet politicians, but that demand did not make it into the final version, which included the remark that [...] "our demands are not extreme, on the contrary". Palach died from his burns several days after his act, at the hospital. On his deathbed, he was visited by a female acquaintance from his college and by a student leader, to whom he had addressed one of the copies of his letter. It was reported that he had pleaded for others not to do what he had done but instead to continue the struggle by other means, although it has been doubted whether he <b>really</b> <b>said</b> that.|$|E
2500|$|The shoot {{took place}} in Arizona during October. The crew were unused to the improvisational, {{on-the-fly}} directing style that Russell implemented. Rather than preparing organized shot lists, Russell preferred to use ideas as they came to him, often asking for longer hours. Early on, some of the crew began to feel a dislike for these methods and Russell along with them. Clooney noted that [...] "there's an element of David that was in way over his head... he was vulnerable and selfish, and it would manifest itself {{in a lot of}} yelling." [...] When Russell's frustration would lead to outbursts, Clooney would take it upon himself to defend crew members and extras, leading to increased tensions. When an extra had an epileptic seizure on set, Clooney ran to his aid while Russell apparently remained indifferent to the matter. Afterward, Clooney criticized Russell for ignoring the incident, though Russell later stated that he was busy setting up a shot some yards away from the extra and was not aware that the extra had suffered a seizure. Another on-set conflict between the two arose while shooting footage on a Humvee with a camera mounted to it. Clooney recalls Russell yelling at the driver to drive faster. Clooney then approached the director, telling him to [...] "knock it off". Russell remembers the incident differently: [...] "The camera broke, we were losing the day and I was upset about that. So I jumped off the truck and I was like, 'Fuck!' I was just kicking the dirt and everything like that. And then George had this big thing about defending the driver, whom I hadn't <b>really</b> <b>said</b> anything to." [...] During the shoot, Clooney was exhausted as he was still shooting ER in Los Angeles three days a week, while working on Three Kings the other four.|$|E

2500|$|On October 3, 2009, {{an online}} column by Fox Sports {{baseball}} writer Ken Rosenthal reported of a mutiny in the Blue Jays' clubhouse against Gaston by his players and {{some members of}} his coaching staff. Rosenthal cited unnamed sources who claimed that the mutiny {{was a result of}} his impatience with the players after they started losing, partially reflected with players getting less playing time, his lack of communication, including his inability to properly communicate substitutions, and his negativity, especially {{when it came to the}} younger players who required more positive reinforcement. A day after the report, Blue Jays first baseman Lyle Overbay was quoted as being one of the players who was surprised over his lack of playing time as well as wanting Gaston to improve his communication. [...] "More than anything, I want to try to figure out what to expect for next year. It kind of caught me off-guard a little bit when I wasn't playing. ... (Gaston) never <b>really</b> <b>said</b> a lot. As we were winning, he was kind of sitting on the back burner, watching us play good." [...] When asked about the report on the clubhouse mutiny, Gaston replied that he was surprised that such criticism existed. [...] "If you've got two or three or four guys in there that have a problem, then you don't have to win anything, do you? You might have to certainly deal with those guys, but you don't have to win the clubhouse back. I don't think that you can ... rely (on a few) players to find out (if there's a problem). I think you need to talk to all of them. If it comes up to 50 percent, then, hey, maybe we've got a problem. I'd like to know what the problem is because I can't be any fairer than I've been." ...|$|E
