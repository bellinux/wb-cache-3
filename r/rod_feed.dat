40|$|A {{dielectric}} <b>rod</b> <b>feed</b> with {{a special}} radiation pattern of a tabletop form used for the compact range reflector is developed and analyzed. Application of this feed increases {{the size of the}} compact range quiet zone generated by the reflector. The feed consists of the dielectric rod made of polystyren, the rod is inserted into the circular waveguide with a corrugated flange. The waveguide is excited by the H 11 -mode. The rod is covered by the textolite biconical bushing and has a fluoroplastic insert {{in the vicinity of the}} bushing. Mathematical modeling was used to obtain the parameters of the feed for the optimal tabletop form of the radiation pattern. The problem of the electromagnetic radiation was solved for metal-dielectric bodies of rotation by method of integral equations with further solving of the problem of the synthesis for feed parameters. The dielectric <b>rod</b> <b>feed</b> was fabricated for the X-frequency range. Feed amplitude and phase patterns were measured in the frequency range 8. 2 - 12. 5 GHz. Presented results of mathematical modeling and measurements for X-range radiation patterns correlate well. It is shown that this feed increases by 20 - 25 % the quiet zone of the compact range with reflector in the form of nonsymmetrical cutting of the paraboloid of revolution 5. 0 x 4. 5 m in size in the frequency range 8. 5 - 10. 0 GHz as compared to a conical horn feed.

The model accounts for conduction-dominated heat transport in the melt, <b>feed</b> <b>rod</b> and growing crystal and for radiation between these phases, the ambient and a heater. Surface tension acting on the shape of the melt/gas meniscus counteracts gravity to set the shape of the molten zone.

The present paper deals with urgent demands in these fields, with attention on pollution decreasing/removal. A survey of European Topic Centre on Waste, based on partial data only, points out the risk of sewage and leachate contamination of subsoil and waterbed for 13500 landfills. The European Council, in the Directive 97 /C _ 76 / 01, requests the member states to take the necessary measures to ensure, to fullest practicable extent, that old-landfills and polluting-sites should be rehabilitated. This request is specifically addressed, with the Microdrainage project, EVK 4 -CT- 2002 - 30012, successfully achieved building the robotic prototype, properly operative from mid 2005.

The mechanical architecture needs proper sophistication, to deal with rods supplying along the micro-tunnel, local buffering to complete the lay-down of a draining line, and mast feeding by the purposely designed arm. The system implementation, thereafter, tackles with the severe technical specifications for the micro-tunnel surroundings, and exacting performance requirements in rig levelling, mast attitude accuracy and work-task sequencing.

40|$|The {{mammalian}} retina provides several {{pathways to}} relay {{the information from}} the photoreceptors to the ganglion cells. Cones feed into ON and OFF cone bipolar cells that excite ON and OFF ganglion cells, respectively. In the "classical" <b>rod</b> pathway, <b>rods</b> <b>feed</b> into <b>rod</b> bipolar cells that provide input to both the ON and the OFF pathway via AII amacrine cells. Recent evidence suggests an alternative rod pathway in which rods directly contact some types of OFF cone bipolar cells. The mouse has become an important model system for retinal research. We performed an immunohistochemical analysis on the level of light and electron microscopy to identify the bipolar cells and ganglion cells that are involved in the alternative rod pathway of the mouse retina. 1) We identify a new bipolar cell type, showing that type 3 OFF cone bipolar cells comprise two distinct cell types, that we termed 3 a and 3 b. Type 3 a cells express the ion channel HCN 4. Type 3 b bipolar cells represent a hitherto unknown cell type that can be identified with antibodies against the regulatory subunit RIIbeta of protein kinase A. 2) We show that both 3 a and 3 b cells form flat contacts at cone pedicles and rod spherules. 3) Finally, we identify an OFF ganglion cell type whose dendrites costratify with type 3 a and 3 b bipolar cell axon terminals.

Due to the strong segregation problems as expected form the phase diagram already arose during preliminary runs.

Solid polycrystalline <b>feed</b> <b>rods</b> could be prepared starting from the Ge-rich side of the phase diagram by applying RF-heated zone melting in Boron Nitride (BN) and Quartz ampoules up to concentrations of about 14 at% (diameter = 12 mm, 1 #approx# 100 mm). To overcome the lack of Si-rich <b>feed</b> <b>rods</b> a insitu alloying method was developed introducing Ge into Si only during the runs gradually.

40|$|Tungsten Inert Gas welding {{is a very}} {{effective}} welding process widely used in many industries for joining of sheets, stainless steel pipes, automobile parts and many other manufacturing processes. This welding process has an additional advantage of protecting the weld bead {{with the help of}} shielding gas or inert gas which avoids the oxidation of the bead, making the joint wear resistant and slag free. This has increased the demand of TIG welding extensively. Generally, it is done manually by holding filler rod in one hand and the TIG torch with other. Thus, the process requires a high amount of skill and human labor. Automation of TIG welding will not only reduce human labor but also improve accuracy. The project aims to develop and design an automated filler <b>rod</b> <b>feeding</b> system for TIG welding. To fulfil this purpose, a number of mechanisms are considered namely rack-pinion mechanism, slider-crank mechanism and screw-nut mechanism. The advantages and limitations of each mechanism are weighed against each other to decide the best mechanism that can be implemented. The mechanism is then designed and fabricated so as to fulfil the objectives of the project. It has also been ensured that the product at the completion of this project is industry oriented and has commercial value. After a rigorous analysis of the different mechanisms possible, screw and nut mechanism was chosen to be fabricated. The feeding of the filler rod is coordinated with the movement of the TIG torch. The suggested mechanism is one of its first in this particular field and can prove to be a worthy replacement of the presently used wire-feeding arrangement.

40|$|The {{ion channel}} HCN 1 (hyperpolarisation-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated channel- 1) is {{expressed}} in photoreceptors of the mammalian retina. The central conclusion {{of the present study}} says that HCN 1 in rods counteracts saturation of light responses by bright light stimuli. The mammalian retina works in an intensity range that covers ten orders of magnitude. This task is achieved by two photoreceptors. The very sensitive rods are optimized for scotopic (night) vision, the less sensitive cones for photopic (day) vision. Cones relay their information via bipolar cells to the ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina. <b>Rods</b> <b>feed</b> their signals into the cone network at multiple sites. Using the patch-clamp technique, I recorded in vitro light responses of ganglion cells from retinae of normal (wild type) mice and of mice, in which the gene encoding HCN 1 had been knocked out (K. O.). Recordings were performed under different states of adaptation with contribution of only rods (scotopic), only cones (photopic), or both rods and cones (mesopic) to the light responses. Flicker stimuli of different frequencies were applied and current or voltage responses were recorded. Under scotopic and photopic conditions, no major differences were observed between light responses from wild type and from HCN 1 K. O. retinae. In both retinae, ganglion cell responses followed flicker stimuli equally well. Under mesopic conditions, light intensity was chosen such that rod responses saturated. In wild type retinae, light responses of ganglion cells were similar to those under photopic conditions. In contrast, in HCN 1 knock-out retinae light responses of ganglion cells could not even follow flicker stimuli of low frequencies. Cells responded as if they were saturated by bright and long lasting light stimuli. A second mouse line was used in which in addition the gene encoding the visual pigment of rods, rhodopsin, was knocked out. These mice have no functional rods. In those retinae, despite the absence of HCN 1 no saturation of light responses was observed. It is the task of HCN 1 in rods to counteract saturation and thus, to enable vision under mesopic conditions. First experiments were performed to analyze the pathways that relay saturating rod responses to the retinal network...|$|R

40|$|At {{very low}} light levels the {{sensitivity}} of the visual system is determined by the efficiency with which single photons are captured, and the resulting signal transmitted from the rod photoreceptors through the retinal circuitry to the ganglion cells and on to the brain. Although the tiny electrical signals due to single photons have been observed in rod photoreceptors, little is known about how these signals are preserved during subsequent transmission to the optic nerve. We find that the synaptic currents elicited by single photons in mouse rod bipolar cells have a peak amplitude of 5 [...] 6 pA, and that about 20 rod photoreceptors converge upon each rod bipolar cell. The data indicates that the first synapse, between rod photoreceptors and rod bipolar cells, signals a binary event: the detection, or not, of a photon or photons in the connected rod photoreceptors.

It was concluded that evaporation contributes substantially to impurity reduction when FZ or cold-crucible growth is conducted in a vacuum; boron and gallium may be more favorable dopants than indium or aluminum for obtaining high minority-carrier lifetimes; minority-carrier lifetimes greater than 100 microseconds are feasible at a 2 times 10 to the 17 th power cm- 3 doping level; minority-carrier lifetime decreases with increasing crystal cooling rate and also {{with the presence of}} dislocations; the method used to clean silicon <b>feed</b> <b>rods</b> affects lifetime; and microdefect densities in dislocation-free FZ crystals appear to be lower with Ga doping than with B doping...|$|R
40|$|The Ispat Inland plant {{processes}} two blends of ore during {{different time}} periods throughout the year. Although these two blends have mineralogical differences, {{they go through}} the same process. The major difference in the process becomes fineness of grind required to achieve desired level of liberation, which is in tum controlled by the <b>rod</b> mill <b>feed</b> rate. This created a unique opportunity for modeling the effect of mineralogy on separation equipment and measuring reliability of the simulator in predicting perfonnance of non-concentration equipment, such as hydrocyclones and fine screens, under different operating and feed conditions. While performance of concentration devices including magnetic separator, hydroseparator and flotation banks was expected to show dependence on variation in mineralogy, particularly on liberation size, performance of classification and screening devices would be largely independent of the liberation characteristics. Therefore, the models were expected to reasonably simulate the performance of these devices for a given blend when plant data from the other blend was available. On the other hand, performance of grinding mills is mostly governed by the grindability characteristics of a given ore type. Differences in mineralogy {{may or may not have}} significant effect on their performance, depending on whether or not change in mineralogy create significant variations in grindability. If such variation occurs, then the question is: how can it be simulated? This study could also provide a guideline for refining grinding models to account for such variations.

40|$|We {{report a}} study on the crystal growth of the {{hexagonal}} manganites RMnO_ 3 (R = Y, Lu, Ho, Er, and Tm) by using an optical floating-zone method. It was found that high-quality single crystals of R = Y, Lu, and Ho could be easily grown with essentially the same conditions as those reported in literature, that is, with an atmosphere of normal pressure Ar and oxygen mixture and a growth rate of 2 [...] 4 mm/h. However, these conditions were not feasible for growing good crystals of R = Er and Tm. The chemical analysis indicated that it was due to an off-stoichiometric phenomenon in the formed single crystals. We used an effective and simple way to resolve this problem by adjusting the nominal compositions of the polycrystal <b>feed</b> <b>rods</b> to be 1 [...] 2 % rare-earth excess. The structures and physical properties were characterized by X-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, resistivity, and dielectric constant measurements.

40|$|Abstract. As {{the main}} {{substrates}} materials for solar cell, Czochralskisilicon (CZ-Si) has more crystal defects, higher impurities content and so on, which limit the further improvement of conversion efficiency (η). Floating zone melting silicon (FZ-Si) has excellent performance but the <b>feed</b> <b>rod</b> cost is much higher, {{so it is}} hardly used for solar cell widely. To solve this problem, we developed CFZ silicon monocrystal (CFZ-Si). First the poly was made into poly rod withΦ 110 ~Φ 130 mm by CZ process and then made into CFZ-Si by FZ method. During FZ process, the resistivity is controlled by gas doping and the process is adjustable. CFZ-Si combines advantages of CZ-Si with FZ-Si. It has less crystal defects, lower impurities content especially oxygen content (< 0. 2 ppm) and excellent consistency of axial resistivity. Meanwhile, poly rod used has lower price and easier fabrication, so CFZ-Si cost is much lower and the further cost reduction is easy. Therefore, CFZ-Si has significant comprehensive advantages and broader prospect in the future photovoltaic field...|$|R
