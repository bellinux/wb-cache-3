5|$|Since 2011, {{there have}} been growing {{concerns}} that mothers-to-be from mainland China, {{in a bid to}} obtain the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong and the benefits that come with it, have saturated the neonatal wards of the city's hospitals both public and private. This has led to protest from local pregnant women for the government to remedy the issue, as they have found difficulty in securing a bed space for giving birth and routine check-ups. Other concerns in the decade of 2001–2010 relate to the workload medical staff experience; and medical errors and mishaps, which are frequently highlighted in local news.|$|E
25|$|The Hong Kong Basic Law {{came into}} effect on 1 July 1997, {{along with the}} <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> {{eligibility}} defined therein. Most Hong Kong residents became solely Chinese citizens on 1 July 1997 and continued to maintain their <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong held before the Handover. Non-Chinese citizens with Hong Kong <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> maintained their original citizenship unless they successfully naturalised as Chinese citizens.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{historical}} background of Hong Kong, immigration status in Hong Kong is determined {{by a combination of}} both nationality and residence status. Therefore, even a Chinese national with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong has a slightly different status to a foreign national with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong as well (since the former can never lose the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> status while the latter can lose it if he does not enter Hong Kong for a period of 36 months). At the same time, a foreign national with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong has a preferential immigration status to a Chinese national without the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong, as the former can remain in Hong Kong indefinitely, while the latter has to have his immigration status reassessed whenever his visa/permit expires.|$|E
50|$|The {{constitution}} of the People's Republic of China states that all persons holding nationality of the People's Republic of China are citizens of the People's Republic of China. Although in practice, the citizenship of Mainland China is the hukou, while the two special administrative regions, Hong Kong and Macau, each has their own rules on the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in these territories.|$|R
50|$|In 1981, {{under the}} British Nationality Act 1981 and {{reflecting}} {{the change in}} status toward devolved self-government (and depriving colonials <b>of</b> the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> {{and work in the}} United Kingdom), self-governing and Crown colonies were renamed 'British Dependent Territories'. This terminology caused offence to both loyalists and nationalists in the territories and was changed in 2002, by the means of the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, to British Overseas Territories.|$|R
50|$|All other colonials {{not already}} {{resident}} in the UK or the Crown Dependencies lost the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> {{and work in}} the UK when the Act went into force. This caused anger in the affected colonies as the Act, which resulted from the desire to prevent ethnic-Chinese people in Hong Kong with UK and Colonies Citizenship from migrating to the UK prior to the planned 1997 hand-over of the colony to China, was seen as racist, especially as those colonials in affected colonies who possessed a qualifying connection to the UK sufficient to retain either British citizenship or a right to remain (in the UK) notification in their BDTC passports were usually white. The former colonials also objected to being described as dependent, especially in Bermuda, which had been self-reliant virtually since 1612, and largely self-governed since 1620. This resentment was exacerbated when full British citizenship was returned to Gibraltarians, ensuring that those from territories perceived as having negligible non-white populations retained free movement into the UK, with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> and work, as did many of the whites in the remaining coloured colonies. Most non-whites in those remaining territories, by contrast, could only enter the UK as short-term visitors (with a date stamped in their passports by which they must exit) or with difficult-to-obtain entry clearances.|$|R
25|$|Vallejos and Domingo v. Commissioner of Registration was a {{court case}} against the {{government}} of Hong Kong by two foreign domestic helpers (FDHs) seeking permanent residence and the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong. Because of its subject matter it was commonly {{referred to in the}} media as the FDHs' <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> case (外傭居港權案). Evangeline Vallejos and Daniel Domingo were two of five applicants who in various groups filed three <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> lawsuits in 2010; the ruling in Vallejos' case was expected to be a precedent for the other two.|$|E
25|$|Until 1997, British {{nationality}} related {{closely with}} the permanent resident status which guaranteed <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode.</b> Hong Kong permanent residents had British nationality either by birth, naturalisation or by descent. The type of British citizenship connected to Hong Kong eventually evolved to become {{different from that of}} the United Kingdom. What has not changed is the definition that a Hong Kong permanent resident has the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong.|$|E

50|$|Taiwanese {{passport}} {{is one of}} {{the five}} passports with the most improved rating globally since 2006 in terms of number of countries that its holders may visit without a visa. As of 1 January 2017, nationals of Republic <b>of</b> China with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Taiwan had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 134 countries and territories, ranking the ordinary Taiwan passport 31st in terms of travel freedom (tied with Costa Rican and Vatican passports) according to the Henley visa restrictions index. The Taiwanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, however, listed 164 countries with visa-free or visa on arrival access, which included a large number of countries requiring pre-arrival documentations such as invitations or visa approval letters (such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Vietnam). Such countries are not considered as providing visa-free or visa-on-arrival access, since the visa is usually approved before arrival and during the process of obtaining such documentations. The graph below only lists those countries which provide visa-free or visa on arrival without additional documentations prior to travelling as per international-accepted definitions.|$|R
5000|$|Orders in Council were {{controversially}} used in 2004 {{to overturn}} a court ruling in the United Kingdom which {{held that the}} exile of the Chagossians from the British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT) was unlawful. However, the High Court, in 2006, held that these Orders in Council were unlawful, saying [...] "The suggestion that a minister can, through the means of an order in council, exile a whole population from a British Overseas Territory and claim that he is doing so for the 'peace, order and good government' of the territory is to us repugnant." [...] The UK government's appeal failed, with the Court of Appeal holding that the decision had been unlawfully taken by a government minister [...] "acting without any constraint". However the government successfully appealed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords who overturned the High Court and Court of Appeal decisions. The House of Lords decided that the validity of an order in council made under the prerogative legislating for a colony was amenable to judicial review (see paragraph 35 of the decision). Further {{that it was not}} for the courts to substitute their judgement for that of the Secretary of State as to what was conducive to the peace, order and good government of BIOT. Nor were the orders Wednesbury unreasonable on the facts given the considerations of security and cost of resettlement. Further, none of the orders were open to challenge in the British courts on the ground of repugnancy to any fundamental principle relating to the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> <b>of</b> the Chagossians in the Chagos Islands.|$|R

25|$|Another special {{group of}} solely Hong Kong British {{nationals}} were the non-Chinese ethnic minorities of Hong Kong. They are primarily immigrants or {{children of immigrants}} from Nepal, India and Pakistan. After the handover to China, {{they would not be}} accepted as inherently being citizens of the People's Republic. They would be left effectively stateless – they would have British nationality and permanent residency and <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong, but no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in the UK, nor a right to claim Chinese nationality.|$|E

25|$|The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong is {{the right}} to legally reside in Hong Kong without any limit or {{condition}} of stay being imposed by the Hong Kong Immigration Department. As the People's Republic of China stood to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom, the nationality of Hong Kong people as well as their <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in the territory was formalised prior to the 1997 handover. Since Hong Kong has never been an independent country, there is no provision for its own citizenship status. Hong Kong Permanent Resident is the legal status for those who have the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong, which is the de-facto citizenship status in Hong Kong. Most citizen rights in Hong Kong (such as the right to vote) are granted to all permanent residents, while some (such as the right to hold a HKSAR passport, or becoming a high-rank public officer such as the Chief Executive) are restricted to permanent residents who are also Chinese citizens.|$|E

25|$|Finally, {{under the}} Immigration Act, 1971, {{the concept of}} patriality or <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> was created. CUKCs and other Commonwealth {{citizens}} had the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in the UK only if they, their husband (if female), their parents or their grandparents were connected with the United Kingdom. This placed the UK in the rare position of denying some of its nationals entry into their country of nationality. However, the concept of patriality was only a temporary solution to halt a sudden wave of migration. The British government later reformed the law, resulting in the British Nationality Act, 1981.|$|E
25|$|Both {{same-sex}} marriages and civil unions {{of other nations}} will be automatically considered civil partnerships under UK law providing they came within Section 20 of the Act. This means, in some cases, non-Britons from nations with civil unions will have greater rights in the UK than in their native countries. For example, a Vermont civil union would have legal standing in the UK, however in cases where one partner was American and the other British, the Vermont civil union would not provide the Briton with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Vermont (or any other US state or territory), whereas it would provide the American with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in the UK.|$|E

25|$|Many from Hong Kong {{had moved}} to {{mainland}} China and started families. Under the immigration law prior to 1 July 1997, their children born in mainland China had no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong. After the Basic Law came into effect, the government of Hong Kong realised that Article 24(2)(3) would have allowed thousands of children in mainland China, who previously had no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode</b> in Hong Kong, to immigrate to Hong Kong. Many children who had already illegally come to Hong Kong or overstayed their visas presented themselves to immigration authorities and claimed that they were entitled to stay in Hong Kong under Article 24(2)(3).|$|E
25|$|The {{definition}} of Hong Kong permanent residents {{is listed in}} Article 24 of the Basic Law, under which this class of persons enjoy the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>abode.</b> However, the conflict between this Article and Article 22 led to extensive controversies and litigations.|$|E
