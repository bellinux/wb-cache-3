50|$|There {{are four}} major {{disciplines}} within dental technology. These are fixed prosthesis including crowns, bridges and implants; <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> including dentures and removable partial dentures; maxillofacial prosthesis, including ocular prosthesis and craniofacial prosthesis; and orthodontics and auxiliaries, including orthodontic appliances and mouthguards.|$|E
5000|$|In {{secondary}} occlusal trauma, simply {{removing the}} [...] "high spots" [...] or selective grinding of the teeth will not eliminate the problem, because the teeth are already periodontally involved. After splinting the teeth {{to eliminate the}} mobility, {{the cause of the}} mobility (in other words, the loss of clinical attachment and bone) must be managed; this is achieved through surgical periodontal procedures such as soft tissue and bone grafts, as well as restoration of edentulous areas. As with primary occlusal trauma, treatment may include either a <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> or implant-supported crown or bridge.|$|E
50|$|In primary occlusal trauma, the cause, of the {{mobility}} was the excessive force being {{applied to a}} tooth with a normal attachment apparatus, otherwise known as a periodontally-uninvolved tooth. The approach should be to eliminate {{the cause of the}} pain and mobility by determining the causes and removing them; the mobile tooth or teeth will soon cease exhibiting mobility. This could involve removing a high spot on a recently restored tooth, or even a high spot on a non-recently restored tooth that perhaps moved into hyperocclusion. It could also involved altering one's parafunctional habits, such as refraining from chewing on pens or biting one's fingernails. For a bruxer, treatment of the patient's primary occlusal trauma could involve selective grinding of certain interarch tooth contacts or perhaps employing a nightguard to protect the teeth from the greater than normal occlusal forces of the patient's parafunctional habit. For someone who is missing enough teeth in non-strategic positions so that the remaining teeth are forced to endure a greater per square inch occlusal force, treatment might include restoration with either a <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> or implant-supported crown or bridge.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} objectively and subjectively the oral health of elders with Parkinson's disease (PD), using clinical oral assessments and the General Oral Health Assessment Index (GOHAI). Subjects included 37 <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> wearers, 17 with PD (mean age 69. 59 ± 5. 09 years) and 20 without PD (mean age 72. 00 ± 5. 69 years). The objective assessment included {{an evaluation of}} oral characteristics, including the number of remaining teeth, decayed, missing and filled teeth (DMFT), visible plaque index (VPI), salivary flow rate and <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> conditions. The subjective assessment included self-perception of oral health collected using the GOHAI index. The number of remaining teeth, DMFT, VPI, salivary flow rate and GOHAI data were compared between the groups using t-tests. <b>Removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> conditions were analyzed using &# 967; 2 tests (p 0. 05). Greater maxillary prosthesis defects were observed {{in the control group}} (p= 0. 037). GOHAI scores were low for the PD group and moderate for controls, yielding a group difference (p= 0. 04). In conclusion, elders with PD have similar oral health to controls. Although all elders had few remaining teeth, high DMFT and high VPI, PD elders had more negative self-perceptions of their oral health than did the controls...|$|E
40|$|To {{understand}} {{the impact of}} oral rehabilitation of patients treated for head and neck cancer, it would be beneficial to describe the patient-reported problems related to fixed and <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> with and without implants and which impairments are improved by the treatment. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the impact of oral rehabilitation with fixed versus <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> with and without implants on Oral Health Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) measured with OHIP- 49 for patients treated with radiation therapy and/or ablative surgery. The study cohort included 51 patients (35 males, 16 females) with a mean age of 66 years. A significant improvement in OHRQoL was demonstrated after oral rehabilitation with fixed and <b>removable</b> dental <b>prosthesis</b> for patients after radiation and/or ablative jaw surgery. Thirty-nine of the 43 patients improved oral health related quality of life after prosthetic rehabilitation. Twenty-four patients improved with more than 20 points. The oral rehabilitation resulted in better appearance and chewing function. No significant effect between fixed versus <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> and no significant effect of implant on the OHIP-score. This may be explained by a limited sample size, a great variation between the included patients and the validity of the OHIP- 49 questionnaire measure to demonstrate patient-reported improvements or deterioration of a prosthetic treatment in this group of very functional compromised patients...|$|R
30|$|Patients with H&N cancer often undergo {{ablative}} surgery with {{or without}} surgical reconstruction, radiotherapy and chemotherapy [4, 6]. Both surgical and non-surgical interventions can lead to significant disability, including facial deformity, loss of hard and soft tissue, impaired speech, swallowing and mastication [7]. Oral and dental rehabilitation has conventionally required the use of <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> to obturate defects, to replace missing tissue structures and to restore function and aesthetics. In this patient group, <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> are often poorly tolerated, are difficult for the patient to maintain and frequently fail to fully achieve the intended functional improvement. The use of dental implants has been proposed to enable secure anchorage for prostheses, reduced loading on vulnerable tissues and provide a better functional and cosmetic solution [8].|$|R
40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} Medicare rebate claim trends under the Australian Chronic Disease Dental Scheme (CDDS) over time, region and type of service. Methods: CDDS data obtained from the Department of Human Services reflected all Medicare item claims lodged under the CDDS by dental practitioners and processed by Medicare. Retrospective analysis of CDDS rebate claims was conducted. Results: The CDDS rebates for the period 2008 – 13 totalled A$ 2. 8 billion. Just under 81 % of claims were from dental practitioners working in major cities. The most frequent rebates were for crown, bridge and implant (32. 4 %), <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> (22. 4 %) and restorative services (21. 3 %). The rebate claims of restorative services, crown and bridge, and <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> per dentist in all regional areas increased over the time of the CDDS. Per capita, the rebates for every type of dental service were lower in the more remote regions. Conclusions: Rebate claims increased in each of the last 3 full years of the CDDS across all areas. The majority of Medicare rebate claims were from major city areas and for crown and bridge, <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> and restorative services. The service mix varied between regions.

40|$|Abstract Aim: To {{compare the}} {{masticatory}} performance associated with different rehabilitation strategies {{for patients with}} edentulous mandibles. Methods: one portion of the test food "Optocal" was provided to groups: Natural Dentition (n = 15), Mandibular Fixed Implant-Supported Prosthesis with Maxillary Fixed Prosthesis (n = 8), Mandibular Fixed Implant-Supported Prosthesis with Maxillary <b>Removable</b> <b>Prosthesis</b> (n = 14), Mandibular Implant-Retained Overdenture with Maxillary <b>Removable</b> <b>Prosthesis</b> (n = 16), and Complete Dentures (n = 16). The portion was collected after 40 chewing strokes, and then passed through a stack of eight sieves with decreasing apertures. Masticatory performance was determined by weighing the portion of food on each sieve. Results: the masticatory performance was: 71. 00 % for Natural Dentition, 41. 57 % for Mandibular Fixed Implant-Supported Prosthesis with Maxillary Fixed Prosthesis, 31. 44 % for Mandibular Fixed Implant-Supported Prosthesis with Maxillary <b>Removable</b> <b>Prosthesis,</b> 27. 70 % for Mandibular Implant-retained Overdenture, and 14. 33 % for Complete Dentures.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{controlled}} {{study was to determine}} the impact of a single-tooth implant, fixed implant prosthesis and completely removable dental prosthesis on intelligibility, articulation and oromyofunctional behaviour. Additionally, the self-perceived overall satisfaction of the dental replacements and the effect on speech was questioned. Objective (acoustic analysis) as well as subjective assessment techniques (perceptual evaluation) were used. The satisfaction of single-tooth implant group was very high (100 %) followed by a satisfaction of 87 % for the fixed implant prosthesis group and 68 % for the <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> group. The results of the phonetic analyses revealed a normal intelligibility and oromyofunctional behaviour in the three groups of dental replacements. Only one type of articulation disorders was observed in the single-tooth implant group, followed by three types of disorders in the <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> group and six types of disorders in the fixed implant prosthesis group. In this last group, not only 87 % of the subjects showed distortions of one or more consonants but also most consonants of the Dutch language were disturbed in comparison with the single-tooth implant and <b>removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> users.

40|$|AIM: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate patient satisfaction with <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> and its relationship with denture quality. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty-seven patients who received 119 new <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> over a period of one year at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University, were recalled for an interview with regard to their satisfaction with their dentures and a clinical examination. Prosthetic quality was determined using the California Dental Association criteria. RESULTS: Results showed 75 % and 66 % of upper and lower dentures, respectively, were reported by patients as satisfactory. Of all the upper prostheses rated as being of acceptable quality, 94 % were also reported by patients as satisfactory, but of those of unacceptable quality, only 52 % were reported by patients as unsatisfactory. The corresponding figures for lower dentures were 91 % and 71 %, respectively. No significant associations were found between patient satisfaction and age, or denture experience. CONCLUSION: Although acceptable quality of <b>removable</b> <b>prostheses</b> usually resulted in patient satisfaction, the finding that some patients were satisfied with their prostheses despite unacceptable quality suggests other factors besides quality affect outcomes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Numerous {{studies have}} been {{published}} about the prosthetic rehabilitation of the postoncological maxillo-facial patient, but the guidelines that emerge lack a correlation between the anatomical classification of the treated site, which generally is preparatory upon surgery, {{and the type of}} prosthetic rehabilitation appropriate to the new anatomical and functional condition. With this correlation, {{it would be possible to}} obtain a multidisciplinary and predictable therapeutic process, able to identify from the beginning the best type of prosthetic rehabilitation. METHODS: The authors analyzed a sample of 78 patients treated in the Maxillofacial Surgery Unit of "Sapienza" University of Rome for a tumor of the head and neck area, and at a later stage prosthetically rehabilitated in the years from 2010 to 2013 in the Prosthetic Rehabilitation Unit of the same University because of the consequences of the ablative surgery. After having analyzed data concerning the treatment of the maxillofacial tumor, Authors classified the kind of prosthetic rehabilitation. <b>Removable</b> <b>prosthesis</b> was chosen in 18 cases, while implant (or teeth) -supported rehabilitation was performed in 60 cases. RESULTS: Authors correlated the kind of surgical reconstruction to the prosthetic rehabilitation performed.

40|$|Statement {{of problem}} When {{implants}} {{are incorporated into}} an existing partial <b>removable</b> dental <b>prosthesis,</b> the acrylic resin base can fracture. It is therefore essential to study the mechanical behavior of partial <b>removable</b> dental <b>prostheses</b> by using stress and deformation analysis Purpose The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the effect of the occlusal rest position on the implant-assisted partial <b>removable</b> dental <b>prosthesis</b> by finite element analysis. Material and methods A Faro Arm scan was used to extract the geometrical data of a human partially edentulous mandible. A standard plus regular neck (4. 8 × 12 mm) implant and titanium matrix, tooth roots, and periodontal ligaments were modeled by using a combination of reverse engineering in Rapidform XOR 2 and solid modeling with the Solid Works CAD program. The model incorporated a partial <b>removable</b> dental <b>prosthesis</b> and was loaded with standard bilateral forces. A uniform pressure was applied on the occlusal surface so as to generate an equivalent net force of 120 N for both the left and right prosthesis. The finite element analysis program ANSYS Workbench was used to analyze the stress and strain distributions in the implant-assisted partial <b>removable</b> dental <b>prosthesis.</b> Results Maximum stresses were significantly high for the metal framework compared to the acrylic resin surface, and these stresses were different for the mesial and distal arm designs. The maximum stress in the metal framework for the mesial arm design was 614. 9 MPa, and it was 796. 4 MPa for the distal arm design. The corresponding stresses in the acrylic resin surface were 10. 6 and 8. 6 MPa.
