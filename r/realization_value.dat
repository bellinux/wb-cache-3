40|$|The {{aim of the}} article. Methodological {{bases and}} {{developed}} methodical ensuring management of restructuring of production systems in the conditions of uncertainty are developed. Factors of external and internal environment in case of production are considered oriented to the western markets. There is a model and intellectual system of decision support developed which in difference from existing, allows to plan demand, to perform the schedule of release of concentrate {{and is able to}} plan energy consumption, material resources and production capacities. It allows to provide monitoring of the internal environment for the purpose of minimization of idle time of the equipment and duration of a production cycle of concentrate. The results of the analysis. Optimization of the product demand by steel works of EU countries is executed by means of use of the balanced scorecard. On its basis minimization of operating costs, maximizations of economic profit are reached. It allows to raise products competitiveness the entities of MMC taking into account use of basic provisions of a series of international standards of quality management and safety of supply chains. By monitoring of lifecycles of production and time management of transition processes in system of technological devices of production of concentrate and pellets the minimization of expenses of the electric power, water and heat is reached. Due to decrease in the cost level increase of a gross income from sale of innovative products (super concentrate), cost efficiency and market value of the entity is reached. Management of the balanced indicators and an assessment in real time of the cash flows arriving on an entrance of the entity is provided with risk management system and a subsystem of innovative and investment project management. It allows to estimate <b>realization</b> <b>value</b> of anti-risk actions for prevention and decrease in probability of failure to carry out of an order portfolio of steel works of EU countries. The system of automation of acceptance of management decisions with intellectual search engines and decision making maintenance which considers features of technological structure of the entity, uncertainty of external and internal factors of production of innovative products is offered. It allows by means of subsystems of resource planning (ERP), production management (MES), information support about business – the SAPR/ 3, CRM, SRM, PLM applications to identify and analyze production situations during accomplishment of a portfolio of the order of the countries of ERU conditions of a capacity limitation of power supply systems. The DSS system as an alternative control technique developed by authors of article the entity in the conditions of the crisis phenomena of 2015 - 2016 can be offered top managers of PJSC Metinvest Group as implementation of the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) technology for minimization of operating costs, work of the entities of MMC during the periods of a capacity limitation of the electrical system and management of adaptation of products of public joint stock company to requirements of standards of EU countries. Conclusions and directions of further researches. It is proved that restructuring of production processes of enrichment and operational development of concentrate to the level of requirements of steel works of EU countries has increased the cost of the entities of mining and metallurgical complex in 2015 by 0, 5...|$|E

At first, the aim was to research the psychopathological profile of adolescents, with sociodemographic variables. Further on Competence, Coping and Values were added for an approach from the Positive Psychology (Dahlsgaard, Peterson & Seligman, 2005).   This article presents the preliminar results of a youth sample of secondary level students (n= 152), aged 12 to 18, male and female, belonging to a medium socioeconomical status. The instrument used for the study is the Basic Values Questionnaire, developed by Valdiney V. Gouveia (1998), based on the studies of S. Schwartz and W. Bilsky (1987, 1990, 2004). Once the performance of this instrument was tested with our Spanish speaking population, some linguistic adaptations were implemented. To obtain the profile of the interviewed adolescents, descriptive statistic is used. The results show to statistically significant difference between girls and boys in Experimenting and <b>Realization</b> <b>Values</b> (Personnel Values Group); as well in Existence (Central Category Value) and in Normative (Social Value), with bigger M quantity in Suprapersonnel Value (Central Value) and Interaction (Social Category Value). In response to open questions about the most and the least important values, subjects have chosen Interaction (Social Value) and Existence Values (Central Value) as the most important ones, and <b>Realization</b> <b>Values</b> (Personal Value) and the Normative Values (Central Value Category), as the least important ones. The study shows the importance of some groups of Values, what would require an analysis in relation to the behaviours with those that are expressed and their cultural relevance.

40|$|It is {{possible}} to suppose that the peculiarities of perception of sociocultural circumstances of the town environment by boys and girls may {{be connected to the}} specific features, which are included into the structure of the personal potential. To reveal this connection psychological research of the student youth living in two Siberian cities (Tomsk and Lesosibirsk), which have quite a lot of differences in social and economic spheres has been done. The students of senior courses, Masters and postgraduates (163 people in general) who are studying human sciences took part in the research. Subjective evaluation of city circumstances {{from the point of view}} of possibility for <b>realization</b> of basic <b>values</b> was received by the means of technique called «Subjective evaluation of basic values realization» (by S. A. Bogomaz). The received results show that the personal traits of modern young people studying human sciences in a large extent define the way they perceive and estimate sociocultural conditions of the city. There are common and specific characteristics of estimation in both Siberian cities. Thus, from the point of view of the student youth, both cities Tomsk and Lesosibirsk in a large extent may provide the realization of the need for a search of a life partner and making family. But the same conditions in a lesser degree may provide the <b>realization</b> of the <b>value</b> of «becoming famous and popular». At the same time human-oriented student youth from Tomsk is sure that their city allows to reach success in a chosen profession, but young people from Lesosibirsk do not consider their town to be the right environment for the realization of this opportunity. And what is more, those who show obstinate efforts in reaching the goals incline to the negative evaluation of the possibility of <b>realization</b> such basic <b>values</b> as «to be healthy» and «to feel safe» in Lesosibirsk. In our opinion, the received results show that the more human-oriented student youth reveal such personal traits as purposefulness, rationality, reflexivity, inclination to self-determination, satisfaction with life, and value orientations such as «serving to people», «business activity», «challenge», «freedom for», the more positive they evaluate the possibility of <b>realization</b> of basic <b>values</b> and sociocultural conditions of the city environment. The above said in its turn may determine their positive perception of the city environment potential as the environment of possibilities, the environment for the professional and personal development, the environment for the <b>realization</b> of their <b>values</b> and goals. But if the level of development of the above listed personal traits and value orientations is low, it may lead to the negative evaluation of possibilities of <b>realization</b> of basic <b>values</b> in the same city environment by both boys and girls. Besides original evaluation of possibilities of <b>realization</b> of basic <b>values</b> might be seen in case the boys and girls have the orientation to the «freedom from».   DOI:  [URL] </p...|$|R
