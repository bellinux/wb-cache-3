First, this study adopted community identification as antecedents of post-purchase. Other relational variables, such as brand community commitment, could also be considered and examined as antecedents. Second, our sample comprised primarily young adults (under 30  years old); hence, their responses may not be completely generalizable to the population at large. Thirdly, although the web survey could avoid the <b>regional</b> <b>limitation,</b> the questionnaire in Chinese could limit this study in the Chinese region. Future research could try to translate the questionnaire into English in order to reach more participants from different regions. Finally, this study examined digital customer participation on a specific form of social media based brand community, namely Facebook, so the results could not be ascribed to other formats of internet-based platform. Future researchers could explore consumers’ online engagement with regard to different types of e-commerce or m-commerce applications with specific brand or product settings. In the context of other format of internet-based platform, there are so many social networking sites, and virtual communities, stated by eBizMBA Inc. [90]; and the research also listed top 15 most popular social networking sites ranked by Alexa Global Traffic Rank. Moreover, Instagram is the fastest-growing social media site globally, mentioned by Lunden [91]. Therefore, for the further research, the author suggested which could extend the research from Instagram user communities.|$|E

But this study is very important to gain clear knowledge about the developing process of English agriculture. Under the consideration of it, author divides English agriculture between 18 th and 19 th centruies into the following three periods from the viewpoint of the degree of the development of Mixed Husbandry. I. Early Period of the Development of Mixed Husbandry: the stage of Norfolk Husbandry having certain peculiarity and <b>regional</b> <b>limitation</b> at Agricultural Revelution Period. II. Period of Mixed Husbandry: the stage that the Mixed Husbandry extends to the whole of England and develops more highly under the Period of High Farming. III. Period of the Re-arrangement of Mixed Husbandry: the stage that the Mixed Husbandry is chiefly changed to Animal Husbandry at the Great Depression Period. And, then, author makes clear the economic and technical factors for developming from Early Period to Mixed Husbandry Period. In addition to this, author studies the relation between purchased fertilizer and the development of Mixed Husbandry. In the present paper (Study I), author examines the reason why Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period is placed as Early Period of the Development of Mixed Husbandry through the examination of the useful literature as books written by Marshall, Kent and Young. With the advance of Industrial Revolution, the increase of wheat production is demanded, and Norfolk Husbandry becomes to be greatly noticed in England. For Norfolk Husbandry has the scientific rotation including turnip and clover in its system and has mutual relation between livestock enterprise and arable enterprise, so that higher crop is produced. However, that it is the Husbandry having certain peculiarity and <b>regional</b> <b>limitation,</b> author concludes from the following reasens; that is, i) the existence of Norfolk light soil easy for introducing turnip, and Early Enclosure and Early Development of large sized farm based of the system of field peculiar to East Anglia couties, ii) that turnip is cultivated by broadcasting and hand hoeing, and by cheaper skillful labourers than other counties, and iii) that many of the livestocks feeded is not superior breeds, but natives, the feeding method of them is not completely changed to stall-feeding in Norfolk, and the demand for animal foods rather decrease for higher price of wheat at Agricultural Revolution Period. Accordingly, though it is generally said that extended reproduction function that contains 2 ̆ 2 introduction of turnip and clover→increase of livestock productivity→increase of dung→increase of arable productivity 2 ̆ 2 characterizes the nature of Norfolk Husbandry, author concludes that it exists in Early Period of the Development of Mixed Husbandry. 本論では農業革命以後の,とくに穀物法撤廃以後のハイ･ファーミング期における混合農業(Mixed Husbandry) の展開を考察の対象にする. このばあい,混合農業とは岩片(1951) によると, 2 ̆ 2 穀物関税の廃止以後,実質賃銀が高まっていくにつれて,畜産食糧に対する需要が旺盛になったことは, 19 世紀の中葉までに輸栽式をいよいよ一般的ならしめたのであって,この経営方式は 19 世紀の 70 年代に最高潮に達したわけである. 英国で一般に混合農業(原文では混同農業である…筆者注) と呼ばれるこの方式は,経営に対しては穀物と養畜との収益のバランスのうえに成立した 2 ̆ 2 (岩片, 1951, 14 - 15 貢). その他の識者による混合農業の規定をみると, 2 ̆ 2 穀物と畜産との結合 2 ̆ 2,あるいは 2 ̆ 2 耕地と牧草地との結合 2 ̆ 2 (Levy, 1966,p. 59), 2 ̆ 2 ノーフォーク方式の原型に緬羊や肉牛などの肥育をバランスよく結合させた農法 2 ̆ 2 (小林, 1973, 59 頁), 2 ̆ 2 穀物と緬羊か牛かいずれか, あるいは双方の飼養を組合わせる方式, つまり,飼料作物と穀作物との輪作,耕地緬羊(arable herds) と畜舎内牛(yard-feeding cattle) を飼養するノーフォーク 4 圃輪栽式 2 ̆ 2 (Jones, 1962,p. 109) 等である. したがって,本論では混合農業をハイ･ファーミング期における経済的･技術的条件のもとで,別種部門と畜産部門とが補合･補完的に結合し,しかも穀物と家畜とが収益的にバランスよく結合した農業と理解する...|$|E

The literatures used here are 2 ̆ 2 British Farming 2 ̆ 2 written by Wilson and country reports of agriculture in the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England. The conclusion gained is the followings: that is; With the rises of corn- and livestock-prices and improvement of a means of communication such as the extention of railway under the economic prosperity at Victorian Era, in arable enterprise, drill-husbandry that consists of deep-plough, drill-plough and hoe-plough degelops, more fertilization is fostered by uses of purchased fertilizer and good, more dung, and land improvements by which it improves heavy soil and marsh lands are brought. As the result, alternative system of corn crops and fodder crops is general, and its crop very increases. The other hand, in livestock enterprise, with introduction of superior breeds of cattle and sheep such as Shorthorn, Hereford, Improved Leicester and Southdown and so on, -as for the process of improving breeds of livestock, as the supplementary section of this chapter, author examines the process of improving Jersey cattle that is one of Channel Island Breeds, as a case-, the improvement and evolution of the feeding methods of livestock that contains the advance of stall-feeding, more uses of turnip, grasses and purchased feed, and establishment of machines (of steam-engine) and implements of cooking those feed, is brought, consequently, livestok is increased both in quantity and quality. In short, under the Period of High Farming, Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period can extend to the whole of England and realise higher productivity under the following economic and technical factors: that is; (i) the development of drill husbandry, and the progresses of more fertilization and land improvements, (ii) introduction of livestocks of superior breed, and the improvement and evolution of the feeding methods of livestock, and (iii) improvement of the price condition of corn and livestock and the development of means of communication which aspire those technical progress. 前稿では農業革命期におけるノーフォーク農業に関する最重要文献であるMarshall, Youngのノーフォーク州農業調査報告に依拠して,ノーフォーク農業が混合農業の発展前期である理由,別の言葉でいうと,ノーフォーク農業は一定の特殊性と地域的限定性をもつ農業であることを考察した. そして,このノーフォーク農業が 19 世紀中葉ハイ・ファーミング期にイギリス全域に普及し,より高い生産力を複合経営組織を通して発現するためには,経済的諸条件の変化とそれに呼応した技術条件の整備が重要であることを指摘した. そこで,本稿では,混合農業発展前期から混合農業熙にいたる経済的・技術的展開条件について考察を試みることにする. このばあい,当時の 2 ̆ 2 王立農業協会誌(The Jounal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England) 2 ̆ 2 に掲載された各州農業に関する懸賞論文(prize essay; prize report) ―以下, 2 ̆ 2 協会誌 2 ̆ 2 農業報告と呼称する―,およびWilson(1862) を主な資料とするが,資料の性質上本稿では技術条件を中心にして考察をすすめることにする...|$|E

To avoid the depletion of natural living resources in the ocean, the request cannot be supplied from capture fisheries alone, but must also be supported by aquaculture products. Due to <b>regional</b> <b>limitation</b> inland, aquaculture in the seas, or mariculture, had been introduced {{as an alternative to}} inland aquaculture by utilization of coastal and offshore areas. Over the last two-decades, mariculture has been intensified and has created essential employment opportunities. This development has also augmented environmental concerns and questions about possible environmental impacts. Intensive fish farming releases considerable amounts of nutrient waste in dissolved and particulate form into the environment through feed excess, soluble fish excretion and faeces production. It is important before the implementation of fish farming mariculture activities, appropriate site conditions for culturing the species should be selected in order to minimize environmental impacts arising from the farming activities (sustainability) as well as to guarantee adequate conditions from the operational point of view (suitability). This study focuses on the development of a Decision Support System (DSS) as a tool for the decision maker in coastal zone management and mariculture for the appropriate selection of mariculture site location. Extensive use of GIS as part of the Decision Support System was deployed in this study. The DSS is based on physical, chemical and sediment criteria as well as on data of conflicting coastal use. The GIS analysis results in a map indicating the suitable areas for the improved method of offshore cage mariculture. In this study, emphasis was placed on finfish species, however the methods and results may be employed for other species as well following some modifications. The DSS was applied for the Seribu Islands area in the Java Sea and the Riau Archipelago, Indonesia.

Because as in Chapter II, the factors affecting the development of Mixed Husbandry is examined England as a whole, Chapter III aims to point out its characteristics at the stage of individual farm management. Chapter IV supplements this study, for one of the characteristics of the agriculture under the Period of High Farming is more uses of purchased fertilizer than previous periods, and so in this case, it is very important what more uses of purchased fertilizer effect on the system of English farming. Though author feels sorry not to sum shortly those contents here, he remarks some points to be cleared through this study. Author places Norfolk Husbandry as Early Priod of the Development of Mixed Husbandry for the reason why Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period is one of having certain peculiarity and <b>regional</b> <b>limitation,</b> and then, the factors that it extends to the whole of England and realizes higher productivity under the Period of High Farming is (i) in arable enterprise, the development of drill husbandry, more fertilization (by means of more dung and purchased fertilizer), and the evolution of land improvements (by pipe-draining and the mixing the soil), (ii) in livestock enterprise, the introduction of livestocks of superior breed as Shorthorn and Southdown and so on, and the improvement and development of the feeding methods of livestock (the evolution of stall-feeding, more uses of turnip, grasses and purchased feed such as oil-cake and linseed-cake, the establishment of the machines and implements of cooking those feed, and the erection of liquid manure tank), (iii) the rese of prices of corn and livestock, and the degelopment of means of communication which aspire those technical progress. Accordingly, under the presence of above mentioned economic and technical factors under the Period of High Farming, the extended reproduction function that contains 2 ̆ 2 introduction of turnip and clover→increase of livestock productivity→increase of dung→increase of arable productivity 2 ̆ 2 which is generally pointed as a characteristics attended to Norfolk Husbandry at Agricultural Revolution Period, is more completely, more extensively realized. 前稿においてはイギリス農業全体として混合農業の展開条件を考察したのであるが,本章では個別経営の段階における混合農業の経営・技術的特性を検討する. 個別経営事例の検討によって,その特性がより明確に浮きでると考えるからである. このばあい,Caird (1852) の 2 ̆ 2 English Agriculture in 1850 - 512 ̆ 2 を主要資料とする.

H 577 P BSE 2016 Chenxxvii, 238 pages :color illustrationsIndirect {{evaporative}} cooler (IEC) which uses water evaporation to produce cooling air without adding extra moisture {{has become increasingly}} attractive as a natural cooling technology. It {{has a number of}} advantages over the traditional mechanical vapor compression refrigeration (MVCR) system such as energy efficiency, environmental friendly, low energy consumption and easy maintenance. The IEC is widely used in hot and dry regions because larger cooling capacity can be achieved with low air humidity. In hot and humid regions, the IEC application is restricted to the high humidity in the past. In recent decant, however, the hybrid IEC and mechanical cooling system (also called IEC energy recovery system) has been proposed to break the <b>regional</b> <b>limitation</b> of IEC application and attracts great research interest for its high energy saving potential. In this hybrid system, IEC is used as an energy recovery device installed before an AHU or cooling coil in an air-conditioning system. The exhausted air from air-conditioned space is used as secondary air. Although IEC is being extensively used and related experimental and simulation research work has been carried out, current efforts focus on evaluating the performance in dry and moderate regions, where it was initially used. Little previous studies involving the modeling of IEC in hot and humid regions can be identified. Furthermore, no experimental study on evaluating IEC performance in humid regions can be found in open literatures. In dry or moderate regions, there would be no condensation from primary air, so it is understandable that only sensible cooling performance is discussed in previous studies. However, owing to the high humidity of fresh air in humid areas, condensation would occur on the primary air side. The heat and mass transfer process is much more complicated in this case compared with that of dry region cases. The condensation would greatly affect the overall performance of IEC, not only in sensible cooling but also newly brought latent cooling. The lack of modeling and experimental research of IEC with condensation provides obstacle for applying IEC energy recovery system in humid regions. Therefore, a programmed research work on modeling and experimental investigation of IEC, with an emphasis on IEC performances with condensation from high humidity primary air, has been carried out in this thesis. This thesis begins with establishing a short-cut analytical model for IEC considering condensation. The models for IEC under non-condensation, total condensation and partial condensation states were established and a method for judging the three states was proposed. The availability of the simplified IEC model would help facilitate annual performance prediction of IEC energy recovery system. Secondly, the thesis presents a novel method for annual simulation of IEC energy recovery system based on the above IEC model. The simulation is achieved by incorporating IEC model into TRNSYS software, so that the annual performance can be precisely predicted by considering possible condensation of IEC, chiller operating state and dynamic cooling load. A detailed case study of a wet market in Hong Kong was presented and the simulation results were validated by a field measurement. The results shows that condensation in IEC takes up a large proportion (47. 7 %) of operation hours in hot and humid regions, especially in summer. Besides, the IEC shows a great potential in energy saving and peak load reduction. Thirdly, the development of a novel numerical IEC model considering condensation and wettability ratio is presented. A comprehensive parameter analysis under three operating states (non-condensation, partial condensation and total condensation) was firstly presented. The results show that the condensation lowers the wet-bulb efficiency, but improves the total heat transfer rate. Besides, the increase of secondary air velocity, decrease of channel gap and improvement of wettability under condensation state improves IEC cooling performance more effectively than in non-condensation state. Fourthly, the parameter sensitivity analysis of IEC by orthogonal test is presented based on the above numerical model. The influence rank of seven parameters was obtained under IEC condensation state. The optimization was conducted to the most influential parameters: channel gap and cooler height. The optimal channel gap is 2 - 3 mm and 3 - 4 mm under condensation and non-condensation state, respectively, while the optimal NTUp is 4 - 7 and 3 - 5, respectively. Finally, experimental study is conducted to evaluate the plate type air cooler performance under four operating modes. Under dry operating mode, the air cooler serves as a traditional air cooler, while under wet operating mode, it works as an IEC. Comparisons can be made between traditional air cooler and IEC under both non-condensation and condensation conditions. The cooler dynamic performance during different operating mode transition and steady performance under different parameter influence were investigated. The results shows condensation weakens sensible heat transfer but improves total heat transfer. The wet operating benefits both the sensible and latent heat transfer rates. The COP varies in a wide range under different operating mode and the highest COP achieved by IEC is 9. 0. Department of Building Services EngineeringPh.

We highlight some of the unique aspects, and highlight the dire safety and efficiency challenges that the sector faces. Mindful of the <b>regional</b> <b>limitations,</b> we introduce and discuss novel ITS solutions, which can be used to address these challenges. We also share some of the initial results observed through initial experimentation with one of the solutions. Post-prin...|$|R
40|$|Hepatocellular {{carcinoma}} (h c c) is {{an uncommon}} tumour, but its incidence is increasing in Canada and elsewhere. Currently, {{there are no}} Canadian recommendations for {{diagnosis and treatment of}} h c c, and possible options may have <b>regional</b> <b>limitations.</b> A consensus symposium was held in the Ottawa region to consider current diagnostic and management options for h c c. These recommendations were developed: Diagnosis—with adequate imaging, a biopsy is not required pre-surgery, but is required before the start of systemic therapy; lesions smaller than 1 cm should be followed and not biopsied; repeat biopsies should be core tissue biopsies; magnetic resonance imaging is preferred, but triphasic computed tomography imaging can be useful Resection—recommended for localized h c c Radiofrequency ablation—recommended for unresectable or non-transplantable h c c; should not be performed in the presence of ascites ● Trans-arterial chemoembolization (ta c e) — doxorubicin with lipiodol is the agent of choice; trans-catheter embolization is an alternative for patients if ta c e is not tolerated or is contraindicated Medical management—first-line sorafenib should be considered the standard of care Transplantation—suitable patients meeting Milan criteria should be assessed for a graft regardless of other treatments offered The authors feel that the recommendations from this consensus symposium may be of interest to other regions in Canada...|$|R

The initiative lost steam in early 1965 after it was disclosed that the U.S. had been indirectly supplying weapons to Israel via West Germany since 1962, {{under the terms of}} a 1960 secret agreement to supply Israel with $80 million worth of armaments. The remainder of the agreement was fulfilled publicly, following its disclosure by the U.S., with Israel receiving shipments of M48 Patton tanks in 1965 and A-4E Skyhawk attack aircraft in 1968.|$|R
40|$|Important {{linkages}} between farm management variables, soil loss, crop yields, and incentives to practice soil conservation {{have often been}} omitted from previous empirical studies, due to <b>regional</b> data <b>limitations</b> and incomplete knowledge of soil loss/crop yiled relationships. An optimal control model is developed with explicit attention to interactions between management choices, soil loss, and long-term farmland productivity. Analysis of the optimality conditions generates a number of hypotheses related to farmers' productivity-linked conservation incentives, which can be tested empirically without precise knowledge of specific erosion-productivity relationships.

40|$|At {{the time}} of the {{introduction}} of the quota system the structure of dairy production in Germany was rather unfavourable. Since 1993, German policy generally aimed at improving quota mobility. The introduction of transfers without land in 1993 facilitated farm growth and the transfer of resources and production to the better farm managers and to locations best suited for dairy production; however the latter was restricted by the <b>regional</b> <b>limitations</b> of the trading zones. The quota auctions introduced in 2000 significantly improved the transparency of quota markets. Larger regional shifts in production will be enabled by the recent reduction of the number of trading zones. Overall, structural change in dairy production has been strong (halving the number of dairy farms every ten years) despite the limitations by the quota system. Still many regions in Germany, notably the case study region of Bavaria, are characterised by small farm structure, where the main share of milk production is still realised by small and medium sized farms. [...] Zur Zeit der Einführung des Quotensystems war die Struktur der Milchproduktion in Deutschland eher ungünstig. Durch die anfängliche strikte Flächenbindung der Quote wurden strukturelle Anpassungen behindert. Die Einführung des Quotentransfers ohne Land im Jahr 1993 erleichterte betriebliches Wachstum und die Verlagerung der Quote zu den besten Wirten und Standorten (innerhalb der Übertragungsgebiete). Mit der 2000 eingeführten Übertragung über Börsen wurde die Flächbindung aufgehoben und eine bessere Transparenz auf dem Quotenmarkt erreicht. Größere regionale Verlagerungen der Milcherzeugung ergeben sich seit Verringerung der Anzahl der Handelszonen seit 2007. Trotz der Beschränkungen durch das Quotensystem ist der Strukturwandel stark ausgeprägt mit einer annähernden Halbierung der Zahl der Milcherzeuger im Zehnjahreszeitraum.

40|$|Model-based {{analysis}} tools, {{built on}} assumptions and simplifications, {{are difficult to}} handle smart grids with data characterized by 4 Vs data. This paper, using random matrix theory (RMT), motivates data-driven tools to perceive the complex grids in highdimension; meanwhile, an architecture with detailed procedures is proposed. In algorithm perspective, the architecture performs a high-dimensional analysis, and compares the findings with RMT predictions to conduct anomaly detections. Mean Spectral Radius (MSR), as a statistical indicator, is defined to reflect the correlations of system data in different dimensions. In management mode perspective, a group-work mode is discussed for smart grids operation. This mode breaks through <b>regional</b> <b>limitations</b> for energy flows and data flows, and makes advanced big data analyses possible. For a specific large-scale zone-dividing system with multiple connected utilities, each site, operating under the group-work mode, is able {{to work out the}} regional MSR only with its own measured/simulated data. The large-scale interconnected system, in this way, is naturally decoupled from statistical parameters perspective, rather than from engineering models perspective. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of these distributed MSRs, even with imperceptible different raw data, will produce a contour line to detect the event and locate the source. It demonstrates that the architecture is compatible with the block calculation only using the regional small database; beyond that, this architecture, as a data-driven solution, is sensitive to system situation awareness, and practical for real large-scale interconnected systems. Five case studies and their visualizations validate the designed architecture in various fields of power systems. To our best knowledge, this study is the first attempt to apply big data technology into smart grids. Comment: 13 pages, 14 figures, Accepted by IEEE Trans on Smart Gri...|$|R

The alteration in the hydrological regime is considered as a major factor contributing to the loss of biological diversity and ecological functioning of aquatic ecosystems (Bunn and Arthington 2002; Dale et al. 2016).
