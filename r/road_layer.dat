The compaction technique applied on the subgrade <b>road</b> <b>layer</b> for cohesive soil is by using roller compactor machine (static technique) while the technique that is applied in the laboratory is by dynamic compaction method.

In this study seven (7) types of soil based on plasticity chart were tested in several tests to obtain the important engineering parameter such as density (pd), water content (wc), shear strength (Cu), compaction energy (E) and CBR value of soils.

40|$|ABSTRACT – In these days, {{remotely}} sensed imagery {{has been}} widely used for GIS-T (Geographic Information Systems for Transportation). As for this approach, topological measure and spatial metrics of transportation network structure such as <b>road</b> <b>layer</b> {{can be considered as}} one of important factors in urban transportation analysis. Related to this measure, it is known that the connectivity such as alpha index and gamma index which means degree of network connectivity and complexity on a graph or a circuit, provide useful information for urban transportation planning. As well, shimbel index is one of GIS-based spatial metrics to characterize degree of network concentration. However, the approach using these quantitative indices has not been widely used in the practical level dealing with actual data sets yet. While, as other spatial metrics, circuity terms a concept to represent the difference extent between actual nodes and fully connected nodes in the target analysis zone, and accessibility is used to represent accessibility level in the matrix form by connectivity level between node to node in a zone. In this study, several spatial metrics functions, such as connectivity, accessibility, and circuity, mentioned above were first implemented to extract transportation indices from a graph-based network. In conclusions, new quantitative information to characterize an urban transportation environment in a certain region can be easily obtained and utilized as meaningful indicators related to transportation planning process or urban transportation planning...|$|E
40|$|Numerous raster {{maps are}} {{available}} on the Internet, but the geographic coordinates of the maps are often unknown. In order to determine the precise location of a raster map, we exploit the fact that the layout of the road intersections within a certain area can be used to determine the map's location. In this paper, we describe an approach to automatically extract road intersections from arbitrary raster maps. Identifying the road intersections is di#cult because raster maps typically contain multiple layers that represent roads, buildings, symbols, street names, or even contour lines, and the <b>road</b> <b>layer</b> needs to be automatically separated from other layers before road intersections can be extracted. We combine a variety of image processing and graphics recognition methods to automatically eliminate the other layers and then extract the road intersection points. During the extraction process, we determine the intersection connectivity (i. e., number of roads that meet at an intersection) and the road orientations. This information helps in matching the extracted intersections with intersections from known sources (e. g., vector data or satellite imagery). For the problem of road intersection extraction, we applied the techniques to a set of 48 randomly selected raster maps from various sources and achieved over 90 % precision with over 75 % recall. These results are su#cient to automatically align raster maps with other geographic sources, which makes it possible to determine the precise coverage and scale of the raster maps...|$|E

40|$|In 2010, an {{earthquake}} {{in the city}} of Port-au-Prince, Haiti, happened quite by chance an accident and killed over 300000 people. According to historical data such {{an earthquake}} has not occurred in the area. Unpredictability of earthquakes has necessitated the need for comprehensive mitigation efforts to minimize deaths and injuries. Blocked roads, caused by debris of destroyed buildings, may increase the difficulty of rescue activities. In this case, a damage map, which specifies blocked and unblocked roads, can be definitely helpful for a rescue team. In this paper, a novel method for providing destruction map based on pre-event vector map and high resolution world view II satellite images after earthquake, is presented. For this purpose, firstly in pre-processing step, image quality improvement and co-coordination of image and map are performed. Then, after extraction of texture descriptor from the image after quake and SVM classification, different terrains are detected in the image. Finally, considering the classification results, specifically objects belong to “debris” class, damage analysis are performed to estimate the damage percentage. In this case, in addition to the area objects in the “debris” class their shape should also be counted. The aforementioned process are performed on all the roads in the <b>road</b> <b>layer.</b> In this research, pre-event digital vector map and post-event high resolution satellite image, acquired by Worldview- 2, of the city of Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, were used to evaluate the proposed method.

This study {{presents the results}} of forensic investigation of a deterioration portion of the Parit Sumarto rural road. This road had been selected as represent of most common types of road deterioration found in Batu Pahat vicinity through field survey conducted for month in August, 2006. The deformation occurred at {{the right side of the}} road which located adjacent to the open drain. No deformation seen at the opposed side. The deterioration mechanism hypotheses may due to inadequate layer thicknesses and inappropriate geometry conditions. Extensive field and laboratory testing was conductect to verify the hypotheses. Field investigation was initiated by nondestructive testing (NDT) like ground penetrating radar (GPR) to observe pavement layer thickness and subsurface condition. Mini falling weight deflectometer (MFWD) measure the modulus of the unbound layer and lastly density gauge (DG) for density measurement. Subsequently destructive testing (DT) like dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) for assessment of unbound layer and thickness determination was conducted. Also, coring and trenching to obtain samples for further laboratory tests. Two locations were trench; one at deteriorated section and one were outside the deteriorated location. MFWD results in this study revealed unsatisfactory as they are significant low. Layer thickness determination via GPR, DCP and trenching was at acceptable differences. The data obtained from NDTs, DTs and laboratory were than used in 2 D finite element method (Plaxis) and multilayer elastic analysis (Kenlayer). By using Plaxis in this study, it is found that the root cause of the deformation was inappropriate geometrical design pertaining to road shoulder width. Meanwhile, Kennlayer analysis had shown that apparent differences in <b>road</b> <b>layer</b> thicknesses seem to be a contribution factor in deformation.

40|$|The {{research}} {{portrayed in}} this dissertation aims to derive empirical means of predicting CBR values from index testing parameters and parameters calculated from them (e. g. shrinkage product). The project involved compiling {{a database of}} test results {{for a range of}} rock material types across moist and dry regions in southern Africa. The database was compiled {{in such a way that}} it represents natural gravels sampled (mostly) for construction or rehabilitation of <b>road</b> <b>layer</b> works. The database included a location description, material description, Weinert N-Value, Atterberg Limits, grading analysis and CBR values. In addition to this, the linear shrinkage product, shrinkage product, grading coefficient, grading modulus and dust ratio were calculated and also used in the analyses. All the samples were divided into two groups based on climate, as described by Weinert (1980). The data was then further sub-divided into compaction classes (95 %, 98 % and 100 % Mod AASHTO) and within these compaction classes, each sample was assigned to a rock material group based on the classification proposed by Weinert (1980), but with minor alterations (e. g. further subdivision of pedogenic deposits). A total of 60 groups were created. Data processing was done using grading normalised to 100 % passing the 37, 5 mm screen. In order to limit interdependency resulting from the cumulative grading, the sieve analysis results were converted to percentages retained on each sieve. This was necessary as statistical regressions often rejected datasets due to interdependency among input parameters (such as Atterberg Limits and cumulative grading). Based on the nature of the data, both stepwise linear regressions and Weibull regressions were performed. Though the Weibull regression is more suitable to the data (in theory) the linear regression could not be excluded, due to variable data. In addition, the existing model proposed by Kleyn (1955) which was derived empirically by Stephens (1988) was also retained for the analysis. In an attempt to refine Kleyn s model, the two parameters used by the method (i. e. grading modulus and plasticity index) were used in normal linear regressions in an attempt to adapt the model to specific material (and compaction) groups in the two climatic regions. More than 130 regressions were done for the final analysis (excluding experimental regressions, etc.), after restricting the predicted CBR ranges in an attempt to eliminate the prevailing data trend. The attempt proved futile, though, placing severe restrictions on the derived models. For each of the 60 groups all four methods were tested (i. e. stepwise linear regression, Weibull regression, Kleyn s model and a linear model adapted for each group based on Kleyn s model) and the most suitable model selected. A number of regressions were incomplete due to insufficient data, particularly in the groups associated with dry regions. Results proved poor and are ascribed to data variability rather than test methods. The data variability, in turn, is the result of test methods with poor reproducibility and repeatability. In short, the test methods (the CBR in particular) resulted in inconsistent data and subsequently poor results, making accurate predictions nearly impossible.
