40|$|Abstract: Decision {{making is}} one of the most {{critical}} activities in Intensive Care Units (ICU). Moreover, it is extremely difficult for health professionals to interpret in real time all the available data. In order to improve the decision process, classification models have been developed to predict patient’s <b>readmission</b> <b>in</b> ICU. Knowing the probability of <b>readmission</b> <b>in</b> advance will allow for a more efficient planning of discharge. Consequently, the use of these models results in a lower rates of readmission and a cost reduction, usually associated with premature discharges and unplanned <b>readmissions.</b> <b>In</b> this work was followed a numerical index, called Stability and Workload Index for Transfer (SWIFT). The data used to induce the classification models are from ICU of Centro Hospitalar do Porto, Portugal. The results obtained so far, in terms of accuracy, were very satisfactory (98. 91 %). Those results were achieved through the use of Naïve Bayes technique. The models will allow health professionals to have a better perception on patient’s future condition in the moment of the hospital discharge. Therefore it will be possible to know the probability of a patient being readmitted into the ICU...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: <b>Readmission</b> <b>in</b> the {{intensive}} care unit (ICU) is a significant morbidity index, which has been related to poor patient outcomes Aim: To identify the preoperative and intraoperative risk factors for <b>readmission</b> <b>in</b> the cardiac surgery ICU. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 595 consecutive patients who were admitted to the cardiac surgery ICU of a tertiary hospital of Athens - Greece during the one-year period (September 2011 -September 2012). Data collection was carried out, retrospectively, by the use of a short questionnaire and based on the review of medical and nursing patient records at December 2012. Results: The incidence of ICU readmission was 3. 7 % (22 / 595). Respiratory disorders were the main reason for readmission (45. 4 %). Readmitted patients had a significantly higher in-hospital mortality compared to those requiring no readmission (P < 0. 001). Multivariate analysis revealed that female gender [for males odds ratio (OR) 0. 37, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 15 - 0. 89], high logistic EuroSCORE (OR 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 04), prolonged cardiopulmonary (CPB) duration (OR 1. 01, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 02) and preoperative renal failure (OR 1. 02, 95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 05) were the independent risk factors for readmission to the cardiac surgery ICU. Conclusions: One intraoperative and three preoperative variables are associated strongly with higher probability for ICU readmission. Shorter CPB duration could contribute to lower ICU <b>readmission</b> incidence. <b>In</b> addition, the early identification of high risk patients for <b>readmission</b> <b>in</b> the cardiac surgery ICU could encourage both the more efficient healthcare planning and resources allocation...|$|R

How do factors such as orthopedic specialty, data source, patient insurance, and time of data collection affect the 30 -day readmission rate? What are the causes and risk factors for 30 -day readmissions?A review was first registered with Prospero (CRD 42014010293, 6 / 17 / 2014) and a meta-analysis was performed to assess the current 30 -day <b>readmission</b> rate <b>in</b> orthopedics. Studies published after 2006 were retrieved, and 24 studies met the inclusion criteria. The 30 -day readmission rate was extrapolated from each study along with the orthopedic subspecialty, data source, patient insurance, time of collection, patient demographics, and cause of readmission. A sensitivity analysis was completed on the stratified groups. The overall 30 -day readmission rate across all orthopedics was 5. 4 percent (95 % confidence interval: 4. 8, 6. 0). There {{was no significant difference between}} subspecialties. Studies that retrieved data from a multicenter registry had a lower 30 -day readmission rate than those reporting data from a single hospital or a large national database. Patient populations that only included Medicare patients had a higher 30 -day readmission rate than populations of all insurance. The 30 -day readmission rate has decreased in the past ten years. Age, length of stay, discharge to skilled nursing facility, increased BMI, ASA score greater than 3, and Medicare/Medicaid insurance showed statistically positive correlation with increased 30 -day <b>readmissions</b> <b>in</b> greater than 75 percent of studies.

Their families were contacted by telephone and interviews were conducted at 1, 2, 6 and 12 months post-discharge to evaluate readmission rates and factors related.

40|$|The {{health care}} sector in New Zealand has {{undergone}} substantial structural reform since 1983, and stands out {{relative to other}} OECD countries, in {{that it has a}} relatively low per capita health expenditure, and a high share of public funding. Efficient allocation of resources to accommodate local needs in this community-oriented and public dominant model {{of the health care system}} is paramount. This paper employs the National Minimum Dataset from 2007 to 2011 to construct an empirical model aimed at predicting hospital demand. We formulate an easy to implement approach that can be used at the national level, as well as for individual District Health Boards (DHBs) that are regionally defined, and can also be disaggregated by category of patient, e. g. acute care versus elective admissions. We find the use of lagged information in this model to be vital, and by contrasting expected and actual demand, we then evaluate variations in excess demand. We find evidence that suggests in low risk elective cases, unexpected demand significantly reduces an individual’s hospital stay, and increases the likelihood of acute <b>readmission</b> <b>in</b> 30 days. Additionally, the cumulative evidence presented points to excess demand at both the hospital level and within-disease chapter, resulting in more attention paid to high risk patients, to the detriment of low risk cases. The negatively and significant association between hospital stay and <b>readmission</b> <b>in</b> 30 days for low risk cases may prompt policy makers to consider a ‘reduction <b>in</b> <b>readmission</b> program’ for New Zealand...|$|R

BackgroundBased on the REMATCH (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) study experience, readmissions after LVAD implantation are thought to be frequent. MethodsWe retrospectively analyzed admissions to our facility in a cohort of 115 patients implanted between January 2008 and July 2011 with the HeartMate II axial flow LVAD, of whom 42 were bridged to transplant. To account for repeated events, Andersen-Gill models were used to determine possible predictors. ResultsThe patients were followed for 1. 4 ± 0. 9 years. There were 224 <b>readmissions</b> <b>in</b> 83 patients. The overall readmission rate was 1. 64 ± 1. 97 per patient-year of follow-up. The readmission rate for the first 6 months was 2. 0 ± 2. 3 and decreased to 1. 2 ± 2. 1 during subsequent follow-up. Leading causes were bleeding (66 <b>readmissions</b> <b>in</b> 34 patients), mostly gastrointestinal bleed (51 in 27 patients), cardiac (51 in 36 patients, most for HF or arrhythmia), infections (32 in 25 patients) of which 6 were pump related, and thrombosis (20 in 15 patients) including 13 readmissions due to hemolysis. Preoperative variables associated with (fewer) <b>readmissions</b> <b>in</b> a multivariate model include residence within our hospital-extended referral zone of Minnesota and the neighboring states (hazard ratio: 0. 66; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 48 to 0. 91; p = 0. 011), hemoglobin (hazard ratio: 0. 91, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 84 to 0. 99; p = 0. 027) and N-terminal pro–B-type natriuretic peptide (hazard ratio: 0. 98; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 96 to 1. 0 per 1, 000 -unit increase, p = 0. 022).
