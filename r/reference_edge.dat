Recent work {{has shown that}} complementing CNNs with fully-connected conditional random fields (CRFs) can signif-icantly enhance their object localization accuracy, yet dense CRF inference is computationally expensive. We propose replacing the fully-connected CRF with domain transform (DT), a modern edge-preserving filtering method in which the amount of smoothing is controlled by a <b>reference</b> <b>edge</b> map. Domain transform filtering is several times faster than dense CRF inference and we show that it yields comparable semantic segmentation results, accurately capturing object boundaries. Importantly, our formulation allows learning the <b>reference</b> <b>edge</b> map from intermediate CNN features instead of using the image gradient magnitude as in stan-dard DT filtering. This produces task-specific edges in an end-to-end trainable system optimizing the target semantic segmentation quality. 1...|$|E

40|$|In this study, we {{measured}} blur discrimination threshold at different blur levels. We {{found that the}} discrimination threshold first decreased and then increased again as <b>reference</b> <b>edge</b> width blur increased. This dipper shape of the blur discrimination threshold vs. reference width functions (TvW) functions {{can be explained by}} a divisive inhibition model. The first stage of the model contains a linear operator whose excitation is the inner product of the image and the sensitivity profile of the operator. The response of the blur discrimination mechanism is the power function of the excitation of the linear operator divided by the sum of the divisive inhibition and an additive factor. Changing mean luminance of the edge has little effect on blur discrimination except at very low luminance. When luminance is low, the blur discrimination was higher at small reference blur than those measured at medium to high luminance. This difference diminished at large reference blur. Such luminance effect can be explained by a change in the additive factor in the model. Reducing contrast of the edge shifted the whole TvW function up vertically. This effect {{can be explained by the}} decrease of gain factors in the linear operator. With these results, we constructed a metric for blur perception from the divisive inhibition we proposed and tested in this study. © 2009 SPIE-IS&T. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of Computer Numerical Control (CNC), there is a growing need for reliable on-line tool condition monitoring systems that are capable of sensing worn or broken tools. A tool condition monitoring system not only prevents losses owing to spoilt jobs but also minimizes premature tool replacement. In the long run, it helps to reduce manufacturing costs, increase machine tool utilization, optimize cutting conditions and build a reliable and intelligent manufacturing system. This thesis presents a new method of tool condition monitoring for machining processes that employ rotating cutters, such as milling and drilling. It focusses on end-milling cutters but it can be extended to other types of rotating cutters as well. The method used for tool wear measurement is based on laser diffraction. As a coherent laser light source passes through a slit, which is formed between a <b>reference</b> <b>edge</b> and the cutting edge of the cutter, a characteristic diffraction pattern is obtained. The luminous pattern of light consists of a number of fringes. The image can be captured by a CCD camera and various image processing techniques are employed to determine the fringe spacing. The fringe spacing is mathematically correlated to the width of the slit and accordingly, can be used to calculate the tool wear. A prototype measurement system was designed and fabricated. Experiments were conducted and good results were obtained. Comparing the mechanical and optical measurements methods, the maximum error was only 16...|$|E
30|$|The morphologies {{of these}} GaN-based nanorod LED samples were {{carefully}} studied by {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM, Nova Nano SEM 430). For TDPL measurements, samples were stuck on a copper stage cold finger in a helium closed circuit cryostat with vacuum silicone. The temperature was changed from 8 to 300  K. A 405 -nm laser was used for excitation. The excitation-power density was about 100  W/cm 2, where the carrier density in the active region was estimated as 2 [*]×[*] 1018 /cm 3. The luminescence signal was coupled into a grating spectrometer. Then the dispersed luminescence was detected by a photomultiplier tubes (PMT). To compare the PL intensities of different size nanorod LEDs, a integrating sphere was used to avoid the effect of spatial emission distribution, where the incident direction was perpendicular {{to the surface of}} the samples. The TRPL measurements were performed by LifeSpec-Red Picosecond Lifetime Spectrometer. A pulsed 372 -nm laser was used as excitation source with a pulse duration of 69  ps. The laser excitation-power density was approximately 100  W/cm 2 too. The radiation patterns of nanorod arrays were measured by ARPL. The samples were excited by a 405 -nm laser with a vertical incident direction. The samples and laser spot were fixed at the rotation center of a rotary stage. The luminescence from MQWs went through a small aperture diaphragm, and then was focused into a fiber optic spectrometer. The fiber optic spectrometer was set 15  cm away from the laser spots on samples. During the measurements, the incident direction of laser was fixed, and the probed direction was changed from − 90 ° to 90 °, which corresponded to the zenith angle of the far-field pattern. The azimuth angles were set as zero according to the <b>reference</b> <b>edge</b> of the samples. At last, the full 3 D-FDTD simulation was performed to illustrate the electric field distribution of a single nanorod and nanorod arrays. Perfect matched layer (PML) boundary condition was adopted. The simulation area of nanorod array was 5 [*]×[*] 5  μm 2. The detector layer for far field was placed above the upper surface 300  nm. The detector layer for near field was positioned 20  nm spacing from the c-axis of nanorod. It is generally thought that spacing less than λ/ 2 π is in the near field range. The far-field results were obtained by applying the Fourier transform (FT) to the near field results [27]. A single dipole source (λ[*]=[*] 400 ~ 470  nm) polarized in the in-plane direction was positioned at the center of MQWs layer, which was similar to the SpE in MQWs. The refractive indices of GaN layers, InGaN QWs layers and air were set to be 2.52, 2.58, and 1.0, respectively. The absorption coefficient of GaN and InGaN QWs were chosen to be 10 and 5000  cm− 1.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Keyword {{search is}} a {{user-friendly}} way to query text, HTML, XML documents and even relational databases. The previous well-known semantic of LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) {{is used for}} XML keyword search based on tree model. However, LCA cannot exploit the information in ID references, thus may return a large tree containing irrelevant results. Another keyword search approach based on general digraph model of XML captures ID references, but it is computationally expensive. In this paper, we first discuss new LCRA semantics based on special directed graph model that distinguishes tree <b>edges</b> and <b>reference</b> <b>edges</b> in XML to overcome the problems of tree model and general digraph model. In particular, LCRA = LCA + LRA + ELRA, where LRA stands for Lowest Referred Ancestors and ELRA is Extended LRA. Then, we explore the semantics of existing bibliographic XML data to further simplify the LCRA semantics. We argue that keyword search based on simplified LCRA semantics for bibliographic XML data are effective and efficient as they not only elegantly capture the semantic information in ID references but also can be computed as efficiently as LCA for a large XML database.

40|$|The {{negative}} impact of road accidents {{can not be ignored}} in terms of the very sizeable social and economic loss. Road infrastructure has been identified as one of the main causes of the road accidents. They are required to be recorded, located, measured and classified in order to schedule maintenance and identify the possible risk elements of the road. Towards this an accurate knowledge of the road edges increases the reliability and precision of extracting other road features. We have developed an automated algorithm for extracting road edges from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) data based on the parametric active contour or snake model. The algorithm involves several internal and external energy parameters which need to be analysed in order to find their optimal values. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the snake energy parameters involved in our road edge extraction algorithm. Their optimal values enable us to automate the process of extracting edges from MLS data for tested road sections. We present a modified external energy in our algorithm and demonstrate its utility for extracting road edges from low and non-uniform point density datasets. A novel validation approach is presented which provides a qualitative assessment of the extracted road edges based on direct comparisons with <b>reference</b> road <b>edges.</b> This approach provides an alternative to traditional road edge validation methodologies which are based on creating buffer zones around <b>reference</b> road <b>edges</b> and then computing quality measure values for the extracted edges.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{guarantee}} the safe delivery of dynamic intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), verification of the leaf trajectories during the treatment is necessary. Our aim {{in this study is}} to develop a method for on-line verification of leaf trajectories using an electronic portal imaging device with scanning read-out, independent of the multileaf collimator. Examples of such scanning imagers are electronic portal imaging devices (EPIDs) based on liquid-filled ionization chambers and those based on amorphous silicon. Portal images were acquired continuously with a liquid-filled ionization chamber EPID during the delivery, together with the signal of treatment progress that is generated by the accelerator. For each portal image, the prescribed leaf and diaphragm positions were computed from the dynamic prescription and the progress information. Motion distortion effects of the leaves are corrected based on the treatment progress that is recorded for each image row. The aperture formed by the prescribed leaves and diaphragms is used as the <b>reference</b> field <b>edge,</b> while the actual field edge is found using a maximum-gradient edge detector. The errors in leaf and diaphragm position are found from the deviations between the <b>reference</b> field <b>edge</b> and the detected field edge. Earlier measurements of the dynamic EPID response show that the accuracy of the detected field edge is better than 1 mm. To ensure that the verification is independent of inaccuracies in the acquired progress signal, the signal was checked with diode measurements beforehand. The method was tested on three different dynamic prescriptions. Using the described method, we correctly reproduced the distorted field edges. Verifying a single portal image took 0. 1 s on an 866 MHz personal computer. Two flaws in the control system of our experimental dynamic multileaf collimator were correctly revealed with our method. First, the errors in leaf position increase with leaf speed, indicating a delay of approximately 0. 8 s in the control system. Second, the accuracy of the leaves and diaphragms depends on the direction of motion. In conclusion, the described verification method is suitable for detailed verification of leaf trajectories during dynamic IMR...|$|R
