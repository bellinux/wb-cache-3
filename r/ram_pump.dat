50|$|The first {{self-acting}} <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> {{was invented}} by the Frenchman Joseph Michel Montgolfier (best known as a co-inventor of the hot air balloon) in 1796 for raising water in his paper mill at Voiron. His friend Matthew Boulton took out a British patent on his behalf in 1797. The sons of Montgolfier obtained a British patent for an improved version in 1816, and this was acquired, together with Whitehurst's design, in 1820 by Josiah Easton, a Somerset-born engineer who had just moved to London.|$|E

50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the twentieth}} century {{interest}} in hydraulic rams has revived, due to the needs of sustainable technology in developing countries, and energy conservation in developed ones. A good example is AID Foundation International in the Philippines, who won an Ashden Award for their work developing <b>ram</b> <b>pumps</b> that could be easily maintained for use in remote villages. The hydraulic ram principle has been used in some proposals for exploiting wave power, one of which was discussed as long ago as 1931 by Hanns Günther in his book In hundert Jahren.|$|R
50|$|Similar pumping engines {{were also}} used in waterworks. Inverted {{vertical}} engines had their cylinder {{at the top and}} water <b>ram</b> <b>pumps</b> at their base, or in a borehole below them. A crankshaft and flywheels were provided in the space between these, for smoother running rather than rotary power output. These were driven from the lower (pump) yoke, by short return connecting rods. Two Worth McKenzie engines of this type; a triple-expansion engine on 1895 and a duplex simple of 1906 were installed at the Waterworks Museum, Hereford, Hereford and are preserved in steam there.|$|R
5000|$|A {{traditional}} {{hydraulic ram}} {{has only two}} moving parts, a spring or weight loaded [...] "waste" [...] valve sometimes known as the [...] "clack" [...] valve and a [...] "delivery" [...] check valve, making it cheap to build, easy to maintain, and very reliable. The Papa hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> also has only two moving parts. However, these are not mechanical but instead rely on the elastomeric properties of the main valve and non-return valve which are low-cost, reliable and easy to replace. In addition, there is a drive pipe supplying water from an elevated source and a delivery pipe, taking {{a portion of the}} water that comes through the drive pipe to an elevation higher than the source.|$|E

50|$|In 1870 {{the land}} {{extended}} to 400 acres {{and life in}} the great house was on a grand scale. Two Head Gardeners were employed, one for inside the walled garden to grow fruit and vegetables {{and the other to}} supervise the seven acres of pleasure gardens. A duty for one of the maids each week was to wash and scrub the granite steps in the garden. In the summer, 20 boys from the village of Rathnew were employed to hoe the extensive rose garden. There are fine stands of beech eucalyptus and evergreen oak while two giant sequoias (American Redwood) are {{at either end of the}} old tennis court. The site chosen for the house is on elevated ground two miles north of Wicklow Town, overlooking Broadlough Bird Sanctuary and the Irish Sea. There was however no source of fresh water. A stream about a half mile away and 150ft lower was found and a leather <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> was built to feed three 1,000 gallon tanks in the roof of Tinakilly. In later years even the local council water was unsatisfactory and a 300ft well was sunk to guarantee a sure supply.|$|E

500|$|After 1903, a [...] {{frame with}} a longer {{overhang}} {{at the front}} end was introduced and steam reversing gear fitted. Some sources record these locomotives as X14 class, and this designation was sometimes {{used to refer to}} the longer-framed versions, but for most purposes the two sub-classes were grouped together and known as M7. The 1904/05 construction batch moved the sandboxes back to the front splasher and new items were feed water heating, single <b>ram</b> <b>pumps</b> and balanced crank axles. For the remainder of construction from the outshopping of the 105th locomotive in 1911, duplex pumps were fitted.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was {{primarily}} to promote the wider deployment of the hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump,</b> and secondarily to provide the technical input into a programme aimed at using hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> technologies for third world development. Hitherto hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> technologies have been restricted by poor understanding of operational parameters, poor performance prediction, and poor design of pumps and installations. In pursuit of greater understanding the work utilised a computer simulation developed by the author as part of a previous research programme. This simulation was then greatly enhanced to provide improved accuracy and functionality. The enhanced simulation was then used to provide significant insight into the operation of a hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> and subsequently used to identify design improvements for the hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump.</b> The simulation was used to investigate operational restrictions on the hydraulic ram, and was ultimately use to develop a model of hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> operation. The model of operation developed by the use of the simulation was computerised and used to predict the performance of hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> installations. This computerised model was then used to provide the most comprehensive design charts yet created for hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump,</b> and was also used in the investigation of operational limits for the device. The study represents: the development of the first detailed simulation of the hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> and the most significant insight to date into the detail of operation of a hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump.</b> The result of the study is the provision of an accurate method of pump calibration, an accurate method of pump performance prediction, and the first comprehensive design charts to be produced for the hydraulic <b>ram</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{water used}} for the gardens comes from natural springs. A unique <b>ram</b> system <b>pumps</b> the water 300 ft. up to a storage {{reservoir}} holding approximately 15,000 gallons.

The system is designed to ensure there is natural fresh water for the gardens throughout the summer, even during a long drought.|$|R
5000|$|While {{a simple}} siphon cannot output liquid {{at a level}} higher than the source reservoir, a more {{complicated}} device utilizing an airtight metering chamber at the crest and a system of automatic valves, may discharge liquid on an ongoing basis, at a level higher than the source reservoir, without outside pumping energy being added. It can accomplish this despite what initially {{appears to be a}} violation of conservation of energy because it {{can take advantage of the}} energy of a large volume of liquid dropping some distance, to raise and discharge a small volume of liquid above the source reservoir. Thus it might be said to [...] "require" [...] a large quantity of falling liquid to power the dispensing of a small quantity. Such a system typically operates in a cyclical or start/stop but ongoing and self-powered manner. <b>Ram</b> <b>pumps</b> do not work in this way. These metering pumps are true siphon pumping devices which use siphons as their power source.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{hydraulic}} <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> {{was invented}} over 200 {{years ago but}} became obsolete with the general availability of mains water. It is used for pumping surface water and is powered by the potential energy of the supply. Ram pumps are particularly appropriate for use in remote regions {{of the developing world}} as their construction is basic and robust and they are inexpensive and easy to install and maintain. A rational design procedure applicable to any <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> is described in this paper. The method is based on the three non-dimensional relationships that have been found to govern <b>ram</b> <b>pump</b> behaviour. The relationships express beat frequency, quantity delivered and source capacity in terms of the independent variables. By assigning upper and lower bounds to the critical velocity in the drive pipe, it is possible to derive three characteristic pump parameters from which the dependent variables may be determined directly. These parameters all take the same numerical values within a feasible design space. The design method has been confirmed using the results of existing experiments. A number of examples are given which illustrate the ease and rapidity of the procedure...|$|E
