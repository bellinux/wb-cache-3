2500|$|The use of ice to {{refrigerate}} and preserve food {{dates back to}} prehistoric times. Through the ages, the seasonal harvesting of snow and ice was a regular practice of many cultures. China, Greece, and Rome stored ice and snow in caves, dugouts or ice houses lined with straw or other insulating materials. Rationing of the ice allowed the preservation of foods during hot periods, a practice that was successfully employed for centuries. For most of the 19th century, natural ice (harvested from ponds and lakes) was used to supply refrigerator cars. At high altitudes or northern latitudes, one foot tanks were often filled with water and allowed to freeze. Ice was typically cut into blocks during the winter and stored in insulated warehouses for later use, with sawdust and hay packed around the ice blocks to provide additional insulation.

50|$|The high {{freezing}} point depression e.g. {{in comparison to the}} still frequently used urea (which is effective but problematic due to eutrophication) effectively prevents the <b>re-icing,</b> even at temperatures below −15 °C. The thawing effect of the solid sodium formate can even be increased by moistening with aqueous potassium formate or potassium acetate solutions. The degradability of sodium formate is particularly advantageous with a chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 211 mg O2/g compared with the de-icing agents sodium acetate (740 mg O2/g) and urea with (> 2,000 mg O2/g).|$|E
50|$|Roy Edward Richter {{was born}} on March 16, 1914 to Otto and Cora Richter in thse small town of Dupo, Illinois. Dupo sits across from St. Louis, Missouri on the Mississippi River. Roy's brother Melbourne was also born in Dupo in 1912. Roy's father was from Germany. His mother was of English, Irish, and French descent. The couple lived in Missouri before moving to Dupo. The family had many {{relations}} involved in the railroad industry. Dupo {{had one of the}} largest railroad switching yards in the country. It included a huge <b>re-icing</b> depot until refrigerated railroad cars became common.|$|E

50|$|The United Fruit Co., now Chiquita, began {{shipping}} bananas from South America by ship to New Orleans. The bananas {{were loaded}} onto railcars {{on top of}} 162 lb blocks of ice for the trip north. Fulton had the only ice house on the route north to Chicago. The bananas were <b>re-iced</b> with blocks from the Fulton Ice Plant, now closed. Empty railcars were {{pulled up to the}} side of the ice house, and the large blocks of ice were loaded end up covering the entire box car. The bananas were then laid on top of the ice to continue their journey. At one point, over 70% of the bananas that were consumed in the US passed through Fulton.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the latter}} half of the 20th century, {{mechanical}} refrigeration began to replace ice-based systems. Soon after, mechanical refrigeration units replaced the [...] "armies" [...] of personnel required to <b>re-ice</b> the cars. The plug door was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car. By the mid-1970s, the few remaining ice bunker cars were relegated to [...] "top-ice" [...] service, where crushed ice was applied atop the commodity.|$|R

40|$|Dr. Desch {{explores the}} impact of {{diminishing}} arctic ice on climate change, and proposes a novel solution for <b>re-icing</b> the arctic. Dr. Steve Desch is a Professor of astrophysics in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University (2003 -present). In 1998 he earned a Ph. D. in Physics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, with a background in physics and astrophysics. Throughout his career he has applied these skills to interdisciplinary problems, broadening his research to meteoritics, planet formation and evolution, astrobiology, exoplanets, and now the Arctic. Steve Desch was the 2003 recipient of the Alfred O. Nier Prize of the Meteoritical Society for his work modeling the formation of chondrules, millimeter-sized melt droplets found in abundance in meteorites. He has developed models of the internal thermal evolution and structure of Pluto’s moon Charon, and the largest asteroid, Ceres; each {{at the forefront of}} research to interpret data from the New Horizons and Dawn spacecraft. He is the Chair of the NASA-sponsored biennial Astrobiology Science Conference, as well as the principal investigator of a NASA-sponsored project at ASU working to understand geochemical cycles on exoplanets. Most recently, Steve Desch has expanded his horizons to consider Earth as a planet, and to develop strategies for managing and maintaining sea ice in the Arctic...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this project}} was to study the {{influence}} of temperature abuse {{during the early stages}} of storage on the shelf life of Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus). A shelf life study was performed with farmed Arctic charr stored under two different conditions: a) iced and stored at 1 oC (well handled lot) and b) iced, but stored at 18 oC for 24 hours (resulting in a temperature increase from 3 - 12 °C) {{on the second day of}} storage prior to <b>re-icing</b> and storage at 1 oC (temperature abused lot). Approximately every third day during storage, samples were collected for sensory analysis using the Quality Index Method (QIM) and Quantitative Descriptive Analysis (QDA) and microbiological counts (Total Viable Counts (TVC) and H 2 S producing bacteria). The maximum shelf life of well handled and temperature abused Arctic charr was 17 and 15 days respectively according to sensory evaluation of cooked fillets (QDA). Sensory evaluation showed a high linear correlation between Quality Index (QI) and storage time for the well handled lot. At the end of shelf life the QI was 17 for both groups. The TVC at the consumption limits were 105 - 106 CFU/g of flesh for both lots. H 2 S producing bacteria constituted a higher proportion of TVC in the abused than in the well handled fish at the end o...|$|E
40|$|Anchovies {{are a very}} labile {{fish and}} {{deteriorate}} fast under chilling conditions. In the South of Spain, fishing boats land their catches in wooden boxes with ice (12 to 14 kg). For some years now, fish processors have prepared this species for market distribution by placing about 7 kg fish in expanded polystyrene (EPS) boxes containing water and ice. Then, in the distribution market, boxes are dewatered and <b>re-iced.</b> Transportation of the fish in EPS boxes containing water and ice was recently forbidden {{on the grounds that}} boxes for transportation of fish in ice must have holes to let melted ice drain away. In this paper, the effect of preserving the anchovy in water and ice from landing to the distribution market was studied and compared with the more traditional methods of storing the fish in ice in either wooden or EPS boxes. Physical, chemical, microbiological, and sensory analyses were carried out over three different storage trials to account for the effect of seasonality. Little differences were found among lots, but some of the parameters showed that fish transported in water and ice did present less spoilage than fish stored in ice, especially when compared to the wooden boxes. According to these results, chilling of this fish in water and ice can be used as an alternative preserving method during transport. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
2500|$|The Redskins {{began the}} 2007 season by [...] "winning ugly" [...] {{starting}} the season off 2–0. The Redskins kept {{winning and losing}} close games, the only exception to this a 34–3 rout of the Detroit Lions. The Redskins continued to win ugly and lose ugly to be 5–3 at the halfway mark. However, the Redskins would begin to collapse. The Washington Redskins lost their next three games to fall to 5–6. On Monday, November 26, 2007, Redskins superstar, Sean Taylor was shot by intruders {{early in the morning}} in his Miami home. The next morning, Sean Taylor died from severe blood loss. The heartbreak continued for the Washington Redskins, taking a 9–2 halftime lead against the Buffalo Bills, and eventually a 16–5 lead. However, the Bills cut the lead to 16–14, and got into position with just 8 seconds remaining to win the game. In an attempt to ice the kicker, head coach Joe Gibbs called timeout. However, he attempted to <b>re-ice</b> him, and called timeout again, which drew an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, reducing the field goal from 51 yards to 36, and Bills kicker Rian Lindell nailed it with ease. Following the heartbreaking loss, the Redskins attended Sean Taylor's funeral two days later, with a game to play on Thursday night against the Chicago Bears. The bad news continued, as quarterback Jason Campbell went down for the season with a knee injury. Following this, unlikely hero and backup quarterback Todd Collins led the Redskins to the victory, keeping their playoff hopes alive. Things continued to turn in the right direction behind Collins, who led the Redskins to a 22–10 victory on Sunday Night Football over the New York Giants and routs of the Minnesota Vikings and rival Dallas Cowboys in the final two weeks to propel the Redskins to 9–7 and the final playoff spot in the NFL playoffs.|$|R
