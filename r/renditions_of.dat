5|$|In many <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the myth, Manasa is {{depicted}} as being quite dependent on Neta (traditionally imagined as a washerwoman) for ideas and moral support. In fact, of the two, Manasa is often the stupider one - a curious instance of anthropomorphism.|$|E
5|$|Poe {{was also}} known as a writer of fiction and {{became one of the first}} American authors of the 19th century to become more popular in Europe than in the United States. Poe is {{particularly}} respected in France, in part due to early translations by Charles Baudelaire. Baudelaire's translations became definitive <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> Poe's work throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The DK Rap {{is remembered}} for its {{negative}} reception. <b>Renditions</b> <b>of</b> the song later appeared in Super Smash Bros. Melee and Donkey Konga. Over {{a decade after}} the game's release, its composer said that the rap was enjoying a resurgence in popularity despite its initial unpopularity. In 2017, he composed a similar rap for Yooka-Laylee, a platform game made in homage to Rare's oeuvre.|$|E

5|$|Together with Weldon Irvine, Simone turned Lorraine Hansberry's {{unfinished}} play To Be Young, Gifted and Black into a {{civil rights}} song. Hansberry had been a personal friend whom Simone credited with cultivating her social and political consciousness. She performed the song live on the album Black Gold (1970). A studio recording was released as a single, and <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the song have been recorded by Aretha Franklin (on her 1972 album Young, Gifted and Black) and by Donny Hathaway.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, MOBA {{announced}} a fundraiser {{to assist the}} Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in Bernard Madoff's investment scheme. Current MOBA curator and balloon artist/musician Michael Frank placed Studies in Digestion—a four-panel piece showing four <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the human digestive tract in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on eBay for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99. It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending the hill to reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E

30|$|The above studies {{essentially}} propose {{rules for}} the implementation <b>of</b> the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> specific typographic attributes. It is obvious that a systematic methodology towards the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> typographic signals does not exist. The present work introduces the emotional-based mapping methodology for rendering font cues to auditory modality. The methodology is applied in a case study for font size and style. We determine the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> the font attributes by combining a text font-to-emotional state model and expressive speech synthesis. By conducting a number of psychoacoustic experiments, we determine the acoustic <b>rendition</b> <b>of</b> text font cues. Our {{ultimate goal is to}} incorporate automatic text font-to-speech mapping in DtA by emotional analogy between the visual (text font cues) and the acoustic (speech prosody) modalities.|$|R
5|$|Nutini is {{also known}} for his live {{performances}} and numerous extended plays {{of some of his}} recordings. His first, the Live Sessions EP, was released in September 2006 and featured exclusive live versions of four fan favourite tracks mainly recorded in London. Recorded Live at Preservation Hall was released exclusively in the United States in March 2010 and features <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> songs originally found on Sunny Side Up; it was then re-released as a limited edition album in independent record stores in April.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from his temple who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E
5|$|Released in six formats {{featuring}} a photograph by JFKK, A Ballads received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for {{including some of}} Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching {{number one on the}} Oricon Albums Chart, making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the series has been {{primarily}} composed by Yoko Shimomura. Kaoru Wada works as the arranger for orchestral music, including orchestral <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the main vocal themes and the ending themes. The orchestral music was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra. Soundtracks were released {{for the first and}} third installments following the release of their respective games. A compilation soundtrack was later released that included soundtracks for the entire series, including reworked tracks for the re-released Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories.|$|E
5|$|Though the Maya Sita motif {{was found}} {{earlier in the}} Kurma Purana and the Brahma Vaivarta Purana (801–1100 CE) where Sita's purity is safeguarded, it is the Adhyatma Ramayana (a part of the Brahmanda Purana, c. 14th century), where Maya Sita plays a much greater role in the plot. The concept of maya (illusion) is an {{integral}} part of the narrative; the best examples being Maya Sita and Maya mriga (illusory deer). Though Adhyatma Ramayana originated in Varanasi in North India, it influenced Malayam (South India) and Oriya (East India) <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the Ramayana, but most importantly influenced the Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas (c.1532–1623).|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Ono {{produced}} her own off-Broadway musical entitled New York Rock, featuring Broadway <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> her songs. In 1995, {{she released}} Rising, a collaboration {{with her son}} Sean and his then-band, Ima. Rising spawned a world tour that traveled through Europe, Japan, and the United States. The following year, she collaborated with various alternative rock musicians for an EP entitled Rising Mixes. Guest remixers of Rising material included Cibo Matto, Ween, Tricky, and Thurston Moore. In 1997, Rykodisc reissued all her solo albums on CD, from Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band through Starpeace. Ono and her engineer Rob Stevens personally remastered the audio, and various bonus tracks were added, including outtakes, demos, and live cuts.|$|E

5|$|Mayor John Curtis began {{a public}} process {{to replace the}} flag in 2013, in {{response}} to the second NAVA survey, consulting with local vexillologists and residents for ideas. In May 2014, the flag replacement process was narrowed to two options by a three-member committee, both consisting of simple <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> Utah Lake and nearby mountains, with one option having three stars to represent life in Provo. The designs were not well received by residents, leading Mayor Curtis to propose a public design contest to end in early June. A consensus was reached by residents to not use the color red in the new flag, as it is used by the University of Utah, a rival to Provo's Brigham Young University.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the field}} of comics, Adams has also {{provided}} illustrations for various magazines, such as , as well as toy designs, video games, and X-Men-themed cans of Chef Boyardee pasta. In 2016 he provided the illustration for a satirical piece in GQ magazine that imagined a number of controversial public figures as comic book supervillains, including Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Sepp Blatter, Martin Shkreli and Kris Jenner. Later that year, Dynamite Entertainment announced it that would be producing limited edition poly-resin busts of female characters for its Women of Dynamite line, based on Adams' <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> those characters and sculpted by Jason Smith. The first bust was a Red Sonja bust debuting in November, followed by a Vampirella bust in February 2017.|$|E
5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E. Gadd provides the player with advice throughout the game, while Toadsworth teaches the player new moves and skills to progress through the adventure. Although the older Peach is kidnapped, Baby Peach is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth, where she is nurtured by both the old and young <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby Peach, although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E

5|$|Shortly before McCartney's {{announcement}} in April 1970, he and Starr fell out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album {{to allow for}} Starr's debut, Sentimental Journey, and the Beatles' Let It Be. Starr's album – composed of <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed Sentimental Journey with the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite receiving some favourable reviews, the album failed to meet with commercial success. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing {{a career as a}} film actor.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, El Concierto {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its production, Miguel's vocals, and his <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> Jiménez's rancheras. The album peaked at number {{two on the}} Billboard Top Latin Albums chart and both the album and video were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. It topped the Argentine Albums Chart and the album was certified 4 platinum by CAPIF. The record also reached number two on the Chilean Albums Chart and achieved platinum status in the country {{as well as in}} Mexico, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The album sold over two million copies within a year of its release. El Concierto won the Eres award for Album of the Year and received a nomination for Pop Album of the Year at the 1996 Lo Nuestro Awards.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh {{strove to}} be a painter of rural life and nature, and {{during his first}} summer in Arles he used his new palette to paint landscapes and {{traditional}} rural life. His belief that a power existed behind the natural led {{him to try to}} capture a sense of that power, or the essence of nature in his art, sometimes through the use of symbols. His <b>renditions</b> <b>of</b> the sower, at first copied from Jean-François Millet, reflect Van Gogh's religious beliefs: the sower as Christ sowing life beneath the hot sun. These were themes and motifs he returned to often to rework and develop. His paintings of flowers are filled with symbolism, but rather than use traditional Christian iconography he made up his own, where life is lived under the sun and work is an allegory of life. In Arles, having gained confidence after painting spring blossoms and learning to capture bright sunlight, he was ready to paint The Sower.|$|E
