40|$|International audienceThe {{separation}} of the lead vocals from the background accompani- ment in audio recordings is a challenging task. Recently, an efficient method called <b>REPET</b> (REpeating Pattern Extraction Technique) has been proposed to extract the repeating background from the non- repeating foreground. While effective on individual sections of a song, <b>REPET</b> {{does not allow for}} variations in the background (e. g. verse vs. chorus), and is thus limited to short excerpts only. We overcome this limitation and generalize <b>REPET</b> to permit the processing of complete musical tracks. The proposed algorithm tracks the period of the repeating structure and computes local estimates of the background pattern. Separation is performed by soft time-frequency masking, based on the deviation between the current observation and the estimated background pattern. Evaluation on a dataset of 14 complete tracks shows that this method can perform at least as well as a recent competitive music/voice separation method, while being computationally efficient...|$|E

The Longitudinal Small Business Survey (LSBS) is a large-scale telephone survey of 15, 502 UK small business owners and managers, commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS). This survey {{is the latest in}} a series of annual and biennial Small Business Surveys (SBS) dating back to 2003. The Year One LSBS is the largest SBS yet undertaken. The main reason for this is to allow the survey to have a longitudinal tracking element, establishing a 'panel' or businesses that will be re-surveyed in subsequent years. This will allow a detailed analysis of how combinations of factors affect business performance. The LSBS is intended to: Improve the understanding of what drives and constrains business performance and growth by addressing evidence gaps relating to the lags between many business activities and associated performance outcomes; Provide improved data on current business performance and the factors that affect this. The larger survey size will provide more reliable findings for key sub-groups of the business population and in relation to activities such as seeking finance which are only relevant to part of the sample. It is the intention to repeat the current survey with an updated sample each year for the next five years. <b>Repeted</b> Cross-Sectional Studies Until 2015 the SBS has been designed as a <b>repeted</b> cross-sectional study, conducted annually from 2003 to 2008, and every two years from 2010. Research reports for these surveys are published by BIS, please see Small Business Survey Reports. The 2014 datasets, covering the businesses surveyed, businesses with no employees and SMEs with employees, are available via the UK Data Service and held under SN 7814.

40|$|Tracheal {{collapse}} is {{the most}} common tracheal disease occurring by the miniature dog breeds. This disease is usually found with middle to older aged dogs, but can be found even with the younger dogs. It is likely a congenital disease, athwart can be caused by outer factors or chronical breathing illnesses (<b>repeted</b> infections,alergies,dusty environment [...] .) 	Dogs trachea is the connector between uper and lower airways (connect larynx with bronchi). The trachea is formed by cartilage rings, connected by ligaments. These rings aren't dorsally closed - in this area the cartilage is replaced by a muscle covered in respiratory mucos membrane. 	Tracheal collapse can affect cervical and sternal section of trachea, even the bronchi can be striken. 	The collapse of trachea is caused by tracheal cartilage collapse, witch leads to tapered tracheal gateway. It is histologically proven, that the affected cartilage tissue lacks some compounds, in concrete glycoproteins, glycosaminoglycans and chondroitin sulfat, that makes the cartilage mellow. 	This disease displays itself by a variety of clinical symptoms - the first stage brings excitation of airways and coughing when dog is physically active or shows signs of excitement (positive or negative), also can be caused by mechanical tracheal irritation (collar), nurture and fluid intake. Gradual disease worsening causes inspiratory troubles that leads to asphyxiation. There are four known grades of tracheal collapse phased in according to cartilage rings collapse range. 	Tracheal checkup is commonly executed via tracheoscopy, witch reveals the tracheal inner condition. 	Treatment is addicted to few spects : tracheal disorder ratio, age of the dog, but also owners economical situation. The treatment is strictly individual. When the disease is not fully developed, the treatment is based on pharmaceutics, mostly corticosteroids. Further grades of the disease asks for more severe surgical help.

40|$|Background Reduction of readmissions after {{discharge}} {{represents an}} important challenge for many hospitals and has attracted {{the interest of}} many researchers {{in the past few}} years. Most of the studies in this field focus on building cross-sectional predictive models that aim to predict the occurrence of readmission within 30 -days based on information from the current hospitalization. The aim of this study is demonstration of predictive performance gain obtained by inclusion of information from historical hospitalization records among morbidly obese patients. Methods The California Statewide inpatient database was used to build regularized logistic regression models for prediction of readmission in morbidly obese patients (n =  18, 881). Temporal features were extracted from historical patient hospitalization records in a one-year timeframe. Five different datasets of patients were prepared {{based on the number of}} available hospitalizations per patient. Sample size of the five datasets ranged from 4, 787 patients with more than five hospitalizations to 20, 521 patients with at least two hospitalization records in one year. A 10 -fold cross validation was <b>repeted</b> 100 times to assess the variability of the results. Additionally, random forest and extreme gradient boosting were used to confirm the results. Results Area under the ROC curve increased significantly when including information from up to three historical records on all datasets. The inclusion of more than three historical records was not efficient. Similar results can be observed for Brier score and PPV value. The number of selected predictors corresponded to the complexity of the dataset ranging from an average of 29. 50 selected features on the smallest dataset to 184. 96 on the largest dataset based on 100 repetitions of 10 -fold cross-validation. Discussion The results show positive influence of adding information from historical hospitalization records on predictive performance using all predictive modeling techniques used in this study. We can conclude that it is advantageous to build separate readmission prediction models in subgroups of patients with more hospital admissions by aggregating information from up to three previous hospitalizations...|$|R

The aim of this study was to asses the impact of different tillage treatments on hydraulic conductivity in the locality Bohaté Málkovice. Field experimental works in this area were performed in 2009 and were <b>repeted</b> in 2011 on Haplic Chernozem, medium heavy loamy soil. The experimental area was divided into two parts; top layer of these plots was cultivated by applying conventional and reduced tillage treatment. Both these plots were sown with spring barley (Hordeum vulgare). For the field measurement of water infiltration {{into the soil}} was used double-ring infiltrometer (2009, 2011) and Minidisk infiltrometer (2011). Near the point were the infiltration was measured, the soil samples were always collected for laboratory determination of basic physical properties of soil (bulk density, porosity, initial and saturated water content, aeration of the soil) and saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks. For laboratory determination of Ks was used permeameter with constant gradient. For evaluation of saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks using the double-ring infiltration method was used Philip’s three-parameter equation and for evaluation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity K(h) using Minidisk infiltrometer was used Zang’s method. After two years of using repeatedly applied different tillage treatments was significantly influenced saturated hydraulic conductivity Ks. The Ks value increased approximately six times for reduced tillage and more than three times for conventional tillage. Laboratory determined average values of Ks were compared with the average estimates of Ks from infiltration tests. The results were burdened by a number of errors (compaction, preferential flow). These mean values were higher for conventional and reduced tillage.

By such contrivance the moisture content of the soil in the aluminium dish was always kept constant. 2) The author made six apparatuses as mentioned above, and arranged them as shown in fig. 1, the following quantities of sunshine: 0. 00, 0. 73, 1. 27, 1. 73, 2. 22 and 2. 68 cal/cm^ 2 min. were applied to the respective soil surface of the above apparatuses. 3) The soil temperatures in the above dishes were read by the thermometers in the soil. After the soil temperatures become constant, the water quantities evaporated from the soil surface in 100 min. was measured by the decreased quantities of water in the glass dishes. 4) The air temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure in the laboratory measured accurately during the experiment. By <b>repeting</b> the above experiment seventeen times, the author obtained the follwing results: 1) The evaporating quantity from the soil surface increases in proportion to the quantity of sunshine. 2) The higher the soil temperature, the larger the increasing ratio of evaporation quantity become.

Results: A total of 14 implants (8 incisors, 1 canines, 5 premolars) placed in 11 patients (4 men / 7 women) aged from 22 to 60 years old (48, 5 +/- 11, 5) could be assessed for the entire follow-up period. 2 patients dropped out. All implants reached an adequate primary stability (> 20 N/cm 2) to perform an immediate implant restoration. Straight pre-shaped Zirconium abutment was used in each case. Six implants were placed in socket preservation sites and five implants were placed simultaneously with a GBR. After a follow-up period of 1 year, all implants fulfilled survival criteria for dental implants with regard to osteointegration, including the absence of peri-implant radiolucency, implant mobility, suppuration, and pain. One abutment screw loosening was observed during the provisional period and no abutment fracture occurred. Definitive full ceramic-cemented restorations were successfully performed on each implant after a mean period of 6 months and no further complications occurred. In 11 out of 14 implants, an improvement of the papilla index was observed from baseline to 1 year follow-up whereas 3 implants showed a decrease of this index. Conclusion: The results from this prospective case series suggest that immediately restored implants using a final pre-shaped zirconium abutment in esthetic zone display favorable implant and prosthodontic outcomes and seems to allow an adequate papilla index improvement in most of the cases.

CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODO: O estudo incluiu 542 sujeitos com DAC submetidos a um dos tratamentos: cirúrgico, clínico ou por angioplastia. Dos participantes, 376 eram homens (58, 5 dp 8, 7 anos) e 166 mulheres (61, 8 dp 9, 2 anos). O instrumento de avaliação foi o Questionário Genérico de Avaliação de Qualidade de vida (SF- 36), aplicado no início do tratamento, após seis e doze meses. A análise estatística foi realizada pelo teste ANOVA. RESULTADOS: Em relação aos componentes físicos do SF- 36, o grupo cirúrgico exibiu escores de 46, 63 e 68, respectivamente, na fase inicial, seis e doze meses; o clínico 52, 65 e 62 e a angioplastia 57, 66 e 70. Os escores dos componentes mentais do tratamento cirúrgico foram 58, 71 e 74, do clínico 61, 69 e 69 e da angioplastia 64, 74 e 74. As diferenças foram significantes ao longo do tempo e entre os tratamentos (p< 0, 01). Na comparação entre os gêneros notou-se que os componentes físicos nos homens apresentaram respectivamente escores de 56 *, 69 e 77 * e nas mulheres 41 *, 64 e 62 *; os componentes mentais nos homens revelaram 61 *, 73 e 80 * e nas mulheres 51 *, 68 e 62 * (*p< 0, 0001). CONCLUSÕES: Os sujeitos submetidos ao tratamento cirúrgico mostraram evolução mais favorável. Os homens apresentaram melhor qualidade de vida no início e se beneficiaram progressivamente após seis e doze meses dos tratamentos realizados, enquanto nas mulheres a melhora ocorreu aos seis meses, reduzindo-se aos doze. OBJECTIVE: To analyse {{the quality}} of life of people with {{coronary}} artery disease (CAD) who underwent distinct therapeutic interventions and to compare the possible differences between genders. METHOD: This study comprised 542 subjects, 376 men (58, 5 years) and 166 women (61, 8 years) with CAD, who underwent surgical, medical treatment or angioplasty. Quality of life was assessed with The Medical Outcomes Study 36 -item short-form health survey (SF- 36) that was administered at the beginning of the treatment, after 6 and 12 months; the applied statistical method was the ANOVA test.

Programa de Pós-Graduação em Ciência e Engenharia de MateriaisNeste trabalho foram produzidos materiais hibridos formados de microesferas de carbono com nanoparticulas de niquel metalico. Eles foram obtidos por quatro rotas distintas, aqui identificadas como H 1, H 2, H 3 e H 4. Previamente tambem foram produzidas esferas de carbono atraves da polimerizacao da glicose pelo metodo hidrotermico. Depois de varios testes, escolheram-se as condicoes: solucao aquosa 0, 5 molar de glicose, temperatura de tratamento 190. C por tres horas. Com esses parametros foram obtidos de forma reprodutivel, esferas de carbono lisas e individuais, com morfologia perfeitamente esferica, diametro medio de 345 nm e desvio padrao de 53 nm (ou seja 15 % de dispersividade). Esta amostra, chamada de EC, serviu como referencia para a sintese dos hibridos H 1 e H 2 e como precursora para as rotas H 3 e H 4. Na rota H 1 foi acrescentado um sal de niquel a solucao de glicose que foi entao processada tal como a amostra de referencia EC. O {{material}} se apresentou na forma de esferas lisas, um pouco agregadas, com diametros muito grandes, acima de 10 micrmetros e com alta dispersividade. A analise EDS indicou a presenca de niquel e a DRX mostrou que apos um tratamento termico em atmosfera de argonio e hidrogenio a 370. C/ 2 h aparece o perfil JCPDS 00 - 004 - 0850 do niquel metalico nanometrico. O rendimento da amostra foi de 3, 5 vezes maior que da amostra EC. Na rota H 2 foram acrescentadas nanoparticulas de niquel metalico (recem preparadas) a solucao de glicose que foi entao processada tal como a amostra de referencia. Foram obtidas duas fases distintas, uma formada de esferas lisas, individuais e com diametros maiores que 3 micrmetros e outra fase formada de esferas agregadas e com diametros menores que 500 nanometros. A analise de EDS indicou a presenca de niquel em ambas as fases e a DRX mostra que apos o tratamento em atmosfera de argonio e hidrogenio a 370. C/ 2 h, o niquel e metalico e nanometrico. Aqui o rendimento tambem foi cerca de 3, 5 vezes maior que o da amostra EC. Para a rota H 3 foram usadas as esferas de carbono, amostra EC, como precursoras; em uma dispersao destas, foi acrescentado um sal de niquel, que em seguida e convertido a hidroxido de niquel. Este sistema, apos sonicado e envelhecido (para provocar a quimisorcao do hidroxido de niquel nas esferas do material carbonaceo), e submetido a um redutor quimico. As analises mostram que se formam nanoparticulas de niquel, sejam dispersas sobre a superficie das esferas de carbono, sejam aglomeradas no espaco entre as esferas de carbono. Por fim, na rota H 4 as esferas de carbono precursoras (amostra EC) foram parcialmente encharcadas com uma solucao de cloreto de niquel, que e evaporada logo apos. O processo chamado de #gincipient wetness method#h e repetido varias vezes. Formam-se nanocristais de cloreto de niquel nos nanoporos superficiais das esferas de carbono. Apos tratamento em argonio, as analises de MET mostram nanocristais de niquel individuais e bem dispersos sobre a superficie das esferas de carbono. Apresentamos tambem, alguns resultados de um tratamento termico em atmosfera redutora. In {{this work}} we produced hybrid materials formed of carbon microspheres with metallic nickel nanoparticles. They {{were obtained by}} four different routes identified here by H 1, H 2, H 3 and H 4. Previously we also produced carbon spheres through the polymerization of glucose by the hidrothermal method. After various experiences, we choose the following conditions: aqueous solution of glucose 0, 5 M, treatment temperature of 190. C for three hours. With these parameters we obtained in a reproductible way, smooth and individuals carbon spheres, with poerfect spherical morfology, mean diameters of 345 nm and standard deviation of 53 nm (what means 15 percent of dispersity). This sample, called EC, {{will be used as}} reference for the synthesis of the hybrids H 1 and H 2 and as precursor of the hybrids H 3 and H 4. In the route H 1 we added a nickel salt to the solution of glucose that is processed as the sample of reference EC. The material is formed of smooth spheres little agregated, but surprisingly with very large diameters, above 10 micrometers and with high dispersity. The EDS analysis indicate the presence of nickel and the XRD show that after a thermal treatment in argon and hidrogen atmosphere at 370. C/ 2 h apears a JCPDS profile 00 - 004 - 0850 of the metallic nanometric nickel. The final product yield was 3, 5 times more than sample EC. In the H 2 route we added metallic nickel nanoparticles (previously prepared) to the glucose solution that was processed as sample of reference EC. We obtained two different phases, one formed of smooth and individual spheres with diameters greater than 3 micrometers; the second phase formed by agregated spheres with diameters smaller than 500 nm. The EDS analysis indicated the presence of nickel in both phases and the XRD showed that after a thermal treatment in argon and hidrogen atmosphere at 370. C/ 2 h, the nickel is metallic and nanometric. Here the yield also was about 3, 5 times more than the sample EC. For the route H 3 we used the carbon spheres, sample EC, as precursor; in a dispersion of this sample, we added a nickel salt, that is converted to nickel hidroxide. This system, after sonicated and aged (to make the chemisorption of the nickel hidroxide in the spheres of the carbonaceous material), was submited to a chemical reductor. The analysis showed that nickel nanoparticles was formed, being dispersed over the surface of the carbon spheres, or being aglomerated between the carbon spheres. At last, in the route H 4 the precursor carbon spheres (sample EC) were partially wet with a nickel chloride solution, that is soon evaporated. The process is called incipient wetnessmethod, and was <b>repeted</b> many times. Nickel chloride nanocrystals was formed in the nanopores of the carbon spheres surface. After a treatment in argon, the TEM analysis showed that individual and well dispersed nickel nanocrystals was present over the surface of the carbon spheres. We also present some results of a interesting thermal treatment in a reductive atmosphere...|$|R
