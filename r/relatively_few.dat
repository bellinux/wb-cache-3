5|$|Conceived by La Gazzetta {{to boost}} its {{circulation}} {{at the expense}} of its rival Corriere della Sera, the 1909 Giro was the first stage road race. Its eight stages, although <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> compared to modern Grand Tours, were each much longer than those raced today.|$|E
5|$|Historically, <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> {{studies of}} {{learning}} and cognition have been performed on strepsirrhine primates, including ruffed lemurs. However, a study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve demonstrated that ruffed lemurs, along with several {{other members of the}} family Lemuridae, could understand the outcome of simple arithmetic operations.|$|E
5|$|The mansion where LaLaurie lived is a {{landmark}} in the French Quarter, {{in part because}} of its history and in part because there were <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> homes of such massive size in the Quarter.|$|E
50|$|The {{parallel}} {{market has}} <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> requirements, {{and is therefore}} easier for companies to list on, especially the newly established ones. The third market consists of companies that are facing financial difficulties.|$|R
30|$|Operative {{laparoscopy}} {{is employed}} widely in the UK for management of ectopic pregnancies, ovarian cysts and minor endometriosis. The more difficult procedures like total laparoscopic hysterectomies or advanced endometriosis surgeries were performed by <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> gynaecologists.|$|R
50|$|An inswinger {{presents}} <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> {{dangers to}} the batsman, but on some particular days {{can be devastating}} due to risk of being bowled or leg before wicket. Shane Bond was considered a great exponent of inswing bowling.|$|R
5|$|The raid {{was entirely}} successful. The {{airborne}} troops suffered <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> casualties, and {{the pieces of}} the radar they brought back, along with a captured German radar technician, allowed British scientists to understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures to neutralise them.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, Carr Hill has an {{approximate}} population of 3,200– 53% {{of the population}} are female, slightly above the national average, whilst 47% are male. Only 1.4% of the population are from a black or other minority ethnic group (BME), as opposed to 9.1% of the national population. <b>Relatively</b> <b>few</b> pensioners live in the suburb, 12.2% as compared to 15.9% nationally and 17.3% in the borough.|$|E
5|$|Along the Georgia coastline, The Golden Isles of Georgia were {{evacuated}} due to large swells produced by Diana. Two nursing homes in Tybee Island {{were evacuated}} and a voluntary evacuation was issued for all {{residents in the}} town. Several shelters were also opened at schools in a few counties; however, <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> families sought refuge in them. Local schools and beaches were also closed {{for the duration of}} the storm's passage.|$|E

5|$|Birmingham is chiefly {{a product}} of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries; its growth began during the Industrial Revolution. Consequently, <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> {{buildings}} survive from its earlier history and those that do are protected. There are 1,946 listed buildings in Birmingham and thirteen scheduled ancient monuments. Birmingham City Council also operate a locally listing scheme for buildings that do not fully meet the criteria for statutorily listed status.|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{programs}} were by necessity low-budget affairs, {{and the network}} received <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> awards from the TV industry. Most awards during the 1950s went to NBC and CBS, {{who were able to}} out-spend other companies and draw on their extensive history of radio broadcasting in the relatively new television medium. DuMont, however, did win a number of awards during its years of operation.|$|E
5|$|During the Bronze Age fewer {{large stone}} {{structures}} were built although the great ceremonial circles continued in use as metalworking was slowly introduced to Britain from Europe over a lengthy period. There are <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> Orcadian sites dating from this era {{although there is}} the impressive Plumcake Mound near the Ring of Brodgar and various islands sites such as Tofts Ness on Sanday {{and the remains of}} two houses on Holm of Faray.|$|E
50|$|Bass parts have <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> fast passages, double stops, {{or large}} jumps in range. These parts are usually {{given to the}} cello section, since the cello is a smaller {{instrument}} on which these techniques are more easily performed.|$|R
25|$|Unlike plant microRNAs, {{the animal}} microRNAs target diverse genes. However, genes {{involved}} in functions {{common to all}} cells, such as gene expression, have <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> microRNA target sites and seem to be under selection to avoid targeting by microRNAs.|$|R
50|$|For {{an eight-year}} period ending in 2011 Alumni Village's {{occupancy}} rate decreased, with the revenue declining 17% between 2003 and 2011. By 2014 there were <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> married students, and newer housing properties had {{opened in the}} Tallahassee area.|$|R
5|$|During the Middle Ages, the {{geography}} dictated a dispersed economy and population. As a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting feudalism. This, {{combined with the}} ready availability of wood as a building material, ensured that <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> examples of the Baroque, Renaissance, and Rococo architecture styles so often built by the ruling classes elsewhere in Europe, were constructed in Norway.|$|E
5|$|<b>Relatively</b> <b>few</b> boletes have an apical pore at {{the distal}} {{end of their}} basidiospores. The dark reddish-brown, smooth spores of Porphyrellus amylosporus are {{truncate}} with a thin-walled depression. Some species of Heimioporus have spores with apical pores, but molecular analyses demonstrate that Heimioporus is only distantly related to Spongiforma.|$|E
5|$|<b>Relatively</b> <b>few</b> {{were sold}} to the coin {{collecting}} community, {{and the majority of}} surviving specimens display the effects of careless handling. The 2015 deluxe edition of Richard S. Yeoman's A Guide Book of United States Coins lists the coin at $140 to $685, depending on condition—an exceptional piece sold for $7,050 in 2014.|$|E

5000|$|The {{amount of}} high-inclination objects {{in such a}} small sample, in which <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> high-inclination Neptune trojans are known due to {{observational}} biases, implies that high-inclination trojans may significantly outnumber low-inclination trojans. The ratio of high- to low-inclination Neptune trojans {{is estimated to be}} about 4:1. Assuming albedos of 0.05, there are an expected [...] Neptune trojans with radii above 40 km in Neptune's [...] This would indicate that large Neptune trojans are 5 to 20 times more abundant than Jupiter trojans, depending on their albedos. There may be <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> smaller Neptune trojans, which could be because these fragment more readily. Large [...] trojans are estimated to be as common as large [...] trojans.|$|R
5|$|Robert Lambourne regards Forward, {{especially}} in Dragon's Egg, as the successor of Hal Clement, whose Mission of Gravity exemplifies the most strongly science-based science fiction. In Lambourne's opinion hard science fiction authors like Clement, Forward and their successors have been <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> but have strongly influenced both the genre's evolution and the public's {{perception of the}} genre.|$|E
5|$|Team captain Cadel Evans {{provided}} {{the majority of}} their victories in 2011, most notably the overall crown at the Tour de France. Twice a runner-up at that race, and at age 34 the oldest post-World War II winner, Evans took used a different race program than he had in previous years. He rode <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> races prior to the Tour, though he was also the overall victor at Tirreno–Adriatico and the Tour de Romandie.|$|E
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to them. This {{was due to the}} <b>relatively</b> <b>few</b> locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> {{number of}} {{molecules}} {{in the gas}} phase above the interface than condensed liquid phase makes overall sum of forces applied to the surface molecule direct inside of the liquid and thus surface molecules tend to minimize their own surface area.|$|R
25|$|The {{population}} is aging in many countries, especially Japan, meaning {{that there are}} increasing numbers of elderly people to care for, but <b>relatively</b> <b>fewer</b> young people to care for them. Humans make the best carers, but where they are unavailable, robots are gradually being introduced.|$|R
