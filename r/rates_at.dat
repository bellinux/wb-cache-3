5|$|Between 1980 and 2000 the {{population}} of Gulfton increased by almost 100% without significant additional residences built. Between the 1990 U.S. Census and the 2000 Census, the counted Hispanic population in Gulfton increased from 18,422 to 33,424, an 81% increase, and the non-Hispanic White population decreased from 6,371 to 4,908, a 23% loss. Occupancy <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> many apartment complexes increased; for instance, Napoleon Square's rate increased from 60% around 1996 to over 95% in 2001. Mike McMahon, the co-founder of the Gulfton Area Neighborhood Organization (GANO), said that increased census worker efforts to ensure a more accurate population count may have {{also contributed to the}} increase.|$|E
5|$|Four Getaway Special {{payloads}} were carried. One {{studied the}} effects of cosmic rays on electronic equipment. The second studied {{the effect of the}} gas environment around the orbiter using ultraviolet absorption measurements, as a precursor to ultraviolet equipment being designed for Spacelab 2. A third, sponsored by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun newspaper, tried to use water vapor in two tanks to create snow crystals. This was a second attempt at an experiment first flown on STS-6, which had had to be redesigned after the water in the tanks froze solid. The last was similar to an experiment flown on STS-3, and studied the ambient levels of atomic oxygen by measuring the <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> which small carbon and osmium wafers oxidized.|$|E

5|$|Most useful ATP analogs {{cannot be}} hydrolyzed as ATP would be; instead they trap the enzyme in a {{structure}} {{closely related to}} the ATP-bound state. Adenosine 5′-(γ-thiotriphosphate) is an extremely common ATP analog in which one of the gamma-phosphate oxygens is replaced by a sulfur atom; this anion is hydrolyzed at a dramatically slower rate than ATP itself and functions as an inhibitor of ATP-dependent processes. In crystallographic studies, hydrolysis transition states are modeled by the bound vanadate ion. However, caution is warranted in interpreting the results of experiments using ATP analogs, since some enzymes can hydrolyze them at appreciable <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> high concentration.|$|E

A study of 467 intermediate risk patients enrolled in A3961 from 1997 to 2005 confirmed the hypothesis that therapy could be successfully reduced for this risk group. Those with favorable characteristics (tumor grade and response) received four cycles of chemotherapy, and those with unfavorable characteristics received eight cycles, with three-year event free survival and overall survival stable at 90% for the entire cohort.

5|$|Despite the {{recommendation}} for demolition, in late 1995, the councillors {{of the newly}} formed City of Perth had a feasibility study carried out into whether Council House could be refurbished. This feasibility study {{was carried out by}} Architects Cox Howlett and Bailey, of which one of the partners was the son of original designer Jeffrey Howlett, and cost $100,000. The study indicated that the building could be economically refurbished, and in December 1996 the Council unanimously agreed to press ahead with refurbishment plans, removing its asbestos and building an underground car park {{at the rear of the}} site. The decision to refurbish was helped by the fact that interest <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> the time were so low that it was cheaper to service a loan than to pay rent. At the time, the refurbishment was expected to cost around $26 million.|$|E

5|$|In 1909, Bryce {{reported}} that, between 1894 and 1908, mortality <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> some residential {{schools in}} western Canada ranged from 30% to 60% {{over five years}} (that is, five years after entry, 30% to 60% of students had died, or 6–12% per annum). These statistics did not become public until 1922, when Bryce, who was no longer working for the government, published The Story of a National Crime: Being a Record of the Health Conditions of the Indians of Canada from 1904 to 1921. In particular, he alleged that the high mortality rates {{could have been avoided}} if healthy children had not been exposed to children with tuberculosis. At the time, no antibiotic had been identified to treat the disease, and this exacerbated the impact of the illness. Streptomycin, the first effective treatment, was not introduced until 1943.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, {{the school}} adopted the General Certificate of Education, but {{students}} {{were barred from}} taking any exams {{before the age of}} 16, which meant that many students left school without any qualifications because of the sheer necessity of leaving school to contribute to household income. The system became more rational in time, but often pupils were taking O-levels and A-levels simultaneously. As of 2010, the school offers GCSEs to students in the lower school, and AS/A-levels to students in the sixth form. Under Rendall, exam pass <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> A-level increased from 67.5percent in 1970, peaking at 95percent in 1984 before decreasing slightly to 92percent in 1987. O-level/GCSE results have similarly improved, reaching a peak of 88percent pass rate in 1978. League tables published by the BBC based on 2008 A-level results rank Judd as the fourth best school in Kent. According to the BBC, in 2009 A-level students achieved an average of 999.2 QCDA points, against a national average of 739.1 and 100percent of students achieved five or more grade C results (or equivalent) at GCSE, including Maths and English. In its league table of the 500 best state secondary schools in the United Kingdom, The Sunday Times ranked The Judd School 27th.|$|E
5|$|Paleontology {{seeks to}} map out how living things have changed through time. A {{substantial}} hurdle to this aim is the difficulty of working out how old fossils are. Beds that preserve fossils typically lack the radioactive elements needed for radiometric dating. This technique is our only means of giving rocks greater than about 50 million years old an absolute age, and can be accurate to within 0.5% or better. Although radiometric dating requires very careful laboratory work, its basic principle is simple: the <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> which various radioactive elements decay are known, and so {{the ratio of the}} radioactive element to the element into which it decays shows how long ago the radioactive element was incorporated into the rock. Radioactive elements are common only in rocks with a volcanic origin, and so the only fossil-bearing rocks that can be dated radiometrically are a few volcanic ash layers.|$|E

5|$|The lactational {{amenorrhea}} method {{involves the}} use of a woman's natural postpartum infertility which occurs after delivery and may be extended by breastfeeding. This usually requires the presence of no periods, exclusively breastfeeding the infant, and a child younger than six months. The World Health Organization states that if breastfeeding is the infant's only source of nutrition, the failure rate is 2% in the six months following delivery. Six uncontrolled studies of lactational amenorrhea method users found failure <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> 6 months postpartum between 0% and 7.5%. Failure rates increase to 4–7% at one year and 13% at two years. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing, the use of a pacifier, and feeding solids all increase its failure rate. In those who are exclusively breastfeeding, about 10% begin having periods before three months and 20% before six months. In those who are not breastfeeding, fertility may return four weeks after delivery.|$|E
5|$|With {{his enemy}} {{visible from the}} deck of his {{flagship}} by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet to press on all sail {{in the hope of}} engaging the rear of the scattered French line. By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral Thomas Pasley. This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by HMS Russell, commanded by John Willett Payne, which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect. In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French first rate 110-gun Révolutionnaire exchanged places with the smaller third <b>rates</b> <b>at</b> the rear of the line and engaged the pursuing British van.
