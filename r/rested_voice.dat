5000|$|Vocal <b>rest</b> or <b>voice</b> <b>rest</b> is {{the process}} of resting the vocal folds by not {{speaking}} and singing typically following viral infections that cause hoarseness in the voice, such as the common cold or influenza or more serious vocal disorders such as chorditis or laryngitis. Vocal rest is also recommended after surgery to removal of vocal fold lesions, such as vocal fold cysts.|$|R
2500|$|In 1996, Turner {{developed}} a lesion {{on his right}} vocal cord. Turner was examined by the Vanderbilt voice clinic, where doctors advised him to let it heal on its own. Surgery was not needed, {{but he did have}} to <b>rest</b> his <b>voice</b> for a year. While Turner <b>rested</b> his <b>voice</b> back at home, he learned classical vocal technique and {{how to take care of}} his voice and avoid developing further problems. Turner states that he [...] "learned how to whistle really well during that year." ...|$|R
5000|$|Warm-up Exercises: The client can {{do these}} at home help to {{strengthen}} the voice, maintain optimal pitch and prevent vocal fatigue. <b>Resting</b> the <b>voice</b> after long periods of use is also important.|$|R
50|$|In 2008, {{just before}} {{the release of the}} album Comal County Blue, Boland {{ruptured}} a vocal cord. The injury almost caused him to lose his singing voice for good, but after surgery and <b>resting</b> his <b>voice,</b> he recovered.|$|R
5000|$|Analgesics such as non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol (acetaminophen) help in {{the management}} of pain. The Mayo Clinic advises gargling with salty warm water and <b>resting</b> the <b>voice.</b> Symptoms without active treatment usually last two to seven days.|$|R

50|$|The acute form {{generally}} {{gets better}} on its own. <b>Resting</b> the <b>voice</b> and sufficient fluids may help. Antibiotics {{generally do not}} appear to be useful in the acute form. The acute form is common while the chronic form is not. The chronic form occurs most often in middle age and is more common in men than women.|$|R
50|$|The {{budget was}} larger on the sequel {{in an attempt}} to attract a bigger audience; in {{contrast}} with the original, where only one of the ten stories was lip sync and the <b>rest</b> in <b>voice</b> over, all the stories in Fantasm Comes Again had lip sync dialogue. Ginnane later thought this was a mistake as it distracted from what was on screen.|$|R
50|$|In early 2014, he was {{diagnosed}} with vocal fold nodules. However, he decided to continue performing with NU’EST while receiving treatment. Pledis Entertainment announced in November that he would be taking a temporary hiatus from all group activities. His doctors advised that he completely <b>rest</b> his <b>voice</b> and underwent vocal cord surgery. In February 2016, it was reported that he had completely recovered.|$|R
50|$|A hoarse voice, {{also known}} as {{hoarseness}} or dysphonia, is when the voice involuntarily sounds breathy, raspy, or strained, or is softer in volume or lower in pitch. It {{can be associated with}} a feeling of unease or scratchiness in the throat. Hoarseness is often a symptom of problems in the vocal folds of the larynx. It may be caused by laryngitis, which in turn may be caused by an upper respiratory infection, a cold, or allergies. Cheering at sporting events, speaking loudly in noisy situations, talking for too long without <b>resting</b> your <b>voice,</b> singing loudly, or speaking with a voice that's too high or too low can also cause temporary hoarseness. A number of other causes for losing one's voice exist, and treatment is generally by <b>resting</b> the <b>voice</b> and treating the underlying cause. If the cause is misuse or overuse of the voice drinking plenty of water may alleviate the problems.|$|R

5000|$|Her {{third album}} [...] "Geheimen" [...] (Secrets) {{appeared}} in 1995 and went gold. She performed in shows in major Dutch theaters. With all the pressure she became exhausted {{and she needed}} to <b>rest</b> her <b>voice.</b> In February 1997 she was honored with a [...] "Golden Harp" [...] award. Two months later her album Hartslag (Heartbeat) was released. This also became a big success and she began another tour.|$|R
5000|$|The {{performance}} of Firework {{was removed from}} the setlist in shows starting from Rosemont, Illinois due to Lauren Alaina needing to <b>rest</b> her <b>voice.</b> However, it did return to the set starting with the Philadelphia PA show. Alaina did not appear in the first half in Columbus and Pittsburgh, but did appear in the second. However, she missed the Baltimore show completely, and reported that she was suffering from severe bronchitis.|$|R
50|$|His voice {{began to}} give out, and he {{developed}} calluses on his vocal cords. As a result, Rainwater and MGM Records parted ways in 1960. He went into brief retirement to <b>rest</b> his <b>voice</b> and then recorded sporadically for Warwick Records (United Kingdom), although without any hits. In the 1960s, he recorded {{for a series}} of record labels including United Artists, Warner Bros. and Sonet; and started his own record company called Brave Records.|$|R

60|$|The Left {{remained}} on the battle-field to support their champion. He went steadily on with his speech; and always it was strong, virile, felicitous, and to the point. He was earning applause, and this enabled his party to turn that fact to account. Now and then they applauded {{him a couple of}} minutes on a stretch, and during that time he could stop speaking and <b>rest</b> his <b>voice</b> without having the floor taken from him.|$|R
50|$|Michael is a {{homeless}} man who preaches in the slums of Coast City. He meets Kamimura, and helps him to find someplace to <b>rest.</b> He is <b>voiced</b> by Chris Olson. Later, in the prologue of chapter 24, he consoles Butterscotch.|$|R
60|$|The {{light was}} rapidly failing, {{but he could}} still see {{the faces of the}} men, who turned to him as though {{uncertain}} what to do. Tomlinson stood still among the <b>rest,</b> and his <b>voice</b> and attitude were both unmistakably compassionate.|$|R
50|$|Following surgery, {{patients}} {{are advised to}} <b>rest</b> their <b>voice</b> for one week with gradual re-introduction of voice use with a Speech-Language Pathologist after this period of rest. This initial rest period can vary between 2 and 14 days. Patients with subepithelial cysts have a better prognosis for timely recovery of vocal abilities than patients with ligament vocal fold cysts. Typically, patients can resume speaking activities in 7-30 days following surgery, and singing activities 30-90 days post-surgery.|$|R
25|$|Delysia {{remained}} on the stage, returning to London for Cochran's 1922 revue Mayfair and Montmartre. The show had a mixed reception, and it suffered a fatal blow when Delysia lost her voice with a throat infection and had {{to withdraw from the}} cast six weeks into the run. She was ordered by a throat specialist to <b>rest</b> her <b>voice</b> for three months. Without its star, the show failed to attract the public, and Cochran closed it after less than two months, suffering a loss of £20,000.|$|R
50|$|As {{the movie}} studio has {{continued}} to evolve, the tour has evolved along with it. In late 1989, CD players finally gave the tour guides a chance to <b>rest</b> their <b>voices.</b> In 2000, the CD players were replaced by DVD players and LCD screens, allowing the tour guides to show scenes from movies filmed at the locations which the tram passes. In 2011, Jimmy Fallon joined the tour as a video host to supplement the live-action narration and also appeared in some filming scenes.|$|R
60|$|The {{pretty girl}} who sang the soprano looked very {{interesting}} with her wet eyelashes, the tears stopped halfway in their course down her rounded cheek. The closing hymn promised endless peace and <b>rest,</b> but was <b>voiced</b> {{in the same}} tragic and hopeless music with which the service opened.|$|R
50|$|The {{script was}} an {{original}} by John Fusco, {{who had long}} been interested in blues music. He worked as a blues singer and musician but had been warned by a doctor to <b>rest</b> his <b>voice.</b> In 1981 his girlfriend, who was working at a rest home, told him that an old black man with a harmonica had been admitted. Fusco went to visit him {{and on the way}} dreamt up a story about {{what would happen if the}} player was a legendary blues player. This gave him the idea for the story.|$|R
5000|$|The year 1984 was a {{difficult}} one for Young, as his first heavy promotional and live concert tour of America strained his vocal cords severely, {{to the extent that}} he was forced to <b>rest</b> his <b>voice</b> and did not sing for much of the year. He recovered sufficiently to become involved with the Band Aid single [...] "Do They Know It's Christmas?", an all-star charity project put together by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure for Ethiopian famine relief. Young sang the opening lines of the song as a replacement for David Bowie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I must <b>rest</b> first'--and his <b>voice</b> failing, he {{laid back}} on the sofa, closed his eyes, turned ashy pale, and became so faint {{that she could not}} leave him, and was obliged to apply every {{restorative}} within reach before she could bring him back to a state of tolerable comfort.|$|R
6000|$|The {{shock of}} his {{blindness}} and {{the agony of}} the moments that had passed had finished his exhaustion. But a little longer and he must have sunk into his <b>rest.</b> But the <b>voice</b> and the help it promised rallied him for a moment. He had hardly strength to speak, {{but he managed to}} gasp out: ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the texture}} is mainly homophonic, a new rhythmic device is {{introduced}} when the choir sings [...] "dispersit superbos". As if taking instruction from the text, the choir does, in fact, divide; while all voices begin the word together, only the melodic voice continues immediately onward. The other <b>voices</b> <b>rest</b> a beat before continuing {{with the second}} syllable.|$|R
500|$|In 2012, Dinklage voiced Captain Gutt in , {{which earned}} over $877 million—his highest {{grossing}} release as of 2016. Dinklage {{has said that}} because this was his first voiceover role, he prepared himself by making sure to <b>rest</b> his <b>voice</b> before the recording sessions, and that he prefers doing roles he has not done before.

50|$|Niemann visited Wagner in the Asyl, at the composer's invitation, {{in summer}} 1858. Wagner {{had him in}} mind to create the role of Siegfried. From 1859, Wagner had {{involved}} Niemann (then at Hanover) in his plan to form a model German company to perform some operas, including Tristan und Isolde, in Paris in 1860. The plan was for Niemann to sing Tannhäuser and Josef Tichatschek to sing Lohengrin, alternating to <b>rest</b> their <b>voices</b> and able to replace each other if needed, and both to share a production of Tristan und Isolde as well. However, the projected Isolde, Frau Bürde-Ney, could not be released from a Leipzig contract, and the project foundered.|$|R

50|$|The primary {{feature of}} this cartoon series {{was the fact that}} Bud Abbott {{supplied}} the voice for his own character. Stan Irwin provided the voice of Lou Costello, who had died in 1959. The <b>rest</b> of the <b>voice</b> cast was composed of Hanna-Barbera regulars. The Canadian cartoonist, Lynn Johnston, who is famous for her comic strip, For Better or For Worse, was an uncredited cel colorist.|$|R
5000|$|The {{symptoms}} of vocal fold cysts vary but commonly include a hoarse voice and {{problems with the}} pitch of the voice. Initial treatment of the cysts involves voice therapy to reduce harmful vocal behaviours. If symptoms remain, patients may require surgery to remove the cyst. Surgery is typically followed by vocal <b>rest</b> and further <b>voice</b> therapy to restore voice function. Cysts may also be treated using vocal fold steroid injection.|$|R
60|$|They {{were passing}} between blocks of miners' dwellings. In the back yards of several dwellings, a miner {{could be seen}} washing himself in the open on this hot evening, naked down to the loins, his great {{trousers}} of moleskin slipping almost away. Miners already cleaned were sitting on their heels, with their backs near the walls, talking and silent in pure physical well-being, tired, and taking physical <b>rest.</b> Their <b>voices</b> sounded out with strong intonation, and the broad dialect was curiously caressing to the blood. It seemed to envelop Gudrun in a labourer's caress, there was in the whole atmosphere a resonance of physical men, a glamorous thickness of labour and maleness, surcharged in the air. But it was universal in the district, and therefore unnoticed by the inhabitants.|$|R
