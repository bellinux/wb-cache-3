2500|$|Cornwall {{is perhaps}} best known though for its pasties, a savoury dish made with pastry. Today's pasties usually contain a filling of beef steak, onion, potato and swede with salt and white pepper, but {{historically}} pasties had {{a variety of different}} fillings. [...] "Turmut, 'tates and mate" [...] (i.e. [...] "Turnip, potatoes and meat", turnip being the Cornish and Scottish term for swede, itself an abbreviation of 'Swedish Turnip', the British term for <b>rutabaga)</b> describes a filling once very common. For instance, the licky pasty contained mostly leeks, and the herb pasty contained watercress, parsley, and shallots. Pasties are often locally referred to as oggies. Historically, pasties were also often made with sweet fillings such as jam, apple and blackberry, plums or cherries.|$|E

40|$|This is a {{study of}} the effect which crop plants have on the growth and yields of those crops which follow. The study began in 1907; this {{bulletin}} reports the results from 1930 to 1942. Millet, mangels and <b>rutabagas</b> generally seem to be harmful to crops which follow them. Carrots, mangels and millet were least favorable of all crops to mangels. Potatoes did poorest when following potatoes, <b>rutabagas,</b> or millet. <b>Rutabagas</b> yielded low following <b>rutabagas,</b> mangels and millet. Onions were unfavorably affect by preceding crops of mangels, cabbage, or <b>rutabagas.</b> There is no simple explanation for the effect of crops on those which follow. The relationships are complex and interdependent, and are associated with the physical, chemical and microbial conditions of the soil. Well fertilized crops in moderately to strongly acid soils apparently produce unfavorable conditions for a succeeding crop for {{one or more of the}} following reasons: 1. They deplete basic nutrients with a consequent increase in H-ion concentration, accompanied by possibly harmful concentrations of aluminum or other elements. 2. Unless organic matter is provided, an adequate quantity of water stable aggregates is not maintained so that the soil becomes compact and possesses a poor physical condition unsuitable for maximum crop growth. 3. After certain crops, conditions are more favorable for the growth of plant pathogens and the development of seedling root rot. 4. The chemical, physical and biological conditions of the soil are intimately related and interdependent so that an improvement in one may produce some improvement in the other...|$|R

40|$|VP Ellipsis is {{the name}} given to {{instances}} of anaphora in which a missing predicate, like that marked by “) ” in (2), is able to find an antecedent in the surrounding discourse, as (2) does in the bracketed material of (1).
