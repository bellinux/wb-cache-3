40|$|The Immersive <b>Redliner</b> {{supports}} annotation of three-dimensional {{artifacts in}} collaborative design. It enables team members to drop annotation markers in a VRML {{world that are}} linked to comment text stored on a server. Visitors to the world later can review the design annotations in the locations where they were made. We report on two phases of the <b>Redliner</b> project: the first involves a hypothetical design scenario, the second a real application on a rehabilitation in a residence building in Strasbourg...|$|E

Over the last two years, we developed and tested two systems for collaborating designers to comment on virtual 3 D models. Our first system, <b>Redliner</b> [12] lets design team members browse and leave text annotations on surfaces in three-dimensional models. Experience with <b>Redliner,</b> including two user evaluations in different settings, led us to develop Space Pen [13], a second annotation system with improved interaction capabilities. It goes beyond the post-it note metaphor, allowing users to draw in and on the virtual environment...|$|E

This study was undertaken to improve blue-swimmer crab culture and experimentally addressed (1) prey vulnerability (2) cannibal-victim interactions, and (3) activity patterns of juveniles in varying degrees of refuge. Crabs {{used in the study}} were aged 15 weeks and sorted into two size classes; small ({{less than or equal to}} 60 mm carapace width (CW)) and large (greater than or equal to 65 mm CW) of a similar sex ratio. Vulnerability and thus survival was influenced by body size variation, moult stage and refuge availability. Crabs with carapace width less than or equal to 60 mm were more vulnerable than larger individuals, as indicated by significant differences in survival rates. As predicted, juveniles in transition stages associated with ecdysis were especially vulnerable. Premoult (<b>redliner)</b> crabs appeared to be in a high state of agitation as evidenced by the frequency of agonistic encounters and this may be a contributing factor to the high mortality observed at this critical premoult stag. increases in refuge density increased survival of juveniles proportionally, indicating that the quantity of shelter is important for reducing cannibalism in this species. Cannibal-victim interactions were frequently asymmetrical in terms of size and moult stage. Cannibals were significantly heavier than victims, and were predominantly at intermoult stage. Sexual biases among cannibals and victims were not found in this study. Activity patterns of juveniles were influenced by the experimental conditions. Crabs provided with high refuge showed reduced aggressive activity and increased time spent resting, but unchanged locomotion or feeding activity. Regular grading as well as the presence of suitable shelter for newly moulted crabs is recommended for improving culture of P. pelagicus. Research into inducing synchronous moulting may also yield promising results. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
5000|$|In the 1960s, a {{sociologist}} named John McKnight {{coined the term}} [...] "redlining" [...] to describe the discriminatory practice of fencing off areas where banks would avoid investments based on community demographics. During the heyday of redlining, the areas most frequently discriminated against were black inner city neighborhoods. For example, in Atlanta in the 1980s, a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of articles by investigative reporter Bill Dedman showed that banks would often lend to lower-income whites but not to middle- or upper-income blacks. The use of blacklists is a related mechanism also used by <b>redliners</b> {{to keep track of}} groups, areas, and people that the discriminating party feels should be denied business or aid or other transactions. In the academic literature, redlining falls under the broader category of credit rationing.|$|R
