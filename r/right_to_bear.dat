Bruno Heim says that since the cross is one heraldic emblem that only bishops have the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear,</b> cardinals who are not bishops do not use it. Notable examples are Cardinals Albert Vanhoye and Avery Dulles; the latter's arms do display a cross.|$|E
5|$|Article I {{contains}} the entire original Virginia Declaration of Rights from the 1776 Constitution. Several of the sections have been expanded to incorporate concepts from the United States Bill of Rights, {{including the right}} to due process, the prohibition against double jeopardy, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms. Like the Federal Constitution, the Virginia Bill of Rights, in §17, states that the listing of certain rights is not to be construed to exclude other rights held by the people.|$|E
5|$|Besides the Holy See, another Catholic see has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> {{the triple}} tiara in its coat of arms: the Patriarchate of Lisbon. The title of Patriarch of Lisbon {{was created in}} 1716 and is held by the {{archbishop}} of Lisbon since 1740. While the coat of arms of the Holy See combines the tiara with the crossed keys of St. Peter, that of the Lisbon Patriarchate combines it with a processional cross and a pastoral staff.|$|E

5|$|Scattered evidence, {{including}} the records in Irish annals {{and the images}} of warriors like those depicted on the Pictish stone slabs at Aberlemno, Forfarshire and Hilton of Cadboll in Easter Ross, suggest that in Northern Britain, as in Anglo-Saxon England, society was dominated by a military aristocracy, whose status was dependent in a large part on their ability and willingness to fight. Below {{the level of the}} aristocracy it is assumed that there were non-noble freemen, working their own small farms or holding lands as free tenants. There are no surviving law codes from Scotland in this period, but codes in Ireland and Wales indicate that freemen had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms, represent themselves in law and to receive compensation for murdered kinsmen.|$|E
5|$|Scottish {{society in}} the Middle Ages is the social {{organisation}} {{of what is now}} Scotland between the departure of the Romans from Britain in the fifth century and the establishment of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Social structure is obscure {{in the early part of}} the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship groups probably provided the primary system of organisation and society was probably divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners.|$|E
5|$|In December 1689, Parliament passed one of {{the most}} {{important}} constitutional documents in English history, the Bill of Rights. This measure—which restated and confirmed many provisions of the earlier Declaration of Right—established restrictions on the royal prerogative; it declared, among other things, that the Sovereign could not suspend laws passed by Parliament, levy taxes without parliamentary consent, infringe the right to petition, raise a standing army during peacetime without parliamentary consent, deny the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms to Protestant subjects, unduly interfere with parliamentary elections, punish members of either House of Parliament for anything said during debates, require excessive bail, or inflict cruel or unusual punishments. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William III or Mary II, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Mary's sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage.|$|E

5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} is obscure {{in the early}} part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources. Kinship probably provided the primary unit of organisation and society was divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare, a wider group of freemen, who had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms and were represented in law codes, above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners. By the thirteenth century there are have sources that allow greater stratification in society to be seen, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen with more modest landholdings.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the region fell to the Ottoman Turks shortly after 1369 and the coastal towns were conquered in 1453. Under Ottoman rule, many villages provided auxiliaries to the Ottoman army or had to protect the mountain passes and therefore enjoyed a more favourable status— they paid no taxes and the men had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>bear</b> arms. There were 17 privileged villages in {{the territory of the}} modern park where Muslims were not allowed to settle. During the time of internal disorder in the Ottoman Empire in 1785–1810, brigand bands wreaked havoc in Strandzha resulting in the migration of thousands of people. Another massive migration wave followed the Russo-Turkish War (1828–29) and many Bulgarians settled in the southern areas of the Russian Empire. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Strandzha remained outside the borders of the reborn state. In July 1903 in the historic area Petrova Niva the delegates of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) discussed the outbreak of an anti-Ottoman rebellion. The Ilinden–Preobrazhenie Uprising broke out in Strandzha and Macedonia in August 1903 and lasted for about twenty days before being suppressed by the Turks who committed great atrocities to the local population. Over 60 villages were burned down and thousands were massacred. Strandzha was liberated during the First Balkan War (1912–1913) and formally joined Bulgaria after the Second Balkan War in 1913.|$|E
