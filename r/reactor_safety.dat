5|$|After the Oppenheimer controversy, Teller became ostracized by {{much of the}} {{scientific}} community, but was still quite welcome in the government and military science circles. Along with his traditional advocacy for nuclear energy development, a strong nuclear arsenal, and a vigorous nuclear testing program, he had helped to develop nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>safety</b> standards as {{the chair of the}} Reactor Safeguard Committee of the AEC in the late 1940s, and in the late 1950s headed an effort at General Atomics which designed research reactors in which a nuclear meltdown would be impossible. The TRIGA (Training, Research, Isotopes, General Atomic) has been built and used in hundreds of hospitals and universities worldwide for medical isotope production and research.|$|E

50|$|A unique {{feature of}} Hope Creek is its {{cylindrical}} reactor building {{complete with a}} dome which makes it appear similar to a pressurized water reactor containment building which is not typical of boiling water reactors. However this similarity is limited to appearance. Like other BWRs, the actual containment vessel for the reactor is a separate drywell/torus structure enclosed within the reactor building, but structurally separate.

25|$|A {{number of}} nuclear <b>reactor</b> <b>safety</b> system lessons {{emerged from the}} incident. The most obvious was that in tsunami-prone areas, a power station's sea wall must be {{adequately}} tall and robust. At the Onagawa Nuclear Power Plant, closer to the epicenter of 11 March earthquake and tsunami, the sea wall was 14meters tall and successfully withstood the tsunami, preventing serious damage and radioactivity releases.|$|E
25|$|As head of Naval Reactors, Rickover's {{focus and}} {{responsibilities}} were dedicated to <b>reactor</b> <b>safety</b> rather than tactical or strategic submarine warfare training. However, this extreme focus {{was well known}} during Rickover's era as a potential hindrance to balancing operational priorities. One way by which this was addressed after the admiral retired was that only the very strongest, former at-sea submarine commanders have held Rickover's now unique eight-year position as NAVSEA-08, the longest chartered tenure in the U.S. military. From Rickover's first replacement, Kinnaird R. McKee, to today's head of Naval Reactors, James F. Caldwell, Jr., all have held command of nuclear submarines, their squadrons and ocean fleets, but not one has been a long-term Engineering Duty Officer such as Rickover.|$|E
25|$|Decay heat {{accidents}} are where the heat {{generated by the}} radioactive decay causes harm. In a large nuclear reactor, a {{loss of coolant accident}} can damage the core: for example, at Three Mile Island a recently shutdown (SCRAMed) PWR reactor was left for a length of time without cooling water. As a result, the nuclear fuel was damaged, and the core partially melted. The removal of the decay heat is a significant <b>reactor</b> <b>safety</b> concern, especially shortly after shutdown. Failure to remove decay heat may cause the reactor core temperature to rise to dangerous levels and has caused nuclear accidents. The heat removal is usually achieved through several redundant and diverse systems, and the heat is often dissipated to an 'ultimate heat sink' which has a large capacity and requires no active power, though this method is typically used after decay heat has reduced to a very small value. The main cause of release of radioactivity in the Three Mile Island accident was a pilot-operated relief valve on the primary loop which stuck in the open position. This caused the overflow tank into which it drained to rupture and release large amounts of radioactive cooling water into the containment building.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the west}} began {{to learn about}} the Chernobyl incident, fear and anxiety about nuclear energy swelled in U.S. public opinion. Even as early as 1975, anti-nuclear {{movement}} coalitions were making strides in reducing the power of the nuclear industry. The coalitions were able to instill fear in the population over the many errors in the daily operations of nuclear energy plants, causing them to be constantly shut down, and exposing the ineffectiveness in their energy production. By this point, in the late 1980s, most U.S. plants were either at or close to completion, so the Chernobyl incident did not prevent plants from coming online. However, after 1986, anti-nuclear messages were reinforced by media pictures of deformed babies and other atrocities from the fallout in the Soviet Union after Chernobyl. Citizen pressure forced the NRC to address many issues alarming the public, resulting in [...] "improved <b>reactor</b> <b>safety,</b> reporting abnormal occurrences at power plants, revised radiation standards, protecting nuclear plants from sabotage, safeguarding nuclear materials from theft, licensing the export of nuclear equipment and fuel, authorizing steps to use plutonium as fuel for nuclear power, and other matters." [...] Shortly after the 1979 Three Mile Island incident, a poll by The New York Times and CBS found that public approval for building new nuclear plants dropped from 69% to 49% and opposition increased from 21% to 41%. Similarly, after the Chernobyl incident, a CBS news poll showed that 55% of those questioned believed a similar meltdown was likely to happen in the U.S.|$|E

Nevertheless, the European Commission considers the future of nuclear energy in Europe uncertain, because it depends not only on energy demand and environmental issues but also on nuclear <b>reactor’s</b> <b>safety</b> and waste problem. The most EU countries have imposed legal or policy restrictions on building nuclear power plants, some of them have made decisions to phase out the use of nuclear power.

50|$|Despite the {{concerns}} which arose {{among the public}} after the Three Mile Island incident, the accident highlights {{the success of the}} <b>reactor's</b> <b>safety</b> systems. The radioactivity released {{as a result of the}} accident was almost entirely confined within the reinforced concrete containment structure. These containment structures, found at all nuclear power plants, were designed to successfully trap radioactive material in the event of a melt down or accident. At Three Mile Island, the containment structures operated exactly as it was designed to do, emerging successful in containing any radioactive energy. The low levels of radioactivity released post incident is considered harmless, resulting in zero injuries and deaths of residents living in proximity to the plant.|$|R
