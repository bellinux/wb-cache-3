A small number of nomadic Tibetan graziers or Dokpas [...] herd yak, sheep and pashmina-type goats in the region. There has been intense grazing pressure due to domestic and wild herbivores on the land. Yaks are found in these parts, and in many hamlets they serve as beasts of burden. The region around Nathu La contains many endangered species, including Tibetan gazelle, snow leopard, Tibetan wolf, Tibetan snowcock, lammergeier, raven, golden eagle, and <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelduck.</b> Feral dogs are considered a major hazard in this region. The presence of landmines in the area causes casualties among yak, nayan, kiang, and Tibetan wolf.|$|E
2500|$|Every year {{approximately}} 15,000 greater flamingos {{are reported}} to visit the lake along with pelicans, kingfishers, herons, painted storks, spoonbills and ducks. The highest concentrations of flamingo {{are found in the}} periphery of the lagoon where the water level is below. The concentrations of flamingos are also associated with high algal, fish and benthic diversity. Other water birds in the area include spot-billed pelican, seven species of herons and egrets, painted stork, greater flamingos, ducks, [...] 20 species of shorebirds, gulls, terns, little grebe, Indian cormorant, little cormorant, Asian openbill stork, black-headed ibis, Eurasian spoonbill, lesser whistling teal, spotbill duck, great thick-knee and stone curlew. Several species of wintering waterfowl have been noted including bar-headed goose, <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelduck,</b> Eurasian wigeon, common teal, northern pintail, garganey, northern shoveller, common pochard, brown-headed gull, black-headed gull, whiskered tern, gull-billed tern and Caspian tern. Birds of prey which appear in winter are the: white-bellied sea eagle, harriers and peregrine falcons. The largest concentrations of flamingos occur in the Andhra Pradesh part of the sanctuary, around the islands of Vendadu and Irukkam.|$|E
50|$|Although {{becoming}} quite rare {{in southeast}} Europe and southern Spain, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelduck</b> is still common {{across much of}} its Asian range. It may be this population which gives rise to vagrants as far west as Iceland, Great Britain and Ireland. However, since the European population is declining, {{it is likely that}} most occurrences in western Europe in recent decades are escapes or feral birds. Although this bird is observed in the wild {{from time to time in}} eastern North America, no evidence has been found that this is a genuine case of vagrancy. Feral <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelduck</b> have bred successfully in several European countries. In Switzerland the <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelduck</b> is considered an invasive species that threatens to displace native birds.

50|$|The <b>ruddy</b> <b>{{shelduck}}</b> (Tadorna ferruginea) is {{a member}} of the shelduck genus Tadorna; in the wildfowl family Anatidae. The bird was first described in 1764 by the German zoologist and botanist Peter Simon Pallas who named it Anas ferruginea, but later it was transferred to the genus Tadorna with the other shelducks. Some authorities place it in the genus Casarca along with the South African shelduck (T. cana), the Australian shelduck (T. tadornoides) and the Paradise shelduck (T. variegata). Phylogenetic analysis shows that it is most closely related to the South African shelduck. In captivity, the <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelduck</b> has been known to hybridise with several other members of Tadorna, with several members of the dabbling duck genus Anas, and with the Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiaca). No subspecies are recognised.|$|E
40|$|Background: Identifying {{movement}} {{routes and}} stopover sites {{is necessary for}} developing effective management and conservation strategies for migratory animals. In the case of migratory birds, a collection of migration routes, known as a flyway, is often hundreds to thousands of kilometers long and can extend across political boundaries. Flyways encompass the entire geographic range between the breeding and non-breeding areas of a population, species, {{or a group of}} species, and they provide spatial frameworks for management and conservation across international borders. Existing flyway maps are largely qualitative accounts based on band returns and survey data rather than observed movement routes. In this study, we use satellite and GPS telemetry data and dynamic Brownian bridge movement models to build upon existing maps and describe waterfowl space use probabilistically in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. Results: Our approach provided new information on migratory routes that was not easily attainable with existing methods to describe flyways. Utilization distributions from dynamic Brownian bridge movement models identified key staging and stopover sites, migration corridors and general flyway outlines in the Central Asian and East Asian-Australasian Flyways. A map of space use from <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelducks</b> depicted two separate movement corridors within the Central Asian Flyway, likely representing two distinct populations that show relatively strong connectivit...|$|R
5000|$|The crested {{shelduck}} {{has never been}} numerous in modern times, though it {{is thought to have}} been more widespread historically due to its presence in Japanese aviculture. The species is known from only a handful of sightings and some retroactively declared it extinct in 1916 after a female was shot at Busan, South Korea. In 1943, a sighting of this bird was reported near Chungcheongbukdo, building hopes that the species persisted. A group of three birds, two females and a male, was sighted by two Russian students in 1964 in the Rimsky-Korsakov Archipelago near Vladivostok with a small flock of harlequin ducks. In 1971 it was reported from North Korea's northeast coast and in 1985 two were reported from eastern Russia. However, there are severe doubts about the accuracy of the 1971 record. A recent survey of Chinese hunters resulted in a number of unconfirmed reports from northeastern China. For example, a Chinese forest worker claimed that he unknowingly ate two in 1984. There are also unconfirmed reports of about twenty {{crested shelduck}}s in the Dashanbao region of Yunnan, though many believe this flock to be a misidentified flock of <b>ruddy</b> <b>shelducks.</b> It is believed that, if the species survives, there likely are fewer than 50 individuals.|$|R
40|$|Highly {{pathogenic}} {{avian influenza}} virus (H 5 N 1) (QH 09) was isolated from dead wild birds (3 species) in Qinghai, China, during May–June 2009. Phylogenetic and antigenic analyses showed that QH 09 was clearly distinguishable from classical clade 2. 2 viruses and belonged to clade 2. 3. 2. In May 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (H 5 N 1) caused a disease outbreak in wild {{birds in the}} Qinghai Lake region of the People’s Republic of China (1). Subsequently, this virus (QH 05, clade 2. 2) disseminated from Asia to Europe and Africa, {{which has led to}} great concern and energetic debates about the role of migratory birds in influenza epidemics (1 – 5). In 2006, this virus was detected in migratory birds in Qinghai (6, 7). In 2007, viruses similar to QH 05 were isolated from surveyed anseriformes in Qinghai and showed only a short evolutionary distance from earlier viruses (8). Genetic diversity of avian influenza viruses (H 5 N 1) was not detected in wild birds in Qinghai before 2008 (7, 8). We report evidence that a second lineage of viruses, in addition to clade 2. 2, has emerged in wild birds in Qinghai.

40|$|Abstract Background Since the {{emergence}} of H 5 N 1 high pathogenicity (HP) avian influenza virus (AIV) in Asia, numerous efforts worldwide have focused on elucidating the relative roles of wild birds and domestic poultry movement in virus dissemination. In accordance with this a surveillance program for AIV in wild birds was conducted in Mongolia from 2005 - 2007. An important feature of Mongolia {{is that there is}} little domestic poultry production in the country, therefore AIV detection in wild birds would not likely be from spill-over from domestic poultry. Results During 2005 - 2007 2, 139 specimens representing 4, 077 individual birds of 45 species were tested for AIV by real time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) and/or virus isolation. Bird age and health status were recorded. Ninety rRT-PCR AIV positive samples representing 89 individual birds of 19 species including 9 low pathogenicity (LP) AIVs were isolated from 6 species. A Bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), a Whooper swan (Cygnus cygnus) and 2 <b>Ruddy</b> <b>shelducks</b> (Tadorna ferruginea) were positive for H 12 N 3 LP AIV. H 16 N 3 and H 13 N 6 viruses were isolated from Black-headed gulls (Larus ridibundus). A Red-crested pochard (Rhodonessa rufina) and 2 Mongolian gulls (Larus vagae mongolicus) were positive for H 3 N 6 and H 16 N 6 LP AIV, respectively. Full genomes of each virus isolate were sequenced and analyzed phylogenetically and were most closely related to recent European and Asian wild bird lineage AIVs and individual genes loosely grouped by year. Reassortment occurred within and among different years and subtypes. Conclusion Detection and/or isolation of AIV infection in numerous wild bird species, including 2 which have not been previously described as hosts, reinforces the wide host range of AIV within avian species. Reassortment complexity within the genomes indicate the introduction of new AIV strains into wild bird populations annually, however there is enough over-lap of infection for reassortment to occur. Further work is needed to clarify how AIV is maintained in these wild bird reservoirs. </p...|$|R
