40|$|The Swedish energy {{companies}} have several different systems {{for data collection}} of the energy consumption of their clients. Often computerized <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> readers are put in practice in order to register the energy consumption of large companies. The majority of household clients, however, are read off by the assistance of manual methods. Household power consumption is read off once a year. As a result, these clients are not debited for their actual consumption; their invoices during the year {{are the result of}} estimations. At times when the electricity supply system is highly loaded, electricity is more expensive. Nevertheless all clients are billed with an average price. Many clients are dissatisfied with this situation. A large number of clients find it difficult to understand their invoices and demand them to be made easier to understand and to contain a specification of actual energy consumption. The Swedish Gov. wants {{energy companies}} to decrease the number of power peak loads and so new regulations concerning more frequent meter readings will probably be put in practice. In this essay different kinds of methods are described for data collection with the purpose of finding out which method power companies in Sweden should adopt in the future. Computerized systems that power companies could use are for example CustCom, Mcom and BBIF 20. These systems are based on hourly <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> readings, monthly <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> readings and hourly <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> readings combined with certain control functions. Finally it is recommended that power companies in Sweden should introduce hourly <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> readings on all the power consumption provided that new regulations concerning more frequent meter readings are put into practice...|$|R

40|$|A fast {{shift is}} taking place in Sweden and in other {{countries}} from manual meter reading at irregular intervals, to automatic <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> reading at pre-defined instants. <b>Remote</b> <b>meter</b> reading {{is an essential part of}} a well-functioning electricity market, but the transmission of large numbers of readings (millions for some network operators) poses serious technical challenges. Different communication channels have been tried, but the power grid is the one that is in any case always available at places where electricity has to be metered. The power grid is however not designed as a communication channel; high disturbance levels and attenuation may occur. The main concern is the as yet unpredictable character of both disturbance and attenuation. The widespread use of the power grid as a communication channel (as will likely be the case with <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> reading) may also lead to interference with other equipment. This paper will give a general overview of the potential problems associated with remote-meter reading via the power grid and describe some of the technologies available.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} {{the findings of}} the study to d e v e l o p a Data Acquisition System (DAS) of bulk supply consumers using a feasible <b>remote</b> <b>metering</b> (RM) option {{that can be used in}} distribution sector. The most of the utilities in developed countries have gained the access to their meters remotely. Not only in electricity sector, but also it is used in gas and water metering as well. This has many advantages over conventional point to point meter reading. The accuracy and low cost are straight forward benefits that the utility c a n obtain with these systems. Without confining merely to a <b>remote</b> <b>metering</b> (RM) system, this c a n be further d e v e l o p e d to a d a t a acquisition system, which is immensely useful not only to the utility but also to the other stake holders of the electricity industry such as to academic institutions, regulatory bodies, investors, consumers, etc. The basic requirement here is to select appropriate communication medium and to parameterize the metering and other equipment such as modems, etc accordingly to log the required system parameters. The Colombo City distribution province of Ceylon Electricity Board was selected for this research. The data logging capability and communication facilities of different types of energy meters were studied.

40|$|Abstract—Electricity {{consumer}} dishonesty is {{a problem}} faced by all power utilities. Finding efficient measurements for detecting fraudulent electricity consumption has been an active research area in recent years. This paper presents an approach towards detection of Non-technical Losses (NTLs) of Large Power Consumers (LPC) in Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Malaysia. The main motivation {{of this study is}} to assist Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) Sdn. Bhd. in Malaysia to reduce its NTLs in the LPC distribution sector. <b>Remote</b> <b>meters</b> installed at premises of LPC customers transmit power consumption data including <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> events wirelessly to TNB Metering Services Sdn. Bhd. The <b>remote</b> <b>meter</b> reading (RMR) consumption data for TNB LPC customers is recorded based on half-hourly intervals. The technique proposed in this paper correlates the half-hourly RMR consumption data with abnormal meter events. The correlated data provides information regarding consumption characteristics i. e. load profiles of LPC customers, which helps to expose abnormal consumption behavior that is known to be highly correlated with NTL activities and electricity theft. Pilot testing results obtained from TNB Distribution (TNBD) Sdn. Bhd. for onsite inspection of LPC customers in peninsular Malaysia indicate the proposed NTL detection technique is effective with a 55 % detection hitrate. With the implementation of this intelligent system, NTL activities of LPC customers in TNB Malaysia will reduce significantly. Keywords—Nontechnical loss, Electricity theft; Fuzzy logic...|$|R
