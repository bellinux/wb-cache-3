5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} the <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> what the author (and many others) consider {{case studies of}} censorship in the U.S., including {{a decision by the}} Supreme Court of the United States against naked erotic dancing, laws against pornography in the 1980s supported by proponents Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, and attempts by the Meese Commission to discourage proprietors from selling Penthouse and Playboy magazines.|$|E
5|$|As an example, the {{execution}} scene in The Kingdom of This World puts European and autochthonous cultures in opposition {{through the use}} of the spectator-performer relationship. In this spectacle situation, Carpentier is able to juxtapose the Europeans' experience of Macandal's body falling into the flames with the autochthonous (Afro-Haitian) experience of Macandal's body flying off the stake. Through the different, mutable views of the performance that he creates, Carpentier is able to represent an unstable cultural identity. As a second example, the scene that Ti Noel constructs around himself after the sacking of the Sans-Souci Palace presents the <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> a dramatic rehearsal in which Ti Noel represents culturally mobile subjectivity by performing different identities on his own.|$|E
5|$|Hall had {{no special}} {{academic}} background or sailing experience (he was a blacksmith, engraver, then {{owner of a}} Cincinnati newspaper), {{but he was a}} voracious <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> an obsession for the Arctic. After John Franklin's 1845 expedition was lost, Hall's focus was directed toward the Arctic. He was able to launch two expeditions in search of Franklin and his crew; one in 1860–63, and a second in 1864–69. These experiences established him as a seasoned Arctic explorer, and gave him valuable contacts among the Inuit people. The renown he gained eventually allowed him to convince the United States government to fund his third expedition, an attempt on the North Pole.|$|E
30|$|Consistent {{with the}} finding by Chapman and Tunmer ([1995]) that {{the extent to}} which {{students}} perceive themselves to be <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high proficiency or <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency influences the reading prowess of “normal” children, the Hong Kong SAR primary school children’s self-concept about reading {{was a significant predictor of}} whether they might be <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high proficiency or <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency. Similarly, highly self-sufficient students who had positive feelings and confidence about reading were found to form the majority of <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high proficiency, whereas students who lacked confidence in their reading were less likely to steer themselves away from being <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency towards being <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high proficiency.|$|R
50|$|A {{deficit in}} naming speed is {{hypothesized}} {{to represent a}} deficit that is separate from phonological processing deficit. Wolf identified four types of readers: <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> no deficits, <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> phonological processing deficit, <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> naming speed deficit, and <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> double deficit (that is, problems both with phonological processing and naming speed). Students with double deficits {{are most likely to}} have some sort of severe reading impairment.|$|R
30|$|Multilevel logit {{regression}} model {{was used to}} examine the combined influences of the affective factors, home environment, and school environment on the probabilities of students being <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high proficiency and <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency. Multilevel logit regression analysis was chosen to address the research questions, given that the dependent variable was a categorical variable with three categories—readers with high proficiency, average <b>readers,</b> and <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency (Hox [1995]).|$|R
5|$|Sex, Sin, and Blasphemy {{provides}} the <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> {{a history of}} censorship of artworks. The book argues that artists have been scapegoated by those advocating censorship, {{as a method of}} diverting debate away from the suppression of human rights. The author asserts that censorship of works deemed obscene {{has been used as a}} tactic throughout history to suppress women's rights. Heins describes for the reader the history of the 1873 Comstock laws. It's stated that,"such laws were put forth by United States Postal Inspection Service inspector Anthony Comstock, and after he helped influence passage of the legislation, they enabled the government to criminalize sending perceived immoral writings through the mail".|$|E
5|$|A common {{interpretation}} of Either/Or presents the <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> {{a choice between}} two approaches to life. There are no standards or guidelines which indicate how to choose. The reasons for choosing an ethical way of life over the aesthetic only make sense if one is already committed to an ethical way of life. Suggesting the aesthetic approach as evil implies one has already accepted {{the idea that there}} is a good/evil distinction to be made. Likewise, choosing an aesthetic way of life only appeals to the aesthete, ruling Judge Vilhelm's ethics as inconsequential and preferring the pleasures of seduction. Thus, existentialists see Victor Eremita as presenting a radical choice in which no pre-ordained value can be discerned. One must choose, and through one's choices, one creates what one is.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{with the}} {{founding}} of the CIA in 1947 as the successor to the Office of Strategic Services, the author provides the <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> a chronological overview of the agency's history. He documents the CIA's involvement in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, and provides a biographical assessment of the motivations of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Iranian leader deposed in the coup. In briefly describing individuals, organizations and events related to the history of the CIA, Smith notes Russian intelligence Colonel Vilyam Genrikhovich Fisher (Rudolf Ivanovich Abel), and discusses the U.S. intelligence operation that used a front company called Zenith Technical Enterprises. The chronological presentation of CIA history is used to provide additional background with regard to the agency's involvement with the War on Terror. The encyclopedia's chronology ends in March 2003.|$|E

30|$|The above {{findings}} suggest that reading attitudes, reading motivation, and reading self-concept have different impacts on low-proficiency readers and high-proficiency readers. Home and school environments likewise appear to have different influences on the reading outcomes of <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low reading proficiency and <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high reading proficiency.|$|R

30|$|As we anticipated, reading {{motivation}} {{played a}} different role in predicting <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency and <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> high proficiency. Like reading attitude, reading motivation did not predict <b>readers</b> <b>with</b> low proficiency {{in the present}} study, a finding which suggests that low reading motivation {{may not be a}} factor of poor reading performance. The association between reading motivation and reading performance among poor readers in previous research (e.g., Lepola et al. [2000]) may reflect the possibility that low reading motivation is a consequence rather than a cause of poor reading performance.|$|R

25|$|Stephen King {{provides}} the <b>reader</b> <b>with</b> {{a great deal}} of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story, including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells.

In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him.|$|E
