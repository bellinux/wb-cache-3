Function tables were connected to function panels using heavy black cables. Each function table had 728 <b>rotating</b> <b>knobs.</b> Programming the ENIAC also involved setting some of the 3,000 switches. Debugging a program took a week. The ENIAC featured parallel operations. Different sets of accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms.

It ran for eight years, calculating hydrogen bomb parameters, predicting weather patterns, and producing firing tables to aim artillery guns.|$|R
5000|$|The lever {{extends to}} the right from a {{vertical}} control shaft. The lever has a neutral position with the lever extended directly {{to the right of}} the pivot. Braking is applied by progressively rotating the lever clockwise, which, due to the position of the level relative to the pivot, is actuated by the operator moving their hand closer to the body - to the [...] "rear". Forward traction is added by rotating the lever counter-clockwise, or [...] "forward". As the lever translates linear motion by the operator into rotary motion of the lever, the level is normally topped with a <b>rotating</b> <b>knob</b> at the right end. This allows the operator to slide the lever without twisting their wrist. The controller often also incorporates a fail-safe device (or dead man's switch) that requires constant downward pressure once the lever is rotated forward from the neutral position. Releasing the lever causes it to pop up on a spring, activating emergency braking.|$|E

40|$|How do we {{represent}} numbers and make mathematical calculations? This {{question is the}} main focus of the present work and it falls in the domain of mathematical cognition, the field of knowledge concerned with the cognitive and neurological processes that underline mathematical abilities. The mental number line, with its analogue left-to-right orientation of growing numerical values, is often regarded as the best candidate to the role of mental representation of numbers. Many studies have examined the so-called mental number line taking the Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect as evidence for a unique connection between space and number. However, left-to-right orientation has been shown to extend to other dimensions, including duration and physical size. Such observations converge with the notion of a general magnitude system, where different magnitudes share neural and conceptual resources. This rise an important question {{about the nature of the}} information represented along the mental number line: is it exclusive to number or not? The present work is divided in 4 chapters. Chapter 1 addresses several issues in mental representations of numbers. Research in mathematical cognition has a long history and has made considerable progress over the last decades; sometimes this big volume of data makes it difficult to gain a global view of what the state-of-the-art is. For this reason, Chapter 1 will offer an overview of the different mental representations of numbers, whether innate or acquired, precise or approximate, symbolic or non symbolic. On the one hand, the most important insight gained on mental representations of numbers are listed; on the other, literature on the representation of time, space, number and intensity, related with number representation, are revised to show the similarities between these domains, and how those are indicative of common processing mechanisms. The theoretical background specific for the present work is introduced. A great body of evidences point out that the representation and processing of numbers is associated to an activation of spatial codes. One of the classical view of numerical cognition on this subject states that spatial codes are an imprescindible component of the long-term representation of numerical magnitude information. According to this idea, refereed to as number mental line hypothesis, numbers are systematically associated to spatial codes, as if numerical magnitudes were represented along a spatial continuum with small numbers to the left and large numbers to the right. Nevertheless, the origin of the association between numbers and space is not completely clear to date. Studies will be presented showing that the spatial coding of numbers is not stable and is not necessarily the result of long-term memory associations but, on the contrary, a flexible type of representation built during cognitive processing as the result of task demands and spatial coding preferences. Moreover, studies on the association of numbers with others, non-spatial, magnitudes will be reviewed. In Chapter 2 a series of three studies are presented, in all of them a numerosity production method of response was used. Participants performed approximate arithmetic task on symbolically presented numbers, they were instructed to respond by the production of a dot pattern, the set size of which was controlled by a <b>rotating</b> <b>knob.</b> Study 1 shows two experiments in which participants judged the average numerosity between two sequentially presented dot patterns. In Experiment 1, the response was given on a 0 – 20 numerical scale (categorical scaling), and in Experiment 2, the response was given by the production of a dot pattern of the desired numerosity numerosity production). Data showed that responses were shaped according to an averaging integration model. This suggests the linearity in the response scale of both of the response methods in the approximate arithmetic task. More important, the two operands were found to have the same influence in determining the result. These two experiments served as a validation tool of the numerosity production method of response to be applied in the sequent studies. Study 2 proposes one experiment using the numerosity production method of response to test the influence of the force required to respond on the Operational Momentum (OM) effect. The OM effect is the finding of a systematic tendency to overestimate the results of addition problems and underestimate the results of subtraction problems under conditions that prevent exact calculation. In this experiment the force required to turn the knob has been manipulated in three between subjects blocks. It has been suggested that the OM effect depend on the spatial representation of numbers; by showing that the elimination of psycho-motor feedback nullifies the difference between addition and subtraction, evidence are provided that the OM effect is modulated by information from a magnitude different from space (required force), even when such information is entirely task-irrelevant. Study 3 proposes an experiment on the comparison of four different effects classically considered examples of the automatic spatial organization of numerical information. The spatial-numerical association of response codes (SNARC), that is, the tendency to be faster in responding to small numbers on the left and to bigger number on the right. The distance effect, that is, close numbers are more difficult to compare than numbers far apart. The size congruency effect, that is, numbers are identified more rapidly as bigger or smaller than 5 if their physical size is congruent with the correct answer. And last but not least, the OM effect. Those effects have been tested together to investigate the relationship among them with an inter-individual differences approach. The presence of all the effects object of this study was verified in the participants set. Linear regression have been used to calculate the coefficient of each subject for each effect in order to test the correlation between all the effects this study take into consideration. The result of this study, even if not conclusive, point in the direction of a common representational mechanism underling the tested numerical effects (SNARC, size congruency, distance). Moreover, the operational bias seem to have a negative correlation only with the SNARC effect, suggesting a connection between the two, but weekending the mental number line account of those effects. In Chapter 3 conclusions are drawn upon the presented experimental work taking into account different explanatory frameworks. The present research work use a relatively unknown method of response to numerical tasks; the numerosity production method of response. This method shows a wide range of applications and opens new scenarios in mathematical cognition, providing a good instrument to understand in detail the implications of action in mathematical cognition. Moreover, the experiments here presented provide clear indications for a role of non-spatial psycho-motor feedback in arithmetical calculations carried out with the numerosity production method of response, thus challenging the classical interpretation of OM as an effect derived from a purely spatial representation of numbers. Moreover, considering that the force information was presented haptically but numerical information visually, such integration across sensory modalities is consistent with the General magnitude system hypothesis suggesting that representations of magnitudes are multimodal. Study 3 comparing, at our knowledge for the first time, different effects connected to the mental number line hypothesis, provide new insight on the shared processing undergoing these classical findings of mathematical cognition. Our findings, although not conclusive, renew the question on the nature of the representation of numbers...|$|E

Boys in the 7 - 8 -year-old group were faster when mentally and manually rotating in the same direction than in the opposite direction. For girls and older children this effect was not found. A positive relationship was found between motor ability and accuracy on the mental rotation task: stronger motor ability related to improved mental rotation performance. In both age groups, children with more advanced motor abilities were more likely to adopt motor processes to solve mental rotation tasks if the mental rotation task was primed by a motor task. Our evidence supports the idea that an overlap between motor and visual cognitive processes in children is influenced by motor ability...|$|R
50|$|Other {{studies have}} tried to {{understand}} the ACE phenomenon by examining the modulation of motor resonance during language comprehension. In one study {{participants were asked to}} read sentences containing a frame of between one and three words. The participants had to <b>rotate</b> a <b>knob,</b> in one direction for half of the experiment and in the other direction for the other half. Each 5° of rotation induced the presentation of a new frame. Each of the sentences described actions involving manual rotation. In these, the rotation direction would or would not match the rotation direction implied by the sentence. Earlier studies, such as that by Glenberg & Kaschak (2002), examined motor resonance in responses to sentences presumably given after the sentence was read. In contrast, results of this study revealed that motor resonance had dissipated {{before the end of the}} sentence, with motor resonance occurring on the verb. This study made use of comprehension questions rather than sensibility sentences. The researchers have argued that this created a more naturalistic reading situation, so it could be argued that the results of this study are deemed more suitable because they are in regards to more naturalistic language. Overall, the researchers have concluded that motor resonance is quite immediate and short-lived and that duration of the effect is modified by linguistic context.|$|R

A simple slide bolt with a knob has a very direct mapping, whereas, one with a rotating lever requires the understanding of the transformation of the rotation translated into the movement of the bolt horizontally. From this perspective, mapping is a characterstic of affordance.

We make use of a neural network approach to generate manipulation trajectories for a robot. An instruction in natural language and a pointcloud of the 'manipulatable' object part are encoded into a compact feature representation. We use a recurrent neural network to generate a manipulation trajectory, conditioned on this learned feature representation. We report on experimental results with our model, first letting our recurrent neural network hallucinate manipulation trajectories. This shows that it has learned reasonable patterns.

In the present EEG study we investigated the neural and temporal dynamics of action planning in participants with right-sided HCP (n= 10) and in left-handed control subjects (n= 10). An anticipatory planning task was used in which participants were required to grasp and <b>rotate</b> a hexagonal <b>knob</b> over different angles (60 degrees, 120 degrees or 180 degrees). At a behavioral level, participants with HCP were slower in their movements and often selected an inappropriate grip when grasping the object. At a neural level, individuals with HCP showed a strong reduction in the amplitude of the P 2 component, likely reflecting an impaired process of action selection. In addition, a strong correlation was observed between the P 2 amplitude and grasping and rotation times. The P 2 component was localized to sources in the dorsal posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC), an area that is known to be involved in orienting visual body parts in space. Together these findings suggest that anticipatory planning deficits in cerebral palsy arise mainly due to an impaired process of action selection...|$|R
