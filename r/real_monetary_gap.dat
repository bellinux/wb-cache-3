40|$|This {{document}} {{presents the}} estimation of a recent version of the P-Star model by Gerlach and Svensson (2003) and its predictions for Colombia (January 1980 to April 2005). The model is designed to explain the inflation gap (observed rate minus the target) based on the <b>monetary</b> <b>gap</b> and the output gap. According to the results, the output gap lacks significant effects while the <b>monetary</b> <b>gap</b> has significant positive effects on inflation. ...|$|R

40|$|Using a {{laboratory}} experiment, we investigate {{the validity of}} stated risks elicited via the Exchangeability Method (EM) by defining a valuation method based on de Finetti’s notion of coherence. The reliability of risk estimates elicited through the EM has been theoretically questioned because the chained structure of the game, in which each question depends on the respondent’s answer to the previous one, is thought to potentially undermine the incentive compatibility of the elicitation mechanism even when <b>real</b> <b>monetary</b> incentives are provided.

40|$|When the Lucas {{paradigm}} is generalized to include real effects, {{the effects of}} <b>real</b> factors and <b>monetary</b> factors on the business cycle are always interrelated. Furthermore, in such models monetary factors can affect the long-run behavior or real output, contrary to the commonly held view that they can't. Real business cycle models and Lucas-type models are different paradigms {{not in the sense}} of <b>real</b> versus <b>monetary,</b> but in the interrelation- ships between <b>real</b> and <b>monetary</b> factors intrinsic to the Lucas paradigm as contrasted to the dichotomy between <b>real</b> and <b>monetary</b> factors implied by the real business cycle literature. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{stability}} of long-run log-linear demand functions for narrowly defined monetary aggregates (M 1, Monetary Base) in the U. S. during the post World War II period. The hypotheses that the individual time series which appear in such equations (real M 1, <b>real</b> <b>Monetary</b> Base, <b>real</b> Personal Income and short-term and long-term nominal interest rates) all have unit roots cannot be rejected. The primary conclusion {{of this study is}} that with proper attention to the time series properties of the available data, there exists strong evidence in support of a stable equilibrium demand function for real balances in the post-World War II U. S. economy. The hypothesis of a unitary equilibrium real income elasticity (a velocity function) cannot be rejected. Further, the estimates of equilibrium interest elasticities are approximately -. 5 to -. 6 for real M 1 and -. 4 to -. 5 for <b>real</b> <b>monetary</b> base. The estimated interest elasticities are significantly different statistically depending on whether long- term or short-term interest rates are used, but the observed differences in these estimates are not of economic significance. ...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, it can {{be noted}} that various conjectures have been {{advanced}} to explain behavior with St. Petersburg lotteries. However, {{with the exception of}} risk-aversion, none of the conjectures can explain what is observed in our experiments with decisions for <b>real</b> <b>monetary</b> and waiting time outcomes. Nevertheless, while risk-aversion can explain behavior in our St. Petersburg game, such risk-aversion in the waiting time experiments conflicts with risk-seeking attitudes elicited by the Holt–Laury procedure.|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} widely argued that {{government}} budget deficits reduce national saving.

Greater price-adjusted, high-employment deficits, increases in the <b>real</b> <b>monetary</b> base, and declines in real exchange rates have all been associated with more subsequent national saving. These relations, manifest in AR(1) regressions over the 1972 - 91, period were confirmed in vector autoregressions. Copyright 1994 by MIT Press. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper compares <b>real</b> and <b>monetary</b> {{business}} cycle models {{with and without}} endogenous technical change. If technology is endogenous, the properties of these models change significantly. In particular, both <b>real</b> and <b>monetary</b> models yield very similar output processes if growth is endogenous, and changes in aggregate demand can result in permanent changes in productivity, employment, and output. The effect of depreciation of technology is examined, and the pattern of real wage movements over the cycle when money wages are fixed, but technology is changing, is briefly considered.
