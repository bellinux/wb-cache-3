5|$|Despite {{irregularities}} in {{the approval of}} the Lecompton Constitution by Kansas voters, Breckinridge agreed with Buchanan that it was legitimate, but he kept his position secret, and some believed he agreed with his friend, Stephen Douglas, that Lecompton was invalid. Breckinridge's absence from the Senate during debate on admitting Kansas to the Union under Lecompton seemed to confirm this, but his leave—to take his wife from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where she was recovering from an illness, to Washington, D.C.—had been planned for months. The death of his grandmother, Polly Breckinridge, prompted him to leave earlier than planned. During his absence, both houses of Congress voted to re-submit the Lecompton Constitution to Kansas voters for approval. On <b>resubmission,</b> it was overwhelmingly rejected.|$|E

25|$|Coin {{certification}} {{has greatly}} {{reduced the number}} of counterfeits and grossly overgraded coins, and improved buyer confidence. Certification services can sometimes be controversial because grading is subjective; coins may be graded differently by different services or even upon <b>resubmission</b> to the same service. The numeric grade alone does not represent all of a coin's characteristics, such as toning, strike, brightness, color, luster, and attractiveness. Due to potentially large differences in value over slight differences in a coin's condition, some submitters will repeatedly resubmit a coin to a grading service in the hope of receiving a higher grade. Because fees are charged for certification, submitters must funnel money away from purchasing additional coins.|$|E

Many factors influence this decision, including prestige, acceptance probability, turnaround time, target audience, fit, and impact factor. Here, we present a framework for evaluating where to submit a manuscript based on the theory of Markov decision processes. We derive two models, one in which an author is trying to optimally maximize citations and another in which that goal is balanced by either minimizing the number of <b>resubmissions</b> or the total time in review. We parameterize the models with data on acceptance probability, submission-to-decision times, and impact factors for 61 ecology journals. We find that submission sequences beginning with Ecology Letters, Ecological Monographs, or PLOS ONE could be optimal depending on the importance given to time to acceptance or number of <b>resubmissions.</b> This analysis provides some guidance on where to submit a manuscript given the individual-specific values assigned to these disparate objectives...|$|R

40|$|When {{researchers}} {{complete a}} manuscript, {{they need to}} choose a journal to which they will submit the study. This decision requires to navigate trade-offs between multiple objectives. One objective is to share the new knowledge as widely as possible. Citation counts {{can serve as a}} proxy to quantify this objective. A second objective is to minimize the time commitment put into sharing the research, which may be estimated by the total time from initial submission to final decision. A third objective is to minimize the number of rejections and <b>resubmissions.</b> Thus, researchers often consider the trade-offs between the objectives of (i) maximizing citations, (ii) minimizing time-to-decision, and (iii) minimizing the number of <b>resubmissions.</b> To complicate matters further, this is a decision with multiple, potentially conflicting, decision-maker rationalities. Co-authors might have different preferences, for example about publishing fast versus maximizing citations. These diverging preferences can lead to conflicting trade-offs between objectives. Here, we apply a multi-objective decision analytical framework to identify the Pareto-front between these objectives and determine the set of journal submission pathways that balance these objectives for three stages of a researcher's career. We find multiple strategies that researchers might pursue, depending on how they value minimizing risk and effort relative to maximizing citations. The sequences that maximize expected citations within each strategy are generally similar, regardless of time horizon. We find that the "conditional impact factor"-impact factor times acceptance rate-is a suitable heuristic method for ranking journals, {{to strike a balance between}} minimizing effort objectives and maximizing citation count. Finally, we examine potential co-author tension resulting from differing rationalities by mapping out each researcher's preferred Pareto front and identifying compromise submission strategies. The explicit representation of trade-offs, especially when multiple decision-makers (co-authors) have different preferences, facilitates negotiations and can support the decision process...|$|R

Fundamental to both mechanisms is the efficient management of transient data: in the way it is scheduled and recovered.

40|$|Abstract. Replication {{has been}} widely used in J 2 EE servers for {{reliability}} and scalability. There are two properties which are important for a stateful J 2 EE application server. Firstly, {{the state of the}} server and the state of the backend databases should always be consistent. Secondly, each request from a client should be executed exactly once. In this paper, we propose a replication algorithm that provides both properties. We use passive replication where a primary server executes a request, and all state changed within the application server by this request is sent to the backup replicas {{at the end of the}} execution. An agreement protocol guarantees the consistency between the state of all replicas and the database. A client side communication stub automatically resubmits requests in case of failures, and unnecessary <b>resubmissions</b> are detected by the server replicas. We have implemented the algorithm and integrated it into the JBoss application server. A performance study using the ECPerf benchmark shows the feasibility of our approach...|$|R
