25|$|The idea of {{establishing}} a separate diplomatic service to handle the external activities of the Government of India originated from a note dated 30 September 1944, recorded by Lieutenant-General T. J. Hutton, the Secretary of the Planning and Development Department. When this note was referred to the Department of External Affairs for comments, Olaf Caroe, the Foreign Secretary, recorded his comments in an exhaustive note detailing the scope, composition and functions of the proposed service. Caroe pointed out that as India emerged as autonomous, it was imperative {{to build up a}} system of <b>representation</b> <b>abroad</b> that would be in complete harmony with the objectives of the future government.|$|E

25|$|A royal {{resolution}} of 20 June 1844, introduced new flags and heraldry to denote the equal {{status of the}} two kingdoms within the union. Both countries were granted civil and military ensigns on the same pattern, their respective national flags {{with the addition of}} a union mark in the canton, combining the flag colours of both countries. The naval ensign was based on the traditional triple-tailed Swedish model. In addition, the new union mark was to be used as the naval jack and as the flag for the common diplomatic <b>representations</b> <b>abroad.</b> The warrant also stipulated that the merchant fleet use their respective countries' square-cut civil ensigns, including the new union mark. Also, royal ensigns were introduced for both countries, their respective naval ensigns with the union mark, with the addition of the union arms at the center of the cross.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{describe}} perceptions of Brazilian diplomats in regard to legacies, diplomatic legacies and strategies that have been applied by the Brazilian government to leverage possible legacies of the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Drawing on soft power theory, I investigated whether Brazilian diplomats perceived the 2016 Rio Olympic Games as an opportunity for the country to gain diplomatic relevance in international affairs by improving its non-coercive power. I sent invitations to all ambassadors and consuls responsible for Brazilian <b>representations</b> <b>abroad</b> (N= 198). I received answers from 12 diplomats living abroad and one diplomat in charge of the department of General Coordination for Cooperation and Exchange on Sport, a department inside the Brazilian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Results showed that Brazilian diplomats perceived higher chances of positive legacies related to infrastructure, positive image of the country internationally and development of elite sport in the country. Few leverage strategies for diplomatic legacies were cited by the diplomats, who understand the event itself as the most important leveraging strategy. Implications for theory and practise are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Since Norway legally had {{the status}} of an {{independent}} state, the only institutions common to both countries were the king and the foreign service. All other ministries and government institutions were separate to each state, even the armies, navies and treasuries. The foreign service was directly subordinate to the king, an arrangement that was embodied already in the Norwegian constitution of 17 May 1814, before the revision of 4 November. An unforeseen effect was that foreign policy was decided in the Swedish cabinet and conducted by the Swedish ministry of foreign affairs. When matters of foreign policy were discussed in cabinet meetings, the only Norwegian present who could plead Norway's case was the prime minister. The Swedish Riksdag could indirectly influence foreign policy, but not the Norwegian Storting. Because the <b>representations</b> <b>abroad</b> were appointed by the Swedish government and mostly staffed with Swedes, the Union was often seen by foreigners {{to be more like}} a single state than two sovereign states. Over time, however, it became less common to refer to the union as [...] "Sweden" [...] and instead to jointly reference [...] "Sweden and Norway".|$|R

In Sweden, however, the new union mark in particular became quite unpopular and was contemptuously nicknamed the Sillsallaten (Swedish) or Sildesalaten (Norwegian) after a colorful dish of pickled herring, decorated with red beets and apples in a radial pattern. It is believed that the name was first used in a speech by Lord Brakel in the Swedish House of Lords in Stockholm.|$|R
50|$|Nation {{branding}} {{appears to}} be practiced by many countries, including the United States, Canada, France, United Kingdom (where it is officially referred to as public diplomacy), Taiwan, Malaysia, Japan, China, South Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and most Western European countries. An early example of this was the Cool Britannia approach of {{the early days of}} the New Labour government (following the Britain (TM) pamphlet by Demos's Mark Leonard), though this has since been replaced by a more credible Public Diplomacy Board. There is increasing interest in the concept from poorer states on the grounds that an enhanced image might create more favorable conditions for foreign direct investment, tourism, trade and even political relations with other states. Developing nations such as Tanzania and Colombia are creating smaller nation branding programs aimed at increased overall image and with the case of Colombia, changing international perception.Nation branding is seen as a part of Sweden's public diplomacy, especially with Brand Sweden. Sweden uses two main institutions, called the Utrikesdepartementet and the Swedish Institute, to study their nation branding. They wanted to present a good image through the press and also collect different reports on Sweden’s <b>representations</b> <b>abroad.</b> Different events and campaigns were also made to promote Brand Sweden, one example being the House of Sweden which was an embassy in the US. Another campaign was the Second House of Sweden which used the internet to introduce Sweden’s embassy virtually. Researchers in Sweden also studied the Nation Brand Index (NBI) results to collect data.|$|R
