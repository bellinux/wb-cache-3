5|$|DST's clock shifts {{have the}} obvious {{disadvantage}} of complexity. People must remember {{to change their}} clocks; this can be time-consuming, particularly for mechanical clocks that cannot be moved backward safely. People who work across time zone boundaries need {{to keep track of}} multiple DST rules, as not all locations observe DST or observe it the same way. The length of the calendar day becomes variable; it is no longer always 24 hours. Disruption to meetings, travel, broadcasts, billing systems, and <b>records</b> <b>management</b> is common, and can be expensive. During an autumn transition from 02:00 to 01:00, a clock reads times from 01:00:00 through 01:59:59 twice, possibly leading to confusion.|$|E
5|$|The Public Records Act 1958 {{required}} {{all government}} departments {{to set up}} archives and <b>records</b> <b>management</b> systems. The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) was nominally exempt from the act, being a government corporation rather than a department, but voluntarily asked to be included under the Act. This created a position at the UKAEA for an historian and archivist. Gowing applied for and secured the job in 1959. This involved organising systems and criteria for the selection for preservation of scientific, engineering and administrative records, and writing {{the history of the}} British atomic project since it had begun in 1939, the UKAEA having inherited the files of predecessor organisations including the Tube Alloys Directorate.|$|E
40|$|According to latest recommendations, the <b>record</b> <b>management</b> {{system of}} a nuclear {{facility}} should operate {{as a part of}} the integrated management information system, and is implemented at the very beginning of the facility’s life cycle. The <b>record</b> <b>management</b> becomes particularly important at the end of the operation of a facility and then the operational <b>record</b> <b>management</b> system gradually transforms to a decommissioning one. However there is a significant number of nuclear facilities in the world which have reached the decommissioning stage with out having neither the initial decommissioning plan nor the established <b>record</b> <b>management</b> system. The objective of this paper is to introduce constituted elements of the <b>record</b> <b>management</b> system for the decommissioning of the RA research reactor in the VINČA Institute of Nuclear Sciences, and to discuss future planned actions related to this matter...|$|R

The Halifax Explosion Remembrance Book, an official database compiled in 2002 by the Nova Scotia Archives and <b>Records</b> <b>Management,</b> identified 1,950 victims. As many as 1,600 people died immediately in the blast, tsunami, and collapse of buildings. The last body, a caretaker killed at the Exhibition Grounds, was not recovered until the summer of 1919. An additional 9,000 were injured. 1,630 homes were destroyed in the explosion and fires, and another 12,000 damaged; roughly 6,000 people were left homeless and 25,000 had insufficient shelter. The city's industrial sector was in large part gone, with many workers among the casualties and the dockyard heavily damaged.|$|E

5|$|The {{writing process}} for Pleasant Dreams began in January 1981. With Sire <b>Records</b> <b>management</b> being insistent on {{allowing}} a celebrity record producer {{to work on}} the album, they hired Graham Gouldman—songwriter and musician for the British band 10cc—to produce the album. Prior to working with Gouldman, the Ramones had been with audio engineer Ed Stasium to record several demos and, though Sire rejected, the band had intended that Steve Lillywhite produce the album. The studio recording process began on March 30, 1981, and initiated several conflicts between band members. This tension was partially due to Dee Dee Ramone's drug addiction. Additionally, Marky Ramone and Joey Ramone were both developing alcohol problems, resulting in the frustration of Johnny Ramone. These conflicts and differences became evident in the song writing, as each song was credited to individual rather than multiple members; Pleasant Dreams was the first album in which writing is acknowledged this way.|$|E
40|$|The <b>management</b> of <b>records</b> is an {{essential}} part of any organization. Today this implies the management of mostly digital records in electronic <b>record</b> <b>management</b> systems. There are many standards for <b>record</b> <b>management.</b> Three influential standards was compared and used to evaluate such an electronic <b>record</b> <b>management</b> system in this thesis. The purposes of the thesis was to find out how the core features support and interfere with each other, and which changes could be done to a system evaluated according to the standards, as well as what the major challenges were when using document standards to evaluate an electronic <b>record</b> <b>management</b> system. The standards were MoReq 2010, ISO 15489 and DoD 5012. 02. To conform to the standards, some changes could be done to the studied system. For instance, changing document keys and to include more metadata about disposal of records. The conclusions were that standards are a good complementary source when developing an existing <b>record</b> <b>management</b> system, even though their size and complexity level are issues to deal with...|$|R

However, {{in the early years of}} the Colony's history, little attention was paid to the management and preservation of non-current public records. This was mainly because the government of the day was fully focussed on the administration of the convict system, law and order, immigration and land settlement. Documents which were not required for the day-to-day running of the government were usually neglected or were destroyed.|$|E

25|$|The National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime {{statistics}} system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system {{is used by}} law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their <b>records</b> <b>management</b> systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the {{crime statistics}} data collected by the FBI.|$|E

500|$|When {{the time}} came to return to a {{recording}} studio, the band looked for a new record producer. Lillywhite, who had done the work for both of their previous albums, had other commitments, and many in the band felt it was time to chart a new course anyway. Columbia <b>Records</b> <b>management</b> first attempted to match the band with David Bowie, who was a high-profile Furs supporter and who expressed enthusiasm for working with them. Bowie, however, also had commitments which would have postponed work for what the band felt would be an unacceptably long time. More importantly, there was a belief among some band members that this partnership would not yield much of a change. According to Richard Butler, [...] "the media were already making lots of comparisons between our music and his", and the band did not want to appear too indebted. An eleventh-hour offer by Lillywhite to fit the band into his schedule was politely declined.|$|E
500|$|After the {{recording}} of [...] "Crazy for You", the soundtrack single for the 1985 coming of age drama Vision Quest, Madonna approached John [...] "Jellybean" [...] Benitez to produce another of her self-written songs called [...] "Gambler". Subsequently, the song {{was added to the}} soundtrack of the film, as music producer Phil Ramone felt that it would be appropriate for using in the beginning shots of the film. Madonna explained that the track [...] "is really the girl's point of view, because she's, like, an unstoppable person... She doesn't really need this guy". As the song was recorded on the Geffen label, a commercial issue of the single, in the United States was suppressed, at the request of Madonna's Sire <b>Records</b> <b>management.</b> They feared that commercial availability of another Madonna single would have been detrimental to the other singles from the Like a Virgin album, and the already available, Geffen-distributed, [...] "Crazy for You". Hence [...] "Gambler" [...] was never released, or sent for airplay in the United States. The UK 12" [...] single, contained the Extended Dance Mix, Instrumental Remix, and the song [...] "Nature of the Beach" [...] by Black 'n Blue. [...] The 7" [...] single had the original version, and [...] "Nature of the Beach". The video for [...] "Gambler" [...] is similar to [...] "Crazy for You", with Madonna singing the song along with clips culled from Vision Quest. Madonna filmed her performance on November 22, 1983, at the Big Foot Tavern in Spokane, Washington. [...] "Gambler" [...] remained Madonna's last single written entirely by herself for over two decades, until [...] "Hey You" [...] (2007). According to Stylus Magazine, Madonna said that she got too lazy to write songs without help.|$|E
