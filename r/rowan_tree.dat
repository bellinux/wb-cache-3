2500|$|Unless you are {{allergic}} to the pollen of certain trees and herbs (such as birch, horse chestnut, alder, lilac, cherry tree, ash tree, <b>rowan</b> <b>tree,</b> lime tree, dandelion), {{the best time}} for travelling to central European Russia is late spring when the temperatures are pleasant and many trees are in bloom, and early and mid autumn when trees change their colour and it is not cold yet. Summer months are also good except for June in cities in central and south Russia when poplar fluff can be a nuisance, but recently the authorities of many Russian cities have taken action against the fluff by cutting and removing poplar trees and the situation has improved dramatically. Late autumn, winter months, and early spring will be enjoyable if you wear appropriate clothes and shoes. If you are interested in winter activities, in central European Russia it usually begins to snow in late autumn and snowpack usually doesn't melt away completely before early April, although spells of warm weather do occur and snow can temporarily melt away in mid-winter. Ski resorts in mountainous areas have snow throughout the winter season. Central European Russia sometimes experiences cold spells in early May when the temperature can go from +15°C/59°F to the freezing point for a few days.|$|E

60|$|But the Campbells, {{though they}} had already {{attained}} very great power in Argyleshire, had not yet extended themselves so far eastward as Loch Tay, the banks of which were, either by right or by mere occupancy, possessed for, the present by the Clan Quhele, whose choicest herds were fattened on the Balloch margin of the lake. In this valley, therefore, between {{the river and the}} lake, amid extensive forests of oak wood, hazel, <b>rowan</b> <b>tree,</b> and larches, arose the humble cottage of Niel Booshalloch, a village Eumaeus, whose hospitable chimneys were seen to smoke plentifully, to the great encouragement of Simon Glover, who might otherwise have been obliged {{to spend the night in}} the open air, to his no small discomfort.|$|E
40|$|A {{system was}} {{developed}} to provide the parasitic wasp Ephedrus persicae Froggatt (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiinae), which attacks the rosy apple aphid Dysaphis plantaginea (Passerini) (Homoptera: Aphididae), with the alternative host Dysaphis sorbi Kaltenbach (Homoptera: Aphididae) in apple orchards. <b>Rowan</b> <b>trees</b> (Sorbus aucuparia L.) arranged {{along the side of}} an unsprayed orchard were artificially infested in late February 2002 with eggs of D. sorbi. Colonies of D. sorbi successfully developed from the introduced eggs and persisted on several trees until the end of June. The only primary parasitoid species emerging from a sample of mummified aphids collected in spring from the infested <b>rowan</b> <b>trees</b> was the braconid wasp species E. persicae. In a host-switching experiment, nymphs of D. plantaginea proved suitable for female parasitoids originating from mummified D. sorbi. A series of mummies collected from the <b>rowan</b> <b>trees</b> in early summer contained diapausing parasitoids and hyperparasitoids that only hatched in April of the following spring. These observations suggest the possibility of establishing a local population of E. persicae in apple orchards, so that D. plantaginea can be readily attacked by diapause-emerging parasitoids in early spring. status: publishe...|$|R

60|$|The {{rock was}} called Ahtola, {{and was not}} larger than the market-place of a town. Between the crevices there grew a little <b>rowan</b> <b>tree</b> and four alder bushes. Heaven only knows how they ever came there; perhaps they were brought by the winter storms. Besides that, there flourished some tufts of velvety grass, some {{scattered}} reeds, two plants of the yellow herb called tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; but the treasures of the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie had put in a cleft. Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and the sun shone on them on the south. This does not seem much, but it sufficed Maie for a herb plot.|$|E

You know what these crofter fellows are--ungrateful, vindictive rascals. He had been in receipt of outdoor relief for years. Well, he prophesied stuff like this: 'When the owl and the eagle meet on the same blasted <b>rowan</b> <b>tree,</b> then a lassie in a white hood from the east shall make the burn of Cross-cleugh run full red,' and drivel of that insane kind. Well, you can't think what trouble that particular prophecy gave me.

6000|$|Since {{we shall}} {{presently}} find Mr. Max Muller claiming the celebrated Mannhardt as a sometime deserter of philological comparative mythology, who 'returned {{to his old}} colours,' I observe with pleasure that Mannhardt is on my side and against the Oxford Professor. Mannhardt shows that the laurel (daphne) {{was regarded as a}} plant which, like our <b>rowan</b> <b>tree,</b> averts evil influences. 'Moreover, the laurel, like the Maibaum, was looked on as a being with a spirit. This is the safest result which myth analysis can extract from the story of Daphne, a nymph pursued by Apollo and changed into a laurel. It {{is a result of the}} use of the laurel in his ritual.' {20b} In 1877, a year after Mannhardt is said by Mr. Max Muller to have returned to his old colours, he repeats this explanation. {21a} In the same work (p. 20) he says that 'there is no reason for accepting Max Muller's explanation about the Sun-god and the Dawn, wo jeder thatliche Anhalt dafur fehlt.' For this opinion we might also cite the Sanskrit scholars Whitney and Bergaigne. {21b} ...|$|E

50|$|Several {{varieties}} of <b>rowan</b> <b>trees</b> {{cling to the}} cliffs. The common sorbus aucuparia lives side-by-side with the sorbus rupicola or rock whitebeam.

50|$|Sionainn is one {{of seven}} rivers of {{knowledge}} said to flow from Connla's Well, the well of wisdom in the Celtic Otherworld (the realm of the dead).

The falls can be easily visited by a riverside path from Keld; however, care should be taken, as the stones around the falls are often wet and slippery.
