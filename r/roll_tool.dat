40|$|With the {{steadily}} {{increase in}} demand for roll formed products due to their application for fields such as automotive, construction, architecture, etc., roll forming companies are challenge with rising customer demands. Companies are struggling to bring a product through from design to manufacture at improved rates, whilst achieving tighter tolerances. The roll forming process may also induce undesirable forming defects such as twist, distortion and straightness problems. Traditionally these issues would be resolved through an empirical approach which heavily relies on the designer's expertise and intuition. This approach can increase undesired development costs due to materials wasted and time delayed. Over the years, numerical simulations have been deployed to try and geometrically validate these defects and ultimately reduce the development phase of a product. The designer has the capability to virtually investigate changes in specific parameters without the risk of expensive tooling costs. The industry partner of this project, Hadley Group, Birmingham, implement Belleville washers into the <b>roll</b> <b>tool</b> configuration. The purpose of these washers is to apply pressure to the strip during roll forming in order to drive material through each forming station. They are also used to adjust {{the gap between the}} top and bottom forming rolls, since the incoming material gauge can vary by the nominal tolerance values from coil to coil. For the purpose of this paper, an investigation is carried out focusing on an individual parameter within the finite element analysis (FEA) of the cold roll forming process, i. e. the 'unknown' spring acting on the top roll during the forming process due to the implementation of Belleville washers in the pillar set up. The work explained in this paper shows the eects of the pressure applied to the forming process on the geometric attributes of the section being formed. The outcome will determine the viability of this parameter, which may ultimately require the numerical design methodology of roll formed products to be amended accordingly...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is about a}} costly problem in the automotive industry due to tool fracture during the splines cold rolling of steel shafts. The objective is to study {{the cause of this}} failure and propose solutions that can be implemented in the workshop. The writing starts with a brief introduction of the companies involved in shafts production and problem solving. It introduces the cold rolling process and its advantages on splines manufacturing, and it goes through relevant material and process characteristics that help to determine the cause of tool fracture. In order to understand the process failure and production flow, it has been necessary to build up an Ishikawa diagram with possible tool fracture causes. After collecting and analysing the data about the machine tool, cold rolling process and work-piece and rolling tool materials, tests and experiments have been done. It has been considered that there is a rolling tool fatigue that causes tool fracture. Beside tool fracture, two more problems with production flow instability and the right side rolling tool have been detected. Testing the material hardness of the work-piece has shown continuous hardness fluctuations from the supplier. <b>Rolling</b> <b>tool</b> misalignment has been measured by using a vernier caliper measurement device. <b>Rolling</b> <b>tools</b> material hardness analysis shows that tool is very hard and it is possible to use a tougher material which responds better to cyclic loads. Leax has tried to solve the problem by testing another lubrication and tool coatings. A modal analysis test has been performed in order to find the natural frequency of the work-piece which possibly may lead to vibration and over loading one of the rolling tools. The conclusion that has been reached is that main cause of fracture is rolling tool fatigue due to cyclic loads and it is important to use other rolling tool material. The other two detected problems, production flow instability and rigth side rolling tool fracture, should be considered {{as a part of the}} problem in order to significantly increase tools life and stabilize production flow rate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{study on}} grain {{evolution}} character of discal parts roll forming {{was carried out}} by means of experiment and numerical simulation. The discal part material is aluminum alloy 6061 and titanium alloy TC 4. The roll forming temperature is 480 - 500 ℃ and 930 - 1020 ℃ for aluminum alloy 6061 and titanium alloy TC 4, respectively. A digital double-sided roll forming machine was used for roll forming experiment of discal parts. The high frequency induction heating was used for disk heating, where the deformation zone is in the state of constant temperature. A numerical simulation of roll forming of the 6061 aluminum alloy disk was carried out. The simulated results include macroscopic deformation and various grain size evolution variables. The dynamic recrystallization, the dynamic and static grain growth were considered in the numerical simulation. The experimental and simulated results showed that there may appear not only the grain refinement due to dynamic recrystallization but also dynamic and static grain growth. It is different that from discal parts integrally forging there are the largest deformation, the highest strain rate and the best recrystallization and grain refinement in the zones contacted with the <b>roll</b> <b>tools.</b> In the zones far from the rollers, the strain rate is very low and average grain size increases until once again contact to the rollers and start new grain refinement...|$|R

40|$|In {{the paper}} machine, {{it is not}} a desired feature for the {{boundary}} layer flows in the fabric and the roll surfaces to travel into the closing nips, creating overpressure. In this thesis, the aerodynamic behavior of the grooved roll and smooth rolls is compared {{in order to understand the}} nip flow phenomena, which is the main reason why vacuum and grooved roll constructions are designed. A common method to remove the boundary layer flow from the closing nip is to use the vacuum roll construction. The downside of the use of vacuum rolls is high operational costs due to pressure losses in the vacuum roll shell. The deep grooved roll has the same goal, to create a pressure difference over the paper web and keep the paper attached to the roll or fabric surface in the drying pocket of the paper machine. A literature review revealed that the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is not very well known. In this thesis, the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll in interaction with a permeable or impermeable wall is studied by varying the groove properties. Computational fluid dynamics simulations are utilized as the research tool. The simulations have been performed with commercial fluid dynamics software, ANSYS Fluent. Simulation results made with 3 - and 2 -dimensional fluid dynamics models are compared to laboratory scale measurements. The measurements have been made with a grooved roll simulator designed for the research. The variables in the comparison are the paper or fabric wrap angle, surface velocities, groove geometry and wall permeability. Present-day computational and modeling resources limit grooved roll fluid dynamics simulations in the paper machine scale. Based on the analysis of the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll, a grooved <b>roll</b> simulation <b>tool</b> is proposed. The smooth roll simulations show that the closing nip pressure does not depend on the length of boundary layer development. The surface velocity increase affects the pressure distribution in the closing and opening nips. The 3 D grooved roll model reveals the aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll. With the optimal groove size it is possible to avoid closing nip overpressure and keep the web attached to the fabric surface in the area of the wrap angle. The groove flow friction and minor losses play a different role when the wrap angle is changed. The proposed 2 D grooved <b>roll</b> simulation <b>tool</b> is able to replicate the grooved aerodynamic behavior with reasonable accuracy. A small wrap angle predicts the pressure distribution correctly with the chosen approach for calculating the groove friction losses. With a large wrap angle, the groove friction loss shows too large pressure gradients, and the way of calculating the air flow friction losses in the groove has to be reconsidered. The aerodynamic functionality of the grooved roll is based on minor and viscous losses in the closing and opening nips as well as in the grooves. The proposed 2 D grooved roll model is a simplification in order to reduce computational and modeling efforts. The simulation tool makes it possible to simulate complex paper machine constructions in the paper machine scale. In order to use the grooved roll as a replacement for the vacuum roll, the grooved roll properties have to be considered on the basis of the web handling application...|$|R

5000|$|Danah Boyd, {{a senior}} {{researcher}} at Microsoft Research, noted of social networking websites that Myspace {{and others were}} a very peculiar business—one in which companies might serially rise, fall, and disappear, as [...] "Influential peers pull others in on the climb up—and signal to flee when it's time to get out". The volatility of social networks was exemplified in 2006 when Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal launched an investigation into children's exposure to pornography on Myspace; the resulting media frenzy and Myspace's inability to build an effective spam filter gave the site {{a reputation as a}} [...] "vortex of perversion". Around that time, specialized social media companies such as Twitter formed and began targeting Myspace users, while Facebook <b>rolled</b> out communication <b>tools</b> which were seen as safe in comparison to Myspace. Boyd compared the shift of white, middle-class kids from the [...] "seedy" [...] Myspace to the [...] "supposedly safer haven" [...] of Facebook, to the [...] "white flight" [...] from American cities; the perception of Myspace eventually drove advertisers away as well. In addition, Myspace had particular problems with vandalism, phishing, malware and spam which it failed to curtail, making the site seem inhospitable.|$|R
