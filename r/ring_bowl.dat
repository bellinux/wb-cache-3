40|$|Density {{functional}} techniques including gradient corrections {{are used}} to investigate the relative energies of the <b>ring,</b> <b>bowl</b> (cor-annulene-like), and cage (fullerene-like) isomers of Cl,,. In agreement with previous studies, the local density approximation yields the cage {{to be the most}} stable isomer with the bowl and ring forms being significantly higher in energy. However, the inclusion of gradient corrections completely reverses the energy ordering of the isomers.
