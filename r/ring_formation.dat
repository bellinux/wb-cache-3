This results in <b>ring</b> <b>formation</b> around an earbone called the otolith, (annuli) analogous to the growth rings visible in a tree trunk. Freshwater growth shows as densely crowded rings, sea growth as widely spaced rings; spawning is marked by significant erosion as body mass is converted into eggs and milt.|$|E
25|$|Minichromosome {{maintenance}} proteins {{have been}} found to be required for DNA helicase activity and inactivation of any of the six Mcm proteins prevents further progression of the replication fork. This is consistent with the requirement of ORC, Cdc6, and Cdt1 function to assemble the Mcm proteins at the origin of replication. The complex containing all six Mcm proteins creates a hexameric, doughnut like structure with a central cavity. The helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex raises the question of how the ring-like complex is loaded onto the single-stranded DNA. One possibility is that the helicase activity of the Mcm protein complex can oscillate between an open and a closed <b>ring</b> <b>formation</b> to allow single-stranded DNA loading.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{enthalpy}} {{should be}} {{approximately the same}} for the two reactions, {{the difference between the two}} stability constants is due to the effects of entropy. In equation (...) there are two particles on the left and one on the right, whereas in equation (...) there are three particles on the left and one on the right. This difference means that less entropy of disorder is lost when the chelate complex is formed than when the complex with monodentate ligands is formed. This is one of the factors contributing to the entropy difference. Other factors include solvation changes and <b>ring</b> <b>formation.</b> Some experimental data to illustrate the effect are shown in the following table.|$|E
2500|$|Wei Qing's army, {{setting off}} from Dingxiang, {{encountered}} Yizhixie Chanyu's army. Wei Qing ordered his troops to arrange heavy-armored chariots in a <b>ring</b> <b>formation,</b> creating mobile fortresses that provided archers, crossbowmen, and infantry {{protection from the}} Xiongnu's cavalry charges, and allowing the Han troops to utilize their ranged weapons' advantages. A 5000-strong cavalry was deployed to reinforce the array against any Xiongnu attack. The Xiongnu charged the Han forces with a 10,000-strong vanguard cavalry. The battle solidified into a stalemate until dusk, when a sandstorm obscured the battlefield. Subsequently, Wei Qing sent in his main forces and overwhelmed the Xiongnu. The Han cavalry used the low visibility as cover and encircled the Xiongnu army from both flanks, but Yizhixie Chanyu and a contingent of troops broke through and escaped.|$|E
2500|$|Henry Warren was {{contracted}} to haul supplies to forts {{in the west}} of Texas, including Fort Richardson, Fort Griffin, and Fort Concho. On May 18, 1871, travelling down the Jacksboro-Belknap road heading towards Salt Creek Crossing, the supplies wagon train encountered Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman, but, {{less than an hour}} later, the teamsters spotted a rather large group of riders ahead. Hidden in a thicket of scrub in the Salt Creek Prairie, the Kiowa had observed, without attacking, the slow approach of General Sherman's inspection retinue. [...] The previous night, Mamanti ("He Walking-above"), the powerful shaman rival of Tene-angopte's friend Napawat ("No Mocassins"), had prophesied that this small party would be followed by a larger one with more plunder for the taking. [...] Three hours later the 10 mule-drawn wagons filled with army corn and fodder came to the spot: in front of the charging warriors, the corn train [...] quickly shifted into a <b>ring</b> <b>formation,</b> and all the mules were put {{into the center of the}} ring, but the defenders were overwhelmed and the warriors destroyed the corn supplies, killing and mutilating seven of the wagoneer's bodies. [...] The Kiowa warriors lost three of their own, but left with 40 mules heavily laden with supplies. Five white men managed to escape, one of which was Thomas Brazeale who reached Fort Richardson on foot, some 20 miles away. As soon as Col. Ranald S. Mackenzie learned of the incident, he informed Sherman. Sherman and Mackenzie searched for the warriors responsible for the raid. The ambush had been planned by a large band of Kiowa warriors under the leadership of Satanta, Ado-ete ("Big Tree"), Satank, and Mamanti ("He Walking-above"), and several other chiefs took part in it, as did Zepko-ete ("Big Bow"), Tsen-tainte ("White Horse"), Guatotente ("Eagle Heart"), Gui-guako ("Yellow Wolf"), Set-maunte ("Fast Bear"), and, perhaps, Guipago himself.|$|E

Flow and combustion dynamics for non-reacting and reacting situations are analysed. The influence of Reynolds number on the vorticity distribution and vortex <b>rings</b> <b>formation</b> for non-reacting cases is examined. A modified flame index is introduced to identify the flame regime during the partially premixed combustion. The combustion instability phenomenon is detected by applying Fourier spectra analysis. Several scalar variables are monitored to investigate the combustion dynamics at different operating conditions. The effects of swirl number, equivalence ratio and nitrogen dilution on combustion dynamics are studied in detail...|$|R

5000|$|A {{particular}} {{strength of}} speleothems {{in this regard}} is their unique ability to be accurately dated over much of the late Quaternary period using the uranium-thorium dating technique. Stable isotopes of oxygen (δ18O) and carbon (δ13C) are recorded well in speleothems, giving high-resolution data that can show annual variation in temperature (oxygen isotopes primarily reflect rainfall temperature) and precipitation (carbon isotopes primarily reflect C3/C4 plant composition and plant productivity, but the interpretation is often complicated). [...] By sampling along a dated transect of a speleothem, these isotope values and speleothem growth rates provide a paleoclimate records similar to those from ice cores. Variations in precipitation alter the width of new <b>ring</b> <b>formation,</b> where close <b>ring</b> <b>formation</b> shows little rainfall, and wider spacing for heavier rainfall.|$|E

40|$|AbstractPeroxynitrite is {{a highly}} {{reactive}} species, generated from Superoxide and nitric oxide. Some effects of peroxynitrite are ascribed to the molecule itself, but decomposition products of the protonated form, peroxynitrous acid, may account for much of its reactivity in biological systems. Suggested products include highly-reactive hydroxyl radicals, but thermodynamic calculations {{have been used to}} claim that free hydroxyl radicals cannot be formed from peroxynitrite. We utilized aromatic hydroxylation of phenylalanine as a specific detector of hydroxyl radicals, and found that incubation of phenylalanine with peroxynitrite leads to a small amount of p-, m- and o-tyrosine, specific products of attack by this radical. Products of nitration of phenylalanine and tyrosine were also detected, as was dityrosine. Peroxynitrite decomposition generates several reactive species, including some that can nitrate aromatic <b>rings.</b> <b>Formation</b> of nitro-aromatic compounds may be a useful marker of peroxynitrite generation in biological systems...|$|R
40|$|Rings of {{typically}} 0. 5 mu m diameter {{have been}} observed with the atomic force microscope and the scanning electron microscope in carbon nanotube deposits produced catalytically by thermal decomposition of hydrocarbon gas. The carbon nanotubes are predominantly multiwalled with an average thickness of 20 nm, which is the typical thickness of the rings as well. The observations are discussed {{in light of the}} previous discoveries of helical nanotubes in the same material and the observation of rings of similar thickness and diameter (interpreted as toroids) in single wall carbon nanotube material grown by laser vaporization. In our observations, the <b>ring</b> <b>formations</b> can be interpreted as single turn coils with a short overlap between {{the beginning and end of}} the coiled nanotube, but the toroidal interpretation cannot be ruled out.
