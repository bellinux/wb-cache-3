40|$|The {{semantic}} <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> {{natural language}} quantifiers (e. g. "all," "some," "most") neither coincide with nor resemble the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the analogues of those expressions {{that occur in}} the artificial languages used by semanticists. Some semanticists, e. g. Peter Strawson, have put forth data-consistent hypotheses as to the identities of the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> some natural-language quantifiers. But, despite their obvious merits, those hypotheses have been universally rejected. In this paper, it is shown that those hypotheses are indeed correct. Moreover, data-consistent hypotheses are put forth as to the identities of the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> the words "most" and "many," the semantic <b>rules</b> <b>governing</b> which semanticists have thus far been unable to identify. The points made in this paper are anticipated in a paper, published in the same issue of the Journal of Pragmatics, by Andrzej Boguslawski...|$|R
