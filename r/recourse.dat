30|$|Introduction <b>Recourses</b> to the {{intensive}} care units (ICU) physicians by the emergency department (ED) physicians are frequent, estimated around once a day. Nevertheless, these <b>recourses</b> are inherently unpredictable. A good relationship seems very important for an adequate care of the patients and a rational use of hospital resources. The collaboration between these two entities remains poorly described. Therefore, we aimed to characterize those <b>recourses.</b>|$|R

However, a participant in a 7,000-member online support group brought a lawsuit against a website for defamatory language in 2005. The lawsuit followed heated discussion on the website about his dire predicaments and related crises, which seemed to contradict medical knowledge and his own accounts. The lawsuit was withdrawn after the presiding judge intended to allow cross-examination of the plaintiff's medical history.|$|E
5|$|Chinese {{human rights}} lawyers have {{charged that the}} 610 Office {{regularly}} interferes with legal cases involving Falun Gong practitioners, subverting the ability of judges to adjudicate independently. Attorney Jiang Tianyong has noted that cases where the defendants are Falun Gong practitioners are decided by the local 610 Offices, rather than through <b>recourse</b> to legal standards. In November 2008, two lawyers seeking to represent Falun Gong practitioners in Heilongjiang noted that the presiding judge in the case was seen meeting with 610 Office agents. Other lawyers, including Gao Zhisheng, Guo Guoting and Wang Yajun have alleged that the 610 Office interfered with their ability to meet with Falun Gong clients or defend them in court.|$|E

40|$|Creation of {{interactive}} multimedia study <b>recourses</b> used in e-learning courses is a demanding and time-consuming activity.

The teachers, who are usually the only creators of the materials, are forced to improvise. This contribution presents two approaches for study <b>recourses</b> creation. The first one is an original solution of the e-learning <b>recourses</b> design, created at University of Zilina in 2006. The methodology uses a scenario creation comes out from analogy of movie scenarios because the interactive multimedia study <b>recourses</b> are quasi movies. The second method is more systematic, it is based on looking at e-study resource design as at partial information system design. One way of systematic analyze of informatics systems design is to use the Service Oriented Architecture for it. Both methods endeavour to achieve interoperability of e-study resources, therefore there are used standards for resources saving and delivering...|$|R

5|$|In {{the mid-1980s}} Mikhail Gorbachev instituted glasnost, {{allowing}} greater {{freedom of speech}} and organization than ever before in the USSR. This openness generated a burst in women’s political action, academic research, and artistic and business ventures. Additionally, women were aware that the new government would offer little assistance with their economic and social struggles. Citizens of the Soviet Union could file complaints and receive redress through the Communist Party, but the post-Soviet government had not developed systems of state <b>recourse.</b> Women began to form their own networks of resource sharing and emotional support, which sometimes developed into grassroots organizations.|$|E

In some cases, punk's {{do it yourself}} ethic reflected an aversion to commercial success, {{as well as a}} desire to maintain creative and financial autonomy. As Joe Harvard, a participant in the Boston scene, describes, it was often a simple necessity—the absence of a local recording industry and well-distributed music magazines left little <b>recourse</b> but DIY.|$|E

Massenet's practical experience in orchestra pits as a young man and his careful training at the Conservatoire equipped him to make such effects without much <b>recourse</b> to unusual instruments. He understood the capabilities of his singers, and composed with close, detailed regard for their voices.|$|E
5|$|On July 15, 1961, to {{meet the}} burgeoning {{educational}} demands of South Florida, the state legislature passed an act authorizing {{the establishment of a}} new university in the City of Boca Raton. Florida Atlantic University was built on Boca Raton Army Airfield, a 1940s-era army airbase. During World War II, the airfield served as the Army Air Corps' sole radar training facility. The base was built on the existing Boca Raton Airport and on 5,860acres (23.7km²) of adjacent land. A majority of the land was acquired from Japanese-American farmers from the failing Yamato Colony. The land was seized through eminent domain, leaving many Japanese-Americans little <b>recourse</b> {{in the early days of}} World War II.|$|E

5|$|The Poor Law system {{began to}} decline with the {{availability}} of other forms of assistance. The growth of friendly societies provided help for its members without <b>recourse</b> to the Poor Law system. Some trade unions also provided help for their members. The Medical Relief Disqualification Removal Act 1885 meant that people who had accessed medical care funded by the poor rate were no longer disqualified from voting in elections. In 1886 the Chamberlain Circular encouraged the Local Government Board to set up work projects when unemployment rates were high rather than use workhouses. In 1905 the Conservatives passed the Unemployed Workman Act which provided for temporary employment for workers in times of unemployment.|$|E
5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and inevitability of such {{criminal}} types in society.

Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open <b>recourse.</b> They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|Casey's initial {{need was}} for {{engineer}} units {{to accomplish the}} daunting construction program, but soon stocks of engineer supplies and equipment began to run low. This was exacerbated by incoming units arriving without their equipment, or with it stowed on numerous ships, which often arrived at various ports in a theater where ports were hundred or thousands of miles apart. Critical shortages developed of tractors, graders, concrete mixers and welding equipment. In {{the absence of a}} proper stock control system, an overall coordinating agency, and adequate numbers of engineer depot units, the allocation and distribution of the meager supplies on hand were difficult tasks. The worst problem was spare parts. Equipment was operated around the clock under harsh conditions and soon wore out or broke. A large proportion of equipment became unserviceable for lack of spare parts. Requisitions sent to the United States took months to arrive, so <b>recourse</b> was made to the limited sources of supply in Australia.|$|E
