40|$|In {{response}} to widespread global degradation of mangrove forests, many initiatives have been undertaken to reforest degraded sites. However, {{many of these}} <b>replantings</b> are monospecific, raising questions regarding habitat change and reduced ecological functions in mangrove plantations compared to natural mixed mangrove forests. The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether colonising mangrove juveniles can be recruited into the adult tree layer and thus enhance the structural complexity of previously reforested monospecific stands. Vegetation structure of originally monospecific replanted mangrove stands (Sonneratia alba and Rhizophora mucronata) that were 8 yr old was assessed. Instantaneous juvenile (seedling/sapling) diversity and abundance were determined. Adjacent natural stands were used as reference sites. The R. mucronata stand had the same species richness as its natural reference and thus had a higher Complexity Index due to recruitment of non-planted species into the adult tree population than in a previous assessment when it was monospecific. Juvenile species richness and diversity were similar between the R. mucronata stands (reforested and natural); however, the total juvenile density was significantly higher (p – 1) than in the reforested stand (2048 ± 667 juveniles ha – 1). In contrast, the adult vegetation layer of the S. alba reforested stand remained monospecific, suggesting 100 % mortality of previously observed non-planted mangrove juveniles. Many replanted mangroves around the globe are monocultures and are thus likely to have low thresholds to as they do not benefit from the ‘portfolio effect’ provided in mixed species stands. Successful recruitment of non-planted species into replanted monospecific mangroves stands may therefore enhance ecosystem productivity and stability. However, more research needs to be conducted on traits of different mangrove species and their contribution to ecosystem productivity and sensitivities to environmental perturbations...|$|E
40|$|The {{course of}} ‘flavescence dorée’ (FD) and ‘bois noir’ (BN) {{diseases}} {{can result in}} either recovery or death of affected grapevines. When farmers observe symptomatic grapevines, they must choose whether to replace or maintain the plants. To establish {{whether there is an}} advantage in replacing symptomatic grapevines, data were collected on the costs of replacing them (removing the diseased plants and planting new grapevines, with resultant yield loss during the rearing period) and growing them on (yield losses in symptomatic grapevines over the following years). To calculate the cost of maintaining FD-infected plants, the possibility was also considered that symptomatic grapevines may be sources of phytoplasmas for the vector Scaphoideus titanus Ball. The symptomatic course of BN was observed in ‘Chardonnay’, and of FD in ‘Chardonnay’, ‘Merlot’ and ‘Perera’ grape cultivars. The costs of replacement decreased with the increase in the productive lifetime of the vineyards. The cost of maintenance was greatly influenced by the course of the diseases, {{and in the case of}} FD, also by the risk of new infections due to the fact that S. titanus acquires phytoplasmas from infected grapevines. The replacement of plants affected by BN is not profitable when recovery is the most frequent course of the disease, particularly when it is considered that <b>replantings</b> can, in turn, become infected. The replacement of plants affected by FD is not profitable for cultivars with a recovery near to 100 % (‘Merlot’), whereas it is necessary for cultivars where the course of the disease is frequently lethal (‘Perera’). For cultivars with intermediate sensitivity, the decision varies in relation to agronomic/economic factors and to the risk of new infections (‘Chardonnay’). For FD, both replacement and maintenance strategies need to be associated with S. titanus control inside and outside the vineyards. In the case of maintenance the infected plants can be sources of phytoplasmas, and in the case of replacement, the vector can also inoculate the new grapevines...|$|E
40|$|Publication of {{this article}} was funded by the Stellenbosch University Open Access Fund. The {{original}} publication is available at [URL] The influence of introduction history and post-introduction dynamics on genetic diversity and structure has been a major research focus in invasion biology. However, genetic diversity and structure in the invasive range can also be affected by human-mediated processes in the native range prior to species introductions, an aspect often neglected in invasion biology. Here we aim to trace the native provenance of the invasive tree Acacia pycnantha by comparing the genetic diversity and structure between populations in the native Australian range and the invasive range in South Africa. This approach also allowed us to explore how human actions altered genetic structure before and after the introduction of A. pycnantha into South Africa. We hypothesized that extensive movement and replanting in A. pycnantha’s Australian range prior to its introduction to South Africa might result in highly admixed genotypes in the introduced range, comparable genetic diversity in both ranges, and therefore preclude an accurate determination of native provenance(s) of invasive populations. Results: In the native range Bayesian assignment tests identified three genetic clusters with substantial admixture and could not clearly differentiate previously identified genetic entities, corroborating admixture as a result of <b>replantings</b> within Australia. Assignment tests that included invasive populations from South Africa indicated similar levels of admixture compared to Australian populations and a lack of genetic structure. Invasive populations of A. pycnantha in South Africa are as genetically diverse as native populations, and could not be assigned to particular native range regions. Conclusions: Our results indicate that the genetic structure of A. pycnantha in Australia has been greatly altered through various planting initiatives. Specifically, there is little geographic structure and high levels of admixture. While numerous introduction history scenarios may explain the levels of admixture observed in South Africa, planting records of A. pycnantha in Australia suggest that populations were probably already admixed before propagules were introduced to South Africa. These findings have important implications for the management of invasive A. pycnantha populations in South Africa, especially for classical biological control, and more broadly, for studies that aim to understand the evolutionary dynamics of the invasion process.

40|$|Streams {{and rivers}} are {{intrinsically}} {{linked to the}} terrestrial environment by the exchange of water, nutrients, organic matter and biota. Terrestrial-aquatic connectivity has been disrupted by the degradation and removal of riparian vegetation due to widespread agricultural development. Loss of terrestrial vegetation modifies channel shading, in-stream habitat, and the quantity and composition of organic carbon (i. e. energy) subsidies provided to stream food webs. Collectively, these changes result in biodiversity loss and altered ecosystem functioning. Replanting riparian vegetation aims to alleviate the adverse ecological effects of riparian clearance. Replanting is already commonly used for ecological restoration, but revegetation may become more widespread if restoration activities are driven by economic forces, such as payments for planting trees to mitigate climate change. However, <b>replantings</b> currently are often spatially limited and isolated, so the plantings {{may not have a}} large effect on halting or reversing ecological degradation. Riparian clearance and revegetation are likely to alter carbon dynamics, which is a critical process underpinning biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in streams. We have little knowledge of if, and when, riparian replanting will restore in-stream organic-carbon processes towards pre-clearance conditions, or of the broad-scale effects on carbon balances. The integration of aquatic fluxes into regional carbon budgets is an important component of regional, national and global carbon accounting. I sought to: (1) quantify the reach-scale effects of replanting on in-stream organic carbon dynamics; (2) assess the potential for organic matter properties to reflect the success of restoring terrestrial-aquatic connectivity; and (3) upscale organic carbon fluxes to project the consequences of revegetation for carbon balance and atmospheric feedback at watershed (= catchment) scales. I assessed the dynamics of aquatic organic carbon (input, standing stock, export and metabolism) in 15 streams (1 st- 3 rd Strahler order) of an agricultural landscape in south-eastern Australia. Ten of the streams had reaches that were replanted with native woody vegetation 8 to 22 years prior to the study; I refer to these restored reaches as ‘replanted’ and other reaches in which there had been no plantings, pasture reaches, as ‘untreated’. Replanted stream reaches had greater inputs and accumulation of terrestrial organic carbon on the stream-bed than did untreated reaches. Replanting was correlated with a reduction in net ecosystem productivity and a shorter organic carbon turnover length. Within two decades of planting, metabolic rates in replanted reaches had values more typical of those in natural, forested streams, supporting the use of ecosystem metabolism as a functional indictor of restoration success at reach-scales. Metabolic measures could be combined with pattern-based measures, such as biodiversity, to demonstrate the ecological value of replanting. The export of organic carbon was governed by land-use and climatic variables at spatial scales larger than typical replanting projects. Watershed tree cover affected the composition of dissolved organic matter, but not its quantity. A greater proportion of the dissolved organic matter in agricultural streams was from within the stream and a reduced proportion was from terrestrial vegetation, compared to streams in forested watersheds. The characteristics of dissolved organic matter potentially provide an aggregate measure of aquatic and terrestrial connectivity over large spatial scales. The quantity of total organic carbon transported was controlled by discharge. Projected increases in rainfall variability will affect the timing and magnitude of storm-flows, altering the fluxes of energy subsidies among ecosystems in landscapes. The estimated organic carbon budget showed that replanted reaches potentially were a greater source of carbon than were untreated reaches (net change - 0. 52 g C m- 2 day- 1 ± 0. 80 SD). At a watershed scale, this increased carbon loss per unit area of stream was small compared to organic carbon export from 3 rd-order streams. Riparian restoration at reach spatial scales (i. e. 100 s of m) can restore ecosystem processes towards pre-clearance condition, within two decades. However, the effects of replanting at small scales may be overwhelmed by changes to hydrologic processes arising from probable increased climate variability in the future. Addressing land-use effects requires a landscape perspective that incorporates spatial context and connectivity at multiple scales to guide restoration activities into the areas likely to provide the greatest ecological return for investment...|$|E
