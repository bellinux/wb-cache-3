Corporate-source income tax compliance is high because of third party reporting, however, while noncorporate <b>rental</b> <b>income</b> <b>tax</b> compliance is low.

To measure this effect, we build a numerical general equilibrium model where households simultaneously choose portfolios of risky assets and fractions of income to report. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of imputed rental income from owner-occupied housing and its taxation on income distribution in Finland. Using micro-data from the 2004 Wealth Survey produced by Statistics Finland we find that owner-occupied housing has {{a significant impact on}} the well-being of many households. In 2004 imputed rental income constituted on average about 10 percent of homeowner households? disposable income. Furthermore, including imputed rental income to household disposable income decreased overall inequality measured by the Gini index. The estimated tax revenue forgone in 2004 was 1. 9 billion euros amounting to almost 15 percent of the total government income and wealth tax revenue collected that year. On the other hand, the tax subsidy resulting from non-taxation of imputed rental income is skewed toward high-income households who are more likely to be homeowners and also more likely to own outright. The paper also made a comparison of the current tax system where imputed rental income is untaxed to two alternative tenure neutral tax systems where imputed rental income is taxed. The results indicate that the effects on overall inequality depend vitally on the way the increased tax revenue is transferred back to the households. The calculations in this paper ignore any behavioural responses by the households. JEL Codes: H 23, H 24, R 21. Imputed <b>rental</b> <b>income,</b> <b>tax</b> subsidy, income distribution...|$|E

40|$|The {{dissemination}} of robust real estate data {{can help to}} improve market efficiency and investment analysis. To provide a perspective on property prices, a long series is vital. While long commercial and residential real estate data series are available, agricultural land is less well served. Comparable series describing long-term price and return histories for farmland in England are fragmented. We redress this data deficiency after considering the methodological complexities involved. The study employs a chain-linking approach to construct a long-term farmland price series for England. It then adjusts the series for inflation to examine real land prices. The resulting two-century series of English farmland prices establishes a basis for a more efficient farmland market analysis. Notwithstanding issues around long-run chain component heterogeneity, the combined series illuminates English average farmland price dynamics and changing land market fortunes. For {{more than two centuries}} English land price real capital returns were positive. Farmland real price growth was 0. 33 per cent annually from 1781 to 2013 and 0. 71 per cent from 1801 to 2013 as measured by the geometric mean.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to make an assessment of tax justice among real estate owners on the basis of comparison of the method of taxation in accordance with § 7 and § 9 (§ 10) of the <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> Act. Two different methods of income taxation were evaluated – <b>rental</b> <b>income</b> and income from the sale of property. Differences in total tax payments were affected by some other compulsory payments, i. e. social insurance and health insurance. Of importance is also § 4 of the <b>Income</b> <b>Tax</b> Act, according to which incomes from the sale of property are tax-exempt if the condition of the length of ownership or the condition of permanent residence is satisfied. Whereas the tax liability of the sole trader (i. e. taxes, social insurance and health insurance) was over 40 %, the tax liability of the taxpayer paying taxes in accordance with § 9 was 1. 20 %. An increase would be caused by the obligation to pay health insurance provided <b>rental</b> <b>income</b> was the only source of taxable income. For the taxpayer it is advantageous to <b>tax</b> <b>income</b> in accordance with § 9 and not § 7 because he can deduct the same expenses as the sole trader. The same was evident when sales in accordance with § 7 and § 10 were compared. Even if in § 10 no exemption was granted in compliance with § 4, there is still difference in social insurance paid. Model examples were also used to illustrate tax injustice among taxpayers {{with the same kind of}} income, which contradicts the horizontal principle in the Czech Republic.
