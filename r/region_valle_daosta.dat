The Italian electoral system and some of its drawbacks The Italian electoral law, like many others (for example, Mexico, Germany, Switzerland), wishes to achieve a double proportionality: on the one hand, Parliament seats should be assigned to parties, within each regional constituency, proportionally to the votes cast for the individual parties in the constituency; on the other hand, the amount of national seats obtained by any given party should be distributed among the different constituencies proportionally to the votes obtained by the party in the single constituencies. According to the Italian Constitution the size of the Chamber of Deputies is equal to 630 seats. The country is partitioned into 27 multi-member regional constituencies and the number of seats at stake in each regional constituency is proportional to the number of inhabitants, as provided by the latest population census. The only exception is the <b>region</b> of <b>Valle</b> <b>dAosta</b> which is a single-member district. Finally, 12 seat...|$|R

40|$|This paper shows from a methodological {{point of}} view the {{outcomes}} of the technical-environmental feasibility study for {{the location of the}} New Hospital of <b>Region</b> <b>Valle</b> d’Aosta in the North-West of Italy. The most important goal {{of this study was to}} support the decision making process about the hypothesis of spotting the hospital in four different areas identified by <b>Region</b> <b>Valle</b> d’Aosta. The analysis of the areas has been carried out referring to physical (size and environmental system), organizational-functional (functional frame of the territory, network facilities supply, health services, accessibility) and legal aspects (properties and constraints), in order to interpret all the information of these contexts without overlooking the territorial and environmental standards and laws. The most satisfying hypothesis of location with reference to the conditions emerging from the analytical steps has been defined by a comparative matrix, in which every aspect has been assessed by a qualitative judgement. In order to give the complexity of the transformability conditions of the four areas, the judgement has been scaled in different levels. Furthermore this paper outlines how a multricriteria evaluation tool can steer the decision making process to the principle of clearness, making possible to run through again all its own steps...|$|R

The 2002 SAM is used to simulate several scenarios which stress the importance of the main regional resources and suggest interventions to foster the diffusion of advanced technologies and promote synergies within local enterprises. ...|$|R

Measured at Local Health Authority level the levels varied between 5% and more than 60%. This geographic variability was the greatest of any of the 11 countries studied by the OECD. There is evidence of patient movement, generally from south to north, probably driven, at least in part, by a search for better quality.|$|R

A historical calibration procedure is performed over the 40 years period and a validation exercise ensures that the modelled tendencies closely approximate the actual observed growth patterns of the main regional macroeconomic variables. The dynamic general equilibrium model provides an original and powerful tool for historical counterfactual analysis not available using standard dynamic general equilibrium models. The model is {{used to compare the}} growth path followed by the region during the period of interest with different scenarios intended to rank the social desirability of alternative behaviours of the regional administration. historical calibration, historical validation, regional dynamic general equilibrium model, historical counterfactual analysis...|$|R

Malbec wines from same regions exhibited particular characteristics. Valles Calchaquíes wines had strong herbal, spicy, sweet pepper aromas and pungency in contrast to San Juan wines that showed fruity, strawberry, honey and citrus aromas. Mendoza del Este and Valle de Uco wines were associated with cooked fruit, raisin, floral and sweetness attributes as opposed to Mendoza del Sur and Patagonia wines which were characterized by sourness, bitterness, persistency and astringency and not by aroma attributes. Alto Río Mendoza wines were characterized by pungency, sweet pepper and bitterness...|$|R

Agave juice employed in this work {{was derived from the}} same harvest at agave cultivation lands in the <b>region</b> <b>Valles,</b> Jalisco Mexico. It was conserved frozen in a big chamber at − 20  °C and subsequently defrosted and filtered. Fermentation and propagation media consisted of agave juice adjusted with distilled water to 100 and 30  g L− 1 of reducing sugars, respectively. Ammonium sulfate (1  g L− 1, MP Biomedicals, Aurora OH, USA) and ammonium phosphate monobasic (4  g L− 1, Productos Químicos Monterrey, Monterrey, Mexico) were added to both media. Yeast extract (4  g L− 1, with a nitrogen content of 440  mg L− 1; Becton, Dickinson and Company, Cuautitlán Izcalli, Mexico) was also supplemented to the fermentation medium. The nitrogen requirement of this yeast strain was previously investigated (Morán-Marroquín et al. 2008). Media were sterilized by autoclaving at 121  °C during 15  min.|$|R
