25|$|Example {{applications}} of {{both types of}} flash memory include personal computers, PDAs, digital audio players, digital cameras, mobile phones, synthesizers, video games, scientific instrumentation, industrial robotics, and medical electronics. In addition to being non-volatile, flash memory offers fast <b>read</b> <b>access</b> times, although not as fast as static RAM or ROM. Its mechanical shock resistance helps explain its popularity over hard disks in portable devices, as does its high durability, ability to withstand high pressure, temperature and immersion in water, etc.|$|E

[...] TFTP is often installed with controls such that only files that have public <b>read</b> <b>access</b> are available via TFTP. Also listing, deleting, renaming, and writing files via TFTP are typically disallowed. TFTP file transfers are not recommended where the inherent protocol limitations could raise insurmountable liability concerns.|$|E

50|$|MVCC {{provides}} {{point in}} time consistent views. Read transactions under MVCC typically use a timestamp or transaction ID to determine what state of the DB to read, and read these versions of the data. Read and write transactions are thus isolated from each other without any need for locking. Writes create a newer version, while concurrent <b>reads</b> <b>access</b> the older version.|$|R

50|$|Several {{computer}} processes or threads may {{access the}} same database concurrently. Several <b>read</b> <b>accesses</b> can be satisfied in parallel. A write access {{can only be}} satisfied if no other accesses are currently being serviced. Otherwise, the write access fails with an error code (or can automatically be retried until a configurable timeout expires). This concurrent access situation would change when dealing with temporary tables. This restriction is relaxed in version 3.7 when write-ahead logging (WAL) is turned on enabling concurrent reads and writes.|$|R
25|$|Comprehensiveness {{can refer}} {{to the number of}} entries in a database. On those terms, a crystal {{structure}} database can be regarded as comprehensive, if it contains a collection of all (re-)published crystal structures in the category of interest and is updated frequently. Searching for structures in such a database can replace more time-consuming scanning of the open literature. Access to crystal structure databases differs widely. It can be divided into <b>reading</b> and writing <b>access.</b> Reading access rights (search, download) affect the number and range of users. Restricted <b>reading</b> <b>access</b> is often coupled with restricted usage rights. Writing access rights (upload, edit, delete), on the other hand, determine the number and range of contributors to the database. Restricted writing access is often coupled with high data integrity.|$|R
30|$|Graphs {{are used}} to model {{a wide range of}} systems from {{different}} disciplines including social network analysis, biology, and big data processing. When analyzing these constantly changing dynamic graphs at a high frequency, performance is the main concern. Depending on the graph size and structure, update frequency, and <b>read</b> <b>accesses</b> of the analysis, the use of different data structures can yield great performance variations. Even for expert programmers, it is not always obvious, which data structure is the best choice for a given scenario.|$|R
50|$|Since all users {{must have}} <b>read</b> <b>access</b> to the /etc/passwd file to do many common tasks (ls -l /home will use /etc/passwd to map UIDs to login names for example), anyone could also read the {{password}} hashes of other users. To solve this problem, the file /etc/shadow {{was created to}} store the password hashes, with only root having <b>read</b> <b>access.</b> Under password shadowing, the 2nd field (password hash) is replaced by an 'x' which tells the system to retrieve the corresponding user's password via the /etc/shadow file.|$|E

30|$|Another unique {{capability}} of our architecture {{is that it}} supports conflict resolution of <b>read</b> <b>accesses.</b> As mentioned before, conflict resolution is essential when handling streams at high-speed. Read-access conflict resolution allows data interleaving during memory read-out at high-speed. Being able to both write data interleaved to and read data interleaved from the memory allows implementation of two interleaving functions in a single iteration over the memory. Also complex interleavers or demultiplex/interleave scenarios can be supported at high-speeds. The use case of 4 simultaneous DVB-T radios significantly benefits from this capability, combining symbol and bit de-interleaving.|$|R
