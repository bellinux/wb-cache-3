50|$|After {{arriving}} at the University North Carolina, Aldrich’s research shifted toward a greater focus on entrepreneurship, inspired in part by colleagues at entrepreneurship conferences such as the Babson Conference. One of his most well-known works, “Entrepreneurship through social networks", conceptualized business creation as an outcome of opportunity structures and access to resources obtained through key connecting relationships. Relatedly, Aldrich wrote extensively on family business, gender, and race issues of entrepreneurship, and social ties in small business creation. He was heavily influenced by his colleagues at UNC, particularly Glen Elder, who pioneered the approach called life course studies, and Amos Hawley, a pioneering <b>researcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> ecology.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to present some reflections on the process of constitution of the <b>researcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> sciences, minted from a view anchored in the historical-cultural psychology, and in the dialogue with some of Bakhtin’s ideas and writings of some of his interlocutors. From these reflections arise the understanding that researching is a dialogical and ideological process, in which the research and the researcher are mutually constituted in the relation of authorship/alterity. We also comprehend that the production of knowledge is always a singular creation with collective contributions, and as the researcher signs the authorship of a research or text, he finds himself in a position of responding to the other and also of responsibility for what he has produced. Finally, we assert that the constitution of the <b>researcher</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> sciences has attributes peculiar to this field of knowledge, since his relation with the subjects and contexts researched is sustained by ethical, aesthetic and political choices...|$|E

40|$|Introduction In a {{cluttered}} scene {{it may not}} {{be possible}} to segment objects without assistance from top-down processes (Barrow & Tenenbaum, 1981; Marr, 1982; Spelke, 1990; Ullman, 1997; Borenstein & Ullman, 2002; Bravo & Farid, 2003). Consider Figure 1 which shows a scene composed of several familiar objects with similar colors and textures. Note that because the objects occlude one another, parts from different objects are intermingled. If bottom-up grouping processes alone were used to organize this scene, it seems unlikely that the result would correspond to the familiar objects that we perceive. Although <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> vision have largely ignored the problems of segmenting and recognizing objects in clutter (c. f., (Brady & Kersten, 2003)), a number of <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> computer vision have proposed approaches to this problem (Roberts, 1966; Lowe, 1985; Selinger & Nelson, 1999; Borenstein & Ullman, 2002). One such approach, sometimes termed "hypothesize-verify", involves the f...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Visual {{images are}} ambiguous. Any image, or {{collection}} of images, {{is consistent with}} {{an infinite number of}} possible scenes in the world. Yet we are generally unaware of this ambiguity. During ordinary perception we are generally aware of only one, or perhaps a few of these possibilities. Human vision evidently exploits certain constraintsöassumptions about the world and images formed of itö in order to generate its perceptions. One constraint that has been widely studied by <b>researchers</b> <b>in</b> <b>human</b> and machine vision is the generic-viewpoint assumption. We show that this assumption can help to explain the widely discussed fact that outlines of blobs are ineffective inducers of illusory contours. We also present a number of novel effects and report an experiment suggesting that the generic-viewpoint assumption strongly influences illusory-contour perception. ...|$|R

40|$|Attention is {{a concept}} of human {{perception}} that enables human subjects to select the potentially relevant parts out of the huge amount of sensory data and that enables interactions with other human subjects by sharing attention with each other. These abilities are also of large interest for autonomous robots, therefore, interest in modeling concepts of human attention computationally has increased strongly in the robotics community during the last decade.
