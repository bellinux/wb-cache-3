500|$|When Australia {{declared}} war in September 1939, Flight Lieutenant Balmer {{was a member}} of No.22 Squadron, which conducted coastal surveillance out of Richmond with Ansons and, later, CAC Wirraways. Promoted to squadron leader, he was posted to RAAF Station Darwin, Northern Territory, on 1June 1940, becoming the inaugural commander of No.13 Squadron, which had been [...] "cannibalised" [...] from the base's <b>resident</b> <b>unit,</b> No.12 Squadron. Retaining its Wirraway flight, No.12 Squadron gave up its two flights of Ansons to the new formation; these were replaced later that month by more capable Lockheed Hudsons. From August 1940 until February 1941, No.13 Squadron was responsible for patrolling the sea lanes off Australia's north coast. On occasion, Balmer detected Japanese luggers that were illegally fishing in Australian waters and, according to Mark Johnston, overflew them at such a low altitude that [...] "his Hudson's slipstream rocked the boats violently" [...] and the crew [...] "shook their fists" [...] at him. He was promoted to temporary wing commander in April. The following month, No.13 Squadron conducted familiarisation flights over the Dutch East Indies. [...] Balmer handed over command of the unit in August, and transferred to a liaison post at Headquarters RAAF Station Darwin.|$|E

5000|$|GNI {{is defined}} in {{accordance}} with the European system of national and regional accounts. GNI represents total primary income receivable by resident institutional units: compensation of employees, taxes on production and imports less subsidies, property income (interest, dividends and reinvested earnings from foreign direct investment receivable less payable), gross operating surplus and gross mixed income. It corresponds to the better known gross domestic product (GDP) minus primary income payable by <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> to non-resident units, plus primary income receivable by <b>resident</b> <b>units</b> {{from the rest of the}} world. Technically speaking, the GNI is a balancing item of the allocation of primary income account in the sequence of accounts for the total economy. Loosely speaking, it is the sum of domestic and foreign income earned by the resident population of a country. It is worth noting that GNI is income from productive activities excluding any capital gains and losses (also known as [...] "holding gains and losses") resulting from price changes of fixed or financial assets (for example: price changes on the stock market have no direct impact on GNI).|$|R

50|$|Udorn RTAFB {{was small}} and when a {{squadron}} of USAF F-104As was brought there, {{it was decided to}} send two flights, half of the 555th, to Ubon RTAFB. There was not enough billeting for the entire 555th at Ubon and what was available was not adequate for daytime rest. The 8 TFW was the <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> at Ubon and were flying only night missions (Night Owl) into North Vietnam. During the first two weeks at Ubon, the 555th flew day strikes into North Vietnam. A barracks-type building was hastily constructed to house the entire 555th and the remaining half of the squadron was brought to Ubon in July 1966, at which time the entire squadron began flying Night Owl missions. However, the new building was not air conditioned, so the 555th flew from sunset to about 2300 hours local time. The two squadrons of the 8 TFW flew the missions from 2300 to sunrise. Later in 1966, the 555th was transferred from the 12 TFW to the 8 TFW.|$|E

40|$|The new {{residential}} property price in Hong Kong has rocketed {{in the last}} decade and has ranked within the top three metropolitan cities in the world. Housing is a necessity for most people, high {{residential property}} price has its social ramification. The rocketing price seems not solely the result of the market. As such, this raised the issue of competition in this market. This study employs Concentration Ratio and Hirfindahl-Hirschman index to evaluate the market concentration of the New Private <b>Resident</b> <b>Units</b> Market in Hong Kong. Using the best information available in the public domains and applying universal thresholds, the New Private <b>Resident</b> <b>Units</b> Market in Hong Kong is considered moderately concentrated. It is noted that the big five listed developers in Hong Kong are collectively holding a dominant position of the potential supply. Moreover, the top three have comparable market shares thus suggesting no monopoly exists. It is also found that the substantial land banks held by the five big listed developers, amount to 60 % of that owned by the Government. These developers will therefore retain their dominant market power in the future. Further study is recommended to examine whether the big developers have abused their market power...|$|R

50|$|Based on the non-fiction book {{originally}} titled Under the Sabers: The Unwritten Code of Army Wives, by Tanya Biank, {{the series}} is set at fictional Fort Marshall, at the old Charleston Naval Base, in North Charleston, South Carolina, home to the also fictional 23rd Airborne Division, a component unit of the XVII Airborne Corps. The show itself is filmed in various locations such as the Charleston Air Force Base (now Charleston Field) and the sound stage off Dorchester Road in the City of North Charleston. Some scenes have been shot {{in and around the}} City of Charleston. In Season 5 the 23rd is disbanded and the 32nd Airborne Division becomes the new <b>resident</b> <b>unit,</b> having moved to Fort Marshall from the fictional Fort Hope. The 23rd Airborne Division, XVII Airborne Corps and Fort Marshall are presumably based on the actual 82nd Airborne Division, XVIII Airborne Corps based at Fort Bragg, home of the airborne divisions and the United States Army Special Operations Command. In Season 7 Fort Marshall was merged with an Air Force base, mirroring the mergers of several Army posts with nearby Air Force bases {{as a result of the}} 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission.

40|$|Residence in a {{currency}} union and residence {{in a single}} economy 1. Being a resident of a country member of {{a currency}} union necessarily implies being a resident of this currency union. The question is asked {{as to whether the}} reverse is true, i. e. does being a <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> of a currency union imply being a <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> of at least one member country of the union? In other words, can the existence of a currency union create a residence status additional to the residence status of the component economies of the currency union? 2. In the first place, this paper discusses the issue of the residence status of a currency union central bank (CUCB) in a currency union. This paper also discusses the case of multiterritory enterprise, 1 for which the centre of economic interest is not clearly established and, in some cases, more closely related to the union as a whole than to any individual country.

40|$|The {{international}} activities of shipping companies are {{recorded in the}} balance of payments mainly under the transport services. However the usual practice for such companies to establish ‘branches ’ or ‘operating offices ’ to a number of countries as well as to be registered for flying flags of convenience for their vessels makes difficult to determine the residency (i. e. the country) to whom and to which country the activities of the shipping company would be allocated to. Furthermore, such a worldwide establishment of branches/offices raises the question of how these should be treated.

40|$|This paper {{draws on}} field study data {{to provide an}} {{examination}} of the condominium owner / manager relationship in the Australian tourism context. Although there has been considerable growth in tourism accommodation owned through strata-title, no research examining the somewhat idiosyncratic relationship between unit owners and resident managers has been found in the literature. The peculiar nature of the relationship underlines its significance as a context in which to apply the agency theoretical model. As Australian condominium <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> managers provide letting and caretaker services for condominium unit owners, it appears the relationship can be justifiably viewed as a principal-agent exchange (Mills, 1990). The study specifically focuses on strata title condominiums located in major tourism regions. This sub-sector of the condominium management industry was chosen for study because it exhibits several key attributes distinguishing it from the non-tourist based condominium sector. For example, two different parties represent the principal (resident owners and investor owners), also a significant proportion of a resident manager's work relates to the management of short-term holiday unit letting. In light of the particular agency relationship dynamics arising in large tourist-based condominium governance, several suggestions concerning the legal environment of the industry are provided.

40|$|Strata title units (dwelling {{complexes}} {{in which}} individual units {{are owned by}} small investors) represent the vast bulk of Australian self-catering tourism units. In many areas, such as Australia's Gold Coast, strata title owned properties have overtaken hotels as the most popular form of tourist accommodation (Warnken, J., Russell, R., Faulkner, B., 2003. Condominium developments in maturing destinations: potentials and problems of long term sustainability. Tourism Management 24, 155 - 168). Data were collected by interviewing <b>resident</b> <b>unit</b> managers (RUMs) in large strata title complexes in the Gold Coast. Significant findings were as follows: 1. Despite a significant normative literature on accounting-based approaches to setting room rates, {{there appeared to be}} a complete absence of accounting-based (e. g., "cost plus") accommodation price setting in the sample investigated. The pricing strategies applied in the sample can be viewed as largely 'intuitive' (Lewis, R. C., Chambers, R. E., 2000. Marketing Leadership in Hospitality, third ed. Wiley, New York) and 'unsophisticated' (Morrison, A. M., 2002. Hospitality and Travel Marketing, third ed. Delmar, Thomson Learning, New York). 2. Strata title complexes could be classified as either subject to a price making, or a price taking, philosophy. 3. The industry was characterised by significant price discounting which appears to be conducted in a largely ad hoc manner. 4. The pricing philosophy applied was contingent upon several key location factors. Additional observations related to room rate decision-making complications arising due to the diversity of stakeholders involved, the limited formal management training undertaken by the RUMs who are charged with the responsibility of setting room rates, and a lack of accountability to owners with respect to pricing issues. The study's significance derives from the paucity of prior research concerned with the strata title owned accommodation sector generally, and more especially the fact that no prior research work concerned with room rate formulation in this fast growing tourism accommodation sector has been found in the literatureGriffith Business School, Department of Tourism, Sport and Hotel ManagementFull Tex...|$|E
