40|$|On {{the basis}} of reports and resolutions {{produced}} by the two Goiás Audit Courts (one in charge of examining the State government accounts {{and the other in}} charge of local government accounts), this article examined the procedures adopted to evaluate the <b>revenue</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenditure</b> <b>accounts</b> for the maintenance and promotion of education. A number of inaccuracies, mistakes and inconsistencies were found which have resulted, and continue to result, in less funding available for education. The Audit Court in charge of examining State government accounts, for example, {{for a number of years}} in the 1990 s, did not take into consideration federal tax transfers to the State in its calculation of the minimum percentage rate linked to education. In addition, the Court also erred by including a payroll-linked contribution to education in the calculation, as this is a social contribution and not a tax. In its calculation of the 25 % of revenue to be spent on education, the Court continued to include the payment of retired education personnel as an educational expense at least until 2008, even though a resolution issued by the said Court in 2001 excluded such payment from the legally-defined concept of educational maintenance and promotion. The Audit Court in charge of local government accounts also made a number of mistakes, both in <b>revenue</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenditure,</b> in its 1998 number 1 resolution. O artigo examinou, com base em relatórios de contas, resoluções e ofícios dos Tribunais de Contas do Estado (TCE) e dos Municípios (TCM) de Goiás, os procedimentos que adotam na avaliação das receitas e despesas vinculadas à manutenção e desenvolvimento do ensino (MDE), constatando uma série de imprecisões, equívocos e inconsistências que resultaram e resultam em menos recursos para a educação. O TCE, por exemplo, por vários anos na década de 1990, deixou de incluir na base de cálculo do percentual mínimo vinculado à MDE as transferências federais de impostos assim como errou, ao incluir nessa base, o salário-educação, que é contribuição social, não imposto. Além disso, continuou a aceitar o pagamento dos inativos no cálculo dos 25 % pelo menos até 2008, embora resolução sua de 2001 excluísse tal pagamento do conceito de MDE.

40|$|The {{extent to}} which growth reduces poverty has been disputed for years, as has the {{controversy}} surrounding trade-offs between policies that seek growth and those that address equity. Structural models linking economic growth {{and the distribution of}} income <b>and</b> <b>expenditure</b> are relatively recent and have not been exploited. This paper exploits this literature by adapting and extending it to a multisector growth model with intermediate inputs, composite capital, <b>and</b> government <b>revenue</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenditures,</b> while <b>accounting</b> for income <b>and</b> <b>expenditure,</b> by quintile, of households in the modeled economy. The model is fit to Ghanaian data. We find that about 50 years are required to double income per worker, while lower- and upper-quintile levels of household income tend to converge modestly toward mean household income over time. Nevertheless, the dispersion of income remains relatively high in the long run. The sensitivity of these results to productivity shocks favoring agriculture shows that increasing labor productivity leads to growth with little change in the distribution of income relative to the base solution. Increasing land productivity and decreasing protection of the industrial sector do not alter the basic trends but do tend to cause the lower-income groups to fall further below �new� mean income and the higher-income group to exceed mean income relative to the base solution.

The following part describes municipal <b>revenues</b> <b>and</b> <b>expenditures,</b> the closing <b>account,</b> municipal management review and the municipality's attitude to drawing of grants.

The subsequent empiric part describes economic activities of the town of Jirkov in years 2010 _ 2014 with focus on expenditures related to investments. These expenditures are decisive in relation to the accepted grants. In the given period, grants had a significant influence on the municipal budget and to a large extent contributed to the budget preparation, and planning and implementing of investments.
