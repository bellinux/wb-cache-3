40|$|AbstractRegardless the {{extensive}} literature in project management, {{the model for}} cost estimation remains unclear and unexploited mainly in terms of simple methods. Accuracy effort and schedule estimation is still a challenge. This paper introduces stream lining procedures from project work breakdown structure (WBS) evaluating the duration processes and either the input cost hour or the fixed costs. The measures are made via hypothesis testing over the <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>matrix</b> (RAM). We propose a method for project cost construction using a spreadsheet to create an early-stage budget allocation. In this paper we argue that the simulated cost results present superior accuracy while establishing {{the applicability of the}} proposed simulation procedure. Generally, the precision is related with the WBS detailed design. The cost methodology approach offers a simplified decision tool for assessing the construction cost on the project managers’ decision...|$|E
50|$|The matrix is {{typically}} created with a vertical axis (left-hand column) of tasks (e.g., from a {{work breakdown structure}} WBS) or deliverables (e.g., from a product breakdown structure PBS), and a horizontal axis (top row) of roles (e.g., from an organizational chart) - as illustrated in the image of an example <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> (or RACI) <b>matrix.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to managing technical and schedule performance, large and complex projects require that cost performance be monitored and reviewed at regular intervals. To measure cost performance, planned value (or BCWS - Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled) and earned value (or BCWP - Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) {{must be in}} units of currency (the same units that actual costs are measured.) In large implementations, the planned value curve is commonly called a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) and may be arranged in control accounts, summary-level planning packages, planning packages and work packages. In large projects, establishing control accounts is the primary method of delegating responsibility and authority to {{various parts of the}} performing organization. Control accounts are cells of a <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> (RACI) <b>matrix,</b> which is the intersection of the project WBS and the organizational breakdown structure (OBS). Control accounts are assigned to Control Account Managers (CAMs). Large projects require more elaborate processes for controlling baseline revisions, more thorough integration with subcontractor EVM systems, and more elaborate management of procured materials.|$|R

40|$|The {{telecommunication}} {{industry in}} Indonesia is growing {{rapidly in the}} last fifteen years. The habit slowly changed from voice and short messaging service into data. Nowadays, {{the challenge for the}} telecommunication company is to provide good quality of network. To fulfill the challenge, XL has been developing a partnerships scheme with suppliers and has been creating a performance measurement to keep partnerships work in the right path. The last supplier performance measurement report shows that the result is not meet the target. The unsatisfying result show that something wrong in the partnership with supplier. To find the core problem, this paper uses a Current Reality Tree (CRT) method. Based on CRT analysis, the core problem that arises is poor coordination. To eliminate core problem, a strategy is created. Strategic Supply Management is used as a framework to create strategy in eliminating core problem. Four critical enablers in the strategic supply management are analyzed to find solution for the problem. Those four critical enablers are organizational design, supply measurements, information systems, and human resources. The suggested and recommended solution based on analysis are improvement in business process, developing <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>matrix</b> (RAM), create web-based application, and developing skill and knowledge people in supply organization...|$|E
40|$|The Department of Energy (DOE) has {{produced}} {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) for many years {{as part of its}} various missions and programs. The historical process for managing this SNF was to reprocess it whereby valuable material such as uranium or plutonium was chemically separated from the wastes. These fuels were not intended for long-term storage. As the need for uranium and plutonium decreased, it became necessary to store the SNF for extended lengths of time. This necessity resulted from a 1992 DOE decision to discontinue reprocessing SNF to recover strategic materials (although limited processing of SNF to meet repository acceptance criteria remains under consideration, no plutonium or uranium extraction for other uses is planned). Both the facilities used for storage, and the fuel itself, began experiencing aging from this extended storage. New efforts are now necessary to assure suitable fuel and facility management until long-term decisions for spent fuel disposition are made and implemented. The Program Plan consists of 14 sections as follows: Sections 2 [...] 6 describe objectives, management, the work plan, the work breakdown structure, and the <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> <b>matrix.</b> Sections 7 [...] 9 describe the program summary schedules, site logic diagram, SNF Program resource and support requirements.

40|$|Comau S. p. A. -Powertrain- (PWT) mainly manages its {{projects}} on a multinational level. In the past, several issues were identified {{some of which}} {{can be attributed to the}} complexity of a matrix organizational structure. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate whether PWT project teams are still experiencing certain issues while working in multi-country projects and to develop certain proposals for improvement by analysing the possible causes. For this purpose a survey was conducted among project participants to identify the present issues and to discover the reasons for their occurrence. In addition, an analysis of cultural differences was performed also based on secondary data to examine the influences of cultural differences on employees’ perceptions. The results of the analysis indicated that some of the project teams are still facing certain issues while collaborating across regions and functions. Therefore, the importance of a better communication of certain defined roles was identified. In addition, an increasing awareness of the <b>Responsibility</b> <b>Assignment</b> <b>Matrix</b> (RAM) as a tool for also obtaining the overall agreement of project responsibilities and as team building measure was recognized as important. Moreover, to obtain new insights into present issues from the perspectives of the project teams and for further research purpose, the execution of a workshop including all survey participants was stated as potentially worthwhile...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of {{object-oriented}} analysis and design (OOAD), class <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> {{is not an easy}} skill to acquire. Though there are many methodologies for assigning responsibilities to classes, they all rely on human judgment and decision making. Our objective is to provide decision-making support to re-assign methods and attributes to classes in a class diagram. Our solution is based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) and uses class coupling and cohesion measurement for defining fitness functions. Our MOGA takes as input a class diagram to be optimized and suggests possible improvements to it. The choice of a MOGA {{stems from the fact that}} there are typically many evaluation criteria that cannot be easily combined into one objective, and several alternative solutions are acceptable for a given OO domain model. Using a carefully selected case study, this article investigates the application of our proposed MOGA to the class <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> problem, in {{the context of}} object-oriented analysis and domain class models. Our results suggest that the MOGA can help correct suboptimal class <b>responsibility</b> <b>assignment</b> decisions and perform far better than simpler alternative heuristics such as hill climbing and a single objective GA. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} generalized multiple description coding of image data, in which an image is encoded into M descriptions sent over M unreliable channels, and any description subset is useful in reconstructing an approximation of the original image.

Instead of using a straightforward M-description generalization with hypercubes, we propose to encode a quantizer index in a multistage fashion, each stage doubling the number of descriptions.
