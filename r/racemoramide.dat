50|$|<b>Racemoramide</b> (INN, BAN), {{or simply}} moramide, is an opioid {{analgesic}} and a racemic {{mixture of the}} substances dextromoramide (the active component) and levomoramide (which is inactive), two enantiomers of a chiral molecule.|$|E
50|$|Dextromoramide is the {{right-handed}} isomer of the moramide molecule. The left-handed molecule {{is called}} levomoramide, and {{a mixture of}} the two is called <b>racemoramide.</b> Its full chemical name is (+)-1-(3-Methyl-4-morpholino-2,2-diphenylbutyryl)pyrrolidine, and its molecular formula: C25H32N2O2, with an atomic weight of ~392.5.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Racemoramide</b> {{is itself}} controlled; in the United States {{it is under}} Schedule I as a Narcotic with an ACSCN of 9645 and a zero annual {{aggregate}} manufacturing quota as of 2014. Its salts are the bitartrate (free base conversion ratio 0.723) and dihydrochloride (0.843) ...|$|E
50|$|So dextromoramide, with a {{pyrrolidine}} {{ring on the}} 1-amide position, a dextro methyl {{group on}} the 3-position of the alkyl chain, a morpholine ring around the 4-amine group, and both phenyl rings unsubstituted, {{was by far the}} most potent out of all the compounds in this series and {{was the only one that}} became widely used in medicine (although the racemic mix <b>racemoramide</b> saw some limited use).|$|E
5000|$|The only European {{countries}} that now use the brand palfium are the Netherlands, Ireland and Luxembourg. It is presumably {{able to be}} imported into other Schengen zone countries under Title 76 of said treaty coming into force in 2002. It is a Schedule I Narcotic controlled substance in the United States, with a DEA ACSCN of 9613 and an annual aggregate manufacturing quota of zero as of 2013, and {{had been out of}} use in the United States for around a decade when the new Controlled Substances Act 1970 was promulgated. The salts of dextromoramide in use are the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.915) and tartrate (0.724). [...] <b>Racemoramide</b> and moramide intermediate are also controlled.|$|E
