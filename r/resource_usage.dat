5|$|The Ecological {{footprint}} measures {{human consumption}} {{in terms of}} the biologically productive land needed to provide the resources, and absorb the wastes of the average global citizen. In 2008 it required 2.7 global hectares per person, 30% more than the natural biological capacity of 2.1 global hectares (assuming no provision for other organisms). The resulting ecological deficit must be met from unsustainable extra sources and these are obtained in three ways: embedded in the goods and services of world trade; taken from the past (e.g. fossil fuels); or borrowed from the future as unsustainable <b>resource</b> <b>usage</b> (e.g. by over exploiting forests and fisheries).|$|E

It secured AV-TEST certification on October 2009, having demonstrated {{its ability}} to eliminate all widely encountered malware. However, it lost the certificate on October 2012, having shown a constant decline in protection and repair scores. In June 2013, MSE achieved the lowest possible protection score, zero. According to a March 2012 report by anti-malware specialist OPSWAT, MSE {{was the most popular}} AV product in North America and the second most popular in the world, which has resulted in the appearance of several rogue antivirus programs that try to impersonate it.|$|E

25|$|One {{big factor}} that determines the <b>resource</b> <b>usage</b> {{and speed of}} a desktop {{distribution}} is the desktop environment it uses. For example, version 10.10 of Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop and requires a minimum of 128MB of RAM and a PentiumII processor, though the Lubuntu project recommends 256MB - 384MB for a usable system, and at least 512MB for optimal performance; it is a lightweight variant of Ubuntu that, in comparison, uses Unity as a desktop environment and requires a 2GHz processor and 2GB of RAM. The desktop environment can be changed in most Linux distributions, and the same Linux distribution may also have various versions with different desktop environments; examples are Porteus, which comes in LXDE, Xfce and Mate versions, and Zenwalk, which comes in Xfce and Openbox versions.|$|E

Education, training and enforcement of environmental protection laws {{needs to be more}} effective to ensure sustainable methods of cultivating and harvesting natural resources within the wetlands cause no further loss of biodiversity. Weak enforcement of regulations, lack of coordinated programming and inadequate data collection and record keeping have previously been identified as key issues of concern in the management of this ecosystem, however it is unknown if these problems have been addressed in recent times. Immediate management concerns should focus on preserving biodiversity, improving water quality, preserving fishery resources and resolving social conflicts arising from <b>resource</b> <b>usage</b> in the area. There are pockets of land within the protected area that remain in conflict between government authorities and locals due to missing land tenure documentation and non-adherence to environmental policies such as illegal land clearing, overfishing, not following designated boat routes and polluting the wetlands.|$|E

25|$|Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 also {{includes}} a historical debugger for managed code called IntelliTrace. Unlike a traditional debugger that records only the currently active stack, IntelliTrace records all events, such as prior function calls, method parameters, events and exceptions. This allows the code execution to be rewound in case a breakpoint was not set where the error occurred. Debugging with IntelliTrace causes the application to run more slowly than debugging without it, and uses more memory as additional data needs to be recorded. Microsoft allows configuration of how much data should be recorded, in effect, allowing developers to balance the speed of execution and <b>resource</b> <b>usage.</b> The Lab Management component of Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 uses virtualization to create a similar execution environment for testers and developers. The virtual machines are tagged with checkpoints which can later be investigated for issues, {{as well as to}} reproduce the issue. Visual Studio Ultimate 2010 {{also includes}} the capability to record test runs that capture the specific state of the operating environment as well as the precise steps used to run the test. These steps can then be played back to reproduce issues.|$|E

Predicting resources is necessary because cloud infrastructures use virtual resources on demand. Current monitoring tools are insucient to predict <b>resources</b> <b>usage</b> of virtualized system.

2500|$|There {{are several}} key {{differences}} in {{management of resources}} in the global commons {{from those of the}} commons, in general. There are obvious differences in scale of both the resources and the number of users at the local versus the global level. [...] Also, there are differences in the shared culture and expectations of resource users; more localized commons users tend to be more homogeneous and global users more heterogeneous. This contributes to differences in the possibility and time it takes for new learning about <b>resource</b> <b>usage</b> to occur at the different levels. Moreover, global resource pools {{are less likely to be}} relatively stable and the dynamics are less easily understood. Many of the global commons are non-renewable on human time scales. Thus, resource degradation is more likely to be the result of unintended consequences that are unforeseen, not immediately observable, or not easily understood. For example, the carbon dioxide emissions that drive climate change continue to do so for at least a millennium after they enter the atmosphere and species extinctions last forever. [...] Importantly, because there are significant differences in the benefits, costs, and interests at the global level, there are significant differences in externalities between more local resource uses and uses of global-level resources.|$|E
