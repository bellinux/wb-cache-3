The local assembly of Nago voted against the <b>relocation</b> <b>plan,</b> and the prefectural assembly of Okinawa also formally asked the prime minister to move the base out of the prefecture. On 17 May 2010, {{the anniversary of the}} reversion of Okinawa to Japan, an estimated 17,000 Okinawans encircled the base in protest. This was the fifth time such an action took place.|$|E

25|$|In a {{non-binding}} referendum {{conducted in}} December 1997, {{the majority of}} Nago residents voted against the Henoko <b>relocation</b> <b>plan.</b> However, {{a few days later}} on December 24, Nago Mayor Tetuya Higa ignored the referendum results and accepted the <b>relocation</b> <b>plan,</b> resigned, and moved to Tokyo. The next year Tateo Kishimoto was elected mayor of Nago and tried to find compromises regarding the relocation. So did his successor Yoshikazu Shimabukuro, {{at a time when the}} Prefecture Governor, Masahide Ota, was opposed to the Henoko relocation. The next mayor too, Susumu Inamine, was opposed to it and he was elected twice with a high margin on an anti-base agenda.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} a growing {{interest}} towards relocation of government activities - moving civil service jobs away from capital to provincial regions, so from center to more peripheral regions - in Finland. Similar plans were made in the 1960 s and 1970 s, but they remained largely unimplemented. The aim {{of this paper is to}} examine the theoretical origins of these older <b>relocation</b> <b>plans</b> and to assess relocation of government activities as a tool in Finnish regional policy. Consideration is given to potential weak points and reasons behind the non-implementation of the <b>relocation</b> <b>plans.</b> ...|$|R
25|$|Before World War II, Germany {{considered}} mass deportation from Europe of German, {{and later}} European, Jewry. Among the areas considered for possible resettlement were British Palestine, and French Madagascar. After the war began, German leaders considered deporting Europe's Jews to Siberia. Palestine {{was the only}} location to which any German <b>relocation</b> <b>plan</b> produced results, via the Haavara Agreement between the Zionist Federation of Germany and the German government. This resulted in the transfer of about 60,000 German Jews and $100million from Germany to Palestine, but it ended with the outbreak of World WarII.|$|E
25|$|The {{mayor of}} Nago, which hosts Camp Schwab, {{formally}} agreed {{to accept the}} relocation when he {{signed an agreement with}} Defense Minister Nukaga on 8 April 2006. Mayor Shimabukuro was later joined by all five of the major mayors of northern Okinawa. Although some all-Okinawa public opinion polls indicated that majority of Okinawans wish the based moved out of the prefecture entirely, all 12 elected mayors of northern Okinawa publicly accepted the new <b>relocation</b> <b>plan,</b> exposing a range of conflicting opinions among Okinawans: those who maintain that military facilities and associated public works infrastructure benefit the island's economy, environmentalists, and those who either object or are critical to the U.S. military presence on ideological grounds or on rooted sentiments.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the {{chairman}} and ranking member of the United States Senate Committee on Armed Services called for an alternative plan where Futenma aircraft would move to Kadena Air Base while the current aircraft at Kadena would move to Andersen Air Force Base. However, US and Japan governments remained with the <b>relocation</b> <b>plan</b> as previously agreed {{and the fate of}} Futenma remained unresolved through early 2012, with the U.S. insisting that the Marine Corps' aviation elements be kept on the island while the Okinawa Prefectural government and Nago City government would like the base moved off the island. The US alleged that the aviation elements should be in close proximity to the ground and logistics elements of the Marine Air Ground Task Force, and the Japanese government of the time maintained the plan to keep the replacement airbase within Okinawa.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{withdrawal}} of the Leazes Park plan, the club proposed expansion of St James' Park to over 52,000 capacity, through major construction of a second tier over the Milburn Stand, Leazes End and adjoining corner, adding to a structure that was itself just four years old. After a refusal by the Secretary of State to take the application to an enquiry, permission was obtained in July 1998. For minimal disruption to seating capacity during construction, the project required 3-day shutdowns of work on home match days. 750 seats were lost during construction. During this expansion, executive boxes in the East Stand were demolished and replaced by seating blocks from pitch level up to the existing rows, in a mirror image of the Milburn Stand. The executive boxes were transferred to the new Milburn/Leazes complex, with more added to the Gallowgate End. During development, the additional stand and roof was constructed while leaving the existing cantilever roof intact until the last possible moment These developments increased capacity to approximately 52,143. The construction was completed in July 2000 at a cost of £42 million. Ironically, after opposition from local residents to the <b>relocation</b> <b>plan,</b> the expansion of the current ground at the Leazes End has further reduced the view of Leazes Park from Leazes Terrace, although this is now student accommodation.|$|E
25|$|The only {{professional}} sporting team in Sunderland is {{the football}} team, Sunderland A.F.C., which {{was formed in}} 1879 and {{was elected to the}} Football League in 1890. The club, which currently plays in the Sky Bet Championship as of 29th April 2017 following relegation from the FA Premier League after losing to Bournemouth 1-0, is based at the 49,000 seat capacity Stadium of Light, which was opened in 1997. Sunderland A.F.C also has the north-east's top women's football team, Sunderland A.F.C. Women, They currently play in the top tier of English women's football – FA Women's Super League. Despite their financial struggles. Sunderland were league champions six times within the Football League's first half century, but have not achieved this accolade since 1936. Their other notable successes include FA Cup glory in 1937 and 1973 and winning the Division One title with a (then) English league record of 105 points in 1999. Sunderland's longest stadium occupancy so far was of Roker Park for 99 years beginning in 1898, with relocation taking place due to the stadium's confined location and the need to build an all-seater stadium. The initial <b>relocation</b> <b>plan,</b> announced in the early 1990s, had been for a stadium to be situated alongside the Nissan factory, but these were abandoned in favour of the Stadium of Light at Monkwearmouth on the site of a colliery {{on the banks of the}} River Wear that had closed at the end of 1993. The city also has two non-league sides, Sunderland Ryhope Community Association F.C. of the Northern League Division Two and Sunderland West End FC of the Wearside League, who play at the Ford Quarry Complex.|$|E
500|$|In English football, the {{relocation}} of teams away from their traditional districts is unusual {{because of the nature}} of the relationship between clubs and their fans: the local football club is regarded by most English football supporters as part of the local identity and social fabric rather than as a business that can be transplanted by its owners at will. As a result, any <b>relocation</b> <b>plan</b> would be strongly opposed by fans in the club's original area, and unlikely to succeed in most new locations due to the existence of established teams in most towns and cities that would already have secured the loyalty of local football fans. John Bale, summarising a study published in 1974, writes that, in the view of most fans, [...] "Chelsea would simply not be Chelsea" [...] were that club to move a few miles within the same borough to Wormwood Scrubs.|$|E

No significant relationships were found between survival status and age, gender, mobility, or dementia. Findings suggest the need for continued study of variables affecting survival status of relocated elders...|$|R
