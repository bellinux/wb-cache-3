50|$|Wounded and dishonourably {{discharged}} from the Prussian Army and threatened by financial troubles and serious bribery allegations, Major von Tellheim waits at a Berlin hotel, with his servant Paul Werner, for the outcome of his trial. His penniless condition is because <b>repayment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large sum <b>advanced</b> to the government during the recent war is being held up and his honor in making the loan questioned. During Tellheim's absence from the inn, the landlord has caused Tellheim's effects to be removed, ostensibly because his rooms were needed for a lady and her maid. In reality, the landlord doubts Tellheim's ability to pay, since he is already in arrears.|$|R
