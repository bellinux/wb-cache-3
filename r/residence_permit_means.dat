We can increase this likelihood somewhat by removing from the sample individuals originating from Poland. Out of 1422 <b>residence</b> <b>permits</b> obtained by Polish immigrants, only 47 correspond to refugees. No other country in our sample has such a low proportion of refugees as a share of all <b>residence</b> <b>permits.</b> However, recall that almost {{all the rest of the}} immigrants getting a <b>residence</b> <b>permit</b> are due to family reunion and therefore indirectly will be affected by the placement as well.|$|R
