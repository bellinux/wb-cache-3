5000|$|Rollovers {{can also}} {{occur when the}} vehicle is knocked into a {{stationary}} object such as a curb. In these so-called [...] "trip events", a vehicle hit from the side but kept from moving laterally by a curb would produce a moment about {{the center of gravity}} sufficient to produce a rollover. To counteract this, <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> systems have begun to incorporate an active suspension system in rollover protection. To accomplish this, the onboard computer uses data from the Inertial measurement unit (IMU) to determine when a vehicle is in a rollover condition independent of yaw rate and vehicle speed. When the computer determines that the vehicle is at risk of rollover, it calculates the direction of roll and activates the active suspension system. The force produced in the suspension creates a moment (torque) opposite to that created by the lateral force, and keeps the vehicle safe.|$|E

This paper presents an analysis of <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> measurement for mobile robots operating at high speeds. The analysis examines the accuracy of a commonly accepted <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> metric during operation on sloped and rough terrain. The effects of sensor placement, center-of-gravity position estimation error, and wheel dynamics are examined.

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{work performed}} to model, evaluate and verify the safety benefits of an improved {{version of the}} Roll Advisor and Controller (RA&C) on-board safety system. A U. S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Intelligent Vehicle Initiative (IVI) Field Operational Test (FOT) led by Freightliner evaluated an RA&C on-board safety system. The RA&C system assists commercial vehicle drivers, especially drivers of tanker trucks, to avoid rollover crashes. The RA&C is comprised of two components that perform two distinct functions: to inform drivers when they have performed a maneuver with {{a high risk of}} <b>rollover</b> (the roll <b>stability</b> advisor [RSA] component), and to initiate autonomous braking to prevent a <b>rollover</b> (the roll <b>stability</b> control [RSC] component). All of the data analyzed in this report came from the Freightliner IVI FOT. Data were collected on six Freightliner tractors pulling tank trailers of liquid nitrogen in revenue service during late 2000 through 2001. The methods for estimating the benefits of a safety system were developed by Battelle as part of the independent evaluation of the FOT.

40|$|A future {{limitation}} of autonomous ground vehicle {{technology is the}} inability of current algorithmic techniques to successfully predict the allowable dynamic operating ranges of unmanned ground vehicles. A further difficulty presented by real vehicles is that the pay-loads may and probably will change with unpredictably time as will the terrain on which {{it is expected to}} operate. To address this limitation, a methodology has been developed to generate real-time estimations of a vehicle’s Instantaneous Maneuvering Manifold. This approach uses force-moment method techniques to create an adaptive, parameterized ve-hicle model. A technique is developed for estimation of vehicle load state using internal sensors combined with low-magnitude maneuvers. An unscented Kalman filter based estimator is then used to estimate tire forces for use in determining the ground/tire co-efficient of friction. Probabilistic techniques are then combined with a combined-slip pneumatic trail based estimator to estimate the coefficient of friction in real-time.

40|$|For in-wheel-motor-driven {{electric}} vehicles, {{the motor}} is {{installed in the}} wheel directly. Tyre runout and uneven load can cause magnet gap deformation in the motor, which will produce electromagnetic forces that further influence the vehicle rollover characteristics.

40|$|Vehicle {{rollover}} {{represents a}} significant percentage of single-vehicle accidents and accounts for over 9000 fatalities and over 200, 000 non-fatal injuries each year. Previous research has yielded <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> control systems that are effective in on-road conditions. Accident statistics show, however, that over 90 % of rollovers involve road departure, during which a vehicle may encounter sloped and rough terrain while travelling at high speed. A critical element of most <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> control systems is a metric that monitors a vehicle’s nearness to rollover. Most metrics, however, are designed for use on flat, level surfaces characteristic of on-road terrain.

The metric is based on an estimate of the distribution of wheel–terrain contact forces. The metric can be calculated on line in real time, using only practical, low-cost sensors.

40|$|Urban {{vehicles}} {{are designed to}} deal with traffic problems, air pollution, energy consumption, and parking limitations in large cities. They are smaller and narrower than conventional vehicles, and thus more susceptible to rollover and stability issues. This thesis explores the unique dynamic behavior of narrow urban vehicles and different control actuation for vehicle stability to develop new reconfigurable and integrated control strategies for safe and reliable operations of urban vehicles. A novel reconfigurable vehicle model is introduced for the analysis and design of any urban vehicle configuration and also its stability control with any actuation arrangement. The proposed vehicle model provides modeling of four-wheeled (4 W) vehicles and three- wheeled (3 W) vehicles in Tadpole and Delta configurations in one set of equations. The vehicle model is also reconfigurable {{in the sense that}} different configurations of control actuation can be accommodated for controller design. To develop the reconfigurable vehicle model, two reconfiguration matrices are introduced; the corner and actuator reconfiguration matrices that are responsible for wheel and actuator configurations, respectively. Simulation results show that the proposed model properly matches the high-fidelity CarSim models for 3 W and 4 W vehicles. <b>Rollover</b> <b>stability</b> is particularly important for narrow urban vehicles. This thesis investigates the <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of three-wheeled vehicles including the effects of road angles and road bumps. A new rollover index (RI) is introduced, which works for various road conditions including tripped and un-tripped rollovers on flat and sloped roads. The proposed RI is expressed in terms of measurable vehicle parameters and state variables. In addition to the effects of the lateral acceleration and roll angle, the proposed RI accounts for the effects of the longitudinal acceleration and the pitch angle, as well as the effects of road angles. Lateral and vertical road inputs are also considered since they can represent the effects of curbs, soft soil, and road bumps as the main causes of tripped rollovers. Sensitivity analysis is provided to evaluate and compare the effects of different vehicle parameters and state variables on <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of 3 W vehicles. A high-fidelity CarSim model for a 3 W vehicle has been used for simulation and evaluation of the proposed RI accuracy. As a potentially useful mechanism for urban vehicles, wheel cambering is also investigated in this study to improve both lateral and <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of narrow vehicles. A suspension system with active camber has an additional degree of freedom for changing the camber angle through which vehicle handling and stability can be improved. Conventionally, camber has been known for its ability to increase lateral forces. In this thesis, the benefits of cambering for <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of narrow {{vehicles are}} also investigated and compared with a vehicle tilt mechanism. The simulation results indicate that active camber systems can improve vehicle lateral stability and rollover behavior. Furthermore, by utilizing more friction forces near the limits, the active camber system provides more improvement in maneuverability and lateral stability than the active front steering does. The proposed reconfigurable vehicle model leads us {{to the development of a}} general integrated reconfigurable control structure. The reconfigurable integrated controller can be used to meet different stability objectives of 4 W and 3 W vehicles with flexible combinations of control actuation. Employing the reconfigurable vehicle model, the proposed unified controller renders reconfigurability and can be easily adapted to Tadpole and Delta configurations of 3 W as well as 4 W vehicles without reformulating the problem. Different types and combinations of actuators can be selected for the control design including or combination of differential braking, torque vectoring, active front steering, active rear steering, and active camber system. The proposed structure provides integrated control of the main stability objectives including handling improvement, lateral stability, traction/braking control, and rollover prevention. The Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach is used to develop the reconfigurable controller. The performance of the introduced controller has been evaluated through CarSim simulations for different vehicles and control actuation configurations...|$|E

Previous automotive research has studied ways for detecting and mitigating rollover on flat ground at high speed, and robotics research has studied the <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of robots on rough terrain at low speed. Accident statistics show, however, that over 80 % of rollovers occur when a vehicle departs the roadway and encounters sloped and rough terrain at high speed. This thesis investigates the stability limits imposed by off-road terrain conditions and techniques for measuring vehicle stability in the presence of off-road terrain factors. An analysis of the effects of terrain slope, roughness, and deformability on vehicle <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> in road departure scenarios is presented. A simple model that captures the first-order effects of each of these terrain features is presented and used to compare the relative danger posed by each factor. A new stability measure is developed that is valid in off-road conditions, which include sloped, rough, and deformable terrain. The measure is based on the distribution of wheel-terrain contact forces and is measurable with practical sensors. (cont.) The measure is compared to existing stability measures and is able to detect wheel lift-off with greater accuracy in off-road conditions. The measure is experimentally validated with wheel lift-off detection as well.

40|$|The spans of precast {{prestressed}} concrete bridge girders have become longer {{to provide more}} economical and safer transportation structures. As the spans have increased, so has {{the depth of the}} girders which in turn have increased the slenderness of the girders. Slenderness in a beam or girder would increase the likelihood that a stability failure would occur. Stability failures could pose a danger to construction personnel due to the sudden nature in which a stability failure would occur. Furthermore, stability failures of {{prestressed concrete}} girders during construction would cause a detrimental economic impact due to the costs associated with the failure of the girder, the ensuing construction delays, damage to construction equipment and potential closures to highways over which the bridge was being constructed. An experimental and analytical study was performed to determine the stability behavior of prestressed concrete beams. Two stability phenomenons were investigated: (1) lateral-torsional buckling and (2) global stability. An emphasis was placed on the effects of initial imperfections on the stability behavior; the effect elastomeric bearing pads and support rotational stiffness was investigated. The experimental study involved testing six rectangular prestressed concrete beams for lateral-torsional buckling, a PCI BT- 54 for thermal deformations and the same PCI BT- 54 for global stability. The 32 -ft. long rectangular beams were 4 -in. wide and 40 -in. deep. The PCI BT- 54 had a 100 -ft. long span. A material and geometric nonlinear, incremental load analysis was performed on the six rectangular beams. The nonlinear analyses matched the experimental load versus lateral displacement and load versus rotation behavior, and the analysis predicted the experimental maximum load within an error of 2 %. The nonlinear analysis was extrapolated to several different initial imperfection conditions to parametrically study the effect of initial lateral displacement and initial rotation on the inelastic lateral-torsional buckling load. A simplified expression for lateral-torsional stability of beams with initial imperfections was developed. The data from the parametric study were used to develop reduction parameters for both initial sweep and initial rotation. The <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> behavior of the PCI BT- 54 was investigated experimentally, and it was found that support end rotations and the elastomeric bearing pads had an adverse effect on the global stability. The nonlinear analysis was employed {{with the addition of a}} bearing pad model. It was found that the behavior was sensitive to the bearing pad stiffness properties and the assumption of uniform bearing. From the research, it was apparent that <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> was the controlling stability phenomenon for precast prestressed concrete bridge girders, not lateral-torsional buckling. Ph.

Results: Nearly 98 % of the crashes were nonfatal; 63 % occurred in the U. S. and 24 % in Iraq. Among crash events where the direction of the impact was recorded, 32 % were {{to the front of the}} vehicle and 16 % involved a vehicle being rear-ended.

Although rigid body kinematics analyses of the roll-over behavior of capsules on impact provided critical insight to the Apollo problem, extensive ground test programs were also used. For the new Orion spacecraft being developed to implement today's Exploration program, new air-bag designs have improved sufficiently for NASA to consider their use to mitigate landing loads to ensure crew safety and to enable re-usability of the capsule. Simple kinematics models provide only limited understanding {{of the behavior of}} these air bag systems, and more sophisticated tools must be used. In particular, NASA and its contractors are using the LS-Dyna nonlinear simulation code for impact response predictions of the full Orion vehicle with air bags by leveraging the extensive air bag prediction work previously done by the automotive industry. However, even in today's computational environment, these analyses are still high-dimensional, time consuming, and computationally intensive. To alleviate the computational burden, this paper presents an approach that uses deterministic sampling techniques and an adaptive response surface method to not only use existing LS-Dyna solutions but also to interpolate from LS-Dyna solutions to predict the stability boundaries for a capsule on airbags.

BACKGROUND Formula SAE-A is an annual competition for university students throughout Australia and around the world, it has been recognized by industry as providing some of the best graduating engineers because of the practical and teamwork experience obtained through participation. Each year SAE produces a list of rules for the design of the vehicles, the rules that directly affect this project are: 6. 1 Suspension, 6. 2 Ground Clearance, 6. 3 Wheels, 6. 4 Tyres, 6. 5 Steering and 6. 7 <b>Rollover</b> <b>Stability.</b> All vehicles are subject to a technical inspection to ensure the rules have been adhered to. OBJECTIVES The main objectives of this project were to identify and investigate possible changes to the existing design of the steering and suspension to improve the performance and reliability from a practical and safety aspect.

40|$|The <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of high {{capacity}} transport (HCT) vehicles depends on multiple phenomena which result in lateral and vertical {{shift of the}} vehicle center of gravity and consequently in the load transfer from inner side tires to outer side tires. Vehicles' roll stability depends on the equilibrium between overturning and restoring moments. When overturning moments become governing, vehicle looses its stability and rolls over. Some of the design parameters which determine the roll stability are the height of center of gravity, track-width, suspension and tire compliance, axle and suspension roll stiffness, fifth-wheel compliance and frame exibility. United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Regulation 111 approves vehicles either by tilt table test or a calculation method, which is theoretical way to determine steady-state rollover threshold (SRT). Tilt table test is a good method but limited {{by the size of}} the test bed which makes it less preferable for long vehicle combinations with more than one articulation joints and the most preferable way to determine SRT is through a calculation method. However, calculation method involves number of non-validated parameters and simplified equations, which generally predicts higher SRT value than the actual. This overestimation can lead to rollover situation even within safe predicted zone. This study presents a plausible physical interpretation of UNECE 111 calculation method to identify its assumptions and simplifications. An alternative Roll Compliant Vehicle (RCV) method is proposed, which includes a more sophisticated approach of compliances influence on roll stability and provides a direct comparison with UNECE 111. The SRT value obtained from UNECE 111 and RCV methods are then compared with tilt table tests for certain vehicle combinations to determine the degree of UNECE 111 's SRT overestimation within the study...|$|E
40|$|Road {{vehicles}} {{tend to be}} {{more vulnerable}} to accidents especially at motorway speeds. Commercial vehicles in particular are more prone to overturning accidents due to adverse conditions like cross winds and abrupt acceleration/braking conditions. Thus, it is essential to investigate vehicle stability under various conditions of manoeuvring, cross winds and on inclined ground planes. This work presents a methodology of determining <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> of road vehicles. A wide range of destabilising factors have been investigated. These include the longitudinal and lateral inclination of the ground plane, road surface curvature; acceleration and braking effects; centrifugal cornering effects as well as the aerodynamic effects of cross winds at various wind speeds and angles of attack. These destabilising factors have been described in detail, with a description of associated variables that influence vehicle stability. A four-equation model has been proposed to evaluate the vertical ground reaction forces at each wheel, based on the force-moment system created by the above-mentioned destabilising factors. A parametric study is carried out to investigate the influence of various parameters on the overall stability of the vehicle. It is noted that higher magnitude of wind velocities cause a reduction in the maximum safe vehicle speeds. Moreover, for high magnitude of wind speeds, it is also seen that for some vehicles wind angles as low as 5 ° can cause overturning accidents, even at low vehicles speeds of 15 m/s (33. 5 mile/hour, 54 km/hour). Additionally, the influence of acceleration, braking, turning and road surface curvature has been investigated. An increase in vehicle mass is seen to be beneficial as it increases the maximum safe vehicle speeds for a given set of wind conditions, thus making the vehicle more stable. The proposed vehicle stability model can predict stability characteristics {{of a wide range of}} vehicle types...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{sloshing}} {{is known}} to strongly influence the directional dynamics and safety performance of highway tank vehicles in a highly adverse manner. Hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from liquid cargo oscillations in the tank under steering and/or braking maneuvers reduce the stability limit and controllability of the partially filled tank vehicles. While the transient fluid slosh within moving containers has been widely investigated, interactions between the sloshing cargo and the vehicle system dynamics have been addressed {{in only a few}} studies due to associated challenges. Furthermore, roll stability of heavy tank vehicles have been extensively studied in the absence of transient slosh-induced forces and moments. This dissertation research aims at exploring the fluid slosh in moving containers through analytical methods and developing efficient models for simulating interactions of fluid slosh and vehicle dynamics. A comprehensive review of relevant studies reporting tank trucks accident data, tank design standards, and analysis methods of liquid sloshing in moving containers is initially performed and briefly summarized. The literature review provides not only the essential knowledge for developing an efficient method of analysis, but also demonstrates the needs for addressing limitations in the current standards so as to include effects of liquid sloshing dynamics in road tankers. An analytical model of two-dimensional fluid slosh in horizontal cylindrical tanks subject to a lateral excitation is initially formulated assuming potential flows and linearized free-surface boundary. For this purpose, the fluid domain in the Cartesian coordinates is transformed to the bipolar coordinates, where the Laplace equation could be solved using separation of variables. The resulting hydrodynamic pressure, free-surface elevation, and slosh force and roll moment are compared with the reported experimental and numerical results to illustrate the range of applicability and limitations of the linear slosh theory. The results suggest that the linear theory can yield reasonably accurate predictions of non-resonant lateral slosh in liquid transporting vehicles with significantly less computational effort than the CFD models. A multimodal model of fluid slosh is subsequently developed to study the effect of tank cross-section on transient lateral slosh. Natural frequencies and modes of liquid slosh in tanks of different cross-sections are obtained using a variational Ritz method, which are implemented into the multimodal model. The effect of transient liquid slosh and tank cross-section on <b>rollover</b> <b>stability</b> limits of a tank vehicle is also investigated by integrating the fluid slosh model into a roll plane model of the suspended tank vehicle. The results are presented for four different tank cross-sections: circular; elliptical; modified-oval; and Reuleaux-triangle. The results show that a tank cross-section with lower overall center of mass and lower critical slosh length could yield enhanced roll stability limit under medium- and high-fill conditions. The multimodal method is also employed to investigate the effect of partial longitudinal baffles on the transient lateral slosh. Natural slosh frequencies and modes are computed using a boundary integral solution of the Laplace equation. The computational efficiency is significantly improved by reducing the generalized eigenvalue problem to a standard one involving only the velocity potentials of the elements on the half free-surface length. Damping due to the baffles is estimated from the energy dissipation rate. The results are presented for different designs/lengths of longitudinal baffles, namely, top-mounted; bottom-mounted; and center-mounted baffles. It is shown that the multimodal method yields computationally efficient solutions of liquid slosh within moving baffled containers. The results suggest that a baffle is most effective and efficient when it pierces the free-surface and partly submerged in the liquid. A three-dimensional linear slosh model is further developed to study fluid motions under simultaneously applied lateral and longitudinal excitations, characterizing braking-in-a-turn maneuver, using the multimodal method. Three-dimensional Laplace equation is initially reduced to a two-dimensional Helmholtz equation using separation of variables. A higher order boundary integral solution of the Helmholtz equation is then formulated to compute natural slosh frequencies and modes in a horizontal cylindrical tank of arbitrary cross-section. The results obtained for a circular tank suggested rapid convergence of the natural slosh frequencies and hydrodynamic coefficients. The slosh forces and moments are also computed from the nonlinear analysis of liquid slosh in a tank under various lateral/longitudinal accelerations and fill ratios using the FLUENT software. Comparisons of the results obtained from the linear and nonlinear analyses revealed that the linear slosh theory yields reasonably accurate predictions of the peak slosh forces and moments under lateral/longitudinal accelerations of steady magnitudes of up to 0. 3 g/ 0. 2 g for a tank of aspect ratio of 2. 4. ...|$|E
