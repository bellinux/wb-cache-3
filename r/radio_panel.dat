2500|$|His family {{intended}} him for {{a career}} in the law, but he was attracted to the stage. Originally an actor in non-musical plays, he was persuaded to try opera and made an immediate success. He played a range of buffo parts in operas, at Glyndebourne and internationally. [...] Wallace maintained a simultaneous career in revue, straight theatre, and broadcasting. He appeared in pantomime and at the Royal Variety Performance. As a broadcaster, he was a long-time panellist on the BBC <b>radio</b> <b>panel</b> game My Music, and he presented a television series of introductions to operas in the 1960s, as well as appearing in light entertainment shows singing a range of songs from ballads to comedy numbers.

John Amis, who appeared opposite Wallace in the series, remembered, [...] "There were many pleasurable things about being in My Music.... One was that I was actually paid every week to listen to Ian's singing: ballads, folksongs, straight songs and opera, he sang them all so that you could savour the words, and the actual sound was thrilling, a high bass-baritone with a marvellous, sonorous top F, a sound that went to the heart." [...] Occasionally Wallace would choose a rumbustious comic song, some of which he also included in his LP recordings, including [...] "The One Eyed Riley", [...] "I Can't Do My Bally Bottom Button Up", [...] "Never Do It at the Station", and the sewerman's song, [...] "Down Below".|$|E

In addition, the show received the highest AI, or Appreciation Index, figures of any comedy show on Radio 4 for 2010, and has been nominated for the 2011 Sony Radio Academy Awards. It won the category of [...] "Best <b>Radio</b> <b>Panel</b> Show" [...] in the British Comedy Guide's 2011 awards.
