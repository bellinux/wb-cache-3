25|$|In early 1984, L1164 {{failed at}} Hernes Oak and {{was struck by}} the <b>relief</b> <b>locomotive</b> and withdrawn. In 1985, L1163 was {{involved}} in a derailment near Drouin after hitting a broken rail at 70mph. The locomotive dug into the ballast and rotated through 180 degrees before rolling down an embankment. Remarkably, the crew climbed from the wreckage without serious injury and the derailed passenger carriages remained upright on the embankment, avoiding loss of life and serious injury among the passengers.|$|E
25|$|On 17 October 1997, the mid-morning {{service to}} Wellington broke down 2.5km into the Rimutaka Tunnel from the Featherston portal after an {{electrical}} fault in locomotive DC 4951's control gear. The Rimutaka Tunnel is a radio dead-spot, {{and the train}} driver and guard found the Train Control telephones on the tunnel wall to be dead. Shortly afterwards, the tunnel alarm sounded at Upper Hutt signal box indicating the train {{had been in the}} tunnel for more than 15 minutes, and a full-scale emergency response was activated. The train was removed from the tunnel two hours later by a <b>relief</b> <b>locomotive</b> from the Featherston end after a haphazard response {{on both sides of the}} tunnel. There were no injuries, although some elderly passengers required medical treatment due to the distress of the event. After the incident, changes were made to the Train Control telephones so they would self-test and track occupancy rules were modified to allow trains to coast out of the tunnel (which has a gradient of 0.25% to 0.55%) if they became disabled. Emergency services on either side of the tunnel now carry out training exercises every 2â€“3 years in preparation for such a situation.|$|E
50|$|At {{this time}} the T&BR took over the {{operation}} of its line independently, and evidently the GWR was supportive in this, lending them a <b>relief</b> <b>locomotive</b> when Queen was out of service. In January 1877 the GWR sold another small engine, Raven, to the T&BR.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{introduction}} of diesel locomotives to the Wairarapa Line in the 1950s, provision of watering services at stations along the line was reviewed in 1956. At Eketahuna, {{it was decided to}} retain the vats {{at the south end of}} the yard in case of a requirement to use a <b>relief</b> steam <b>locomotive.</b> The vat at the north end was found to be on a stand in poor condition and was removed in June 1959, with the vat being relocated to Waikokopu.|$|R
50|$|Buried {{side by side}} in {{the churchyard}} are two railwaymen, engine driver Thomas Scaife and fireman Joseph Rutherford, who both lost their lives when the boiler of their {{locomotive}} exploded in Bromsgrove station on 10 November 1840. Their gravestones both show <b>reliefs</b> of steam <b>locomotives.</b> However, the locomotive involved was an experimental one called 'Eclipse' and not one of the curious engines built for the railway by Norris of Philadelphia, an American, which is depicted on the stones.|$|R
