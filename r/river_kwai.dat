In {{what was then a}} television first for a Hollywood film, it was broadcast over five hours (including commercials) during a single evening by CBS, preempting all of that network's regular programming for that one evening. It was watched by 85.82 million people for a 37.1 average rating. It was one of the highest rated movies ever screened on television at the time (behind the broadcast premiere of Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai).</b>|$|E

5|$|As well {{as these}} and other {{television}} appearances, Morell gained several notable film roles {{towards the end of}} the 1950s. He appeared in two films which won the Academy Award for Best Picture; The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957), as Colonel Green, and Ben-Hur (1959) as Sextus. With Peter Cushing as Sherlock Holmes, he played Arthur Conan Doyle's character Doctor John H. Watson, in Hammer Film Productions' version of The Hound of the Baskervilles (also 1959). Morell was particularly keen that his portrayal of Watson should be closer to that originally depicted in Conan Doyle's stories, and away from the bumbling stereotype established by Nigel Bruce's interpretation of the role. An earlier Hammer film in which Morell appeared was The Camp on Blood Island (1957).|$|E
5|$|For {{the third}} time in as many serials the title role was played by a {{different}} actor, this time by André Morell; the part had initially been offered to Alec Clunes, but he declined it. Morell had a reputation for playing authority figures, such as Colonel Green in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957), and had previously worked with Kneale and Cartier when he appeared as O'Brien in their BBC television adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954). He had been the first actor offered the part of Quatermass, for the original serial The Quatermass Experiment in 1953; he turned the part down. Morell's portrayal of Quatermass has been described as the definitive interpretation of the character.|$|E
5|$|Mahendra {{was born}} in 1939 into a Sri Lankan Tamil family in the village Amirthakali near Batticaloa, Sri Lanka. Born to a {{professor}} father, he did his schooling at Methodist Central College and St. Michael's College, Batticaloa. As a teenager, he was drawn towards films by his class teacher. It was during this time he happened to see Bicycle Thieves (1948) and Battleship Potemkin (1925). When {{he was at the}} sixth grade, he got an opportunity to witness the making of David Lean's The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (shot in Sri Lanka) during a school field trip.

5|$|More than 30 actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, and Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar on the same day. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai.</b> Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the colorful Sheik Ilderim. The role of Jesus was played by Claude Heater (uncredited), an American opera singer performing with the Vienna State Opera in Rome when he was asked to do a screen test for the film.|$|E
5|$|When Leslie leaves Ron {{with his}} {{favorite}} movies for his surprise birthday party, {{one of them}} is The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> a 1958 film about British World War II prisoners forced to build a bridge in Thailand. The scene Ron watches on television is an actual scene from that film. The other film Leslie gives Ron is The Dirty Dozen, a 1967 war film about a team of convicted murderers being trained for mission to assassinate German officers, also during World War II. Leslie only finds out Ron's birthday, which was a closely guarded secret, by bribing an employee from Baskin-Robbins, an ice cream parlor chain that gives free scoops of ice cream to customers on their birthdays. Eagleton is such a rich town that, after their town meeting, they distribute gift bags that include an iPod Touch, a portable music player by Apple, Inc. Lindsay Carlisle Shay also drives a Cadillac Escalade, an expensive luxury sport utility vehicle brand by Cadillac. During another scene, Ron declares that birthdays were made up by Hallmark, a greeting cards company, to sell more cards.|$|E

25|$|Of his talkies, Hayakawa is {{probably}} {{best known for his}} role as Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957), for which he earned a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Hayakawa starred in over 80 feature films, and two of his films (The Cheat and The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai)</b> stand in the United States National Film Registry.|$|E
25|$|Many of Hayakawa's {{films are}} lost. However, {{most of his}} later works, {{including}} The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> the Jerry Lewis comedy The Geisha Boy in which Hayakawa lampoons his role in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> The Swiss Family Robinson, Tokyo Joe, and Three Came Home are available on DVD. For his contribution to the motion picture industry, Hayakawa was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1645 Vine Street, in Hollywood, California.|$|E
25|$|Prisoners of War {{were forced}} by their Japanese captors to labour on {{projects}} such as railway construction, later depicted in the film The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> and were frequently tortured and starved. Approximately 13,000 British soldiers and 2,000 civilians died in Japanese prisoner camps.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} {{nominated}} for Academy Awards in the categories of Best Director, Best Picture, and Best Writing of Adapted Screenplay. It lost to the movie The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> in all three categories. At the 7th Berlin International Film Festival, the film won the Golden Bear Award.|$|E
25|$|In the 1957 film The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> {{when his}} {{officers}} are ordered {{to participate in}} the construction of the bridge, British officer Col.

25|$|He {{designed}} many {{road and}} rail bridges. Husband {{was awarded the}} contract to rebuild the Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait in Wales, after a 1970 fire. The original was an 1850 rail bridge by Robert Stephenson, and Husband faced criticism for designing a double-tier bridge including an additional road deck, which he stated formed part of Stephenson's original concept. The firm also designed the bridge used in the 1957 film, The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai.</b>|$|E
25|$|Fox {{insisted on}} changes {{to reduce the}} budget to a more {{manageable}} $5.8 million. The producers hired veteran writer Michael Wilson, who had previously adapted Boulle's novel The Bridge over the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> to rewrite Serling's script. To save on special effects costs, Wilson's script described an ape society more primitive than that {{which appeared in the}} novel. The new script changed much of the plot and dialogue, but retained the Cold War themes and Serling's ending. John Chambers created the innovative makeup effects.|$|E
25|$|Sir Malcolm Henry Arnold, CBE (21 October 1921 – 23 September 2006) was an English composer. His {{output of}} works {{features}} music in many genres, including {{a cycle of}} nine symphonies, numerous concertos, concert works, chamber music, choral music and music for brass band and wind band. He wrote extensively for the theatre, with five ballets specially commissioned by the Royal Ballet, {{as well as two}} operas and a musical. He also produced scores for more than a hundred films, among these The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957), for which he won an Oscar.|$|E
25|$|After the war, Hayakawa's {{on-screen}} roles {{can best}} be described as the honorable villain, a figure exemplified by his portrayal of Colonel Saito in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957). The film won the Academy Award for Best Picture and Hayakawa earned a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor; he was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the role. After that film, Hayakawa largely retired from acting. Throughout the following years he performed guest appearances on a handful of television shows and films, making his final performance in the animated film The Daydreamer (1966).|$|E
25|$|A 1962 comedy LP with Milligan and Sellers {{as well as}} Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller. A spoof of {{the film}} The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> it was {{originally}} recorded under that name. However, the film company threatened legal action if the name was used. Thus some clever editing of the recording by future Beatles producer George Martin removed the K every time the word Kwai was uttered, creating Bridge on the River Wye. The LP is based on The Goon Shows African Incident (30/12/1957), which featured Sellers' vocal impersonation of Alec Guinness. Lewis' (1995, pp.205–206) gives a good account of this background.|$|E
25|$|The {{well-known}} red-tailed black shark (Epalzeorhynchos bicolor) {{from the}} Mae Klong river of The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> fame possibly only survives in captivity. Ironically, while pollution {{and other forms}} of overuse by humans have driven it from its native home, it is bred for the aquarium fish trade by the thousands. The Yarqon bleak (Acanthobrama telavivensis) from the Yarqon River had to be rescued into captivity from imminent extinction; new populations have apparently been established again successfully from captive stock. Balitoridae and Cobitidae, meanwhile, contain {{a very large number of}} species about which essentially nothing is known except how they look and where they were first found.|$|E
25|$|Takei entered {{architecture}} {{school at}} University of California, Berkeley, but told his parents during {{his freshman year}} {{that he wanted to}} become an actor. His parents told him they would support him if he first got a college degree, and he went on to obtain a degree in theater arts from UC Berkeley. Takei played a Japanese soldier wrongly accused of the murder of his fiancee at a production of Made in Japan at Playhouse 90. He received some acting advice from Harry Guardino during a live TV performance of the play. He went on to receive roles on Perry Mason and Return from the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> and in a civil rights play called Fly Blackbird!.|$|E
25|$|Percival was {{respected}} for {{the time}} he had spent as a Japanese prisoner of war. Serving as life president of the Far East Prisoners of War Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token £5 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause. This was distributed by the FEPOW Welfare Trust, on which Percival served as Chairman. He led protests against the film The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> when it was released in 1957, obtaining the addition of an on-screen statement that the movie was a work of fiction. He also worked as President of the Hertfordshire British Red Cross and was made an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John in 1964.|$|E
25|$|Guinness won the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in 1957 for {{his role}} in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> after having been unsuccessfully {{nominated}} for an Oscar in 1952 for his performance in The Lavender Hill Mob. He was nominated in 1958 for the Academy Award for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, for his screenplay adapted from Joyce Cary's novel The Horse's Mouth. He was nominated for Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor {{for his role}} as Obi-Wan Kenobi in Star Wars in 1977. He received an Academy Honorary Award for lifetime achievement in 1980. In 1988, he received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for Little Dorrit. He received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award for lifetime achievement in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The Viet Cong Russian {{roulette}} {{scenes were}} shot in real circumstances, with real rats and mosquitoes, {{as the three}} principals (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai.</b> The woman who was given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game. The first actor hired {{turned out to be}} incapable of slapping De Niro in the face. The caster then found a local Thai man with a particular dislike of Americans, and cast him accordingly. De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped for real by one of the guards without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.|$|E
25|$|Arnold {{began his}} career playing trumpet professionally, but {{by the age of}} 30 his life was devoted to composition. He was ranked with Benjamin Britten {{as one of the most}} sought-after composers in Britain. His natural melodic gift earned him a {{reputation}} as a composer of light music in works such as some of his concert overtures and the sets of Welsh, English, Scottish, Irish and Cornish dances. He was also a highly successful composer of film music, penning the scores to over a hundred features and documentaries, including titles such as The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> Hobson's Choice and the St Trinian's series. His nine symphonies are often deeply personal and show a more serious side to his work, which has proved more controversial. Arnold also wrote a variety of concertos and chamber works, as well as music for the theatre including major ballets.|$|E
25|$|Following this {{breakthrough}} film, {{his career}} quickly grew as Holden played {{a series of}} roles that combined good looks with cynical detachment, including a prisoner-of-war entrepreneur in Stalag 17 (1953), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor, a pressured young engineer/family man in Executive Suite (1954), an acerbic stage director in The Country Girl (1954) with Bing Crosby and Grace Kelly, a conflicted jet pilot in the Korean War film The Bridges at Toko-Ri (1954), a wandering college football star in Picnic (1955), a dashing war correspondent in Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing (1955), his most widely recognized role as an ill-fated prisoner in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957) with Alec Guinness, a World War II tug boat captain in The Key (1958), and an American Civil War military surgeon in John Ford's The Horse Soldiers (1959) opposite John Wayne. He played a number of sunnier roles in light comedy, such as the handsome architect pursuing virginal Maggie McNamara in the controversial Production Code-breaking The Moon Is Blue (1953), as Judy Holliday's tutor in Born Yesterday (1950), and as a playwright captivated by Ginger Rogers' character in Forever Female (1953).|$|E
25|$|The book is in four parts. The {{first part}} deals with Hayakawa's early career and rise to stardom (1914–15), with {{detailed}} information about the themes explored in his early films like The Wrath of the Gods (dealing with Buddhism) and The Cheat (masculinity, violence). The latter film brought him international fame. He married fellow actress Tsuru Aoki in 1914. The second and third parts discuss his films during 1916–18 and 1918–22, respectively, while the final part gives an account of his public image in both America and Japan. When Hayakawa started Haworth Picture Corporation, Japanese residents in America viewed it {{as a symbol of}} his success and entrepreneurship. However, his Americanization was viewed as a national shame in Japan. Americans, meanwhile, thought of him as a role model for Japanese settled in United States and an Americanized and refined Japanese. He left Hollywood in the late 1920s and moved to Europe, where he acted in English and French movies, before returning to Japan where he became a priest. Hayakawa's filmography is also provided in the book, with details about the characters he portrayed. The final chapter gives a detailed account of Hayakawa's role in The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> and discusses the similarities between this role and the role played by Hayakawa in The Cheat. His stage works are also discussed in this chapter.|$|E
25|$|Wyler {{typically}} {{cast the}} Romans with British actors and the Jews with American actors to help underscore {{the divide between}} the two groups. The Romans were the aristocrats in the film, and Wyler believed that American audiences would interpret British accents as patrician. Marie Ney was originally cast as Miriam, but was fired {{after two days of}} work because she could not cry on cue. Heston says that {{he was the one who}} suggested that Wyler cast Martha Scott (who had played the mother of Heston's Moses in The Ten Commandments, and with whom he'd worked on Broadway) as Miriam. Scott was hired on July 17, 1958. Cathy O'Donnell was Wyler's sister-in-law, and although her career was in decline (Ben-Hur would be her last screen performance) Wyler cast her as Tirzah. More than 30 actresses were considered for the role of Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, primarily because he had become famous for his roles as a wise old patriarch in a number of films. Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar the same day as Jaffe. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai.</b> Wyler's efforts at persuasion were successful, and Hawkins was cast on March 18, 1958. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the comical Sheik Ilderim. Finlay Currie had worked with Zimbalist before on Quo Vadis, playing St. Peter, was cast as Balthasar.|$|E
500|$|André Morell (born Cecil André Mesritz, 20 August 1909 [...] 28 November 1978) was an English actor.

His best known screen roles were as Professor Bernard Quatermass in the BBC Television serial Quatermass and the Pit (195859), and as Doctor Watson in the Hammer Film Productions version of The Hound of the Baskervilles (1959). He also appeared in the films The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957) and Ben-Hur (1959), in several of Hammer's horror films throughout the 1960s and in the acclaimed ITV historical drama The Caesars (1968).|$|E
500|$|Balanathan Benjamin Mahendran (20 May 1939 [...] 13 February 2014), {{commonly}} known as Balu Mahendra, was an Indian cinematographer, director, screenwriter and film editor who worked predominantly in Tamil cinema. Born into a Sri Lankan Tamil household, he developed a passion for photography and literature at a young age. After witnessing the shoot of David Lean's The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> (1957) during a school trip in Sri Lanka, he was drawn towards filmmaking. He graduated from the London University and started {{his career as a}} draughtsman with the Sri Lankan Government. In 1966, he moved to India and gained admission to the Film and Television Institute of India (FTII) to pursue a course in motion picture photography. Upon completion of his diploma, he entered Malayalam cinema as a cinematographer in the early 1970s.|$|E
500|$|According to Andrew Pulver of The Guardian, {{the public}} fascination with war films became an [...] "obsession", with over 200 war films {{produced}} in each {{decade of the}} 1950s and 1960s. War film production in the United Kingdom and United States reached its zenith in the mid 1950s. [...] Its popularity in the United Kingdom was {{brought on by the}} critical and commercial success of [...] Charles Frend's The Cruel Sea (1953). Like others of the period, The Cruel Sea was based on a bestselling novel, in this case the former naval commander Nicholas Monsarrat's story of the battle of the Atlantic. Others, like The Dam Busters (1954), with its exciting tale of the inventor Barnes Wallis's unorthodox bouncing bomb and its distinctive theme music, were true stories. The Dam Busters became the most popular film in Britain in 1955, and remained a favourite as of 2015 with a 100% score on Rotten Tomatoes, though, partly because it celebrated an [...] "exclusively British [...] ", it failed to break into the American market. A large number of war films were made in the 1955-58 period in particular. In 1957 alone, Bitter Victory, Count Five and Die, The Enemy Below, Ill Met by Moonlight, Men in War, The One That Got Away and Seven Thunders, and the highly successful, critically acclaimed pictures The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai,</b> which won the Academy Award for Best Picture that year, and Paths of Glory were released. Some, such as Bitter Victory, focused more on the psychological battle between officers and egotism rather than events during the war. The Bridge on the <b>River</b> <b>Kwai</b> brought a new complexity to the war picture, with a sense of moral uncertainty surrounding war. By {{the end of the decade}} the [...] " [...] sense of shared achievement" [...] which had been common in war films [...] "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.|$|E
