A B-tree T on S is parameterized by two integer values: a leaf parameter b ≥ B and a branching parameter p ≥ 16. We assume that both b and p are multiples of 16. Given a node u of T, we denote by sub(u) the subtree of u. All the leaves of T are at the same level, namely, the length of each root-to-leaf path is the same. Each leaf node, if it is not the root, contains between b/ 4 and b elements in S—referred to as leaf elements. Each element of S is stored in one, and exactly one, leaf. Consider now an internal node v with child nodes u 1, u 2, [...] ., uf. We refer to the value of f as the fanout of v.

40|$|The address {{plan for}} IPv 4 has a {{reservation}} for “Private Use ” address space. This reservation, comprising three distinct address blocks, namely 10. 0. 0. 0 / 8, 172. 16. 0. 0 / 12 and 192. 168. 0. 0 / 16, {{is intended for}} use in private contexts where networked devices {{do not have any}} requirement to be visible to the public Internet. However, it has long been recognised that other addresses have also been used in private contexts. Some of these uses are entirely informal and remain entirely within a particular private network, while other uses have been a little more systematic. One recent study of this form of address use noted that the address block of network 1, or 1. 0. 0. 0 / 8, was “widely used as private address space in large organizations whose needs exceed those provided for by RFC 1918 ” [1].

While network 1. 0. 0. 0 / 8 was an unallocated and (officially at least) unadvertised network any traffic directed to an address in this network that “leaked ” into the public Internet would follow a “default ” routing path to the point where there was a “default-free ” <b>routing</b> <b>element,</b> where the traffic would be discarded.
