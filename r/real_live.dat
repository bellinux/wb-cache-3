He also {{appeared}} on Dylan's live album <b>Real</b> <b>Live,</b> {{as well as}} the follow-up studio album Empire Burlesque. In 1984, Dylan asked Mick Taylor to assemble an experienced rock and roll band for a European tour he signed with Bill Graham. Ian McLagan was hired to play piano and Hammond organ, Greg Sutton to play bass and Colin Allen, a long-time friend of Taylor, on drums. The tour lasted for four weeks at venues such as Munich's Olympic Stadium Arena and Milan's San Siro Stadium, sharing the bill with Carlos Santana and Joan Baez, who appeared on the same bill for a couple of shows.|$|E
500|$|Banksy {{extended}} his work beyond the canvas and city street with other political statements, including on 16 October, when he crafted a giant fiberglass sculpture of Ronald McDonald, with a <b>real</b> <b>live</b> Banksy assistant shining its shoes.

The work criticized the [...] "heavy labor required to sustain the polished image of a mega-corporation", as the narrator of the audio accompaniment put it.|$|E
500|$|At {{the very}} end of its history, the {{economics}} of the Restoration spectacular spiralled out of control with the magnificent production of The Fairy Queen in the 1691–92 season.

As Downes recalls: [...] "Though the court and town were wonderfully satisfied with it ... the expenses in setting it out being so great, the company got little by it." [...] Its twelve-foot-high working fountain and six dancing <b>real</b> <b>live</b> monkeys have become notorious in theatre history.|$|E

500|$|Each night {{following}} the shows, the musicians and Dowd would [...] "grab some beers and sandwiches" [...] {{and head to}} Manhattan's Atlantic Studios {{to go over the}} performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. [...] "We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't {{want to go back and}} overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a <b>real</b> <b>live</b> album," [...] said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. [...] "That was our pinnacle," [...] said Dickey Betts later. [...] "The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have.

500|$|In 1993, Bruce Dickinson {{left the}} band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a {{farewell}} tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package).

The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, however, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows and that at several concerts he would only mumble into the microphone. Dickinson denies the charge that he was under-performing, stating {{that it was impossible}} to [...] "make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour. He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the BBC and released on video under the name Raising Hell.|$|E
500|$|Power was {{recorded}} in Los Angeles at DJ Evil E's home, which was known as Syndicate Studios West. Ice-T described how Syndicate Studios West was set up with a board connected to speakers to resemble a car stereo system so they could test how tapes would sound. A closet in the home was converted into a booth to record the vocals. Afrika Islam noted that recording at his home meant the group had no time constraints while recording the album. Ice-T stated that recording {{it did not take}} a long time saying: [...] "The recording was fast" [...] and that he recorded every record he's made in [...] "a matter of a month, maybe two at the most". Power was mixed at Entourage Studios in Los Angeles by Mark Wolfson. Some tracks feature guest vocalists, such as Donald D and Hen-Gee on [...] "The Syndicate". Donald D was a DJing partner of Afrika Islam in the 1970s while Hen-Gee is DJ Evil-E's brother. The vocals on [...] "I'm Your Pusher" [...] are credited to Pimpin' Rex, who Ice-T mentioned was [...] "one of my buddies, a <b>real</b> <b>live</b> pimp".|$|E

500|$|When it {{came time}} for a video for [...] "Jurassic Park", Yankovic opted to use stop-motion and claymation; he joked during a Q that this was because [...] "it's just too hard to find <b>real</b> <b>live</b> dinosaurs these days." [...] "Jurassic Park" [...] was Yankovic's first video that was entirely animated—previous videos, such as [...] "Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies" [...] and [...] "Dare to Be Stupid" [...] had {{featured}} elements of animation. The video was directed by Mark Osborne and Scott Nordlund. Yankovic initially heard of the duo from Bill Manspeaker, the lead singer of the comedy rock band Green Jellÿ. After being hired for the project, the two [...] "basically turned a private residence in Los Angeles into a clay animation studio." [...] The two worked between July and August 1993, and slept in shifts, so that the final project would be ready for its release in October 1993. One critic noted that the music video seems to have been done in the style of Will Vinton's Dinosaurs! – A Fun-Filled Trip Back in Time! The video parodies scenes from, as well as the general plot of the 1993 movie, and contains a myriad of sight-gags—as is usual for Yankovic's videos—such as a claymation version of Steven Spielberg running from dinosaurs, Barney having his head ripped off, and a Velociraptor attempting to break down a door, only to realize it has a key.|$|E
500|$|Belle has {{garnered}} widespread acclaim from film critics, {{several of}} whom voiced their {{preference for the}} character over her predecessor, Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Hal Hinson of The Washington Post described Belle as a [...] "compelling" [...] character who is [...] "more mature, more womanly and less blandly asexual" [...] than Ariel, as well as [...] "a more worldly girl", describing her as [...] "a bookworm, with gumption and a mind of her own." [...] Similarly comparing Belle to Ariel, John Hartl of The Seattle Times wrote that, in Beauty and the Beast, [...] "there's rarely a sense of deja vu, perhaps because the heroine is so different from 'Mermaid's' dependent Ariel, and her dilemma is more poignant," [...] while Boxoffice scribed, [...] "Undoubtedly in response to criticism that the cute little 'Mermaid' Ariel {{was nothing more than}} a precocious sexpot, the idea-people behind this beauty—aptly named Belle ... chose to make her an icon of self-reliance and a voracious reader with a curiosity and love for everything around her." [...] Jennie Punter of The Globe and Mail extolled Belle as a [...] "smart, courageous ... 'take-charge kind of gal'," [...] while crowning her the [...] "main attraction of Beauty and the Beast." [...] Emma Cochrane of Empire hailed Belle as [...] "a feminist heroine who [...] more rounded than previous Disney characters", while Paste's Annlee Ellingson similarly enjoyed the character's [...] "feminist kick." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Baltimore Sun wrote that [...] "Belle ... is no passive fairy tale princess, but a <b>real</b> <b>live</b> girl, with a spunky personality and her own private agenda." [...] TV Guide wrote that [...] "The familiar narrative is strengthened by the independent, self-assured character of Belle," [...] concluding, [...] "Unlike Disney heroines from Snow White through Ariel, Belle is smart, knows what she wants, and doesn't spend her time pining away for the love of a handsome prince." [...] Marc Bernardin of Entertainment Weekly praised Belle's heroism, dubbing her [...] "the hero" [...] of Beauty and the Beast, while Entertainment Weekly's Christian Blauvelt opined, [...] "Unlike previous Disney heroines who needed to be rescued by a prince themselves, Belle not only saves the Beast's life, she saves his soul." [...] TLC's Vicki Arkoff received Belle as a [...] "smart" [...] and [...] "sharp-tongued" [...] heroine, crediting the character for [...] "break Disney's passive-princess mold." [...] About.com's David Nusair described Belle as an [...] "admirable" [...] heroine. AllMovie's Don Kaye and Perry Seibert echoed each other's reviews of the character, with Kaye describing both Belle and the Beast as [...] "three-dimensional ... complex individuals who defy stereotyping and change over the course of the story," [...] and Seibert calling Belle a [...] "strong female character" [...] who [...] "sidesteps most of the clichés surrounding Disney heroines." [...] Common Sense Media hailed Belle as [...] "one of Disney's smartest, most independent heroines." ...|$|E
