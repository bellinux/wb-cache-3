40|$|Self-healing {{concrete}} is concrete {{that can}} fill cracks of approx. 0. 2 mm width {{that have occurred}} after hardening by precipitating a compound. When applying that concrete to railway structures after completion of development, we can expect the concrete {{to be able to}} prevent leaks beneath elevated structures. It could also allow omission of waterproofing underground because groundwater can be kept out with this concrete alone. Consequently, construction and maintenance costs can be reduced, and we can provide amenity-rich service spaces and build reliable structures (Fig. 1). Taking into account application of that self-healing concrete to actual structures, we have checked durability and properties of fresh concrete such as liquidity at casting.

40|$|The Session Management Protocol (SMP) is an {{important}} part of a session layer for mobile, disconnection- and delay-tolerant communication devel-oped at Ericsson Research. This layer lets applications use sessions instead of sockets to communicate with network endpoints. Such sessions are very persistent, surviving even network outages and changes in network attach-ment. SMP may run on top of TCP/IP or other network protocols, and handles data integrity and resumption after disconnection and suspension for sessions. It also deals with sending and processing messages related to the communication context. In this thesis, we formally describe SMP, specify its correctness, and ver-ify several protocol models in the validation language Promela by using the model checker Spin. As a preparation for verication, the protocol is char-acterized informally in a structured manner. After outlining the modelling and verication approach, we give <b>reports</b> <b>on</b> model <b>checking.</b> In particular, we highlight the detection of an error in data integrity management, and describe how this discovery led to changes in the protocol. By applying abstraction and separating the concerns of safety and live-ness, protocol model complexity was reduced to permit exhaustive veri-cation in Spin.

Data Sources: A systematic review of the relevant electronic databases was conducted including PubMed and Web of Science. The main search terms included ‘‘hockey, ice hockey, injury, body checking, child, adolescent, and pediatric. ’’ Study Selection: The initial search identified 898 potential articles, and, after verifying inclusion criteria, 260 articles were selected for further assessment. The Downs and Black instrument for non-randomized studies (Downs 1998) was used to assess the quality of the articles. Data Extraction: Studies included <b>reported</b> <b>on</b> body <b>checking</b> as a mechanism of injury and compared injury rates in checking to non-checking leagues in children 20 years or younger. Data Synthesis: Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria and they predominantly found increased injuries associated with body checking. The relative risk of injury associated with body checking in comparative studies ranged from 0. 6 to 39. 8. Checking was the reported mechanism of injury between 2. 9 % and 91 % of injuries. All but 1 study that met our inclusion criteria found an increased risk of injuries when body checking was permitted. Conclusions: Increased injuries attributable to checking were found where checking was allowed. This study supports policies that disallow body checking to reduce injuries in young children...|$|R

Lafranchise did not file {{a report of the}} visit until January 9, 2008, on the day that the girls' bodies were discovered. (At the time the visit was made, such reports were not required; a rule requiring <b>reports</b> when <b>checking</b> <b>on</b> the welfare of a resident was instituted {{in the wake of the}} Jacks case.) In the initial report, Lafranchise said that he had seen only the three younger girls on his visit; he filed a follow-up <b>report</b> <b>on</b> January 13 that said he [...] "thought" [...] he had seen Brittany as well. He reported during the homicide investigation that the girls, including Brittany, appeared [...] "clean and well fed, healthy and playful." [...] When questioned at Jacks' trial, Lafranchise said that he had not seen Brittany at the house; he said that he had not been told to look for a teenager and assumed he was there to <b>check</b> <b>on</b> the three younger girls, even though he spoke with Lopes on his cell phone while he was at the Jacks home. The D.C. police department said that they would be conducting an internal investigation of Lafranchise and the inconsistent reports.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} the physics results, derived from the {{analysis}} of the data collected at the Pierre Auger Observatory depends heavily on the calibration and monitoring of the components of the detectors. It is crucial to maintain a database containing complete information on the absolute calibration of all photomultipliers and their time evolution. The low rate of the physics events implies that the analysis will have to be made {{over a long period of}} operation. This requirement imposes a very organized and reliable data storage and data management strategy, in order to guarantee correct data preservation and high data quality. The Fluorescence Detector (FD) consists of 27 telescopes with about 12, 000 phototubes which have to be calibrated periodically. A special absolute calibration system is used. It is based on a calibrated light source with a diffusive screen, uniformly illuminating photomultipliers of the camera. This absolute calibration is performed every few years, as its use is not compatible with the operation of the detector. To monitor the stability and the time behavior, another light source system operates every night of data taking. This relative calibration procedure yields more than 2 × 10 [sup] 4 raw files each year, about 1 TByte/year. In this paper we describe a new web-interfaced database architecture to manage, store, produce and analyse FD calibration data. It contains the configuration and operating parameters of the detectors at each instant and other relevant functional parameters that are needed for the analysis or to monitor possible instabilities, used for the early discovery of malfunctioning components. Based on over 10 years of operation, we present results on the long term performance of FD and its dependence on environmental variables. We also <b>report</b> <b>on</b> a <b>check</b> of the absolute calibration values by analysing the signals left by stars traversing the FD field of view...|$|R

This is devoted to integration with the Italian National Seismic Network (RSN) [Delladio 2011] in the epicentral area, thus improving the localization of the aftershocks distribution after a mainshock. This infrastructure is composed of a stand-alone, locally recording part (Re. Mo.) [Moretti et al. 2010] and a real-time telemetered part (Re. Mo. Tel.) [Abruzzese et al. 2011 a, 2011 b] that can stream data to the acquisition centers in Rome and Grottaminarda. After the May 20, 2012, Ml 5. 9 earthquake in the Emilia region (northern Italy), the temporary network was deployed in the epicentral area; in particular, 10 telemetered and 12 stand-alone stations were installed [Moretti et al. 2012, this volume]. Using the dedicated connection between the acquisition center in Rome and the Ancona acquisition sub-center [Cattaneo et al. 2011], the signals of the real-time telemetered stations were acquired also in this sub-center.
