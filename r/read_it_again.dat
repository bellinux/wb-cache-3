25|$|In a magician's {{house on}} another island, Lucy {{attempts}} {{to perform a}} spell {{that would make her}} tragically beautiful, despite being warned of negative consequences. Just as she is about to say the words, however, she sees an image of Aslan snarling at her, frightening her from reading the spell (in the 2010 film, she reads the spell and turns into a version of Susan and finds her brothers have not heard of Lucy or Narnia). Aslan also reprimands her for using another spell to see what her friends say about her. She encounters a story-spell that she feels is the best story ever that disappears after she reads it, and Aslan reassures her that she will be able to <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
500|$|Don Novello as Vincenzo [...] "Vinny" [...] Santorini, an Italian demolitions expert. Kirk Wise and Russ Edmonds, Vinny's supervising animator, noted Novello's unique {{ability to}} improvise dialogue. Edmonds recalled, [...] " [...] {{would look at}} the sheet, and he would read the line that was written once, and he would never <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again!</b> And we never used a written line, it was improvs, the whole movie." ...|$|E
500|$|After dinner a {{book would}} be read aloud, {{and he would}} take notes in a cursory way. [...] I {{remember}} {{that one of his}} friends, when the reader pronounced a word wrongly, checked him and made him <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> and my uncle said to him, [...] "Did you not catch the meaning?" [...] When his friend said [...] "yes," [...] he remarked, [...] "Why then did you make him turn back? [...] We have lost more than ten lines through your interruption." [...] So jealous was he of every moment lost.|$|E
60|$|She {{had read}} this letter once, and now while sipping her second {{cup of coffee}} was <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{when the door opened}} and Tom Starbrow walked into the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{the best}} thing I had ever written. Insight into life ran through every line, I found myself <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with delight. Suddenly a voice beside me said:-- ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have been}} very much struck by the book you sent me. It {{is one of the}} wisest, the manliest, and most {{serviceable}} I ever read. I am <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with the greatest pleasure and admiration.|$|R
500|$|... "Gone for Goode" [...] {{marks the}} first {{performance}} of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has played in more than 300 television episodes {{in a number of}} shows, including Homicide and [...] Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer to take some time to reread and practice the material, then come back and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] included guest appearances by actors who later become much more widely known. Steve Harris, who later achieved fame playing Eugene Young on the ABC legal drama The Practice, played an uncooperative suspect who repeatedly lies to Munch during questioning. Alexander Chaplin, who later played speechwriter James Hobert on the ABC sitcom Spin City, portrayed the alleged murderer Johnny in [...] "Gone for Goode". The comedic confession scenes involving Jim Grollman as accused murderer Jerry Jempson were almost entirely improvised.|$|E
500|$|The first Homicide season {{featured}} the first performances of Richard Belzer as Detective John Munch, a character the actor has been credited for in 459 television episodes (...) in nine different television series, including Homicide and [...] Levinson asked Belzer {{to audition for}} the part after hearing the comedian ranting on The Howard Stern Show, where Belzer was a frequent guest. Levinson said Belzer was a [...] "lousy actor" [...] during his first audition with the [...] "Gone for Goode" [...] script. Levinson asked Belzer {{to take some time}} to reread and practice the material, then come back and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> During his second reading, Levinson said Belzer was [...] "still terrible", but that the actor eventually found confidence in his performance. Daniel Baldwin was cast as Beau Felton, and dyed his naturally blond hair black for the role. Baldwin {{became one of the most}} vocal supporters of the show, giving many press interviews about it and defending it amid declining ratings. Baldwin declared, [...] "Homicide is the best material I've had the chance to do." [...] Melissa Leo was cast as Kay Howard, which was considered a particularly strong part compared to other female characters in police dramas at the time, which were usually limited to love interests or minor parts. While most cast members shadowed real-life Baltimore detectives to prepare for the roles, Leo did not because, she said, [...] "I don't like to look at the horror that's in the world." [...] Wendy Hughes was cast as medical examiner Carol Blythe.|$|E
2500|$|Gottlieb {{wrote him}} an {{encouraging}} letter, {{in which he}} stated again that he felt Toole was very talented (even more so than himself) and that if Toole were to re-submit the manuscript {{he would continue to}} [...] "read, reread, edit, perhaps publish, generally cope, until you are fed up with me. What more can I say?" [...] In early 1966, Toole wrote Gottlieb one final letter, which has never been located. Gottlieb wrote him back on January 17, 1966, concluding their correspondence with a letter where he re-iterated his feelings on the book and stated that he wanted to <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> when Toole created another revision.|$|E
6000|$|... "It proves {{nothing of}} the kind," [...] said the general, {{recurring}} to the note. After <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> he looked keenly at her: [...] "Am I to understand that you have given him the right to suppose {{you would want to}} know the worst--or the best of him?" ...|$|R
2500|$|... “I am <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> {{with fresh}} {{interest}} and admiration. Nor is it otherwise than pleasant {{to me to}} find in your story some trail of what I must suppose is old inveterate Manxness. [...] your book floats forth to certain success, a magnificent craft, fit for deep waters and the large horizon. Good luck to her!” ...|$|R
6000|$|But after <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> once through, she did {{not wait}} for him before <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> and again. She did this with bewilderment, intershot with flashes of conviction, and then doubts of this conviction. When she could {{misunderstand}} no longer, she rose quietly and folded the letter, and put it carefully back into its envelope and into her writing desk, where she sat down and wrote, in her clearest and firmest hand, this note to Mavering-- ...|$|R
2500|$|Milward Kennedy in {{his review}} in The Guardian of 21 September 1934 said after {{summarising}} the set-up of the plot that, [...] "Poirot has no part in this book; instead, {{a young man and}} a young woman who blend charm and irresponsibility with shrewdness and good luck contrive amusingly and successfully to usurp the functions of the police. The fault which I find is the overimportance of luck. For the villains it was, for example, singular good luck which enabled them to discover and identify an obscure vicar's fourth son asleep on a solitary picnic; it was very bad luck for them {{that he was able to}} assimilate a sixteenth times fatal dose of morphia. They were lucky, again, in having always at hand just the properties required to make an extempore murder seem something else; and as for the Bright Young Couple – but these are defects which are little noticeable in the gay stream of Mrs. Christie's narrative. Perhaps I should not have noticed them had I not read the book so quickly that, in a secluded village, there was nothing for it next day but to <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with a sterner eye but no less enjoyment." ...|$|E
60|$|I have <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{and it does}} really seem a {{good deal}} more mixed than ever.|$|E
60|$|Benjulia's {{letter was}} among the other letters waiting on the table. She took it up, and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|At last, {{after she}} had ceased to expect it, came a letter from his mother, not a brief note, but a letter which the invalid had evidently tasked herself to make long and full, in {{recognition}} of Alice's kindness in writing to her so much. The girl opened it, and, after a verifying glance at the signature, began to <b>read</b> <b>it</b> with a thrill of tender triumph, and the fond prevision of the greater pleasure of <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with Dan.|$|R
50|$|Producing an {{audiobook}} {{consists of}} a narrator sitting in a recording booth reading the text, while a studio engineer and a director record and direct the performance. If a mistake is made the recording is stopped and the narrator <b>reads</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> With recent advancements in recording technology, many audiobooks are also now recorded in home studios by narrators working independently. Audiobooks produced by major publishing houses undergo a proofing and editing process after narration is recorded.|$|R
5000|$|Lumet cast Treat Williams after {{spending}} three weeks {{talking to him}} {{and listening to the}} actor read the script and then <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> with 50 other cast members. In order to research the role, the actor spent a month learning about police work, hung out at 23rd Precinct in New York City, went on a drug bust and lived with Leuci for some time. By the time rehearsals started, Williams said, [...] "I was thinking like a cop." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Forwarded from Beaupark," [...] Winterfield said to himself. He {{opened the}} letter--read it {{carefully}} to the end--thought over it--and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{drew the}} {{telegram}} {{from his pocket}} again furtively, almost guiltily, and re-read it. He turned it over and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again....</b>|$|E

5000|$|Robert Sapolsky said that, [...] "Chaos is {{the first}} book since Baby Beluga, where I've gotten to the last page and {{immediately}} started <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> over <b>again</b> from the front." ...|$|R
60|$|He <b>read</b> <b>it</b> through <b>again,</b> and, like a judge, {{began to}} weigh {{what she had}} written, her {{thoughts}} when she was writing, the facts which had led up to this.|$|R
6000|$|He {{put on his}} spectacles, {{glanced at}} the paper, and gave a sudden start, <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{carefully}} this time, and then said slowly: ...|$|E
60|$|Helena read it, <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> {{folded it}} up {{and put it in}} her purse. Her mother stood {{watching}} her, consumed with distress and anxiety.|$|E

60|$|He {{thrust his}} hand in his pocket, while the {{railroad}} attorney remained impassive, and drew out the draft of the bill. Mr. Gorse <b>read</b> <b>it,</b> then <b>read</b> <b>it</b> over <b>again,</b> and laid <b>it</b> {{down in front of}} him.|$|R
60|$|Newman {{uttered a}} {{significant}} grunt, and taking Mr Mantalini's proffered card, limped with {{it into his}} master's office. As he thrust his head in at the door, he saw that Ralph had resumed the thoughtful posture into which he had fallen after perusing his nephew's letter, and {{that he seemed to}} have been <b>reading</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> as he once more held it open in his hand. The glance was but momentary, for Ralph, being disturbed, turned to demand the cause of the interruption.|$|R
60|$|He pondered {{over that}} result {{until he had}} {{thoroughly}} realized it and fixed it in his mind. Then he took out Mrs. Glenarm's letter, and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> through <b>again,</b> attentively, from beginning to end.|$|R
60|$|Sanford {{tore the}} {{envelope}} open, read the telegram rapidly, the smile fading {{out of his}} face. He <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> word for word, then sat looking at it.|$|E
60|$|She {{went to the}} chimneypiece, {{on which}} had been left the {{telegram}} that summoned her to the Gare du Nord, and <b>read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again.</b> She gave a little cry of surprise.|$|E
6000|$|... "Superb!" [...] said Madame, in a {{voice of}} enthusiasm; [...] "how true! what passion! what energy! what sentiments! what {{knowledge}} of feminine feeling! <b>Read</b> <b>it</b> <b>again,</b> I pray: it is my favourite passage." ...|$|E
40|$|The A. {{picks up}} the topic wich matters to the historiography of {{diplomatics}} {{in the last two}} centuries. She <b>reads</b> <b>it</b> <b>again</b> {{from the point of view}} of the XI-XII centuries records of Piacenza; they are good examples to reconstruct the events that drove to the achievement of the  imbreviaturae case. Notaries in Piacenza were susceptible to the need of giving and warranting  fides to the record and they drafted alternatives solutions: each of them is sign of a different phase of the process of definition of the notary’s public role in the medieval legal system...|$|R
60|$|One {{morning he}} {{received}} in the mail the long-expected note from the bishop, making an appointment for the next day. Hodder, as he <b>read</b> <b>it</b> over <b>again,</b> smiled to himself... He could gather nothing of {{the mind of the}} writer from the contents.|$|R
