40|$|AbstractThe {{analysis}} of signals of surges and <b>rotating</b> <b>stalls</b> occurring and processing {{is essential to}} reveal the characteristics of instability phenomena, to develop detecting methodology and active control technique, to assure the rig and compressor safety. A high-speed 7 -stage compressor was tested on a rig, with 10 channels of casing static pressures and a channel of outlet total pressure. It illustrates by {{the case with the}} rotating speed 16, 400 RPM. Firstly, to detect the stall precursors, the spectrum analysis and the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) are employed. It shows the precursors are formed about 3. 5 s before the surge point in each stage individually. Then, the correlation functions are calculated to analysis the relationship between casing static pressures. Results show that the <b>rotating</b> <b>stalls</b> of the 1 - 3 stages have phase differences, while the 4 - 7 stages do not. Finally, the time-domain waveforms analysis instruct that the stagnation cell of surge is firstly formed between the 3 rdand the 4 thstator rows, and then moves downwards. The surge is companied with the <b>rotating</b> <b>stalls.</b> The front 3 stages are in the cycles of the stall-surge-recover-stall in the whole surge process...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rotating</b> <b>stall</b> {{is a local}} {{disruption}} of airflow within the compressor which continues to provide compressed air but with reduced effectiveness. <b>Rotating</b> <b>stall</b> arises when {{a small proportion of}} airfoils experience airfoil stall disrupting the local airflow without destabilising the compressor. The stalled airfoils create pockets of relatively stagnant air (referred to as stall cells) which, rather than moving in the flow direction, rotate around the circumference of the compressor. The stall cells rotate with the rotor blades but at 50 to 70% of their speed, affecting subsequent airfoils around the rotor as each encounters the stall cell. Propagation of the instability around the flow path annulus is driven by stall cell blockage causing an incidence spike on the adjacent blade. The adjacent blade stalls {{as a result of the}} incidence spike, thus causing stall cell [...] "rotation" [...] around the rotor. Stable local stalls can also occur which are axi-symmetric, covering the complete circumference of the compressor disc but only a portion of its radial plane, with the remainder of the face of the compressor continuing to pass normal flow.|$|E

However, motors often break catastrophically when driven backward, so backward rotation is not equivalent to forward rotation. Also, cells can <b>rotate</b> backward while <b>stalled,</b> either in randomly timed jumps of 180 degrees or very slowly and smoothly.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Large wind turbine blades, manufactured from fibre reinforced laminated composite materials, are key structural components of wind turbine systems. The demands for efficient and accurate modelling techniques of these composite blades have significantly increased. Over past decades, although complex computational models have been widely developed, more analytically based models are still very much desired to drive the design and optimization of these composite blades forward to be lighter, stronger, efficient and durable. The research work in this thesis aims to develop such more analytically based aerodynamic, structural and aero-elasticity models for large wind turbine blades manufactured from fibre reinforced laminated composite materials. Firstly, an improved blade element momentum (BEM) model has been developed by collectively integrating the individual corrections with the classic BEM model. Compared to other existing models, present BEM model accounts for blade tip and root losses more accurately. For laminar flow, the 3 -D cross-flow is negligibly small. In this case, present BEM model with statically measured 2 -D aerodynamic coefficients agrees closely to experimental measurements. However, stall delay correction is required for a 3 -D <b>rotating</b> blade in <b>stall.</b> A new stall delay model is developed based on Snel s stall delay model. Verifications are performed and discussed for the extensively studied NREL UAE phase-VI test. The predictions of distributive and collective factors, e. g. normalised force coefficients, shaft torque and etc. have been compared to experimental measurements. The present BEM model and stall delay model are original and more accurate than existing models. Secondly, significant deficiency is discovered in the analytical thin-walled closed-section composite beam (TWCSCB) model proposed by Librescu and Vo, which is widely used by others for structural modelling of wind turbine blades. To correct such deficiency, an improved TWCSCB model is developed in a novel manner that is applicable to both single-cell and multi-cell closed sections made of arbitrary composite laminates. The present TWCSCB model has been validated {{for a variety of}} geometries and arbitrary laminate layups. The numerical verifications are also performed on a realistic wind turbine blade (NPS- 100) for structural analysis. Consistently accurate correlations are found between present TWCSCB model and the ABAQUS finite element (FE) shell model. Finally, the static aero-elasticity model is developed by combining the developed BEM model and TWCSCB model. The interactions are accounted through an iterative process. The numerical applications are carried out on NPS- 100 wind turbine. The numerical results show some significant corrections by modelling wind turbine blades with elastic coupling...|$|R
