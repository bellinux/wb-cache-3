40|$|This paper explores {{groupwork}} within <b>rehabilitative</b> palliative <b>care</b> {{on three}} distressing cancer symptoms: pain, dyspnoea and fatigue. This was achieved through qualitative methodology using a phenomenological orientated psychological approach in a cohort {{with a median}} age of 66 years. Groupwork, which included: social, exercise and divertional therapy groups were seen as important components within <b>rehabilitative</b> palliative <b>care.</b> Through semi-structured interviews the participants’ perceptions of their symptoms, beliefs and attitudes towards their groupwork within <b>rehabilitative</b> palliative <b>care</b> were explored. The relevance and benefits of the groupwork were then identified using quality of life markers established during data analysis. The main factors uncovered and shown {{to contribute to the}} groupwork were: environmental factors, mobilisation and normalisation. However more research is required to comprehend how different forms of groupwork can help reduce pain, dyspnoea and fatigue in older people with cancer. ...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} in-service education for nursing personnel in simple <b>rehabilitative</b> nursing <b>care</b> on the activity level of patients in nursing homes. A structured observation and an interview was used in order (1) to observe the present activity level of the total population in a selected nursing home, and (2) to reevaluate the activity level of the same patients after the nursing personnel caring for them had been exposed to in-service education in simple <b>rehabilitative</b> nursing <b>care.</b> Because some change may occur in the activity level of patients without any change in nursing care, the patients of another nursing home were observed on two occasions as a control group. It was hoped that this study would provide information that could be used as a basis for in-service education programs for nursing personnel in nursing homes. This study was designed to identify the effects of in-service education for nursing personnel in simple <b>rehabilitative</b> nursing <b>care</b> on the activity level of patients in nursing homes. The findings revealed that the patients who were recipients of simple <b>rehabilitative</b> nursing <b>care</b> made greater gain toward independence in activity than the patients in the control group- even though the gain was small...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE. We {{determine}} the extent to which noninstitutionalized long-term care patients receive assistance from family members and friends, and evaluate the effect of this assistance on use of outpatient <b>rehabilitative</b> and personal <b>care</b> services. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SETTING. Over 12 months, primary data were collected from 289 patients in noninstitutional settings after inpatient rehabilitation at three Boston-area rehabilitation hospitals. Data on patients' acute and rehabilitative stays were obtained from medical record reviews. Patients provided primary data on sociodemographics, living arrangements, social supports, functional status, health behaviors, life events, and use of outpatient services during the study period. The latter was verified and service charge data obtained from the care providers. STUDY DESIGN. The study was longitudinal and observational. Patient-provided information was obtained at one, six, and twelve months postdischarge. ANALYTIC METHODS. Multivariate Tobit regression was used to evaluate the effect of social supports on patients' use of <b>rehabilitative</b> and personal <b>care</b> services, controlling for sociodemographics and functional status. Service use was measured as charges incurred during the 12 -month study period. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. Results confirm the primary role of family and friends in providing daily personal care and identify the availability of that support as a key determinant of expenditures on community-based personal care services. Social supports do not predict outpatient rehabilitative service use. CONCLUSIONS. Differing eligibility criteria seem appropriate for outpatient <b>rehabilitative</b> and personal <b>care</b> services. The current emphasis on functional status in determining rehabilitative service eligibility appears appropriate; but we find that considering patients' social supports would be both meaningful and appropriate in determining personal care service eligibility. This approach would avert the expense of making personal care services universally available, while facilitating assistance for patients whose functional and social status put them at increased risk of institutional placement...|$|R
