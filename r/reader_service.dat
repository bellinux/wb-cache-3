40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} screenwriting and higher {{education}} in terms of emergent, digital ‘ecologies of screenwriting expertise’. Established forms of screenwriting guidance and instruction, such as ‘how-to’ guides {{and higher education}} academic-practitioners, now sit alongside new, digital and networked sites for screenwriting education such as Lynda. com and The Blacklist 3. 0. Examining Lynda. com, the online learning platform, and The Blacklist, a fee-based professional script <b>reader</b> <b>service,</b> we argue for the {{need to address the}} teaching of screenwriting both inside and outside higher education. Bound into ‘ecologies of screenwriting expertise’ are complex and overlapping questions concerning how professional boundaries are policed, about who has or claims to have industry access, and about how and where efforts are made to ensure that aspiring writers are supported with relevant insights and advice. Across our examples, we argue that expert biographies and profiles are created and operationalised with varying levels of visibility which correspond with authority and legitimacy, especially from the perspective of those aspirants and amateurs who are paying to use these sites and spaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{isolation}} of many veterinary practitioners from {{easy access to}} medical information is a concern to both veterinary and library professions. Despite the prevalence of personal computers in veterinary practice management, {{there is little evidence}} to demonstrate that veterinarians are taking advantage of the computerâ s telecommunication capabilities to search remote databases. The survey findings of Pelzer et al indicate that veterinarians continue to rely on personally owned books and journals as their major information resource and make limited, if any, use of online databases. A number of reasons offered by Langston and Waldhalm to explain this limited use include expense of the online services, lack of detailed abstracts/full text online, and the perceived difficulty of obtaining articles not available in the practitionersâ personal library. Pelzerâ s study also indicates that very few veterinarians take advantage of the computerâ s power to maintain personal indexes for the journals or reference files they do own. Langston and Waldhalm view the time required for data entry to constitute a hindrance to most veterinarians in creating a filtered bibliographic system based on their own libraries. Three of the five journals identified by White as being key veterinary information resources have recently initiated a <b>reader</b> <b>service</b> which will enable practitioners to easily build and abstracted index to the articles in those journals. The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Compendium of Continuing Education for the Veterinary Practitioner, and Journal of the American Animal Hospital Association now carry datastrips containing authorsâ names, titles, abstracts, citations, and key words when available, of the articles contained in each issue. This paper explains how the strips were developed, how they can be scanned, decompressed and imported into most commercial database applications. Examples will be provided for end-user manipulation of the coded information to retrieve articles through a variety of access points using both Macintosh and MS-DOS applications. A description is also given of a service provided by the Mississippi State University College of Veterinary Medicine Library to make the datastrip information available in decompressed files to faculty and students through a local computer network and to alumni via diskettes by mail.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the demographic factors and personality {{of a group of}} qualified Tasmanian librarians. Ninety five librarians employed at the academic, public, school and special institutions were tested during May to July, 1973. The tests administered were the 16 PF-Form A, the EPI-Form A, and an information sheet. The findings: (1) Half the female librarians are relatively young; the majority of librarians live in Hobart and the surrounding suburbs, especially the southern Hobart area; the majority are of Australian and British nationality; over half the librarians are married; the female librarians tend to receive lower salaries; most librarians possess B. A degrees; a third of librarians in all institutions have obtained their qualifications since 1970; {{and there has been a}} considerable growth of librarianship in Tasmania. (2) Generally, librarians are of above average intelligence, experimenting, critical, self-sufficient, resourceful, resolute persons. They tend to be neither unduly attentive to nor conventional in practical matters but to be a sensitive, effeminate, aesthetically inclined group. They tend to be aloof and reserved persons, who prefer working alone rather than dealing with people. As a group, librarians tend also to be casual and less dependable. (3) Although both <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> and technical services librarians exhibit the above average qualities, <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> librarians tend to be less attentive to or conventional in practical matters but possessing more self-confidence. (4) Technical services staff, especially older technical services librarians, female technical services librarians and female cataloguers, are more silent, serious and uncommunicative than <b>reader</b> <b>services</b> staff.
