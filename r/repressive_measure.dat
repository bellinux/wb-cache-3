50|$|Once {{publishers}} {{learned of}} the provisions, the <b>repressive</b> <b>measure</b> encountered strong opposition. All the native associations irrespective of religion, caste and creed denounced the measure and kept their protests alive. All the prominent leaders of Bengal and India condemned the Act as unwarranted and unjustified, and demanded its immediate withdrawal. The newspapers themselves kept criticizing the measure without end. The succeeding administration of Lord Ripon reviewed the developments consequent upon the Act and finally withdrew it. However, the resentment it produced among Indians helped fuel India’s growing independence movement. The Indian Association, which is {{generally considered to be}} one of the precursors of the Indian National Congress, was one of the Act's biggest critics. The crucial demand for a judicial trial in case of an accusation of sedition against an editor was never conceded by the government, although in October I878 the act was modified in minor respect; the submission of proofs before publication was no longer insisted upon, although the bail-bond remained.|$|E

5000|$|The curfew bell {{with the}} {{associated}} curfew law is recorded by history as having been started by Alfred the Great. The law associated with the curfew bell is a custom that history records as being adopted by William I of England in the year 1068. The curfew law imposed upon the people was a compulsory duty {{they had to do}} or be punished like a criminal. Historians, poets, and lawyers speak of the Medieval law associated with the curfew bell as being levelled mostly against the conquered Anglo-Saxons. It was initially used as a <b>repressive</b> <b>measure</b> by William I to prevent rebellious meetings of the conquered English. He prohibited the use of live fires after the curfew bell was rung to prevent associations and conspiracies. The strict practice of this medieval tradition was pretty much observed during the reign of King William I and William II of England. [...] The law was eventually repealed by Henry I of England in 1103.|$|E
5000|$|England {{suffered}} {{economic hardship}} {{in the years}} immediately following the Napoleonic Wars, and Lord Liverpool's government faced growing demands for social, political and economic reform. In the textile towns of the industrial north, wages fell sharply as the factory system developed, and traditional handloom weavers were among the worst affected.The Corn Laws of 1815 onward were intended to protect British agricultural landowners from cheap foreign imports, but their effect was to increase grain prices and decrease supplies, causing hardship among the poor. In 1816 (the [...] "Year without a summer") severe weather resulted in poor harvests, leading to further food shortages during the winter of 1816 - 1817. Discontent led to riots, first in some country districts and then in towns and cities, notably the London Spa Fields riots of November-December 1816. A Reform Bill for universal suffrage was drafted, with considerable input from the Northern radicals, and presented to Parliament at the end of January by Thomas Cochrane, but it was rejected on procedural grounds by the House of Commons. [...] After the Prince Regent's coach was attacked on the way back from Parliament on 28 January 1817, the government embarked on the so-called [...] "Gag Acts", a number of measures to repress the radicals, including the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act. The rejection of the draft bill, and the increasingly <b>repressive</b> <b>measure,</b> led to a series of events that included the Blanketeers' march, as the radicals attempted, as Poole puts it: [...] "to appeal in the last resort to the crown over the head of parliament, and to exercise in person the right of petitioning which had been denied them by proxy".In January and February 1817, various workers' and deputies' meetings in Manchester were addressed by the radical orators Samuel Drummond and John Bagguley. A recurring theme of these meetings was the supposed legal right of individuals to address petitions directly to the Crown. Drummond and Bagguley helped plan a march to London to present such a petition, holding meetings along the way and encouraging others to join the demonstration, and these plans were announced by William Benbow at a public meeting in Manchester on 3 March, at which the hope was expressed that the marchers would be 20,000 strong.|$|E

Preventive measure is related to the setting of corruption eradication so that people do not corrupt.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis thesis presents {{an analysis of}} factors contributing to the disparity in treatment of the Palestinian refugees in the Levant. Each case study presents a basic overview of the historical background for the Palestinian refugee migration to the state before highlighting seven factors affecting the Palestinians. The factors of legal framework, economics, politics, space within the state, relationship of the PLO, Islamists, and Palestinians, and identity are evaluated to determine their relevance for the state's treatment of the Palestinians in the Levant. Two factors emerged as the main influencers for treatment of the Palestinians. The research shows that each nation's economic situations drove the level of integration into the state. The research shows that Jordan needs the Palestinians refugees' economic provision to support their rentier economy. Syria has absorbed the Palestinians into their economy, but {{was not willing to}} afford the refugees the same rights as their citizens. Lebanon does not seek to disrupt its confessional balance through integration of the Palestinians economically. Economics also affects the second factor, the politics surrounding the Palestinians. All three cases demonstrated a willingness integrate the Palestinians only to a level that would maintain political power for the ruling party. Lebanon again uses confessional politics to justify its lack of integration. The Syrian Alawi elite seeks to maintain their political monopoly pacifying the Palestinians enough to prevent action. Jordan's authoritarian regime also seeks to maintain its political power. They seek to minimize Palestinian political action through <b>repressive</b> <b>measure</b> that ensure the authoritarian regime's survival. While all the factors bore some relevance to the treatment of the Palestinians, economics and politics emerged as the principal factors affecting the treatment of the Palestinians in the Levant...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa pretende-se um estudo preliminar sobre o período de liberação da censura prévia no jornal alternativo Movimento de maio até julho de 1978. A partir da análise do conteúdo das matérias sobre política no semanário, mais especificamente as matérias relacionadas às críticas ao regime e aos direitos humanos (tópicos bastante censurados), pretendo ver qual era o tipo de resistência presente nas suas páginas – quatro edições antes do final da censura e quatro edições após a queda da medida repressiva. Para o estudo, utilizarei os conceitos de Michel de Certeau, tática e estratégia. Enquanto a tática é chamada por De Certeau, de “a arte do fraco” e necessita aproveitar as brechas deixadas pelo outro, a estratégia possui um espaço próprio e pode ter um planejamento para acontecer. Além disso, pretendo ver o contexto do semanário, a forma na qual os conteúdos desses dois períodos se relacionavam e quais eram os grupos que ocupavam suas páginas, espaço que possuía vozes diversas.

Based on the analysis of the content of stories focused on politics in the weekly paper, specifically on the stories related to criticism of the regime and to human rights (broadly censured topics), I aim at verifying what was the type of resistance present in this newspaper – four issues prior to the ending of censorship and four issues released {{after the fall of the}} <b>repressive</b> <b>measure.</b> To this end, the concepts coined by Michel de Certeau, tactics and strategy will be used in this study. While the tactics is defined by De Certeau as “the art of the weak” and needs to take advantage on the gaps left by the other, strategy has its own space, and may have its own planning in order to happen. Furthermore, the aim here is to see the context of this weekly paper, the way in which the contents on these two periods of time were related and what were the groups that occupied its pages, a space which held different voices...|$|E
