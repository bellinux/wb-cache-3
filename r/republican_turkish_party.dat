On 12 March 2009 Kıbrıs Media Group was suddenly presented with a tax demand in the amount of 11 million Turkish Lira ($6.3 million) payable the following day, on pain of the sequestration of its assets.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the proliferation {{and development of}} the Turkish clubbing scene in the cities of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. It points to how a new clubbing scene is created within the existing mainstream nightlife in order to overcome social and cultural constraints in accessibility and to meet the cultural preferences of the Dutch-Turkish consumers. Nowadays these <b>Turkish</b> <b>parties</b> are being incorporated in established and popular dance halls in the city centres. The question will be addressed as to whether <b>Turkish</b> <b>party</b> organisations and party-goers are engaged in politics of recognition by claiming their space in mainstream nightlife. Furthermore, the paper addresses how <b>Turkish</b> <b>parties</b> can offer a space for the expression of a collective cultural identity by analysing why and how Dutch-Turkish young people opt for the Turkish clubbing scene. The research findings discussed in this paper are taken from in-depth interviews with consumers and producers of <b>Turkish</b> <b>parties</b> in Amsterdam and Rotterdam, from Internet discussions, and from participant observation during several <b>Turkish</b> dance <b>parties...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{results of}} the {{election}} {{were considered to be}} a major upset of power by the mainstream Turkish Cypriot media.

Siber's failure to progress to the second round led to shock and controversy in her party and Prime Minister Özkan Yorgancıoğlu announced that he would be stepping down in the upcoming party congress. Özersay's share of the votes was seen as a major surprise success. Eroğlu announced his withdrawal from political life following the election.|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the first round were {{described}} as a [...] "surprise" [...] upset of power by the mainstream newspaper Kıbrıs. The candidates that emerged [...] "joyful" [...] from the first round were, according to the newspaper, Akıncı and Özersay. Özersay's high share of votes was especially pointed out as a surprise, given his lack of political history. It was commented that the discontented supporters of the National Unity Party (UBP) and Democratic Party (DP) had supported Özersay. The ruling <b>Republican</b> <b>Turkish</b> <b>Party</b> (CTP) was reported to be [...] "in shock" [...] over the failure of their candidate to progress to the second round. The newspaper reported claims that Siber had been the victim of an internal struggle within the party, and that many CTP voters had supported Akıncı. As Eroğlu's votes had seen a great decline from 2010, the results reportedly caused great turmoil and controversy within the UBP and the DP, as well as the CTP, which are the largest parties represented in the parliament. On 26 April, while voting, Prime Minister Yorgancıoğlu announced that the CTP congress to determine the leader of the party, scheduled to take place in October or November, could be rescheduled a few months earlier, and {{that he would not be}} a candidate in the congress.|$|E

After the election, Gülay Yedekci, a member of the parliament from the CHP, put forward the proposal for the law on 6 July. The proposal would remove the provision for the reduction of sentences for the perpetrators of violence and murder against women upon the grounds of [...] "good behavior" [...] and [...] "unjust provocation" [...] from Article 102 of the Turkish Penal Code. The proposal would also increase the penalty for child marriage and remove the provisions about the [...] "consent" [...] of the child. Such proposals had already been put forward in the parliament for three years, but, according to CHP MP Aylin Nazlıaka, were passed over whilst laws that [...] "appeared to increase the freedom of women, but actually condemning them more and more to their houses" [...] were approved. The proposed changes were postponed again as an early general election was scheduled for 1 November. The postponement of the [...] "Özgecan Law" [...] prompted further protests, which were supported by MPs from the CHP.|$|E
