Investigations are being done on the biodistribution of radio-labelled SWNTs in mice by in vivo positron emission tomography (PET), ex vivo biodistribution and Raman spectroscopy. It was found that SWNTs that are functionalized with phospholipids bearing polyethylene glycol (PEG) are surprisingly stable in vivo. The effect of PEG chain length on the biodistribution and circulation of the SWNTs was studied. Effectively PEGylated SWNTs exhibited relatively long blood circulation times and low uptake by the reticuloendothelial system (RES). Efficient targeting of integrin positive tumor in mice was achieved with SWNTs coated with PEG chains linked to an arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (<b>RGD)</b> <b>peptide.</b> A high tumor accumulation was attributed to the multivalent effect of the SWNTs. The Raman signatures of SWNTs were used to directly probe the presence of nanotubes in mice tissues and confirm the radio-label-based results.|$|E

Here we report an example of 18 F-labeled tetrameric <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> for PET of avb 3 expression in both xeno-graft and spontaneous tumor models. Methods: The tetra-meric <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> EfE[c(RGDyK) ] 2 g 2 was derived with amino- 3, 6, 9 -trioxaundecanoic acid (mini-PEG; PEG is poly(ethylene glycol)) linker through the glutamate a-amino group.

The receptor-binding characteristics of the tetrameric RGD pep-tide tracer 18 F-FPRGD 4 were evaluated in vitro by a cell-binding assay and in vivo by quantitative microPET imaging studies. Results: The decay-corrected radiochemical yield for 18 F-FPRGD 4 was about 15 %, with a total reaction time of 180 min starting from 18 F-F 2. The PEGylation had minimal effect on integ-rin-binding affinity of the <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide.</b> 18 F-FPRGD 4 has signifi-cantly higher tumor uptake compared with monomeric and dimeric <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> tracer analogs. The receptor specificity of 18 F-FPRGD 4 in vivo was confirmed by effective blocking of the uptake in both tumors and normal organs or tissues with excess c(RGDyK).

Blocking studies with cyclo[RGDfV] inhibited the in vivo uptake of Cyp-GRD, suggesting that both compounds target the same active site of the protein. A strong correlation between the Cyp-GRD peptide and mitochondrial NADH concentration suggests that the new molecule could also report on the metabolic status of cells ex vivo. Interestingly, neither a Cypate-labeled linear <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> nor an 111 In-labeled DOTA-GRD conjugate was selectively retained in the tumor. These results clearly demonstrate the synergistic effects of Cypate and GRD peptide for molecular recognition of integrin expression and suggest the potential of using carbocyanines as optical scaffolds for designing biologically active molecules...|$|E

30|$|Formation of <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> {{thin film}} on the Au surface is {{relatively}} simple and can be performed using self-assembly method as discusses in the earlier [3, 4]. But, their defined nanoscale pattern on Au surface requires a relatively complex modified self-assembly method [10, 11].

40|$|A new {{biomimetic}} nanointerface {{was constructed}} by facile grafting the bioactive arginylglycylaspartic acid (<b>RGD)</b> <b>peptide</b> on the graphene oxide (GO) surface through carbodiimide and N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling amidation reaction. The formed RGD-GO nanocomposites own unique two-dimensional structure and desirable electrochemical performance. The linked RGD peptides could improve GO’s biocompatibility {{and support the}} adhesion and proliferation of human periodontal ligament fibroblasts (HPLFs) on RGD-GO biofilm surface. Furthermore the biologically active RGD-GO nanocomposites were demonstrated as a potential biomimetic nanointerface for monitoring cell biobehaviors by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). By {{analysis of the data}} obtained from equivalent circuit-fitting impedance spectroscopy, the information related to cell membrane capacitance, cell-cell gap resistance, and cell-electrode interface gap resistance in the process of cell adhesion and proliferation could be obtained. Besides, this proposed impedance-based cell sensor could be used to assess the inhibition effect of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on the HPLFs proliferation. Findings from this work suggested that <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> functionalized GO nanomaterials may be not only applied in dental tissue engineering but also used as a sensor interface for electrochemical detection and analysis of cell behaviors in vitro...|$|E
30|$|PS-PEG-COOH {{micelles}} {{were prepared}} with the above-described interfacial instability procedure, with PS-PEG-COOH molecules being {{used instead of}} PS-PEG ones. Conjugation with Tat peptide or <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> was then conducted via the EDC/sulfo-NHS method. To activate the carboxyl groups of micelles, 0.3  ml of 0.1  M MES buffer solution containing 2  mg/ml EDC and 5  mg/ml sulfo-NHS {{was added to the}} micelle dispersion (3  ml) and reacted without stirring for 30  min at room temperature. The extra EDC and sulfo-NHS were then removed by using a 30 -kD ultrafiltration tube (centrifugation at 10  krpm for 5  min), and the obtained dispersion was re-suspended in PBS (1  ml). Subsequently, 50  μl of Tat peptide (2  mg/ml in PBS) or 50  μl of <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> (0.5  mg/ml in PBS) was added and reacted for 12  h at 4  °C, respectively. The obtained peptide-conjugated PS-PEG micellar QD dispersion was purified by using a 50 -kD ultrafiltration tube (centrifugation at 10 krpm for 5  min) for three times to remove the extra peptide molecules and re-suspended in PBS (1  ml).|$|E
40|$|Viral {{nanoparticles}} have {{uniform and}} well-defined nano-structures {{and can be}} produced in large quantities. Several plant viral nanoparticles have been tested in biomedical applications {{due to the lack}} of mammalian cell infectivity. We are particularly interested in using Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), which has been demonstrated to enhance bone tissue regeneration, as a tuneable nanoscale building block for biomaterials development. Unmodified TMV particles have been shown to accelerate osteogenic differentiation of adult stem cells by synergistically upregulating BMP 2 and IBSP expression with dexamethasone. However, the lack of affinity to mammalian cell surface resulted in low initial cell adhesion. In this study, to increase cell binding capacity of TMV based material the chemical functionalization of TMV with arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (<b>RGD)</b> <b>peptide</b> was explored. An azide-derivatized <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> was clicked to tyrosine residues on TMV outer surface via an efficient copper(I) catalysed azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. The ligand spacing is calculated to be 2 - 4 nm, which could offer a polyvalent ligand clustering effect for enhanced cell receptor signalling, further promoting the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{integrin}} αvβ 3 {{plays an}} important role in angio-genesis. It is expressed on tumoral endothelial cells as well as on some tumor cells. RGD peptides are well-known to bind preferentially to the αvβ 3 integrin. In this context, targeting tumor cells or tumor vasculature by RGD-based strategies is a promising approach for delivering anticancer drugs or contrast agents for cancer therapy and diagnosis. RGD-based strategies include antagonist drugs (peptidic or peptidomi-metic) of the RGD sequence, RGD-conjugates, and the grafting of the <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> or peptidomimetic, as targeting ligand, at the surface of nanocarriers. Although all strategies are overviewed, this review aims to particularly highlight the position of RGD-based nanoparticles in cancer therapy and imaging. This review is divided into three parts: the first one describes the context of angiogenesis, the role of the integrin αvβ 3, and the binding of the <b>RGD</b> <b>peptide</b> to this integrin; the second one focuses on RGD-based strategies in cancer therapy; while the third one focuses on RGD-based strategies in cancer diagnosis...|$|E
