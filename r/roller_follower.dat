50|$|The unusual {{combustion}} chamber arrangement with its angled valves {{also led to}} an unusual valve train. The block-mounted camshaft operates small wedge shaped rockers, one for each valve. In early models the camshaft acts on a simple pad on the rocker, but for later models this pad {{was replaced by a}} <b>roller</b> <b>follower.</b> The exhaust rockers act directly on the valves, whilst the inlet rockers act on pushrods running up to a second set of longer flat rockers operating the inlet valves. The Rover engine, like many 1940s and earlier British designs, was a small bore, long stroke (undersquare) engine to keep the RAC tax horsepower rating as low as possible, thus keeping the road tax as low as possible. The IOE layout enabled Rover to use larger valves than would normally be possible in a small bore engine, allowing better breathing and better performance.|$|E
5000|$|Certain cams can be {{characterized}} by their displacement diagrams, which reflect the changing position a <b>roller</b> <b>follower</b> (a shaft with a rotating wheel at the end) would make as the cam rotates about an axis. These diagrams relate angular position, usually in degrees, to the radial displacement experienced at that position. Displacement diagrams are traditionally presented as graphs with non-negative values. A simple displacement diagram illustrates the follower motion at a constant velocity rise followed by a similar return with a dwell in between as depicted in figure 2. The rise is {{the motion of the}} follower away from the cam center, dwell is the motion where the follower is at rest, and return is the motion of the follower toward the cam center.However, the most common type is in the valve actuators in internal combustion engines. Here, the cam profile is commonly symmetric and at rotational speeds generally met with, very high acceleration forces develop. Ideally, a convex curve between the onset and maximum position of lift reduces acceleration, but this requires impractically large shaft diameters relative to lift. Thus, in practice, the points at which lift begins and ends mean that a tangent to the base circle appears on the profile. This is continuous with a tangent to the tip circle. In designing the cam, the lift and the dwell angle [...] are given. If the profile is treated as a large base circle and a small tip circle, joined by a common tangent, giving lift [...] , the relationship can be calculated, given the angle [...] between one tangent and the axis of symmetry ( [...] being [...] ), while [...] is the distance between the centres of the circles (required), and [...] is the radius of the base (given) and [...] that of the tip circle (required) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} an analytical method for analysing the mechanical errors of disc cam mechanisms. With {{the aid of}} parametric expressions of the cam profile and by employing the concept of equivalent linkage, the error of the follower motion that {{is due to the}} variation in each design parameter can be determined analytically. The resulting error equations do not really involve the location of the curvature centre of the cam profile, and thus locating the curvature centre of the cam profile is not essential. The method is validated through analysing a cam mechanism that has an invariant equivalent linkage, and thus an exact solution is avail-able. Compared with the exact solutions, the predicted results have at least four-figure accuracy. For the <b>roller</b> <b>follower</b> cases, the pressure angle has most effect on the resulting error. Owing to the counteraction of the shift angle, the resulting error due to the radial dimension error of the cam profile has relatively smaller variation. In the worst case, owing to the combined effects of various design parameters, the accuracy of the follower motion may degrade considerably. The acceleration error functions have a sudden change at the ends of the motion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Instead of 2 D {{expanding}} diagram method, {{this paper}} presents a new regenerating method for cutter location paths of using smaller tools to produce cylindrical cams. According to the expected motions, cams are put to use in various applications in mechanism. For a cylindrical cam, the <b>roller</b> <b>follower</b> operates in a groove cut {{on the periphery of}} an end mill with the diameter same as the roller. By using the conventional method, full-sized cutting tools, will restrict the flexibility of choosing cutting tools for wide roller guide. The manufacture of cylindrical cams is complicate and precise work that depends on the generating method and types of machine tools employed. Since the guiding curve cannot be offset exactly along the cylindrical surface, this leads to some approximating problems. Though the tool-paths generation by using the same size tools as rollers is applied in practice, the study of NC program by unequal tools is not available to meet high precision requirement. This proposed 3 D offset-based generating method can regenerate tool-paths for standard cutting tools instead of larger ones and implemented on computerized CAM system. Examples with wider grooves are demonstrated to prove its effectiveness...|$|E
