In supercooled. clouds, ice formed only on the forward edges of small protuberances and wires and presented no serious hazard to operation. Ice accretions of the glaze type which occurred in conditions described as freezing drizzle adversely affected various components to a somewhat greater extent. The results indicated, a need for protection of certain components such as antennas, propellers, and certain parts of the control system. The tests showed that icing of the large surface of the envelope occurred only in freezing rain or drizzle. Because of the infrequent occurrence of these conditions, the potential maximum severity could not be estimated from the test results. The increases in heaviness caused by icing in freezing rain and drizzle were substantial, but well within the operational capabilities of the airship. In order to estimate the potential operational significance of icing in freezing rain, theoretical calculations were used to estimate: (1) the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>icing</b> as a function of temperature and rainfall intensity, (2) the climatological probability of occurrence of various combinations of these variables, and (3) the significance of the warming influence of the ocean in alleviating freezing-rain conditions.

40|$|The {{natural gas}} hydrate attracts much concern from the {{countries}} {{all over the}} world as one of potential energy with large amounts of storage, however, the present researches are focused on hydrate in the sea, not involving the hydrate frozen soil hydrate. Through the researches lasting many years, experts on the frozen soil in our country predicts that the frozen soil area in the Qiangtang basin in Qinghai-Tibet Plain possesses the temperature and the pressure condition for the formation of natural gas hydrate, possibly contains large amount of natural gas hydrate resoures. In order to study the formation and the evolution rule for natural gas hydrate in frozen soil and to appraise the resource quantity of natural gas hydrate in the Qinghai-Tibet Plain, the hyrate formation kinetics in the frozen soil is need to be investigated. The frozen soil is the mixed system, contains the porous medium and the ice. In order to simplify the research process and the analysis, the single porous media such as the quartz sand is generally used to study on the formation process of natural gas hydrate in this work. In this thesis, a new equipment for the methane hydrate formation in high pressure was built, and the preliminary experimental investigation on the formation of methane hydrate in the mixture <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> powders and quartz sand was carried. The influence of the temperature, the pressure, the surface area ratio <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> powders to quartz sand on the formation of methane hydrate and the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> were investigated by the constant pressure and precooling method. The results shows that: (1) There is no induction period of nucleation in the formation of methane hydrate in a mixed system <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> powders and sand,moreover the hydrate sample with good dispersion is obtained; (2) The hydration velocity <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> powders increases exponentially with increasing pressure in the middle period of reaction, the influence of pressure on the velocity <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> powders reaction and the final hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> is small in the earlier and later period of reaction, the final hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> reaches about 60 %; (3) The lasting reaction time increases with increasing the temperature. The reaction lasts about 100 minutes at 263 K, about 150 minutes at 269 K, and about 250 minutes at 273 K. The hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> increases with increasing the temperature, the value is 42 % at 263 K, 51 % at 269 K, and 60 % at 273 K; (4) The hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> increases with increasing the surface area ratio <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> powders to quartz sand Ks in the initial period of reaction,however, Ks has no influence on the lasting time of the initial period of reaction, the lasting time is about 30 minutes. In the middle period of reaction, the lasting time ncreases with increasing Ks,however, the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> increases formerly and dereases later. In the later period of reaction, Ks has nearly no influence on the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice.</b> However, the final hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> increases with increasing the surface area ratio <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> powders to quartz sand Ks. When the Ks is 0. 00, the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> is only 32 %; When the Ks is 0. 33, the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> is 38 %; When the Ks is 0. 66, the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> is 44 %; When the Ks is 1. 32, the hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> can reach 51 %; (5) The existence of quartz sand can enhance the velocity <b>of</b> the <b>ice</b> powders reaction, but reduce the final hydration <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> ice;(6) The formation mechanism of methane hydrate in a mixed system <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> powders and sand was discussed.

40|$|A ship {{travelling}} in sub-freezing {{conditions may}} encounter sea spray, rain, fog or snow freezing onto {{various parts of}} it. Such ship icing is a well-known threat for those individuals who have served on ships operating in a cold marine climate. As de-icing techniques may be energy consuming, accurate prediction of icing is also desirable from a financial point of view. Throughout the last 60 years {{there have been several}} efforts trying to model this elusive phenomenon. However, the lack of accurate field observations poses questions to the accuracy of the state-of-the-art modelling approaches including the parameterization of the physical processes of the models. As a consequence, the current study presents and utilises icing data obtained from ship observations in Arctic-Norwegian waters supplemented with high-resolution reanalysis data. On the basis of a unique data set derived from observations recorded on a particular ship type of the Norwegian Coast Guard, a completely new icing model has been developed. Verification of this Marine Icing model for the Norwegian COast Guard (MINCOG) and comparison to currently-applied methods in operational weather forecasting, reveals higher accuracy of MINCOG compared to the other methods. Furthermore, the study stresses the importance of including wave information separately into marine-icing models rather than incorporating it in the wind-speed parameter. A major finding of the study is that nature dictates an upper limit to the degree of icing that may arise from wave-ship interactions, since high waves and very low air temperatures rarely coexist. It is also highlighted that the inclusion of snow may be important for ship icing to transpire, and that icing ensues most frequently during cold-air outbreaks from the ice. In addition, when a more general approach is applied to the icing problem, a prediction method utilising the temperature at 850 hPa provides a potential for forecasting icing several days or weeks ahead in time. The prediction models presented in this study may be incorporated in an ensemble prediction system (EPS) providing the officer of a ship an early warning about the risk of icing and the probability of an expected growth <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>icing...</b>|$|E

From the water efflux rate and water potential difference, {{the resistance of the}} barrier controlling movement of intracellular water to sites <b>of</b> extracellular <b>ice</b> was calculated. Comparison of the resistance of this barrier to water movement with the resistance of the cell membrane revealed that the membrane represented only 0. 5 % of the barrier resistance.

40|$|Local <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> {{sea level}} rise (SLR) depend on both global and local factors. The {{expected}} range of global sea level rise by 2100 is 7 - 23 inches (IPCC 2007). Locally, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns and vertical land movements {{will affect the}} amount of relative sea level rise. Based on our understanding of these factors to date, sea level rise in the Puget Sound region is expected to closely match the changes in global sea level. Very little relative SLR is expected in the northwest Olympic peninsula due to <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> tectonic uplift that exceed projected <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> SLR. Due to limitations in available data, we cannot characterize the uplift characteristics of the central and southern coasts; however, the few data points available suggest that uplift in this region is lower than that observed to the north. Uncertainties in both the climate system and in human response to climate change will make exact predictions difficult. The future climate will depend upon the future <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> greenhouse gas emissions, which is subject to policy initiatives and economic incentives. Future sea level rise also depends on uncertain <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> sheet melting in Greenland and Antarctica. Recently observed higher <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> sheet melting make 48 inches of sea level rise by 2100 {{within the range of}} possibility. It is well established that physical impacts of climate change and sea level rise will manifes...|$|R
40|$|The freeze {{substitution}} histological technique {{allows the}} indirect light microscopicobservation and the quantitative evaluation <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> crystal size in frozen tissues. Theuseofchemical fixatives in substitu ting fluids improves morphological and histochemical {{preservation of the}} tissue. Fixation conditions become important since this step can introduce modifications in crystal sizes. Effects of temperature on: a) diffusion <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> fixing solution in tissue, b) recrystallization <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>ice</b> in frozen beef and c) variations of the froze~ water fraction were ana lyzed, establishing that 1 sothermal freeze fixation constitutes an appropriate method for histological observation.
