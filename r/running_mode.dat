40|$|The OLYMPUS {{experiment}} {{measured the}} cross-section ratio of positron-proton elastic scattering relative to electron-proton elastic scattering {{to look for}} evidence of hard two-photon exchange. To make this measurement, the experiment alternated between electron beam and positron beam <b>running</b> <b>modes,</b> with the relative integrated luminosities of the two <b>running</b> <b>modes</b> providing the crucial normalization. For this reason, OLYMPUS had several redundant luminosity monitoring systems, including a pair of electromagnetic calorimeters positioned downstream from the target to detect symmetric Mø ller and Bhabha scattering from atomic electrons in the hydrogen gas target. Though this system was designed to monitor the rate of events with single Mø ller/Bhabha interactions, we found that a more accurate determination of relative luminosity could be made by additionally considering the rate of events with both a Mø ller/Bhabha interaction and a concurrent elastic ep interaction. This method was improved by small corrections for the variance of the current within bunches in the storage ring and for the probability of three interactions occurring within a bunch. After accounting for systematic effects, we estimate that the method is accurate in determining the relative luminosity to within 0. 36 %. This precise technique can be employed in future electron-proton and positron-proton scattering experiments to monitor relative luminosity between different <b>running</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R

Imaging a migrating cluster in vivo is feasible, but the quantification of individual cell behaviours remains challenging.

In addition to chaotic motion, previous studies reported that the migrating cells are able to migrate in a highly coordinated pattern. We quantify the rotating and running migration modes in 3 D while also observing a range of intermediate behaviours. <b>Running</b> <b>mode</b> is driven by cluster external protrusions.

40|$|The {{adoption}} of geothermal energy in space conditioning of buildings through utilizing {{ground source heat pump}} (GSHP, {{also known as}} geothermal heat pump) has increased rapidly during the past several decades. However, the impacts of the GSHP utilization on the efficiency of heat pumps and soil temperature distribution remained unclear and needs further investigation. This paper presents a novel model to calculate the soil temperature distribution and the coefficient of performance (COP) of GSHP. Different scenarios were simulated to quantify the impact of different factors on the GSHP performance, including heat balance, daily <b>running</b> <b>mode,</b> and spacing between boreholes. Our results show that GSHP is suitable for buildings with balanced cooling and heating loads. It can keep soil temperature at a relatively constant level for more than 10 years. Long boreholes, additional space between boreholes, intermittent <b>running</b> <b>mode</b> will improve the performance of GSHP, but large initial investment is required. The improper design will make the COP of GSHP even lower than traditional heat pumps.

The dry cooler can have two different <b>running</b> <b>modes.</b> In unloading mode the dry cooler is started at a certain temperature and the fans are slowed down at low temperatures so that the cooling power never exceeds the cooling demand. The extracted cooling is used to unload the boreholes. In recharging mode the dry cooler is started at a certain temperature and is operating at full capacity below this temperature. The excess cooling that is extracted in this mode is used to recharge the boreholes. The numerical simulation tool COMSOL Multiphysics was used to evaluate the borehole performance. The software can simulate tilted boreholes with good accuracy and makes it possible to adjust the geometry in any desired way.
