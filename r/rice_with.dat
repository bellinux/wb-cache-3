5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the Beast in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the Beast composer Menken reunited with <b>Rice,</b> <b>with</b> whom he had previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the Beast lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, {{similar to the way}} in which he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E
