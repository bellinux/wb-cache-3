5|$|Despite Tchaikovsky's {{disdain for}} public life, he now {{participated in it}} as part of his {{increasing}} celebrity and out of a duty he felt to promote Russian music. He helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, who was now director of Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive <b>relations</b> <b>among</b> various members of the staff. He served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–1890 season.

5|$|The Commission {{recommended}} {{that the federal government}} assume responsibility for financing social programs such as old-age pensions and unemployment insurance. It also argued that Ottawa should establish equity among provinces and that redistribution of federal tax revenues should be based on need, an idea that became central to Macdonald's thinking about federal-provincial <b>relations.</b> <b>Among</b> other things, the Commission called on the Macdonald government to continue paving roads; to undertake a program of rural electrification to keep young people on family farms; and, to establish a professional civil service that would defend Nova Scotia's interests against federal bureaucrats in Ottawa.|$|E

40|$|Buying {{is easier}} than {{shorting}} for many equity investors. Combining this arbitrage asymmetry with the arbitrage risk represented by idiosyncratic volatility (IVOL) explains the negative relation between IVOL and average return. The IVOL-return <b>relation</b> is negative <b>among</b> overpriced stocks but positive among underpriced stocks, with mispricing determined by combining 11 return anomalies. Consistent with arbitrage asymmetry, the negative <b>relation</b> <b>among</b> overpriced stocks is stronger, especially for stocks less easily shorted, so the overall IVOL-return relation is negative. Further supporting our explanation, high investor sentiment weakens the positive <b>relation</b> <b>among</b> underpriced stocks and, especially, strengthens the negative <b>relation</b> <b>among</b> overpriced stocks...|$|R

5|$|More recently, Japanese {{publications}} {{have emerged}} {{in an attempt to}} standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good <b>relations</b> <b>among</b> taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote Japan Taiko with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in kumi-daiko performance, methods of gripping, correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.|$|E
5|$|While {{he still}} felt a disdain for public life, Tchaikovsky now {{participated in it}} for two reasons—his {{increasing}} celebrity, and what he felt was his duty to promote Russian music. To this end, he helped support his former pupil Sergei Taneyev, {{now director of the}} Moscow Conservatory, by attending student examinations and negotiating the sometimes sensitive <b>relations</b> <b>among</b> various members of the staff. Tchaikovsky also served as director of the Moscow branch of the Russian Musical Society during the 1889–90 season. In this post, he invited a number of international celebrities to conduct, including Johannes Brahms, Antonín Dvořák and Jules Massenet. Tchaikovsky promoted Russian music both in his own compositions and in his role as a guest conductor. In January 1887 he substituted at the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow on short notice for the first three performances of his opera Cherevichki. Conducting was something the composer had wanted to master for at least a decade, as he saw that success outside Russia depended to some extent on conducting his own works. Within a year of the Cherevichki performances, Tchaikovsky was in considerable demand throughout Europe and Russia, which helped him overcome a life-long stage fright and boosted his self-assurance.|$|E

This phenomenon is known as type I spurious regression. Time series are dynamic processes, and the ignored system dynamics will become the systematic errors in regression equations. Differencing does not preserve the underlying <b>relation</b> <b>among</b> time series in regression due to systematic errors. This paper will outline how regression of differenced time series tends to reject the relation between their levels, and so potentially to incur type I spurious regression. type I spurious regression; systematic errors; invariant dynamic relations...|$|R
