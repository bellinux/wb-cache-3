During the next few months, the trustees established a broad range of supporting purposes: providing a comprehensive definition of spiritual abuse, working to reconcile leaders and members who were out of harmony, establishing a Members’ Bill of Rights, providing a forum for a reasonable and tempered discussion of governance in the Church, critiquing general conference, and identifying and documenting cases of spiritual and ecclesiastical abuse. Janice Merrill Allred and Lavina Fielding Anderson, two of the trustees, became co-chairs of the Case <b>Reports</b> <b>Committee</b> in the fall of 1992 and still serve in those positions.

40|$|What do lobbyists do? Some {{believe that}} lobbyists’ main {{role is to}} provide issue-specific {{information}} and expertise to congressmen to help guide the law-making process. Others believe that lobbyists mainly provide the firms and other special interests they represent with access to politicians in their “circle of influence” and that this access is the be-all and end-all of how lobbyists affect the lawmaking process. This paper combines a descriptive analysis with more targeted testing to get inside the black box of the lobbying process and inform {{our understanding of the}} relative importance of these two views of lobbying. We exploit multiple sources of data covering the period 1999 to 2008, including: federal lobbying registration from the Senate Office of Public Records, Federal Election Commission <b>reports,</b> <b>committee</b> and subcommittee assignments for the 106 th to 110 th Congresses, and background information on individual lobbyists. A pure issue expertise view of lobbying does not fit the data well. Instead, maintaining connections to politicians appears central to what lobbyists do. In particular, we find that whom lobbyists are connected to (through political campaign donations) directly affects what they work on. More importantly, lobbyists appear to systematically switch issues as the politicians they were previously connected to switch committee assignments, hence following people they know rather than sticking to issues. We also find evidence that lobbyists that have issue expertise earn a premium, but we uncover that such a premium for lobbyists that have connections to many politicians and Members of Congress is considerably larger. ...|$|E
40|$|From November 2010, the Australian Government 2 ̆ 7 s Senate Inquiry into former forced {{adoption}} {{policies and}} practices investigated almost four hundred submissions that included claims that past adoption practices were unethical, illegal and used undue influence to coerce never married mothers to relinquish their children. During the period 1945 - 1975 the demand for adoptable babies for infertile couples in Australia was at its peak, with over 45, 000 adoptions legalised in Victoria alone. At this time, {{often referred to as}} the 2 ̆ 7 heyday 2 ̆ 7 of adoption, up to sixty-eight per cent of never married mothers were separated from their babies. Adoption was characterised as a mutually advantageous solution that guaranteed the moral and social redemption of mother and child, with adoptive parents cast as benevolent and sympathetic. Within this context, the relinquishing mothers were marginalised, stigmatised, and unable to acknowledge their grief and loss. The assumption that such illegal and unethical practices would remain undocumented has underpinned the selection of oral history as the most appropriate investigative tool. However, although this research has been primarily informed by interviews with single mothers and former hospital staff, archival research has also provided rich documentary evidence with which to contextualise and corroborate this testimony. Hospital policy records, departmental <b>reports,</b> <b>committee</b> minutes, and correspondence, as well as a limited number of medical and case files, have confirmed punitive practices and the existences of policies that prescribed differential treatment for married and never married patients. Current interest in former forced adoption practices-both scholarly and governmental- provides an important backdrop, not only for the timing of this thesis, but in emphasising the need to improve the empirical evidence base on which to develop an appropriate policy response.;While some state governments have undertaken inquiries into these practices and others have made official apologies, such action remains to be seen in Victoria. Documenting delivery and adoption practices at Melbourne 2 ̆ 7 s Royal Women 2 ̆ 7 s Hospital (RWH), the largest maternity hospital in Victoria, this thesis hopes to inform moves towards an apology amid demands from mothers who have lost a child to adoption that past injustices be acknowledged. In the period 1945 - 1975, the dilemma facing the single mother was exacerbated by community attitudes and social values that embraced adoption as the solution to illegitimacy and infertility, and failed to provide viable alternatives. This thesis challenges the notion that single women willingly relinquished their babies at this time and argues that mothers faced enormous pressure from the moral pronouncements of the community, professionals, and particularly from their families. Within this social and historical framework, the {{policies and practices}} of the RWH were complicit in enabling and enforcing morally driven social norms that venerated the nuclear family and demonised the single mother...|$|E
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} field of information policy in a historic setting in Sweden, namely the early 1970 s. At the time the question of privacy in relation to databanks, data systems and personal records was intensively discussed in all public media, starting {{in the fall of}} 1970 when a large-scale population census was carried out in Sweden. The political discussions and public debate resulted in the first Swedish data protection law, Datalag (1973 : 289), and was counted {{as one of the first}} of this type of national legislation in the world. The focus of the empirical study lies in the analysis of the lines of arguments, political reasoning and debates concerning privacy, data protection, information and technology in documents such as official <b>reports,</b> <b>committee</b> reports, proposals and parliamentary records and publications that were produced in the policy process preceding the new legislation. The public debate itself is investigated through the editorials and reports in the daily press of the time. A combination of discourse analysis and agenda-setting theory, as it is presented and used by the political scientist John W Kingdon, constitutes the theoretical framework of the thesis. The study is introduced with a discussion concerning discourse and language use in politics, and here Norman Faircloughs CDA, Critical Discourse Analysis, has been the main inspiration. Kingdon’s agenda-setting model contributes with an interesting theoretical perspec¬tive on the social and political context of the discourses under study. The research questions also draw upon library and information science and theoretical work within the area of information policy, with issues concerning notions of information and technology, for example information as a public good versus private good in the market, and information as a free or restricted/protected resource. The main findings of the study imply that the political discussion and debate on databanks and privacy were heavily influenced by a public-oriented discourse focusing mainly on governmental authorities’ own use of information systems holding personal data. The new legislation, datalag (1973 : 289) could also be seen as a tool that sanctions governmental authorities’ extensive use and dependence on new data technologies and automatic data-processing in building up the welfare state and the growing public sector. The discourse was also based on a mixed notion of the new technology, perceiving data technology mainly as the “big machine” which contains a vast amount of personal information. This, at a time when the technology itself was transforming rapidly from bulky machines to personal computers. The practical effects of this discourse could be seen, for example, in the serious underestimation of the overall use of automatic data-processing in society as a whole, the use of which the legislation was set to regulate. When it comes to agenda-setting the public debate together with the activities of different actors in parliament had a major influence on the outcome of the work of the commission of inquiry that was set up. The public debate affected how the problem area of databanks and privacy was considered, but the commission formulated the actual legislation independently, without interference or adjustments by the social democratic government...|$|E
