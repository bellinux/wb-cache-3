2500|$|Though ECT {{has become}} a widely {{discouraged}} treatment, many people have <b>recently</b> <b>pushed</b> {{for the return of}} this controversial procedure. The 1975 film One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest has convinced viewers that ECT is a horrific procedure which only results in the patient's complete memory loss. Scientists have since debunked the notion that patients suffer acute memory loss after treatment, but the horrors of ECT present in the movie still remain a setback. In the last decade, patients have returned to using ECT to treat various mental illnesses including depression and bipolar disorder. Overcoming the looming controversy has proven difficult for doctors and scientists, and various campaigns to challenge negative stereotypes have gained popularity in the past few years. In 2014, the American Psychiatric Association launched a petition to reclassify ECT as a low-risk treatment. Though many people still believe ECT to be an inhumane procedure, many pro-ECT patients have publicly come forward with their positive response to the treatment. One patient by the name of Shelley Miller claims that [...] "medications have a success rate of 50-60% of patients getting better, while ECT succeeds at a rate of 70-90%." [...] With the combined support of patients and doctors, ECT is slowly challenging stereotypes and making its way back into the medical community. However, the negative stigma of ECT still maintains the upper hand in society today.|$|E

50|$|The Lua C API is stack based. Lua {{provides}} {{functions to}} push and pop most simple C data types (integers, floats, etc.) {{to and from}} the stack, as well as functions for manipulating tables through the stack. The Lua stack is somewhat different from a traditional stack; the stack can be indexed directly, for example. Negative indices indicate offsets {{from the top of the}} stack. For example, −1 is the top (most <b>recently</b> <b>pushed</b> value), while positive indices indicate offsets from the bottom (oldest value). Marshalling data between C and Lua functions is also done using the stack. To call a Lua function, arguments are pushed onto the stack, and then the lua_call is used to call the actual function. When writing a C function to be directly called from Lua, the arguments are read from the stack.|$|E

50|$|For example, an {{abstract}} stack, {{which is a}} last-in-first-out structure, could be defined by three operations: push, that inserts a data item onto the stack; pop, that removes a data item from it; and peek or top, that accesses a data item {{on top of the}} stack without removal. An abstract queue, which is a first-in-first-out structure, would also have three operations: enqueue, that inserts a data item into the queue; dequeue, that removes the first data item from it; and front, that accesses and serves the first data item in the queue. There would be no way of differentiating these two data types, unless a mathematical constraint is introduced that for a stack specifies that each pop always returns the most <b>recently</b> <b>pushed</b> item that has not been popped yet. When analyzing the efficiency of algorithms that use stacks, one may also specify that all operations take the same time no matter how many data items have been pushed into the stack, and that the stack uses a constant amount of storage for each element.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{state of}} {{competition}} and effects of introduction of number portability in mobile telecommunications, have varied largely across and within European markets. We discuss shortly the reasons behind the latter difference. Using Shy’s (2002) methodology, we analyze the change in switching costs among subscribers in Finnish 2 G mobile telecommunications market. We then assess the effect of introduction of mobile number portability (MNP) on these switching costs. We discuss the outcome {{from the perspective of}} our three categories of switching costs. Our results indicate that the threshold to switch from the largest operator has been considerably lowered since the introduction of MNP and that this is likely a result of decreasing learning and contractual costs. This, combined with existing price differences suggest that the ongoing equalization of market shares will continue in the future. We also show how one can, with operator level porting figures, determine the effects of switching costs on net flow of subscribers. Together with continuously lowered learning costs of switching, this may have set the industry on a slippery slope, where the undercutting proof equilibrium may prove to be hazardous for the future profitability. It can indeed be shown, that due to this fierce price competition, prices consistent with the undercutting proof equilibrium are close to if not below average cost. This, together with <b>recently</b> <b>pushing</b> the boundaries of communications law, may be seen as an investment in subscriber base for next generation technology and an important step from the competition policy point of view.

5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have <b>recently</b> emerged, <b>pushing</b> {{the bounds of}} what the gandingan was {{traditionally}} used for. One type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan. This type of play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous type of play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other.
