25|$|No. 84 Squadron {{was formed}} at RAAF Station Richmond, New South Wales, on 5 February 1943. It was {{selected}} as the first operational squadron to be equipped with Australian-designed CAC Boomerang fighters in March, but did not take delivery of any of these aircraft at the time. During late March the squadron moved to Horn Island in the Torres Strait via Cairns; its main party arrived on 1 April and the <b>rear</b> <b>party</b> disembarked on 1 May. No. 84 Squadron's first ten Boomerangs arrived at Horn Island on 4 April, and the squadron was declared operational that day. More Boomerangs arrived on 15 April, and by 1 May the squadron had a strength of 20 Boomerangs, 23 officers and 275 other ranks.|$|E
25|$|Using the few {{men that}} {{returned}} from the battle of Arnhem, the <b>rear</b> <b>party</b> of the seaborne tail and volunteers from other units, 181st (Airlanding) Field Ambulance was reformed on 1 March 1945, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant-Colonel I.C. Gilliland. However, by this stage in the war the 1st Airborne Division still reforming was not used in combat again. Instead following the surrender of the German occupation troops in Norway the division was sent there on 9 May 1945. The 181st left England on the 11 May and landed at Oslo that evening, establishing a hospital at Nordstrand. As well as supervising the German surrender the medics were also responsible for treating the numerous ex Russian prisoners of war. Some of the 181st accompanied the Russians to their homeland, becoming the first British Army troops to set foot in northern Russia since 1919. On 3 September 1945, the 181st left Oslo and on their arrival in England were quartered near Tidworth Camp, until 14 November 1945, 181st (Airlanding) Field Ambulance was disbanded.|$|E
500|$|In May 1915, the regiment, {{with the}} rest of the brigade, was warned to prepare to embark for the Gallipoli Campaign, serving in a {{dismounted}} role as part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). A <b>rear</b> <b>party</b> remained behind to look after the horses while twenty-six officers and 482 other ranks boarded the transport ships. On 12 May they landed at ANZAC Cove and the next day took over from the Royal Naval Brigade in the front line. The regiment was responsible for the section of the front known as [...] "Walker's Top" [...] and [...] "The Nek", opposite what was possibly the strongest Turkish position, only [...] away.|$|E

After the battalion returned to Gallipoli he handed the unit back to Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Plugge on 20 November, and then took command of the Canterbury Battalion where he was confirmed as a substantive lieutenant colonel.

500|$|The {{contingent}} began {{preparations for}} its return to Australia in December 1989. In January 1990 new works stopped, [...] manning of forward bases was reduced and stores and equipment were packed {{and prepared for}} sea. The Australian forces returned in four sorties on chartered commercial aircraft, the first departing Namibia on 6 February. The contingent's equipment loaded aboard the MV Kwang Tung, which left Walvis Bay on 22 February. The withdrawal included support from Australian logistics experts, a psychologist to conduct end-of-tour debriefings and a finance officer. The last demolition task was undertaken at Ondangwa on 25 March, and the last elements of the <b>rear</b> <b>party</b> left Namibia on 9 April 1990. During the deployment there were no fatalities; although at least 10 soldiers were treated for malaria, there were few serious injuries.|$|E

On 13 May 1919, the <b>rear</b> <b>party</b> left Vignacourt en route for Pembroke Dock; in Antrim, the regimental depot was closed and the remaining men there were transferred to the Curragh Camp prior to being demobbed. The regiment's horses were transferred to the 8th King's Royal Irish Hussars and the regiment was classed as [...] "disembodied", which in British Army parlance meant {{that it no longer}} existed except as a name on the Army List with a complement (in this case) of an Honorary Colonel, Honorary Chaplain, a Brevet Colonel (EA Maude), six majors, six subalterns and the quartermaster although these officers had no peacetime training commitments.|$|E

A minute later three or four more guns were discharged, the <b>rear</b> <b>party</b> having now joined the other, and being therefore able for the first time to fire.|$|E

Because of the hasty retreat of the Yeomen, the unsupported 4th Derbyshires were forced to surrender.
