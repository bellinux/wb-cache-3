40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{three issues}} in flexible rotor and magnetic bearing systems, namely control of rotor vibration, control of transmitted forces, {{and prevention of}} <b>rotor</b> <b>contact</b> with auxiliary bearings. An adaptive multi-objective optimization method is developed to tackle these issues simultaneously using a modified recursive open loop adaptive controller The proposed method involves automatic tuning of the weighting parameters in accordance with performance specifications. A two-stage weighting strategy is implemented involving base weightings, calculated from a singular value decomposition of the system's receptance matrices, and two adjustable weighting parameters to shift the balance between the three objective functions. The receptance matrices are functions of rotational speed and they are estimated in situ. The whole process does not require prior knowledge of the system parameters. Real-time implementation of the proposed controller is explained and tested by using an experimental flexible rotor magnetic bearing system. The rotor displacements were measured relative to the base frame using four pairs of eddy current displacement transducers. System stability is ensured through local PID controllers.

40|$|Vibrations {{associated}} with external disturbances and rotor faults, such as cracks, usually exhibit themselves as harmonic {{components of the}} synchronous frequency. The essence of the multi-frequency form of the synchronous recursive open loop adaptive controller (ROLAC) {{is that it can}} minimise a number of vibration components simultaneously, for example, synchronous rotor vibration at frequency Ω, its harmonics and sub-harmonics within any defined range. This requires on-line identification of the speed dependent partial receptance matrix by using a multifrequency test signal incorporating all of the pertinent harmonic components. The question arises: What is the degradation in performance if the <b>rotor</b> comes into <b>contact</b> with its retainer bearing? This may arise when a magnetically levitated rotor is installed on a movable base frame, for example on board a ship or an aircraft. A simulation study is described to examine this question. It comprises a flexible rotor supported by two active magnetic bearings. Eight displacement transducers are positioned along the rotor. A local PID controller is provided for each axis of the magnetic bearings to ensure stability and alignment of the rotor at a central position.

40|$|The {{case for}} {{installing}} auxiliary bearings {{in parallel with}} magnetic bearings is often made with regard to touchdown, when a complete system failure occurs. The work reported in this paper focuses on the case when rotor/auxiliary bearing contact occurs, but the magnetic bearings retain their functionality. One may envisage future transportation applications in which this situation would occur, for example, during high acceleration levels induced by turbulence. An understanding of the rotor dynamic response during contact conditions could enable auxiliary bearing life expectancy to be extended using appropriate control action from the still functional magnetic bearings. To achieve this, a system model is required for control strategy design purposes. This paper considers {{the development of a}} non-linear system model for predicting the contact dynamics in a flexible rotor/magnetic/auxiliary bearing system. Previous experimental work produced similar contact dynamic response characteristics; whether due to unbalance or circular forcing through a magnetic bearing. Initial model-based predictions of these tests did not provide sufficiently accurate reproduction of the measured orbits, particularly in the presence of auxiliary bearing misalignment and multi-plane <b>rotor</b> <b>contact.</b> Parameter variations are thus undertaken to investigate the reasons for these differences. Contrary to expectations, uncertainty in the magnetic bearing characteristics during contact conditions appears to offer an explanation...|$|E
40|$|It is now common {{practice}} to supplement a magnetic bearing with a touchdown bearing {{to protect the}} rotor and stator components. Rotor/touchdown bearing contact may arise from rotor drop, caused by power loss or emergency shutdown. This paper considers the control options that are viable when the magnetic bearing is still functional should contact arise from intermittent faults or overload conditions. The problem is that bi-stable rotor responses are possible, with and without contact. If <b>rotor</b> <b>contact</b> should become persistent, the desirable course of action is to destabilize the rotor response and induce a return to contact-free levitation. In order to achieve this, {{it is appropriate to}} gain an understanding of the rotor dynamic behavior. This is determined from analytical and simulated results to reveal suitable control actions. These may be applied through the magnetic bearing control system, or by activating the touchdown bearing through a separate control loop. The issue is that standard control action for a contact-free rotor state will not be appropriate for a rotor in persistent contact since the basic plants to be controlled are significantly different. The required control action should be activated only when contact is detected. The results demonstrate that appropriately phased synchronous forcing could destabilize synchronous forward rub responses. Alternatively, small whirl motions of a touchdown bearing could also be beneficial without disturbing the main magnetic bearing control loop...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{vibration}} characteristics of rotor displacement signals in a magnetic bearing system under conditions when <b>rotor</b> <b>contact</b> with auxiliary bearings is possible. Since these signals {{may be used}} for feedback control, it is necessary to determine how they may affect the ability of the controller to regain rotor levitation. An experimental system is used to demonstrate the sensitivity of the rotor non-linear dynamic behavior to unbalance, which is sufficient to cause contact during rotor run up through rigid body and flexural mode critical speeds. Complex rotor dynamics may involve contact with more than one auxiliary bearing or bush. Application of appropriate rotating forces to the rotor through a magnetic bearing is also shown to induce similar contact dynamics. Thus an alternative procedure for assessing the non-linear rotor dynamic behavior is established with the potential for identification of appropriate control forces. The contact dynamics are also considered in the presence of auxiliary bearing misalignment. Misalignment may arise through physical translation of a housing or through steady state offset errors in sensor measurements. A misalignment of 50 % of the nominal radial clearance is applied at an auxiliary bearing. Various contact modes are evident as the rotor is run up in speed. During run down different contact dynamics may be encountered and the level of such hysteresis is assessed...|$|E

40|$|During operation, a rotor/magnetic {{bearing system}} {{may be subject to}} various sources of vibration, either {{directly}} applied to the rotor or transmitted through the bearings owing to base motion. This paper considers controller designs that are capable of attenuating vibration arising from either source. It advances the current state of research in the area since other controller designs have considered only the direct forcing case. If base motion is not considered {{in the design of the}} controller then this disturbance may cause the bearing clearance limits to be reached. Controller design is formulated as an H optimization problem, with mixed design objectives. A new controller is derived that can simultaneously reduce vibration and minimize the effect of base motion on relative rotor to bearing displacement. Account is taken of the fact that the bearings can apply only limited control force. The design study was complemented by a programme of experimental work. The base of a rig was subjected to impulse inputs and the results show the effectiveness of the new controller design. It is demonstrated that proportional, integral and derivative (PID) controllers, or controllers designed for unbalance vibration attenuation only, may result in <b>rotor</b> <b>contact</b> with retainer bushes, while the new controller may prevent contact.

40|$|Most modern {{passenger}} cars have disc brakes {{on the front}} wheels, which unlike drum brakes are not sealed off to the ambient air. During braking, there is wear to both the rotor and the pads. This wear process generates particles, which may become airborne. A problem with measuring airborne wear particles in field tests is to distinguish them from the background noise. Therefore, a disc brake laboratory test stand that allows control of the cleanness of the surrounding air is used. With this test stand the number {{and size of the}} airborne wear particles from the pad to <b>rotor</b> <b>contact</b> can be measured online. In this technical report the results from two test series is presented. The first series were preformed at three brake cylinder pressure levels (1. 2, 1. 7 and 2. 2 bar) and the rotors were pre-conditioned in a climate chamber with an oxide layer (e. g. rust). Ceramic NAO, NAO and low metallic type brake pads were tested. The second test series were conducted at three low brake cylinder pressure levels (0. 1, 0. 5 and 1 bar) with NAO and low metallic type brake pads, without any oxide layer. Promising results from the first test series indicate that this test stand can be used to study oxide layer removal from the rotor. The results are also promising for the ability to rank the number and size distribution from different pad rotor material combinations.

40|$|Although the {{performance}} of twin screw compressors is heavily dependent on the rotor clearances within them, chamber models, used as design aids, allow for the specification of their magnitude and distribution but do not account for how these may vary during operation, {{as a result of}} internal temperature changes caused by the compression process. A validated procedure has therefore been developed to enable a chamber model to predict compressor performance, while including the effects of rotor and casing distortion resulting from dependant thermal effects. This has been achieved by the use of surface boundary mapping to calculate the rotor and casing temperature exposure within the compression chamber resulting from initial performance estimates. These detailed temperature distributions are processed analytically using appropriate assumptions that allow calculation of component temperatures and thermal growth. A program for calculation of leakage area curves has been adapted to support locally calculated variations in clearances. These updated area curves can then be fed back into the chamber model in an iterative procedure to simulate performance with thermally distorted clearances. The inclusion of thermal clearance corrections generally improved the accuracy of the chamber model when predictions from it were compared with test results over a wide range of operating pressures and temperatures. Furthermore, this work was found to be applicable in the evaluation of the interlobe clearance distribution between the rotors. Predicting clearance distortions and likely areas of rotor to <b>rotor</b> <b>contact</b> at a particular operating duty allows clearances to be optimised for the correct balance between performance and reliability; the results thus obtained were supported by findings from available test and tear down results...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2008 by SAGE PublicationsMagnetic {{bearings}} use magnetic {{forces to}} support various machine components. Because of the non-contact {{nature of this}} type of suspension, magnetic bearing technology offers a number of significant advantages over conventional bearings, such as rolling element and fluid film bearings. An active magnetic bearing basically consists of an electromagnetic actuator, position sensors, power amplifiers, and a feedback controller. All of these components are characterized by nonlinear behavior and therefore the entire system is inherently nonlinear. However, in simulations of the dynamic behavior of magnetic bearing systems, the nonlinearities are usually neglected to simplify the analysis and only linear models are used. Moreover, many control techniques currently used in magnetic bearing systems are generally designed by ignoring nonlinear effects. The main reason for simplification is the intractability of the complexity of the actual model. In fact, the inherent nonlinear properties of magnetic bearing systems can lead to dynamic behavior of a magnetically suspended rotor that is distinctly different from that predicted using a simple linearized model. Therefore, the nonlinearities should be taken into account. This literature review is focused on the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic bearing systems and it provides background information on analytical methods, nonlinear vibrations resulting from a <b>rotor</b> <b>contacting</b> auxiliary bearings, and other active topics of research involving the nonlinear properties of magnetic bearing systems, such as nonlinear self-sensing magnetic bearings and nonlinear control of magnetic bearings.
