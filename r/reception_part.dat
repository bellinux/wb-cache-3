40|$|An OFDM {{system is}} {{combined}} with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{in order to increase}} the diversity gain and system capacity over the time variant frequency-selective channels. However, a major drawback of MIMO-OFDM system is that the transmitted signals on different antennas might exhibit high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we present a PAPR analysis reduction of space-timeblock-coded (STBC) MIMO-OFDM system for 4 G wirelessnetworks. Several techniques have been used to reduce the PAPR of the (STBC) MIMOOFDM system: clipping and filtering, partial transmit sequence (PTS) and selected mapping (SLM). Simulation results show that clipping and filtering provides a better PAPR reduction than the others methods and only SLM technique conserve the PAPR reduction in <b>reception</b> <b>part</b> of signal.

40|$|Discussed here is {{the mobile}} <b>reception</b> <b>part</b> of a study to {{investigate}} a satellite sound broadcast system in the UHF or L bands. Existing propagation and reception measurements are used with proper interpretation to evaluate the signaling, coding, and diversity alternatives suitable for the system. Signal attenuation in streets shadowed by buildings appear to be around 29 db, considerably higher than the 10 db adopted by CCIR. With the marriage of proper technologies, an LMSS class satellite can provide substantial direct satellite audio broadcast capability in UHF or L bands for high quality mobile and portable indoor reception by low cost radio receivers. This scheme requires terrestrial repeaters for satisfactory mobile reception in urban areas. A specialized bandwidth efficient spread spectrum signalling technique is particularly suitable for the terrestrial repeaters...|$|E
40|$|A novel {{technique}} for implementing statistical multiplexing (StatMux) of broadcast services over Digital Video Broadcasting for Handhelds (DVB-H) channels is proposed. DVB-H uses a time-sliced transmission scheme {{to reduce the}} power consumption used for radio <b>reception</b> <b>part</b> in DVB-H receivers. Due to the time-sliced transmission scheme, the implementation of known StatMux methods for DVB-H application presents some challenges which are addressed in this paper. The proposed StatMux technique is implemented {{in conjunction with the}} time-slicing transmission scheme. The combination is similar to a time division multiplexing (TDM) scheme. The proposed StatMux method considerably decreases the end-to-end delay of DVB-H services while it maximizes the usage of available bandwidth. Moreover, the proposed method can effectively decrease the channel switching delay of DVB-H services. Simulation results show a high performance for the proposed StatMux method. © 2009 Mehdi Rezaei et al...|$|E

In fixed satellite communication, as a rule, especially in MMSC many users are active at the same time. The problem of simultaneous communications between many single or multipoint mobile satellite users can be solved by using MA technique, such as Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA), Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) and Random (Packet) Division Multiple Access (RDMA). Since the resources of the systems such as the transmitting power and the bandwidth are limited, it is advisable to use the channels with complete charge and to create a different MA to the channel. This generates a problem of summation and separation of signals in the transmission and reception parts, respectively. Deciding this problem consists in the development of orthogonal channels of transmission in order to divide signals from various users unambiguously on the <b>reception</b> <b>part...</b>|$|E

As VLC {{continues}} to develop, {{the need to protect}} valuable informationtransmitted using this type of communication is also growing. We aim to protect thisvaluable information by proposing a security application in which the data is encryptedin a multiple-light system and only recoverable in specific locations of a movingpattern within specific time. We use the Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm as basis forthe encryption combined with additional algorithms to provide a more securetransmission. The application is formed by the Physical Layer which is in charge ofproviding the optimal configuration for transmission and the Application Layer inwhich we implement the encryption and decryption algorithms for the application. The Physical Layer is formed by a group of LED bulbs controlled by an FPGA usingPWM to represent the information. We propose a scheduling algorithm in which thelights are scheduled in a bit-by-bit manner. The <b>reception</b> <b>part</b> is formed by theOPT 101 optical receiver connected to the ultra-low power TS 881 comparator. Asecond FPGA is in charge of demodulating the signals from the comparator bymeasuring the period of each signal to detect the corresponding bit.

40|$|In this Trabajo de Fin de Grado (TFG, {{from now}} on), the main {{objective}} {{is to determine the}} radar cross section of perfect electrical conducting objects by numerically solving the Electric Field Integral Equation, using the Method of Moments. A numerical code implementation of the MoM is carried out in this TFG, taking into account all implementation details for an accurate solution to EFIE. The Method of Moments is a numerical analysis technique that is used to solve the Maxwell Equations, like other numerical methods such as the Finite Element Method but, unlike this last one, which determines the electric field in volumetric elements solving the Electric Field Differential Equation, the Method of Moments solves the Electric Field Integral Equation obtaining the surface current in triangular elements, and when the current distribution in the object is known, then the total electric field in any point of the space can be obtained. In this TFG it will be explained in detail how to get to the Electric Field Integral Equation, starting from Maxwell’s Electromagnetic Equations in the frequency domain, as well as how to numerically solve the problem to sufficiently well approximated results. Since a direct approach to the topic might be of high complexity, a brief introduction of the Method of Moments is given, and an electrostatic problem is also solved, as a demonstration. The project focuses on the study of the frequency behavior of the radar cross section, both monostatic (where the <b>reception</b> <b>part</b> of the radar is placed in the same location as the transmission one) and bistatic (where the transmission and reception parts of the system are in different locations), of metallic objects of moderate electric size. The radar cross section of an object measures the strength of the scattering that the object produces when an electromagnetic plane wave impacts on it. Finally, the influence of the geometry in the electrical behavior of the different perfect electrical conducting objects to the incidence of an electromagnetic plane wave is detailed. This is an important factor since the direction of the incident plane wave determines whether the object will be more or less visible to the radar...|$|E
40|$|We {{have been}} invited by Politics & Gender's editors to review the origins and current {{standing}} of the Data Access and Research Transparency (DA-RT) policy, an effort initiated by the eponymous American Political Science Association (APSA) Ad Hoc Committee and led primarily by Colin Elman, Diana Kapiszewski, and Arthur (“Skip”) Lupia. We have not been bystanders in this unfolding history, and in keeping with feminist and interpretive epistemologies that inform our work and that tie positionality to knowledge claims (e. g., Haraway 1988), we include mention of our own involvement (see Mala Htun's 2016 parallel account of her activities). Herein lies one of our main points in assessing DA-RT: {{from the perspective of}} interpretive, feminist, and some other qualitative methods, transparency as an epistemological mandate is not new. On the contrary, it is widely accepted, and expected, within certain epistemic communities (noted also in Yanow and Schwartz-Shea 2014); it needs no set of new rules imposed from above, by journal editors and others, for its instantiation. Our assessment includes questions about the relationship between APSA and DA-RT, as the association's support has colored DA-RT's <b>reception.</b> <b>Part</b> of what we seek to account for is resistance on the part of political scientists of various sorts—and not only those in the interpretive community, which we know best—to the DA-RT initiative and even to the participatory Qualitative Transparency Deliberations (QTD) process designed by Alan Jacobs and Tim Büthe (2015) at the invitation of the APSA organized section Qualitative and Multi-Method Research (QMMR; see, e. g., Isaac 2016). Even as we see changes in representations of DA-RT in response to critiques, we are concerned that those questioning the substance of DA-RT and the process of its adoption by APSA (in the Ethics Guidelines) and various journals are being represented by its architects as “either not paying attention to what we have been doing or [as] purposely misrepresenting the project,” including presenting “conspiracy theories, enemy narratives, and speculation about others' motives” (Elman and Lupia, 2106, 45, 50).

The study on translated children's literature in China is significant {{not only to the}} research on Chinese children's literature, but also to Chinese translation history. At present the study on translated children's literature {{both at home and abroad}} occupies a marginalized position. Particularly in China, the limited research that has been done on the subject is of poor quality. Key words. Translation Studies; translated children's literature; poetics; patronage; linguistic elements; personality; influence study; reception. This dissertation combines the methods taken from Descriptive Translation Studies, children's literature research and Comparative Literature to describe and analyze the production, reception and influence of translated children's literature in China during the period of 1898 - 1949. Based on two catalogues compiled by the author of this dissertation, namely, A Catalogue of Translated Children's Literature During 1898 - 1919 and A Catalogue of Translated Children's Books During 1911 - 1949, the dissertation describes a picture of translated children's literature in China during the period of 1898 - 1949. The production of translated children's work is analyzed from four perspectives: poetics, patronage, linguistic elements and personality of translators. The <b>reception</b> <b>part,</b> based on the reception models by Yves Chevrel, takes Curoe translated by XIA Mianzun, The Watch translated by LU Xun, and "Translated Russian Children's Literature in China" as three case studies to examine the reception of translated children's literature in the Chinese context. The influence part adopts the methodology of chronology and doxologie to prove and conduct the detailed aspects of the influence of translated children's literature upon indigenous Chinese children's literature from three aspects: techniques, content and image. The dissertation ends with an outlook for future research on translated children's literature in China. 李麗. 論文(哲學博士) [...] 香港中文大學, 2006. 參考文獻(p. 222 - 238). Adviser: Chee Fun Fong.

In 1943 after hearing about the Bracero Program in a national ad, Eduardo took a chance to make more money and have a better opportunity through the program. Eduardo and one of his brothers came to the United States via train and were provided food during their travel, courtesy of their new employer. Everything was in order during the trip to the United States and for Eduardo everything was good and in order here in the United States as well. During the <b>reception</b> <b>part</b> of the process, their clothes were taken away and replaced with new clothes and the new braceros were able to wash up in showers provided for them; showers that according to Eduardo were very elegant. He earned $ 0. 50 cents per hour, for a nine hour day, in cash. Eduardo and his brother were provided with a place to sleep as well as meals and if they were out and about with the employer and it came time to eat, the employer would pay for the meals. In addition, they were provided with medical insurance as per their contract with their employer. Eduardo and his brother worked for one employer who treated them very well. The employer, according to Eduardo, treated them like family, provided well for them, ate meals with them and greatly respected the wishes of the workers. Eduardo is very thankful for this employer and feels that due to the generosity of his employer, Eduardo was able to be more successful. Eduardo sent money to his parents as often as he could, {{while at the same time}} saving money as well. Since he was hired to work for a certain salary, Eduardo did not earn more than what he was contracted for. However, he states that he was never cheated out of the correct amount of earnings and 10 % was deducted from their earnings and deposited in the National Bank in México. Eduardo and his brother were always together and were able to come and go as they pleased. Eduardo worked in the Bracero Program for three years. After those three years, he and his brother returned to México to reclaim the 10 % that removed from their earnings. Eduardo returned to the United States illegally. He eventually met and married a woman who was a citizen of the United States and together they worked on Eduardo becoming a legalized citizen of the United States. Prior to working in the program, Eduardo never considered going north to the United States, however, he is thankful to God that he was able to come to the United States to work and be successful.

40|$|The creed of Faculty of Architecture in TU Delft is “Design by Research. ” The {{graduation}} {{studio of}} Complex Project is really embodiment of this creed. In Msc 3, we put emphasizes {{on the research}} of Chicago City, which our graduation projects located in. We found many interesting facts about this city, {{which leads to the}} final master plan of Chicago south works and my own individual project. Indeed, Chicago is the center city of Midwest of U. S., but it is said “Chicago is the capital of nothing”. In the national level, the economy and population share of Midwest in America decreased dramatically in the last few decades. So did the city ranking of Chicago. Chicago, a city without an obvious city brand, cannot compete with other big cities in America, such as L. A., D. C., or New York. The question is not whether Chicago belongs to the highly appreciated jet set of global cities: Chicago is a global city. It has the appropriate combination of human resources, manufacturing businesses and world institutions. It is control point for eleven of the most successful corporations in the world. Nearly 30 % of the 104 Fortune 500 companies, which headquartered in the Midwest, are located in the Chicago metropolitan area. These companies generated over $ 443 billion revenues in 2005. However, Chicago’s lacks critical attributes associated with a true global city: a critical center of a significant industry. Finance in New York, entertainment in Los Angeles, government in Washington, and so on. Perhaps this lack of definition, could very well serve to be its most strategic element. For a city of this size its main vision is to become an “alpha” city, a true global player, one could assume that the overall image of the region and the involved cities, hold Chicago back from its true potential. However, the strategic organization of the region, via transportation and mobility, as well as its strong cultural definition, could provide Chicago the resources and ability to develop a Global Appeal. Therefore, the development of Chicago and its ability to unify the Midwest into a cohesive and functional region, will further define it as the ‘heart of the heat, and allow it to compete with New York and LA. The Lakeside city will be explored, as the site with an ambition to help Chicago achieve its Global ambitions. In order to achieve its ambition, the strength of the Midwest should be unified, which are agriculture, academic research institutions, culture, landscape and fresh water resource in Great Lakes. Therefore, the urban strategy is obvious, to propose an agriculture research center to unify the academic research and agricultural resource in Midwest and to propose a high speed rail station to improve its mobility and accessibility. The methods we applied during the master plan phase are mainly collage. We conducted a lot of research on research center and research facilities, which helps us to propose the agriculture research center for South Works site. During the research of some well-organized research incubators, we research the program ratio of them, which help us to frame our own program bar in the proposed research park. Also, the sites of the research campus are collaged into our site, {{so that we can get}} the basic impression of the scale of research facility. The south works site is formerly a steel company. The site is abandoned since 1970 s’, because of the shrink of steel industry. But, the south works site located near the Michigan Lake, which means the research center, would have a great view of the lake. The site is split into two parts by one slip river lies in the middle of site and goes from west to east. Therefore, in the north part, we proposed a research park concentrating on biogenetic research of agriculture, which needs a lot of indoor research space. This is an “urban” area. On the contrary, the south side is a “rural” area, which concentrates on agriculture research and asks for a vast land for research field. My own individual project is in the south of the site, which is a high rise agriculture research building. In the master plan, we only proposed sevral buildings with high density. So that it would leave vast land for field. The agriculture research community would rather be a rural land area than an urban area. In addition to that, this area would have clear identity, the vast rural land and high rise agricultural research tower. (fig- 01) I split the program volumes into small pieces. The dimensions of these small pieces are based on the typology research of research buildings in those top ranking agricultural research schools and institutions. So, we can draw some simple conclusions of those research buildings. Normally, the research buildings are in ‘U’-shape or ‘L’-shape. The width of a research building is normally 18 m, which is suitable for a 3 m corridor and two 7. 5 m wide labs are on both sides. The dimensions of offices and service area are much more similar to research part. The width of it is about 7. 5 m to 9 m. The dimensions of conference hall are much bigger. In my case, the dimensions of conference hall are 24 m by 36 m, and about 15 m high. And so does the <b>reception</b> <b>part.</b> Now that the dimension of each part differs from each other, we can create an interesting volume if we stack those volumes on top of each other. (fig- 02) From outside of the building, it is rather a random appearance. But in the sense of architecture design, it should be logical somehow. The entirely random scheme is assembled by small blocks and units. But what if I organize those building blocks in a logical way? What I’m thinking is to apply the organization of burr puzzle, which is a 3 D puzzle to assemble some identical blocks into a stiff shape, so that it cannot be easily tear apart. (fig- 03) For a high rise building, it should be resistant under two conditions, gravity and wind load. For structural concern, burr puzzle is a flexible system and can be easily withstand gravity and wind load when it is translated into building. For my project, I think the most important aspect is the architectural expression of it. As a kind of abstract metaphor of the burr puzzle, the shape of the building is assembled by many similar two-storey cuboids with refined truss on the facade. The two high-rise towers are connected by a plinth. Some collective functions are contained, such as the auditorium, library and gym. The research programs are mainly in the high tower, while the research offices are mainly in the lower tower. The research part and office part are all in blocks with notches. Half of the blocks are connected to concrete cores, the other half are resting on the first half. The interlocking structure can guarantee the building to be persistent in gravity and wind load. Research helps us to build our own toolbox which consists of all the information we got of the site and context. Although not all of them are directly helpful for the design, it helps to figure out what is needed to be done, especially in architectural design phase. The research we did about spatial condition before P 2 helps to sharp the idea of what kind of intervention should be taken and why it should happen in the place we choose. It helps to make the storyline coherent from the urban strategy to an architectural project. And only by these means, after figuring out what should be there, we architects can bring our personal emotion and feelings to the design process. The research can protect the design process from being arrogant and make it more convincing. Master Programme in ArchitectureArchitectureArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|E
