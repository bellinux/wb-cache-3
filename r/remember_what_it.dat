"That was a {{conscious}} move by Max and myself, {{because we were}} listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song– I don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. I said, 'Ah, I love this song,' and Max was like, 'If they would just write a damn pop chorus on it!' It was driving him nuts, because that indie song was sort of on six, going to seven, going to eight, the chorus comes ... and it goes back down to five. It drove him crazy. And when he said that, it was like, light bulb. 'Why don't we do that, but put a big chorus on it?' It worked." ...|$|E
500|$|Books and {{characters}} in the series were inspired by books and films. For example, the character Slappy the Dummy {{was inspired by the}} literary classic The Adventures of Pinocchio. Some of Stine's ideas for the books also came from real life; Stine got the idea for the book The Haunted Mask after his son, Matt, had a Halloween mask that he had trouble getting off. Stine also uses his childhood fears to help him write his books. The author said, [...] "Luckily, I have a great memory. As I write a story, I can <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> feels like to be afraid and panicky". Stine states that he often thinks of a title to a novel first, then lets the title lead him to a story.|$|E
500|$|Hoffman's profile {{continued}} to grow with the new decade, and he became an increasingly recognizable figure. Despite earlier reservations about directing for the screen, his first release of the 2010s was also his first as a film director. The independent drama Jack Goes Boating was adapted from Robert Glaudini's play of the same name, in which Hoffman had starred and directed for the LAByrinth Theater Company in 2007. He originally intended only to direct the film, but decided to reprise the main role of Jack– a lonely limousine driver looking for love– after the actor he wanted for it was unavailable. The low-key film had a limited release, and was not a high earner, though it received many positive reviews. However, Dave Edwards of the Daily Mirror remarked that [...] "Hoffman's directing debut delivers a film so weak I could barely <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was about as I left", while critic Mark Kermode appreciated the cinematic qualities that Hoffman brought to the film, and stated that he showed potential as a director. In addition to Jack Goes Boating, in 2010 Hoffman also directed Brett C. Leonard's tragic drama The Long Red Road for the Goodman Theatre in Chicago. Steven Oxman of Variety described the production as [...] "heavy handed" [...] and [...] "predictable", but [...] "intriguing and at least partially successful".|$|E

500|$|Wanting {{to stray}} {{away from the}} R-styled music of Thankful, which she {{described}} as a showcase of versatility, she revealed that Thankfuls success [...] "empowered me to step more into rock, step more into the soulful vibe." [...] She described {{the music of the}} second album as [...] "like the first CD in the sense that it's versatile, but it's more into the rock, It's more into the soulful roots, and it's just a little bit deeper, so it's pretty cool." [...] Dr. Luke revealed in an interview that alternative music and indie music were inspirations to [...] "Since U Been Gone", saying, [...] "That was a conscious move by Max [...] and myself, because we were listening to alternative and indie music and talking about some song-I don't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was.

[...] Songs such as [...] "Behind These Hazel Eyes", and [...] "Because of You" [...] were also inspired by her real life experiences, the former about her relationship with an ex-boyfriend and the latter about her experience after her parents' divorce.|$|E
2500|$|Michelle Remembers chronicles Pazder's {{therapy in}} the late 1970s with his long-time patient Smith. In 1973 Pazder first started {{treating}} Smith at his private psychiatric practice in Victoria, British Columbia. In 1976 when Pazder was treating Smith for depression (related to her having had a miscarriage), Smith confided {{she felt that she}} had something important to tell him, but could not <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> was. Shortly thereafter, Pazder and Smith had a session where Smith screamed for 25 minutes non-stop and eventually started speaking in the voice of a five-year-old. Over the next 14 months Pazder spent over 600 hours using hypnosis to help Smith recover alleged memories of Satanic ritual abuse that occurred when she was five in 1954 and 1955 at the hands of her mother (Virginia Proby) and others, all of whom Smith said were members of a [...] "Satanic cult" [...] in Victoria.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the members}} left Opeth, Mikael Åkerfeldt and David Isberg {{began to write}} the songs. Åkerfeldt commented about: [...] "As you might {{understand}} I {{was more or less}} influenced by the occult back then, although in no serious manner. Music wise I was really into the twisted, dark, and evil-sounding riffs. The lyrics written by both me and David were pure Satanic chantings!" [...] According to Åkerfeldt, [...] "the idea for Opeth was for it to be evil—satanic lyrics and evil riffs. I chose my notes so they sounded evil." [...] The first two songs that Åkerfeldt and Isberg wrote were [...] "Requiem of Lost Souls" [...] and [...] "Mystique of the Baphomet" [...] (later [...] "Mark of the Damned" [...] and later [...] "Forest of October"). When Isberg quit the band, Åkerfeldt and Peter Lindgren [...] "really felt that we had found a real original way of playing. There were at the time almost no other band [...] using that many harmonies as we did." [...] "Forest of October" [...] "is the best song on the album", according to Lindgren. Åkerfeldt says he doesn't <b>remember</b> <b>what</b> <b>it</b> is about, and that he only remembers that he wrote the lyrics to sound like the music.|$|E
