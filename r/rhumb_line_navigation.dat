5000|$|The name {{is derived}} from Old French or Spanish respectively: [...] "rumb" [...] or [...] "rumbo", a line on the chart which intersects all meridians at the same angle. On a plane surface {{this would be the}} {{shortest}} distance between two points. Over the Earth's surface at low latitudes or over short distances it can be used for plotting the course of a vehicle, aircraft or ship. Over longer distances and/or at higher latitudes the great circle route is significantly shorter than the rhumb line between the same two points. However the inconvenience of having to continuously change bearings while travelling a great circle route makes <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> <b>navigation</b> appealing in certain instances.|$|E
40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model for a}} comparative analysis of great circle vs. <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> <b>navigation</b> in the continental United States has been developed at the Avionics Engineering Center, Ohio University. A FORTRAN simulation of the model has been implemented on the IBM 370 computer. The simulation predicts pertinent navigation information for the two flight paths. The basis for the project, which {{is a part of}} an M. S. thesis, is to provide a data base for computing discrepancies between the two flight paths. This document briefly describes the model and discusses the implications of the results obtained...|$|E
50|$|Meridians of {{longitude}} and parallels of latitude provide {{special cases}} of the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line,</b> where their angles of intersection are respectively 0° and 90°. On a north-south passage the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course coincides with a great circle, as it does on an east-west passage along the equator.|$|R
40|$|In {{this article}} Mid-latitude and mid-longitude rules {{are used to}} find the free turning point along the Great Circle ensuing {{optimized}} distance. Namely, to reach Great Circle vertex with two <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> legs ensuing optimized distance, an initial <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course equal to the orthodromic course at Mid-latitude may be used. The initial course is thereupon optimized by the incremental value steps. Alternatively, mid-longitude point at the same Great Circle can be beneficial in optimizing process. Optimized distance is achieved if the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course is altered towards the vertex at the orthodrome-loxodrome intersection point...|$|R
5000|$|The point can be {{illustrated}} with an East-West passage over 90 degrees of longitude along the equator, {{for which the}} great circle and <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> distances are the same at 5400 nmi km. At 20 degrees north the great circle distance is 4997 mi while the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> distance is 5074 mi, about [...] percent further. But at 60 degrees north the great circle distance is 2485 mi while the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> is 2700 mi, a difference of [...] percent. A more extreme case is the air route between New York City and Hong Kong, for which the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> path is 9700 nmi km. The great circle route over the North Pole is 7000 nmi km, or [...] hours less flying time at a typical cruising speed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Rhumb</b> <b>line</b> : The {{shortest}} route on paper — i.e. on a Mercator projection chart — is a route which steers a constant compass course, {{known as the}} <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> route; this is 2,902 nautical miles.

50|$|Early navigators in {{the time}} before the {{invention}} of the marine chronometer used <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> courses on long ocean passages, because the ship's latitude could be established accurately by sightings of the Sun or stars but there was no accurate way to determine the longitude. The ship would sail north or south until the latitude of the destination was reached, and the ship would then sail east or west along the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> (actually a parallel, which is a special case of the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line),</b> maintaining a constant latitude and recording regular estimates of the distance sailed until evidence of land was sighted.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> can be {{contrasted with}} a great circle, which is the path of {{shortest}} distance between two points {{on the surface of}} a sphere. On a great circle, the bearing to the destination point does not remain constant. If one were to drive a car along a great circle one would hold the steering wheel fixed, but to follow a <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> one would have to turn the wheel, turning it more sharply as the poles are approached. In other words, a great circle is locally [...] "straight" [...] with zero geodesic curvature, whereas a <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> has non-zero geodesic curvature.|$|R

5000|$|Converting ruler {{distance}} on the Mercator map into true (great circle) {{distance on}} the sphere is straightforward along the equator but nowhere else. One {{problem is the}} variation of scale with latitude, and another is that straight lines on the map (<b>rhumb</b> <b>lines),</b> other than the meridians or the equator, do not correspond to great circles. The distinction between rhumb (sailing) distance and great circle (true) distance was clearly understood by Mercator. (See Legend 12 on the 1569 map.) He stressed that the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> distance is an acceptable approximation for true great circle distance for courses of short or moderate distance, particularly at lower latitudes. He even quantifies his statement: [...] "When the great circle distances which are to be measured {{in the vicinity of}} the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a great circle, or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in northern parts it is convenient to use <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> distances".|$|R

40|$|This work tackles {{the problem}} of {{misconception}} when using sophisticated mathematical tools, nonlinear optimization in this particular case, to solve a navigational problem. Namely, to reach the Great Circle vertex with two <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> legs ensuing the optimized distance, an initial <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course equal to the orthodromic course at middle latitude may be used. The initial course is thereupon optimized by the incremental value steps. The optimized distance is achieved if the <b>rhumb</b> <b>line</b> course is altered towards the vertex at the orthodrome-loxodrome intersection point. As determination of this point cannot be formulated in a closed form, an iterative solution is to be applied. The derived transcendental equation forms a basis for an iterative solution of intersection using the Newton-Raphson method. To the contrary, finding solutions {{to a system of}} nonlinear equations can mislead a researcher unable to comprehend and grasp the mathematical meanings of the algorithm.
