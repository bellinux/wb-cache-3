Because {{of the difficulty of}} building <b>refrigerated</b> <b>ships</b> only two were delivered in 1944, and just 26 were delivered in 1945 and the remainder in 1946-48.

The United Fruit Company operated many of the R type ships in World War 2. The type R2-S-BV1 became the US Navy Alstede-class stores ship and the type R1-M-AV3 became the US Navy Adria-class stores ship.|$|R
