30|$|In {{the legacy}} {{multicast}}, the multicast <b>route</b> <b>tree</b> is built by exchanging join/leave messages between the network elements, whereby {{the branch of}} multicast <b>route</b> <b>tree</b> would be constructed or cut off. However, considering the feature of the IPTV network environment where the multicast channel is rapidly changed, {{it is difficult to}} accommodate the fast channel switching with the legacy approach. Moreover, the legacy approach cannot support the efficient utilization for core network resource. These limitations of the legacy approach can be resolved by introducing the multicast admission control techniques [14, 15] that provide the key functionalities such as admission control and resource reservation for the multicast sessions. Note that these techniques commonly require online algorithms in order to cope with the change of the network environment adaptively.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — ZigBee is a {{specification}} for wireless personal area networks {{with low}} power, low cost, {{and a low}} data rate. It’s defined by IEEE 802. 15. 4 standard. In ZigBee wireless network, tree topology is commonly practiced to form wireless sensor networks and perform data delivery applications. In an environment splendidly connected with ZigBee devices, major topological changes can occur due to device failures, mobility and other factor. The reconstruction method designed to reduce the effect of topology changes. In this paper, we explain reduces the frequency <b>route</b> <b>tree</b> construction in mobility patterns and increase the data delivery ratio, and reduce the packet loss caused by node mobility of <b>route</b> <b>tree</b> construction. Overhearing mechanism also includes for mobile nodes to improve the data delivery ratio. We develop an efficient algorithm for mobility based tree construction. The effectiveness framework network topologies constructed using ZigBee is verified by NS 2 simulation against a real world circumstances.

40|$|One of the {{difficulties}} with standard route maps is accessing to multi-scale routing information. The user needs to display maps in both a large scale to see details and a small scale to see an overview, but this requires tedious interaction such as zooming in and out. We propose to use a hierarchical structure for a route map, called a “Route Tree”, to address this problem, and describe an algorithm to automatically construct such a structure. A <b>Route</b> <b>Tree</b> is a hierarchical grouping of all small route segments to allow quick access to meaningful large and small-scale views. We propose two <b>Route</b> <b>Tree</b> applications, “RouteZoom ” for interactive map browsing and “TreePrint” for route information printing, to show the applicability and usability of the structure. We conducted a preliminary user study on RouteZoom, and {{the results showed that}} RouteZoom significantly lowers the interaction cost for obtaining information from a map compared to a traditional interactive map...|$|E

30|$|Now {{the concept}} of cluster, as will be {{described}} more clearly in Section 3.2, was selected because {{the end result of}} the route discovery phase is the creation of a <b>route</b> <b>tree,</b> rooted at the sink. In this tree, when several branches converge together into a common node, it means that this common node will be in charge of forwarding traffic on behalf of all of the nodes included in those branches. So, we decided to allow the common node to be the head of a cluster and to have the next node in each branch to also be part of the same cluster; this way we can allow these nodes to communicate by scheduling them to be active {{at the same time as}} members of the same cluster.|$|E
30|$|We {{assume that}} {{requests}} of multicast connections come in {{one at a}} time and any bandwidth information on links is known in the initial routing, barely changes during the routing period, and is available to the server which performs a centralized route computation by provisioning or administrative mechanism. In addition, we assume that the request either arrives directly to the server in the case of manual setting or may first arrive at the ingress node and then query to the server to generate the explicit <b>route</b> <b>tree.</b> For calculating the explicit multicast tree, the server needs to know the current topology and available bandwidth. Therefore, we assume that the topology is either known administratively or that the link-state database of node is accessible. Once the information of the explicit multicast tree is determined by the server, it is distributed to the nodes included in the multicast connection in order to reserve the bandwidth of request on each link. The multicast routing algorithm keeps the initial link bandwidth and the record of the residual bandwidth of all the links.|$|E
40|$|Class project {{submission}} for CS 262 A. Please do not cite or distribute beyond NEST. Contact {{the authors}} {{for the latest}} version. We present an effective distributed power scheduling algorithm for fixed, low bandwidth, many to one data collection sensor network applications. DuraNet reduces energy consumption by avoiding collision and overhearing while having nodes sleep most of the time. Because {{that it is hard}} to achieve global time synchronization while nodes are sleeping, DuraNet avoids the traditional approach where global hard bound time slots are assigned to nodes for communication. Instead, there is no notion of global time in DuraNet. Nodes allocate schedules for each link based on contention in a schedule formation phase, then re-use these schedules for a long period of time. By doing so, DuraNet is able to adapt to density, while providing significant energy savings. Given a <b>route</b> <b>tree</b> topology, DuraNet is also able to avoid congestion due to buffer queue overflow by careful scheduling. We compare our algorithm to low power listening and classic CSMA through extensive simulation in TOSSIM[12]. We find that DuraNet achieves significant energy reduction over classic CSMA and low power listening, while providing similar end-to-end reliability. ...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the size}} of on-chip memory greatly affects the chip cost, sensors {{targeting}} at tiny size and low cost cannot af-ford large memory module. How to route packets effi-ciently in networks containing memory constraint nodes is an interesting and challenging research topic. In this pa-per, we propose an integrated routing protocol for large-scale sensor networks consisting of both memory-constraint nodes and memory-sufficient nodes. In our de-sign, a spanning-tree is first built to ensure that every node pair is connected through a <b>tree</b> <b>route.</b> Source nodes can directly use <b>tree</b> <b>routes</b> to deliver short or urgent mes-sages; they can also choose to discover shortcuts through a reactive routing process.

30|$|Without using {{compressive}} sensing in data aggregation, nodes {{near the}} leaves forward {{a small amount}} of packets, but those which are close to the sink node need to forward a large number of packets [28 – 30]. With using compressive sensing in data aggregating, each node simply forwards M packets, so the total transmission number of the network with N nodes is MN. However, transmission quantity is still large. References [6 – 10] proposed a hybrid protocol. In this protocol, nodes near the leaves forward original data without using compressive sensing, and those which are close to the sink node use compressive sensing technology to transmit data. References [31 – 35] applied hybrid compressive sensing to the data aggregating and proposed a minimum energy aggregation tree. The previous work directly applies compressive sensing method to the <b>route</b> <b>tree.</b> Since clustering method has many advantages over the routing tree [36 – 40], compressive sensing method on clustering network is applied. Compared with routing tree data aggregating methods, clustering algorithm generally has a better communication load balance [41, 42]. In addition, previous works ignore the distribution of location information and node distribution, which can contribute that data aggregating consumes less energy in WSNs of the Internet of Things [43 – 47].|$|E
5000|$|In {{many places}} along the <b>route,</b> <b>trees</b> {{had to be}} felled or have their tops cut off in order to {{maintain}} the sight lines between stations. French telegraph operators had already recognized that signals were hard to recognize if they came from stations placed before certain backgrounds, while signals from stations against an open sky were much easier to recognize. For this reason, the Prussian stations were built on higher ground where necessary. Later, such places were often designated as [...] "Telegrafenberg" [...] as with Glidow (station #5) or station #13 southeast of Biederitz. Because the receipt and distribution of messages was intended only for dispatch stations at the beginning and end of the line, no great value was placed on connecting smaller localities and cities. Frequently, stations were placed away from settled areas. The last station of the first section was constructed on the tower of the Johannis-Kirche in Magdeburg.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT An {{important}} puzzle in {{structural biology}} {{is the question}} of how proteins are able to fold so quickly into their unique native structures. There is much evidence that protein folding is hier-archic. In that case, folding routes are not linear, but have a tree structure. Trees are commonly used to represent the grammatical structure of natural language sentences, and chart parsing algorithms efficiently search the space of all possible trees for a given input string. Here we show that one such method, the CKY algorithm, can be useful both for providing novel insight into the physical protein folding process, and for computational protein structure prediction. As proof of concept, we apply this algorithm to the HP lattice model of proteins. Our algorithm identifies all direct folding <b>route</b> <b>trees</b> to the native state and allows us to construct a simple model of the folding process. Despite its sim-plicity, our model provides an account for the fact that folding rates depend only on the topology of the native state but not on sequence composition. Proteins 2007; 66 : 1 – 15.
