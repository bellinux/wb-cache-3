These differences may {{be a result of}} either anisotropy in the surface lattice (e.g. a <b>rectangular</b> <b>lattice)</b> or the presence of steps on a surface. One of the more dramatic examples of directional anisotropy is the diffusion of adatoms on channeled surfaces such as fcc (110), where diffusion along the channel is much faster than diffusion across the channel.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} Manhattan sampling in two {{and higher}} dimensions, and proves sampling theorems. In two dimensions, Manhattan sampling, which takes samples densely along a Manhattan grid of lines, {{can be viewed as}} sampling on the union of two <b>rectangular</b> <b>lattices,</b> one dense horizontally, being a multiple of the fine spacing of the other. The sampling theorem shows that images bandlimited to the union of the Nyquist regions of the two <b>rectangular</b> <b>lattices</b> can be recovered from their Manhattan samples, and an efficient procedure for doing so is given. Such recovery is possible even though there is overlap among the spectral replicas induced by Manhattan sampling. In three and higher dimensions, there are many possible configurations for Manhattan sampling, each consisting of the union of special <b>rectangular</b> <b>lattices</b> called bi-step lattices. This paper identifies them, proves a sampling theorem showing that images bandlimited to the union of the Nyquist regions of the bi-step <b>rectangular</b> <b>lattices</b> are recoverable from Manhattan samples, and presents an efficient onion-peeling procedure for doing so. Furthermore, it develops a special representation for the bi-step lattices and an algebra with nice properties. It is also shown that the set of reconstructable images is maximal in the Landau sense. While most of the paper deals with continuous-space images, Manhattan sampling of discrete-space images is also considered, for infinite, as well as finite, support images. Comment: 36 page...|$|R

The proposed structures of graphyne are derived from inserting acetylene bonds in place of Carbon-Carbon single bonds in a graphene lattice. Graphyne is theorized to exist in several different geometries. This variety is due to the multiple arrangements of sp and sp2 hybridized carbon. The proposed geometries include a hexagonal lattice structure and a <b>rectangular</b> <b>lattice</b> structure.
