50|$|The {{day before}} Santa Claus {{goes off to}} give {{presents}} out to children around the world, the White Bear says he suspects the Were-Wolf Dog to be around, but Santa tells him not to sit up as he will need energy for the following day. During the night, the Were-Wolf lures the <b>reindeers</b> into coming out of their stable to see the stars by the sea. There, he tricks them into walking on ice floes which go down, and they all die but Dunder. The latter runs to White Bear's to inform him of what happened. The two characters go to the ice hummock to ask the other animals if they can help them carry the presents tomorrow as they have no <b>reindeers</b> left.

5|$|The Inuit of the Thule culture—whose {{descendants}} {{form the}} majority of the current population—arrived nearly a thousand years ago, with the first arrivals dated to approximately 13th and 14th century.

5|$|The Sami peoples {{were subject}} to forced collectivization, {{with more than half}} of their <b>reindeer</b> herds collectivized in 1928–1930. In addition, the {{traditional}} Sami herding practices were phased out in favor of the more economically profitable Komi approach, which emphasized permanent settlements over free herding. Since the Sami culture is strongly tied to the herding practices, this resulted in the Sami people gradually losing their language and traditional herding knowledge. Most Sami were forced to settle in the village of Lovozero, which became the cultural center of the Sami people in Russia. Those Sami resisting the collectivization {{were subject to}} forced labor or death. Various forms of repression against the Sami continued until Stalin's death in 1953. In the 1990s, 40% of the Sami lived in urbanized areas, although some herd <b>reindeer</b> across much of the region.|$|E

5|$|The {{area was}} {{populated}} in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people {{shortly after the}} last glacial period ended about 8000BC. The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century. The Inari Sami originally subsisted on hunting, gathering and especially fishing; later they began to complement this by <b>reindeer</b> husbandry, and later still by farming and herding cattle and sheep. The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages. Until the border was closed in 1852, the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their <b>reindeer.</b> The closing of the border caused some Norwegian Sami to settle {{in the area and}} continue with <b>reindeer</b> husbandry. This caught on among the Inari Sami, and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century. People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark, Norway, to fish during summer. Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century, and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year. Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s, when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway. Previously there were birch forests in the fells, but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the autumnal moth, leaving the fells barren. The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari.|$|E

According to the Swedish Heraldry Society, the <b>reindeer</b> came to represent all lands west of the Gulf of Bothnia at that time, and Västerbotten's coat of arms received its stars in the 1590s. Blazon: Azure, on a semé of stars Or, a <b>reindeer</b> springing argent armed gules. The modern Västerbotten County still bears these arms in the upper portion of a shield divided per fess, with the arms of Lappland and Ångermanland in the base, to illustrate the merging of lands from these two provinces into the modern county.

5|$|In {{the tales}} {{and beliefs of}} the Siberian Yupik people, killer whales are said to appear as wolves in winter, and wolves as killer whales in summer. Killer whales are {{believed}} to assist their hunters in driving walrus. Reverence is expressed in several forms: the boat represents the animal, and a wooden carving hung from the hunter's belt. Small sacrifices such as tobacco are strewn into the sea for them. Killer whales were believed to have helped the hunters even when in wolf guise, by forcing <b>reindeer</b> to {{allow themselves to be}} killed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reindeer</b> herds {{visit the}} grasslands in summer. Other animals include red and Arctic foxes, wolverines, moose, otters, and lynx in the {{southern}} areas. American minks, which were released near the Olenitsa River in 1935–1936, are now common throughout the peninsula and are commercially hunted. Beavers, which became endangered by 1880, were re-introduced in 1934–1957. All in all, thirty-two species of mammals and up to two hundred bird species inhabit the peninsula.|$|E
