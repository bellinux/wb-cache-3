5|$|An {{innovative}} {{drilling and}} blasting technique called Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> process. PCF was chosen over conventional drilling and/or blasting techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels.|$|E

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the Monitoring the Development of the <b>Remedial</b> <b>Work</b> of the Illegal Waste Dump in Bor u Skutče Village. There is an {{evaluation}} of the process of the <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> during the years 2002 and 2008 described in this thesis. First, the introduction focuses on the concepts like landfill and illegal waste dump which have been evaluated primarily by means of legislations. A detailed description of the area of Bor u Skutče village together with the origin of the illegal waste dump and also a characterization of the substances that caused the groundwater contamination follows in the next part. The most important chapter {{deals with the}} evaluation of the data that was obtained through the process of the <b>remedial</b> <b>work,</b> the description of the remedial technologies and the brief description of the company that executed the <b>remedial</b> <b>work.</b> Finally, the last part of this thesis is aimed at monitoring the current situation after the completion of the <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> and the process of removing the <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> in 2013 which was finished after the monitoring that had proved a satisfactory content of the contaminants...|$|R

5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of remedial and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E
25|$|The initial idea, to {{construct}} a new tramway from Grand Lodge to Heaton Hall, was considered too expensive, as it would require <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> to carry it across the railway tunnel. Therefore, a new scheme was proposed {{to open up the}} old Manchester Corporation Tramways spur from Middleton Road to the old tram shelter some 300yards (270m) inside the park.|$|E

25|$|In 1896 it was {{discovered}} that the pier needed urgent <b>remedial</b> <b>works,</b> marine worms having infested the wooden piles. Extensive works were undertaken only for the pier to be damaged again, this time by a heavy storm on 28 November 1896. Further repairs were necessary and the service to Victoria Port became intermittent, closing in the winter months with trains terminating at Sharnal Halt. In 1901 the wooden piles of the pier were encased in concrete in an attempt to prevent further infestation, but problems continued after the area around the pier was dredged, thereby exposing the uncased parts of the piers to investigation.|$|E
25|$|Water {{quality was}} also {{affected}} by four coking plants, at Orgreave, Brookhouse, Avenue and Coalite. Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia {{content and the}} biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146mg/l of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70 per cent lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since. Discharges from Avenue coking plant were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, {{to enable them to}} be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but there were problems with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for some years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> were implemented. The coking plants were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.|$|E

500|$|Extensive <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> were {{undertaken}} between 1999 & 2001 {{to strengthen}} the dam wall. This work involved removing the top [...] of the existing dam wall and drilling/blasting through the dam wall plus up to a further [...] into the bedrock below. The top section of the wall was then rebuilt using reinforced concrete. Finally, permanent, re-stressable ground anchors were then installed through the formed and drilled holes from the crest to be stressed and grouted into the foundation rock. At time of completion, these were the largest capacity and longest permanent ground anchors ever installed in the world.|$|E
500|$|On 2 March 2006, a beam in {{the roof}} of the debating chamber swung loose from its hinges during a debate, {{resulting}} in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business. Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> were carried out. The structural engineers, Arup, stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault. The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project. [...] The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being overtightened or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.|$|E

2500|$|Following a {{decision}} to electrify Taiwan's busy West Coast Main Line, thirteen 5 car electric multiple units based on the Mark 2 design were built by BREL in York for the Taiwan Railway Administration in 1976, but following problems with the electrical equipment and excessive weight could not enter service until 1979 following the completion of <b>remedial</b> <b>works.</b> They used GEC electrical equipment and were built for [...] track gauge. They were used on the Tze-Chiang Limited Express service. They were withdrawn from service in 2009.|$|E
2500|$|During the mid-20th {{century the}} {{majority}} of mines were closed around Chasewater and the area was becoming increasingly used for leisure purpose. In the early 1950s sailing dinghies {{were the first to}} arrive, subsequently speed boats joined them a little further up the shore. By the early 1960s the sailing club moved to its present position and a funfair etc. was set up on the south shore, in 1961 the pier and the castle were built along the south shore. The 1960s saw the final rail traffic passing over the causeway and the final coal barge leaving Anglesey Basin. In 1984 a Chasewater Master Plan and Development Strategy is published which recognised the nature conservation value of Chasewater and the surrounding land. In 1994 Lichfield District Council became responsible for management of Chasewater and the site became a country park in 1998. Continued investment in the nature and leisure value at Chasewater led to the building of the £1.9million Forest of Mercia Innovation Centre in 2000 and the restoration of the Chasewater Railway as a heritage line. Following an inspection in 2006 it was discovered that <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> were needed to the eastern dam. As a result of this the reservoir was drawn down [...] in spring 2010 for works to be complete by spring 2012. In May 2011 Staffordshire County Council took over ownership of the reservoir to ensure completion of the <b>remedial</b> <b>works.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{elevated}} section {{built with}} concrete girders was not built {{to withstand the}} use of road salt in the winter. The salt created corrosion of the steel within the concrete bents (vertical columns and horizontal caps), which expanded and weakened the steel, and caused pieces of concrete to fall off. <b>Remedial</b> <b>work</b> had to be applied starting in the 1990s {{at a cost of}} $8 million per year. The <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> included sealing expansion joints to force the salty water into the drains and extensive patching of the concrete columns. Exposed steel was sand-blasted and repainted.|$|R
50|$|November 1987, during construction, a beam in {{the area}} of the moving walkway {{deflected}} and caused the residential structure above to tilt approximately 2 inches from vertical. The structural engineers reviewed the design in this area and recommended additional columns, stronger beams, and concrete reinforcing be added. This was done. In December 1987, Wesbild/Station Square hired the MSS Group to conduct a review of the engineering design in this area. They made recommendations, including <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> to beams with insufficient capacity, to which Tamm Tacy concurred. Both firms later certified that this <b>remedial</b> <b>work</b> has been completed by the contractor.|$|R
2500|$|The open-cast mining {{moved into}} the fields {{to the west of}} the house and {{continued}} into the early 1950s. [...] The mined areas took many years to return to a natural state; much of the woodland and the formal gardens were not replaced. [...] The current owners of the property allege that mining operations near the house caused substantial structural damage to the building due to subsidence, and lodged a claim in 2012 of £100million for <b>remedial</b> <b>works</b> against the Coal Authority. The claim was heard by the Upper Tribunal (Lands Chamber)in April 2016. In its decision dated 4 October 2016 the Tribunal found that the damage claimed for was not caused by mining subsidence (2016 UKUT 0432 (LC).|$|E
2500|$|Abnormally high {{rainfall}} in August 1604 led to {{a devastating}} flood of Mexico City - one of several inundations from Lake Texcoco which sometimes took years to recede. [...] The city was still virtually an island at this time. [...] Other such inundations occurred in 1555, 1580, 1607 and 1629 resulting in the decision in 1629 (imperfectly implemented) to drain part of the lake. [...] As an emergency measure, Viceroy Juan de Mendoza asked the Franciscan provincial to assign members of his Order to help in various urgent <b>remedial</b> <b>works.</b> [...] Torquemada participated, specifically in {{the reconstruction of the}} calzadas (causeways) of Los Misterios (leading north-east to Guadalupe – works which took five months of continuous activity to complete, employing thousands of labourers) and of that leading west to Chapultepec. [...] When these works were finished, the friars organised the cleaning of the main drains of the city. [...] It was only through the friars' petitioning the Viceroy that he ordered the labourers to be paid and fed at government expense.|$|E
