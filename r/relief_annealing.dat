40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an effect of}} stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing,</b> applied to casts after the repair by welding, on the microstructure and mechanical properties of quenched and tempered martensitic GX 12 CrMoVNbN 9 – 1 cast steel (called GP 91). The test pieces being the subject of research were taken out from a test coupon. Heat treatment of GP 91 cast steel was carried out at the parameters of temperature and time appropriate {{for the treatment of}} multi-ton steel casts, while stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> was performed at the temperatures of 730 and 750 oC. After quenching and tempering GP 91 cast steel was characterized by the microstructure of high-tempered martensite with numerousprecipitations of carbides of diverse size. Mechanical properties of the investigated cast steel after heat treatment fulfilled the standard requirements. Stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> contributes to the processes of recovery and recrystallization of the matrix as well as the privileged precipitation of M 23 C 6 carbides on grain boundaries. Changes in the microstructure of the examined cast steel cause deterioration in mechanical properties – the higher the temperature of stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing,</b> the greater the deterioration...|$|E
40|$|The fatigue {{performances}} of self-piercing riveting (SPR) joints connecting similar and dissimilar sheets of TA 1 titanium alloy (TA 1), Al 5052 aluminium alloy (Al 5052) and H 62 copper alloy (H 62) were studied in this paper. The specimens of similar TA 1 sheets treated with stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> {{were prepared to}} investigate the influence of <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> on the mechanical properties of SPR joints. Fatigue tests were conducted to characterize the fatigue lives and failure modes of the joints. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was employed to determine the fatigue failure mechanisms of the joints. The results showed that stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> has an apparent impact on the fatigue performances but has little influence on the static strengths of the joints. For SPR joints in similar or dissimilar sheets, joints between similar TA 1 sheets possess the best fatigue resistance, which are {{significantly higher than the}} joints in dissimilar sheets. In addition, most of the joints failed in the rivet and the locked sheet through fatigue tests, except the joints between TA 1 and Al 5052, which failed only in the locked sheets...|$|E
40|$|Advanced {{manufacturing}} approaches, including {{additive manufacturing}} (i. e., “ 3 D printing”) of metallic structures requires a change to qualification strategies. One approach, informed qualification, integrates modeling strategies to make predictions of material characteristics, including {{the prediction of}} tensile properties for given chemistries and microstructures. In this work, constitutive equations are developed and presented that can predict the yield strength of additively manufactured Ti- 6 Al- 4 V subjected {{to one of three}} different heat-treatments: a stress <b>relief</b> <b>anneal</b> in the α+β phase field; a hot isostatic press treatment in the α+β phase field; and a β-anneal. The equations are nominally identical, though different strengthening mechanisms are active according to subtle microstructural differences. To achieve an equation that can predict the yield strength of the material, it is also necessary to include an assessment of dramatic reduction in the tensile strength due to texture (i. e., a “knock-down” effect). This has been experimentally measured, and included in this paper. The resulting predictions of yield strength are generally within 5 % of their experimentally measured values...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{residual}} stresses on the fatigue behavior of Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples that had undergone {{foreign object damage}} was investigated. Real and simulated impacts were conducted using spherical projectiles launched at 300 m/s and quasi-static chisel indentation, respectively. A unique test specimen configuration that replicates {{the leading edge of}} a typical fan blade was ballistically shot at 30 ° with 1 mm diameter spheres, while rectangular plates were indented quasi-statically using a 2 mm diameter steel indentor at 0 °. Fatigue strengths were developed for both geometries at 350 Hz. A number of specimens from both configurations were stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealed,</b> after impacting and before HCF testing, to remove residual stresses. Attempts were made to correlate the measured damage (macro-/microscopic) to the debit in fatigue strength. Results indicate that stress relief generally improves the fatigue limit stress, indicating that tensile stresses are present after both quasi-static and dynamic indentation. For the dynamic impacts, the damage induced is not as severe on the fatigue strengths as that predicted from conventional notch fatigue analysis...|$|R

Based on the experimental results {{in which the}} creep strain rate is highest for stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealed</b> cladding (SRA) and lowest for recrystallized cladding (RXA), the annealing factor was introduced and derived by iterative calculations until the best predictions for all the rods were obtained. The creep model has been incorporated into the KAERIs fuel performance code COSMOS and then verified with 4 cladding creep data, of which 3 cases exhibit creepdown {{and the other one}} creepout. The model predicts well the creep behavior of UO 2 fuel rods in PWRs. The prediction does not show any discernable difference between the high- and low-Sn claddings. With satisfactory agreement between predicted and measured values, the comparison indicates no difference in creep behavior between MOX and UO 2 fuel rods as expected.

Eight iron-based materials were tested: 3 ledeburitic cast steels, 2 hypereutectoid cast steels, normalized and stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealed</b> steel, hardened and tempered steel and nodular mottled cast iron. Design/methodology/approach: The exploitation tests were performed on the hot rolling mills for selected rolled sections, rolling stands and roll passes. The samples were cut out of the roll in such a way that they contained the roll working surface and were used for metallographic observations of the subsurface zone. Findings: It was found, that uniform distribution of dispersed precipitates of hypereutectoid cementite in the alloy matrix prevents the formation of the white layer {{on the surface of the}} rolls. Research limitations/implications: The white layer definition was given. An influence of the microstructure of iron base alloys on the susceptibility to form the white layer on their surface due to tribological contact was also determined.

Moreover, the influence of stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> at the temperatures of 730 and 750 oC on microstructure and properties has been investigated. Design/methodology/approach: Microstructure of the cast steel was characterized using optical metallography and transmission electron microscopy. Identification of precipitates was made by means of thin foils and extraction carbon replicas. The size of precipitations was determined by Image Pro Plus software. Moreover, the mechanical properties (static tension, hardness and impact energy) have been tested. Findings: What has been determined is the influence of heat treatment parameters on microstructure and mechanical properties of GP 91 cast steel. Heat treatment (hardening and high-temperature tempering) of GP 91 cast steel allowed to obtain a fine-grained microstructure of high-tempered martensite with numerous precipitates whose properties met the standard requirements, regardless of the heat treatment parameters.

Verificou-se através de ensaios de impacto Charpy-V que o TTAT, promoveu um ganho de tenacidade e resistência para teores de Mn entre 0, 9 % - 1, 1 %, enquanto que a aplicação do TTSC não promoveu mudanças significativas na tenacidade para todos os teores estudados.

The welded joints were subjected to three types of heat treatment; either stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing,</b> or step cooling or stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> and step cooling.

Laser processing parameters investigated include laser power (2 – 4 kW), welding speed (0. 75 – 7. 5 m/min), joint gap (0 – 0. 6 mm) and defocusing distance (- 1 mm and - 2 mm). Two post-weld heat treatments (i. e. stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing,</b> solution treatment and aging) are investigated and compared with the as-welded condition. Although some welding defects such as underfill and porosity have been observed, high quality welds can be obtained using a high power Nd:YAG laser. Underfill defect is found to increase but the porosity area decreases with increasing welding speed. The use of the filler wire decreases the underfill defect. However, the porosity area increases with increasing joint gap. The hardness is maximum in the fusion zone (FZ) followed by a sharp decrease in the heat affected zone (HAZ) to the base metal (BM). The low temperature annealing process increases the hardness of the fusion zone but the combination of the high temperature solution treatment followed by aging decreases the fusion zone hardness almost to the base metal values. Tensile testing shows that the joint efficiency varies between 95 and 105 %. The porosity and underfill are the two main defects for failure in the FZ and HAZ, respectively.

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) {{is one of the}} AM processes that generates metallic components layer by layer using powder-bed technique. The irradiation and consequent melting of metallic powder is realised by the laser source. Employing SLM, especially complex and individual products, such as implants or aerospace parts, are well suited for economic production in small batches. The first important issue in this work was to analyse the fatigue crack growth (FCG) in titanium alloy Ti- 6 - 4 and stainless steel 316 L processed by SLM. As a first step, stress intensity range decreasing tests were performed on SLM samples in their “as-built” condition. The next step was to adopt measures for optimisation of fatigue crack growth performance of SLM parts. For this purpose various heat treatments such as stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> and hot isostatic pressing (HIP) were applied to the CT specimens. Finally, the strong impact of heat treatment on the residual lifetime was demonstrated by numerical fatigue crack growth simulations. For this purpose, the hip joint implant consisting of Ti- 6 - 4 and processed by SLM was taken into account. It was found that residual stresses have a strong influence on the crack growth in Ti- 6 - 4, while the influence of the micro-pores on the threshold values remains low. In contrast the results for 316 L show that its fracturemechanical behaviour is not affected by residual stresses, whereas the microstructural features lead to modification in the da/dN-K-data. The second fundamental aim of this work was to demonstrate the possibilities of the SLM process. For that reason, the individually tailored bicycle crank was optimised regarding its weight and local stresses and finally manufactured using the SLM system.

Direct current potential difference (DCPD) is used to detect crack initiation. Surface crack measurements are made using a scanning electron microscope prior to HCF testing. Heat tinting prior to HCF testing is used to mark the crack front to allow for post fracture crack measurements. HCF thresholds at R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 are determined for each specimen using step loading at room temperature and 600 Hz. Additionally, the HCF threshold is measured at R = 0. 1 for specimens with small cracks that have been stress relief annealed to eliminate residual stresses and load history. Long crack thresholds are determined using a similar step loading procedure at R = 0. 1 and R = 0. 5 for specimens which have been precracked using a range of Kmax. Long crack threshold measurements are also determined for specimens which have been precracked using a range of Kmax, but stress relief annealed prior to testing. Comparisons show that HCF threshold measurements, when naturally initiated small cracks are present, are dependent on the load histories that are used to initiate the cracks. Further comparisons show that the measured small crack thresholds follow similar trends for load history effects which occur in the long crack threshold data. Additionally, it is found that thresholds can be measured free of load history effects by using a stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing</b> process after the precracking and prior to the threshold testing. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering. Johannesburg, May 2014 Race vehicles depend mainly on passive safety systems, such as the steel collapsible steering column investigated in this report. There is no existing literature that investigates alternate impact testing methods that meet the F ed eration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) requirements. In this study, the steering columns were statically crushed to determine the e ect of residual stresses. The steering columns were observed to collapse on themselves, as the top surface deformed, the 90 bends unfolded, and the 50 bends folded further on the side supports. The reduced residual stresses in the 90 bends after stress <b>relief</b> <b>annealing,</b> resulted in a strengthening e ect and therefore a larger bending moment was required to unfold the bend. The residual stresses did not greatly a ect the overall strength and energy absorption characteristics of the steering column, because the deformation of the 90 bends only contributed a small percentage towards the energy absorption ability of the steering column. In conclusion, zero residual stresses in cold bent steel plates are desired if the plate is being unfolded as the steering column collapses, however residual stresses can be useful if the plate is being bent further. The quasi-static approximation {{has been reported to}} be suitable if the impact mass is much larger than the impact structure. The quasi-static approximation was used to calculate the acceleration-time history of each tested specimen from the static compression tests. Numerical simulation of the steering column impact test illustrated that the impact mass and steering column experienced a series of high frequency collisions. This phenomenon was due to the momentum transfer between the impact mass and steering column, i. e. the steering column locally accelerated away from the impact mass, it then slowed down as the energy was absorbed which allowed the impact mass to again collide with the steering column. The numerical simulation and experimental results showed good correlation after having been digitally ltered using a low pass digital lter with a cuto frequency of 1000 Hz as per Le Mans regulations. The quasi-static approximation was found to give excellent agreement with the digitally ltered results, however due to its nature it could not replicate the high speed oscillatory behaviour. In conclusion, the steering column under investigation was found to be inertia sensitive, and the quasi-static approximation may only be used to evaluate the energy absorption characteristics of the steering column on its own according to the FIA requirements...|$|E
