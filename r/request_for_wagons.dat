Main object of my work is concrete propose of brake with blocks and reason, why is this brake use on most of wagons. Next I describe <b>requests</b> <b>for</b> brake accessories <b>for</b> freight <b>wagons,</b> mainly <b>for</b> operation in SS mode. At second part is proposal for brake <b>for</b> freight <b>wagon</b> type TAGNPPS <b>for</b> operating in SS mode. Scheme of mechanical and pneumatic part, CAD model of this brake system, voltage analyses by FEM method of choosing component â€“ brake lever, created in SolidWorks 2011 mode. For compare of result by FEM method is used analytic count of this component...|$|R
