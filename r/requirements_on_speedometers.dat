Soon this narrowed down to nothing but [...] "ornamentation," [...] in which he was obliged to spend all his time designing nameplates, lettering, and the configuration of numerals <b>on</b> <b>speedometers,</b> tachometers, and other instruments, all extremely tedious work. But he stuck with it for seven and a half years, exclaiming later that he didn't know how he managed to do it for so long.|$|R

It utilized shapes based on subtly curved rectangles with rounded corners, reflecting the modern designs that were gaining popularity at the time, influenced by the subtly curved shape of a cathode ray tube screen or airplane windows. It became very popular as a typeface that evokes technology (it can be seen <b>on</b> the <b>speedometers</b> <b>on</b> many cars and vehicles, particularly older models). This was an expansion and development of the earlier design Microgramma typeface (designed in a project led by Alessandro Butti), an all-caps design.|$|R

England accepted refugees from the Baltic States on condition they work a minimum of three years as manual labourers in factories, workshops, hospitals, mines and farms. On his arrival in England, Mazitis started to establish himself in the artistic life of his new home country. In 1950, a portrait of his oldest daughter Ieva, Girl with a Beret, was accepted at the Royal Academy of Arts for its summer exhibition and the portrait was shown in London as well as in Brighton. He joined Smiths Industries in 1954 as a freehand designer, working <b>on</b> <b>speedometers</b> for Rolls Royce and Jaguar cars.|$|R

The Sport Instrumentation Group also included the optional tachometer in the center of the cluster, as well as oil and ammeter gauges. In 1984, the body moulding and interior trim were updated. In 1985-1986 models, the upper accent mouldings were moved below the front marker. For 1985, the rear tailgate moulding on XLT models was updated and previewed the design of the 1987 model. This molding has become increasingly rare and fetches a high price. A cargo light was available as an option and was included in the Light Group option package.

40|$|Scalable Reliable Multicast Protocols {{that reduce}} {{processing}} <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> receivers and senders {{have been the}} subject of much research in recent years. In [12] and [6] we propose a new protocol that groups receivers for error recovery into fixed-size groups, thus reducing their processing requirement to O(1). We expand on this work by applying the concept of Local Recovery to receiver groups, which further improves the processing <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> the sender while maintaining a constant O(1) <b>requirement</b> <b>on</b> the receivers. Furthermore, we extrapolate the concept of receiver grouping to repair servers resulting in further reduction in the sender’s processing requirements.

40|$|This paper uses a {{case study}} to {{evaluate}} empirically three formalisms of different kinds for their suitability for the modelling and analysis of dynamic reconfiguration of dependable systems. The <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> an ideal formalism for dynamic software reconfiguration are defined. The reconfiguration of an office workflow for order processing is described, and the <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> the reconfiguration of the workflow are defined. The workflow is modelled using the Vienna Development Method (VDM), conditional partial order graphs (CPOGs), and the basic Calculus of Communicating Systems for dynamic process reconfiguration (basic CCS^dp), and verification of the reconfiguration requirements is attempted using the models. The formalisms are evaluated according {{to their ability to}} model the reconfiguration of the workflow, to verify the <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> the workflow's reconfiguration, and to meet the <b>requirements</b> <b>on</b> an ideal formalism.
