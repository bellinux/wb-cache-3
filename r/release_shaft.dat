5000|$|The third blaxploitation film <b>released,</b> <b>Shaft</b> {{is one of}} {{the best}} and most popular films of the genre. Commenting on the film shortly after its release, New York Times movie critic Vincent Canby {{accurately}} predicted the wave of blaxploitation films to follow: [...] "How audiences react, however, has a great deal to do with the kind of movies that do get made, and having watched the extraordinary receptions given to both Sweet Sweetback and Shaft I'm led to wonder if, perhaps, the existence of what seems to be a large, hungry, black movie audience—an audience whose experiences and interests are treated mostly in token fashion by TV—might not be one of the more healthy and exciting developments on the current movie scene." [...] Shaft greatly impacted future blaxploitation films which [...] "crudely tried to emulate the success of Shaft and Sweetback, repeated, filled in, or exaggerated the ingredients of the Blaxploitation formula, which usually consisted of a pimp, gangster, or their baleful female counterparts, violently acting out a revenge or retribution motif against corrupt whites in the romanticized confines of the ghetto or inner city." ...|$|R

50|$|Dando Shaft is {{the name}} of a {{short-lived}} psychedelic/progressive folk and folk jazz band that was primarily active in the early 1970s.

That Monday, too, it will be remembered, dawned in storm, the sleet hissing in the wide throats of the centre-chimneys, and bearing down great boughs of trees until they broke in agony. Dusk came early, and howling darkness that hid a muffled figure on the ice-bound road staring at the yellow cracks in the tannery door. Presently the figure crossed the yard; the door, flying open, <b>released</b> a <b>shaft</b> of light that shot across the white ground, revealed a face beneath a hood to him who stood within.|$|R

5|$|The {{vertical}} {{line on the}} sight was relatively short, {{and could not be}} used directly to measure drift – unlike the long drift wires of the CSBS it replaced. To address this, the collimator handle could be used to manually rotate the sighting assembly forward, allowing the bomb aimer to point the sight further in front of the aircraft's location. This allowed the bomb aimer to select any convenient object on the ground for drift measurements, including the target itself, long before the aircraft reached it. Through periodic movements of the handle, the bomb aimer could ensure the drift line continued to pass through the target. When the handle was returned to the resting position and <b>released,</b> the <b>shaft</b> to the computor automatically re-engaged and started tracking the proper range angle again. The handle was also used to rotate the collimator forward for storage.|$|R

50|$|In the 1950s, {{fountain}} pens with cylindrical points became available, {{but they were}} complex instruments with tubes holding a tiny <b>shaft.</b> To <b>release</b> ink the <b>shaft</b> is depressed and a line of about {{the width of the}} exterior diameter of the tube can be drawn. Additionally, in later models, the tube had a small ledge that effectively narrowed its end, that—while maintaining the line thickness—made the tube thicker along most of its length and also protected ink from spilling while drawing along the edge of a rule, set-square, T-square or other template (the ink had no immediate contact with the template's edge). Some special, more expensive nibs were equipped with tubes made of tungsten or with their tips made of synthetic precious stones, to slow their wear on hard surfaces.|$|R

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} the skill {{component of the}} wrist release in the golf swing by employing a three-dimensional dynamic model considering vibration of the club shaft. It is observed that professional and expert golfers relax their wrists in the swing motion as a "natural" or "late" release. Thus, {{the relationship between the}} timing of the wrist <b>release</b> and the <b>shaft</b> vibration is examined in this study. First, it is demonstrated that "natural release" at the zero-crossing point of the bending vibration of the shaft efficiently increases the head speed at impact. In the next step, the "late hitting" condition is imposed upon the model. It is demonstrated that "late hitting" could further improve the efficiency of the swing motion. Finally, the skill component in the wrist release for the long drive is experimentally verified by measuring the movement of the wrist and the dynamic deformation of the shaft during the downswing...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe 1 / 15 reduced-scale {{experiments}} were conducted using the Froude number conservation to investigate smoke diffusion characteristics in tunnel fires with natural ventilation. The effects of some factors such as: heat <b>release</b> rate, <b>shaft</b> distance, shaft size, train blockage and smoke curtain were studied. A porous bed propane burner, {{placed on the}} tunnel floor, was used to simulate the fire source. A series of K- type thermocouples were used to measure tunnel ceiling smoke temperatures. A hotwire anemometer {{was used to measure}} smoke volume rate and smoke temperature in the ventilation shaft. The experimental results indicated that all factors, except for the smoke curtain, have no major effect on the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the fire section of the tunnel. Moreover, the fire size and train blockage do not {{have a significant effect on}} the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the non-fire section of the tunnel. Nevertheless, the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the non-fire section of the tunnel decreased with the decrease of the shaft distance and the increase of the shaft size. When the smoke curtain is used in the tunnel, the dimensionless ceiling temperatures in the fire channel are higher than in the case when the smoke curtain is not used. Moreover, there is no smoke in the evacuation channel. The fire size and train blockage do not have a considerable effect on the dimensionless temperatures and smoke volume rates in the shaft. Nonetheless, the dimensionless smoke temperatures in the shaft decrease with the increase in the shaft distance or the shaft size.
