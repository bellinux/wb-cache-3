5|$|At Quantico, someone slips a {{newspaper}} article under Scully's door enabling her to identify the original body as a crew member on a Russian ship. Mulder and Scully meet at the processing plant and {{they look at the}} strange, fluke-like man. Skinner wants to prosecute the creature and subject it to a psychiatric evaluation, which Mulder thinks would be difficult. Skinner tells Mulder of Craig's death and admits that this would have been an X-File had they still been open. Mulder <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> discontentment claiming that with X-Files, a certain pair of agents could have saved a life. Skinner simply responds saying everyone takes their orders from someone, implying the decision was not his and came from higher up the chain of command.|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} Miss Todd, and he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> eyes, and he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hands, but the courage {{was not in}} him to speak. There was about Miss Todd as she stood, or as she sat, a {{firmness}} which showed itself even in her rotundity, a vigour in the very rubicundity of her cheek which was apt to quell the spirit {{of those who would}} fain have interfered with her. So Mr. O'Callaghan, having <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> eyes considerably, and having <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hands a little, said nothing.|$|R
60|$|The next word failed on <b>his</b> lips; he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hand in {{the dead}} silence. With eyes that opened wide in horror, he <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hand and pointed over Miss Garth's shoulder.|$|R

5|$|Both sexes reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{one year of}} age. The male mates with the female by swimming close to her with his head lowered and tail raised, continually whistling. If there {{is a group of}} males, they will chase the female in flight until only one drake is left. The female prepares for copulation, which takes place in the water, by lowering her body; the male then bobs his head up and down and mounts the female, taking the feathers {{on the back of her}} head in his mouth. After mating, he <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> head and back and whistles.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division {{arrive with}} {{infantry}} and armor. Although they inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, {{most of the}} paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish, and Horvath are killed, while Upham avoids fighting. Miller attempts to blow the bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham confronts Steamboat Willie and his group {{as they attempt to}} retreat. Steamboat Willie <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.|$|E
5|$|Tuatara {{reproduce}} very slowly, taking 10 to 20 {{years to}} reach sexual maturity. Mating occurs in midsummer; females mate and lay eggs once every four years. During courtship, a male makes his skin darker, <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> crests, and parades toward the female. He slowly walks in circles around the female with stiffened legs. The female will either submit, and allow the male to mount her, or retreat to her burrow. Males {{do not have a}} penis; they reproduce by the male lifting the tail of the female and placing his vent over hers. The sperm is then transferred into the female, much like the mating process in birds.|$|E

5|$|Mandodari is {{described}} as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita. When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of a woman is a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini.|$|E

Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's cell phone. Krycek aims his gun at Mulder and tells him to get out.

The pursuit ends up in the FBI garage and ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car into the garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead.|$|E

He immediately runs into her on the street as she is running for her bus and he is off to meet Madame X. They agree to meet again, but Marie fails to appear and he returns home to find Madame X waiting for him against their agreement, so he <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> price tenfold.

5|$|The next morning, Herod sees Cort's busted {{hand and}} gives Ratsy twenty seconds to leave town. He offers to face Cort left-handed, which Herod is equally fast at drawing with. Herod kills Ratsy {{with a rifle}} and then squares off to fight Cort. Herod then {{secretly}} tells his guards to kill Cort if he is the winner. At the moment Herod draws, several buildings explode on the street. Herod's house and the clock tower are also blown up, and through the smoke and flames, Ellen walks back into town, having faked her death {{with the help of}} Cort, Doc Wallace, the Blind Boy, and the Kid's stash of dynamite.

5|$|The {{rear face}} is plainer, with no jewels, but still highly decorated; Cherry speculates {{that it may}} {{originally}} {{have been much more}} simple and not designed for viewing, with most of the other elements added after it was originally made. At the top is a medallion with the face of Christ set in a sunburst. The central round-topped area contains two doors, secured with a small gold pin, containing full-length gold figures in relief, chased in gold, a feature unique to this reliquary. On the left door is the archangel Saint Michael, spearing a dragon representing the devil. He was both the patron saint of the French monarchy, and also traditionally the person responsible for supervising the chaotic crowds at the Last Judgement, when he is often shown in art weighing souls in a pair of scales. On the right is Saint Christopher, carrying the Christ child on his shoulders, who <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> hand in blessing. There was a popular belief that sight of an image of Saint Christopher meant that a person would not die on that day without receiving the Last Rites, which may well explain his presence here.|$|E

50|$|Raising one's hands is an {{encouraged}} option. There {{are many}} hadith that describe how Muhammad <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hands during du'a. Some hadith describe him having <b>raised</b> <b>his</b> hands way up high in emergency situations. Many scholars agree {{that if it}} is not an extreme situation that Muhammad did not <b>raise</b> <b>his</b> hands above his head. The exact manner that many scholars in Islam describe how high the hands should be raised during a regular Du'a is up to the shoulders with palms placed together.|$|R
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man <b>raises</b> <b>his</b> bid and becomes the highest bidder for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
