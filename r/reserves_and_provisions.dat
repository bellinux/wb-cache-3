40|$|International audienceFrom {{a sample}} of Islamic banks around the world from 1997 to 2012, this paper {{examines}} whether loan loss provisioning in Islamic banks is procyclical. Our empirical findings highlight that loan loss provisioning in Islamic banks remains procyclical, although the " expected " loan loss model (E-LLM) has been implemented for Islamic banks in several countries. A closer investigation further documents that Islamic banks also use loan loss provisions for discretionary managerial actions, especially related to capital management in which loan loss <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions</b> are inflated when bank capitalization declines. Eventually, this paper highlights that higher capitalization can mitigate the procyclicality of loan loss provisions in Islamic banks. In other words, loan loss provisioning becomes countercyclical for Islamic banks with higher capitalization. This paper therefore casts doubts on {{the adoption of the}} E-LLM for Islamic banks to promote countercyclical effects, because the E-LLM may be influenced by managerial discretion, including opportunistic capital management using loan loss provisions that may undermine the importance of maintaining sufficient bank capitalization...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{the article}} is to analyse {{concepts}} of reserves in traditional accounting models and the characteristics  of the area of reserves in contemporary global accounting standards.   Concepts of reserves in different countries are {{deeply rooted in the}} socio-economic environment of accounting. The differences in the significance, role and the scale of creation of reserves are especially evident in the Anglo-Saxon and continental accounting Reserves play a very important role in the accounting system of IFRSs– they provide a specific control mechanism which enables companies to verify economic benefits embodied in their net assets. The analysis of the IFRSs rules concerning the creation of valuation <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions</b> may lead to the conclusion that they are- above all – subject to true and fair view concept.

40|$|The {{financial}} statements represent a comprehensive and standardized document including financial {{information about the}} company. The companies need to publish this document in the Collection of Deeds, and since the documents are submitted to the Collection of Deeds in electronic form and are subsequently freely available, any {{financial statements}} are generally available {{to a wide range}} of potential users. Users of the financial statements can be divided based on their relation to the financial statements and based on level of their knowledge of accounting. The confidence of users in information disclosed in the financial statements is higher, in case the financial statements were subject to audit. The user of the financial statements does not have a possibility of detailed verification of the information presented in it (he cannot inquire the management of the company, inspect the original accounting documents, etc.). In this case, the audit represents ensuring correctness of the information presented in the financial statements and also assurance that the financial statements were subject to the independent verification. These facts enhance the degree of confidence of intended users in the financial statements and this is also the purpose of an audit as defined by the International Standards on Auditing. In accordance with the International Standards on Auditing the auditor expects that the user of the financial statements has reasonable knowledge of accounting and is willing to study the financial statements with reasonable effort. Auditor performs his testing based on certain materiality level that does not have to agree to the materiality level of the user. The risk represents in this case the situation, when the materiality level of the user is lower than the materiality level determined by the auditor. The user of the financial statements has limited possibilities to verify the information in it, however, he is able to verify the link among information presented in different parts of the financial statements and confront the financial statements with other relevant information available. My dissertation consists from theoretical and practical part. In the theoretical part, there are possible verifications described that can be performed by the user of the financial statements and in the practical part, there are the mentioned procedures applied to financial statements of four domestic companies. The subject of my research was financial statements for the years 2006 to 2009. The aim was not only the identification of the risks in the financial statements from the users' point of view, but also monitoring of the development of financial statements in time. The subject of the dissertation was also the verification of the formal correctness of audit reports issued to the selected financial statements (I am registered as Czech statutory auditor by the Chamber of Auditors of the Czech Republic and therefore I am able to perform this verification). The subject of the dissertation was not the verification of the factual correctness of the audit report, this verification is in principle not possible without possibility to look into the audit file. During analysis of selected financial statements I have identified several areas that represent risk of misstatement in the financial statements from the users' point of view. It related mainly to going concern issues, issues relating to completeness of <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisions</b> and risk of possible overvaluation of finance investments and related receivables to subsidiaries. The user of the financial statements should for his better understanding therefore look for other information relating to the company from freely available resources and perform comparison with financial statements of other companies in the same industry. The risks mentioned above were not sufficiently commented in the notes to the financial statements and that subsequently gives a rise to questions on financial statements users' side and lowers his confidence in information presented in the financial statements. I think that there is a change in the audit approach necessary, it should not be enough just that the financial statements are free from material misstatement; the financial statements should not give a rise to additional questions from their users...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} seven Chinese pilot carbon schemes {{that will be}} {{implemented}} in late 2013, and relates the most critical and relevant lessons from the European Union’s Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS) to the Chinese circumstances. This paper reviews the key policy designs of the pilot schemes, and discusses the unique Chinese policies and market environment that would differentiate the Chinese schemes from the EU ETS. In terms of expected emission abatement, this paper estimates that, compared to business as usual (BAU) level, Guangdong, Hubei and Shanghai are expected to mitigate the highest amount of CO 2 emissions. In terms of carbon price, this paper expects the schemes of Guangdong and Hubei to have the highest carbon price while the price in Beijing and Tianjin will be the lowest. By reviewing EU’s experience, this paper proposes recommendations on 1) avoiding allowances over-­‐supply and windfall profits, 2) maintaining market stability, 3) bottom-­‐level allocation, 4) use of allowance <b>reserve</b> <b>and</b> <b>provision,</b> <b>and</b> 5) sector selection and allocation.

40|$|Issues and {{developments}} in loan loss provisioning: {{the case of}} Asia 1 In {{the aftermath of the}} Asian financial crisis of the late 1990 s, many jurisdictions in Asia strengthened their approaches to loan loss provisioning, including the adoption of discretionary measures. This has contributed to stronger banking systems in the region. JEL classification: G 21, G 28. Loan loss provisions 2 have traditionally been backward-looking and highly procyclical. That is, they have tended to be low ahead of banking crises, and to rise sharply as losses mount. In response to the latest crisis, national and international authorities are considering measures to promote more forwardlooking provisioning practices that would result in banks entering periods characterised by a deterioration in credit quality with higher levels of reserves. As loan losses materialise, the already higher level of reserves would reduce the downward pressure on bank earnings and capital that would otherwise occur. Provisioning practices in Asia may provide useful lessons. Since the late 1990 s, spurred by the severe losses of the Asian financial crisis, most jurisdictions in Asia have adopted more conservative loan loss provisioning standards. Some have implemented measures designed to secure larger provisions during times of economic and credit growth. As a result, loan loss <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> <b>provisioning</b> expense levels were generally higher leading into the current financial crisis than they were before the Asian crisis. From a global perspective, they were also higher than those of many countries outside Asia that were significantly affected by the crisis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{risk and}} profitability {{issues in the}} future British electricity industry through three different studies. The first study develops a novel and fully endogenous portfolio investment model for firms in a competitive electricity industry when they face uncertainties from fuel prices, demand levels, carbon price and renewable penetration. This study finds that both risk aversion and carbon price are crucial factors for investments in nuclear technology. The second study analyses {{the impact of the}} cost of capital on optimal investments. Two distinct costs of capital of a project are considered: one in the pre-development and construction (pre-operation) phase and the other in the operation phase. The pre-operation cost of capital is based on the complex and capital-intensive nature of a project, which prevents potential investors from undertaking them under high costs – this is the first driving force for investment followed by the operation cost of capital. Operation cost of capital is based on a company’s ability to generate cash flows that cover debt requirements by varying the debt-equity ratio that a firm can attain. The greater the cash-flow risk, the lower is the level of debt that the firm can include in its financing, and hence, the higher the weighted average cost of capital, given that debt generally benefits from tax shield. The third study analyses the profit risk of energy storage when it faces fuel-price risk. Specifically, it assesses the future electricity industry with different levels of renewable penetration and storage energy capacity. The study shows that energy storage profits depend on the electricity price risk when it makes profits from arbitrage <b>and</b> <b>reserve</b> <b>provision</b> <b>and</b> also shows that storage profit has a positive correlation with that of other generators, especially with profits of gas stations, and this correlation is moderated with the level of electricity demand.

40|$|Few {{works were}} {{interested}} in the procyclical character of the provisioning policy. However, the accounting practices as regards provisioning of the loans losses adopted by banks fluctuate with the business cycle and can reinforce financial instability. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine whether and to what extent provisioning policy are procyclical. We focus on the interaction between business cycle <b>and</b> <b>provisioning</b> policy (loan loss <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> loan loss <b>provisions)</b> consistent with the Basel Accord of 1988 which made loan loss reserves no longer part of Tier I capital in the numerator of the capital adequacy ratio. An empirical model on panel data is then adapted on European banks from 1992 to 2004. In this model we consider two types of provisioning policy determinants: loan loss <b>provisions</b> <b>and</b> loan loss <b>reserves.</b> We identify banks with different strategies and different characteristics based on the ratio of non interest income in total revenue. We find that large banks tend to hold less risk. They establish fewer reserves than small banks. However, our results provide that functional diversification have no impact on provisioning policy. We also find that risk weighted assets reduce the volatility of the provisioning policy (loan loss <b>provisions</b> <b>and</b> loan loss <b>reserves)</b> during the cycle. The findings of our research are consistent with the empirical work of Bikker and Hu (2002), Laeven and Majnoni (2003), of Bikker and Metzemakers (2005) who show that banks more fund loans losses in period of economic downturn than in period of economic upturn for a whole of the OECD countries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Introduction Primitively eusocial halictid {{bees are}} {{excellent}} systems {{to study the}} origin of eusociality, because all individuals have retained the ancestral ability to breed independently. In the sweat bee Halictus scabiosae, foundresses overwinter, establish nests and rear a first brood by mass-provisioning each offspring with pollen and nectar. The mothers may thus manipulate the phenotype of their offspring by restricting their food provisions. The first brood females generally help their mother to rear a second brood of males and gynes that become foundresses. However, the first brood females may also reproduce in their maternal or in other nests, or possibly enter early diapause. Here, we examined if the behavioural specialization {{of the first and}} second brood females was associated with between-brood differences in body size, energetic <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> pollen <b>provisions.</b> Results The patterns of variation in adult body size, weight, fat content <b>and</b> food <b>provisioned</b> to the first and second brood indicate that H. scabiosae has dimorphic females. The first-brood females were significantly smaller, lighter and had lower fat reserves than the second-brood females and foundresses. The first-brood females were also less variable in size and fat content, and developed on homogeneously smaller pollen provisions. Foundresses were larger than gynes of the previous year, suggesting that small females were less likely to survive the winter. Conclusions The marked size dimorphism between females produced in the first and second brood and the consistently smaller pollen provisions provided to the first brood suggest that the first brood females are channelled into a helper role during their pre-imaginal development. As a large body size is needed for successful hibernation, the mother may promote helping in her first brood offspring by restricting their food provisions. This pattern supports the hypothesis that parental manipulation may contribute to promote worker behaviour in primitively eusocial halictids. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{economic}} implications of different contract durations in markets for on-line (primary <b>and</b> secondary) <b>reserve</b> capacity in Germany with the crucial feature of separate markets for spot energy <b>and</b> <b>reserve</b> capacity <b>provision.</b> The analysis {{is based on}} an equilibrium model developed by Just and Weber (2008) for reserve markets. It reveals the implicit trade-off for the bidders and interdependencies between the <b>reserve</b> <b>and</b> the spot markets. The results clearly show that shorter periods (with resulting lower variations in overall electricity demand) lead to more efficient dispatch and market results. Not only prices in the reserve capacity markets are expected to be lower, but also spot market prices. As these benefits can be partially reaped by owners of large generation portfolios also under longer contract durations, it discriminates smaller generation companies and can potentially deter market participation. Further, the paper discusses security concerns against shorter contract durations. It is shown that the opportunity costs character of the reserve market implies sufficient incentives for supplying online reserve capacity.

40|$|A {{large number}} of die-off of {{globally}} threatened Arabian Oryx (Oryx leucoryx), and Arabian Sand Gazelle (Gazella subgutturosa marica) were recorded from 1999 to 2008 in fenced Mahazat as-Sayd Protected Area (PA) in western-central Saudi Arabia. Mortalities of animals have been recorded during summer months when the rainfall is negligible or insignificant. Deaths were due to starvation because of reduced availability, accessibility and quality of food plants in the area. In total, 560 oryx and 2815 sand gazelle deaths were recorded since the reintroduction projects began {{till the end of}} 2008. Mortalities of animals were higher in 1999 - 2001, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Grazing of oryx habitat depends on rainfall and animals move over great distances in response to rain. The fence around Mahazat as-Sayd PA prevents natural movements of animals, and artificially concentrates the ungulate populations into possibly unfavourable habitat. The sand gazelle is a highly gregarious and migratory species, moving long distances in search of good quality pastures. Populations of sand gazelle in Central Asia are also known to migrate over large distances, covering several hundred kilometers. It is therefore likely that by preventing natural movements of sand gazelles and oryx, fencing may have reinforced the effects of stressful conditions such as drought. To reduce the catastrophic effects, a Strategy and Action Plan was developed in August 2008 to manage oryx and gazelle within the <b>reserve</b> <b>and</b> with <b>provision</b> for food <b>and</b> water at the five camps in the reserve as emergency plan to minimize mortalities...|$|R

40|$|In {{recent years}} the {{deregulation}} of energy markets and expansion of volatile renewable energy supplies has triggered an increased interest in stochastic optimization models for thermal and hydro-thermal scheduling. Several studies have modelled this as stochastic linear or mixed-integer optimization problems. Although a variety of efficient solution techniques {{have been developed for}} these models, little is published about the added value of stochastic models over deterministic ones. In the context of day-ahead and intraday unit commitment under wind uncertainty, we compare two-stage and multi-stage stochastic models to deterministic ones and quantify their added value. We show that stochastic optimization models achieve minimal operational cost without having to tune reserve margins in advance, and that their superiority over deterministic models grows with the amount of uncertainty in the relevant wind forecasts. We present a modification of the WILMAR scenario generation technique designed to match the properties of the errors in our wind forcasts, and show that this is needed to make the stochastic approach worthwhile. Our evaluation is done in a rolling horizon fashion over the course of two years, using a 2020 central scheduling model of the British National Grid with transmission constraints and a detailed model of pump storage operation <b>and</b> system-wide <b>reserve</b> <b>and</b> response <b>provision.</b> Solving stochastic problems directly is computationally intractable for large instances, and alternative approaches are required. In this study we use a Dantzig-Wolfe reformulation to decompose the problem by scenarios.

A fast, novel schedule combination heuristic is used to construct an optimal primal solution, and numerical results show that knowing this solution from the start also improves the convergence of the lower bound in the column generation method significantly.

Loan to deposit ratio has positive coefficient but not significant so it does not effect loan loss provision while debt to equity ratio has negative coefficient and not significant to loan loas provision. Reserve has negative effect and significant to loan loss provision but it is inappropriate so the hypothesis is being rejected. Size has positive and significant toward loan loss provisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of sex-stereotyped behavior in monomorphic animals, {{where there are}} no sexual differences in form to account for sexual differences in function, is often attributed to intraspecific competition or to differential parental investment. The possibility that the use of different behavioral strategies by each parent may increase reproductive success for both partners through risk partitioning is seldom considered. We studied thick-billed murres (Uria lomvia), where the male exclusively feeds the offspring during the late chick rearing. During the period of biparental care, males fed on "risk-averse" prey (consistent across time and space; unitized risk = 0. 29), whereas females fed on "risk-prone" prey (risk = 0. 59). Males fed at night at 1 colony, during the day at 2 colonies, and there was no pattern at another colony. We suggest that these differences reflect the availability of risk-prone prey. Modeling suggested that mixed-risk pairs had higher success than "risky" or "riskless" pairs. Males accumulated <b>reserves</b> <b>and</b> reduced chick <b>provisioning</b> just prior to fledging. Thus, sex-specific patterns at 1 period (male-only care during postfledging) may have led to sex-specific patterns at earlier periods through the need for specialization in foraging habits and risk. We propose that risk partitioning may contribute to the prevalence of sex-specific behaviors in monomorphic animals and that patterns are likely context specific rather than species specific.
