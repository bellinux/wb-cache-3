5|$|After closure {{the tunnel}} was sealed, {{although}} it remains structurally intact inside. The {{site of the}} lower terminus was cleared and is now an empty site surrounded with construction hoarding. There is a small roundabout directly outside the south tunnel portal. Hereson Road station is now a used car dealership. Four of the cars were sold to the Hollycombe Steam Collection and remain in use, while the remaining three {{were given to the}} Hampshire Narrow Gauge Railway Society. Most of the <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> sleepers were sold to the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway.|$|E
5|$|Although the LNC {{proposed}} {{to convert the}} cemetery branch line into a grand avenue running from Brookwood station through the cemetery, this never took place. The <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> sleepers of the branch were removed in around 1947, and the trackbed became a dirt road and footpath. The run-around loop and stub of the branch line west of Brookwood station remained operational as sidings, before being dismantled on 30 November 1964. After {{the closure of the}} branch line the buildings of the two cemetery stations remained open as refreshment kiosks, and were renamed North Bar and South Bar.|$|E
5|$|An {{extensive}} {{maintenance program}} intended {{to extend the}} service lives of M249s {{has been carried out}} to refurbish rifles, especially units that suffered from wear due to heavy use. In particular the warping of the receiver rails on the early-models was a defect that occurred in heavily used first-generation M249s. This defect however has been completely eliminated on later models and is no longer present on the current-issue M249, which has reinforced <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> full-length welding rather than spot welding. Also being worked on is replacement of the M249's buttstock with a redesigned adjustable stock.|$|E
30|$|The {{interaction}} of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel and the resulting phenomena such as wear and noise are considered as very important issues in railway transportation which allocates considerable research activities in advanced railways in the world yearly since the inappropriate {{interaction of}} the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel has always brought about costly items such as extreme structure of the instruments and fractures of pavement and road bed of the lines and also automotive transportation and most importantly causes irreparable accidents. By analyzing the repair and maintenance railway costs worldwide, we found that a huge expedition {{is done in the}} field of purchase, change and installation of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel in the railway industry every year [5, 6]. The wheel has a special geometric form, and the geometric incompatibility of a wheel’s profile with the geometric characteristics of the rail line could have negative circumstances such as extreme wear of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel and dynamic instability of the railway transportation appliance, since the stability of the railway appliance and the passengers comfort is dependent on the wear of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel [7]. Thus, it could be inferred that the compatibility of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel’s profile is the most vital factor in controlling the wear. The rolling contact of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel will cause wearing of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel profile and in return there will be phenomena such as negative effects in dynamic function of the train and comfort in traveling, the possibility of emersion from the line, permanent misshapes, reduction in the wheel longevity, reduction in security, reduction in the repairing period of the line and, as a result, a reduction in efficiency and an increase in costs [8]. Recognition and reduction in the mentioned phenomena require sufficient knowledge of the wheel <b>and</b> <b>rail</b> wear. Due to the solidity of the contact surfaces of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel, small contact area and the heavy weight applied in railway cars, there is high stress that would lead to phenomena such as wear and fatigue of the <b>rail</b> <b>and</b> wheel.|$|R

5|$|Construction from Brill to Oxford {{had not yet}} begun. Further Acts of Parliament {{were granted}} in 1892 and 1894 varying the {{proposed}} route slightly and allowing for its electrification, but no work was carried out other than some preliminary surveying. On 1 April 1894, with the proposed extension to Oxford still intended, the O exercised a clause of the 1888 Act and took over the Tramway. Work began on upgrading the line {{in preparation for the}} extension. The line from Quainton Road to Brill was relaid with improved rails on transverse sleepers, replacing the original flimsy <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> longitudinal sleepers. At around this time two Manning Wardle locomotives were brought into use.|$|E
5|$|In 2009 the Welsh Assembly Government asked Network Rail {{to conduct}} {{feasibility}} studies on two former track stretches in Wales, {{one of those}} being the line from Bangor to Llangefni. Councillor Clive McGregor was optimistic this could provide an economic stimulus for Anglesey, along with further proposals to extend passenger traffic between Llangefni and Amlwch. In 2011 Network Rail began work on gathering evidence for its study, beginning with cutting away vegetation on track sections to examine the condition of <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> track bedding. Its report {{was expected to be}} published in 2012, before any business cases to reopen the lines could be developed.|$|E
5|$|More than 90 {{species of}} birds breed within the Briar Creek watershed. These include several species of ducks, flycatchers, herons, plovers, <b>rails,</b> <b>and</b> swallows, {{as well as one}} species of {{kingfisher}} and one species of crane. Bald eagles, sandhill cranes, and several species of waterfowl have been observed on Briar Creek Reservoir. Mammals living in the watershed include minks, muskrats, and short-tailed shrews, and the endangered Indiana bat. Fish, damselflies, mayflies, and other macroinvertebrates also inhabit the watershed. A total of 28 species of fish were observed by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission in the watershed in 2006. Earlier, 34 species were observed.|$|E

A temporary building of thin wooden beams and asbestos blocks was erected in 1913, and dedicated to St Hugh. Its altar <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> benches came from Prior Park. Dom Mackey was succeeded in 1918 by Dom Ambrose Agius, who acquired a disused printing works, formerly a barn and converted it into the present church in Westfield, which opened in 1929. It was rebuilt after a serious fire in 1991. It has a statue of the patron on its façade.|$|E
5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on <b>rails</b> <b>and</b> could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. The ground floor of the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E
