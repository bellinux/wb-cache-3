40|$|This {{case study}} {{examined}} how two rowers adapted their <b>rowing</b> <b>patterns</b> following crew {{training as a}} newly formed coxless pair. The two participants were expert (double-oar) single scull-boat rowers. Performing as a crew in the coxless-pair’s sweep-boat, where each rower operates a single oar, on-the-water data were collected before and after a 6 -week intensive team-training program. <b>Rowing</b> <b>patterns</b> were characterized by the horizontal oar angle, oar angular velocity and linear oar-water velocity profiles during the catch (minimal oar angle) to finish (maximal oar angle) half-cycles of the propulsive water phase. After crew training, rowers demonstrated a tighter synchronization and a closer correspondence in oar angle {{at the moment of}} catch, together with a closer matching of the evolution over time of their subsequent oar movements. Most likely due to the inherent asymmetries involved in sweep-boat rowing, the stroke rower also developed a somewhat longer-duration larger-amplitude oar movement than the bow rower. Remarkably, both rowers revealed changes in the inter-cycle variability of their individual <b>patterns</b> of <b>rowing.</b> While the initially more variable stroke rower improved the consistency of his <b>rowing</b> <b>pattern</b> over practice, the initially highly consistent bow rower on the contrary relaxed his tendency to always perform in the same way. We discuss how the crew performance changed over training and to what extent it was associated with changes in individual behaviors. Along the way we demonstrate that the often-used measure of average continuous relative phase does not adequately capture the particularities of the coordination pattern observed. Overall, the results obtained at the individual level of analysis suggest that team benefits were obtained through distinct adaptations of the rowers’ individual <b>rowing</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R

Wheat-pea intercropping in an 8 - 2 <b>row</b> <b>pattern</b> of wheat and pea, respectively, preserved and augmented natural enemies more than a monoculture of wheat. The highest abundance of ladybeetles in 2008 and 2009 occurred in the 8 - 2 <b>row</b> <b>pattern,</b> whereas the highest densities of aphid parasitoids were found in the 4 - 2 <b>row</b> <b>pattern</b> in 2008 and the 8 - 2 <b>row</b> <b>pattern</b> in 2009.

The land equivalent ratio of 1. 121 : 1. 187 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2008 and 1. 114 : 1. 174 for wheat-pea intercropping in 2009 showed that intercropping of wheat and pea has potential to improve the utilization of plant growth resources as compared to sole crops.

Main plots inclouded two planting pattern of corn (P 1 : single row and P 2 : double row), sub plots inclouded two corn densities (D 1 : 7 and D 2 : 10 plant/m 2) and sub sub plots inclouded 4 weed densities (C 1 : 0, C 2 : 2, C 3 : 6, C 4 : 12 plant/m 2).

40|$|The visual-spatial {{aspects of}} {{movement}} {{have been proposed}} to dominate inter-limb stability over constraints inherent in the motor system (see Mechsner, et al., 2001). The underlying principles of within-person bimanual movements are also evident during interpersonal coordination (Schmidt et al., 1990). In both studies coordination was an emergent, rather than an enduring property of the visual display. The impact of perceptual familiarity on the stability of interpersonal coordination is little understood within this context. The present study’s aim was to explore the effects of expertise on coordination stability in a dual-person rowing task. Expert (n = 5) and inexperienced (n = 5) participants used a rowing ergometer positioned behind an expert lead rower on a second ergometer. Phasing between the two seat positions was examined continuously across incremental speeds to exhaustion under two phase modes: a typically synchronous <b>rowing</b> <b>pattern</b> and an asynchronous pattern that required the seat movements of the standard <b>rowing</b> <b>pattern</b> {{to be out of}} phase by 180 degrees. Correlation analyses between positional data sets for the two rowers revealed experts spontaneously switched from the asynchronous mode to the well-practiced and therefore dominant synchronous mode. This occured at a critical frequency associated with routine training intensity. These transitions did not occur when experts rowed under the more stable synchronous mode. In contrast, inexperienced rowers did not exhibit switching under either condition, wherein coordination remained relatively stable across incremental frequencies.

The experimental design was a RCB (r = 4) with a split-split plot restriction on randomization, where hybrids were assigned to main plots, row patterns to subplots and plant populations to sub-subplots. There was a noticeable and statistically significant interaction between hybrid and population at {{three out of four}} locations.

STM results indicate that at low coverage Fe atoms self-assemble on both surfaces into well-separated nanoclusters, which nucleate at equivalent surface sites. Their size, shape, and the observed spatial separation are dictated by the substrate and depend on preparation conditions. Annealing the Fe nanoclusters on Ge(001) at 420 K leads {{to the formation of}} linear nanocluster arrays, which follow the Ge dimer rows of the substrate, due to cluster mobility at such temperature. In turn, linear Fe nanocluster arrays are formed on the MoO 2 /Mo(110) surface at room temperature at a surface coverage greater than 0. 5 monolayer. This is due to the more pronounced <b>row</b> <b>pattern</b> of the MoO 2 /Mo(110) surface compared to Ge(001).

Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling, we show that group Lasso recovers the exact <b>row</b> <b>pattern</b> with high probability over the random design and noise for scalings of (n, p, s) such that the sample complexity parameter given by θ(n, p, s) : = n/[2 ψ(B∗) log(p − s) ] exceeds a critical threshold.

This sparsity-overlap function reveals that, if the design is uncorrelated on the active rows, block ` 1 /` 2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms perfor-mance relative to an ordinary Lasso approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably or-thogonal.

Results showed that maximum grain yield (9230 kg/ha) and harvest index (42. 11 %) between row distance were obtained from 65 cm.

Junglerice and rice flatsedge were the dominant weed species during {{the early stages of the}} crop, while Chinese sprangletop and large crabgrass were the predominant species during flowering stage of the crop. Weed dry matter was not affected by planting pattern of P. Mehak 1; however, for PR 115, weed dry matter was greater in rice grown in uniform rows (244 g m - 2) than in paired rows (183 g m - 2). Planting patterns did not affect weed-free crop growth and yield, but weeds tended to be more abundant in the uniform planting system, particularly under cultivar PR 115. Consequently, this cultivar grew and yielded better under the paired rows when weeds were present. The cultivar PR 115 had greater yield potential than P. Mehak 1, but growth and productivity of P. Mehak 1 were unaffected by the planting patterns, suggesting better competitive ability against weeds than PR 115. The results imply that yield of some aerobic rice cultivars may be improved by exploring competitiveness of rice cultivars through paired row planting patterns.

Zebrafish (Danio rerio) have four cone subtypes arranged into precise rows in the adult retina. Here we describe larval zebrafish cone patterns and investigate a previously unrecognized transition between larval and adult cone mosaic patterns. Cone positions were determined in transgenic zebrafish expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) in their UV-sensitive cones, by the use of multiplex in situ hybridization labelling of various cone opsins. We developed a “mosaic metric” statistical tool to measure local cone order. We found that ratios of the various cone subtypes in larval and adult zebrafish were statistically different. The cone photoreceptors in larvae form a regular heterotypic mosaic array; i. e., the position of any one cone spectral subtype relative to the other cone subtypes is statistically different from random. However, the cone spectral subtypes in larval zebrafish are not arranged in continuous rows as in the adult.

The higher sowing density was the higher yield of sweet maize was, hence the highest ear yield of 9. 67 t ha- 1, on the average for all four hybrids, was recorded at the highest sowing density of 70, 000 plants ha- 1.

Five weeks after planting, an appropriate number of soybean rows were harvested from the 30 "cm pattern to establish row distances of 90, 60, and 30 - 60 cm {{for the remainder of}} the season. ln the greenhouse a test was conducted to evaluate the effects af those variables on seed germination and seedling vigor for the next soybean generation. As a result of full-season sicklepod competition, soybean plants were less branched, set fewer leaves, and presented thinner stems as compared to the control. However, height of soybean plants was not affected by the presence of sicklepod. ln one of the two experiments, number of nodes decreased for soybeans under weed campetition. The yield components [...] number of pods; number of seeds, and seed yield per soybean plant [...] were all similarly reduced due to weed competition. Seeds per pod were decreased to a lesser extent. Soybean seed yields per unit area were significantly diminished by increasing levels af sicklepod ínfestation. While the control produced 3120 kg/ha, the sicklepod densities of 25, 000, 53, 000, and 77, 000 plants/ha reduced seed yíelds 47, 65, and 73 %, respectively. As soybean row distances decreased, number of branches, number of leaves, and stem diameter of soybeans decreased. However, the height of soybean plants increased with narrwing of row width. The components of seed yield [...] number of pods, number of seeds, and seed yield per soybean plant [...] diminished as row spacing was reduced. Maximum difference between row distances for these attributes was attained for soybean plants under weed-free conditions. Generally, as row width decreased, soybean seed yield per unit area increased. Specifically, soybear. s in 90 -cm rows, either in constant or variable <b>row</b> <b>pattern,</b> yielded less than soybeans in 60 - and 30 - 60 -cm rows in the variable pattern. Soil contents of phosphorus, potassium, calcium, and magnesium were not affected by the various levels of sicklepod and soybean populalions. Neither the sicklepod densities nor the soybean row distances influenced seed germination and seedling vigor in the next soybean generation. Sicklepod was a strong competitor with soybeans at all density ranges investigated. Because sicklepod grows taller than soybeans during the reproductive stages of the crop, limited success can be reached by varying row spacing alone. However, this practice is considered an integral measure to complement other methods of sicklepod control. Compared to constant rows, the soybean cropping system using variable row spacings presents the choice of planting soybeans at close row spacings to provide early competition with weeds and the possibility of obtaining a forage crop after the first month of growth, without any decreases on the final seed yields...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous {{navigation}} of robots in {{an agricultural}} environment {{is a difficult}} task due to the inherent uncertainty in the environment. Many existing agricultural robots use computer vision and other sensors to supplement Global Positioning System (GPS) data when navigating. Vision based methods are sensitive to ambient lighting conditions. This is a major disadvantage in an outdoor environment. The current study presents a novel probabilistic sensor model for a 2 D range finder (LIDAR) from first principles. Using this sensor model, a particle filter based navigation algorithm (PF) for autonomous navigation in a maize field was developed. The algorithm was tested in various field conditions with varying plant sizes, different <b>row</b> <b>patterns</b> and at several scanning frequencies. Results showed that the Root Mean Squared Error of the robot heading and lateral deviation were equal to 2. 4 degrees and 0. 04 m, respectively.

The {{findings of this study}} showed that at both planting patterns all plots that received nicosulfuron had significantly higher maize grain yield than other two SU herbicides. At Double <b>Row</b> (DR) planting <b>pattern,</b> all the treatments controlled weeds more effectively than at Single <b>Row</b> (SR) planting <b>pattern</b> and increased maize grain yield by mean of 1. 0 t haG 1. At both planting patterns herbicidal mixture of atrazine and alachlor was the best treatment in controlling weeds. The hoe weeded control and all herbicidal treatments had lower weed dry matter than the untreated control at crop harvest period. In addition the lowest weed dry matter was obtained from the hoe weeded control. Results of this study revealed that nicosulfuron and rimsulfuron were the best and the weakest SU herbicide at both planting patterns, respectively...|$|R
