50|$|In the film, Claudine {{receives}} {{financial aid}} from living on welfare. She {{is able to}} raise her children and provide them with food and shelter because of the financial aid that she receives from {{being a part of}} the welfare system. Even though she does receive financial aid from the government, she <b>receives</b> <b>barely</b> enough money to provide a better living for herself and her six children. Because she <b>barely</b> <b>receives</b> enough financial aid and because she makes little money working, she lives in a slum-like neighborhood in Harlem. Claudine has a job but does not report {{the fact that she is}} employed to the social worker. Claudine works as a housekeeper where she cleans another person's home. The homeowner is white, and financially well off. Claudine never reports her job to the social worker, who happens to visit Claudine's home frequently, because if she does tell her that she has a job, Claudine will no longer be able to receive the same financial aid from the government. Therefore, there exists this sub-theme of welfare and employment and how they conflict in the financial aspect of Claudine's life.|$|R

50|$|In February 1918, the Queensland Railways Patriotic Fund {{pushed to}} {{increase}} the amount of monies coming in by introducing the Ten Miles of Pennies scheme with the intent of raising £2,200 by July of that year. In an open letter addressed to all railway employees, published in the March edition of the Queensland Railway Railway Express, chairman of the Fund, Arthur Crowther explained the reason behind the Ten Miles of Pennies scheme.“The Committee of the Railway Patriotic Fund regret to have to admit a serious falling off in the recipts sic to the Fund, the amount now <b>received</b> <b>barely</b> reaching £200 per month. The claims on the Fund on behalf of the returned soldiers and their dependents, at present, amount to £500 per month. Taking the receipts and expenditure into consideration points to the necessity of immediate action being taken to keep the Fund solvent.”The scheme included appealing for further subscriptions from railway workers as well as other fundraising activities, such as public street collections on the 26 and 27 April and a cheap excursion train journey from Brisbane to Tweeds Heads on 21 April. Railway staff and their families volunteered their time in running these events. It was reported that £4,707 was raised during this campaign.|$|E
50|$|Since 1904, however, Hardin County {{has turned}} powerfully Republican.

The county did trend Democratic {{in the following}} three decades, actually voting more Democratic than the nation at-large between 1972 and 1996. Nonetheless, since 2000 Hardin County has followed the same political trajectory as Tennessee, Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia and Appalachian regions of adjacent states, whereby the Democratic Party’s liberal views on social issues have produced dramatic swings to the Republican Party amongst its almost entirely Southern white population.

5000|$|Over Booth's {{objections}} that a {{move from}} light car production would weaken the {{market share of}} the Scripps-Booth Company, company directors began to approve the additions of larger and larger models to its product lines. Angered by this turn of events, Booth tendered his resignation to the company {{in the autumn of}} 1916, just as Scripps-Booth began to experience a severe drop in sales. At the end of 1917, the company was absorbed by Chevrolet and in the following year, when Chevrolet was acquired by General Motors, Scripps-Booth became a part of the General Motors family. The line was discontinued altogether in 1922. In 1923, Booth began to design his ultimate driving machine, the [...] "Da Vinci". This compact car featured an underslung worm drive axle which allowed for a flat nineteen inch floor (much lower than any other car on the market), cable-controlled hood latches, hanging brake and clutch pedals, and a parking brake in the transmission. Having no interest in manufacturing the car on his own, Booth attempted to sell his novel design to established automakers. He was understandably horrified, then, when Stutz produced a car with a similar underslung drive a year after he had shown the firm the [...] "Da Vinci" [...] plans. A costly patent infringement suit ensued, which Booth eventually won in 1935. By then, however, Stutz was ailing financially and the judgement that Booth <b>received</b> <b>barely</b> covered his own legal expenses. After this disconcerting ordeal, Booth produced just one other vehicle—the [...] "Da Vinci Pup", a small, sleek cyclecar—and that solely for his own pleasure.|$|E
50|$|After the Torgau incident, Szabo, Bloch, Rolfe and Lake {{were part}} of a group of around 250 prisoners sent back to Ravensbrück on 6 October, where Violette was put to work in the fabric store. In late October 1944, the protest women were {{transferred}} to a punishment camp at Königsburg, where they were forced into harsh physical labour felling trees, clearing rock-hard icy ground for the construction of an airfield and digging a trench for a narrow-gauge railway. Violette volunteered for tree-felling in the forest, where the trees gave some shelter from the bitter winds (Lilian and Denise were too ill to join her). In the bitter East Prussian winter of 1945, each day the women were made to stand for Appell (roll-call) in the early morning for up to five hours before being sent to work, many of them freezing to death. Szabo was dressed only in the summer clothes she had been wearing when sent to Germany and the women <b>received</b> <b>barely</b> any food and slept in frozen barracks without blankets. According to Christine Le Scornet, a seventeen-year-old French girl whom Violette befriended and Jeannie Rousseau, the co-leader of the Torgau revolt, she maintained her morale, was optimistic about liberation and continued to plan to escape. On 19 or 20 January 1945, the three British agents were recalled to Ravensbrück and sent first to the Strafblock, where they were possibly brutally assaulted and then to the punishment bunker, where they were kept in solitary confinement. The women were already in poor physical condition—Rolfe could barely walk—and the abuse finally weakened Szabo's morale.|$|E

40|$|The North American Great Plains {{experienced}} rapid {{settlement and}} economic growth from 1870 to 1914. The advance of settlement {{and the development of}} local economy, while generally contiguous, were by no means uniform. Soil conditions, underground water supplies, the network of rivers and streams, rainfall, and growing season are all attributes of the physical environment that vary across the plains both longitudinally and latitudinally. In addition, the extent of effective settlement in the Mississippi River valley, the natural starting point for westward expansion onto the plains, varied considerably in 1865. Given these economic and environmental preconditions, {{it is not surprising that}} settlement on the Great Plains after 1870 varied in timing and degree. Although the physical geography of the area must be taken into account, the differences in the timing and amount of economic development of the region were largely due to the uneven expansion of the railroad network after 1870. Some areas were heavily over endowed with railroad facilities, while others <b>received</b> <b>barely</b> adequate, or even niggardly, treatment at the hands of railroad businessmen and entrepreneurs. The construction and operation of railroads on the plains were governed in part by strategic, managerial, financial, and institutional forces that produced a transport system with no necessary relationship to the contemporary or potential economic landscape of the Canadian and American Great Plains. This article examines the process of corporate railroad decision making in the larger context of investments, developmental strategies, and operational considerations, and explores the spatial evolution of four major railroad systems from their origins to 1915. These railroads, two American and two Canadian, demonstrate various strategies of system development. Generalizations drawn from a brief historical overview, combined with insights from other analyses of entrepreneurial and business practices of nineteenth-century railroads and their leaders, suggest a hypothetical sequence of railroad system development at the level of the corporation in nineteenth century North America. TERMINOLOGY Within the context of railroad systems, from both an investment and an operational point of view, several concepts and terms have been developed by business and economic historians to facilitate the understanding of investor and corporate decision making. As these ideas will be applied to the development of the four Great Plains railroads considered here, some brief definitions are warranted. First, in order to understand the investment strategies pursued by individual capitalists and entrepreneurs, it is useful to differentiate, as Arthur M. Johnson and Barry E. Supple have done, between developmental and opportunistic investments and investment strategies in the nineteenth-century railroad business. A developmental investment strategy is one in which an 2 ̆ 7 investor looks to long-term growth in a booming region for the economic rewards from capital investment. Opportunistic investments, on the other hand, have 2 ̆ 2 relatively shorter time horizons, the context of which was not so much future income growth as the securing of profits from available markets whether for goods, for railroad services, or for stocks and bonds. 2 ̆ 2 There is a continuum from developmental to opportunistic investment, and while any individual 2 ̆ 7 s current motives can be placed somewhere along this continuum, those motives, or the criteria for subsequent investment decisions, could easily change with time or with changes in other financial and economic factors not necessarily bearing directly on railroading. Local merchants and farmers committed their capital to early local railroad companies as a means of increasing their business profits. Distant investors often purchased railroad bonds and debentures with a view to stable, long-term developmental profits. By the late nineteenth century, many railroads had come under the control of strictly financial, large-scale capitalist interests. Often located at some distance from their railroads, financiers used their properties for much broader strategic purposes, manipulating the securities, freight rates, connections, and through routes almost at will. As often as opportunistic profits were made-through financial wizardry, shady construction contracts, or dealings in railroad lands-great fortunes disappeared overnight in the aftermath of bank failures, overextension, or bankruptcy and receivership...|$|E
