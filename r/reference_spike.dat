Previ-ous work supports {{the hypothesis that the}} whisking-induced spike train entrains a neural implementation of a phase-locked loop (NPLL) in the vibrissal system. Herewe extend thiswork and explore how the entrained NPLL decodes the delay of the novel, contact-induced stimulus and fa-cilitates object localization. We consider two implementations of NPLLs, which are based on a single neuron or a neural circuit, respectively, and evaluate the resulting temporal decoding capabilities. Depending on the structure of the NPLL, it can lock in either a phase- or co-phase-sensitive mode, which is sensitive to the timing of the input with respect to the beginning of either the current or the next cycle, respectively. The co-phase-sensitive mode is shown to be unique to circuit-based NPLLs. Concentrating on temporal decoding in the vibrissal system of rats, we conclude that both the nature of the information processing task and the response characteristics suggest that the computation is sensitive to the co-phase. Consequently, we suggest that the underlying thalamocortical loop should implement a circuit-based NPLL. ...|$|E
40|$|Traditionally, {{event-driven}} simulations {{have been}} limited to the very restricted class of neuronal models for which the timing of future spikes can be expressed in closed form. Recently, the class of models that is amenable to event-driven simulation has been extended {{by the development of}} techniques to accurately calculate firing times for some integrate-and-fire neuron models that do not enable the prediction of future spikes in closed form. The motivation of this development is the general perception that time-driven simulations are imprecise. Here, we demonstrate that a globally time-driven scheme can calculate firing times that cannot be discriminated from those calculated by an event-driven implementation of the same model; moreover, the time-driven scheme incurs lower computational costs. The key insight is that time-driven methods are based on identifying a threshold crossing in the recent past, which can be implemented by a much simpler algorithm than the techniques for predicting future threshold crossings that are necessary for event-driven approaches. As run time is dominated by the cost of the operations performed at each incoming spike, which includes spike prediction in the case of event-driven simulation and retrospective detection in the case of time-driven simulation, the simple time-driven algorithm outperforms the event-driven approaches. Additionally, our method is generally applicable to all commonly used integrate-and-fire neuronal models; we show that a nonlinear model employing a standard adaptive solver can reproduce a <b>reference</b> <b>spike</b> train {{with a high degree of}} precision...|$|E
40|$|Simultaneous {{recordings}} {{were made}} of the discharges of inspiratory bulbospinal neurones and phrenic or external intercostal alpha-motoneurones in the anaesthetized cat. The connexions between these neurones were studied by the construction of cross-correlation histograms from their discharges. Peaks observed in the cross-correlation histograms were divided into three groups {{on the basis of}} their time courses: narrow, medium-width and high-frequency oscillations (h. f. o.). Narrow peaks were defined as having half-widths less than 1. 1 ms and medium-width peaks as having half-widths greater than this, while h. f. o. was characterized by periodic waves in the range 60 - 120 Hz. H. f. o. peaks were interpreted as being derived from the well known periodic synchronization of medullary inspiratory neurones in this frequency range. The time courses and latencies of the medium-width peaks could be quantitatively explained by a simple model representing excitation of the motoneurones by bulbospinal neurones whose discharges showed synchronization within +/- 1 ms of the <b>reference</b> <b>spike,</b> together with temporal dispersion in bulbospinal axons having a distribution of conduction velocities given by the measurements of this study. Such an explanation was essential for some of the medium-width peaks, whose latencies were short compared to the conduction times to the spinal cord for their own axons, but for other medium-width peaks oligosynaptic excitation of the motoneurones from the identified bulbospinal neurones was another possible explanation. The narrow peaks were of appropriate durations for monosynaptic connexions and were all at appropriate latencies (0. 6 - 2. 4 ms after the calculated arrival time of the bulbospinal impulse in the segment concerned). It is concluded from the observations of narrow peaks that monosynaptic excitation exists between inspiratory bulbospinal neurones and both phrenic and external intercostal motoneurones. However, because of the existence of presynaptic synchronization, as shown by the presence of the medium-width peaks, such a conclusion is predicated upon being able to discriminate against such an effect. The model showed that this restriction applies just as much to the measurements of excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s) by spike-triggered averaging as it does to cross-correlation measurements. We suggest that the discrimination against presynaptic synchronization here was possible only because the long conduction distance created temporal dispersion in the synchronized presynaptic impulses...|$|E

40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} {{for the existence}} of synchrony between the spike trains of muscle afferents of the passive cat medial gastrocnemius muscle held at fixed length. Synchrony between the spike trains of a population of muscle afferents was quantified by means of a synchronization index (Is), derived from spike-triggered averages of the muscle-nerve neurogram and the rectified neurogram. A previously used test based solely upon the neurogram average (Watt, Stauffer, Taylor, Reinking & Stuart, 1976) is shown to be invalid. The differences between experimentally derived Is values and theoretical Is values derived for the condition of asynchrony were compared to estimated confidence limits for those differences. This comparison revealed that twenty-two of fifty-three muscle-afferent spike trains whose rectified averages satisfied certain conditions for interpreting the Is were synchronized with the discharge of other afferents. The form of the rectified averages of another eight afferents suggested that these afferents might also have been synchronized. Synchrony in the discharge of muscle afferents was found in three experiments in which the neurogram was recorded from a single nerve branch to medial gastrocnemius, {{as well as in the}} data of experiments in which the whole muscle nerve was used. The degree of synchrony was similar for Ia, spindle group II and Ib afferents. The magnitude of the synchrony found in these experiments was judged by comparison to the results of analog simulations and the increase in Is values resulting from the application of small, quick stretches to the medial gastrocnemius muscle. The degree of synchrony found on average was approximately equivalent to that of a single spike occurring once for every four discharges of the <b>reference</b> <b>spike</b> train. Simulations were performed to determine the distortion of monosynaptic excitatory post-synaptic potentials (e. p. s. p. s) obtained by spike-triggered averaging which would be produced by synchrony between the spike trains of Ia and spindle group II afferents of the magnitude found in this study. These simulations indicate that the apparent amplitude would be increased by approximately 4 microV on average. Both the 10 - 90 % rise time and the half-width would increase, the effects being greater for smaller e. p. s. p. s. Consequently, the synchrony found in this study is of most concern in the study of small post-synaptic potentials, such as those due to spindle group II afferents...|$|E

Although individual laboratories have developed quality control samples, there is no widely available performance standard of biological complexity (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across different laboratories in the community.

40|$|Abstract : Cortical {{microcircuitry}} plays {{a pivotal}} role in encoding sensory information reaching the cortex. However, the fundamental knowledge concerning the mechanisms that govern feature-encoding by these sub-networks is still sparse. Here, we show through multi electrode recordings in V 1 of conventionally prepared anesthetized cats, that an avalanche of synergistic neural activity occurs between functionally connected neurons in a cell assembly in response to the presented stimulus. The results specifically show that once the <b>reference</b> neuron <b>spikes</b> in a connected neuron-pair, it facilitates the response of its companion (target) neuron for 50 ms and, thereafter, the excitability of the target neuron declines. On the other hand, the functionally unconnected neurons do not facilitate each other’s activity within the 50 ms time-window. The added excitation (facilitation) of connected neurons is almost four times the responsiveness of unconnected neurons. This suggests that connectedness confers the added excitability to neurons; consequently leading to feature-encoding within the emergent 50 ms-period. Furthermore, the facilitation significantly decreases as a function of orientation selectivity spread...|$|R
