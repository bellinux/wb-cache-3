500|$|Webber hired Ben van Os as his {{production}} designer because [...] "... he wasn't {{intimidated by the}} period obligations. He was {{much more interested in}} story and character." [...] For inspiration in constructing the film's sets, Webber and van Os studied the works of Vermeer and other artists of the period, such as Gerard ter Borch. Set designer Todd van Hulzen said the goal was to [...] "... reflect that quiet, sober, almost moralizing ethos that you see in Dutch paintings." [...] They built Vermeer's house on one of Luxembourg's largest film soundstages, a three-story set where they designed rooms that were meant to convey a lack of privacy. According to van Os, the film was about [...] "being observed," [...] so they intended Griet to always feel that she was being watched. In addition, they built two other interior sets to represent the homes of Griet and van Ruijven– Griet's home possessed Calvinistic characteristics while van Ruijven's contained mounted animals to reflect his [...] "predatory nature." [...] The Mauritshuis museum made a high resolution photograph of the actual painting, which was then shot on a <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> {{to be used in the}} film.|$|E
500|$|During the {{production}} of the film, the character model department was headed by Joe Grant, whose department was responsible for the building of three-dimensional clay models of the characters in the film, known as maquettes. These models were then given to the staff to observe how a character should be drawn from any given angle desired by the artists. The model makers also built working models of Geppetto's cuckoo clocks, as well as Stromboli's gypsy wagon and the Coachman's carriage. However, owing to the difficulty animating a realistic moving vehicle, the artists filmed the carriage maquettes on a miniature set using stop motion animation. Then each frame of the animation was transferred onto animation cels using an early version of a Xerox. The cels were then painted on the back and overlaid on top of background images with the cels of the characters to create the completed shot on the <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera.</b> Like Snow White, live-action footage [...] was shot for Pinocchio with the actors playing the scenes in pantomime, supervised by Hamilton Luske. Rather than tracing, which would result in stiff unnatural movement, the animators used the footage as a guide for animation by studying human movement and then incorporating some poses into the animation (though slightly exaggerated).|$|E
500|$|Post-production {{lasted for}} {{fourteen}} months. Because {{the film was}} made before computer animation and digital compositing were widely used, all the animation was done using cels and optical compositing. First, the animators and lay-out artists were given black and white printouts of the live action scenes (known as [...] "photo stats"), and they placed their animation paper on top of them. The artists then drew the animated characters {{in relationship to the}} live action footage. Due to Zemeckis' dynamic camera moves, the animators had to confront the challenge of ensuring the characters were not [...] "slipping and slipping all over the place." [...] After rough animation was complete, it would run through the normal process of traditional animation until the cels were shot on the <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> with no background. The animated footage was then sent to ILM for compositing, where technicians would animate three lighting layers (shadows, highlights and tone mattes) separately, {{in order to make the}} cartoon characters look three-dimensional and give the illusion of the characters being affected by the lighting on set. Finally, the lighting effects were optically composited on to the cartoon characters, who were, in turn, composited into the live-action footage. One of the most difficult effects in the film was Jessica's dress in the night club scene, because it had flashing sequins, an effect accomplished by filtering light through a plastic bag scratched with steel wool.|$|E
5000|$|Referring {{to her own}} {{experience}} at the company, Janet Yale said [...] "This was before computer graphics and all film effects work was done with chemicals, <b>rostrum</b> <b>cameras</b> and optical printers. It was basically a craft skill, there was no formal training for it." ...|$|R
50|$|Early <b>rostrum</b> <b>cameras</b> {{were largely}} adapted from {{existing}} equipment, but after World War II industry pioneer John Oxberry made some key refinements to the design. His company, Oxberry Products, {{then went on}} to produce some of the best-known models, which were used by leading film and animation studios around the world. Other manufacturers included Acme, Forox, Marron Carrel, Mangum Sickles, the German company Crass, and Neilson-Hordell in the UK. Some of these machines were somewhat smaller and more cheaply built than the Oxberry models, but were ideal for general purpose work, such as producing titles and copying artwork to film.|$|R
5000|$|Among {{the most}} common types of {{animation}} <b>rostrum</b> <b>cameras</b> was the Oxberry. Such cameras were always made of black anodized aluminum, and commonly had two pegbars, one {{at the top and}} one {{at the bottom of the}} lightbox. The Oxberry Master Series had four pegbars, two above and two below, and sometimes used a [...] "floating pegbar" [...] as well. The height of the column on which the camera was mounted determined the amount of zoom achievable on a piece of artwork. Such cameras were massive mechanical affairs which might weigh close to a ton and take hours to break down or set up.|$|R

2500|$|Soon {{after graduating}} from film school, Hertzfeldt {{purchased}} his own 35mm <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> and made his next animated short, Rejected. Released in theaters in 2000, the short won dozens of awards, was nominated for an Oscar, and became a cult classic that is frequently quoted and referenced in pop culture. Fans of the cartoon {{have been known to}} wear costumes, re-enact their favorite scenes in fan films, and some have had tattoos made of their favorite characters. Public screenings of the short sometimes become a [...] "Rocky Horror Picture Show-esque feedback loop" [...] of fans reciting favorite lines back at the screen. The short's enduring popularity has led it to be described as [...] "this generation's A Hard Day's Night".|$|E
2500|$|The opening credits {{see images}} of the three {{principal}} actors peel {{on and off the}} screen sequentially. These appear over a background of still photographs of everyday life in South London. The sequence was conceived by graphic designer, Peter Clayton, as a [...] "metaphor for the vagaries of the Trotters' lifestyle", whereby money was earned and quickly lost again. Clayton had also considered using five-pound notes having Del's face. The action was shot manually frame by frame, and took around six weeks to complete. Clayton knew {{that it was important to}} have the characters established in the titles, and prepared a storyboard depicting his ideas using drawings. He photographed various locations with a photographer, and the titles were shot using a <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> and not edited. Brian Stephens, a professional animator, was hired to create the labels' movement.|$|E
50|$|As {{a former}} Navy {{photographer}} forging a career operating <b>rostrum</b> <b>cameras,</b> he met Anderson filming a series called You've Never Seen This about unusual circus acts. Finding a shared interest in film-making, Provis teamed with Anderson creating AP Films {{with the original}} intention to make commercials. As {{a result of an}} advert featuring a puppet, the company was approached in 1957 by Roberta Leigh to create a children's series The Adventures of Twizzle for Associated Rediffusion. This led to AP Films' early puppet shows including Twizzle, Torchy the Battery Boy and Four Feather Falls, although Provis left the company amicably in 1959; he was cautious, and Anderson was adventurous. Provis was worried about the amount of film stock him and Anderson were using. He was also neurotic about the company going bust, in contrast to Anderson, who was determined to get the best possible result, even if it meant the company did go bust.|$|R

5000|$|In 1969, Kitching also {{collaborated with}} veteran Hungarian-born British {{animator}} John Halas, {{who had given}} him a pre-war 35mm animation <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera.</b> With this, he produced [...] "The Dream of Arthur Sleap", a cinema commercial for the British Film Institute (BFI), and [...] "Auntie Takes A Trip" [...] for the British Kinematograph, Sound and Television Society (BKSTS).|$|E
50|$|An {{animation}} camera, {{a type of}} <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera,</b> is a movie camera specially {{adapted for}} frame-by-frame shooting animation or stop motion. It consists of a camera body with lens and film magazines, a stand that allows the camera to be raised and lowered, and a table, often with both top and underneath lighting. The artwork to be photographed is placed on this table.|$|E

50|$|In {{the later}} {{years of the}} {{animation}} <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera,</b> stepper motors controlled by computers were attached to the various axes of movement of the camera, thus saving many hours of hand cranking by human operators. A notable early use of computerized cameras was in Star Wars (1977), using the Dykstra system at Lucas' Sun Valley facility. Gradually, motion control techniques were adopted throughout the industry. While several computer camera software packages became available in the early 1980s, the Tondreau System {{became one of the}} most widely adopted.|$|E
5000|$|Establishing {{together}} the Zanthus Films partnership, {{for which she}} reverted to her family name Blackwood, they operated {{from their home in}} Hawthorn, [...] producing documentaries including the BP-commissioned Three in a Million (1959), [...] Port of Melbourne (1961), and You Are Not Alone (1961) on the then tabu subject of breast cancer and masectomy. These titles were amongst early Australian Film Institute Award winners, as was the film Anzac (1959), scripted by Cyril Pearl, which pioneered the use of historical stills with <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> effects.|$|E
5000|$|In film editing, the {{technique}} may {{be achieved through}} the use of a <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera,</b> although today it is more common to use software. Virtually all non-linear editing systems provide a tool to implement this technically simple effect, although only some systems, such as iMovie and Openshot for Linux, specifically call it a Ken Burns Effect; it is usually simply referred to as pan and zoom. Final Cut Pro, Apple TV and Apple's iMovie video editing program include a photo slideshow option labelled [...] "Ken Burns Effect".|$|E
50|$|A <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> is a {{specially}} designed camera used in television production and filmmaking to animate a still picture or object. It consists of a moving lower platform on which the article to be filmed is placed, while the camera is placed above on a column. Many visual effects can be created from this simple setup, although it is most often used to add interest to static objects. The camera can, for example, traverse across a painting, and using wipes and zooms, change a still picture into a sequence suitable for television or movie productions.|$|E
50|$|Once {{finished}} and saved to the floppy, a slide was then 'imaged' onto 35mm transparency via an electronic <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera.</b> A batch file on the VAX mini-computer would then send the images {{to the camera}} one at a time. It took about 2 minutes to produce a 2000 line resolution slide. It was also possible to mix traditional media (slide text photographed on a manual rostrum via litho film negatives) and the background 'double-exposed' over the text via the Genigraphics system. This saved time when slide presentations were in a hurry (as they usually were!).|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{animation}} (also called cel animation or hand-drawn animation) was {{the process}} used for most animated {{films of the}} 20th century. The individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings, first drawn on paper. To {{create the illusion of}} movement, each drawing differs slightly from the one before it. The animators' drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels, which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings. The completed character cels are photographed one-by-one against a painted background by a <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> onto motion picture film.|$|E

5000|$|The {{series title}} {{sequence}} used a <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> {{to create a}} montage of three images, the first showing a silhouetted British soldier standing over the grave of a comrade, the camera first focuses on the cross, where the almost imperceptible words IN MEMORY are glanced, the second shows a uniformed, skeletal corpse by {{the entrance to a}} dugout. The final image shows a lone British soldier, looking directly into the camera apparently surrounded by corpses, which is a montage of several images combined for dramatic effect. The original image of the staring soldier, showing him surrounded by fellow soldiers rather than corpses, was taken from [...] in the Imperial War Museum photograph archive but has been described as having quickly become symbolic of the First World War. This title sequence was set against the series theme music, composed by Wilfred Josephs and performed by the BBC Northern Orchestra.|$|E
50|$|Before {{releasing}} the 914, Xerox tested {{the market by}} introducing a developed version of the prototype hand-operated equipment known as the Flat-plate 1385. The 1385 was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation. As a consequence, it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market, perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the Addressograph-Multigraph Multilith 1250 and related sheet-fed offset printing presses. It {{was little more than}} a high quality, commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera,</b> complete with photo-flood lighting and timer. The glass film/plate had been replaced with a selenium-coated aluminum plate. Clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film. A skilled user could produce fast, paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method. Having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry, Xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offset's market share.|$|E
50|$|Traditional {{silhouette}} animation as invented by Reiniger is subdivision of cutout animation (itself {{one of the}} many forms of stop motion). It utilises figures cut out of paperboard, sometimes reinforced with thin metal sheets, and tied together at their joints with thread or wire (usually substituted by plastic or metal paper fasteners in contemporary productions) which are then moved frame-by-frame on an animation stand and filmed top-down with a <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> - such techniques were used, albeit with stylistic changes, by such practitioners as Noburō Ōfuji in the 1940s and Bruno J. Böttge in the 1970s.http://ottawa.awn.com/archives/ottawa76.html Michel Ocelot's television series Ciné si (Cinema If, 1989) was a little different, combining cutouts and cels and also, more occasionally, live-action and clay animation (this series is better known as Princes et princesses, the feature film version mentioned below). This was also the first {{silhouette animation}} to successfully make characters appear to speak for themselves (traditionally, either intertitles or voice-over narration had been used) as the mixed medium made accurate lip syncing possible.http://www.heeza.fr/description.php?lang=2&path=64&sort=Article&page=0&id=296 Traditional animation {{can also be used to}} imitate silhouette animation, as seen regularly in Be-PaPas' Shōjo Kakumei Utena (Revolutionary Girl Utena, 1997).|$|E
5000|$|Mott {{describes}} {{the process of}} designing the album cover in his essay 'Hip Hop in The Daisy Age': [...] "We {{have come up with}} the 'Daisy Age' visual concept. De La Soul visit our loft where we lay them down on the floor facing up, their heads making a triangle. We photograph them whilst hanging precariously off a step ladder, one idea being that the cover would not have a right way up. CD's have yet to be the dominant musical format so the vinyl album sleeve is our most effective way of making a statement. We layer the coloured hand drawn flower designs made with Posca paint pens on acetate over the black and white photographic portrait print, which is <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera</b> copied. This is well before the time of Apple Macs and scanning etc. ... The intent of the design of De La Soul's, 3 Feet High and Rising LP cover is to be new and bright, with the overlaying of the fluorescent flowers and text reflecting a synthetic pop cartoon look ... This is a move away from the prevailing macho hip hop visual codes which dominate to this day".|$|E

5000|$|When {{an entire}} {{sequence}} has {{been transferred to}} cels, the photography process begins. Each cel involved in a frame of a sequence is laid {{on top of each}} other, with the background {{at the bottom of the}} stack. A piece of glass is lowered onto the artwork in order to flatten any irregularities, and the composite image is then photographed by a special animation camera, also called <b>rostrum</b> <b>camera.</b> The cels are removed, and the process repeats for the next frame until each frame in the sequence has been photographed. Each cel has registration holes, small holes along the top or bottom edge of the cel, which allow the cel to be placed on corresponding peg bars before the camera to ensure that each cel aligns with the one before it; if the cels are not aligned in such a manner, the animation, when played at full speed, will appear [...] "jittery." [...] Sometimes, frames may need to be photographed more than once, in order to implement superimpositions and other camera effects. Pans are created by either moving the cels or backgrounds one step at a time over a succession of frames (the camera does not pan; it only zooms in and out).|$|E
