5|$|After {{the landing}} at Normandy, {{a revival of}} Anvil became {{increasingly}} attractive to the Allied planners.

5|$|Despite the {{continued}} designs {{and interest in}} the idea, no funding was ever appropriated {{for the construction of}} a flight-deck cruiser; in addition, evaluation of the design by the Naval War College determined that even a 12,000-ton ship was too small for the concept's intended characteristics to be effectively realized, and thus the ship would be ineffective in battle. In 1940, the design was formally shelved, although provision was made for <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> the concept at a future date. The entry of the United States into World War II following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, however, removed the primary justifications for the concept of a hybrid warship, as naval limitations treaties were now moot and adequate funding was now available for the construction of more conventional ships. As a result, the flight deck cruiser concept was never revisited.|$|E

5|$|In British Guiana, {{the leftist}} People's Progressive Party (PPP) {{candidate}} Cheddi Jagan won {{the position of}} chief minister in a colonially administered election in 1953, but was quickly forced to resign from power after Britain's suspension of the still-dependent nation's constitution. Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues. Jagan again won the colonial elections in 1957 and 1961; despite Britain's shift to a <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> its view of the left-wing Jagan as a Soviet-style communist at this time, the United States pressured the British to withhold Guyana's independence until an alternative to Jagan could be identified, supported, and brought into office.|$|E

Coon suspected a possible failure of the right rudder, or a problem with the fuel system, as well as a possible improper weight distribution. Coon also argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. In April 2015, the NTSB declined the request, citing that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> the original findings.|$|E
5|$|On January 27, 1990, U.S. District Judge Thomas Rutherford Brett {{dismissed}} {{seven of}} the nine claims before him, and on March 24, the plaintiffs filed a motion to drop the two remaining claims in hopes that the judge would reconsider the claims already dismissed. The plaintiffs also filed for a restraining order to halt construction activities. In support of their filings, the turnpike opponents alleged that OTA was illegally dumping material into waterways. OTA responded by producing U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) documentation showing that no illegal discharge had taken place, and that USACE had not issued any cease and desist orders due to unlawful activity. OTA argued that the plaintiffs' requests for a restraining order and <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> the dismissed claims were invalid {{because there was no}} change in their legal authority or the facts surrounding the case to warrant such a reconsideration.|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{examine the}} question {{as to whether or not}} the requirement of the exhaustion of internal remedies is desirable in the administration of social assistance in South Africa. An investigation, with particular reference to the <b>reconsiderations</b> <b>of</b> its decisions by the South African Social Security Agency (SASSA), and the decisions of the Independent Tribunal appeal against the decisions of SASSA, revealed that there are delays in obtaining the reasons required for <b>reconsiderations</b> <b>of</b> the decisions by the Agency, as well as information required by the Independent Tribunal for appeal against the decisions of the Agency. I contend that there is sufficient evidence of ignorance of the right to request the <b>reconsiderations</b> <b>of</b> decisions by the Agency, as well as the appeal against such decisions. There appears to be a dearth of information on the role and function of the Independent Tribunal. There seems to be ineffective communication of decisions of the Agency and the appeals to the applicants. The fact that the exhaustion of internal remedies in the administration of social assistance is inexpensive and more appropriate than the judicial reviews, does not seem to be justified. The conclusion recommends some remedial legislative and administrative measures are recommended with a view to addressing this problem. The suggestion is made to investigate some of the questions raised in the research, such as the causes for failure to communicate the decisions of the Agency and the Independent Tribunal to the applicants.

5|$|The ACCC {{conceded that}} the state governments were not {{carrying}} on businesses in procuring the medical products. This meant that the governments were immune from Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. Baxter argued that this immunity extended to itself, by claiming derivative governmental immunity. On 16 May 2005, The Federal Court of Australia (Allsop J presiding) found in Baxter's favour at first instance. While {{the court held that}} Baxter would have breached the TPA, governmental immunity under Section2B extended to Baxter Healthcare. Allsop J's judgment was upheld unanimously on appeal to the full bench of the Federal Court (Justices Mansfield, Dowsett and Gyles presiding). The full bench expressed unease about its own judgment, stating that the question of derivative governmental immunity should be left to the High Court for <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> Bradken.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, at the {{direction}} of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, Senator David Feeney, the Defence Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal opened an inquiry into thirteen cases of unresolved recognition for past acts of gallantry. Among the group were eleven naval personnel, including Sheean. Known as the 'Valour Inquiry', the Tribunal was directed to determine if the individuals were unduly overlooked for recognition {{at the time of their}} actions and, if so, whether retrospective awards were appropriate. The inquiry lasted two years and witnessed 166 written submissions from the public, before the Tribunal reported its findings in January 2013. In the case of Sheean, the Tribunal found that there was no manifest injustice with the award of the Mention in Despatches, and that there was no new evidence to support the <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> Sheean for a Victoria Cross for Australia. If Sheean had lived, they reported, he might have been recommended for either the Conspicuous Gallantry Medal or the Distinguished Service Medal instead, but neither medal could be awarded posthumously in 1942. The Tribunal did recommend that the RAN perpetuate the use of Sheean as the name of a major combatant vessel.|$|E
5|$|The public {{loved the}} film, with lines {{stretching}} outside of theaters as {{people had to}} wait for the next showing. This, along with box office numbers, led to a <b>reconsideration</b> <b>of</b> the film by critics, and it eventually received a very large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and the rest of Asia, France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made, and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films. Psycho was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $12 million for the studio on release, and $15 million {{by the end of the}} year. Hitchcock's second most profitable was Family Plot ($7,541,000), and third place was a tie between Torn Curtain (1966) and Frenzy (1972), each earning $6,500,000. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $32 million in domestic theaters.|$|E
