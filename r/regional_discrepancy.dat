Annual mean values of the PM 10 concentrations and AOD show a strong spatial correlation, indicating the consistent presence of aerosol concentrations. However, the temporal correlation between the monthly values of the PM 10 concentrations and AOD indicates a regional contrast in their seasonality.

40|$|China has a {{diversity}} of climates and a unique historic national heating policy which greatly affects indoor thermal environment and the occupants’ thermal response. This paper quantitatively analyzes the data from a large-scale field study across the country conducted from 2008 to 2011 in residential buildings. The study covers nine typical cities located in the five climate zones including Severe Cold (SC), Cold (C), Hot Summer and Cold Winter (HSCW), Hot Summer and Warm Winter (HSWW) and Mild (M) zones. It is revealed that there exists a large <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancy</b> in indoor thermal environ- ment, the worst performing region being the HSCW zone. Human’s long-term climate adaptation leads to wider range of acceptable thermal comfort temperature. Different graphic comfort zones with accept- able range of temperature and humidity for the five climate zones are obtained using the adaptive Predictive Mean Vote (aPMV) model. The results show that occupants living in the poorer thermal environments in the HSCW and HSWW zones are more adaptive and tolerant to poor indoor conditions than those living in the north part of China where central heating systems are in use. It is therefore recommended to develop regional evaluation standards of thermal environments responding to climate characteristics {{as well as local}} occupants’ acclimatization and adaptation in order to meeting dual targets of energy conservation and indoor thermal environment improvement...|$|E
40|$|Accompanying by {{the rapid}} {{urbanization}} process of China, unprecedented amounts of cement have been poured into urban construction {{over the last}} decade. Since research is still scarce on the factors underlying the cement consumption, the motivation {{of this paper is}} to provide insight into cement-based socioeconomic metabolism and to improve understanding of the linkage between human activities and cement consumption. To explore the key impact factors of cement consumption, an extended STIRPAT model is exploited in this paper to examine the effect of population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita, cement consumption intensity, fixed investment and urbanization level with regional panel data of China from 2005 to 2013. The empirical results indicate that fixed investment and GDP per capita are the decisive driving factors of cement consumption. The unbalanced investment between infrastructure and people's livelihood reflects bias urbanization policy in China. Inverted-U shaped nexus between cement consumption and urbanization, as well as GDP per capita, are observed in the empirical results. Moreover, regional heterogeneities are taken into account in the model estimation. On the ground of the empirical findings, several policy recommendations are provided for policy makers. It is suggested that policy makers should take account of the <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancy</b> and implement a sustainable urbanization strategy to curtail cement consumption. Only when excessive fixed investment is curbed does the enthusiasm of cement consumption calm down. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Innovations are {{key factor}} for {{developing}} of the regions and their competitiveness. There are significant <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> in the Pilsen region, with specific regions {{along the border}} with Bavaria. On one hand, there is economically strong core area around the Pilsen agglomeration, and on the other hand, on contrary with this fact, there are poor borderland regions. The result of those <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies,</b> having their roots in past, is weakening of the regional cohesion that finally leads to impairing of its competitiveness in terms of current integration process within the EU. Ascertainment of the innovation potential of the Pilsen region and comparing its competitiveness with neighboring Bavarian regions should be a fundamental material that can help to seek tools for efficient regional development of borderland regions. Their innovation potential is expected to be lower in comparison with the core regions, their competitive advantage is, however, their geographical position. They are located near to richer Bavarian regions and thus influences of the borders effects are expected. Diffusion effect and effect of potentially different could positively influence the situation in the Czech borderland. That’s why the authors also measured the innovation potential in neighboring Bavarian region. The goal of this territorial analysis was the socio-economic structure of targeted area, <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> (in terms of demography, education and employment), innovation potential of local businesses, research and development, and how those issues are interconnected with commercial sector. Results of the research are maps of indexes of innovations in sub regions. It is obvious, that there is a strong concentration of innovative activities to Pilsen and there are different approaches to innovation in the Pilsen region in comparison with Bavaria. The institutions focused on innovation infrastructure within the Pilsen region are mostly located into Pilsen. If there is a stakeholder interested in innovation outside of Pilsen, information innovation centers (which are only a few, though) refer this stakeholder into Pilsen. Innovation information centers in Bavaria are, on the other hand, very dispersed. These centers are closer to the stakeholders of regional development and they are active in disseminating of innovation effort and possibilities in their target area. If we look at the EU globally, we can see that Bavarian regions belong to top innovative regions, however the Pilsen region (the part of NUTS 2 Jihozapad) belongs to group of “slightly innovating members”.

This correction on altimetric measurements, provided by a dedicated radiometer aboard the satellite, directly depends on the atmospheric water vapor content. Nowadays, water vapor products from microwave radiometers are rather consistent but important discrepancies remain. Understanding these differences can help improve the retrieval of water vapor and reduce {{at the same time the}} error on the mean sea level. Three radiometers are compared: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Jason- 1 microwave radiometer (JMR), and Envisat microwave radiometer (MWR). Water vapor products are analyzed both in terms of spatial and temporal distribution over the period 2004 – 10, using AMSR-E as a reference. The Interim ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data are also included in the study as an additional point of comparison. Overall, the study confirms the general good agreement between the radiometers: similar patterns are observed for the spatial distribution of water vapor and the correlation of the times series is better than 0. 90. However, <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> are observed and a quantitative agreement on the trend is not obtained. <b>Regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> are driven by the annual cycle.

The need for epidemiological studies dealing with unbiased populations {{in order to understand the}} causes of these observations is obvious. In Switzerland, the large majority of young men are asked to attend a military camp to be drafted into the army. A few weeks before this camp, conscripts were contacted and invited to participate in a large national study on semen quality. The participation was totally voluntary and anonymous. From September 2005 to June 2007, 770 volunteers filled out a questionnaire, underwent a clinical examination and provided sperm, blood and urine samples. Using self-rated health assessments, the observed cohort could be considered as healthy and no testicular cancer was found. Moreover, the testicular volumes, measured using Prader's orchidometry and ultrasonography, were comparable to those already published for young male populations. The median sperm concentration was 47 x 10 (6) /ml, which is close to the concentration reported in Denmark, known to have the highest incidence of testicular cancer in Europe. Statistically significant differences were observed between regions with a lower sperm concentration for men residing in the Alps (43 x 10 (6) /ml) and in the Zurich area (36 x 10 (6) /ml) compared to men from West Plateau (54 x 10 (6) /ml) and from the Jura (54 x 10 (6) /ml). Such a <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancy</b> could be related to environmental factors, including endocrine disruptors.

The research domain {{is divided into}} the coastal sea (within a 250 km region from the coastal line) and open sea (i. e., the remaining ocean). The bulk aerosol optical properties are estimated for the each region. A pair of the representative ω and g in each region is obtained through matching satellite measured aerosol radiative forcing efficiency {{with that of the}} SBDART Radiative Transfer (RT) modeling at the surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA). In the study the ω and g over the coastal sea are 0. 93 ± 0. 02 and 0. 50 ± 0. 20 and 0. 95 ± 0. 02 and 0. 56 ± 0. 18 over the open sea. For seasonal variation, both ω and g are relatively low in spring season on the other hand the values are high in summer. As one of the application of the method the radiative forcing of aerosols with the estimated optical properties over the western North Pacific are further investigated whether the aerosol optical properties of the coastal sea is considered or not. The aerosol radiative forcing in consideration of the coastal sea or not is- 34. 30 ± 2. 24 vs. - 31. 32 ± 2. 40 Wm- 2 at the surface and- 17. 75 ± 1. 27 vs. - 16. 89 ± 1. 25 Wm- 2 at the TOA, respectively. The results demonstrate that the aerosol optical properties are significantly different between in the coastal sea and open sea, which imply remarkable absorbing aerosols such as black carbon or mineral dust caused by anthropogenic and nature aerosols from continent. While previous studies have a temporal and spatial limitation to measure aerosol optical properties, the method provides a convenient solution to estimate regional and global aerosol optical properties and reduces obscurity of aerosol radiative forcing on the Earth’s energy budget...|$|E
40|$|The Tianshan and Junggar orogenic collage {{occupies}} the southwestern {{part of the}} Central Asian Orogenic Belt and was assembled by collision/accretion of several continental blocks and island arcs during late Paleozoic-early Mesozoic time, following the consumption of the Junggar and South Tianshan oceanic basins in the western segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Considerable and continuing controversy has surrounded when, where, and how this orogenic collage was eventually amalgamated, which {{plays a crucial role}} in understanding the formation of the Central Asian Orogenic Belt. This review synthesizes the most recent data and geologic evidence that place critical constraints on the closure history of the oceanic domains. A comprehensive data compilation indicates that the formation of ophiolites along major sutures in the Tianshan and Junggar region lasted to the early Carboniferous for the Kalamaili suture zone, to the mid-Carboniferous for the West Junggar region and the North Tianshan suture zone, and to the late Carboniferous for the South Tianshan suture zone. Ca. 325 - 310 Ma (ultra-) high pressure metamorphism along {{the western part of the}} South Tianshan suture occurred nearly synchronously with the collision between the Tarim Craton and the Central Tianshan-Yili Block. The oceanic closure and collision events were sequentially followed by widespread and intensive A-type granitic and bimodal magmatism, which commenced in the mid-Carboniferous along the Kalamaili belt and in the latest Carboniferous to earliest Permian in other regions. Contemporaneously, large-scale strike-slip shearing took place along major faults subparallel to main sutures, with a dominant dextral sense and deformation time since the Carboniferous-Permian transition. Available data and geological evidence support an eastward propagating, scissor-like closure of the western segment of the Paleo-Asian Ocean along the South Tianshan and North Tianshan suture zones over a period from the mid- to end Carboniferous, with the South Tianshan belt representing the final suturing site. In the early Permian, the Tarim mantle plume likely merely affected the southwestern part of the assembled Tarim and Tianshan region, as indicated by <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancy</b> in type and geochemistry of early Permian A-type granitoids.

40|$|AbstractThe crustal {{growth of}} the North China Craton (NCC) during the Neoarchean time (2. 5 – 2. 8 Ga) is a hotly {{controversial}} topic, with some proposing that the main crustal growth occurred in the late Neoarchean (2. 5 – 2. 6 Ga), {{in agreement with the}} time of the magmatism, whereas others suggest that the main crustal accretion took place during early Neoarchean time (2. 7 – 2. 8 Ga), consistent with the time of crustal-formation of other cratons in the world. Zircon U-Pb ages and Hf isotope compositions can provide rigorous constraints on the time of crustal growth and the evolution and tectonic division of the NCC. In this contribution, we make a comprehensive review of zircon Hf isotope data in combination with zircon U-Pb geochronology and some geochemistry data from various divisions of the NCC with an aim to constrain the Neoarchean crustal {{growth of the}} NCC. The results suggest that both 2. 7 – 2. 8 Ga and 2. 5 – 2. 6 Ga crustal growth are distributed over the NCC and the former is much wider than previously suggested. The Eastern block is characterized by the main 2. 7 – 2. 8 Ga crustal growth with local new crustal-formation at 2. 5 – 2. 6 Ga, and the Yinshan block is characterized by ∼ 2. 7 Ga crustal accretion as revealed by Hf-isotope data of detrital zircons from the Zhaertai Group. Detrital zircon data of the Khondalite Belt indicate that the main crustal growth period of the Western block is Paleoproterozoic involving some ∼ 2. 6 Ga and minor Early- to Middle-Archean crustal components, and the crustal accretion in the Trans-North China Orogen (TNCO) has a wide age range from 2. 5 Ga to 2. 9 Ga with a notable <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancy.</b> Zircon Hf isotope compositions, coupled with zircon ages and other geochemical data suggest that the southern margin may not be an extension of the TNCO, and the evolution and tectonic division of the NCC is more complex than previously proposed, probably involving multi-stage crustal growth and subduction processes. However, {{there is no doubt that}} 2. 7 – 2. 8 Ga magmatism and crustal-formation are more widely distributed than previously considered, which is further supported by the data of zircons from Precambrian lower crustal rocks, overlying sedimentary cover, modern river sediments and Late Neoarchean syenogranites...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{quantity}} of igneous material comprising the Siberian Traps provides a uniquely excellent opportunity to constrain Earth’s paleomagnetic field intensity at the Permo-Triassic boundary. There remains however, a contradiction about {{the strength of}} the magnetic field that is exacerbated by the limited number of measurement data. To clarify the geomagnetic field behavior during this time period, for the first time, a microwave paleointensity study has been carried out on the Permo-Triassic flood basalts in order to complement existing datasets obtained using conventional thermal techniques. Samples, which have been dated at ∼ 250 Ma, of the Permo-Triassic trap basalts from the northern extrusive (Maymecha-Kotuy region) and the southeastern intrusive (areas of the Sytikanskaya and Yubileinaya kimberlite pipes) localities on the Siberian platform are investigated. These units have already demonstrated reliable paleomagnetic directions consistent with the retention of a primary remanence. Furthermore, Scanning Electron Microscope analysis confirms the presence of iron oxides likely of primary origin. Microwave Thellier-type paleointensity experiments (IZZI protocol with partial thermoremanent magnetization checks) are performed on 50 samples from 11 sites, of which, 28 samples from 7 sites provide satisfactory paleointensity data. The samples display corresponding distinct directional components, positive pTRM checks and little or no zig-zagging of the Arai or Zijderveld plot, providing evidence to support that the samples are not influenced by lab-induced alteration or multi-domain behavior. The accepted microwave paleointensity results from this study are combined with thermal Thellier-type results from previously published studies to obtain overall estimates for different regions of the Siberian Traps. The mean geomagnetic field intensity obtained from the samples of the northern part is 13. 4 ± 12. 7 μT (Maymecha-Kotuy region), whereas from the southeastern part is 17. 3 ± 16. 5 μT (Sytikanskaya kimberlite pipe) and 48. 5 ± 7. 3 μT (Yubileinaya kimberlite pipe), suggesting that the <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancy</b> is probably due to the insufficient sampling of geomagnetic secular variation, and thus, multiple localities need to be considered to obtain an accurate paleomagnetic dipole moment for this time period. It demonstrates that the overall mean paleointensity of the Siberian Traps is 19. 5 ± 13. 0 μT which corresponds to a mean virtual dipole moment of 3. 2 ± 1. 8 × 1022 Am 2. Results indicate that the average magnetic field intensity during Permo-Triassic boundary is significantly lower (by approximately 50 %) than the present geomagnetic field intensity, and thus, it implies that the Mesozoic dipole low might extend 50 Myr further back in time than previously recognized...|$|E

We achieved best model results with the consolidation thickness parameterization developed by Biggs and others (2000). Observed <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> between model and satellite estimates might be a consequence of the missing representation of the dynamic of the thin-ice thickening (e. g. rafting). We conclude that this simplified polynya model is a valuable tool for studying polynya dynamics and estimating associated fluxes of single polynya event...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years the Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has become a phenomenon, which is {{nowadays}} considered {{to be one of the}} major future perspectives of an economy. For many economists and politicians, the FDI is perceived as a saving instrument, which should help solve problems such as structure, <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> and most importantly a high unemployment rate especially under the conditions of global economic and financial crisis. The inflow of the FDI to host economy brings many positive effects that cannot be substituted. In fact, it is considered as a positive externality that must be paid. In order to attract the FDI in a country, the investment incentives are proposed and current incentives are being rebuilt. But attracting FDI at all costs can also be counterproductive. The intended aim of this thesis is to analyze positive and negativ effects of the FDI...|$|R
40|$|The ageing {{process of}} populations due to {{demographic}} change affects {{the economy in}} various ways. The study at hand focuses on the reallocation of income and changes in consumption expenses caused by demographic change. Local disparities on NUTS 3 level are of special interest as the demographic effects can vary considerably between regions depending on their initial position such as population density, age structure, and economic condition. By means of data for the regions of North-Rhine-Westphalia (Germany) a dynamic purchasing power indicator is built that takes the development of different age groups into account and gives a first impression {{of the effects of}} ageing on the development of income and consumption behaviour. <b>Regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> can be identified. While some regions are characterised by a static income situation, i. e. a more or less age independent development, others show distinct increases/decreases in their income caused by their specific structure of demographic change...|$|R
40|$|The 2017 Global NGO Online Technology Report is a {{research}} project that seeks {{to gain a better}} understanding of how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) worldwide use online technology to engage their supporters and donors. Sponsored by the Public Interest Registry and researched by Nonprofit Tech for Good, the report summarizes how NGOs worldwide use web and email communications, online and mobile fundraising tools, and social and mobile media. The report is groundbreaking in that it is the only annual research project dedicated to studying how NGOs use online technology on a global scale. Due to <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> in the global Internet infrastructure, how effectively NGOs utilize online technology to inspire philanthropy and create social change varies greatly depending upon their location. Each year as more NGOs participate in the research, the report becomes more precise in its findings and useful to the global NGO sector...|$|R
40|$|Statistics on the {{registration}} of blind and partially-sighted patients in Northern Ireland underestimate the true extent {{of visual impairment}} within our community. In comparison to other UK regions, where between 0. 53 % and 0. 59 % of the population avail of blind or partial sight registration, only 0. 35 % of residents in Northern Ireland appear on the respective registers. Most patients on the combined registers are in the older age groups and many also suffer from other disabilities. <b>Regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> {{may be attributed to}} a combination of factors including: patient attitudes to {{the registration}} process, medical attitudes to registration and local anomalies {{in the way in which}} social services departments both record and present annual registration returns. Better liaison is necessary between the community, hospital and voluntary sector providers to improve identification and support services for the visually impaired in the future...|$|R
40|$|A global {{database}} of nitrogen isotope data from marine sediments is presented, including both seafloor and sub-seafloor sediment samples. The data synthesis reveals regionally and globally consistent patterns and trends, with good agreement between neighbouring seafloor sites. The spatial coverage of seafloor δ 15 N data is heterogenous, with excellent {{coverage in the}} eastern tropical Pacific, South China Sea and Arabian Sea, while large regions of the globe remain unsampled. The sub-seafloor δ 15 N records are mostly from the late Pleistocene, with > 90 coeval records during the last ~ 10 kiloyears (kyr), before which the number of records at any time decreases, with 15 N measurements within a 100 km radius, which suggest a reliable translation of sediments into the buried sediment record. We suggest that <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> between seafloor and late Holocene subseafloor δ 15 N indicate nitrogen cycle changes during the late Holocene period, rather than systematic diagenetic changes...|$|R
50|$|Data {{taken from}} the OECD website show that {{industrial}} employment in Belgium rose between 1999 and 2000 and then declined until 2003, rising again until 2006. The overall trend in industrial employment in Belgium, however, is still a decline. OECD data also shows that production and sales of total industry in Belgium {{has been on the}} rise since 1955, with the exception of small declines during a few years. Despite this trend, deindustrialisation is occurring at fairly rapid rates in Belgium. Variables such as large population increases and <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> account for these misleading statistics. Deindustrialisation is hitting the region of Wallonia much harder than the region of Flanders. Wallonia remains much more impoverished and has an unemployment rate of about 17% (twice that of the unemployment rate in Flanders). Other statistics displaying the effects of deindustrialisation in Belgium is the rise in employment in the service sector from 1999 until 2006. Today, industry is much less significant in Belgium {{than it has been in}} previous years.|$|R
40|$|Immunoglobulin A {{nephropathy}} (IgAN) is {{the most}} common type of primary glomerulonephritis, which is characterized by IgA 1 -containing immune-deposits in the glomerular mesangium. The epidemiologic observations of familial clustering as well as ethnic and <b>regional</b> <b>discrepancies</b> indicate a genetic component to IgAN. Large, international, genome-wide association studies have identified several susceptibility genes and loci for IgAN, many of which have been implicated in immune regulation and are shared with other autoimmune diseases. Notably, increasing numbers of genes involved in mucosal immunity have been detected; such genes may impact the susceptibility and progression of IgAN through interaction with environmental stimuli (especially infection). Here, we discuss the innate and adaptive immune mechanisms that drive protective immunity against pathogens. Our goal is to provide a representative overview of the synergistic roles between genetic predisposition and infection in IgAN pathogenesis. We anticipate that these results will provide potential therapeutic agents and advances in precision medicine...|$|R
