5|$|Lucy only {{appears in}} the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in {{mourning}} for her, and the <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> drawn into this mutual sorrow.|$|E
5|$|García Márquez {{was also}} noted for leaving out {{seemingly}} important details and events so the <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> {{forced into a}} more participatory role in the story development. For example, in No One Writes to the Colonel, the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as Antigone and Oedipus Rex, in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.|$|E

The novels were each written by British science-fiction writer David Wingrove with assistance from Mysts creators, Rand and Robyn Miller.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert White's Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne (1789) holds {{a unique}} {{position}} in English literature as the solitary classic of natural history. It {{is not easy to}} give, in a few words, a reason for its remarkable success. It is, in fact, not so much a logically arranged and systematic book as an invaluable record of the life work of a simple and refined man who succeeded in picturing himself as well as what he saw. The <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> carried along by his interest in the results of far-sighted observation; but, more than this, the reader imbibes the spirit of the writer which pervades the whole book and endears it to like-minded naturalists as a valued companion.|$|E
5|$|The first {{character}} {{introduced to}} the <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> a girl named Lola, who shares a college dormitory room with five other girls, including the narrator. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts {{to escape from the}} totalitarian world of school and society. She rides the buses at night and has brutish, anonymous sex with men returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first part of the book ends when Lola is found dead, hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase.|$|E

5|$|The <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> {{forced to}} {{question}} {{the stability of the}} Hackee union: Chippy stays away from home long after Timmy's situation is resolved and returns to his wife only after being frightened from the tree by a bear entirely superfluous to the tale. At home, Chippy suffers with a head cold, but Mrs. Hackee's lack of expression in the illustration leaves the reader wondering how she took his abrupt return. One wonders why Mrs. Hackee did not pursue Chippy once she learned of his whereabouts from a bird. After the reader discovers Goody is the happy mother of triplets and Timmy has made the decision to keep his nuts under lock and key, he may wonder what sort of fate the future holds for the Hackees.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the story {{provides}} an anthropological view of the culture of the Tombs, and through them, of the Kargish lands as a whole. The <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> shown that the true names of people have no particular significance in the Kargish lands, whereas in the Archipelago they grant power over the thing being named; nonetheless, the critical moment in which Tenar recalls her true name has been described as influencing other works such as Hayao Miyazaki's 2001 film Spirited Away. Scholars have described Le Guin's depiction of Kargish culture as a subtle critique, particularly of the powers of the Tombs, which give nothing in return for their worship. Much of the {{early part of}} the novel describes the life that Tenar leads in the stable world of the Tombs. Ged's arrival acts as a turning point, and the rest of the book explores the possibility of change, and introduces different perspectives on the internal world of the novel.|$|E

5|$|With Hagrid's help, Harry {{prepares for}} and {{undertakes}} {{his first year}} of study at Hogwarts. As Harry begins to explore the magical world, the <b>reader</b> <b>is</b> introduced {{to many of the}} primary locations used throughout the series. Harry meets most of the main characters and gains his two closest friends: Ron Weasley, a fun-loving member of an ancient, large, happy, but poor wizarding family, and Hermione Granger, a gifted, bright, and hardworking witch of non-magical parentage. Harry also encounters the school's potions master, Severus Snape, who displays a conspicuously deep and abiding dislike for him, the rich brat Draco Malfoy whom he quickly makes enemies with, and the Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Quirinus Quirrell, who later turns out to be allied with Lord Voldemort. He also discovers a talent of flying on broomsticks and is recruited for his house's Quidditch team, a sport in the wizarding world where players fly on broomsticks. The first book concludes with Harry's second confrontation with Lord Voldemort, who, in his quest to regain a body, yearns to gain the power of the Philosopher's Stone, a substance that bestows everlasting life and turns any metal into pure gold.|$|E
