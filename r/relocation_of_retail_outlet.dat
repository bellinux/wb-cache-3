40|$|The study {{identifies}} {{differences in}} consumer characteristics and {{the selection of}} the type <b>of</b> a <b>retail</b> <b>outlet</b> in pecan purchases. Within the framework of utility maximization, an empirical model is specified and estimated using multinomial logit. The estimation is based on data collected through a nationwide survey. Calculated marginal probabilities show the importance of age, household income, and household size among the important consumer characteristics that influence the selection <b>of</b> a <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> Employment and the timing of pecan purchases also influence the use of a specific type <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> In particular, mail-order purchases are made by older persons with higher incomes and larger households in comparison to purchases at grocery stores or other outlets. The study provides knowledge needed to improve marketing strategies for different outlets and suggests that various strategies can be developed to reach different groups of pecan buyers by type <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> Consumer/Household Economics,...|$|R

40|$|We {{research}} the management approach that quantitatively combines {{decisions that affect}} different planning horizons [...] namely, the strategic and operational ones [...] and simultaneously derive the optimal values of these decisions. The system we investigate comprises <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers in an infinite-horizon setting. Both <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to determine the optimal values of the number <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the location <b>of</b> each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet,</b> and the replenishment inventory levels maintained at each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> We analyze the system from an expected cost point of view, considering the fixed costs <b>of</b> operating the <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented {{as a function of}} the number <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> Moreover, we show that the system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these decisions at once. We show the advantage of our approach on both the solution and objective spaces. We propose an exact quantification of this advantage in terms of the cost and problem parameters. In addition, we point out several managerial insights. location-inventory model, implicit function theorem, risk pooling, infinite-horizon stochastic inventory, subadditive function, quasi-convex...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} a modelling system to simulate urban freight flows and preliminary results of a survey carried out to investigate end-consumer behaviour. The set of models involves the simulation of end-consumer choices in relation to type <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlet</b> (e. g. small, medium or large) since such choices undoubtedly impact on freight distribution flows. Indeed, the characteristics of the restocking process are strictly related to the type <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> activities to be restocked in terms of delivery size, delivery frequency, freight vehicle type and so on. The paper details each model for shopping mobility origin-destination matrix estimation and investigates the main variables affecting behaviour in relation to trip generation and type <b>of</b> <b>retail</b> <b>outlet...</b>|$|R
