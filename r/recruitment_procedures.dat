Individualizing the lung <b>recruitment</b> <b>procedure</b> to the severity of lung disease of each patient might reduce these risks. In this prospective cohort study, we evaluated chest X-ray (CXR) characteristics during individualized oxygenation-guided lung recruitment with HFV in preterm infants with RDS, before and after surfactant therapy. Two pediatric radiologists scored radiolucency, the presence of lung hyperinflation, and/or air leaks following lung recruitment during HFV in 69 infants before and 39 infants after surfactant treatment. Following lung recruitment, the median radiolucency score was 2, with 44 (64 %) infants having a score ≤ 2. Only mild to moderate hyperinflation was seen in 13 (19 %) infants, with no air leaks. After the surfactant, the radiolucency score improved in 62 % of 39 paired CXRs (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). Mild to moderate hyperinflation was seen in nine (24 %) patients. During the entire admission, only four (6 %) of the patients developed air leaks.
