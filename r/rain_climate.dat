In the late 1980 s, the earliest detailed micrometeorological measurements in central Amazonian rainforests in Brazil produced measurements confirming global models that showed a net increase in temperature due to declining cooling caused {{by the loss of}} evaporation (Shuttleworth 1988; Gash and Shuttleworth 1991).

40|$|International audienceEl Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an {{important}} element of earth's ocean-climate system. To further understand its past variability, proxy records from climate archives need to be studied. Ice cores from high alpine glaciers may contain high resolution ENSO proxy information, given the glacier site is climatologically sensitive to ENSO. We investigated signals of ENSO in the climate of the subtropical Andes in the proximity of Cerro Tapado glacier (30 ° 08 ' S, 69 ° 55 ' W, 5550 m a. s. l.), where a 36 m long ice core was drilled in 1999 (Ginot, 2001). We used annual and semi-annual precipitation and temperature time series from regional meteorological stations and interpolated grids for correlation analyses with ENSO indices and ice core-derived proxies (net accumulation, stable isotope ratio ? 18 O, major ion concentrations). The total time period investigated here comprises 1900 to 2000, but varies with data sets. Only in the western, i. e. Mediterranean Andes precipitation is higher (lower) during El Niño (La Niña) events, especially at higher altitudes, due to the latitudinal shift of frontal activity during austral winters. However, the temperature response to ENSO is more stable in space and time, being higher (lower) during El Niño (La Niña) events in most of the subtropical Andes all year long. From a northwest to southeast teleconnection gradient, we suggest a regional water vapour feedback triggers temperature anomalies as a function of ENSO-related changes in regional pressure systems, Pacific sea surface temperature and tropical moisture input. Tapado glacier ice proxies are found to be predominantly connected to eastern Andean summer <b>rain</b> <b>climate,</b> which contradicts previous studies and the modern mean spatial boundary between subtropical summer and winter <b>rain</b> <b>climate</b> derived from the grid data. The only ice core proxy showing a response to ENSO is the major ion concentrations, via local temperature indicating reduced sublimation and mineral dust input during El Niño years...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{reviews the}} {{long-term}} effects of past, present and future air pollution and climate on the decay of stones from historic buildings. It summarizes the historical effects as well as causes and consequences of damage. The most significant change in terms of pollution has been a shift from high levels of sulphate deposition from coal burning to a blackening process dominated by diesel soot and nitrogen deposition from vehicular sources in cities. Black-ening of light-coloured fabric eventually reaches apoint where it becomes publicly unacceptable. Public opinion can assist the development of aesthetic thresholds and derive limit values for elemental carbon in urban air. Public perception is also affected by the pattern of blackening. This century new climate regimes will cause dramatic hanges in blackening patterns by wind-driven <b>rain.</b> <b>Climate</b> changes, most particularly changes in temperature, humidity stress and time of wetness, can also affect the weathering of stone in terms of responses to frost and soluble salts.

40|$|Year to year {{variations}} in the cumulative distributions of rain rate or rain attenuation are evident {{in any of the}} published measurements for a single propagation path that span a period of several years of observation. These variations must be described by models for the prediction of rain attenuation statistics. Now that a large measurement data base has been assembled by the International Radio Consultative Committee, the information needed to assess variability is available. On the basis of 252 sample cumulative distribution functions for the occurrence of attenuation by rain, the expected year to year variation in attenuation at a fixed probability level in the 0. 1 to 0. 001 percent of a year range is estimated to be 27 percent. The expected deviation from an attenuation model prediction for a single year of observations is estimated to exceed 33 percent when any of the available global <b>rain</b> <b>climate</b> model are employed to estimate the rain rate statistics.

30|$|The {{results suggest}} clearly {{differentiated}} development paths of all varieties. All varieties show {{a significant positive}} trend {{until the end of}} the century, though the medium variety also shows a significant decline of 5 % during the first 30 years and only a slight recovery towards + 5 % around the century’s end. The late variety has the clearest and strongest positive trend, with peaks of more than + 30 % increase of biomass yields and around 25 % average increase in the last three decades. The early variety can be seen as in-between, with no negative but also not an as-strong positive development path. All varieties have their strongest increase after the mid of the 21 st century. Statistical evaluation of these results suggests that the shift from a summer rain to a winter <b>rain</b> <b>climate</b> in Germany will be the main limiting factor for all varieties. In addition, summer temperatures will become less optimal for all maize crops.

It ends by making recommendations for effective health, safety, and environmental (HSE) management. Review of the literature showed that contusion (bruise), cuts, and laceration are the commonest occupational injuries that workers on the oil rig suffer and that the injuries mostly affect the hand and finger, leg, and eyes of the offshore workers. These injuries were found to be caused mostly by direct stroke, jamming and overstrain. Similarly, accidental poisoning, musculoskeletal disorders, respiratory disorders and diseases of the digestive system were also documented as the commonest occupational diseases among offshore workers. The literature also shows that working offshore is associated with poorer psychological wellbeing or health; this is to say that offshore workers tend to experience higher levels of stress, burnout, anxiety, depression, low job satisfaction (particularly with the environmental conditions associated with their work), and sleep disorders. Finally, the literature review indicated that land-use problems, air pollution, acid <b>rain,</b> <b>climate</b> change, habitat disruption, environmental degradation, oil spills and leakages are some of environmental impacts of upstream oil production.
