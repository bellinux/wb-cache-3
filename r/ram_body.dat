40|$|Abstract: The social rank {{refers to}} the {{relative}} position of an individual animal within the dominant hierarchy developed in a group. In rams, social rank is mostly associated with body mass, body size and body condition. However, although the body mass is generally considered {{as one of the}} main determinants of social rank, only few studies have been carried out for the purpose of associating of the social behaviour and body development of these animals. Objective of this research was to determine how the <b>ram</b> <b>body</b> development measures relate to establishment of social hierarchy. Social rank was established using food competition test at the age of animals between 4 and 17 months. Testing was done on total of 20 male animals of which number 12 animals were selected for further testing (6 dominant and 6 submissive animals). Body mass and testicular circumferences were measured at the age of 4, 7, 12 and 18 months, and linear body measures were taken at the age of 12 and 18 months. Dominant males had higher body mass and greater testicular circumference. The social rank had no significant effect on linear body measures of rams, except for chest girth (P< 0. 05...|$|E

Hydroulics ram has so many advantages, doesn’t need electrical energy, fuel, lubrication, low cost and easy proccess in production and maintenence. Hydraulic ram works {{on the principle of}} water hammer. When a flowing liquid is suddenly brought to rest, the change in momentumof liquid mass causes a sudden rise in pressure. This rise in pressure is utilised to raise a portion of the liquid to higher levels. To fullfill the people needs of water in the upland and highly, the designer makes this. This research tries to find the optimum angle of valve when it’s open and the mass of valve to rises the efficiency of hydroulics ram.

40|$|During {{a routine}} flock visit, a farmer {{observed}} {{that one of}} the eight tooth Bapedi rams had been losing body condition despite being separated from the flock and fed supplementary feed. The <b>ram’s</b> <b>body</b> condition score was assessed as 2 out of 5 (one point less than the average {{of the rest of the}} rams) and the teeth appeared normal with no excessive wear. The rumen was assessed by auscultation, palpation and ballottement where a foreign body (approximately 20 cm × 5 cm – 10 cm) was clearly palpated and ballotted. A rumenotomy was performed and a large mass of tightly compacted foreign matter and plant material was removed. The mass consisted of synthetic fibre, plant material and calcium phosphate (50. 5 %). It appeared to have formed as the result of the ingestion of a synthetic fibre which formed the nidus of a concretion. This was probably the result of deficient nutrition, with the rams eating the synthetic fibre in an attempt to increase feed intake. The ram recovered uneventfully after the rumenotomy was performed and supplementary feeding.

A similar ray morphology phenotype was observed in males harboring mutations in three previously defined genes, dpy- 11, dpy- 18 and sqt- 1, that also affect body shape. One of these genes, sqt- 1, is known to encode a collagen. Mutations in different ram genes failed to complement, from which we infer that their gene products functionally interact. For one ram gene, failure to complement was shown to result from haploinsufficiency. Intergenic noncomplementation did not extend to the body morphology genes. The temperature-sensitive periods of both <b>ram</b> and <b>body</b> morphology mutations corresponded to the period of development in which ray extension occurs.

Twelve <b>ram</b> average <b>body</b> weight 20. 65 + 1. 89 kg, CV = 9. 15 %, and age ranged from 12 to 18 months were used in this study. Rams were daily fed pelleted diet at 5 % of body weight (BW) in 100 % dry matter base. Animals were assigned to Completely Randomized Design and divided into three groups for different feeding time treatments. The treatments were day feeding time (feeding allowed from 0600 to 1800; T 0618), night feeding (from 1800 to 0600; T 1806) and whole-day feeding (24 h; T 0606), respectively. Parameters observed in this study were duration of eating, rumination, rest, standing and laying activity (minute/day), dry matter intake (DMI, g/day) and eating speed (g/minute). Collected data were analyzed using ANOVA with F-test and if significantly was found were then analyzed with Duncan test. The results showed that eating duration (89. 71 min/day) and DMI (1034. 53 g/day) on T 1806 were significantly lower (P< 0. 05) than T 0618 (117. 78 min/day; 1208. 75 g/day) and T 0606 (127. 5 min/day; 1281. 63 g/day) but, the other observation of ruminating, rest, standing and laying duration and eating speed were found not significantly different in the all treatments.

Body weight, average daily gain, body condition score, body length, withers height and chest girth in sixty first cross Merino lambs sired by White Suffolk and Poll Dorset rams were measured fortnightly over a ten-week period. Generalised linear model procedure in SAS was used for statistical analysis and included the fixed effects of sire breed, sex, fortnight and their second order interactions. Duncan's Multiple Range Test, correlations between growth and conformation traits and Bonferroni probabilities were estimated and used for comparisons.

The rams were divided into 2 groups, CON (n = 10; control) and multiple stressors (MS; n = 10; multiple stressors). All of the rams were stall fed with a diet consisting of 70 % roughage and 30 % concentrate. The CON rams were maintained in a shed under ambient conditions with ad libitum feeding without walking, whereas MS rams were subjected to multiple stressors (thermal, nutritional, and walking). The feed intake (P < 0. 01) was lower and water intake (P < 0. 01) was higher in MS compared to CON rams. Among the physiological measurements, respiration rate afternoon (P < 0. 01), pulse rate morning (P < 0. 01), rectal temperature afternoon (P < 0. 01), skin temperature afternoon (P < 0. 05), and both morning and afternoon scrotum temperature (P < 0. 01) increased significantly in MS rams.

40|$|ABSTRACT This work {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the relationship between echogenicity, testicular biometry, and accessory gland biometry and evaluate the echogenicity pattern of these structures in Santa Ines rams. Fifty-four healthy Santa Ines sheep were classified into three age groups: group 1 - 3 to 5 months (pre-pubertal); group 2 - 7 to 11 months (pubertal); and group 3 - 13 to 28 months (sexually mature). The averages of testicular biometry and bulbourethral gland biometry were different among age groups. The testicular parenchyma was homogeneous with low echogenicity (pre-pubertal group) and medium echogenicity (pubertal and sexually mature groups), suggesting that testicular echogenicity can be a helpful tool to identify the start of puberty. The accessory glands were heterogeneous with low echogenicity in all age groups. Correlations were high between weight, biometry of testis and of bulbourethral gland and echogenicity of the accessory glands, indicating that sexually mature <b>rams</b> with higher <b>body</b> development have larger testicles and larger glands. We recommend the use of testicular biometry as a complementary evaluation of the reproductive efficiency of Santa Ines rams. The average values of echogenicity and the biometry of accessory glands are important parameters to assist the selection of breeding rams...|$|R

50|$|Unicron's body is {{inactive}} {{and badly}} damaged from his previous battle. Ten years after Galvatron's sacrifice a former victim of Unicron chooses to strike. Within Unicron's shell, the Spark of Alpha Q, ruler of Planet Q, which Unicron had {{consumed in the}} past, still exists. From Unicron's body he creates the Terrorcons to gather Energon, which he intends to use to regenerate all the worlds Unicron devoured. However, Megatron's corpse and Spark remain within Unicron, and slowly siphon {{off some of the}} gathered Energon, allowing him to be reborn in a new body through the unintentional actions of Scorponok. Hunted by Megatron, Alpha-Q then jettisons Unicron's head and escapes in it. Megatron takes over Unicron's body and continues to gather Energon in order to rebuild Unicron to use as a weapon. A joint attack by Alpha-Q, the Autobots, and their human allies sees all of Earth's Energon channeled into Unicron's head, which Alpha-Q then <b>rams</b> into Unicron's <b>body.</b> The positively charged Energon of Earth reacts with the negatively charged Energon running through Unicron. It tears open a fissure in reality leading to a new area of space where planets Unicron consumed are recreated and sustained through the Energon radiated from Unicron's head, which is now a glowing red sun.|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of adding slow-release urea to replace conventional urea in the diet on carcass characteristics of feedlot sheep. We used 20 Santa Ines x SRD <b>rams,</b> with average <b>body</b> weight of 21. 1 ± 1. 2 kg and average age of 120 days, distributed in a completely randomized design with 5 treatments. The replacement levels used as treatments were 0, 20, 40, 60, and 80 %, composing diets of about 12 % crude protein, with 50 % Tifton- 85 hay and 50 % concentrate. There was no influence of slow release urea on weight at slaughter (35. 17 kg), and on hot (16. 75 kg) and cold (16. 24 kg) carcass weight, but the yield of these carcasses showed quadratic trend, revealing lower percentages at 48. 5 and 47. 63 % replacement levels, respectively. The weights and yields of cuts did not change, except for the posterior arm, whose values showed a cubic trend. Objective measures of carcass, loin eye area, and subjective evaluations of conformation, finishing and marbling of carcasses were not affected. The subcutaneous fat thickness decreased linearly (4. 25 to 2. 48 mm). The inclusion of slow release urea in the diet changes the yield and reduces subcutaneous fat, however, it does not influence other carcass characteristics...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the effect of dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) and fish oil supplementations on dry matter intake (DMI), dry matter digestibility (DMD) and organic matter digestibility (OMD), weight gain, {{as well as the}} acidity of urine in Garut breed rams. The experiment was done based on randomized group design with 6 treatments and 3 groups. The dietary treatments were as follows: R 0 = basal ration (DCAD + 14) without fish oil, R 1 = basal ration (DCAD + 14) with 3 % fish oil, R 2 = base ration (DCAD + 40) without fish oil, R 3 = base ration (DCAD + 40) with 3 % fish oil, R 4 = acid ration (DCAD - 40) without fish oil, and R 5 = acid ration (DCAD - 40) with 3 % fish oil. All rations contained 150 ppm of zinc and were offered to 18 of Garut breed rams. The results indicated that DCAD + 40 and - 40 decreased DMI significantly. The ration with DCAD + 40 had the lowest DMI. Fish oil supplementation decreased DMI. No differences were observed for DMD and OMD. DCAD + 40 and - 40 decreased <b>body</b> weight of <b>rams.</b> However, the <b>body</b> weight of <b>rams</b> was very low. Variation of urine pH followed the DCAD pattern.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the influence of body weight and feeding level on the change of body composition of indigenous ram. This research was expected to establish the efficient feeding level to produce high growth rate and meat quality of ram in tropical environment. Sixteen <b>rams</b> with different <b>body</b> weight (BW) were divided into 2 groups, i. e. light BW (10 + 1. 47 kg) and heavy BW (18 + 1. 18 kg). The experimental design was Split Plot design with two factors. The main plot was body weight (light and heavy) and the sub plot was level of feeding (FL, 1 x maintenance and 1. 5 x maintenance). The parameters measured in this experiment were live weight gain and body composition. The results of this study showed that body water, body protein and body fat were significantly higher (P< 0. 01) in heavy body weight (HBW) than those in light body weight (LBW), and was higher in 1. 5 xM than those 1 xM. Ram of HW and LW had similar change rate of physical composition. Ram given 1. 5 xM had higher rate of change of body fat and body water than those given feed at maintenance level. It can be concluded that there was no interaction between BW and FL on the change of body water, body protein and <b>body</b> fat. <b>Ram</b> of HBW and LBW had similar rate of change of physical composition. Level of feeding affected body water content, the higher level of feeding resulted in fatter ram, leading to less body water content.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Embryonic loss of {{potential}} lambs resulting in partial failure of multiple ovulations {{is a significant}} factor in the reproductive rate of prolific breeds. The roles of genetic and nutritional variation (and their possible interaction) on embryonic loss were studied by mating blackface and whiteface ewes of either high or low body condition to either Suffolk or Polypay <b>rams.</b> Variation in <b>body</b> condition was created by placing ewes on either high or low planes of nutrition for 13 weeks prior to breeding and the first 30 days of pregnancy with the goal of achieving mean body condition scores of 4. 0 and 2. 5, respectively. Low ewes were flushed to overcome expected depression in ovulation rate due to poor body condition. The actual difference achieved was 1. 0 condition score units (and 11 kg) at the commencement of mating. Embryo loss was defined as difference between ovulation rate as measured by laparoscopy shortly post-mating, and litter size at term. Mean ovulation rate for ewes conceiving to first estrus was 2. 34 for whiteface ewes and 2. 02 for blackface ewes (p<. 05). Mean ovulation rates for High and Low ewes were 2. 10 and 2. 20, respectively (p=. 32). The potential role for progesterone insufficiency during critical times in early gestation was assessed from plasma samples collected at days 13 and 20 of gestation, and analyzed from ewes exhibiting embryo loss and contemporary ewes without loss. There was no evidence that genotype of either ewes or embryos, nutritional status, or progesterone levels had an effect on uterine efficiency in either twin- or triple-ovulating ewes. Plasma progesterone concentrations were affected by a genotype by ovulation rate interaction at both day 13 (p=. 04) and at day 20 levels (p<. 01). Day 20 concentrations were also affected by a genotype by litter size interaction (p<. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{comprised}} of field survey, agronomic trial, laboratory and animal evaluation of desho grass. A total of 240 households (hh) {{were involved in}} the field survey conducted to assess the status of desho grass production and utilization in Burie Zuria and Doyogena districts, with the use of pre-tested and semi- structured questionnaire. The grass was planted at mid and highland altitudes using vegetative root splits in randomized complete block design {{to determine the effects of}} altitude and harvesting dates (90, 120 and 150 days after planting) on morphology, dry matter (DM) yield and chemical composition of desho grass. Feeding & digestibility trials were conducted using 25 Washera yearling <b>rams</b> with mean <b>body</b> weight of 19. 4 + 1. 89 kg in randomized complete block design to evaluate the feed potential of desho grass as a basal diet. The dietary treatments studied were; 100 % Natural Pasture Hay (NPH) (T 1), 75 % NPH+ 25 % Desho Grass Hay (DGH) (T 2), 50 % NPH + 50 % DGH (T 3), 25 % NPH+ 75 % DGH (T 4), and 100 % DGH (T 5). All the treatment groups were supplemented with 300 g/h DM of concentrate & data on feed intake, daily body weight gain, feed conversion efficiency & fecal samples were collected during the 90 and 7 days of feeding and digestibility trial respectively. The field survey data were analyzed with the help of descriptive statistics and probit model using SAS 9. 2. The agronomic characteristics and laboratory analytical data were subjected to two-way ANOVA and correlation analysis of SAS 9. 2. Animal evaluation data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA of SAS. Tukey’s Honest Significant Test was used to separate means that showed significant difference. The results of the field survey revealed that the mean landholding, livestock holding and family size of the respondents was 0. 95 hectare, 3. 56 tropical livestock units and 6. 5 persons/hh, respectively. The proportion of farmers who use desho grass as a feed were 60 % and 35 % use it for more than one purpose including feed. About 42, 3 and 53 % of the respondents reported that they feed desho grass to lactating cattle, small ruminants and to all livestock species respectively. There was significant positive correlation (P< 0. 01) between experience of desho grass production practice and utilization for different purposes in the study areas. About 43 % of desho grass producers have received training on desho grass production and utilization. The utilization of the grass for many purposes is not well practiced by many farmers, due to in adequate extension services and lack of training. The results of the agronomic trials indicated that leaf length per plant (LLPP) of the grass planted in mid altitude (28. 98 cm) was greater than that (21. 81 cm) planted in the high altitude. Highest harvesting date significantly increased (P< 0. 05) plant height (PH), number of tillers per plant (NTPP), number of leaves per plant (NLPP), leaf length per plant (LLPP) and re-growth dates (RGD). The DM yield of desho grass significantly increased, while crude protein (CP) content significantly decreased (P< 0. 05) as the harvesting date increased from 90 to 150 days. Agronomic results xviii revealed that desho grass performs well both in mid and high altitude areas and represent potential livestock feed resource at early stage (90 to 120 days after planting) of feeding. The daily DM intake and mean daily body gain of the experimental sheep showed significant improvement (P< 0. 05) with increased level of inclusion of desho grass into the basal ration. The digestibility coefficient of DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF were significantly different (P< 0. 05) among the treatments (in the order of T 1 <T 2 <T 3 <T 4 <T 5). The result of the feeding trial indicated that desho grass hay could safely be included at 50 - 100 % into small ruminant basal ration at the expense of natural pasture hay in Ethiopia. The grass performed well in both mid and highlands, multifunctional in use and appropriate for smallholder farming systems of the country...|$|R
