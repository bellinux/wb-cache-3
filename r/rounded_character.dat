500|$|To make Bond a more <b>rounded</b> <b>character,</b> Fleming put further {{aspects of}} his {{personality}} into his creation. The journalist and writer Matthew Parker observes that Bond's [...] "physical and mental ennui" [...] {{is a reflection of}} Fleming's poor health and low spirits when he wrote the book. Following on from the character development of Bond in his previous four novels, Fleming adds further background to Bond's private life, largely around his home life and personal habits, with Bond's introduction to the story seeing him at breakfast with his housekeeper, May. The novelist Raymond Benson—who later wrote a series of Bond novels—sees aspects of self-doubt entering Bond's mind with the [...] "soft" [...] life he has been leading when he is introduced in the book. Benson identifies Bond's fear when the flight to Istanbul encounters severe turbulence from a storm, [...] and notes Bond's apparent [...] nervousness when he first meets Romanova; [...] he seems concerned and guilty about his mission. The other characters in the book are also well developed, according to Benson. He considers that the head of the Turkish office, Darko Kerim Bey, is [...] "one of Fleming's more colourful characters"; Kerim is a similar type of dependable and appealing ally that Fleming also created with Quarrel (in Live and Let Die) and Colombo (in the short story [...] "Risico"). Parker considers that Kerim is [...] "an antidote" [...] to Bond's lethargy, while the essayist Umberto Eco sees the character as having some of the moral qualities of the villains in the series, but that those qualities are used in support of Bond.|$|E

The plant was originally described by the son of Carolus Linnaeus, Carl Linnaeus the Younger The original description was published in Supplementum Plantarum in 1782. The generic epithet, Vitex, is derived from the Latin viere, meaning “to bind or twist” in reference to the rope-like stems produced by some species in the genus. The specific epithet, rotundifolia, is derived from the Latin rotundus, which means [...] "round, spherical", and folium, meaning [...] "leaf.” This is a reference to the <b>rounded</b> <b>character</b> of the leaves.|$|E

In an interview with entertainment website Digital Spy, Attwater said the character is strong-minded, going on to say: [...] "He's a boxer, he wins in the ring and he has a way with the ladies. He can talk most into bed! That's his strong attribute! Leon's mum died when he was young, and that was a big thing for him. His relationship with his father's quite rocky, so I think that's where his weakness lies, in his family life. He tries to push that away as much as possible."

2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Washington Post, Gary Arnold called the film [...] "a wretched excess." [...] Jay Scott, {{in his review}} for the Globe and Mail, called the film [...] "a hell of an {{antidote}} to E.T." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "Astonishingly, Carpenter blows it. There's {{a big difference between}} shock effects and suspense, and in sacrificing everything at the altar of gore, Carpenter sabotages the drama. The Thing is so single-mindedly determined to keep you awake that it almost puts you to sleep." [...] David Denby of New York magazine wrote that the original story may have influenced Invasion of the Body Snatchers and Alien, but a new adaptation seems derivative. [...] In his book Science Fiction (1984), Phil Hardy described the film as a [...] "surprising failure" [...] and [...] "Carpenter's most unsatisfying film to date." [...] The review noted that the narrative [...] "seems little more than an excuse for the various set-pieces of special effects and Russell's hero {{is no more than a}} cypher compared to Kenneth Tobey's <b>rounded</b> <b>character</b> in Howard Hawks' The Thing".|$|E
6000|$|All {{of which}} {{foregoing}} makes, I grant, a long parenthesis in my {{recovery of the}} more immediate Cambridge impressions. I have left them awaiting me, yet I am happy to say not sensibly the worse for it, in their cluster roundabout Miss Upham and her board of beneficiary images; which latter start up afresh and with the softest submission to any convenient neglect--that ineffably touching and confessed dependence of such apparitions on one's [...] "pleasure," [...] save the mark! for the flicker of restorative light. The image most vividly restored is doubtless that of Professor F. J. Child, head of the [...] "English Department" [...] at Harvard and master of that great modern science of folk-lore to his accomplishment in which his vast and slowly-published collection of the Ballad literature of our language is a recognised monument; delightful man, <b>rounded</b> <b>character,</b> passionate patriot, admirable talker, above all thorough humanist and humorist. He was the genial autocrat of that breakfast-table not only, but of our symposia otherwise timed, and as he comes back to me with the fresh and quite circular countenance of the time before the personal cares and complications of life had gravely thickened for him, his aspect all finely circular, with its close rings of the fairest hair, its golden rims of the largest glasses, its finished rotundity of figure and attitude, I see that there was the American spirit--since I was [...] "after" [...] it--of a quality deeply inbred, beautifully adjusted to all extensions of knowledge and taste and, as seemed to me, quite sublimely quickened by everything {{that was at the}} time so tremendously in question. That vision of him was never afterwards to yield to other lights--though these, even had occasion for them been more frequent with me, couldn't much have interfered with it; so that what I still most retain of him is the very flush and mobility, the living expansion and contraction, the bright comedy and almost lunar eclipse, of his cherubic face according as things appeared to be going for the country. I was always just across from him, as my brother, beside whom I took my place, had been, and I remember well how vivid a clock-face it became to me; I found still, as in my younger time, matter enough everywhere for gaping, but greatest of all, I think, while that tense season lasted, was my wonder for the signs and portents, the quips and cranks, the wreathèd smiles, or otherwise the candid obscurations, of our prime talker's presented visage. I set, as it were, the small tick of my own poor watch by it--which private register would thump or intermit in agreement with these indications. I recover it that, thanks to the perpetual play of his sympathy and irony, confidence and scorn, as well as to that of my own less certainly directed sensibility, he struck me on the bad days, which were then so many, as fairly august, cherubism and all, for sincerity of association with every light and shade, every ebb and flow, of our Cause. Where he most shone out, indeed, so that depression then wasn't a gloom in him but a darting flame, was in the icy air of the attitude of the nations to us, that of the couple, the most potent, across the sea, with which we were especially concerned and which, as during the whole earlier half of the War and still longer it more and more defined itself, drew from him at once all the drolleries and all the asperities of his sarcasm. Nothing more particularly touched me in him, I make out--for it lingers in a light of its own--than the fashion after which he struck me as a fond grave guardian, not so much of the memory and the ashes yet awhile, as of the promise, in all its flower, of the sacrificial young men whom the University connection had passed through his hands and whom he looked out for with a tenderness of interest, a nursing pride, that was as contagious as I could possibly have wished it. I didn't myself know the young men, save three or four, and could only, at our distance, hold my tongue and do them homage; never afterwards (as I even then foreknew would be the case) missing, when I could help it, or failing to pick up, a single brush, a scattered leaf, of their growing or their riper legend. Certain of them whom I had neither seen nor, as they fell in battle, was destined ever to see, have lived for me since just as communicated images, figures created by his tone about them--which, I admit, mightn't or needn't have mattered to me for all the years, yet which couldn't help so doing from the moment the right touch had handed them over to my restless claim.|$|E

5000|$|Many of Dickens's {{characters}} are [...] "flat", not [...] "round", in the novelist E. M. Forster's famous terms, meaning roughly {{that they have}} only one mood. For example, the Marquis is unremittingly wicked and relishes being so; Lucie is perfectly loving and supportive. As a corollary, Dickens often gives these characters verbal tics or visual quirks such as the dints in {{the nose of the}} Marquis.

40|$|In Aspects of the Novel, Edward Morgan Forster {{introduces}} the critical concepts of flat and round {{to describe the}} nature {{of different types of}} fictional characters. According to Forster’s theoretical categorization, flat characters are constructed and exist in their fictional realm around a single feature or quality. As this is the key criterion, Forster argues that flat characters can easily be recognized and remembered by the reader. Flat characters remain mostly the same through circumstances. In other words, flat characters never surprise the reader. Contrary to the nature of flat <b>characters,</b> <b>round</b> <b>characters</b> operate in an opposite direction to their counterparts. <b>Round</b> <b>characters</b> never remain the same throughout events, and {{it is not easy to}} recognize them since they do not exist under the dominance of a single trait. In addition to these, <b>round</b> <b>characters</b> are those who surprise the reader. Although Forster’s categorisation of fictional characters has functioned well in most of the cases, some characters are not easily analysed under this formula. Franz Kafka’s Gregor Samsa, for example, seems neither a round nor a flat character. Throughout his story, he remains the same. At the same time, he surprises the reader, which is not expected from him since he is mostly the same character in the text. Samsa’s turning into an insect further complicates the definition of his roundness or flatness. Another example is Iris Murdoch’s Mister Mars. Mister Mars is an animal. But at the same time he is a movie star, a celebrity. He has a pivotal role for the protagonist of the text. Therefore, the aim of this study is first to introduce the theoretical background of the nature of fictional characters and then to display some difficulties present particularly in Forster’s classification through the characterisation of two non-human examples...|$|R
