Walter Warriner, the Arborist of the city of Santa Monica proposed installing Rubbersidewalks by Rubbersidewalks, Inc., which could be easily lifted in order to prune the tree roots for maintenance. [...] After months of negations, the LAUSD decided not to remove the trees and agreed to install Rubbersidewalks, making University High School the first high school in the United States to use Rubbersidewalks in order to preserve its trees. Installation for the Rubbersidewalks started on November 20, 2003, over a year after the LAUSD had originally condemned the trees.Installation of the Rubbersidewalks was covered by Huell Howser for California's Gold.

This means that tires which are no longer suitable for use on vehicles due to wear or damage, can be recycled to serve a new economic purpose (<b>rubber</b> <b>asphalt</b> and concrete, fuel alternatives, carbon sources, etc.). The United States disposes of 279 million waste tires each year, representing over 4 million tons of scrap waste.The Economic problem with tires is that the polymeric materials that they are made of, do not decompose easily. Even after heavy use and wear, only a few grams are abraded from each tire before they are deemed not serviceable. This means that nearly the entire amount of rubber is discarded, and a valuable resource is left to become an environmental pollutant, if left to be disposed of. It {{is for this reason}} that waste tires must be viewed not only as an environmental issue, but also as an economic benefit.|$|E

A low-frequency adhesion fatigue test was proposed in this paper to study the effect of environment on the asphalt-aggregate adhesion system.

The factors influencing the adhesion fatigue performance were also investigated. Experiment results show that asphalt has more important effect on the adhesion performance comparing with aggregate.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} techniques for increasing the performance of pavement rehabilitation is the use of <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> mixtures, which utilize crumb rubber from used tires for modifying the asphalt to produce <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> binder. Crumb rubber can be produced by two different types of grinding, ambient and cryogenic. The <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> binder used in <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> mixtures can be obtained through two different processes, terminal blending (produced at a refinery) and continuous blending (produced in a plant). Because the performance of the <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> binder depends on the elastomeric properties of the crumb rubber, the manufacturing process, especially the digestion time, influences these properties. The digestion time is responsible for the interaction between the crumb rubber and the straight asphalt, which is characterized by the amount of elastomeric properties transferred to the straight asphalt. This paper presents an assessment of the digestion time using conventional performance-related tests and scanning electron microscopy analyses, which examined the surface of <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> binder. In this study, two straight asphalts with different penetrations and two crumb rubbers, an ambient crumb rubber and a cryogenic crumb rubber, were considered.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Rubber-modified asphalt {{pavements}} {{have been}} used in Sweden and the United States since the 1970 's. In these applications ground recycled tire particles (1 / 4 inch minus) are added to a gap-graded aggregate and then mixed with hot asphalt cement. The benefits of adding rubber to the mix include increased skid resistance under icy conditions, improved flexibility and crack resistance, elimination of solid waste, and reduced traffic noise. The major disadvantage of these rubber-modified mixes is their high cost in relation to conventional asphaltic concrete pavements. This research project consisted of a laboratory study of mix properties as a function of variables such as rubber gradation and content, void content, aggregate gradation, mix process, temperature, and asphalt content. Twenty different mix combinations were evaluated for diametral modulus and fatigue at two different temperatures (- 6 °C, + 10 °C). Also, five different mix combinations were evaluated for static creep and permanent deformation. Layered theory was used to evaluate the effects of mixture variations on pavement life. The resulting information was used to develop guidelines for use of <b>rubber</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixes in United States road systems. The findings of the field survey indicate that the rubber-modified asphalt mixture is more susceptible than the conventional mixtures to preparation and compaction problems when adverse weather or equipment problems occur. However, with adequate equipment and favorable weather conditions, the rubber-modified asphalt mixture placement is similar to conventional mixture placement. The field study also indicates that stopping distances can be reduced 20 percent for the rubber-modified pavements in icy conditions. In view of the significant reductions in wintertime stopping distances under icy or frosty road surface conditions, the use of coarse rubber in asphalt pavements should be seriously considered. This is particularly true for areas such as bridge decks, on and off freeway ramps or insulated roadway sections. The findings of the laboratory study indicate that the rubber gradation and content, aggregate gradation, and use of surcharge during sample preparation have considerable effect on modulus and fatigue life of the mix. The results of static creep and permanent deformation tests indicate that the <b>rubber</b> <b>asphalt</b> mixes had low stability and high elasticity. Also, due to greater allowable tensile strain in rubber-modified mixtures, the thickness of the modified mixture can be reduced, using a layer equivalency of 1. 4 to 1. 0...|$|E

The “Binder Accelerated Separator” method was used to divide the constituents of the <b>Asphalt</b> <b>Rubber</b> and bio-binder (residual binder and swelled rubber). The physical and chemical changes in the <b>Asphalt</b> <b>Rubber</b> and bio-binder and in the residual binders (residual bitumen and residual bio-oil) were evaluated. The results demonstrate that the produced bio-binder is suitable for use in flexible pavements with properties comparable to those of conventional and <b>Asphalt</b> <b>Rubber</b> binders...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> is a {{material}} {{produced by the}} incorporation of crumb rubber obtained from ground tires in straight asphalt and its properties {{are influenced by the}} components properties. The crumb rubber gradation is one of the variables which have a significant influence on <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> properties. Thus, this work studies the influence of crumb rubber gradation on the <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> properties expressed by penetration, rotational viscosity (using the Brookfield viscometer), resilience and softening point. Test samples were produced with a 50 / 70 penetration grade straight asphalt and a crumb rubber obtained by the grinding process which basically consists in a tearing and crushing the old tires at ambient temperature. The digestion time was 60 minutes and the digestion temperature was 170 ºC. The results show that the rotational viscosity and the resilience are the properties most affected by the crumb rubber. It was also observed that the increase of the crumb rubber specific surface (fine crumb <b>rubber)</b> produces <b>asphalt</b> <b>rubber</b> with higher viscosity and lower resilience. The use of coarse crumb rubber influences mainly the resilience...|$|R
