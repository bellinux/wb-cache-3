25|$|Long-term {{transfusion}} {{therapy to}} maintain the patient’s hemoglobin level above 9-10 g/dL (normal levels are 13.8 for males, and 12.1 for females). Patients are transfused by meeting strict criteria ensuring their safety. They must have: confirmed laboratory diagnosis of thalassemia major, and hemoglobin levels less than 7g/dL, {{to be eligible for}} the transfusion. To ensure quality blood transfusions, the packed red blood cells should be leucoreduced with a minimum of 40g of hemoglobin content. By having leucoreduced blood packets, the patient is at a lower risk to develop adverse reactions by contaminated white cells and preventing platelet alloimmunisation. Pre-storage filtration of whole blood offers high efficiency for removal and low residual of leukocytes; It is the preferred method of leucoreduction compared to pre-transfusion and bedside filtration. Patients with allergic transfusion reactions or unusual <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies must received “washed red cells” or “cryopreserved red cells.” Washed red cells have been removed of plasma proteins that would have become a target of the patient’s antibodies allowing the transfusion to be carried out safely. Cryopreserved red cells are used to maintain a supply of rare donor units for patients with unusual <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> antibodies or missing common <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> antigens. The transfusion programs available involve lifelong regular blood transfusion to main the pre-transfusion hemoglobin level above 9-10 g/gL.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Exposure of {{phosphatidylserine}} on {{the outside}} of <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> contributes to recognition and removal of old and damaged cells. The fraction of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> varies between donors, and increases in <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates during storage. The susceptibility of <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> to stress-induced phosphatidylserine exposure increases with storage. Phosphatidylserine exposure may, therefore, constitute a link between donor variation and the quality of <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order {{to examine the relationship between}} storage parameters and donor characteristics, the percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> was measured in <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates during storage and in fresh <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> from blood bank donors. The percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> was compared with <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> susceptibility to osmotic stress-induced phosphatidylserine exposure in vitro, with the regular <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrate quality parameters, and with the donor characteristics age, body mass index, haemoglobin level, gender and blood group. RESULTS: Phosphatidylserine exposure varies between donors, both on <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> freshly isolated from the blood, and on <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> in <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates. Phosphatidylserine exposure increases with storage time, and is correlated with stress-induced phosphatidylserine exposure. Increased phosphatidylserine exposure during storage was found to be associated with haemolysis and vesicle concentration in <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates. The percentage of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> showed a positive correlation with the plasma haemoglobin concentration of the donor. DISCUSSION: The fraction of phosphatidylserine-exposing <b>red</b> blood <b>cells</b> is a parameter of <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> integrity in <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates and may be an indicator of <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> survival after transfusion. Measurement of phosphatidylserine exposure may be useful in the selection of donors and <b>red</b> blood <b>cell</b> concentrates for specific groups of patients...|$|R
25|$|Erythropoietin {{has been}} shown to exert its effects by binding to the {{erythropoietin}} receptor (EpoR). EPO binds to the erythropoietin receptor on the <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> progenitor surface and activates a JAK2 signaling cascade. This initiates the STAT5, PIK3 and Ras MAPK pathways. This results in differentiation, survival and proliferation of the erythroid cell. SOCS1, SOCS3 and CIS are also expressed which act as negative regulators of the cytokine signal. High level erythropoietin receptor expression is localized to erythroid progenitor cells. While there are reports that EPO receptors are found {{in a number of other}} tissues, such as heart, muscle, kidney and peripheral/central nervous tissue, those results are confounded by nonspecificity of reagents such as anti-EpoR antibodies. In controlled experiments, EPO receptor is not detected in those tissues. In the bloodstream, red cells themselves do not express erythropoietin receptor, so cannot respond to EPO. However, indirect dependence of <b>red</b> <b>cell</b> longevity in the blood on plasma erythropoietin levels has been reported, a process termed neocytolysis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSouth-east Asian ovalocytosis (SAO) {{results from}} the {{heterozygous}} presence of an abnormal band 3, which causes several alterations in {{the properties of the}} erythrocytes. Although earlier studies suggested that SAO erythrocytes are refractory to invasion in vitro by the malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum, a more recent study showed that fresh SAO cells were invaded by the parasites, but became resistant to invasion on storage because intracellular ATP was depleted more rapidly than normal. Here we show that SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> are much more leaky to sodium and potassium than normal <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> when stored in the cold. This leak was much less marked when the cells were stored at 25 or 37 °C. Incubation for 3. 5 h at 37 °C of cold-stored SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> did not restore sodium and potassium to normal levels, probably because the depleted ATP level in cold-stored SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> is further reduced with incubation at 37 °C. The increased leakiness of SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> is non-specific and extends to calcium ions, taurine, mannitol and sucrose. These results suggest that SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> undergo a structural change on cooling. Since many of the reports describing altered properties of SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> have used cells which have been stored in the cold, these results need re-evaluation using never-chilled SAO <b>red</b> <b>cells</b> to assess whether the cells have the same abnormal properties under in vivo conditions...|$|R
