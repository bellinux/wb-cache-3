According to Manuel Vázquez Montalbán, {{the best way}} for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Barça. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence. During Franco's regime, however, the blaugrana team was granted profit due to its good relationship with the dictator at management level, even giving two awards to him.|$|E
25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Indus Civilisation's localisation, <b>regional</b> <b>cultures</b> emerged, to varying degrees showing the influence of the Indus Civilisation. In the formerly great city of Harappa, burials have been found that correspond to a regional culture called the Cemetery H culture. At the same time, the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture expanded from Rajasthan into the Gangetic Plain. The Cemetery H culture has the earliest evidence for cremation; a practice dominant in Hinduism today.|$|E

Chapter 5 summarizes results of questionnaire survey, which is focused on finding how students of elementary and grammar schools are informed about culture in their regions and {{as well as their}} approach to the local culture and role of schools in cultural education. The final part of this diploma thesis is devoted to my project proposal that should lead students to closer relationship with cultural and historical heritage in their regions, showed on the example of Uherskobrodsko region.

By this time, villagers had domesticated numerous crops, including peas, sesame seeds, dates, and cotton, as well as animals, including the water buffalo. Early Harappan communities turned to large urban centres by 2600 BCE, from where the mature Harappan phase started. The latest research shows that Indus Valley people migrated from villages to cities.|$|E
25|$|French Canadian {{identities are}} {{influenced}} by historical events that inform <b>regional</b> <b>cultures.</b> For example, in New England, the relatively recent immigration (19th/20th centuries) is informed by experiences of language oppression and an identification with certain occupations, such as the mill workers. In the Great Lakes, many French Canadians also identify as Métis and trace their ancestry to the earliest voyageurs and settlers; many also have ancestry dating to the lumber era and often a mixture of the two groups.|$|E
25|$|According to Fischer, the {{foundation}} of America's four <b>regional</b> <b>cultures</b> was formed from four mass migrations from four regions of the British Isles by four distinct ethno-cultural groups. New England's formative period occurred between 1629 and 1640 when Puritans, mostly from East Anglia, settled there, thus forming {{the basis for the}} New England regional culture. The next mass migration was of southern English Cavaliers and their working class English servants to the Chesapeake Bay region between 1640 and 1675. This spawned the creation of the American Southern culture.|$|E

25|$|As complex civilizations {{arose in}} the Eastern Hemisphere, the {{indigenous}} societies in the Americas remained relatively simple and fragmented into diverse <b>regional</b> <b>cultures.</b> During the formative stage in Mesoamerica (about 1500 BCE to 500 CE), more complex and centralized civilizations began to develop, mostly {{in what is now}} Mexico, Central America, and Peru. They included civilizations such as the Olmec, Maya, Zapotec, Moche, and Nazca. They developed agriculture, growing maize, chili peppers, cocoa, tomatoes, and potatoes, crops unique to the Americas, and creating distinct cultures and religions. These ancient indigenous societies would be greatly affected, for good and ill, by European contact during the early modern period.|$|E
25|$|The Late Archaic period {{started about}} 3000 BC, when Florida's climate had reached current {{conditions}} and the sea had risen close to its present level. People commonly occupied both fresh and saltwater wetlands. Large shell middens accumulated during this period. Many people lived in large villages with purpose-built earthwork mounds, such as at Horr's Island, which had the largest permanently occupied community in the Archaic period in the southeastern United States. It also has the oldest burial mound in the East, dating to about 1450 BC. People began making fired pottery in Florida by 2000 BC. By about 500 BC, the Archaic culture, which had been fairly uniform across Florida, began to fragment into <b>regional</b> <b>cultures.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Parthians largely {{adopted the}} art, architecture, {{religious}} beliefs, and royal insignia of their culturally heterogeneous empire, which encompassed Persian, Hellenistic, and <b>regional</b> <b>cultures.</b> For {{about the first}} half of its existence, the Arsacid court adopted elements of Greek culture, though it eventually saw a gradual revival of Iranian traditions. The Arsacid rulers were titled the [...] "King of Kings", as a claim to be the heirs to the Achaemenid Empire; indeed, they accepted many local kings as vassals where the Achaemenids would have had centrally appointed, albeit largely autonomous, satraps. The court did appoint a small number of satraps, largely outside Iran, but these satrapies were smaller and less powerful than the Achaemenid potentates. With the expansion of Arsacid power, the seat of central government shifted from Nisa to Ctesiphon along the Tigris (south of modern Baghdad, Iraq), although several other sites also served as capitals.|$|E

2500|$|In his 1989 book, Albion's Seed (...) , David Hackett Fischer {{suggests}} that the United States is made up today of four distinct <b>regional</b> <b>cultures.</b> The book's {{focus is on the}} folkways of four groups of settlers from the British Isles that emigrated from distinct regions of Britain and Ireland to the British American colonies during the 17th and 18th centuries.

2500|$|The {{architectural}} critic Kenneth Frampton considers Bagsværd Church {{an outstanding}} example of critical regionalism {{owing to the}} synthesis it achieves between universal and <b>regional</b> <b>cultures.</b> He believes {{the design of the}} highly configurated concrete shell vault, unique in Western religious architecture, was inspired by the Chinese pagoda roof cited by Utzon in his essay [...] "Platforms and Plateaus" [...] (1963). Furthermore, the plan arrangement of the church's interior is reminiscent of Chinese Buddhist monasteries as described in a book by Johannes Prip-Møller.|$|E
2500|$|This {{settlement}} {{resulted in}} the formation of what is today considered the [...] "General American" [...] culture, although, according to Fischer, it is really just a regional American culture, even if it does today encompass most of the U.S. from the mid-Atlantic states to the Pacific Coast. [...] Finally, Irish, Scottish and English settlers from the borderlands of Britain and Ireland migrated to Appalachia between 1717-1775. [...] They formed the regional culture of the Upland South, which has since spread west to such areas as West Texas and parts of the U.S. Southwest. Fischer says that the modern U.S. is composed only of <b>regional</b> <b>cultures,</b> with characteristics determined by the place of departure and time of arrival of these four distinct founding populations.|$|E
2500|$|In his book, Fischer {{brings up}} several points. He {{states that the}} U.S. is not a country with one [...] "general" [...] culture and several [...] "regional" [...] culture, as is {{commonly}} thought. Rather, there are only four <b>regional</b> <b>cultures</b> as described above, and understanding this helps one to more clearly understand American history as well as contemporary American life. Fischer asserts {{that it is not}} only important to understand where different groups came from, but when. All population groups have, at different times, their own unique set of beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices. When different groups came to America and brought certain beliefs and values with them, these ideas became, according to Fischer, more or less frozen in time, even if they eventually changed in their original place of origin.|$|E
