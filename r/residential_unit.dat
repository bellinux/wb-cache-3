40|$|Airtightness plays a {{significant}} role in the energy efficiency of buildings. In this paper, we investigated how varying the type of window affects the airtightness values of <b>residential</b> <b>units.</b> We studied three sets of <b>residential</b> <b>units,</b> each comprising two <b>residential</b> <b>units</b> with the same geometry and year of construction, varying only the installed window type and window-frame material. A brief explanation is included of the blower-door method, used in field-testing the airtightness of <b>residential</b> <b>units.</b> Replacing the old windows in the <b>residential</b> <b>units</b> with newer windows significantly improved the airtightness. To generalize these results, further research is needed with larger samples...|$|R

25|$|At {{the time}} of the 1937 Ponce Massacre, the owners were Francisco de Jesus y Graciela Toro Vendrell. In 1945 the {{property}} was sold to Juan Riera Ginard and Carmen M. Toro de Riera, who never occupied the house but instead used it as a source of rental income. The house was rented out in two units: the first floor as commercial space and the second floor as <b>residential</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The rectangular-shaped site, as {{encompassed}} by {{the heritage}} boundary and corresponding almost exactly with the 1896 {{extent of the}} lighthouse reserve, covers an area of 868 square metres and is orientated north–south. It {{is divided into two}} lots – the present day (2009) Lighthouse Reserve at the southern end (1/RP135230) and Lions Park at the northern end (2/RP135230). The western boundary is defined by Canberra Terrace, which leads down into the main commercial spine of Caloundra, Bulcock Street. The northern boundary is made by Arthur Street, a long straight road descending steeply from the intersection with Canberra Terrace at the north-western corner of the park. Single residences occupy the allotments to the east of the site, while a number of medium-rise <b>residential</b> <b>unit</b> blocks have been built from the adjacent property to the south down Canberra Terrace.|$|E
40|$|The {{governing}} {{bodies of the}} association of owners of (<b>residential)</b> <b>units</b> and their decision/making This thesis deals with the {{governing bodies}} of the asscociation of owners of (<b>residential)</b> <b>units,</b> their position in Czech legal order and their decision-making. Thesis is focused on the performance of decision making in practise and problems which are associated with it. It focuses primarily on the enactment of Act No. 72 / 1994 Coll., Act on ownership of (<b>residential)</b> <b>units,</b> including government regulation No. 371 / 2004 Coll., where are defined standard Articles of owners of (<b>residential)</b> <b>units,</b> which focuses on the problematic provisions or lack of legislation. The thesis consists of four chapters. The first chapter is introductory, there are defined goals of the work, postition of ownership of units in the Czech legal system, its historical development and definition of key terms. The second chapter describes the association of owners of (<b>residential)</b> <b>units</b> as a legal person, its origin, the rights and obligations standing in the legal system, including membership, which takes a closer view of the conditions, rights and obligations of individual members, and way of termination of membership.

25|$|The {{new light}} at Caloundra Head had a {{relatively}} short working life, with nearby high-rise <b>residential</b> <b>unit</b> development obscuring views of the light from sea and rendering it ineffective. Downgraded, the 1968 light was transferred on a reduced area of land (868m2) to the Queensland Treasury in 1974 and it continued to operate as a harbour light and signal station. A new tower, Point Cartwright Light, constructed {{at the mouth of}} the Mooloola River at Point Cartwright in 1978 took over the role of lighting the North West Channel. In 1992 the function of the Caloundra Signal Station was replaced by an automatic radar/microwave link unit on the roof of units at Wickham Point to the east, resulting in the station being de-manned. In the late 1990s the light was replaced by a beacon on Wickham Point. Some radio equipment was left in operation at the Caloundra Signal Station, which is still used by local emergency services.|$|E
