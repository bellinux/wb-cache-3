(It was possible, with a special utility, to reclaim most of this space for data if a disk {{did not need to}} be bootable.) A short ROM program on the disk controller had the ability to seek to track zero - which it did without regard for the read/write head's current position, resulting in the characteristic [...] "chattering" [...] sound of a Disk II boot, which was the read/write head hitting the <b>rubber</b> <b>stop</b> block at the end of the rail - and read and execute code from sector 0. The code contained in there would then pull in the rest of the operating system. DOS stored the disk's directory on track 17, smack in the middle of the 35-track disks, in order to reduce the average seek time to the frequently used directory track. The directory was fixed in size and could hold a maximum of 105 files. Subdirectories were not supported.|$|E
40|$|A {{resilient}} soft liner (RSL) {{has been}} used in processed complete dentures but controlling its thickness has always been a challenge because of uneven reduction of the denture’s intaglio surface. Use of a thermoplastic vacuum-formed template and an endodontic K-file, as guides, for the reduction of a processed mandibular complete denture to receive RSL is described in the present report. A processed mandibular complete denture is prepared by reducing its borders and drilling holes in its surface. A thermoplastic sheet adapted to the intaglio surface and an endodontic K-file with <b>rubber</b> <b>stop</b> adjusted to the desired dimension are used as guides to the reduction procedure and allows intermittent measuring of the reduced areas. This technique helps in reducing the processed denture’s intaglio surface in a controlled manner thus maintaining the strength of the denture base and effectiveness of soft liner.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{applicability}} of gray scale inversion in performing digital linear endodontic measurements. Standardized digital images were taken of 40 extracted human permanent single-rooted teeth with K-files size 15 placed at different lengths in the root canal, using the CDR Wireless® digital system. All images were treated with Positive, a digital tool that inverts the grayscale value. Eight radiologists measured the distance between the lower limit of the <b>rubber</b> <b>stop</b> and the tip of the file on both original and positive images. After 15 days, they repeated this procedure in 50 % of the image samples. The intra- and inter-examiner agreement was analyzed by intraclass correlation test, and the comparison between the two image groups and the actual lengths by the Student's t-test (&# 945;= 0. 05). Intra- and inter-examiner evaluation showed high reproducibility (r> 0. 95) of both original and positive images. No statistically significant differences (p> 0. 05) were found between measurements performed on original and positive images, but both differed significantly from the actual lengths (p< 0. 05). Gray scale inversion has low applicability in measuring endodontic files, since it did not improve the accuracy of measurements...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Endodontic {{treatment}} comprises individual {{steps that}} should be effectively performed {{in order to achieve}} therapeutic success. Among these steps is the determination of the real tooth length, which prevents damage to the periapical tissues during instrumentation and obturation, due to restrict the operator action, favoring tissue repair. Objective: The present study aimed to evaluate in vitro the reliability of two electronic apical locators (Root ZX II® and Propex II®) in working length determination, compared to direct visual measurement. Material and methods: Forty single-rooted human teeth were selected; the pulp chamber was accessed and a size 10 Kerr file was inserted into the canal until its tip was visible at the apical foramen with x 8 magnification. At this point, a <b>rubber</b> <b>stop</b> was placed on the file, at the incisal edge, and this length was measured with an endodontic ruler, therefore, recording the real tooth length (RTL). Then, the teeth were embedded in a vegetable sponge (loofah) base, soaked in saline solution. Electronic measurements were carried out using Root ZX II® and Propex II® locators, until an “Apex” reading was observed. The measurements obtained by the different methods were compared. Results: Root ZX II® apical locator showed 93 % of correct readings, while Propex II® locator was correct in 90 % of the measurements. No statistically significant difference was observed between the two apex locators tested (p = 0. 05). Conclusion: Both apex locators showed an acceptable percentage of correct readings and, therefore, may be recommended for clinical use...|$|E

5000|$|Football {{remained}} a popular sport in England throughout the ensuing centuries, but it wasn’t until {{the emergence of}} The Football Association in 1863 that the sport of football emerged as an actual organized game in England. [...] With this, the sport took off in popularity, and understandably a demand for equipment began to emerge to ensure player safety and comfort. More importantly, technological innovations during this time period {{played a key role}} in new methods and materials used for production of cleats. In the 1840s, a method of hardening <b>rubber</b> and <b>stopping</b> it from decaying, called vulcanization, was developed in both England and the United States. [...] Vulcanized rubber is used in the production of all types of shoes, but is especially beneficial in the production of cleats, in that one of the primary purposes of football cleats is to protect the player's feet. Technology continued to improve in the coming decades, and by the 1890s studs are first used to make football cleats. The concept of spiked and studded shoes for other sports began to emerge as well in the late 19th century. In the 1890s, a British Company (now known as Reebok), developed the earliest known spiked leather running shoes.|$|R

40|$|The {{behavioural}} {{measures of}} 31 red and 39 fallow deer yearlings prior to, during and following application of rubber ring to prevent antler growth were determined. Animals were mechanically or manually restrained and treated {{according to their}} random allocation {{to one of the}} following groups: control (C), local anaesthesia only(LC), local anaesthesia and rubber ring application (LR), rubber ring application only(R). In a further field trial 45 yearling red deer stags and 84 yearling fallow bucks were randomly allocated to control or rubber ring application. In both studies the development of the pedicle/antler post treatment was examined at intervals to investigate the percentage of loss of pedicle/antler due to the treatment and to detect possible side effects of the treatment. In red deer during the first three hours post treatment a significant increase in walking, standing and feeding and a decrease in lying were seen in the R group. Twenty minutes after treatment the R group showed a significantly higher frequency of scratching. In fallow deer a significant increase in frequency of ear flicks was observed in the R group until six hours post treatment. Other activities (walking,standing, lying) varied significantly at some time periods but no consistent patterns were observed. In both species a substantial reduction of the pedicle/antler could be observed two to four weeks after application of rubber rings. However, the loss of distal parts of the pedicle/antler varied in percentage and time until the loss. A rate of 38 - 100 % regrowth occurred in the first study in fallow and red deer, respectively. In red deer the application of <b>rubber</b> rings <b>stopped</b> further antler growth in 36 of 37 stags thirty days after treatment. The loss of pedicle/antler occurred in 60 - 66. 7 %.

50|$|Larnaca Salt Lake (Αλυκή Λάρνακας, Larnaka Tuz Gölü) is {{a complex}} network of four salt lakes (3 of them interconnected) of {{different}} sizes {{to the west of}} the city of Larnaca. The largest is lake Aliki, followed by lake Orphani, lake Soros and lake Spiro. They form the second largest salt lake in Cyprus after the Limassol Salt Lake. The total surface area of the lakes adds up to 2.2 km2 and being just off the road leading to Larnaca International Airport is one of the most distinctive landmarks of the area. It is considered one of the most important wetlands of Cyprus and it has been declared a Ramsar site, Natura 2000 site, Special Protected Area under the Barcelona Convention and an Important Bird Area (IBA). It is surrounded by halophytic scrubland and on its bank lies the Hala Sultan Tekke, one of the holiest of shrines within Ottoman Islam. It houses the tomb of Umm Haram, Muhammad's 'wet-nurse'.Besides its picturesque beauty, the lake is the haunt of 85 species of water-birds with estimated populations between 20,000-38,000. It is one of the important migratory passages through Cyprus. Among them are 2,000-12,000 flamingoes (Phoenicopterus ruber) which spend the winter months there feeding off populations of the brine shrimp Artemia salina. Other important bird species are Grus grus, Charadrius alexandrines, Larus ridibundus, Himantopus himantopus, Burhinus oedicnemus, Hoplopterus spinosus, Oenanthe cypriaca and Sylvia melanothorax. Flocks of birdwatchers gather to observe the blaze of pink from flamingoes as they gather in the centre of the lake but also the other important migrants. The Larnaca Salt Lake complex was declared as a protected area by a decision of the Council of Ministers in 1997.Recent evidence suggests that contrary to previous belief the greater flamingo, (Phoenicopterus <b>rubber)</b> not only <b>stops</b> over but also breeds on this wetland.|$|R
40|$|The {{persistent}} {{increase of}} container vessel dimensions requires ports to adapt their wet infrastructure {{in order to}} compete with their competitors. However, in some cases waterway tunnels are expected to restrict the maximum depth. The Beneluxtunnel in Rotterdam {{is an example of}} such a tunnel. To allow more depth, the possibility of lowering this tunnel is studied. The Beneluxtunnel consists of two immersed tunnels constructed in 1967 and 2002. They consist of prefabricated elements that are immersed and connected to land parts {{on either side of the}} waterway. To allow lowering, various design options have been proposed in this study: 9 ̆ 5 Regarding the land part, the options are proposed (1) to do nothing, (2) to make local adjustments utilizing the space provided by the dewatering cellar or (3) to apply general lowering which would affect the entire structure. 9 ̆ 5 Regarding the immersed part, the options are proposed (1) to adapt the river bottom, (2) to lower the elements while they remain immersed by utilizing the limited freedom of rotation in its joints or (3) to re-float the elements to be re-immersed on a lowered bed. 9 ̆ 5 Regarding traffic requirements, an option is to lower the maximum speed which would allow for steeper slopes. These options and their combinations have been analysed to determine their feasibility and value. To do so, first all aspects regarding the functional design are determined. The relations between traffic requirements and navigation channel dimensions have been determined, resulting in an overview of possible vertical profiles for all relevant design combinations. Apart from a first estimate of the effectivity of the design options, it also showed that the 1 st Beneluxtunnel is governing because of the shorter length of its immersed part. For the technical design, the design of the original tunnel is analysed and for some important aspects, the structural capacity has been determined. This information is used to determine the effects of lowering on the tunnel and to estimate the associated lowering capacity in terms of vertical displacement profiles. This analysis shows that for all realistic design options, the structural capacity is sufficient. Apart from the lowering, also the effects and limitations of joint rotations have been determined. Both for the segment joints and the immersion joints, the <b>rubber</b> water <b>stops</b> are critical in determining the maximum rotation. The applied rotations must however be less as additional settlement could increase them. The vertical profiles associated with these rotations show significant depth increase, ranging up to 4. 5 m. ? To determine the technical feasibility, the design must also be constructible. Hence, for four of the design options, the construction methods have been determined and proposed: 9 ̆ 5 To lower the immersed part while it remains immersed, the soil must be removed below the elements by special dredging equipment. Also the supporting tiles must be removed. The large longitudinal pressure is expected to allow this without supports. However, for the lowering process, applying pre-tensioning and temporary supports is required. Special components connected to the pre-tensioning should allow to control the lowering process. Finally, the soil can be returned and the tunnel can be finished. 9 ̆ 5 To re-float the elements, the closure joint must be re-opened. Next, the weight of the elements must be reduced by removing the ballast. Instead of re-floating it is chosen to lift the elements which allows better control of the process. The elements can now be transported to a location where they can be stored and adapted. When the bed is lowered and the land parts are finished, the elements can be re-immersed. 9 ̆ 5 To locally adjust the land part, access is required which requires for the connecting element to be removed and for a watertight screen to be placed. Next, the old transition point can be demolished and the new transition point can be constructed within the existing abutment, utilizing the space provided by the dewatering cellar. 9 ̆ 5 General lowering can be achieved by wet reconstruction. First, additional anchors have to be inserted in the walls. Next the land part can be flooded and the entire abutment and underwater concrete floor must be demolished. A new floor should be constructed at a few meters below, but first additional anchors must be inserted into the soil to provide vertical stability. Finally, water could be pumped out and everything could be reconstructed. Finally, the construction sequences are used to estimate the costs of the design options and their combinations. The results were combined with the maximum navigation depth increase to determine the most cost effective solution for different lowering ranges. Also the long and short term traffic costs (traffic jams) have been taken into account. The results are: Depth increase Land part Immersed part Costs (millions) 0. 0 - 0. 9 m Local adjustments on both sides Remain immersed 8 ̆ 0 295 0. 9 - 1. 9 m General lowering on one side Remain immersed 8 ̆ 0 415 1. 9 - 3. 2 m General lowering on both sides Remain immersed 8 ̆ 0 500 3. 2 - 3. 6 m General lowering on both sides Re-float 8 ̆ 0 665 > 3. 6 m New immersed tunnel 8 ̆ 0 730 This study has proven that lowering the Beneluxtunnel is technically feasible and a cost effective method to increase the navigation draught. ?Hydraulic structuresHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
