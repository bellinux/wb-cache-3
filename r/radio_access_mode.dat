40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of the Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) mode of the Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) based Universal Mo-bile Telecommunication System (UMTS) is investigated. The new call blocking and call dropping probabilities, the probability of low-quality ac-cess {{as well as the}} required average transmit power are quantified both with and without the assistance of adaptive antenna arrays as well as with and without encountering shadow fading. In some of the scenarios investigated the system’s user capacity is doubled with the advent of adaptive antennas. I.

40|$|Mobile {{communication}} technology evolved rapidly {{over the last}} few years due to increasing demands such as accessing Internet services on mobile phones with a better quality of the offered services. In order to fulfil this, wireless telecommunication industry worked hard and defined a new air interface for mobile communications which enhances the overall system performance by increasing the capacity of the system along with improving spectral efficiencies while reducing latencies. For this, two technologies, called Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX) and Third Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3 GPP LTE), emerged with an aim of providing voice, data, video and multimedia services on mobile phones at high speeds and cheap rates. In this thesis, we have conducted a detailed comparative study between WiMAX and 3 GPP LTE by focusing on their first two layers, i. e. Physical and MAC layer. The comparison specifically includes system architecture, radio aspects of the air interface (such as frequency band, <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> <b>modes,</b> multiple <b>access</b> technologies, multiple antenna technologies and modulation), protocol aspects of the air interface (in terms of protocol architecture, modulation and frame structure), mobility and Quality of Service (QoS). We have also given a brief comparative summary of both technologies in our thesis. In the thesis, we investigated the LTE uplink and performed link level simulations of Single Carrier Frequency Domain Equalization (SC-FDE) and Single Carrier Frequency Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in comparison with Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The comparison has been in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Symbol Error Rate (SER). In order to verify the theoretical results, we simulated the Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of SC-FDMA system in comparison with OFDMA. We also simulated the capacity of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems in comparison with Single Input Single Output (SISO) systems. The simulation was performed on a PC running MATLAB 7. 40 (R 2007 a). The operating system used in the simulation was Microsoft Windows Vista...|$|R
40|$|Emerging <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> {{technologies}} such as wireless personal and metropolitan area networks and digital broadcasting are a new era for wireless communications. These standards aim at complementing existing cellular/Wi-Fi networks in order to offer {{a wide range of}} available <b>access</b> <b>modes</b> to mobile terminals. Multiradio wireless systems referred to as composite <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> networks, bear diverse capabilities, with the optimal radio being invoked to perform a specific set of functions. Composite reconfigurable radio networks support the collaboration {{of a wide range of}} heterogeneous <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> technologies under a single or multiple administrative boundaries, adding further intelligence to the way devices attach to and switch between networks spatially and temporally. The EU End-to-End Reconfigurability (ER) research project envisages composite reconfigurable radio networks coupled with legacy as well as evolved core network architectures, yielding simpler and flexible configurations for reduced latencies, autonomic operation, and adaptive functionality. This article presents a cohesive model for controlling and managing such networks, elaborates on the constituent functional entities, and maps this model to two-tier network support architecture. Finally, key security issues for software download over reconfigurable radios and systems are identified and solutions for software certification and authorization as well as for the authentication of roaming terminals are proposed...|$|R
40|$|The fog <b>radio</b> <b>access</b> network (F-RAN) is a {{promising}} paradigm {{for the fifth}} generation wireless communication systems to provide high spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Characterizing users to select an appropriate communication <b>mode</b> among fog <b>access</b> point (F-AP), and device-to-device (D 2 D) in F-RANs is critical for performance optimization. Using evolutionary game theory, we investigate the dynamics of user <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> selection in F-RANs. Specifically, the competition among groups of potential users space is formulated as a dynamic evolutionary game, and the evolutionary equilibrium is {{the solution to this}} game. Stochastic geometry tool is used to derive the proposals' payoff expressions for both F-AP and D 2 D users by taking into account the different nodes locations, cache sizes as well as the delay cost. The analytical results obtained from the game model are evaluated via simulations, which show that the evolutionary game based <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> selection algorithm can reach a much higher payoff than the max rate based algorithm.

40|$|Modelling airport {{choice of}} {{passengers}} {{has been a}} subject of interest for air transport scientists and airport managers already for a while. Wilken, Berster and Gelhausen have reported of a market segment specific model approach to airport choice in Germany in a paper entitled "Airport Choice in Germany - New Empirical Evidence of the German Air Traveller Survey 2003 " presented at the Air Transport Research Society World Conference 2005 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In continuation of the analysis of airport choice, {{based on the evidence}} coming from the data of the survey mentioned, this paper deals with a model of combined airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice in Germany by market segment. The question arises why to model airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice simultaneously. The underlying hypothesis is that airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice are closely interrelated. Air travellers typically have a strong preference to choose the nearest airport as the aforementioned survey reveals. In Germany, 67 % of the air travellers choose on average the nearest airport, however, travel time not only depends on distance covered, but also on the accessibility of fast <b>access</b> <b>modes,</b> such as for instance high speed intercity trains, to reduce travel time. Access time and access cost {{play a major role in}} airport choice, which in turn depend on <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice. The availability of <b>access</b> <b>modes</b> is again airport specific. Because of the strong dependence of airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice on each other a combined model approach seems more sensible than two separate models. The combined approach allows including the aforementioned interrelations. This paper presents a combined airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice model based on a nested logit approach, first presented at the Air Transport Research Society World Conference 2006 in Nagoya, Japan. It is called a "generalized nested logit model for airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice" as it is not restricted to specific airports or a certain number of airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> combinations, but allows to evaluate airport plans like the future Berlin-Brandenburg International Airport (BBI) in the southeast of Berlin or the introduction of new <b>access</b> <b>modes,</b> like a direct high speed intercity train access at already existing airports as this was the case between Cologne and Frankfurt airport in 2002. The case study concluding the paper is a modified excerpt of a study dealing with different future scenarios relating to airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> choice in the Cologne region conducted by the author. As a means to achieve a general applicability of the model airports have been grouped into “airport categories”. Airports are categorised from a demand-oriented point of view to form clusters of homogenous airports regarding their general picture of their flight plan. The model is of particular interest for airport managers as well as high speed rail providers since it shows the dependence between the market share of an airport and <b>access</b> <b>mode</b> combination and its quality regarding their attributes, e. g. travel time, travel cost and weekly flight frequency to a given destination. ...|$|R
