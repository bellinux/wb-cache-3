This suggests endothermic metabolism, because an ectothermic animal would be unable to walk or run, and thus to evade predators, when its core temperature was lowered. Other evidence for endothermy includes limb length (many dinosaurs possessed comparatively long limbs) and bipedalism, both found today only in endotherms. Many bipedal dinosaurs possessed gracile leg bones with a short thigh relative to calf length. This is generally an adaptation to frequent sustained <b>running,</b> <b>characteristic</b> of endotherms which, unlike ectotherms, are capable of producing sufficient energy to stave off the onset of anaerobic metabolism in the muscle.|$|E

30|$|Complex {{network theory}} is an {{effective}} tool to study topological and kinetic properties of network [8]. Power grid is a complex network [9, 10]. Most of available methods for evaluating node importance of power grid are based on complex network theory. In [4, 5], the change of the weighted network agglomeration after node contraction {{is defined as the}} index of node importance. Considering topology and power injection, an improved model is propose based on complex network theory for evaluating node importance of power grid in [11].

The extended betweenness and net-ability drop are defined as indexes of node importance with consideration of electric distance, power transfer distribution factor and line flow limit in [13]. In above methods, power grid is abstracted as a weighted and undirected graph. The weights of edges are given according to reactance parameters of transmission lines. The above methods evaluate node importance {{from the perspective of the}} topology of power grid to a greater extent, such as degree, betweenness and network agglomeration.

40|$|In practice, the {{performance}} evaluation of supercomputers is still substantially driven by singlepoint estimates of metrics (e. g., MFLOPS) obtained by <b>running</b> <b>characteristic</b> benchmarks or workloads. With the {{rapid increase in}} the use of time-shared multiprogramming in these systems, such measurements are clearly inadequate. This is because multiprogramming and system overhead, as well as other degradations in performance due to time varying characteristics of workloads, are not taken into account. In multiprogrammed environments, multiple jobs and users can dramatically increase the amount of system overhead and degrade {{the performance}} of the machine. Performance techniques, such as benchmarking, which characterize performance on a dedicated machine ignore this major component of true computer performance. Due to the complexity of analysis, there has been little work done in analyzing, modeling, and predicting the performance of applications in multiprogrammed environments. This is especially true for parallel processors, where {{the costs and benefits of}} multi-user workloads are exacerbated. While some may claim that the issue of multiprogramming is not a viable one in the supercomputer market, experience shows otherwise. Even in recent massively parallel machines, multiprogramming is a key component. It has even been claimed that a partial cause of the demise of the CM 2 was the fact that it did not efficiently support time-sharing. In the same paper, Gordon Bell postulates that, multicomputers will evolve to multiprocessors in order to support efficient multiprogramming. Therefore, it is clear that parallel processors of the future will be required to offer the user a time-shared environment with reasonable response times for the applications. In this type of environment, the most important performance metric is the completion of response time of a given application. However, there are a few evaluation efforts addressing this issue...|$|E

Heil, FACSM 3 1 Montana State University/Montana Overland Research Foundation, Bozeman, MT, 2 University of Hull, Kingston-upon-Hull, United Kingdom, 3 Montana State University, Bozeman, MT Numerous indices relate {{heat stress}} {{to changes in}} {{physical}} performance, but many are too complex to be practical for field use, or in cases where clothing creates a microclimate distinct from ambient conditions. The Physiological Strain Index (PSI), however, requires only rectal temperature (Tre) and heart rate (HR) data, and {{has been shown to}} be accurate in predicting composite heat stress in a variety of conditions. This case study - in which a 37 -year old male professional firefighter in the UK ran the 2015 Humber Bridge Half Marathon while wearing his full firefighting kit - allowed us to collect data needed to examine the relationship between PSI (as a measure of overall physiological stress) and changes in half-marathon <b>running</b> <b>characteristics.</b> PURPOSE: To describe the relationship between PSI and changes in half-marathon <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> in full firefighting kit. METHODS: A GPS-enabled heart rate monitor (HRM) and a rectal temperature probe were fitted to the subject, who wore his full kit of non-breathable turnout coat and pants, leather boots, helmet, and breathing apparatus (full-face mask, hoses, air tank). The subject planned to walk (not run) up hills and change air cylinders at 2. 4 km intervals, or as needed. Heart rate (HR), speed, and distance were recorded every two seconds. Tre was recorded when air cylinders were changed. Post hoc calculation of Tre progression and PSI were then descriptively compared to changes in running characteristics: Mean Speed (MSp), Run Time/Walk Time Ratio (RWR), and Run/Walk Oscillation Rate (OR). RESULTS: Despite the generally cool ambient conditions (17. 1 °C, 80 % humidity), the subject’s Mean PSI climbed steadily from 3. 6 to 9. 5 (on a scale of 0 - 10) over the course of the event. Peak MSp of 7. 4 kph was reached near the 9 km mark, at which time the calculated PSI was 8. 7, while RWR was 5. 9, and OR remained at 2 cycles per segment (cps, with a segment defined as a section of the course covered between cylinder changes or rest breaks). From this point on, MSp and RWR declined steadily while OR increased from 2 cps to 10. These waves of rising speed and PSI - followed by dropping speed and PSI - became more prominent, especially as PSI neared 10. 0, indicating that a physiological limit had been reached that required alteration of <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> in order to maintain forward progress. CONCLUSION: PSI was shown be closely related to observed changes in <b>running</b> <b>characteristics.</b> Given its ease of use, and its applicability in varied environments, further investigation into the use of PSI as a predictor of impending performance change is warranted, especially where the maintenance of set performance characteristics is crucial...|$|R

However, a limitation of these commercial devices {{is the use of}} wires to transmit data from the foot sensor to an on-body data logger and from there to a computer. Aims and Objectives: The primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess the impact of a wireless prototype footwear telemetry antenna system on gait and <b>running</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The secondary aim of this study was to assess the impact of the FScan plantar {{pressure measurement}} system on gait and <b>running</b> <b>characteristics.</b> The impact of these technologies on gait characteristics was tested on a population of healthy adults, and a community-dwelling elderly population at low risk of falling. The impact of these technologies on <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> was tested on a population of healthy adults only. Methods: A same-subject repeated measures experimental design was used for both phases of this study. The first phase of this study examined the impact of both technologies on gait and <b>running</b> <b>characteristics</b> in an injury-free adult population, while the second phase examined the impact of both technologies on gait characteristics in a community-dwelling elderly population at low risk of falling. Healthy adult subjects (n = 26) were recruited from the staff and student population at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI), sixteen of whom participated in the gait arm of this study and ten of whom participated in the running arm of this study. Community-dwelling subjects at low risk of falling (n = 16) were also recruited from a local retirement group centre and participated in the gait arm of this study. A Vicon motion analysis system was used to capture and analyse gait and running data under three counterbalanced test conditions; 1. Walking or running with no device attached to the body; 2. Walking or running wearing the F-Scan system and 3. Walking or running wearing the prototype system. Results: There were significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the spatiotemporal characteristics of healthy adults 2 ̆ 7 gait and running when wearing the prototype footwear telemetry antenna system was compared to having no device attached to the body. There were no significant differences in the spatiotemporal characteristics of gait in elderly community-dwelling individuals at low risk of falling when walking with the prototype system was compared to walking with no attached device for all parameters (p 3 ̆e 0. 08). There were significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the spatiotemporal characteristics of healthy adults 2 ̆ 7 gait and running when wearing the F-Scan system was compared to having no device attached to the body. It was also found that there were significant differences (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in the spatiotemporal characteristics of gait in elderly community-dwelling individuals at low risk of falling when walking with the F-Scan system was compared to walking with no attached device. Although significant differences were found when comparing both devices to walking or running with no attached device, the magnitude of these differences was found to be very small, and therefore, not clinically meaningful. Conclusions and Implications: The prototype footwear telemetry antenna system did not hinder gait or running and therefore, has the potential to be a plantar pressure measurement device with considerable clinical and research utility given the lack of wires necessary to transmit data from ankle to waist or computer. However, further research is necessary to validate this system by comparing real time baropodometric data with that of a force plate platform during gait, and the FScan system during both gait and running prior to clinical and research use. Similarly, the F-Scan system does not hinder gait or running and is therefore, a suitable clinical and research device to measure plantar pressure representative of natural walking in a healthy adult and an elderly community-dwelling population, and natural running in a healthy adult population...|$|R
