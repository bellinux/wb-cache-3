Compounding the problem, Apple initially would not <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> batteries. The official policy was that the customer should buy a refurbished replacement iPod, at a cost almost equivalent to a brand new one. All lithium-ion batteries lose capacity during their lifetime even when not in use (guidelines are available for prolonging life-span) and this situation led to a market for third-party battery replacement kits.|$|R
50|$|Multicellular organisms <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> cells through cell {{division}}. In some animals, however, {{cell division}} eventually halts. In humans this occurs, on average, after 52 divisions, {{known as the}} Hayflick limit. The cell is then referred to as senescent. Cells stop dividing because the telomeres, protective bits of DNA {{on the end of}} a chromosome required for replication, shorten with each copy, eventually being consumed. Cancer cells, on the other hand, are not thought to degrade in this way, if at all. An enzyme called telomerase, present in large quantities in cancerous cells, rebuilds the telomeres, allowing division to continue indefinitely.|$|R

There {{is no need}} to <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> developer, as the user effectively replaces it along with the toner. An alternative developing system, developed by KIP from an abandoned line of research by Xerox, completely replaces magnetic toner manipulation and the cleaning system, with a series of computer-controlled, varying biases. The toner is printed directly onto the drum, by direct contact with a rubber developing roller which, by reversing the bias, removes all the unwanted toner and returns it to the developer unit for reuse.|$|R

25|$|Around 1935, {{development}} of a version suitable for tanks was begun. This was called the M-17T and 7951 were built from 1936 to 1939. The advent of the Mikulin AM-34, which {{was intended as a}} replacement for the M-17, reduced the need for aircraft models and the Rybinsk factory was producing three tank engines for every aircraft engine by 1936, although production of the aircraft variants continued until the end of 1939 to <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> engines on older aircraft. The M-17L was a version of the M-17T used to power the T-35 heavy tank and was the last model placed into production, 530 being built from 1940 to 1941. A number of engines of various models were assembled from spare parts during World War II, but no records are available as to numbers and types.|$|R
40|$|Energy {{economists have}} long {{recognized}} {{the fact that}} changes in energy prices can affect the demand for energy in several ways (e. g., see Fisher and Kaysen, 1962; Taylor, 1975). In the short run, energy users can change their utilization of a fixed appliance stock or a fixed set of capital equipment. In the long run, a user may change the makeup of his appliance stock by purchasing appliances he has never owned in the past, allowing certain appliances to retire unreplaced, and <b>replacing</b> <b>worn-out</b> devices with new ones of different operating efficiencies or of different fuel-using types. Recent works by economists have focused upon these various aspects of energy usage.

5|$|On 13 April 1912, Benedetto Brin and {{the rest}} of the Squadron sailed from Tobruk to the Aegean Sea to {{rendezvous}} with the 1st Squadron. The two squadrons met off Stampalia on 17 April. The next day, the fleet steamed into the northern Aegean and cut several Turkish submarine telegraph cables. Most of the ships of the Italian fleet then bombarded the fortresses protecting the Dardanelles in an unsuccessful attempt to lure out the Turkish fleet. While they were doing this, Regina Margherita, Benedetto Brin, and two torpedo boats were detached to cut additional cables between Rhodes and Marmaris. In July, Benedetto Brin {{and the rest}} of the division had withdrawn to Italy to <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> gun barrels, along with other repairs.

5000|$|Boardman {{is leading}} {{an effort to}} augment and replace Amtrak's fleet of {{high-speed}} Acela Express trains with about 28 new trainsets. The company issued a RfP (request for proposals) in December, 2013. Offers were due by May, 2014, with negotiations likely to continue {{until the end of}} the year before a contract can be signed. The new trains would substantially increase capacity on the Northeast Corridor, where Amtrak shows an operating profit. Major new orders of equipment include 70 electric locomotives for the Regionals and the long-distance trains operating over the Northeast Corridor. Another is for 130 Viewliner II diners, crew dorm-baggage cars, sleepers, and baggage cars to <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> [...] "Heritage" [...] equipment (built before Amtrak was formed in 1971) for the Eastern long-distance trains. The first of the ACS-64 electric locomotives entered service on February 7, 2014. The Viewliner II cars should begin entering service later in the year.|$|R

50|$|STE was {{organized}} in 1947, {{to replace the}} privately run Compañía de Tranvías de México (Mexico City Tramways Company), operator of the city's tramway/streetcar network, but did not completely take over the assets and operations of that company until October 1952. STE also took over the Compañía de Ferrocarriles del Distrito Federal (Mexico City Railways Company) at that time. The agency introduced its first trolleybus route in 1951. To <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> streetcars, STE acquired 274 used PCC cars from U.S. transit companies that were downsizing or abandoning their streetcar systems. Similarly, as it expanded its trolleybus network, the agency turned to American and Canadian transit companies as a relatively inexpensive source of vehicles, acquiring almost 800 secondhand trolleybuses from several different cities in those countries between 1956 and 1977 and later 37 from Edmonton in 1987. These have all since been replaced by trolleybuses built new, in Mexico, by Mexicana de Autobuses SA (MASA) or its successor, Volvo.|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis {{is a case}} study of the debate over the decision of the United States Government to procure the McDonnell Douglas AV- 8 B Advanced Harrier V/STOL jet aircraft for the U. S. Marine Corps. It includes a history of the develop­ment of the AV- 8 A Harrier, the development of the Marine Corps' concept of employment of V/STOL aircraft, and the development of the AV- 8 B. The study centers around the ac­tions taken by the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Department of the Navy, the U. S. Navy, the U. S. Marine Corps, and the Congress of the United states in the controversy over the AV- 8 B during the period 1977 - 1980. That controversy was over the decision to equip the Marine light attack force during the 1980 's with either the AV- 8 B Advanced Harrier or the A- 18 Hornet to <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> A- 4 M Skyhawks and AV- 8 A Harriers.

5000|$|Gasoline-powered vehicles, {{also known}} as [...] "fuelies" [...] or [...] "gassers", run on a mix of {{gasoline}} and oil. They cost much more (usually $800-$3000 RTR) than nitro and electric cars. They are also much bigger and therefore require much more space to run. They do not usually have as high top end speeds (compared to nitro and some electrics) but have lots of power and do not {{take a lot of}} fuel to run. Over time the cost of a gas-powered car can be less than some nitro-powered vehicles, because of the high cost of nitro fuel and buying new nitro engines to <b>replace</b> <b>worn-out</b> ones. In addition, gas-powered motors rarely if ever require tuning and have a very long lifespan. These gas-powered vehicles really pertain to the individual who is more interested in scale than imagination. These large scale models have been popular in Europe for over a decade and have recently become very popular in the US thanks to companies like HPI Racing and FG Modelsport producing affordable high quality models locally. HPI Racing is the most known gasoline-powered RC car maker, because they have engineered one of the best gas powered rc cars which is the HPI Baja 5B.|$|R
