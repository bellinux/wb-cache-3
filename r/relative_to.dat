5|$|A scheme {{introduced}} by a 2005 {{report from the}} Deep Ecliptic Survey by J. L. Elliott et al. distinguishes between two categories: scattered-near (i.e. typical SDOs) and scattered-extended (i.e. detached objects). Scattered-near objects are those whose orbits are non-resonant, non-planetary-orbit-crossing and have a Tisserand parameter (<b>relative</b> <b>to</b> Neptune) less than 3. Scattered-extended objects have a Tisserand parameter (<b>relative</b> <b>to</b> Neptune) greater than 3 and have a time-averaged eccentricity greater than 0.2.|$|E
5|$|A {{secondary}} control input that the rider can make is to lean the upper torso <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the bike. As mentioned above, {{the effectiveness of}} rider lean varies inversely with {{the mass of the}} bike. On heavy bikes, such as motorcycles, rider lean mostly alters the ground clearance requirements in a turn, improves the view of the road, and improves the bike system dynamics in a very low-frequency passive manner. In motorcycle racing, leaning the torso, moving the body, and projecting a knee {{to the inside of the}} turn <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the bike can also cause an aerodynamic yawing moment that facilitates entering and rounding the turn.|$|E

5|$|One {{aspect of}} the Carolinian method of {{estimating}} longitude on inter-island sailings is to visualize the target island <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> a second reference island's alignment with a succession of selected stars, points of the star compass.

5|$|The 2:3 {{resonance}} {{between the}} two bodies is highly stable, and is preserved over millions of years. This prevents their orbits from changing <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> one another, and so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto's orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide. The long term stability of the mean-motion resonance is due to phase protection. If Pluto's period is slightly shorter than 3/2 of Neptune its orbit <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> Neptune will drift, causing it to make closer approaches behind Neptune's orbit. The strong gravitational pull {{between the two}} causes angular momentum {{to be transferred to}} Pluto, at Neptune's expense. This moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it travels slightly more slowly, according to Kepler's third law. After many such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently slowed, and Neptune sufficiently sped up, that Pluto orbit <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> Neptune drifts in the opposite direction until the process is reversed. The whole process takes about 20,000 years to complete.|$|E

5|$|The LIRGs that host {{hydroxyl}} megamasers may {{be distinguished}} {{from the general population}} of LIRGs by their molecular gas content. The majority of molecular gas is molecular hydrogen, and typical hydroxyl megamaser hosts have molecular gas densities greater than 1000cm−3. These densities are among the highest mean densities of molecular gas among LIRGs. The LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers also have high fractions of dense gas <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> typical LIRGs. The dense gas fraction is measured by the ratio of the luminosity produced by hydrogen cyanide (HCN) <b>relative</b> <b>to</b> the luminosity of carbon monoxide (CO).|$|E
