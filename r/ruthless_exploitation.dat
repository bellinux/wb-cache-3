25|$|The First Peace of Thorn {{ending the}} Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War {{was signed in}} the city in February 1411 leaving the town {{in the hands of}} the Order. In 1440, the gentry of Thorn formed the Prussian Confederation to further oppose the Knights' policies. The Confederation rose against the Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in 1454 and its {{delegation}} submitted a petition to Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon asking him to regain power over Prussia as the rightful ruler. An act of incorporation was signed in Kraków (6 March 1454), recognizing the region, including Toruń, as part of the Polish Kingdom. These events led to the Thirteen Years' War. The New and the Old Towns amalgamated in 1454. The citizens of Thorn enraged by the Order's <b>ruthless</b> <b>exploitation,</b> conquered the Teutonic castle, and dismantled the fortifications brick by brick, except for the Gdanisko tower, which was used until the 18th century for the gunpowder storage. During the war, Toruń financially supported the Polish Army. The Thirteen Years' War ended in 1466 with the Second Peace of Thorn, in which the Teutonic Order ceded their control over the city to Poland. The Polish King granted the town great privileges, similar to those of Gdańsk. In 1501, Polish King John I Albert died in Toruń and his heart was buried in Toruń's St. John's Church. In 1506 Toruń became a royal city of Poland. In 1528, the royal mint started operating in Toruń. A city of great wealth and influence, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period. Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were held in Toruń in 1576 and 1626.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the occupation of}} Serbia during the First World War by Austro-Hungarian forces. The first partial occupation was short-lived as the Serbian army repelled the aggressors after the Battle of Kolubara in late 1914, but the second one lasted from fall 1915 {{until the end of}} the Great War. The Austro-Hungarian occupation zone in Serbia covered the largest share of Serbia’s territory and it was organised in the shape of the Military Governorate on the pattern of Austro-Hungarian occupation of part of Poland. The invaders did not reach a clear decision as to what to do with Serbian territory in post-war period and that gave rise to considerable frictions between Austro-Hungarian and German interests in the Balkans, then between Austrian and Hungarian interests and, finally, between military and civilian authorities within Military Governorate. Throughout the occupation Serbia was exposed to <b>ruthless</b> economic <b>exploitation</b> and her population suffered much both from devastation and from large-scale repression (including deportations, internments and denationalisation) on the part of the occupation regime...|$|R
40|$|A unique genetic {{history and}} make-up of a {{population}} may make it an attractive research target for population geneticists and pharmaco-genomic investors. The promise of pharmaceutical profits and advances in medical knowledge attracted Harvard researchers and the company Millennium Pharmaceuticals to remote areas in Anhui Province, Central China, leading to international diplomatic disagreements about {{issues such as the}} ownership of genetic material and informed consent (IC). This article discusses the role of genomics and genetic sampling in China, the way it is related to population policies (the new eugenics), the national importance of genetic materials and the conflicts it led to between the Chinese government and Harvard University. Here many consider the Xu Xiping case as a textbook example of <b>ruthless</b> Western <b>exploitation</b> of development countries, illustrating the cold rationality of science in the process of globalisation. Ten perspectives on this case show that this view is simplistic and contributes little to an understanding of bioethical issues important to the population actually donating the samples. Viewing the Xu Xiping case as the nexus of the intertwinement of international, transnational, national, and local interest groups shows how different interest groups make use of different units of analysis. It also clarifies why the same practice of genetic sampling continues under a different regime, and why the discussion about genetic sampling has shifted from a concern with health care of the poor to an issue of international exploitation, terrorism and development...|$|R

40|$|The legitimity of the one-party {{regimes in}} Soviet type {{societies}} {{was based on}} the guarantee of providing social security to all members of the society. As the result of the collapse of these regimes, the population of postcommunist countries was seized by the fear of pauperization, <b>ruthless</b> capitalist <b>exploitation,</b> anomie, moral degradation, crime rise, etc. It has tried to find rescue from this fear in the warm bosom of ethnic groups. The devastating consequences of postcommunist ethnic nationalisms suggest that the citizens of postcommunist countries need other cultural, normative and institutional orientations as the bases of their self-respect and self-confidence. This need can be satisfied in various types of communities. The article summarizes the communitarian arguments in tavor of this thesis. Since, according to these arguments, belonging to a community is a sine qua non of the very morality and dignity of man, modern liberaldemocratic societies have to be understood as communities of communities. In order to guarantee the cohesion of these societies, procedural rules have to be supplemented by a number of substantive core values. The understanding of modern political societies has a far-reaching impact upon the idea of civil society: its increased complexity and fragmentation, mediated interactions between citizens and the state, public sphere as the medium of discussions among communities — especially about their universalist claims and the “politics of difference”, etc. Proceeding from this argumentation, some elements of the optium type of civil society for the postcommunist countries in Europe are proposed: A broad spectrum of communities and associations, deliberations upon the criteria of priority concerning their promotion, high respect for the liberal and democratic constitution, equality of all citizens, rule of law, welfare etc. These elements promise to promote a society in which free citizens constitute a “we” including all of them, enabling them to peacefully live and act within their respective associations and communities...|$|R
40|$|The 17 th- 19 th century French Canadian fur {{traders and}} interpreters called coureurs de bois and later voyageurs were {{known for their}} {{independence}} of spirit and connection to the wilds. They {{can also be seen}} as an ecocritical motif because, in addition to participating in the environmentally abusive fur trade, they also show the way forward through intercultural connections and business relationships with Amerindians. The four novels analyzed here [...] Taché's Forestiers et voyageurs: Moeurs et légendes canadiennes (1863); Hémon's Maria Chapdelaine (1916); Desrosiers' Les Engagés du Grand Portage (1938); and Maillet's Pélagie-la-Charrette (1979) [...] portray woodsmen operating in a collaborative mode within the realistic context of the need to make money. They participated in both <b>ruthless</b> capitalist <b>exploitation</b> and greater intercultural acceptance, as exemplified in Desrosiers' two opposing main characters. They entered folklore through the 19 th century literary efforts of Taché and others to construct a distinct French Canadian national identity, then in an unstable and continually disrupted process of formation. Because coureurs linked the natural and human worlds as well as radically different human cultures, their entry into literature involved their Amerindian business partners, thus making intercultural connections an aspect of the national identity that Taché strove to construct and mirror. From a modern perspective, such cultural intersections pertain to the ecocritical acknowledgment of the need to respect global populations' widely varying modes of survival. Serres' Contrat naturel offers a broader proposal: that the human population, from the position of its diverse needs and power over the environment, should reach a silent contract {{with the rest of the}} planet that also acknowledges and respects its needs. The coureurs de bois and voyageurs portrayed in the works studied here embody both the problem and the way forward. They and their Amerindian partners occupy the perhaps unique position of contributing to environmental damage as well as greater understanding of the cultural other, which holds the promise of collaboration and the joint search for realistic solutions. Thus, in ways both positive and negative, coureurs de bois and voyageurs, far from perfect models, continue to serve as guides, even in today's tremendously diverse field of ecocriticism...|$|R
