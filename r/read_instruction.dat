40|$|Describes how the {{concepts}} of literacy and initial <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> developed in Brazilian education throughout the last two decades, characterising this development as a progressive invention of the word and concept of literacy and a concomitant dis-invention {{of the concept of}} initial <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> which lost its specific characteristics, bringing about a new type of school failure: the serious reading and writing difficulties among students at advanced levels of schooling. The text discusses the causes of this phenomenon and stresses the need to distinguish clearly between initial <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> and literacy, so that each process is seen as specific and, at the same time, as associated with and dependent on the other. The present situation is characterised as an attempt to re-invent initial <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> meaning not a turning back to past methodologies, but as a recovery of the distinctive features of the initial <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> process in its multiple facets, guaranteeing at the same time its integration with the literacy process...|$|R

Reading instruction for both groups began at the same time. After <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> had ceased for each group, an additional ten-week period had been given for both groups to see if the reading skills which were taught during intensive and less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> had been maintained. Materials, techniques, and methods to be used in this study had been initially prepared and refined in a pilot study. Through lectures and demonstrations, through assigned reading practices and independent reading, development and improvement of word recognition, vocabulary, spelling, comprehension, reading rate, reading for general and specific purposes, and study skills have been sought. The purpose of instruction was to make each reading activity so clear that success was assured. The hypothesis of this study was {{that there will be no}} differences in the total reading performance between one group of community college students using the intensive corrective reading approach and a second group using the less intensive corrective reading approach. The hypothesis was tested by 70 community college students in two experimental groups, one group using the intensive and the other group using the less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction.</b> Findings and Conclusions 1. Mean differences and the associated t values indicated that the results between intensive and less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> at the end of the 10 - and 20 -week periods did not appear to be significantly different at the. 05 level of confidence between Groups 1 and 2. The Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms A and B, were used as standardized instruments to measure reading improvement, 2. The single factor of time between the lessons differentiating intensive and less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> did not appear to be a significant influence on the effectiveness of corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction.</b> Mean differences did not indicate significant superiority of either procedure. It would appear, at least within the 10 - and 20 -weeks of instruction, that the intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> is as effective as the less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction.</b> However, a difference between immediate post-test and delayed post-test for Group 2 was significant at the. 01 level of confidence in total reading. Apparently, less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> has produced a significantly better performance in total reading for Group 2 at the time of the delayed post-test. 3. Corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> carried out in this study did appear to make a difference in students' reading performance between pre-tests and immediate and delayed post-tests as well as between immediate and delayed post-tests of Groups 1 and 2. The differences which appeared for both groups between pre-tests and immediate and delayed post-tests of the Nelson-Denny Reading Test, Forms A and B, and A in vocabulary, comprehension, total reading, and reading rate were all statistically significant at the. 001 level of confidence. 4. When immediate and delayed post-test scores were compared for Group 1 a significant difference at the. 01 level was found in total reading and a significant difference at the. 05 level was found in vocabulary. When immediate and delayed post-test scores were compared for Group 2 significant differences at the. 001 level were found in vocabulary and total reading and significant difference at the. 01 level was found in comprehension. Students' individual improvement as a result of corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> and the retainment of the reading skills has been assessed for both groups by using the residual gain statistics, both the computational and the graphical method. Reading improvement resulted apparently from teaching and student effort regardless of the time during which intensive and less intensive corrective <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> was taught. Evidence from this study indicates that many more community college students might be given the opportunity to participate in <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> if <b>reading</b> courses were taught intensively as, for example, five hours per week for ten weeks rather than extending less intensive <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> over a longer period of time...|$|R

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMPUTER-ASSISTED READING INSTRUCTION, COMPREHENSION AND LEARNING APPROACHES BY PUPILS IN THE SENIOR PRIMARY PHASE. The {{aim of the}} {{research}} was primarily to determine in which way, if any, the reading comprehension of learners with a surface and a deep learning approach, is influenced differently" by using a specific computer-assisted <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> programme. Secondly, it was established to which extent the programme influenced the reading ability of learners in the senior primary school phase as manifested in reading comprehension and word recognition, in comparison with classical <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> using exclusively printed text. As basis of the empirical research, Solomon's four group design was used. A standardised test was used to determine the reading comprehension of pupils who were used, and their learning approach was measured by means of an existing questionnaire which was adapted. Observations in {{the research}}, as well as quantitative results were qualitatively analysed and discussed. Several factors, however, obviated that a meaningful connection between computer-assisted <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> with the specific programme and the learners' learning approach, could not be found with absolute certainty. Meaningful correlations, however, were found in the reading comprehension achievement of learners with a surface approach, and who had received computer-assisted <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> in comparison with the other groups in the experiment. Learners with a deep approach, who had received computer-assisted <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> showed statistically meaningful improvement within the group as regards feelings and achievement. No statistically meaningful improvement in reading comprehension achievement took place in the group who received extra <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> without the use of a computer.

When doubling the work of a simple benchmark program, that was run on a single core of Tilera’s TILEPro 64 processor, did not double the number of consumed cycles, a mystery was unveiled. After ruling out different levels of optimization for the two programs, a cycleaccurate simulation attributed the sub-optimal performance to an abnormally high number of L 1 data cache misses. Further investigation showed that the processor stalled on every Read-After-Write instruction sequence when the following two conditions were met: 1) there are 0 or 1 instructions between the write and the <b>read</b> <b>instruction</b> and 2) the read and the write instructions target distinct memory locations that share an L 1 cache line.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the teaching of reading in introductory composition textbooks, popular sources of writing pedagogy in undergraduate composition classrooms. Much research on complex reading skills remains to be done, especially regarding postsecondary education. The present study is designed to contribute to this research by exploring what kinds of reading skills are being taught and how students are being instructed to use these skills. The study examines features found in seven introductory composition textbooks representing six thematic approaches to composition instruction: reader, rhetoric, argument textbook, cultural studies textbook, writing-across-the-curriculum textbook, and reading-oriented textbook. Using quantitative and qualitative methodology, the study reports findings on an axis of <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> treatment that includes what the focus is regarding the reading treatment and what the manner is in which students are asked to treat the reading. The research uncovers four different foci being used in the textbooks: form, content, context, and process. It also uncovers nine different manners of instruction: imperative, explicative, directive, attentive, expressive, interpretive, evaluative, projective, and comparative used in either general <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> which entails broad guidance in reading, or applied <b>reading</b> <b>instruction,</b> which entails instruction that pertains only to particular texts or “readings” in the textbooks. Most of the applied <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> is focused on content, while general <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> shows a more balanced representation between the four foci. Most <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> is directive in manner regarding general reading and interpretive in manner regarding applied reading. These results are discussed in terms of treatments within each textbook as well as comparison between the types of textbooks. Results are also discussed in terms of the scope of certain types of <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> to be found in introductory composition textbooks and how useful the study methodology is as a way of examining <b>reading</b> <b>instruction</b> in composition pedagogy. ...|$|R
