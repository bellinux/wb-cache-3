40|$|This paper {{provides}} an empirical {{study of the}} effectiveness of hedging the spider (or SPDR). a passive exchange traded fund (ETF) that replicates the S&P 500 index. The spider is by far the largest ETF in the world: Trading on the spider has grown so much {{during the past few years}} that it is now amongst the few most traded securities in the AMEX. The large net daily creation and <b>redemption</b> <b>orders</b> of recent years pose a problem to the market makers in the spider, as the orders may be too large to execute in the cash market. They face a decision about whether to hedge spider positions on their own book, and if so, how should they hedge? We have employed several sophisticated minimum variance estimates for the futures hedge ratio, including OLS regression, an ECM to account for maturity effects and the cointegration of the spot and the future prices, and to the ECM residuals we apply EWMA and number of bivariate GARCH models to account for time-variation in the hedge ratio. We have applied these models to daily data for a one-day rebalancing frequency and to weekly data for a five-day rebalancing frequency, using data since the spider's inception until the end of 2004. Marginal differences in the "optimal" hedge ratios are apparent, but they are simply too small to have any significant effect on the hedged portfolio volatility. In out-of-sample testing, we find that the naive hedge, where an equal and opposite position is taken in futures, performs as well as the more technically sophisticated models at both the daily and the weekly re-balancing frequency. Finally, we have considered the differences between hedging the spot index and hedging the spider. The efficiency of hedging the spider is superior to that of the index and the spider hedged portfolios have significantly lower volatility than the spot index hedged portfolio...|$|R

Recent theoretical approaches reveal how European identity narratives require hybrid multilayered configurations in order to accommodate national, ethnic and cultural features, as well as post-national political and economic unification. This paper attempts to explore some processes of identity construction in an European context and to discuss how elements that embody the ambiguity that runs through European culture - unity and diversity, commemoration and forgetfulness - are registered in the social memory...|$|R

40|$|This thesis theorises an {{approach}} to cinematic suspense derived from a set of films that challenge the teleological and redemptive principles of traditional narrative. It is argued that such a challenge is drawn from the need to account for conditions of violence and suffering without recourse to the traditional grounds of redemption. They set out to question the symbols that underpin a faith in its possibilities. Such films counter these grounds with a form of perpetuated suspense that continually withholds resolution, stressing and destabilising both the terms of redemption and the affect of its aesthetic representations. Significantly, this thesis examines films from the years following 1989 that confront this central theme within conditions of historical hiatus and the disintegration of ideological certainties occurring {{in the wake of}} European communism. These films, by Kira Muratova, Béla Tarr, Artur Aristakisyan, Alexander Sokurov, Bruno Dumont, Roy Andersson, Ulrich Seidl and Gus Van Sant, present a world in which human beings are always already turned against themselves, placing them in the context of contemporary philosophical aporias that identify the human condition as enigmatic and resisting of itself. They suspend the symbolic structures associated with <b>redemption</b> in <b>order</b> to reconfigure contemporary film as a „realist‟ cinema at the threshold of the interpretative and reconciliatory economies implicit in the soteriological mythology of Western thought. Tracing Paul Ricoeur‟s schematic account of the symbols and myths of a „fallen‟ world, the thesis turns on Jean-Luc Nancy‟s subsequent critique of the insufficiency of myths to properly account for existence. In place of an hermeneutic recovery of the real and its meaning, Nancy‟s „realist‟ philosophy of „sense‟ and its application to the cinema offer an account that speaks less of conflicting narratives of redemption than a radical stripping away of its terms, suggesting that it is redemption from the normative terms of redemption that ultimately constitutes the proper question at the heart of these films...|$|R

40|$|The overall {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{illuminate}} and critically evaluate Christian theology of atonement and <b>redemption,</b> in <b>order</b> to contribute to contemporary theology of atonement and redemption. The purpose is reached through {{an analysis of the}} work of two contemporary feminist theologians; Daphne Hampson and Rita Nakashima Brock. Hampson has formulated a sharp post-Christian position. Brock has distinguished herself through her critique of the Christian concept of atonement and through her contributions to reconciliation and redemption. Both Daphne Hampson and Rita Nakashima Brock argue that Christian atonement-theology, primarily the so called objective model, is hurtful to children and victims of abuse and violence. They both argue that theological language is not innocent. At the same time, they illustrate broken relationships, sufferings, and problems they want to change, give theological interpretations of how that change is to take place and present methodologies on how to reach reconciliation between human beings and God as well as between human beings. In two steps I undertake a critical analysis of content and presuppositions in Daphne Hampson’s and Rita Nakashima Brock’s theologies of atonement and redemption. In the first step, I describe Hampson’s and Brock’s critique of Christian atonement-theology. I analyze their theological critique and theological construction in a model "from-transition-to". My critical analysis focuses especially on internal consistency. In the second part, the analysis of presuppositions, I explain basic principles upon which they shape their theology. The analysis is made up by the analytical concepts; theoretical arguments of knowledge, understandings of faith, and the position of the subject. I also analyze other essential concepts out of which gender is one. In the last chapter I present my own constructive contribution, structured by content and presuppositions. I argue that theology is both a critical and constructive discipline. In the content-response I discuss images of God, the tragic, the cross, and the hope. In the presuppositions-response I discuss the concept "space-in-between". In conclusion I propose that theology of atonement/redemption is shaped between post and Christian. I argue that space-in-between-perspectives are necessarily experimental and critical, a space on the border where marginalized voices are to be included...|$|R
40|$|The mam aim of {{the thesis}} is to explore issues raised by {{teaching}} Paradise Lost in Muslim/multi-faith scenarios. Milton's poem was chosen {{because it is an}} overtly Christian text that is taught across the globe in Higher Education Institutions to students of different cultural and religious backgrounds. In particular, this study analyses the character of Eve and the narrative of creation as presented in Paradise Lost, and explores them both through feminism and Quranic feminism, as well as by a detailed analysis of present-day teaching methodologies as experienced by academics and students in the UK and Pakistan. The first half of the thesis examines relevant critical approaches to Paradise Lost and deals with my own close readings, while {{the second half of the}} thesis investigates the cross- cultural teaching perceptions of academics through interviews and explores Muslim students' experience by the use of questionnaires. No previous research has explored the ways in which Muslim students read and experience Paradise Lost from a religious and cultural perspective, therefore this research as a first full-length study, breaks new ground and examines Pakistani- Muslim and British-Muslim students' attitudes towards this Christian epic. The research focuses on the key issues of Paradise Lost, such as the scenarios pre- and post -fall, the sensuous nudity of Eve, rape, and the concept of <b>redemption,</b> in <b>order</b> to undertake a comparative analysis of Christianity and Islam from the Muslim perspective. As the current political situation between the Muslim and Western worlds has become increasingly fraught, it is critical to look further at the influence of English literature on Muslims in order to deepen trans-cultural and trans-religious understanding and build bridges. The study intends to contribute to that overall aim by suggesting the way in which academics in both the UK and Pakistan could modify the culturally-specific pedagogical approaches when teaching a Christian text to Muslim/multi-faith students. If utilised, this might serve to create a better understanding of the difference between Christian and Islamic literary texts which might, in turn, promote increased reciprocity - not only in academic circles but for the wider political scenario.

40|$|The {{dissertation}} is a {{study of}} Hans Urs von Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s theology of Church and world with special attention given to {{his view of the}} role of laity in the Church 2 ̆ 7 s worldly mission. Balthasar, a German-speaking theologian who died in 1988, has been highly critical of certain attitudes of openness to the world within post-Vatican II Catholic theology. He has increasingly emphasized the opposition between Church and world, highlighting the distinctiveness of Christian identity as compared to worldly forms of existence and calling for rigorous spiritual formation as the prerequisite for the Church 2 ̆ 7 s mission in the world. Balthasar has been a strong promoter of secular institutes because, for him, they give laity the kind of rigorous formation they need for their mission in transforming the world. My study explains and critiques the polarization between Church and world in Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s theology. After an Introduction, the argument of the dissertation unfolds in 6 chapters. Chapters 1 - 4 explicate what I have called a polarization between Church and world in Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s theology. For Balthasar, the salvation brought by Christ and his Church is an eschatological liberation, a 2 ̆ 2 transcendent exodus 2 ̆ 2 (chapter 2) which resolves the enigma of human existence as revealed in Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s tragic anthropology (chapter 1). In his view of nature and grace (chapter 3) Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s accents the extrinsicism between creation and <b>redemption</b> in <b>order</b> to protect the dramatic encounter between God and the world in Jesus Christ. Finally, the polarization between Church and world is evident in Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of the Church 2 ̆ 7 s inner nature as a community radically conformed to Christ as presupposition for its worldly mission (chapter 4). In chapter 5, I examine some of the critiques which have been made of Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s work by theologians who are concerned about developing social theologies. In the final chapter, I explain Balthasar 2 ̆ 7 s view of the secular institute, which he saw as embodying the ideal of a Church both radically following Christ and immersed in the everyday world. In my critical assessment of his view, I argue that his vision of a Church deeply formed by Christ as presupposition for her worldly mission can be accepted but that his interpretation of the secular institute does not accord to ordinary laity a unique and distinctive mission appropriate to their state of life within the Church...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{the crossroads of}} social transformation from the contextual standpoint of the "Second World" - a political and socioeconomic term descriptively pointing to the unique location of the Former Eastern-European Block countries - in between worlds. The work involves in a dialogue {{some of the major}} trends within the contemporary Eastern-European philosophical environment: dichotomized between Neo-Marxism and Neo-Freudianism on the one hand, and Postmodernism on the other. While examining the most significant elements between the dialectical paradigms for social change of the above theories (and their ethical foundations), the text strives towards a theological paradigmatic formulation for an authentic social transformation that draws its dialectical content and passion from the hopeful eschatological vision of Christ and the Kingdom as an embodiment of the Christian alternative for human emancipation and liberation. In light of this, the work attempts to establish the following thesis: the radical Christian praxis of the eschatological reality of the Kingdom in light of the Cross is the Church’s alternative to contemporary philosophies and initiatives for social transformation. This praxis affirms the revolutionary, history-shaping force which makes Christianity relevant to the problems of Modernity and Postmodernity through its self-identification with the Crucified God. It marks the moment of conception of an authentic, liberating, life giving, transforming hope as a source of humanization and <b>redemption</b> of social <b>order.</b> Christianity is concerned with the birth and formation of a new socio-political reality - the Kingdom of God, and its embodiment on earth (through the Holy Spirit) in a new ethnos: the Church, the Body of Christ, the communion of the saints. Therefore, it is the Church's calling and obligation to exemplify the reality of the Kingdom, being a living extension of the living Christ and thus, the incarnation of the eschatological future of the world and its hopeful horizon {{in the midst of the}} present. Recognizing the vital need for a relevant Christian response to the spiritual demands of the Post-modern human being and his/her desacralized, pluralistic socio­ political context, the work concludes with a conceptual outline offering a strategy for the Church in the Postmodern setting.
