In {{the context}} of estate {{planning}} value-added tax (VAT) is particularly of importance to the estate owner who either in his personal capacity is registered as a VAT vendor or who, although not a VAT vendor, conducts an enterprise in his personal capacity {{and in the course}} whereof he makes vatable supplies. In firstmentioned instance the estate owner's deceased estate will upon his demise be a VAT vendor whilst in lastmentioned instance the likelihood exists that the deceased estate will be a VAT vendor. If the deceased estate is a VAT vendor the executor in his capacity as representative VAT vendor will have to account for output tax on the supply of all those assets that were either wholly or partially used in the course or furtherance of the enterprise in respect of which the deceased made vatable supplies. The supply of enterprise assets to purchasers, heirs or legatees constitutes the continuation of the enterprise. In certain instances the deceased estate will have to account for output tax at the standard rate on the open market value of the supply of an asset used {{in the course of the}} enterprise, however, the output tax will not be carried by the direct recipient of the asset but in fact by the deceased estate. The deceased estate will upon paying the output tax from its resources be legally unable to recover same from the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply.</b> In the case of bequests it is, however, possible through the use of a bequest price to either wholly of in part shift the carrying of the output tax from the deceased estate to the heir or legatee. In certain instances the liability upon the deceased estate to pay output tax in respect of enterprise assets supplied to purchasers, heirs or legatees could put a strain upon the deceased estate's cash resources. In might result in other estate assets having to be sold. When this happens the estate planner's carefully laid plans to provide for his dependants and to ensure a smooth administration of his deceased estate could be jeopardized. It requires a careful factual analysis to determine whether a deceased estate would carry output tax liability in respect of the supply of estate assets. VAT does not, however, affect those assets in the deceased estate that were not used in the course or furtherance of the deceased's VAT enterprise. In {{the context of}} estate planning VAT is of no significance to the estate owner who does not in his personal capacity conduct an enterprise which makes vatable supplies. Master...|$|E
40|$|The Other Export Crops {{sector of}} Sri Lanka {{has been growing}} {{over the past few}} years. <b>The</b> {{objective}} <b>of</b> this study was to identify and analyze <b>the</b> interfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain <b>of</b> services provided to the other export crop industry in order to find out <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> service quality on farmer productivity. The study was conducted in the Ukuwela Agrarian Service Division. Service quality was measured based on the Serve-qual model. Data was collected through both primary and secondary sources. Primary data was collected through in-depth interviews, structured questionnaires and stakeholder analysis of both service providers and <b>recipients.</b> Interfaces <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> chain were defined based on the gap between the actual and anticipated service quality levels and experienced service quality level. Nine interfaces were defined. As far as the overall service quality is concerned, five interfaces were moderately satisfactory, two were average and another two problematic. None <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interfaces were highly satisfactory. However a positive relationship was not found between the service quality gap and the farmer productivity, whereas experienced level of service was positively related with farmer productivity. * The authors are, respectively, Final Year Undergraduate Student at the time th...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} value added tax evasions on the fuel {{market in the}} Czech Republic. This {{commodity}} is used in carousel fraud. In <b>the</b> chains <b>of</b> taxpayers there are missing traders who fail to meet their tax obligations. Their business strategy is based on quick sales at unusually low prices which do not allow honest parties to compete. Tax administrators should focus on unusual prices which constitute a higher probability of tax evasions. This paper aims to verify {{whether or not there}} are ways to evade the measure, focusing specifically on applying methods which could help achieve lower sales prices while avoiding the possibility to require unpaid tax from <b>the</b> <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> taxable <b>supply.</b> <b>The</b> weaknesses thus found are described and demonstrated in more detail in the paper. During a research some ways were found which could be used for avoiding this specific measure. Methods of Cash Back and Free Shipping were identified and described...|$|R
40|$|Paragraph 7 (1) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> VAT Act {{provides}} for <b>the</b> charging <b>of</b> VAT at 14 percent on <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> {{goods or services}} by a vendor in the course or furtherance <b>of</b> an ‘enterprise’, <b>the</b> importation into South Africa of goods by any person or <b>the</b> <b>supply</b> <b>of</b> ‘imported services’. <b>The</b> term ‘enterprise’ has been interpreted to require an on-going activity and therefore once off sales should be excluded. The sale must relate to enterprise activities, thereby excluding private sales. Furthermore the enterprise activities are required {{to be carried out}} in the Republic or partly in the Republic. Establishing whether the enterprise activities are carried out in the Republic remains a contentious issue as the VAT Act does not specify the minimum required business activities to meet this criterion. ‘Imported services’ excludes services imported for <b>the</b> purposes <b>of</b> making taxable <b>supplies</b> and <b>the</b> liability <b>of</b> accounting for VAT on ‘imported services’ lies with <b>the</b> <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imported service. <b>Supplies</b> (imported services) which are chargeable in terms of s 7 (1) (a) and supplies, which if made in the Republic, are exempt from VAT or zero rated. ‘Imported services’ definition requires services to be consumed in South Africa. Services offered outside South Africa therefore generally do not qualify as imported services even the South African entity benefits from such services, for example a training course attended in a foreign country. Technological developments in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> e-commerce globally have required countries to examine VAT laws relating to e-commerce. Extensive research has been done by the OECD on this topic, with reports issued on recommendations of how e-commerce should be taxed. Most guidance issued by the OECD on taxing e-commerce relates to indirect electronic commerce, which refers to goods or services where ordering, payment and delivery occur on line. Distinction is drawn between taxation of business-to-business transactions and business-to-consumer transactions. The OECD suggests that the ‘reverse-charge’ or self-assessment method should be applied to <b>the</b> taxing <b>of</b> B 2 B transactions resulting in minimal compliance and administrative costs. It is further recommended that for B 2 C transactions place of consumption should be defined as <b>the</b> <b>recipient’s</b> usual jurisdiction <b>of</b> residence and that non-resident suppliers should be required to register and pay VAT in <b>the</b> jurisdiction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consumer, as this would result in the most effective tax collection method. ‘Enterprise’ includes electronic services from a foreign supplier where the recipient is a resident of South Africa or where the payment originated from a South African bank account. The Minister’s regulation, which came into effect on 1 June 2014, includes the following items in <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> electronic services: educational services, games, online auction services, miscellaneous services and subscription services. The South African VAT legislation draws no distinction between B 2 B and B 2 C <b>supplies</b> <b>of</b> electronic services. <b>The</b> reasoning behind this was to avoid situations in which private customers could pose as business customers in order to avoid <b>the</b> levying <b>of</b> tax. A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> services currently included in the Minister’s regulation on electronic services indicate that services that would relate to B 2 B supplies have mostly been excluded from the regulation. Effectively the South African VAT legislation manages to indirectly exclude B 2 B <b>supplies</b> from <b>the</b> definition <b>of</b> electronic services and therefore achieves <b>the</b> objective <b>of</b> minimising <b>the</b> administrative burden on B 2 B supplie...|$|R
