5000|$|Domestication of the European rabbit rose {{slowly from}} a {{combination}} of game-keeping and animal husbandry. Among the numerous foodstuffs imported by sea to Rome during her domination of the Mediterranean were shipments of rabbits from Spain. Romans also imported ferrets for rabbit hunting, and the Romans then distributed rabbits and the habit of <b>rabbit</b> <b>keeping</b> to the rest of Italy, to France, and then across the Roman Empire, including the British Isles. [...] Rabbits were kept in both walled areas as well as more extensively in game-preserves. In the British Isles, these preserves were known as warrens or garths, and rabbits were known as coneys, to differentiate them from the similar hares (a separate species). [...] The term warren was also used as a name for the location where hares, partridges and pheasants were kept, under the watch of a game keeper called a warrener. In order to confine and protect the rabbits, a wall or thick hedge might be constructed around the warren, or a warren might be established on an island. (see: Rabbit islands) A warrener was responsible for controlling poachers and other predators and would collect the rabbits with snares, nets, hounds (such as greyhounds), or by hunting with ferrets. [...] With the rise of falconry, hawks and falcons were also used to collect rabbits and hares.|$|E
50|$|Intensive cuniculture {{involves}} a greater density of animals {{per unit of}} land and a generally higher rate of reproduction. Labor required for each hide, kilogram of wool or market fryer may be higher or lower than for extensive methods. The amount of supplemented feed is generally higher, and may be grain mixes or a complete pelleted feed. The {{total number of animals}} may be in the thousands or may be less than ten adult animals, depending on the particular operation. Housing may be highly climate controlled (inside housing) or nearly completely outside, with minimal temperature control. Outdoor housing may consist of a single or group of cages, hutches, or lined pits. One example of intensive <b>rabbit</b> <b>keeping</b> may be a household rabbitry of a buck and two does, set under protection from the sun and with a windbreak, where each rabbit had their own cage and are fed fodder that is gathered by family members from the yard or roadside. Another might be a barn that is completely enclosed and climate controlled, to include constant air exchange, where several hundred individually housed does are fed a complete pelleted ration and are subject to weekly weight checks and daily health inspections. While a small rabbitry may make use of solid floors, wire or slat floors are more common in larger barns in order to ensure adequate hygiene. A higher level of routine preventative medical care and a more strict application of biosecurity principles are more common in intensive cuniculture, but the level of clinical intervention on individual animals is unlikely to be high.|$|E

The {{average age of the}} rabbit keepers was 44. 3 years, and 95. 5 % of the keepers had formal education. Most of the producers got into <b>rabbit</b> <b>keeping</b> for money to meet urgent family needs, while household consumption was a major factor influencing the decision for rearing rabbits. Personal savings was the main source of income for the establishment of the rabbit enterprises. The major breeds of rabbits kept were the California White, New Zealand White and crossbreds of varied genetic variations. Backyard, small-scale and medium-scale commercial rabbit holdings were held by 18. 2, 51. 7 and 30. 2 % of the keepers respectively. The average rabbit population per farm was 77. 8, with an average of 8. 4 bucks, 21. 6 does. Young rabbits formed 70. 0 % of the rabbit population. Owners of rabbitries usually cared for their animals as hired labour was expensive and often not available. High cost of feed was the most significant constraint to <b>rabbit</b> <b>keeping,</b> and mange was the most common disease affecting the rabbits. Marketing of rabbits was not organized, and this served as a disincentive to expanding the holdings. The rabbits were mostly sold either life or as fresh carcasses at the farm gate.

40|$|Feed cost {{represents}} about 60 – 70 % of <b>rabbit</b> <b>keeping</b> costs; therefore, maximizing utilization of nutrients {{is essential for}} the profitability and sustainability of rabbit production. Consequently, it has become very necessary to look for locally available, cheap, and nutritionally safe feed additives that would help to cut down production costs and improve production efficiency. Since the European Union banned most of the antibiotic growth promoters in animal nutrition due to cross and multiple resistances, much research has been conducted to explore the use of multi-enzymes as effective substitutes. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the fertility status, milk output, mortality, and body thermoregulation of rabbit does as affected by different levels of multi-enzyme extracts (EZ) in their diets. A total of 120 Hy-Plus rabbit does were divided into four comparable experimental groups (n = 30 does per group). Animals of each group were divided in six pens (five animals per pen), and each pen was used as an experimental unit. The first group was kept untreated and fed a commercial diet alone without enzyme extracts (EZ 0), while the other groups were fed the same diet but supplemented with 1 (EZ 1), 3 (EZ 3), and 5 (EZ 5) kg/ton of enzyme extracts, respectively. Feeding EZ additive increased (P < 0. 05) conception and kindling rates, litter size and weight at birth, and litter size and bunny weight at weaning, with decreasing (P < 0. 05) abortion rate. Moreover, total milk yield increased (P < 0. 05) with increasing level of enzyme supplementation. Pre-weaning mortality decreased (P < 0. 05) with EZ inclusion. Signs of vitality (rectal temperature, skin temperature, earlobe temperature, respiration rate, and pulse rate) were improved with EZ inclusion.

40|$|Introduction. Ecological farming {{occupies}} a special position among various technologies in agriculture. It {{is based on}} modern, environment friendly technologies which do not use synthetic chemical substances (fertilizers, pesticides, drugs, growth enhancers, etc.), but use their substitutes instead. Ecological rabbit breeding is a novelty in Lithuania; however, the observations prove {{that the number of}} those willing to run such farms is increasing. The conditions of <b>rabbit</b> <b>keeping</b> must be as close to natural as possible to assure that the wellbeing and health requirements for the animals are fulfilled. Rabbits must have a possibility to move freely, satisfy their instincts. Goal of research. The research aims to study the digestibility of nutrients in rations used for feeding rabbits with ecological feedstuffs. Method of research. The research has been carried out at the vivariums of Lithuanian Veterinary Academy using New Zealand rabbit breed. To study digestibility 3 groups were formed, 10 rabbits aged 60 days were selected from each group. The rabbits were kept in individual cages and had sufficient of water. The same feedstuffs as on ecological farms were used. The research consisted of the following stages: 1. Adaptation (duration – 3 days); 2. Preparatory stage (duration – 5 days); 3. Collection of faeces and stale (duration – 5 days). Review of research data. The crude protein and raw fat in ration perform a specific function of life-support and production, in case of necessity {{can be used as a}} source of energy. If there is a surplus of protein, after deamination it can be used for production of energy (Hulot et al., 1996). The research on digestibility has demonstrated that the most influenced area was the digestibility of crude protein, raw cell matter. The average intake of feedstuff dry matter is 62 g per 1 kilo of rabbit body mass. The chemical analysis of the meat has shown that the feedstuffs used did not largely affect the quality of the meat. In all the groups the cholesterol level in meat did not exceed the permitted limits (was less than 36 mg/ 100 g). Conclusions. In rabbit breeding on ecological farms the application of complex rations and amino acids obtained from night faeces suffice to satisfy their nutritional needs. The obtained digestibility coefficients of feedstuff nutrients point to a high level of digestion of nutrients, which assures fulfillment of rabbits’ nutritional needs. The proteins in pulses are rich in indispensable amino acids (especially lysine) and their digestibility is better compared to that of grains. Swallowing of night faeces affects the digestibility of nutrients in the ration, especially that of proteins. When caprofagy is incomplete, digestibility of dry matter decreases by 6 %...|$|E
50|$|The {{earliest}} pest exclusion fences in Australia {{were created}} to protect small plots of cropland from the predation by marsupials. In the 1860s and 1870s, introduced rabbit populations began to spread rapidly across southern Australia. By 1884, a rabbit-proof fence was built. Having been unsuccessful at <b>keeping</b> <b>rabbits</b> out, and more successful at keeping out pigs, kangaroos, emus and brumbies, and as more sheep farms were established, the interest for a dingo-proof barriers increased enough that government funds were being used to heighten and expand the fence. In 1930, an estimated 32,000 km of dog netting in Queensland alone was being used on top of rabbit fences. Prior to 1948, {{the idea of a}} Dingo Barrier Fence Scheme had not come into fruition as a statewide project for which annual maintenance and repair were kept. Since this time, there have been pushes to move away from a method of barrier-exclusion to complete extinction of the dingo and wild-dog cross-breeds. Poisoning the species with compound 1080 (sodium monofluoroacetate) baits has been seen as a much cheaper alternative than fence maintenance. A compromise {{in the form of the}} continued use of poison and the shortening of the fence from its previous length of over 8000 km has been made.|$|R

40|$|Rabbits {{behavioural}} {{response to}} climatic and managerial conditions – a review The domestic rabbit is {{deprived of the}} protection of burrows and of a social hierarchy and live in a limited space which is {{a fraction of a}} metre of a hard sanitized space, removed from odours, markers and social interaction. Hot climate was the main cause for abnormal maternal and sexual behaviour. Exposure to high ambient temperature induces rabbits to try to balance their excessive heat load by using different means. The doe that was capable to produce 10 litters a year may give only 4 to 5 litters in hot climate Noise in rabitries causes adverse effects including nervous and behavioural abnormalities and can cause a startled response and traumatic injuries to limbs and back. Particularly, most concern about noise effects has traditionally focused on impairment of reproductive and maternal behaviours, although few controlled studies have been done to support the observations of animal caretakers that noise inhibits production. Moon phases are one of the main causes of abnormal sexual behaviour in females.

Seven focus group discussions with livestock production officers in charge of each major Nairobi sub-county were conducted. Data were collected on the type of systems existing for each livestock species and their supply chains, disease management, food safety risks, and general husbandry and gender factors. Supply chain flow diagrams and thematic analysis of the data was done. Results of the study show a large variability of livestock keeping in Nairobi. The majority were small scale with: < 5 dairy cows, 1 – 6 dairy goats, < 10 small ruminants, < 20 pigs, 200 – 500 broilers, 300 – 500 layers, < 10 indigenous chickens, or < 20 <b>rabbits.</b> Beef <b>keeping</b> was mainly described as a “by the way” system or done by traders to fatten animals for 3 [*]month. Supply chain analysis indicated that most dairy farmers sold milk directly to consumers due to “lack of trust” of these in traders. Broiler and pig farmers sold mainly to traders but are dependent on few large dominating companies for their replacement or distribution of products. Selling directly to retailers or consumers (including own consumption), with backyard slaughtering, were important chains for small-scale pig, sheep and goat, and indigenous chicken keepers. Important disease risk practices identified were associated with consumption of dead and sick animals, with underground network of brokers operating for ruminant products. Qualified trained health managers were used mainly by dairy farmers, and large commercial poultry and pig farmers, while use of unqualified health managers or no treatment were common in small-scale farming. Control of urban livestock keepers was reported difficult due to their “feeling of being outlaws,” “lack of trust” in government, “inaccessibility” in informal settlements, “lack of government funding,” or “understaffing. ” Findings are useful for designing policies to help to control urban livestock production and minimize its associated health and environment risks...|$|R

In this study questionnaire and examination sheets were used to record the information. The results of this research revealed that rabbit farmers in Central, Nairobi and Rift Valley provinces practice small scale farming essentially due to small land space, which if well adopted, can be practiced widely. There was sustained interest in rabbit farming which was shown by {{a large proportion of}} farmers (51 %) who had kept rabbits between 1 and 5 years. The most common breeds of rabbits kept were New Zealand white (73 %), Californian (60 %) and their cross breeds (51 %) which were all suitable for meat production.

However, the pathogenetic role of PVL in staphylococcal infections remains controversial, possibly because {{it depends on the}} site of infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We compared the course of experimental rabbit osteomyelitis due to the PVL-positive CA-MRSA strain USA 300 (LAC) and its PVL-negative isogenic derivative (LACDeltapvl), using a low and a high inoculum (8 x 10 (5) and 4 x 10 (8) CFU). With the low inoculum, bone infection was less frequent on day 7 (D 7) and day 28 (D 28) with LACDeltapvl than with LAC (respectively 12 / 19 and 18 / 19 animals, p = 0. 042). With the high inoculum of both strains, all the animals were infected on D 7 and the infection persisted on D 28 in almost every case. However, tibial bacterial counts and the serum CRP concentration fell significantly between D 7 and D 28 with LACDeltapvl but not with LAC. Respectively 67 % and 60 % of LAC-infected rabbits had bone deformation and muscle/joint involvement on D 7, compared to 0 % and 7 % of LACDeltapvl-infected rabbits (p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 005 respectively).

40|$|In South Australia, {{success in}} control of the European rabbit has been based on an {{understanding}} of rabbit biology and behavior. Drastic population reduction is obtained by use of Compound 1080. This method is much more effective when carried out during midsummer to late autumn. At this time, territorial boundaries are relaxed and the young have been weaned and are feeding aboveground. To ensure that the greatest number of rabbits can receive a lethal dose, it is necessary to pre-feed the population with un-poisoned bait over a period of 8 to 10 days. Oat grain has been chosen as the preferred bait material because of its acceptability and to minimize possible off-target effects. As warrens are an essential factor in rabbit survival, warren destruction is a vital part of any effective control program to prevent a resurgence of the population. Poisoning followed by ripping of warrens and then fumigation provided effective control in the most cost-efficient manner. Warrens can be destroyed with minimal disturbance to areas of valuable native vegetation. By promoting this system of integrated control and by explaining to landholders the biological reasons for its effectiveness, the major rabbit problems of South Australia 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural lands have been overcome. In addition to the improvements in farm productivity in both the short and long term, rabbit control often appears to be an essential tool in the management of native vegetation and native herbivores. In the low-rainfall parts of the state, the low productivity of the land makes it difficult to justify this system of integrated control in terms of cost-efficiency. Ripping of warrens by itself has been shown to provide reasonable control in hilly country with 250 to 300 mm of rainfall, when control takes place late in summer when rabbit numbers are low. However, biological control in the form of myxomatosis provides the most likely means of <b>keeping</b> <b>rabbit</b> numbers at a low level throughout the low-rainfall areas.

5000|$|Extensive cuniculture {{refers to}} the {{practice}} of <b>keeping</b> <b>rabbits</b> at a lower density and a lower production level than intensive culture. Specifically as relates to rabbits, this type of production was nearly universal prior to germ theory understanding of infectious parasites (especially coccidia) and the role of nutrition in prevention of abortion and reproductive loss. The most extensive rabbit [...] "keeping" [...] methods would be the harvest of wild or feral rabbits for meat or fur market, such as occurred in Australia prior to the 1990s. Warren-based cuniculture is somewhat more controlled, as the animals are generally kept to a specific area and a limited amount of supplemental feeding provided. Finally, various methods of raising rabbits with pasture as the primary food source have been developed. Pasturing rabbits within a fence (but not a cage) also known as colony husbandry, has not been commonly pursued due to the high death rate from weather and predators. More commonly (but still rare in terms of absolute numbers of rabbits and practitioners) is the practice of confining the rabbits to a moveable cage with an open or slatted floor so that the rabbits can access grass but still be kept at hand and protected from weather and predators. This method of growing rabbits does not typically result in an over-all reduction for the need for supplemented feed. The growing period to market weight is much longer for grass fed rather than pellet fed animals, and many producers continue to offer small amounts of complete rations {{over the course of the}} growing period. Hutches or cages for this type of husbandry are generally made of a combination of wood and metal wire, made portable enough for a person to move the rabbits daily to fresh ground, and of a size to hold a litter of 6 to 12 rabbits at the market weight of 4 to 5 pounds. Protection from sun and driving rain are important health concerns, as is durability against predator attacks and the ability to be cleaned to prevent loss from coccidious. Medical care and the use of medicated feed are less common.|$|R

Serum GH-BP was assayed using a previously described and validated charcoal-separation assay. 125 I-hGH binding to rat, ovine, bovine, rabbit, horse, dog and human sera was enhanced 1. 5 - 2. 5 -fold in the presence of 70 mM Mg 2 +. The Mg 2 + effect was concentration-dependent between 3. 7 mM and 70 mM, causing a significant and proportional increase in 125 I-hGH binding to serum. Like 125 I-hGH, 125 I-bPRL binding to type-III sera was also Mg(2 +) -dependent. In contrast, 125 I-bGH binding to all types of serum GH-BP was not affected by Mg 2 + concentrations of up to 35 mM, while 70 mM Mg 2 + slightly, but significantly, reduced (by approx. 15 %) bGH binding to <b>rabbit</b> serum. In <b>keeping</b> with the Mg(2 +) -dependent stimulation of lactogenic hormone binding to GH-BP, 70 mM Mg 2 + caused a shift to the left in the displacement curves of hGH and bPRL competing with 125 I-hGH binding to rabbit, dog, horse and human sera, while the effects of the somatogens bGH and rabbit GH were shifted to the right. Scatchard analysis of hGH displacement curves with sera from various species yielded linear plots and revealed that Mg 2 + significantly increased (2. 3 - 3. 0 -fold) the affinity constants, but not the binding capacities. These results demonstrate the ability of changes in Mg 2 + concentration to determine the degree of differential recognition of somatogens versus lactogens by serum GH-BP. It remains to be determined whether such bivalent cation effects may account, at least in part, for the growth retardation seen in Zn 2 + or Mg 2 + ion deficiencies...|$|R
40|$|The {{domestic}} rabbit is {{deprived of the}} protection of burrows and of a social hierarchy and live in a limited space which is {{a fraction of a}} metre of a hard sanitized space, removed from odours, markers and social interaction. Hot climate was the main cause for abnormal maternal and sexual behaviour. Exposure to high ambient temperature induces rabbits to try to balance their excessive heat load by using different means. The doe that was capable to produce 10 litters a year may give only 4 to 5 litters in hot climate Noise in rabitries causes adverse effects including nervous and behavioural abnormalities and can cause a startled response and traumatic injuries to limbs and back. Particularly, most concern about noise effects has traditionally focused on impairment of reproductive and maternal behaviours, although few controlled studies have been done to support the observations of animal caretakers that noise inhibits production. Moon phases are one of the main causes of abnormal sexual behaviour in females. Crowdness causes that rabbits become aggressive and bite one another during {{the first few days of}} nest sharing, while successive litters live together. <b>Keeping</b> <b>rabbits</b> singly in cages is not compatible with the demand of housing with respect to animal welfare, since the singly caged rabbit is exposed to natural external stimulus, has no social contact and has no conditions for suitable locomotion. This may be the reason in that caged rabbits show nervous behaviour and altered forms of movement and low relaxed resting-behaviour, that may be due to the narrowness of the cage and the wire floor. Social deprivation in rabbits interferes with the development of normal adult behaviours. However, among group-housed rabbits, survival at weaning was estimated to be 39 % instead of 87 % in individual cages. The behaviour and welfare of caged rabbit can be positively affected with repeated handling by familiar people. Minimal handling reduces timidity, particularly when performed during the first week of post-natal life. Higher growth rate and higher activity levels were recorded in rabbits handled daily for 10 minutes from 10 days to 10 weeks of age. Abuse and pushing the animals hard because of the method of production are cases in which the animals do not get optimal facilities necessary to fulfill their behavioural (ethological) needs...|$|R
40|$|The {{erythrocytes}} of {{some species}} are much damaged when handled in salt solutions, as in washing with the centrifuge after the ordinary method. The injury is mechanical in character. It may express itself in hemolysis {{only after the}} cells have been kept for some days. It is greatest {{in the case of}} dog corpuscles, and well marked with sheep and rabbit cells. The fragility of the red cells, as indicated by washing or shaking them in salt solution is different, not only for different species, but for different individuals. It varies independently of the resistance to hypotonic solutions. The protection of fragile erythrocytes during washing is essential {{if they are to be}} preserved in vitro for any considerable time. The addition of a little gelatin (⅛ per cent) to the wash fluid suffices for this purpose, and by its use the period of survival in salt solutions of washed rabbit, sheep, and dog cells is greatly prolonged. Plasma, like gelatin, has marked protective properties. Though gelatin acts as a protective for red cells it is not preservative of them in the real sense. Cells do not last longer when it is added to the fluids in which they are kept. Locke's solution, though better probably than Ringer's solution, or a sodium chloride solution, as a medium in which to keep red cells, is ultimately harmful. The addition of innocuous colloids does not improve it. But the sugars, especially dextrose and saccharose, have a remarkable power to prevent its injurious action, and they possess, in addition, preservative qualities. Cells washed in gelatin-Locke's and placed in a mixture of Locke's solution with an isotonic, watery solution of a sugar remain intact for a long time,—nearly 2 months in the case of sheep cells. The kept cells go easily into suspension free of clumps, they pass readily through paper filters, take up and give off oxygen, and when used for the Wassermann reaction behave exactly as do fresh cells of the same individual. The best preservative solutions are approximately isotonic with the blood serum. If the cells are to be much handled gelatin should be present, for the sugars do not protect against mechanical injury. Different preservative mixtures are required for the cells of different species. Dog cells last longest in fluids containing dextrin as well as a sugar. The mixture best for red cells is not necessarily best for leukocytes. A simple and practical method of <b>keeping</b> <b>rabbit</b> and human erythrocytes is in citrated whole blood to which sugar solution is added. In citrated blood, as such, human red cells tend to break down rather rapidly, no matter what the proportion of citrate. Hemolysis is well marked after little more than a week. But in a mixture of 3 parts of human blood, 2 parts of isotonic citrate solution (3. 8 per cent sodium citrate in water), and 5 parts of isotonic dextrose solution (5. 4 per cent dextrose in water), the cells remain intact for about 4 weeks. Rabbit red cells can be kept for more than 3 weeks in citrated blood; and the addition of sugar lengthens the preservation only a little. The results differ strikingly with the amount of citrate employed. Hemolysis occurs relatively early when the smallest quantity is used that will prevent clotting. The optimum mixture has 3 parts of rabbit blood to 2 of isotonic citrate solution. In the second part of this paper experiments are detailed which prove that cells preserved by the methods here recorded function excellently when reintroduced into the body...|$|R
40|$|One {{thing is}} {{as clear as}} water: the world needs to manage its water better, and waste less. Gloomy {{scenarios}} about water conflicts have drowned {{out a lot of}} positive initiatives, hopeful experiments and sound policy steps. Shortages have helped people and their governments learn how to cooperate and not compete: how to share, care and spare Too many people predict too often that scarcity of water, as with oil, will lead to violent conflicts and even inter-state wars. Small wonder since unlike oil, there is no alternative to water it is the basis of all life. Demand is expected to grow because of population growth, industrialisation, urbanisation and agricultural development, whether irrigated or not. By 2025, there will be more than 30 nations in the club of water scarce countries, compared with twenty or so today (on the basis of having less than 1000 m 3 of water available annually per person). This seems an awful lot to drink, wash and cook with, but it includes every drop of renewable freshwater used in all sectors. According to the same international standards, countries with around 1700 m 3 already suffer occasional and local water problems, and those with supplies below 500 m 3 experience absolute scarcity. Will there really be conflicts? The opening article in Spore 74 (April 1998) asked: Water: will there be conflicts? The answer, some three years later, is still uncertain, but it is likely to be: not necessarily. Despite previous rhetoric, the conviction has gained ground that solutions simply have to be found there is no way around it. Some have prophesised conflict but, according to Peter Ashton of the South African Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, this is based on the false assumption that communities and even governments have little or no choice in the matter, and that their only possible, logical reaction to water shortage is one based on violent competition. In fact there are other ways out; the best way to prevent and resolve conflicts is through participation of stakeholders, talking and debating as long as is needed. This goes for irrigators downstream on a canal, dependent on their colleagues upstream on the amount of water they let through. Similarly, it holds for different countries making use of one and the same river or underground water stocks. Africa, for instance, has nine major river basins the Congo, Lake Chad, Nile, Niger, Okovango, Orange, Senegal, Volta and Zambezi and numerous regional aquifers such as the sandstones of Nubia, and the Congo and Kalahari groundwater basins; they are all shared by numerous countries. It {{is not surprising that the}} areas facing the biggest tensions and thus the greatest need for dialogue are located in the regions that are verging between emerging water scarcity and absolute water scarcity (see Figure). Let s get Together And it is in these areas that dialogues are emerging, rather than water wars. Most countries in the Zambezi basin have drawn up development plans for hydropower, and increased water withdrawals for irrigation, industry and human consumption, but when added up they exceed the amount that can be withdrawn from the Zambezi. As a result, the Zambezi River Action Plan (ZACPLAN) was established in 1987 as the first comprehensive attempt to coordinate activities and establish an effective resources management plan for the basin. Although ZACPLAN is not legally binding on its nine signatories, its acceptance and functioning have become more promising with the ongoing processes of democratisation in Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and South Africa. In West Africa, the largest river system, the Niger basin, is the subject of a similar initiative known as the Niger Basin Authority (NBA) which was established in 1964 and is the oldest of its kind. Its nine members range from Guinea in the west to Chad in the east. Much of this Sahelian region has experienced persistent drought for several decades, resulting in dramatic ecological changes aggravated by intensified land use, desert encroachment and the depletion of Lake Chad. The NBA has been hampered by its member states lacking the means to participate fully, unable to implement legislation and to acquire the information technologies required for effective monitoring and database management. After a recent revamp, its new work plan is modestly supporting national efforts to improve water management on a local scale. In eastern Africa, both governmental and non-governmental initiatives have emerged around the Nile basin, with similar objectives as their fellow regions in the west and south (see Box 2). For the island states in the Pacific and Caribbean, water management is not so much an inter-statal issue, but more an internal one. The lower islands and atoll islands in particular depend largely on rainwater and shallow groundwater water resources. The expansion of any sector s water use will require better management to save fresh water, improved water harvesting techniques, desalinisation of seawater and recycling of wastewater. Some countries may be able to use tourist earnings to meet these costs. Peoples coping strategies Let us leave the national and intergovernmental level for now. After all, their citizens and communities have not been sitting idly. In situations of absolute water scarcity people have developed their own coping strategies. The Bushmen in Namibia find water in fruits, such as melons. Pastoralists in Sudan send out scouts to look for sources or simply follow the rains. When water is becoming scarce, the first thing that comes to mind is saving, storing and conserving water and alternative cultivation methods as featured regularly in Spore: rainwater harvesting in Kenya, fog collection in Cape Verde, increasing infiltration by constructing small, lunar-shaped ridges in West Africa, capturing seasonal discharges in small dams in Zimbabwe and using wastewater for irrigation. There is more to sound water management than simply saving it. Equal and careful read sustainable distribution and use of water requires the initiative and ongoing involvement of stakeholders. It is a permanent process since every solution, every innovation leads to a new challenge. If a community creates a small dam for watering cattle, the resulting unprecedented body of water makes the whole community brim with ideas. Brick making, fishponds, <b>keeping</b> <b>rabbits</b> or poultry or communally irrigated plots, to name but a few. This will require new rounds of consensus within the community and with others, upstream and downstream. It requires, too, an explicit say in it by women. They provide much of the labour in the fields, although they usually have neither land nor water rights. Although they participate in the management of small projects, they are usually outnumbered on committees and take a minimal role in decision making. The dialogue and consensus of which a village is capable has to go all the way upstream to provincial, national and even regional authorities. Even in areas of water scarcity, no village is an island. [caption to illustration] The locations of actual or potential water-related conflicts. [caption to illustration] Water pressures.
