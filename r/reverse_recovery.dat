25|$|Schottky diodes are {{constructed}} from a metal to semiconductor contact. They {{have a lower}} forward voltage drop than p–n junction diodes. Their forward voltage drop at forward currents of about 1mA is in the range 0.15V to 0.45V, which makes them useful in voltage clamping applications and prevention of transistor saturation. They {{can also be used}} as low loss rectifiers, although their reverse leakage current is in general higher than that of other diodes. Schottky diodes are majority carrier devices and so do not suffer from minority carrier storage problems that slow down many other diodes—so they have a faster <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> than p–n junction diodes. They also tend to have much lower junction capacitance than p–n diodes, which provides for high switching speeds and their use in high-speed circuitry and RF devices such as switched-mode power supply, mixers, and detectors.|$|E

2500|$|The {{effect can}} be {{significant}} when switching large currents very quickly. A certain amount of [...] "reverse recovery time" [...] tr (on the order of tens of nanoseconds to a few microseconds) {{may be required to}} remove the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> charge Qr from the diode.

Results obtained from experiments with insulated gate bipolar transistor showed a significant reduction in the time where current falls to zero when opposing current was injected into the device during its turn-off transient. Further simulation results from numerical modeling showed that the injected opposing current temporary increase recombination in the device and therefore reduce the extracted excess carriers that stored within the device.|$|E

5000|$|The most {{important}} {{difference between the}} p-n diode and the Schottky diode is the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time (trr), when the diode switches from the conducting to the non-conducting state. In a p-n diode, the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time {{can be in the}} order of several microseconds to less than 100 ns for fast diodes. Schottky diodes do not have a recovery time, as there is nothing to recover from (i.e., there is no charge carrier depletion region at the junction). The switching time is ~100 ps for the small-signal diodes, and up to tens of nanoseconds for special high-capacity power diodes. With p-n-junction switching, there is also a <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> current, which in high-power semiconductors brings increased EMI noise. With Schottky diodes, switching is essentially [...] "instantaneous" [...] with only a slight capacitive loading, which is much less of a concern.|$|E

50|$|Gold and {{platinum}} {{are used}} for minority carrier lifetime control. They are used in some infrared detection applications. Gold introduces a donor level 0.35 eV above the valence band and an acceptor level 0.54 eV below the conduction band. Platinum introduces a donor level also at 0.35 eV above the valence band, but its acceptor level is only 0.26 eV below conduction band; as the acceptor level in n-type silicon is shallower, the space charge generation rate is lower and therefore the leakage current is also lower than for gold doping. At high injection levels platinum performs better for lifetime reduction. <b>Reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> of bipolar devices is more dependent on the low-level lifetime, and its reduction is better performed by gold. Gold provides a good tradeoff between forward voltage drop and <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time for fast switching bipolar devices, where charge stored in base and collector regions must be minimized. Conversely, in many power transistors a long minority carrier lifetime is required to achieve good gain, and the gold/platinum impurities must be kept low.|$|E

Analysis of the forward current-voltage characteristics and <b>reverse</b> current <b>recovery</b> waveforms shows that the lifetimeτ of non-equilibrium carriers {{in the base of}} the diodes steadily increases with temperature across the entire temperature interval. The rise in τ and decrease in carrier mobilities and diffusion coefficients with increasing temperature nearly compensate each other as regards their effect on the differential resistance of the diode, Rd. As a result, Rd is virtually temperature independent. An appreciable modulation of the base resistance takes place at room temperature even at a relatively small current density j of 20 A/cm 2.

50|$|In summary, current {{injection}} technique {{makes it possible}} to use devices with low forward voltage drop for high frequency applications. This also imply cheaper cost of devices as less processing steps are required during the manufacturing stages where the need of carrier lifetime control techniques are reduced. This removed the need for the semiconductor device used in the current injection circuit to have high breakdown voltage rating and also provided electrical isolation. Typical application of this technique in an inductive load chopper circuit showed a significant reduction in the tail current of insulated gate bipolar transistors, and the <b>reverse</b> <b>recovery</b> time and charge of the freewheeling diode used.|$|E

These different physiological approaches to the osmo-respiratory compromise correlate with rapid, oppositely directed changes in gill morphology. In oscar, pavement cells (PVCs) expanded, partially covering neighboring mitochondria-rich cells (MRCs), which were recessed and reduced in size. Those remaining open were transformed from “shallow-basin” to “deep-hole” forms with smaller openings, deeper apical crypts, and smaller numbers of subapical microvesicles, changes that were largely <b>reversed</b> during normoxic <b>recovery.</b> In contrast, moderate hypoxia caused outward bulging of MRCs in rainbow trout with increases in size, surface exposure, and number of subapical microvesicles, accompanied by PVC retraction.
