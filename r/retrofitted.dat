40|$|This study {{examines}} energy efficiency <b>retrofit</b> depth in Ireland {{using data from}} a national residential grant scheme for energy efficiency upgrades. We specifically examine both the number of <b>retrofit</b> measures adopted per dwelling, and also the comprehensiveness of <b>retrofits</b> upgrades, which are <b>retrofits</b> {{in excess of the}} most common and simple <b>retrofit</b> combinations. We find that certain obligated parties, who are obliged by the State to reduce energy consumption in Ireland, vary both positively and negatively in terms of number of <b>retrofit</b> measures relative to private <b>retrofits,</b> but perform negatively with regard to comprehensive <b>retrofits.</b> All parties are found to perform negatively with regard to comprehensive <b>retrofits,</b> relative to private applications. Newer homes, relative to older homes are more likely to invest in more <b>retrofit</b> measures but less likely to engage in more comprehensive <b>retrofits.</b> Regionally, homes in the Greater Dublin Area are less likely to undertake more <b>retrofit</b> measures but {{more likely to engage in}} more comprehensive <b>retrofits,</b> while the opposite is true of rural areas. A seasonal trend also exists, with applications made during autumn and winter much less likely to be made for more comprehensive <b>retrofits.</b> Demand for more measures and more comprehensive <b>retrofits</b> does not appear to be affected by financial incentives as the introduction of a bonus for three- and four-measure <b>retrofits</b> has not coincided with any increases in the demand for such <b>retrofits...</b>|$|R

30|$|In the {{evaluation}} of the payback time, for each <b>retrofit</b> scenario, State incentives should be considered. Although the building is owned by the Municipality of Bologna, reference is made to the Italian State incentives delivered to private citizens, as recommended by the HERB consortium. The <b>retrofit</b> interventions are considered in the following sequence: thermal insulation of vertical and horizontal walls (<b>Retrofit</b> 1); <b>Retrofit</b> 1 [*]+[*]replacement of windows (<b>Retrofit</b> 2); <b>Retrofit</b> 2 [*]+[*]replacement of the heating and DHW plant (<b>Retrofit</b> 3); <b>Retrofit</b> 3 [*]+[*]LED lighting (<b>Retrofit</b> 4); <b>Retrofit</b> 4 [*]+[*]PV system (<b>Retrofit</b> 5). In this sequence, each additive cost receives a State contribution equal to 65  % of the cost. The LED lighting and the PV system receive this contribution because they are parts of a general <b>retrofit</b> plan which yields an annual use of primary energy lower than the limit prescribed by the Government for the applicability of the 65  % contribution. The State contribution is given in the form of tax reduction in 10 equal amounts, during a period of 10  years.

40|$|Many New Zealand {{studies have}} argued that house energy <b>retrofit</b> {{produces}} limited benefits, but {{the issue of how}} existing house retrofitting can lead to better energy performance and comfort improvement is little explored. The aim of this thesis was to examine the influence of house <b>retrofit</b> on energy efficiency and thermal comfort, using house model simulation and calculation. This study gives a holistic house <b>retrofit</b> approach in thermal comfort improvement and energy conservation. Three house <b>retrofit</b> categories were defined by household energy breakdown: Space Heating <b>Retrofit,</b> Hot Water System <b>Retrofit</b> and Appliances <b>Retrofit.</b> This study started with an investigation of New Zealand existing house stock. A typical house model was defined by the summarized common physical characteristics. This house model was used for <b>retrofit</b> testing. For the building space heating <b>retrofit</b> study, a series of thermal simulations was completed with different <b>retrofit</b> options. Thermal simulation results were compared both in thermal comfort and space heating energy requirement. It was discovered that the optimum level full insulation <b>retrofit</b> significantly reduced space heating energy requirement and also improved thermal comfort. <b>Retrofit</b> solutions for water heating, lighting and appliances were compared by cost and energy saving. Cost effectiveness cross comparison for all of the <b>retrofit</b> solutions was carried out. Retrofitting for space heating system and hot water system can be considered for long term cost effectiveness. Appliances and lighting <b>retrofit</b> have a higher efficacy than other <b>retrofit</b> options in terms of energy saving and cost benefit cycle. These findings are used to provide suggestions for retrofitting of existing houses...|$|R
40|$|Heat Pinch Analysis <b>retrofit</b> {{projects}} are typically performed by evaluating and maximising the heat recovery potentials within the individual process units. Once the potential improvements {{from the individual}} units have been assessed, the Total Site (TS) Heat Integration analysis is performed. Such approach may steer designers away from the promising <b>retrofit</b> opportunities and to lead towards suboptimal heat exchanger networks (HEN). This paper presents an effective <b>retrofit</b> framework for a TS system to determine the most cost-effective <b>retrofit</b> options and maximise the potential savings. Instead of performing the typical unit-wise process <b>retrofit,</b> the strategy {{is to determine the}} baseline total site consumption and benchmark targets, and to identify <b>retrofit</b> options from the TS context. This TS <b>retrofit</b> framework has been tested on a case study involving a petrochemical plant comprising of multiple process sections. The results of the analysis show that significant energy savings can be realised when both direct and indirect heat recovery <b>retrofit</b> options are evaluated. Further energy savings can be achieved via the Plus-Minus Principle that helps pinpoint the correct locations of heat surpluses and deficits and lead to the appropriate TS <b>retrofit</b> solution.

40|$|Executive Summary Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) is furthering {{residential}} energy <b>retrofit</b> {{research in}} the mixed-humid climate of East Tennessee by selecting 10 homes and guiding the homeowners in the energy <b>retrofit</b> process. The homeowners pay for the <b>retrofits,</b> and ORNL advises which <b>retrofits</b> to complete and collects post-retrofit data. This effort is {{in accordance with the}} Department of Energy s Building America program research goal of demonstrating market-ready energy <b>retrofit</b> packages that reduce home energy use by 30 50 %. Through this research, ORNL researchers hope to understand why homeowners decide to partake in energy <b>retrofits,</b> the payback of home energy <b>retrofits,</b> and which <b>retrofit</b> packages most economically reduce energy use. Homeowner interviews help the researchers understand the homeowners experience. Information gathered during the interviews will aid in extending market penetration of home energy <b>retrofits</b> by helping researchers and the <b>retrofit</b> industry understand what drives homeowners in making positive decisions regarding these <b>retrofits.</b> This report summarizes the selection process, the pre-retrofit condition, the recommended <b>retrofits,</b> the actual cost of the <b>retrofits</b> (when available), and an estimated energy savings of the <b>retrofit</b> package using EnergyGauge. Of the 10 households selected to participate in the study, only five completed the recommended <b>retrofits,</b> three completed at least one but no more than three of the recommended <b>retrofits,</b> and two households did not complete any of the recommended <b>retrofits.</b> In the case of the two homes that did none of the recommended work, the pre-retrofit condition of the homes and the recommended <b>retrofits</b> are reported. The five homes that completed the recommended <b>retrofits</b> are monitored for energy consumption of the whole house, appliances, space conditioning equipment, water heater, and most of the other circuits with miscellaneous electric loads (MELs) and lighting. Thermal comfort is also monitored, with temperature and humidity measured in all conditioned zones, attics, crawlspaces, and unconditioned basements. In some homes, heat flux transducers are installed on the basement walls to help determine the insulating qualities of the technologies and practices. EnergyGauge is used to estimate the pre-retrofit and post-retrofit home energy rating system (HERS) index and reduction in energy consumption and energy bill. In a follow-up report, data from the installed sensors will be presented and analyzed as well as a comparison of the post-retrofit energy consumption of the home to the EnergyGauge model of the post-retrofit home. Table ES 1 shows the <b>retrofits</b> that were completed at the eight households where {{some or all of the}} recommended <b>retrofits</b> were completed. Home aliases are used to keep the homeowners anonymous. Some key findings of this study thus far are listed as follows. Some homeowners (50 %) are not willing to spend the money to reach 30 50 % energy savings. Quality of <b>retrofit</b> work is significantly variable among contractors which impact the potential energy savings of the <b>retrofit.</b> Challenges exist in defining house volume and floor area.

40|$|A {{summary of}} the current {{research}} towards the development and validation of a counter-intuitive seismic <b>retrofit</b> strategy for non-ductile reinforced concrete (RC) frames, termed as selective weakening (SW) <b>retrofit,</b> is herein presented. The SW <b>retrofit</b> is conceived with the aim for wide-implementation, economical, and noninvasive structural <b>retrofit</b> solution for non-ductile (pre- 1970 s) RC frame structures. Contrary to the misconception that seismic <b>retrofit</b> must involved strengthening (force-based approach) SW <b>retrofit</b> relies upon targeted weakening of structural elements {{in order to achieve}} a ductile failure mechanism, thus explicitly enforcing capacity design philosophy within a displacement-based <b>retrofit</b> strategy. In this research, the SW <b>retrofit</b> is implemented to RC frames and more specifically to exterior beam-column (b-c) joints. The bottom longitudinal reinforcements of the beam are cut at the interface with the column and/or external horizontal pre-stressing is applied to the joint. A more desirable inelastic mechanism can be attained within the b-c connection, leading to improved global seismic performance for the RC frame. Experimental validations of the SW <b>retrofit</b> solution of exterior b-c joints are summarized to complement the conceptual development of the SW <b>retrofit.</b> Insights from quasi-static tests on nine 2 / 3 -scaled exterior b-c joint sub-assemblies (with and without <b>retrofit)</b> are discussed in respect to different retrofitting and as-built parameters. Lastly, a simple hand-calculation <b>retrofit</b> design procedure for a SW <b>retrofit</b> on b-c joints is presented. The results demonstrate the viability of such a simple but structurally efficient seismic rehabilitation strategy...|$|R
40|$|CMAS is an {{intensive}} user of electricity for lighting {{because of its}} size, lack of daylight, and 24 -hour operating schedule. Argonne National Laboratory recently conducted a lighting energy conservation evaluation at CMAS. The evaluation included inspection and characterization of existing lighting systems, analysis of energy-efficient <b>retrofit</b> options, and investigation of the environmental effects that these lighting system <b>retrofits</b> could have when {{they are ready to}} be disposed of as waste. Argonne devised three <b>retrofit</b> options for the existing lighting systems at various buildings: (1) minimal <b>retrofit</b> [...] limited fixture replacement; (2) moderate <b>retrofit</b> [...] more extensive fixture replacement and limited application of motion detectors; and (3) advanced <b>retrofit</b> [...] fixture replacement, {{reduction in the number of}} lamps, expansion of task lighting, and more extensive application of motion detectors. Argonne used data on electricity consumption to analyze the economic and energy effects of these three <b>retrofit</b> options. It performed a cost analysis for each <b>retrofit</b> option in terms of payback. The analysis showed that lighting <b>retrofits</b> result in savings because they reduce electricity consumption, cooling load, and maintenance costs. The payback period for all <b>retrofit</b> options was found to be less than 2 years, with the payback period decreasing for more aggressive <b>retrofits.</b> These short payback periods derived largely from the intensive (24 -hours-per-day) use of electric lighting at the facility. Maintenance savings accounted for more than half of the annual energy-related savings under the minimal and moderate <b>retrofit</b> options and slightly less than half of these savings under the advanced <b>retrofit</b> option. Even if maintenance savings were excluded, the payback periods would still be impressive: about 4. 4 years for the minimal <b>retrofit</b> option and 2 years for the advanced option. The local and regional environmental impacts of the three <b>retrofit</b> options were minimal...|$|R
