40|$|We {{demonstrate}} a computational network model that integrates 18 in vitro, high-throughput screening assays measuring estrogen receptor (ER) binding, dimerization, chromatin binding, transcriptional activation and ER-dependent cell proliferation. The network model uses activity patterns across the in vitro assays to predict whether a chemical is an ER agonist or antagonist, or is otherwise influencing the assays through a manner {{dependent on the}} physics and chemistry of the technology platform (“assay interference”). The method is applied to a library of 1812 commercial and environmental chemicals, including 45 ER positive and negative <b>reference</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Among the <b>reference</b> <b>chemicals,</b> the network model correctly identified the agonists and antagonists {{with the exception of}} very weak compounds whose activity was outside the concentration range tested.

This dataset and model were also used to begin a systematic investigation of assay interference. The most prominent cause of false-positive activity (activity in an assay that is likely not due to interaction of the chemical with ER) is cytotoxicity.

Predicting physiologically-relevant activity with HTS data requires estimating the response {{of a large number}} of chemicals across a battery of screening assays based on sparse dose-response data for each chemical-assay combination. Many standard dose-response methods are inadequate because they treat each curve separately and under-perform when there are as few as six to ten observations per curve.
