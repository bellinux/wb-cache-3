30|$|We {{continue}} to query the left (right) parallel {{line of the}} <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is, and search the parent node of the found right (left) parallel line. If the right parallel line is the left child, and the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the query object is does not have left adjacent parallel line, then the neighbor region of the queried data object is the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is and the right parallel line. If the right parallel line is the right child, and the parent node parallel line is the left parallel line of the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is, then the neighbor region of the queried data object is the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is and {{the left and right}} parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the left child, and the parent node parallel line is the right parallel line of the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is, then the neighbor region of the queried data object is the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is and the left and right parallel lines. If the left parallel line is the right child, we use the middle order traversal algorithm to search for the direct stepfather node of the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is, and the parallel line of the direct stepfather node is the right parallel line of the <b>region</b> <b>where</b> the queried object is. We calculate the distance between the data objects in the above searched region and the queried object, sorting and inserting these data objects into the sorting queue.|$|R

5|$|After the 1998 {{death of}} Ruby, the zoo's famous {{painting}} elephant, the zoo abandoned its elephant breeding program {{and began to}} focus on elephant behavior. The zoo is currently home to three Asian elephants that have a variety of behavioral issues, the most common being aggression toward other elephants. One elephant is a former performer at a circus and was subject to mistreatment, while the other two were captured in remote <b>regions</b> <b>where</b> they were never properly socialized.|$|E

5|$|Because Neptune {{is not a}} solid body, its {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The wide {{equatorial zone}} rotates with {{a period of about}} 18hours, which is slower than the 16.1-hour rotation of the planet's magnetic field. By contrast, the reverse is true for the polar <b>regions</b> <b>where</b> the rotation period is 12hours. This differential rotation is the most pronounced of any planet in the Solar System, and it results in strong latitudinal wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Blank pistol {{cartridges}} carrying CS in {{powder form}} have been released to the public.

5|$|Cacti {{have many}} other uses. They {{are used for}} human food and as fodder for animals, usually after burning off their spines.

5|$|Cowpeas {{thrive in}} poor dry conditions, growing well in soils up to 85% sand. This makes them a {{particularly}} important crop in arid, semi-desert <b>regions</b> <b>where</b> not many other crops will grow. As {{well as an}} important source of food for humans in poor arid regions the crop can also be used as feed for livestock. Its nitrogen fixing ability means that as well as functioning as a sole-crop, the cowpea can be effectively intercropped with sorghum, millet, maize, cassava or cotton.|$|E
5|$|Dense {{vegetation}} (such as that {{of tropical}} rainforests) and urban habitats are not ideal {{for the establishment of}} the human transmission cycle. However, in <b>regions</b> <b>where</b> the sylvatic habitat and its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.|$|E
