40|$|Updated {{information}} on cultivated land {{is important for}} Chinese central and local governments. The data can be acquired using aerial photographs and Thematic Mapper (TM) images. But an exhaustive annual survey covering all of China's territory by these remote sensing images is too expensive, therefore a sampling technique has to be employed. Spatial sampling takes the spatial distribution characteristics of the object to be monitored into account. We propose both direct and indirect spatial sampling models for monitoring spatially discrete distributed objects. For the indirect method, each sampling domain is equal to a specified region but is not directly linked with the reporting unit, consequently, the <b>report</b> <b>unit</b> estimates may have few or perhaps even no samples within the report units. Therefore the indirect sampling model can provide sampling estimates for {{a large number of}} report units with a limited number of sample units and a limited sampling budget. The zoning of the monitored object is based on prior knowledge about the controlling factors and the spatial homogeneity of the variable. The method is used to develop a sampling solution for monitoring cultivated land dynamics. The models were tested in Shandon province and Zhaozhuang county...|$|E

40|$|In many {{household}} surveys, geographically clustered households <b>report</b> <b>unit</b> {{values of}} foods, which when corrected for quality effects and for measurement error, indicate the underlying spatial variation in prices, {{and can be}} matched to variation in demand patterns so as to estimate price elasticities. A 1979 household survey from the Cote d'Ivoire is used to estimate price elasticities for beef, meat, fish, cereals, and starches. In the United States, {{as well as in}} many Western European countries, income taxes are a major source of government revenue, and it is appropriate that economists should have devoted a great deal of both theoretical and empirical effort to calculating the effects of income taxes on labor supply and on government revenue. By contrast, few devel-oping countries possess the administrative machinery that would permit a comprehen-sive income tax or Social Security system, so that correspondingly greater emphasis is placed upon indirect taxation and subsidies. In such circumstances, intelligent policy de-sign requires knowledge of price elasticities for taxable commodities. Such knowledge would normally be obtained by the analysis of time-series data on aggregate demands, prices, and incomes. Unfortunately, few de-veloping countries have time-series of a length that is adequate to estimate even own-price elasticities, let alone the cross-price elasticities that are also required. However, many developing countries regularly collect high-quality household survey data on ex-penditures and quantities {{of a wide range of}} commodities. To my knowledge, such data currently exist for such diverse LDC's a...|$|E
40|$|Much {{attention}} has been given to sampling design, and the sampling method chosen directly affects the sampling accuracy. The development of spatial sampling theory has lead to the recognition of the importance of taking spatial dependency into account when sampling. This text uses the new Sandwich Spatial Sampling and Inference (SSSI) software as a tool to compare the relative error, coefficient of variation (CV), and design effect with five sampling models – simple random sampling, stratified sampling, spatial random sampling, spatial stratified sampling, and sandwich spatial sampling. The five models are simulated 1000 times each with a range of sample sizes from 10 to 80. SSSI includes six models in all, but systematic sampling is not used here because the sample positions are fixed. The dataset consists of 84 points measuring soil heavy metal content in Shanxi Province, China. The whole area is stratified into four layers by soil type、hierarchical cluster and geochronology, and three layers by geological surface. The research shows that the accuracy of spatial simple random sampling and spatial stratified sampling is better than simple random sampling and stratified sampling because the soil content is spatially continuous, and stratified models are more efficient than non-stratified models. Stratification by soil type yields higher accuracy than by geochronology in the case of smaller sample sizes, but lower accuracy in larger sample sizes. Based on spatial stratified sampling, sandwich sampling develops a report layer composed of the user’s final report units, allowing the user to obtain the mean and variance of each <b>report</b> <b>unit</b> with high accuracy. In the case of soil sampling, SSSI was a useful tool for evaluating the accuracy of different sampling techniques. 1...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M Social Work (Social Work)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. The {{welfare of}} {{communities}} depends {{to a large}} extent on the successful mobilisation of the voluntary contributions (manpower, time, money) by religious based organisations. Poverty and all the other social problems like unemployment and HIV/AIDS, that are associated with it, can only be addressed effectively if volunteers are empowered by social workers to handle the problems in a sustaining way (Annual <b>report,</b> <b>Unit</b> for Religion Development Research: 2002). In order to empower the volunteers, it is important that social workers understand their role in the empowerment process. The aim of the study is to clarify the task of the social worker regarding the empowerment of volunteers at religious based organisations. This study is a descriptive study, seeing that the empowerment of volunteers are described {{at the end of the}} research (Mouton, 2001 : 54). The study also contains elements of an exploring (investigation) study, seeing that the situation has been explored in practice. After completion of a literate study, an empirical investigation was done with the aim to investigate principles of empowerment in practice. For the purpose of this study, the universe is regarded as the social workers who work at religious based organisations in the working area of the Valcare Trust. Deliberate selection, according to the non-probability test sampling as described by Babbie and Mouton (2001 : 166 - 168) was used to obtain the test sample. The type of test sample selection is applicable where the researcher is conversant with the research problem and the universe (Rubin and Babbie, 1993). Deliberate selection is therefore based on the researcher’s judgement and the aim of the study (Rubin and Babbie, 1993). The researcher is well conversant with the universe, seeing that the social workers are working at religious based organisations that are registered on the database of the Valcare Trust. Questionnaires, consisting of structured questions were compiled after completion of the literate study for the purpose of the empirical study. The self administered questionnaires were supplied to the respondents. Thirteen respondents took part in the empirical study...|$|E

40|$|Spatial {{sampling}} {{is widely}} used in environmental and social research. In this paper we consider the situation where instead of a single global estimate of the mean of an attribute for an area, estimates are required for each of many geographically defined <b>reporting</b> <b>units</b> (such as counties or grid cells) because their means cannot be assumed {{to be the same}} as the global figure. Not only may survey costs greatly increase if sample size has to be a function of the number of <b>reporting</b> <b>units,</b> estimator sampling error tends to be large if the population attribute of each <b>reporting</b> <b>unit</b> can be estimated by using only those samples actually lying inside the unit itself. This study proposes a computationally simple approach to multi-unit reporting by using analysis of variance and incorporating 'twice-stratified' statistics. We assume that, although the area is heterogeneous (the mean varies across the area), it can be zoned (or stratified) into homogeneous subareas (the mean is constant within each subarea) and, in addition, {{that it is possible to}} acquire prior knowledge about this partition. This zoning of the study area is independent of the <b>reporting</b> <b>units.</b> The zone estimates are transferred to the <b>reporting</b> <b>units.</b> We call the methodology sandwich estimation and we report two contrasting empirical studies to demonstrate the application of the methodology and to compare its performance against some other existing methods for tackling this problem. Our study shows that sandwich estimation performs well against two other frequently used, probabilistic, model-based approaches to multi-unit reporting on stratified heterogeneous surfaces whilst having the advantage of computational simplicity. We suggest those situations where sandwich estimation might be expected to do well...|$|R
