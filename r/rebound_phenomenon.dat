500|$|Damage to the {{cerebellum}} often causes motor-related symptoms, {{the details}} of which depend {{on the part of}} the cerebellum involved and how it is damaged. Damage to the [...] flocculonodular lobe may show up as a loss of equilibrium and in particular an altered, irregular walking gait, with a wide stance caused by difficulty in balancing. Damage to the lateral zone typically causes problems in skilled voluntary and planned movements which can cause errors in the force, direction, speed and amplitude of movements. Other manifestations include hypotonia (decreased muscle tone), dysarthria (problems with speech articulation), dysmetria (problems judging distances or ranges of movement), dysdiadochokinesia (inability to perform rapid alternating movements such as walking), impaired check reflex or <b>rebound</b> <b>phenomenon,</b> and intention tremor (involuntary movement caused by alternating contractions of opposing muscle groups). Damage to the midline portion may disrupt whole-body movements, whereas damage localized more laterally is more likely to disrupt fine movements of the hands or limbs. Damage to the upper part of the cerebellum tends to cause gait impairments and other problems with leg coordination; damage to the lower part is more likely to cause uncoordinated or poorly aimed movements of the arms and hands, as well as difficulties in speed. This complex of motor symptoms is called ataxia.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the rebound {{vibration}} characteristics of a SLR camera 2 ̆ 7 s internal mirror model. The mechanism of the mirror <b>rebound</b> <b>phenomena</b> is considered by using six types of rectangle metal plate models. In the experiment, the behavior of vibration during the <b>rebound</b> <b>phenomena</b> is observed. The mirror models are supported with rotational axis at long axis of the model. The mirror models swing down freely from the horizontal plane and then hit with a stopper. Amount of rebound is measured by a laser displacement meter. The {{results indicate that the}} rebound amount depends on the stopper position. The vibration behavior after the collision varies by stopper position. The vibration after the collision depends on the deformation while in contact with the stopper at the time of collision. We observed that when the amount of rebound is small, there is a tendency that the vibration after the collision becomes large. © 2013 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers...|$|R

40|$|Introduction It is {{well know}} {{that changes in}} {{spontaneous}} brain rhythms accompany both sensory stimulation and motor activity in humans and that such changes arise from sensorimotor areas of the cortex[1 - 3]. In particular, sensory input has been observed to suppress activity in both centrally distributed alpha or mu (8 - 15 Hz) and beta (15 - 25 Hz) frequency bands and {{there is evidence that}} there is a rebound of this activity following electrical stimulation of the digits [1]. Furthermore, such <b>rebound</b> <b>phenomena</b> appear to arise from the hand area of the postcentral gyrus and can be influenced by ongoing motor activity or even motor imagery [1, 4]. In the current study, we apply a new method, synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) [5, 6] to localize frequency specific changes in sensorimotor cortex during passive tactile stimulation.

50|$|<b>Rebound</b> <b>phenomena</b> do not {{necessarily}} only occur on discontinuation of a prescribed dosage. For example, daytime rebound effects of anxiety, metallic taste, perceptual disturbances which are typical benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms can occur the next day after a short acting benzodiazepine hypnotic wears off. Another example is early morning rebound insomnia which may occur when a rapidly eliminated hypnotic wears off which leads to rebounding awakeness forcing the person to become wide awake before {{he or she has}} had a full night's sleep. One drug which seems to be commonly associated with these problems is triazolam due to its high potency and ultra short half life but these effects can occur with other short acting hypnotic drugs. Quazepam due to its selectivity for type1 benzodiazepine receptors and long half life does not cause daytime anxiety rebound effects during treatment, showing that half life is very important for determining whether a nighttime hypnotic will cause next day rebound withdrawal effects or not. Daytime rebound effects are {{not necessarily}} mild but can sometimes produce quite marked psychiatric and psychological disturbances.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFroth {{flotation}} is {{a process}} that utilizes the surface properties of mineral particles to separate them from unwanted gangue materials. Usually, the mineral particles are either naturally hydrophobic, or surfactant-treated hydrophobic and thus, they are prone to adhere to bubbles. Once attached, the capillary force is dominant in the control of the particle bubble aggregate stability. Capillary force is a function of surface tension and contact angle, which is a measure of particle hydrophobicity. In this paper, the Discrete Element Method has been applied to simulate the interaction between particles and a central bubble in a quiescent liquid with the aim of describing: (1) the motion of the particle sliding over the bubble surface, and (2) the formation of the three phase contact line. Simulation results for particle-bubble separation distance versus time showed excellent agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, the simulations correctly predicted the time when the particle contacted the bubble. Additional simulations were carried out for multi-particle attachment that highlighted the interaction between particles, including collision and <b>rebounding</b> <b>phenomena.</b> These simulations correctly captured experimental observations reported in the literature and have provided valuable insight into the particle loading capacity of bubbles being utilized in mineral flotation devices...|$|R

During the plasma-exchange period, patients remained on the drug regimen they were on at admission to the hospital. Plasma was replaced isovolemically with human, purified plasma protein fraction. Improvement in clinical parameters of synovitis and serological parameters of inflammation occurred in almost all patients. After 6 months the clinical remissions were sustained.

The <b>rebound</b> <b>phenomena</b> were moderate and of short duration. Plasma-exchange may exert its beneficial effects by depleting important mediators of injury such a complement fibrinogen and circulating immune complexes, by improving reticuloendothelial function, and by increasing the drug response of the inflammatory target tissue.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} prob-lems during cardiac surgery is the prevention and treatment of hyper-tension, occurring in 40 - 60 % of the patients following coronary artery bypass surgery (CABS). Hyperten-sion should be avoided to prevent myocardial damage, neurologic com-plications, increased blood loss, and premature graft closure due to inti-mal damage. During and following cardiac surgery hypertension is rou-tinely treated with vasodilating agents, which generally induce reflex tachycardia and increased intrapul-monary shunting. The results obtained with ketan-serin, a specific S 2 -serotonergic re-ceptor blocker with alpha 1 -adrener-gic receptor blocking properties, in the prevention and treatment of hy-pertension in patients undergoing cardiac surgery, are presented.

30|$|The {{relatively}} {{large number of}} drug holidays reported in this study, with a dosing interruption of 3 or more days, are of considerable concern. The rapid discontinuation of a psychotropic drug may trigger immediate withdrawal symptoms or delayed <b>rebound</b> <b>phenomena,</b> related to complex factors including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a drug formulation, and individual metabolism (Baldessarini et al. 1999; Cerovecki et al. 2013; Franks et al. 2008; Fava et al. 2015; Correll 2010; Osterberg et al. 2010). After a drug holiday, patients often resume taking the full-strength dosage, including of drugs that are slowly titrated upward. Re-starting a drug after a long lapse may trigger first-dose effects (Urquhart 1998). Given the frequent use of polypharmacy, drug holidays may impact the potential for drug interactions (Spina et al. 2016).
