40|$|Electro-Mechanical {{devices such}} as Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are {{potentially}} an important technology for the generation of <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy.</b> These underwater Acoustic Emitting (AE) machines are liable to experience certain failure modes such as damaged bearings, hydraulic faults, electrical arcs, vibration, etc. during their operation. This can lead to catastrophic failure of components of an overall ocean based system if necessary preventative measures are not taken. It is important therefore to create a robust condition monitoring process of rapid detection and classification of faults in these machines, to reduce costs and increase lifetime and reliability. This will assist companies involved in the deployment of these systems, particularly companies involved in the <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> and marine technology sectors, to improve on the operational and management costs of ocean based systems, specifically impacting on efficiency and yield, reliability, and maintenance costs. Underwater sound around AE machines and vessels is often monitored for environmental impact assessment studies, and {{could be used to}} monitor the health of AE machines and vessels. This thesis illustrates the acquisition and visualization of acoustic signals produced by underwater AE machinery/vessels. It illustrates the technique involved in the deployment of an acquisition system and the subsequent conditioning, processing and presentation of the acquired underwater acoustic data. The work presented in this thesis also involves numerical modelling and simulation of low frequency component sound signals of underwater AE machines and vessels.

40|$|The Deepwater Horizon {{oil spill}} of 2010 brought a renewed focus on finding the least {{environmentally}} harmful and most cost-effective solutions to our society’s energy needs. Seventy-one {{percent of the}} Earth’s surface is covered by its oceans. In the last century, much attention {{has been focused on}} submarine hydrocarbon deposits, such as the extensive natural gas and oil reserves situated under the outer continental shelf (OCS). “The OCS is a significant source of oil and gas for the Nation’s energy supply,” with leases for 43 million acres of the OCS providing 15 percent of America’s domestic natural gas production and 27 percent of America’s domestic oil production. Oil and natural gas are not the only energy resources held by our oceans; the Earth’s oceans contain vast stores of energy, much of which can be harnessed to create usable power in the form of electricity. Beyond these hydrocarbon mineral resources, the ocean offers great potential for the extraction of renewable energy. Analyses of the renewable energy generation potential of the oceans suggest harnessable energy far in excess of global electricity demands. Moreover, it is estimated {{that more than half of}} the population of the United States lives near or on the coast. This fact of geography and demography points to the great potential for using ocean energy resources to provide useful power to society. As the United States moves toward an increased reliance on lower-carbon fuels and the production of renewable energy, demand for <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> resources is growing. These resources include the generation of electricity from offshore wind, tides, currents and waves, as well as capturing usable power from ocean thermal energy gradients. This Article provides a unique overview of the opportunities for the production of usable power from ocean energy resources other than oil and gas, as well as the legal regimes applicable to, and policy questions relating to that production. Part I covers the diverse array of technologies available for the extraction of energy from ocean resources, and illustrates selected examples of ocean energy projects in operation or under development. Part II addresses the patchwork of legal regimes governing ocean energy development in United States waters. Part III summarizes key tools and incentives that states and the federal government can and do employ to further ocean energy development. Part IV focuses on the question of whether ocean renewable power can be cost-competitive, using case studies to analyze that question. Part V covers policy questions that must be answered as society moves forward to tap the ocean’s energy resources. In summary, this Article offers a comprehensive characterization of the oceans’ potential to produce renewable power, as well as an analysis of how the current fragmented regulatory framework may be hampering development of these resources’ full potential. It offers recommendations for consolidating regulatory review of <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> projects to reduce regulatory risk and enable <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> to become more a cost-competitive component of the nation’s energy resources...|$|E

With a vast array of potential extraction possibilities including wave energy, tidal <b>energy</b> and <b>ocean</b> current <b>energy,</b> the evolvement of the technologies has not seen the same growth as other renewable energy sectors such as wind and solar.

40|$|Several African {{countries}} in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) endure insufficiencies in the power sector, including both generation and distribution. One important step towards increasing energy security and availability is to intensify the use of renewable energy sources. The access to cost-efficient hydropower is low in coastal and island regions and combinations of different renewable energy sources will play an increasingly important role. In this study the physical preconditions for <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> are investigated, considering the specific context of the WIO countries. Global-level resource assessments and oceanographic literature and data have been compiled {{in an analysis of}} the match between technology-specific requirements for ocean energy technologies (wave power, ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC), tidal barrages, tidal current turbines, and ocean current power) and the physical resources in 13 WIO regions Kenya, Seychelles, Northern Tanzania and Zanzibar, Southern Tanzania, Comoros and Mayotte, Northern-, Central-, and Southern Mozambique, Western-, Eastern-, and Southern Madagascar, Reunion, and Mauritius. The results show high potential for wave power over vast coastal stretches in southern parts of the WIO and high potential for OTEC at specific locations in Mozambique, Comoros, Reunion, and Mauritius. The potential for tidal power and ocean current power is more restricted but may be of interest at some locations.

40|$|The {{state of}} Oregon is {{developing}} a comprehensive plan to guide the potential siting of <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy</b> projects in Oregon’s Territorial Sea. To this end, the state is revising its Territorial Sea Plan (TSP), and has begun collecting information on the spatial extent of human uses that provide economic and socio-cultural benefits. One data gap identified was the distribution and spatial extent of commercial, charter, and recreational fisheries. Ecotrust and others engaged in collecting relevant information on these use activities. In the near term, the resulting data set forms the basis for siting decisions for energy projects that minimize impacts to the marine ecosystem and existing human uses. Longer term, these data are also useful for other marine spatial planning processes and form a baseline for subsequent monitoring and evaluation research of management measures. Our research team developed and deployed an interactive, custom computer interview instrument, Open OceanMap, to collect geo-referenced information from commercial, charter, and recreational fishermen about the extent and relative importance of Oregon marine waters. Data collection occurred in two stages: March-May 2009 and December 2009 –September 2010. We compiled these data in a geographic information system (GIS) that we delivered to the Oregon Department of Land Conservation and Development (DLCD).

40|$|New {{technologies}} for {{the extraction of}} valuable ocean resources are emerging: <b>renewable</b> <b>ocean</b> <b>energy.</b> Ocean energy technologies have so far primarily been developed in industrialized countries but will be deployed in both industrialized and developing countries. Ocean energy technologies promise benefits to people and the global environment on the one hand, and carry risks to marine ecosystems on the other. Simultaneously, the world’s oceans are under severe pressure from human activities, mainly due to a history of high technical development in combination with low regulation. Much could be gained by proactively examining both benefits and hazards at early stages of development. In this thesis, the Technology Assessment framework {{has been used to}} outline prerequisites for, benefits from, and adverse consequences of ocean energy technologies in developing countries. The case-study is the Western Indian Ocean (eastern Africa), a region experiencing increasing energy demand, both in fossil fuel-dependent small islands and in mainland countries with very low rural electrification levels and diesel-fuelled off-grid systems. This thesis combines technical, social, and environmental aspects. Firstly, resource overviews were performed, indicating that potentially useful ocean energy sources exist in the region. Wave power resources are abundant in southern parts of the case-study region and conditions are good for ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC) at several locations. Secondly, the socio-technical prerequisites for the use of ocean energy technologies were examined, considering both small-scale (off-grid) and large-scale (main-grid) applications. Numerous barriers to small-scale use were identified; these should be addressed both by adapting technology and by improving institutional quality. Thirdly, the benefits of different ocean energy technologies were discussed based on the regional context of local demand and existing power systems. In rural areas, electricity demand is low and introduced power sources for off-grid electrification need to be used for productive purposes and should be accompanied by other rural development services, if economic development is to be improved. Connected to main-grids, ocean energy can provide significant amounts of fuel-independent electricity, of particular value to the small island states. Finally, environmental consequences were examined, concluding that very little is yet known. The outcomes of this thesis indicate that large-scale developments of wave power and OTEC can become important contributors to small island states in the Western Indian Ocean, while implementation of small-scale ocean energy in the region would encounter many socio-technical challenges. Due to its higher robustness, higher power output, and by-product of desalinated water, OTEC may provide the highest benefits of the two. In both cases, uncertainties regarding ecological risks remain important constraints to thorough assessment. Mitigation of ecological risks requires more research, emphasis on key ecological processes and cumulative effects in risk assessments, and efficient monitoring of impacts. At the resource-level, risks can be reduced by having a wide range of technical options to choose from (many different {{technologies for}} extracting the same resource), and by using technologies that can be further adapted, even after they have become widely used. From this perspective, wave power is the more promising ocean energy technology for the region. The thesis provides a first step towards a policy-supporting proactive Technology Assessment of ocean energy in a developing country context...|$|E

In this scenario, expectations are particularly high for offshore wind, <b>ocean</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy,</b> blue biotechnology and marine aquatic products. Within several of these domains, Europe is in a leading position when it comes to technology and innovation: it has generated around half of the reviewed patents in offshore wind and some 25  % of the reviewed patents in <b>ocean</b> <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> sources. A strong performance can also be recorded in sustainable innovations for marine aquatic products. Furthermore, Europe is well placed to lead not only in the transformation of traditional maritime economic activities, e.g. green shipping, sustainable tourism, sustainable aquaculture, but also promoting more sustainable forms of business within oil and gas or marine mineral mining.

Scientific research indicates that greenhouse gas emissions, mainly induced by using non-renewable energy, are elevating temperatures and sea levels for coastal cities all around the world. Other issues that aggravate the challenge for coastal cities include: the continued growth of population on and around coastlines; the acute conflict between increasing energy demand and decreasing amount of natural energy resource. All evidences lead to one fundamental element for coastal eco cities: utilizing <b>renewable</b> <b>energy</b> from the <b>ocean</b> to make coastal cities more ecologically and economically sustainable. The subject {{of this study is}} San Andres, a Colombian island in the Caribbean Sea that was declared as UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in 2000 for its well-preserved ecosystem and biodiversity. Regrettably, it is currently 100 % dependent on imported fossil fuels and has a high level of greenhouse gas emission.
