5000|$|In some countries, {{the prizes}} and chances, {{and hence the}} average {{interest}} rate, is a fixed property of the bond from issue until it is redeemed, making them more predictable as investments. When the prizes and chances of each <b>bond</b> are fixed, <b>redeemed</b> <b>bonds</b> stay in the lottery, but the issuer gets to keep prizes drawn to <b>redeemed</b> or unsold <b>bonds.</b>|$|R

50|$|After three years, the {{borrower}} does decide to <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond.</b> At {{this point the}} two year gilt yields 2% and so the reference rate is 2.5%.|$|R
5000|$|... {{borrower}}’s option: linked {{option for}} the borrower (exercisable only if the lender’s option is exercised) to pay the revised interest rate or to <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> although that may involve exit fees.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] said he, [...] "that Mr. Darby {{would take}} these bonds {{at the store}} for {{groceries}} and things, and we might pay him interest, besides <b>redeeming</b> the <b>bonds</b> when they came due." ...|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{a bond with}} call {{features}} - i.e. where the issuer can <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> early - is deemed to have negative convexity as rates approach the option strike, {{which is to say}} its duration will fall as rates fall, and hence its price will rise less quickly. This is because the issuer can <b>redeem</b> the old <b>bond</b> at a high coupon and re-issue a new bond at a lower rate, thus providing the issuer with valuable optionality.|$|R
50|$|In August 1818, {{with credit}} dangerously overextended, BUS branch offices began to reject all state-chartered bank notes under the {{direction}} of William Jones. Exceptions were made for notes used as revenue payments to the US Treasury. In October 1818, The US Treasury demanded a transfer of $2 million in specie from the BUS to <b>redeem</b> <b>bonds</b> on the Louisiana Purchase. State banks in the West and South, unable to provide the required specie, began to call in their loans on the heavily mortgaged lands they had financed. Cash poor farmers and speculators found their land values dropping 50% to 75%. Banks began foreclosing on the properties and transferring them to their creditor: the Second Bank of the United States.|$|R
50|$|Note that {{convexity}} can {{be positive}} or negative. A bond with positive convexity {{will not have}} any call features - i.e. the issuer must <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> at maturity - which means that as rates fall, both its duration and price will rise.|$|R
50|$|The funds, however, were {{inadequate}} {{and some were}} misappropriated. As a result, work was stopped in June and engineers, contractors and laborers, involving some 2,000 persons in all, were left without their pay and without work. The Iowa counties, however, were compelled to <b>redeem</b> their <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
50|$|SSBs are not {{transferable}} {{but can be}} resold to the Singapore Government at any point {{of time with the}} capital guaranteed. This ensures that investors will only have upside for their investment since they can collect interest regularly and yet <b>redeem</b> their <b>bonds</b> at any point of time.|$|R
50|$|Since 1963, the Quebec {{government}} had offered Quebec Savings Bonds. Before {{the creation of}} Placements Québec, the holder was issued a physical certificate as evidence that he held the purchased product. To <b>redeem</b> his <b>bond,</b> the holder had to present the certificate he had receive {{at the time of}} purchase.|$|R
5000|$|Chase {{ruled that}} the state's {{relationship}} with White and Chiles [...] "was therefore treasonable and void." [...] Consequently, he ordered that {{the current state of}} Texas still retained ownership of the bonds and were entitled to either the return of the bonds or the payment of a cash equivalent from those parties who had successfully <b>redeemed</b> the <b>bonds.</b>|$|R
50|$|During his six-year {{tenure at}} the ministry, Rostowski oversaw an {{overhaul}} of the public finance sector, including a cap on spending growth and a decision to <b>redeem</b> sovereign <b>bonds</b> held by privately managed pension fund companies, a move that drew criticism from the fund companies and some economists. As part of a cabinet shuffle in late 2013, Tusk replaced Rostowski with Mateusz Szczurek.|$|R
50|$|The Republican {{platform}} supported black suffrage in the South {{as part of}} {{the passage}} to full citizenship for former slaves. It agreed to let northern states decide individually whether to enfranchise blacks. It opposed using greenbacks to <b>redeem</b> U.S. <b>bonds,</b> encouraged immigration, endorsed full rights for naturalized citizens, and favored Radical Reconstruction as distinct from the more lenient policy of President Andrew Johnson.|$|R
5000|$|A Government bond in a country's own {{currency}} is strictly speaking a risk-free bond, {{because the government}} can if necessary create additional currency in order to <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> at maturity. There have however been instances where a government has chosen to default on its domestic currency debt, such as Russia in 1998 (the [...] "ruble crisis") (see national bankruptcy).|$|R
50|$|Texas {{argued that}} it was a well {{established}} legal principle that if the original transfer to White and Chiles was invalid, then the subsequent transfers were also invalid. Chiles and White might be liable to such purchasers and any purchasers who had successfully <b>redeemed</b> the <b>bonds</b> were liable for a personal judgment in favor of the state for the amount they received.|$|R
50|$|The CSR's banker, Kenyon, Cox & Co. (of which Drew {{was general}} partner) failed, and its bonds were {{subsequently}} protested, although some observers {{felt that the}} move was unnecessary.

40|$|Workers who delay {{retirement}} {{can save}} more and con-tribute {{more to the}} economy. Urban Institute simula-tions show that someone who works an extra five years could increase retirement spending by more than half. Also, work-inducing reforms—rather than reforms that simply reduce benefits—help close the Social Security funding gap. Delayed Retirement Could Ease Logjam An aging population and the approaching retirement of the largest birth cohort in U. S. history could mean a shortfall in promised Social Security benefits in 2017. After that, with baby boomers retiring in hoards, Social Security {{would be required to}} <b>redeem</b> <b>bonds</b> held by its Trust Funds. According to current projections, all Trust Fund assets will be depleted by 2041. This brief examines how changes in retirement behavior and reforms that encourage workers to stay on the job longer could ease the long-term funding logjam. The effectiveness of these changes is gauged using pro-jections of retirement age, Social Security take-up age, pensions, Social Security benefits, taxes, and other sig-nificant sources of income in retirement from the Urba...|$|R
50|$|Relatively few {{investors are}} willing to invest in {{currencies}} {{that do not have}} a long track record of stability. A disadvantage for a government issuing bonds in a foreign currency {{is that there is a}} risk that it will not be able to obtain the foreign currency to pay the interest or <b>redeem</b> the <b>bonds.</b> In 1997 and 1998, during the Asian financial crisis, this became a serious problem when many countries were unable to keep their exchange rate fixed due to speculative attacks.|$|R
5000|$|The Ohio {{idea was}} an idea by poor Midwesterners during the US presidential {{election}} of 1868 to <b>redeem</b> federal war <b>bonds</b> in United States dollars, {{also known as}} greenbacks, rather than gold. Agrarian Democrats hoped to keep more money in circulation to keep interest rates lower.|$|R
50|$|Born into {{a family}} owning cotton mills which {{supplied}} barter goods to businesses in the slave-trade, Thomas {{was the first of}} the Hibbert family to settle in Jamaica, arriving in 1734 (his youngest brother, John (1732-1769), also lived in Jamaica, from 1754 until his death; his other brother, Robert, was father of Thomas, a co-founder of the family trading business Hibbert, Purrier and Horton, and merchant and pro-slavery campaigner George Hibbert). His original remit was to <b>redeem</b> the <b>bonds</b> of slave traders at the point at which they sold their slaves in Kingston.|$|R
50|$|A {{callable}} bond (also called redeemable bond) {{is a type}} of bond (debt security) that allows the issuer of the bond to retain the privilege of <b>redeeming</b> the <b>bond</b> at some point before the bond reaches its date of maturity. In other words, on the call date(s), the issuer has the right, but not the obligation, to buy back the bonds from the bond holders at a defined call price. Technically speaking, the bonds are not really bought and held by the issuer but are instead cancelled immediately.|$|R
50|$|However, {{when the}} US Treasury called the fourth bond on April 15, 1934, it {{defaulted}} on this term {{by refusing to}} <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> in gold, and neither did it account for the devaluation of the dollar from $20.67 per troy ounce of gold (the 1918 standard of value) to $35 per ounce. The 21 million bond holders therefore lost 139 million troy ounces of gold, or approximately 41% of the bond's principal. This {{was the equivalent of}} $2.866 billion (in 1918 dollars), or approximately $220 billion at the 2012 price of $1600 per ounce.|$|R

40|$|Clawback {{provisions}} {{allow the}} issuer to partially <b>redeem</b> a <b>bond</b> issue often {{within three years}} of issuance using proceeds only from new equity issues. Empirical evidence indicates the clawback provision is rarely exercised. This poses an interesting dilemma as clawback provisions are an expensive source of funding, often commanding yields that are significantly higher than traditional corporate bonds. We develop a simple model that provides a rationale for the scarcity of call redemptions and the higher yields of clawback bonds. The model predicts a relation between issuance of clawback bonds, cash flow volatility and the probability of renegotiation of clawback debt contracts...|$|R

50|$|A {{government}} bond is a bond issued {{by a national}} government. Such bonds are most often denominated in the country's domestic currency. Sovereigns can also issue debt in foreign currencies: almost 70% of all debt in 2000 was denominated in US dollars. Government bonds are sometimes regarded as risk-free bonds, because national governments can if necessary create money de novo to <b>redeem</b> the <b>bond</b> in their own currency at maturity. Although many governments are prohibited by law from creating money directly (that function having been delegated to their central banks), central banks may provide finance by buying {{government bond}}s, {{sometimes referred to as}} monetizing the debt.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the bonds}} were sold, a Texas Unionist {{notified}} the Treasury which ran a legal {{notice in the}} New York Tribune {{that it would not}} honor any bonds from Texas unless they were endorsed by the prewar governor (Sam Houston). [...] Despite the warning, 136 bonds were purchased by a brokerage owned by George W. White and John Chiles. Although this sale probably occurred earlier, the written confirmation of the transaction was not executed until January 12, 1865. The bonds were in the meantime resold to several individuals, one or more of whom were able to successfully <b>redeem</b> the <b>bonds</b> through the United States government.|$|R

500|$|There {{were two}} main {{divisive}} issues in 1868. The {{first was the}} continued Reconstruction of the South. The Democrats advocated allowing former Confederate soldiers to hold elective offices, and the Republicans endorsed the proposed Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution which allowed African Americans to vote. The other controversial issue concerned the redemption of war bonds either in gold or paper money known as greenbacks. The Democrats wanted to <b>redeem</b> the <b>bonds</b> with $100,000,000 in greenbacks and the rest with gold. The greenbacks were known as [...] "cheap money" [...] and would be inflationary. The Republicans wanted to pay the redemption of war bonds only with gold, a position attractive to investors and bankers.|$|R

In exchange, the issuer has an option at the maturity date to either <b>redeem</b> the <b>bonds</b> in cash or {{to deliver a}} pre-specified number of shares. We find that Dutch plain vanilla and knock-in RC bonds are, on average, overpriced by almost 6 %. This overpricing is confirmed in a model-free analysis with respect to option- and bond-pricing models. We find that rational factors explain 23 % of the documented overpricing. In addition, {{we find that the}} combination of financial marketing, framing, and the representativeness bias further increases our ability to explain the documented overpricing to more than 35 %...|$|R
