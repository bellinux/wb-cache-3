The committee consisted of Allen Young, C. Rivers Wilson, Thomas Ismay, and two or three naval officers. [...] The committee noted that although traditionally the merchant navy was looked upon as a pool of trained sailors which could be called upon in wartime, the proportion of non-British sailors in British ships was steadily increasing. Moreover, that modern warships were becoming increasingly different from merchant ships, so it was felt a man could not simply be called from a merchantman and placed into a naval ship. A system of reserves was required where men received training and a <b>retainer</b> <b>fee</b> to be ready for war service when needed. Tryon felt it important that men from the reserve should wear the same uniform as regular sailors, so that no sense of inferiority might attach to them. Tryon had been impressed by the quality of merchant sailors serving in the Naval Brigade in Crimea.|$|E

40|$|What’s not to {{like about}} {{retainer}} medicine? Patientsand physicians both want unhurried visits, im-proved access, and better continuity and coordination of care. Physicians also welcome less stress and higher income per hour of clinical practice. In contemporary business par-lance, retainer medicine is a win–win situation—as long as you’re part of the “in ” group. Critics charge that retainer medicine is unethical be-cause it increases disparities and poor access to primary care. Furthermore, now that Medicare covers an annual wellness visit, <b>retainer</b> <b>fees</b> that cover an executive physical examination may run afoul of Medicare bans on double-billing (1).

40|$|Management {{scholars}} and economists have recently {{set out the}} requirements of a system to elicit good performance when {{it is necessary to}} align the interests of the principal and agent. We analyse pay and performance in an occupation — jockeys — replete with moral hazard possibilities. We are able to do this because, most unusually, a measure of pure individual performance exists for an unbalanced panel of some 50 individuals for 8 years. Three hypotheses are tested. First, in line with classic agency theory, we expect monitoring mechanisms and incentive contracts to be used to align the interests of principals and agents. Second, pay and performance should be positively associated, subject to the first hypothesis being confirmed. Third, a limited number of jockeys were paid via an alternative mechanism involving very large non-contingent <b>retainer</b> <b>fees.</b> This serves as our counterfactual payment system. In line with agency theory we expect worse performance under such a system than under an incentive contract. The three hypotheses are confirmed: incentive contracts generate superior performance to non-contingent payment systems. Our evidence suggests that 'it's not what you pay it's the way that you pay it … and that's what gets results'...|$|R

An advance payment retainer became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of retainer defined by the court included the classic retainer (also known as a true retainer) and the security retainer. A classic retainer was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security retainer referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|R

50|$|There {{are three}} forms of brokers compensation: hourly, <b>retainer,</b> and success <b>fee</b> (commission upon a closing). A broker may use any one, or {{combination}} of these when providing services.

Just as major investment banks normally charge a retainer for services, more business brokers have started to embrace this practice as well. The retainer helps cover the upfront costs incurred by the broker to perform services and shows a commitment {{on the part of the}} client (seller or buyer) that they are serious.

40|$|As {{physicians}} seek innovative practice models, {{one that}} is gain-ing ground is for practices to contract with patients to pay di-rectly for some or all services—often called cash-only, retainer, boutique, concierge, or direct primary care or specialty care practices. Such descriptions {{do not reflect the}} variability found in prac-tices. For the purposes of this paper, the American College of Physicians (ACP) defines a direct patient contracting practice (DPCP) as any practice that directly contracts with patients to pay out-of-pocket for {{some or all of the}} services provided by the practice, in lieu of or in addition to traditional insurance arrange-ments, and/or charges an administrative fee to patients, some-times called a <b>retainer</b> or concierge <b>fee,</b> often in return for a promise of more personalized and accessible care. This defini-tion encompasses the practice types previously described. The move to DPCPs is based on the premise that access and quality of care will be improved without third-party payers im-posing themselves between the patient and the physician. Yet concerns have been raised that DPCPs may cause access issues for patients who cannot afford to pay directly for care. This ACP position paper, initiated and written by its Medical Practice and Quality Committee and approved by the Board of Regents on 25 July 2015, assesses the impact of DPCPs on ac-cess, cost, and quality; discusses principles from the ACP Ethics Manual, Sixth Edition, that should apply to all practice types; and makes recommendations to mitigate any adverse effect on un-derserved patients...|$|R
