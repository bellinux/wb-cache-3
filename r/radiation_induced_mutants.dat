40|$|The mutational {{effects of}} {{ionising}} radiation at the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) locus were studied in human peripheral blood G(0) phase lymphocytes irradiated in vitro with gamma rays. The presence of <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> <b>mutants</b> {{was assessed by}} selecting the HPRT mutants every week {{on the basis of}} 6 -thioguanine resistance up to 1 month after irradiation. A dose-related increase of 14. 25 x 10 (- 6) mutants/Gy was measured after an expression time of 7 days. After 2 weeks from culture starting the fraction of clonable cells in irradiated and control cell populations decreased, limiting the measurements of mutant frequency. The mutational spectrum of the HPRT gene was determined by PCR analyses in a total of 99 mutant clones derived from irradiated lymphocytes. The independent origin of mutant clones carrying the same mutation was assessed by analysing the TCR gamma gene rearrangements. The results showed a dose-related increase of deletion mutants up to 3 Gy, whereas point mutation frequency increased only up to 2 Gy. Two preferentially deleted regions were identified; one involving the HPRT exon 3, and another one the 3 '-terminal and the 3 '-flanking region of the gene. One complex mutation involving a non-contiguous deletion of exons 2 - 5 and 7 / 8 was observed among the mutants isolated after 3 Gy irradiation...|$|E

40|$|Clonally {{propagated}} bermudagrass {{constitute a}} major source of turf in the Southern United States. Most of parents for the clonally propagated bermudagrasses were initially introduced from other countries at some time in the past. Few of the cultivars were introduced from China by researchers in the Oklahoma State Agricultural Experimental Station. The objective of this DAF project was to determine the degree of genetic relatedness of these newintroduced Chinese cultivars with the existing vegetative cultivars commonly grown in the United States by using DNA fingerprinting technique (DAF). A total of 89 bands were scored using four DAF primers. The cluster analysis was able to distinguish all the varieties studied into 6 distinct groups indicating the existence of wide genetic variations in the cultivars examined. Tifton 10 showed near similarity coefficient to the Chinese cultivars, the cultivar Tifton 10 was directly increased by the plant collection in Shanghai China by Glenn W. Burton. The closer grouping of Tifton 10 with the recently introduced Chinese accessions indicates the existence of similarity of germplasm within China. The cultivar Tifsport a <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> <b>mutant</b> from ‘Midiron’ bermudagrass and Tifway,were the most closely related varieties with an SC of 0. 94. The two cultivars Tifsport and Tifway which are morphologically undistinguishable showed a very similar banding pattern indicating these cultivars to be nearly identical.

40|$|Investigation of <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> {{damage in}} <b>mutant</b> strains of {{mammalian}} cells which show a {{defect in the}} rejoining of DNA double strand breaks provides an unique opportunity to examine the role of double strand breaks and the mechanisms of double strand break rejoining {{in the production of}} chromosome aberrations. This is particularly important, because there is increasing evidence that the DNA double strand break is the major lesion responsible for the formation of chromosome aberrations. To address this issue, we studied the induction of chromosome aberrations in xrs- 5 cells, an x-ray sensitive strain of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line, which shows a defect in the rejoining of double strand breaks and their wild-type parent CHO-cells. Because radiosensitivity depends strongly on cellular age, the experiments were performed with synchronous cells...|$|R

40|$|The {{original}} goal of {{this work}} {{was to determine the}} capacity of selected aminothiols to modulate <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> cytotoxicity, mutagenesis and carcinogenesis in a human mammary epithelial cell line.

While a potent radiation protector, WR- 1065 is cytotoxic in vitro and in vivo. Our rationale for a study of the thiazolidine pro-drugs was that these compounds are neither toxic in vitro or in vivo. The results obtained during this funding period indicate that the thiazolidine pro-drugs are as potent as WR- 1065 as protectors against <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> mutation induction, and thus presumably against <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> carcinogenesis.

40|$|Dysregulation {{of certain}} microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer can promote tumorigenesis, {{metastasis}} and invasion. However, the functions and targets {{of only a}} few mammalian miRNAs are known. In particular, the miRNAs that participates in <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> carcinogenesis and the miRNAs that target the tumor suppressor gene Big-h 3 remain undefined. Here in this study, using a <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> thymic lymphoma model in BALB/c mice, we found that the tumor suppressor gene Big-h 3 is down-regulated and miR- 21 is up-regulated in <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> thymic lymphoma tissue samples. We also found inverse correlations between Big-h 3 protein and miR- 21 expression level among different tissue samples. Furthermore, our data indicated that miR- 21 could directly target Big-h 3 in a 3 &# 8242;UTR dependent manner. Finally, we found that miR- 21 could be induced by TGF&# 946;, and miR- 21 has both positive and negative effects in regulating TGF&# 946; signaling.

Here we a report a case of <b>radiation</b> <b>induced</b> osteosarcoma which developed 11 [*]years after a single fraction of 700 [*]cGy.
