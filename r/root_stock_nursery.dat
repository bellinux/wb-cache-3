40|$|The sting nematode, Belonolaimus longicaudatus, was {{associated}} with poor growth of citrus in a central Florida nursery. Foliage of trees was sparse and chlorotic. Affected rootstocks included Changsha and Cleopatra mandarin orange; Flying Dragon, Rubidoux, and Jacobsen trifoliate orange; Macrophylla and Milam lemon; Palestine sweet lime; sour orange; and the hybrids - Carrizo, Morton, and Rusk citrange and Swingle citrumelo. Root symptoms included apical swelling, development of swollen terminals containing 3 - 5 apical meristems and hyperplastic tissue, coarse roots, {{and a reduction in}} the number of fibrous roots. Population densities as high as 392 sting nematodes per liter soil were detected, with 80 % of the population occurring in the top 30 cm of soil; however, nematodes were detected to 107 cm deep.

40|$|Root loss during {{transplanting}} of bare <b>rooted</b> <b>nursery</b> <b>stock</b> {{is thought}} to limit water uptake during establishment. An initial investigation into the effects on growth under well watered conditions of progressive removal of root material from dormant trees of Betula pendula Roth. {{was set up in}} spring 1994. Trees with roots ??? 1 mm removed (40 % removal by mass) and with roots ??? 5 mm removed (84 % removal by mass) were compared to controls. Some limited measurements of water relations were also made. Shoot and root growth were increasingly limited by progressive root removal. Root regrowth was apparently proportional to the amount of old root material left behind after transplanting. In addition, the most severe treatment (roots ??? 5 mm were removed) limited root growth in favour of shoot growth. Direct measurements of water relations proved to be difficult and inconclusive, however, increases in stem diameter, an indirect measurement of changes in water relations, indicated that progressive root removal subtly increased water stress in the trees. Alternative hypotheses for the observed of changes in growth based on limitations in sugar physiology and hormone imbalance are also discussed. ?? AB Academic Publishers 2004...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1984 This thesis {{examines}} the competitive aspects of Douglas-fir trees growing with two commonly associated competitors [...] red alder and grass [...] at varying densities. Two Nelder plots {{in three different}} environments in the Oregon Coast Range were studied. The sites represented the warm, dry climate of the Willamette Valley; the warm, moist climate of the valleys of the mid-range; and the cool, moist climate found along the fog belt {{a few miles from}} the Pacific Ocean. Plots ranged in spacing from 300 to 15250 cm²/tree and consisted of six "pie-shaped" treatments. The plots had been previously planted in the spring of 1978 with 2 - 0 bare <b>root</b> Douglas-fir <b>nursery</b> <b>stock.</b> Two sections were interplanted with red alder, and two sections were broadcast seeded with grass the following year. Measurements indicate that Douglas-fir growth is inhibited by red alder and grass competition as well as competition from other Douglas-fir. Grass competition is severe only during the initial years of the plantation, while red alder competition becomes more pronounced with time. Growth is a function of density, competitor type, and site, and significant interactions occur among the three. Leaf area per tree of Douglas-fir under competition can be predicted by leaf weight, stand density, and competitor type. The formation of shade needles in response to density and competitor type increases the leaf area:leaf weight ratio. Growth efficiency (stemwood volume production/unit of leaf area) is not highest for the most vigorous trees. On a per hectare basis, high productivity is correlated with high leaf area index, but the relation is reversed on a per tree basis...|$|R

40|$|A {{disorder}} {{causing the}} cracking of bark {{in the lower}} trunk region of seedlings and in the <b>root</b> <b>stock</b> of bud-grafted trees of Hevea brasiliensis was observed recently. A preliminary investigation was carried {{out for the first}} time to study the occurrence, symptoms, its relationship to the genotype of clones or seedlings, age and growth of trees. The observations were that, this disorder appears only after about three years of establishment and reaches a high percentage in about seven years and is completely absent in bud wood nurseries. Bud-grafted trees with the disorder had a greater girth than those unaffected. The genotype of the scion in bud-grafted trees did not have a significant influence on the occurrence of this disorder. The nature and the symptoms of this disorder do not show the involvement of a pathogen of, but secondary infections may be the reason for bark decay around cracks.
