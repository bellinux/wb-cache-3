5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH <b>ratio.</b> This <b>ratio</b> {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH <b>ratio</b> are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the <b>ratio</b> between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the <b>ratio</b> is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The <b>ratio</b> of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH <b>ratio</b> is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme.

Estimated risk <b>ratios</b> were calculated when possible and compared with odds <b>ratios.</b> Results: One hundred and twenty-eight articles using odds <b>ratios</b> were identifi ed.

40|$|Aims Our {{objective}} is to test whether C and N releases in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) litter change monotonically or unimodally with soil nutrients in its habitats. Methods We conducted a growth experiment where winter wheat was subjected to 6 -level nutrient regimes and a common garden decomposition experiment. We determined initial C:N <b>ratios</b> of live tissues, biomass loss of litters, C:N <b>ratios</b> of remaining litter, and the amounts of C and N releases. We analyzed correlations between initial C:N <b>ratios</b> and C/N release or between C:N <b>ratios.</b> All data were analyzed with SPSS 13. 0 and R 2. 9. 1. Important findings Litterfall, initial leaf/root C:N <b>ratios,</b> C:N <b>ratios</b> of remaining litter, and C and N releases changed monotonically along a soil nutrient gradient. Soil nutrients had significant effects on biomass loss of leaves, but not of roots. There were negative correlations between initial leaf/root C:N <b>ratios</b> and C and N releases. Initial leaf/root C:N <b>ratios</b> were strongly and positively correlated with C:N <b>ratios</b> of remaining litter. These findings suggest that (1) increased soil nutrients surrounding winter wheat plants enhance C and N return in litter, thereby being beneficial to its growth, (2) C:N <b>ratios</b> indicate the potential amounts of C and N releases, and (3) decomposition processes decrease C:N <b>ratios</b> in remaining litter...|$|R
