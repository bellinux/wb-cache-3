40|$|Valves {{are used}} in many domains and often have system-critical functions. As such, it is {{important}} to monitor the health of <b>valves</b> and their <b>actuators</b> and predict remaining useful life. In this work, we develop a model-based prognostics approach for a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> <b>actuator.</b> Due to limited observability of the component with multiple failure modes, a lumped damage approach is proposed for estimation and prediction of damage progression. In order to support the goal of real-time prognostics, an approach to prediction is developed that does not require online simulation to compute remaining life, rather, a function mapping the damage state to remaining useful life is found offline so that predictions can be made quickly online with a single function evaluation. Simulation results demonstrate the overall methodology, validating the lumped damage approach and demonstrating real-time prognostics...|$|R

Many variations of the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> have been invented in the past half-century such as the Thayer valve or axial-flow Valve, the Hagmann valve, the Greenhoe rotor, and several others, all of which were designed to give the trombone a more open, free sound than a conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> would allow. Many of these new trombone valve designs have enjoyed great success on the market, but the standard <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> remains the most common for trombone valve attachments.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage being generated from the use of a drop-through <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> in a full-scale pneumatic conveying system. When producing a set ofpneumatic conveying characteristics for a test program, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage is often not considered. In reality, the air mass flowrate in the conveying line will be less than the total supplied air mass flowrate due to air leakage through the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve.</b> By measuring the air leakage and adjusting the total supplied air mass flowrate to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the conveying line, a more accurate representation of the conveying conditions can be obtained. Hence the design of pneumatic conveying systems can be determined more precisely. Tests have been performed and plots have been produced showing both the pneumatic conveying characteristics before and after <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage has been taken into account. These results show that <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage can have quite an effect, with some tests losing more than 50010 ofthe supplied air mass flowrate through the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve...</b>|$|R

A number of issues arise in the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> system, the main one being <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage.

50|$|Initially, most valved {{instruments}} were offered in <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> configurations with piston valve cornet and alto horn {{being the only}} exceptions. The <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is a string operated dual-bored axial valve actuated by a lever pressed with the fingers.

50|$|On <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> engines {{the process}} is similar except instead of a reed, a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is used (incorporated in the crankshaft), which opens and closes as the piston moves up and down. The <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> is more {{efficient}} and adjustable (at design time) {{as there is a}} larger and clearer path to the crankcase than in the reed valve setup, but such engines can run in only one direction; pusher configurations require a special propeller, sometimes difficult to find.|$|R

Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuators</b> are used to eliminate the camshaft of an existing Internal Combustion(IC) engine and to control the valve timing of intake and exhaust valves, valve duration independently. This paper presents a research activity like hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator</b> design, dynamic simulations, analysis and adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator.</b> Electro-Hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>actuator’s</b> main function is to provide fully variable open/close valve timing. The Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system has been modeled {{by means of a}} powerful hydraulic simulation tool, AMESim, which is useful for the dynamic simulations and analysis of hydraulic systems. The designed model has been validated through comparison with mathematical model and experimental results obtained in a prototype test bench. This research is focused on Adaptive valve timing control of Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system. A proposed valve timing control in this paper is used to robustly control opening timing, duration, closing timing regardless of fluid temperature variations without high-cost sensors. Test bench data and simulation results indicate that a Camless Engine <b>Valve</b> <b>Actuator</b> (CEVA) system would verify the effectiveness and feasibility of a fully variable valve timing technology...|$|R

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> are {{potentially}} highly suitable for high-revving engines, {{such as those}} used in racing sportscars and F1 racing cars, on which traditional poppet valves with springs can fail due to valve float and spring resonance and where the desmodromic valve gear is too heavy, large in size and too complex to time and design properly. <b>Rotary</b> <b>valves</b> could allow for a more compact and lightweight cylinder head design. They rotate at half engine speed and lack the inertia forces of reciprocating valve mechanisms. This allows for higher engine speeds, offering approximately perhaps 10% more power. The 1980s MGN W12 F1 engine used <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> but never raced. Between 2002 and 2004 the Australian developer Bishop Innovation and Mercedes-Ilmor tested <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> for a F1 V10 engine.|$|R
40|$|Efficient {{high-speed}} on/off valves are {{a critical}} technology for enabling digital control of hydraulic systems via pulse-widthmodulation (PWM). High-speed valves, {{when used in}} virtually variable displacement pumps (VVDP), increase system bandwidth and reduce output pressure ripple by enabling higher PWM frequencies. Our approach to achieving high speed and large flow area with low actuation power is a unidirectional <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> designed specifically for PWM. In comparison to conventional <b>valves,</b> the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> reduces valve actuation power from a cubic dependence on PWM frequency to a square dependence by eliminating motion reversals during transition. This paper presents experimental data that validates the <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> concept, valve design equations, and dynamic model of a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> based VVDP. Our unoptimized prototype exhibits 65 % efficiency at 50 % displacement and 15 Hz PWM frequency while the validated model projects that an optimized valve is capable of achieving 85 % efficiency at 15 Hz and 73 % at 75 Hz...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explains}} the procedure {{used to determine}} the amount of air leakage expelled from two different sized drop-through <b>rotary</b> <b>valves.</b> When designing a pneumatic conveying system, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage may be overlooked, believed to be only a minor factor. This is somewhat true when conveying in dilute-phase where low pressures are generated, however in dense-phase pneumatic conveying where higher pressures can be produced, <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage can be a high proportion of the supplied air. Knowing the air leakage present for any given situation, the total supplied air mass flowrate can be adjusted to represent the actual air mass flowrate travelling through the conveying line, thus giving a more accurate representation of the actual conveying conditions. A series of tests have been performed from which a series of graphs have been produced. Comparisons have been made for the air leakage through the different sized <b>rotary</b> <b>valves</b> and also these results have been compared to two existing models used in the prediction of <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> air leakage...|$|R

In this study, the attrition effects occurring in a <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> operating as a stand-alone device and as part of a pneumatic conveying system were investigated. In the former case granular attrition was carried out at three different <b>rotary</b> <b>valve</b> speeds and the experimental results obtained were found to be in good agreement with the Gwyn correlation. In the latter case three typical air flow rates were used in the pneumatic conveying system. The size distribution of the attrition product obtained at the lowest air flow rate used was not adequately described by the Gwyn correlation.
