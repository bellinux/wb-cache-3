40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>rociverine,</b> an antispasmodic drug, for reducing the duration of labor among nulliparous women managed according to a standard intrapartum protocol. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: An academic tertiary care hospital. POPULATION: Nulliparae in spontaneous active labor, with cervical dilatation between 3 and 5 cm. METHODS: Participants {{were randomly assigned to}} receive either an intramuscular injection of 20 mg <b>rociverine</b> (n= 55) or the same volume of saline (n= 56). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Cervical dilatation rate (from administration of study drug to full dilatation). RESULTS: Laboring women who received <b>rociverine</b> had faster cervical dilatation than those assigned to placebo (2. 43 ± 1. 84 vs. 1. 85 ± 1. 38 cm/hour, p= 0. 03). The time interval from treatment administration to full cervical dilatation was shorter in the <b>rociverine</b> group than in the placebo group (220 ± 125 vs. 278 ± 129 min, p= 0. 04). No difference was found in any other obstetric outcome. No adverse effects have been recorded from <b>rociverine</b> administration. CONCLUSIONS: Intrapartum administration of <b>rociverine</b> to nulliparous women may help to reduce the duration of the first stage of labor in a context of uniform labor management...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and {{validate}} a method to assess the dissolution behaviour of <b>rociverine</b> sugar-coated tablets. In our laboratories, an HPLC-MS in reverse phase method of analysis was developed for the dosage of unknown <b>rociverine</b> solution. This analytical method was applied to determine the dissolution rate of <b>rociverine</b> tablets produced by the industrial procedure, {{because there is no}} official method description. Dissolution tests were carried out in sink conditions as follows: dissolution medium HCl 0. 01 N, paddle rotation speed 50 rpm and vessel volume 1000 ml. The dissolution test gave satisfactory results: 95 % of the drug was dissolved within 30 min and drug dissolution was concluded after 60 min. The method was demonstrated to be adequate for Quality Control of <b>rociverine</b> tablets. Validation was inferred from specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness...|$|E
40|$|Racemic cyclohexyl(hydroxymethyl) {{cyclohexanol}} I (R = H), {{a precursor}} of the antimuscarinic drug <b>Rociverine,</b> was obtained diastereospecifically in very high yield, from the Grignard reaction between C 6 H 11 MgCl and an appropriately protected 2 -(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexanone.  The prepn. of enantiomerically enriched (+) -(1 R, 2 S) -(hydroxymethyl) cyclohexanol II {{and the corresponding}} 2 -acetoxymethyl deriv. (+) -(1 S, 2 R) -I (R = Ac) was achieved by lipase PPL-catalyzed transesterification of racemic I (R = H) with vinyl acetate...|$|E
40|$|The {{chemical}} structure corresponding to 1 -hydroxy[1, 1 '-bicyclohexyl]- 2 -carboxylic acid 2 -(diethylamino) - 1 -methylethyl ester has the classical profile of ester-type antimuscarinic drugs. The presence of three chiral carbons leads to eight stereoisomers and the substitutions on the cyclohexyl ring generate cis-isomers (1, named <b>rociverine)</b> and trans-isomers (2). The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the binding pattern of the eight stereoisomers and two derived compounds, (1 S, 2 S) - 1 -hydroxy[1, 1 '-bicyclohexyl]- 2 -carboxylic acid 2 -(dimethylamino) - 1 -ethyl ester (3) (1 S, 2 S) - 1 -hydroxy[1, 1 '-bicyclohexyl]- 2 -carboxylic acid (S) - 2 -(diethylamino) - 1 -methylethyl ester methyl iodide (4), at the five cloned muscarinic receptors stably expressed in chinese hamster ovary cells, in order to define how stereochemical modifications could affect the affinity. Our data showed that cis-stereoisomers exhibited higher variations in affinity than trans-stereoisomers. Among the cis-stereoisomers, those with the (1 R, 2 R) configuration showed considerably higher affinities (up to 240 -fold) than those with the (1 S, 2 S) configuration. The (1 S, 2 S) configuration was important for binding selectivity; this was confirmed also by the use of the two additional compounds...|$|E
