5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} Royal Commission's report {{about to be}} published, the GNP {{returned}} to Parliament with two bills for consideration. The first bill revived the 1903 proposal for a branch from Piccadilly Circus to the City of London, passing and interchanging with Strand station. The second proposed an extension and <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> Strand station to the junction of Strand and Surrey Street. From there the line was to continue as a single tunnel under the River Thames to Waterloo. The first bill was again delayed and withdrawn. Of the second, only the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> Strand station was permitted.|$|E

40|$|Regional wildlife–habitat {{models are}} {{commonly}} developed but rarely tested with truly independent data. We tested a published habitat model for black bears (Ursus americanus) with new data {{collected in a}} different site in the same ecological region (i. e., Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma, USA). We used a Mahalanobis distance model developed from <b>relocations</b> <b>of</b> black bears in Arkansas to produce a map layer of Mahalanobis distances on a study area in neighboring Oklahoma. We tested this modeled map layer with <b>relocations</b> <b>of</b> black bears on the Oklahoma area. The distributions <b>of</b> <b>relocations</b> <b>of</b> female black bears were consistent with model predictions. We conclude that this modeling approach {{can be used to}} predict regional suitability for a species of interest...|$|R

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the attempt to relocate the Timberwolves, the New Orleans Regional Basketball Alliance sought to lure an existing franchise to the city. After completion of the New Orleans Arena, the Alliance led efforts to relocate the Vancouver Grizzlies to the city. The New Orleans bid ultimately lost out to Memphis, and by early 2002 the city looked to the Charlotte Hornets to potentially relocate to the city. The Hornets became attractive to relocate following a failed referendum for a new arena in Charlotte. On May 10, 2002, the NBA {{voted in favor of}} the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the Hornets to New Orleans marking the return of the NBA to the city since the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the New Orleans Jazz to Salt Lake City in 1979.

40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three chapters describing my investigations of nest-site selection, ectoparasites, and nest <b>relocations</b> <b>of</b> burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia) in southwestern Idaho. The purpose of my field research was to (1) determine how chamber size and tunnel diameter influenced selection of artificial burrow systems, (2) identify ectoparasite species of owls and examine their potential effects on nesting success, site reuse, growth, and survival, and (3) investigate the efficacy <b>of</b> short-distance <b>relocations</b> <b>of</b> occupied burrowing owl nests. Information contained in this thesis should be {{of particular interest to}} those investigating nest-site selection processes in cavity-nesting species and to those resource managers involved with the active management and conservation of burrowing owls...|$|R

5|$|A {{large area}} of the grounds between the asylum main {{buildings}} and Princess Street was allocated to Children's Cottages in 1885. When the Children's Cottages became a separate institution, the area surrounding the cottages became no longer under asylum management and was no longer for asylum inmate use. Widening and straightening of Princess Street in 1939-1940 resulted in the demolishing of Kew's gatehouses, loss of land and the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> the main gates to Victoria Park, Kew. Construction of Yarra Boulevard during the 1930s led to {{a section of the}} asylum's river frontage being acquired by the roads department.|$|E

5|$|Before 2000, 13.4% of Nablus' {{residents}} {{worked in}} Israel, with the figure dropping to 4.7% in 2004. The city's manufacturing sector made up 15.7% {{of the economy}} in 2004, a drop from 21% in 2000. Since 2000, most of the workforce has been employed in agriculture and local trade. In the wake of the Intifada, unemployment rates rose from 14.2% in 1997 to 60% in 2004. According to an OCHA report in 2008, {{one of the reasons for}} the high unemployment was a ring of checkpoints around the city, leading to the <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> many businesses.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} had a {{much harder}} time, because the country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced <b>relocation</b> <b>of</b> their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
