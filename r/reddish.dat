5|$|Boletus roseolateritius, {{known from}} Mississippi, has a cap that changes color {{according}} to its age: it is initially dark <b>reddish</b> to orangish, later <b>reddish</b> brown at maturity, fading to brownish orange or brownish pink with dull yellow tints, and finally turning dull dingy yellow in age. Its pale yellow stipe lacks the <b>reddish</b> coloration and the hairs found {{on the base of}} B.subluridellus. Microscopically, it has smaller spores, measuring 8.5–12 by 3.5–4.5μm. Boletus rufocinnamomeus is also similar in appearance, but can be distinguished by its yellow stipe that is dotted with orange-cinnamon to brownish dots. Boletus flammans, another blue-bruising lookalike found in the southeastern United States, grows under conifers. It has a <b>reddish</b> stipe with fine reticulations on its upper half.|$|E

5|$|Oryzomys antillarum was a {{medium-sized}} rodent, about {{as large as}} O.couesi. According to Thomas's description, the upperparts were <b>reddish,</b> slightly brighter on the rump and more grayish on the head. The color of the upperparts graded into that of the underparts, which were yellowish. The hairs of the underparts were grayish at the bases. The small ears were black on the outer and yellow {{on the inner side}} and the upper surfaces of the hands and feet were whitish. The tail was nearly naked and was light brownish above and lighter below. Goldman wrote that the specimens in the USNM were rather more <b>reddish,</b> but their color may have been altered because they had been preserved in alcohol. Coues had described these as rusty brown above and washed with the same color below. Andrew Arata compared the USNM specimens with examples of the <b>reddish</b> Florida subspecies of the marsh rice rat, Oryzomys palustris natator, for Ray and found that they were more <b>reddish</b> than even the most strongly colored animals from Florida.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{intermediate}} in size for the Akodon boliviensis species group; it {{is smaller than}} A.polopi and A.sylvanus, but larger than A.boliviensis and A.caenosus. The more distantly related A.budini and A.simulator, which occur in the same area, are larger. Akodon spegazzinii is variable in coloration, ranging from light to dark and from <b>reddish</b> to yellowish brown. In general, animals in wetter, lower-lying areas are darker, and those in open, dry environments are paler. There is also variation within populations, and sometimes young mice are darker and lactating females are more <b>reddish.</b> The formerly recognized species Akodon tucumanensis corresponds to the dark, low-altitude populations, while A.leucolimnaeus and A.alterus represent more <b>reddish,</b> high-altitude animals.|$|E
5|$|The twigs of the {{red maple}} are <b>reddish</b> in color and {{somewhat}} shiny with small lenticels. Dwarf shoots are present on many branches. The buds are usually blunt and greenish to <b>reddish</b> in color, generally with several loose scales. The lateral buds are slightly stalked, and in addition there may be collateral buds present as well. The buds form in fall and winter and are often visible from a distance due to their <b>reddish</b> tint. The leaf scars on the twig are V-shaped and contain 3 bundle scars.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria botrytis include its large size, the orange, <b>reddish,</b> or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has <b>reddish</b> terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter spores. Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has branches that are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth spores. The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has <b>reddish</b> to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to <b>reddish,</b> R.subbotrytis has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E
5|$|Eleven main colours are {{recognised}} by {{the breed}} association (most including many different shades): light grey, grey, white, emsket (dusky bluish-grey), musket (light greyish-brown), shaela (dark steely-grey), black, fawn, moorit (<b>reddish</b> brown), mioget (honey-toned, yellowish-brown), and dark brown.|$|E
5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Harrya chromapes are readily {{identified}} in the field by their rosy color, bright yellow stipe base, and <b>reddish</b> scabers on the stipe. Tylopilus subchromapes is a similar species found in Australia. Tylopilus ballouii has a more orangish cap and lacks the distinctive chrome-yellow stipe base. Harrya atriceps is a closely related rare species from Costa Rica. In contrast to its more common relative, it lacks <b>reddish</b> color in its stipe scabers and has a black cap, although it has a similar yellow stipe base.|$|E
5|$|Mycenastrum corium subsp. ferrugineum {{has a deep}} rusty red to <b>reddish</b> orange gleba, clearly {{distinguishing}} it {{from the}} glebal coloring of the main subspecies. M.corium var. diabolicum has an extremely spiny capillitium.|$|E
5|$|Neptune has a {{planetary}} ring system, though one much less substantial {{than that of}} Saturn. The rings may consist of ice particles coated with silicates or carbon-based material, which most likely gives them a <b>reddish</b> hue.|$|E
5|$|Sandstones and coals of the Llewellyn Formation {{are located}} in the {{watershed}} of Eddy Creek. Some drift is located near the creek and <b>reddish</b> shale and sandstone of the Catskill Formation can be seen in this area.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the {{spore print}} is brownish, with pink, <b>reddish,</b> or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The hymenium of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows <b>reddish</b> globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the hymenium, and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The {{flesh of}} the {{mushroom}} is smooth, thin and white. The taste and odor are mild and have no distinct smell. When treated with a dilute solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or sulfuric acid, the flesh turns <b>reddish.</b> The spore print of H.olivaceoalbus is white.|$|E
5|$|The {{likewise}} {{very common}} Lactarius deliciosus {{is similar in}} appearance. Lactarius deterrimus differs basically from the first because its flesh becomes <b>reddish</b> within 10minutes and in about 30minutes dark maroon, caused by the discolouration of the milk. The milk of L.deterrimus stays orange or becomes <b>reddish</b> within 30minutes. Also, the milk of the latter tastes mild, while the milk of the first distinctly bitter. The cap of L.deterrimus changes its colour in old age or if injured distinctly greenish and is common only under spruces, while L.deterrimus is native under pines.|$|E
5|$|The red-cracked bolete (Xerocomellus chrysenteron) has an olive-brown {{cap that}} cracks, exposing flesh that ages to pinkish red. Boletellus chrysenteroides, {{found only in}} eastern North America, has a velvety to smooth, dark <b>reddish</b> brown, cracked cap with pale exposed flesh.|$|E
5|$|The variety R.botrytis var. aurantiiramosa is {{distinguished}} from the more common variety by the orange color of the upper branches. Variety compactospora tends to show a more pronounced wine-red, purple, or <b>reddish</b> color in the branch tips, and has smaller spores measuring 9.2–12.8 by 4–5.4µm.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{somewhat}} <b>reddish</b> Pluto and Triton, Eris appears almost white. Pluto's <b>reddish</b> color {{is thought to}} be due to deposits of tholins on its surface, and where these deposits darken the surface, the lower albedo leads to higher temperatures and the evaporation of methane deposits. In contrast, Eris is far enough from the Sun that methane can condense onto its surface even where the albedo is low. The condensation of methane uniformly over the surface reduces any albedo contrasts and would cover up any deposits of red tholins.|$|E
5|$|A {{danger to}} {{agriculture}} is wheat rust, a pathogenic fungus causing <b>reddish</b> patches, coloured by its spores. A virulent {{form of the}} wheat disease, stem rust, strain Ug99, spread from Africa across to the Arabian Peninsula by 2007. In field trials in Kenya, more than 85% of wheat samples, including major cultivars, were susceptible, implying that higher crop diversity was required. The Nobel laureate Norman Borlaug argued for action to ensure global food security.|$|E
5|$|A.coccinea {{closely resembles}} A.arachnoidea, {{but may be}} {{distinguished}} from the latter by its bright red arms, and its larger spores (4–5 by 2.5–3μm in A.coccinea compared with 2.5–3.5 by 1.5μm in A.arachnoidea). A.arachnoidea is known from Asia and West Africa. A.rubra is a relatively common pantropical species, and differs from A.coccinea in its <b>reddish</b> receptacle (compared with pink to cream-colored in A.coccinea) and bifurcating arms that are typically multichambered.|$|E
5|$|After its {{discovery}} in 1897, {{it has never}} been recorded again and it is now considered extinct; the presence of introduced black rats on María Madre may have contributed to its extinction. Oryzomys nelsoni was a large species, distinguished in particular by its long tail, robust skull, and large incisors. It was <b>reddish</b> to yellowish above and mostly white below. Its diet may have included plant material and small animals.|$|E
5|$|Akodon caenosus is the {{smallest}} of the Argentine members of the A.boliviensis group–indeed, among {{the smallest}} of all species of Akodon. The upperparts are uniformly colored, but their tone is variable: generally ochraceous brown, but approaching yellow, red, or olivaceous in some individuals. <b>Reddish</b> tones occur mostly in lactating females. High-altitude animals are generally lighter, but there is also conspicuous variation within populations. The ears are similar to the upperparts, but some individuals have the sides more rich and clear in color. The underparts are clearly different in color, varying from light gray to yellowish or <b>reddish.</b> There are yellowish rings around the eyes, which are more highly developed in high-altitude populations. There are white to yellowish hairs on the fore- and hindfeet. The tail is variably covered with hair and is dark brown above and white to buffy below.|$|E
5|$|Chinese astronomical records {{report that}} in 365 BC, Gan De {{detected}} {{what appears to}} have been a moon of Jupiter, probably Ganymede, with the naked eye. However, Gan De reported the color of the companion as <b>reddish,</b> which is puzzling since the moons are too faint for their color to be perceived with the naked eye. Shi Shen and Gan De together made fairly accurate observations of the five major planets.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{is one of}} a few {{metallic}} elements with {{a natural}} color other than gray or silver. Pure copper is orange-red and acquires a <b>reddish</b> tarnish when exposed to air. The characteristic color of copper results from the electronic transitions between the filled 3d and half-empty 4s atomic shells – the energy difference between these shells corresponds to orange light.|$|E
5|$|During this process, fungal spores {{germinate}} in the boreholes, {{a reaction}} {{caused by the}} dryness of the tree, creating an appropriate environment and an entry for air. The fungus breaks down the lignin, causing white rot. It moves towards the vertically aligned xylem. The vertical profile shows <b>reddish</b> and white streaks which run {{in the direction of}} growth.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam, confiscated pygmy lorises {{are usually}} {{taken to the}} Endangered Primate Rescue Centre in Cúc Phương National Park, to be reintroduced into the wild. Non-experts may find it {{difficult}} to distinguish between the pygmy slow loris and the Sunda slow loris, as both have similarly <b>reddish</b> fur, which is variable in colors. In international shipments, pygmy lorises may be even mixed up with pottos or lemurs.|$|E
5|$|In {{the area}} around Green Lake there are forests of pecan, black willow, cedar, American elm, {{hackberry}} and green ash. To the south, the Guadalupe Delta Wildlife Management Area serves as a wetland habitat for thousands of permanent egrets, and other birds, including the brown pelican, <b>reddish</b> egret, white-faced ibis, wood stork, bald eagle, white-tailed hawk, peregrine falcon, and the whooping crane. American alligators reside in the area as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1900s, Eddy Creek lacked culm {{deposits}} at its mouth. However, its water was colored yellow by sulfur at that location. Further upstream, two pipes discharged mine {{water into the}} creek. One of these pipes had <b>reddish</b> water. However, upstream of an ash dump on the creek, the water was clear.|$|E
5|$|Medium in {{size for}} its genus, {{it was first}} {{described}} as a separate species, but later lumped into other, widespread species until it was reinstated as separate in 2009. It is distinctive in fur color—grayish brown on the forequarters and <b>reddish</b> brown on the hindquarters—and in some dimensions of its skull, with a high braincase, robust zygomatic arches (cheekbones), and long incisive foramina (perforations of the palate between the incisors and the molars).|$|E
5|$|Myrrh is a bitter-tasting, aromatic, {{yellow to}} <b>reddish</b> brown gum. It is {{obtained}} from small thorny flowering {{trees of the}} Commiphora genus, which {{is a part of}} the incense-tree family (Latin: Burseraceae). There are two main varieties of myrrh: bisabol and herabol. Bisabol is produced by C. erythraea, an Arabian species similar to the C. myrrha, which produces the herabol myrrh. C. myrrha grows in Ethiopia, Arabia, and Somalia.|$|E
5|$|Nikolai Zarudny and Härms {{described}} a subspecies, rubripersonatus, from Baluchistan in 1902. This was {{described a}}s having a deeper <b>reddish</b> orange skin {{on the head and}} a yellow-tipped dark bill. This has rarely been considered a valid subspecies but the intermediate pattern of bill colouration suggests intermixing of subspecies.|$|E
5|$|Ninox boobook halmaturina {{is found}} on Kangaroo Island. It was {{described}} by Australian amateur ornithologist Gregory Mathews in 1912 {{on the basis of}} darker and more <b>reddish</b> plumage than other subspecies. It is sometimes included in the nominate subspecies. It has dark brown underparts with reddish-brown rather than white markings. Some individuals of subspecies boobook from the mainland do have similar coloration, but are consistently larger.|$|E
5|$|Onneca {{was thus}} the {{paternal}} grandmother of Abd-ar-Rahman III, who {{inherited from her}} {{as well as from}} his mother Muzna hailing from the Pyrenees (probably a Basque) European facial features such as blue eyes and light <b>reddish</b> hair that he attempted to alter (notably through hair coloring) in order to look more typically Arab.|$|E
5|$|The {{color pattern}} varies geographically. The head has two well-marked dark bands: {{one on the}} crown and the other between the eyes. On {{the sides of the}} head, there are two oblique dark bands or bars that run from the eye to the supralabials. Below, the head is {{yellowish}} white with scattered dark blotches. Iris color ranges from gold to silver-gray. Dorsally, the ground-color varies from straw yellow, to light brown, to orange or <b>reddish</b> brown. This is overlaid with a pattern of 18–22 backwardly-directed, dark brown to black bands that extend down the back and tail. Usually these bands are roughly chevron-shaped, but may be more U-shaped in some areas. They also form 2–6 light and dark cross-bands on the tail. Some populations are heavily flecked with brown and black, often obscuring other coloration, giving the animal a dusty-brown or blackish appearance. The belly is yellow or white, with a few scattered dark spots. Newborn young have golden head markings with pinkish to <b>reddish</b> ventral plates toward the lateral edges.|$|E
5|$|The oldest beds of this {{formation}} {{belong to}} the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a <b>reddish,</b> slope-forming rock layer with thin beds of siltstone that are interbedded with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.|$|E
5|$|The {{only other}} Phallus species known with a pinkish-colored cap is P.rubicundus; its conical cap has a surface that is wrinkled, not reticulate. Other similar species include P.hadriani, {{which has a}} purple volva, P.macrosporus, which has a <b>reddish</b> volva, and P.formanosus, which has a pale pink stipe and volva.|$|E
5|$|The ornatus {{morphotype}} is most reliably {{distinguished by}} its longer fur, averaging 26.8mm compared to 22.4mm in javanicus. Other distinguishing characteristics include overall color (generally light brown in ornatus compared with brown to <b>reddish</b> in javanicus), {{and amount of}} brown coloring in the fur (ornatus has less brown than javanicus, resulting in a lighter-colored ventral region).|$|E
