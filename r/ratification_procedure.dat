50|$|The first {{generation}} of recognition conventions was developed {{under the auspices of}} UNESCO in the 1970s and 1980s, with conventions covering Latin America and the Caribbean (1974), the Mediterranean (1976), the Arab States (1978), Europe (1979), Africa (1981), and Asia and the Pacific (1983). These conventions are specifically concerned with recognition of qualifications rather than equivalence - there is no attempt to build frameworks with automatic equivalence of qualifications. This {{first generation}} of conventions has been built on by second generation conventions, starting with Lisbon (1997) covering Europe and now including the Asia-Pacific region (Tokyo, 2011) and Africa (Addis Ababa, 2014). A major change with the more recent conventions is a shift in favour of recognition, with the burden being to show substantial differences.

40|$|Because of {{its limited}} competences, the EU often concludes trade and {{investment}} agreements in the “mixed” form, which implies long and uncertain <b>ratification</b> <b>procedures.</b> This paper suggests that the Union may bypass {{some of the problems}} created by “mixed” procedures by giving provisional application to {{trade and investment}} agreements. The analysis demonstrates that a provisionally applied agreement produces legal effects, and may therefore ensure a certain degree of legal certainty. Secondly, it is submitted that the provisional application of EU trade and investment agreements covers a large part of their substantive scope. Finally, it is contended that provisional application ensures a rather stable legal framework, because only the Union (and not its Member States) can decide to terminate it. Provisional application thus appears as a pragmatic instrument, that enables the Union to swiftly bring trade and investment agreements into application, and consequently enhances the effectiveness of the EU’s external policy...|$|R
50|$|During the German <b>ratification</b> <b>procedure,</b> the {{constitutionality}} of the treaty was challenged. On 30 June 2009, the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany issued an opinion regarding the treaty. The opinion stated that the Treaty was compatible with Germany's Basic Law. In addition, the opinion elaborated on the interpretation of the intergovernmental treaties underlying the European Union. The 147-page ruling focused on the structure of the European Union that will be established after the Lisbon Treaty goes effective and its relationship with the Basic Law. The opinion concludes that the Treaty does not create a European federal state (which would invalidate the Basic Law and require a referendum in Germany), that the structural democratic deficit of the EU institutions cannot be resolved in an association of sovereign national states (since it would break the principle of the equality of states), and that the substance of German national sovereignty is protected. While the Court considered the Treaty (and the German statute incorporating it into German Law and authorising the Treaty's ratification) compatible with the German Basic Law, it also found that an accompanying statute, that dealt with the German Parliament's powers of oversight over the votes cast by the representatives of the German Government within the EU's institutions granted insufficient powers to the German Parliament, in a manner incompatible with the Basic Law, so that Germany's ratification of the Treaty was to be stayed until the statute in question was amended so as to include provision recognising that in certain cases the German representative was only to cast a vote once the authorisation of the German Parliament was obtained. In addition, the judges reserved the right to overrule judgments by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) within Germany, if they should be judged in violation of the Basic Law. In accordance with the ruling, the German Parliament passed a bill amending the statute that dealt with the German Parliament's powers of oversight, and, once the increased control of the German Parliament over the actions of Germany's representatives was enshrined into law, the German President proceeded with the signing of the instrument of ratification.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{illustrate}} various pitfalls which must be dealt with before an international agreement may begin to function, ie before it creates a legal obligation upon a contracting state. The Czech Republic is, according to the authors, an appropriate example to illustrate this, for various reasons, as it is an EU Member State with a (prevailing) parliamentary form of governance and a (rather complex) bicameral parliament. In the first place, the authors deal with the historical and comparative context of the <b>ratification</b> <b>procedure</b> of international agreements in the Czech Republic. Since this procedure in every country involves the interplay of several bodies, a proper evaluation of the historical context may help in the interpretation of constitutional regulation, which is rather brief in the Czech Republic. One of the main questions of the <b>ratification</b> <b>procedure,</b> which the authors address, is the role of the president of the Czech Republic in the procedure of the ratification of international agreements. On the basis of the historical and the current constitutional regulation, the authors conclude that the competence of the president related to international agreements cannot be considered to be his/her prerogative. The president’s act of ratification is, according to the authors, the formal conclusion of an internal consultation procedure on an international agreement in the Czech Republic. In exercising this competence, the president is endowed with a very limited margin of discretion. The authors furthermore make a comparative study based on a questionnaire circulated via the European Centre for Parliamentary Research and Documentation on the role of the government, parliament and the head of state in the <b>ratification</b> <b>procedure</b> of international treaties. The main part of the article deals with selected problems and possible solutions of the negotiation procedure of international agreements and the practice of application (namely the provisional application of international treaties, the classification of international treaties, repeated submissions of the proposal on the expression of consent with the ratification of an international treaty by chambers of parliament, simplified parliamentary approval for the ratification of presidential treaties, and the concept of ratification). The article ends with brief observations regarding international treaties concluded by the European Union or the Union together with the Member States, the significance of which will probably continue to increase...|$|E

All member states except of Ireland where a referendum is legally required decided to ratify the Treaty of Lisbon via the parliamentary procedure only – even if it is widely asserted that the new treaty contains crucial elements of the TEC.

40|$|On the {{strategic}} use of representative democracy in international agreements∗ We consider as endogenous {{the choice of}} the delegation ’ rule in a political integration process be-tween two countries. We study three potential types of delegation: strong, weak or no delegation, this last case corresponding to a referendum. We show that populations decide to bind them-selves by delegating the national policy decision to a "powerfull conservative representative", in order to improve their bargaining position. These non-cooperative behaviors of countries when they decide on their delegation rule induce negative political externalities between countries, which cancel the gains achieved by the internalization of economic externalities in the case of political integration. We then propose two extensions. First, we assume a pre-play game where the countries choose whether or not to initiate political integration. Secondly, we examine the consequences of ratification by referendum. We conclude that a Pareto improvement of the political integration process would be to specify within the international treaty itself the means for its ratification; more precisely, to incorporate a formal <b>ratification</b> <b>procedure,</b> corresponding to an ex post referendum...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the development}} of the constitutional process in Israel since 1950, and especially since the 1992 basic laws. It argues that this process should be viewed within a frameworks distinguishing between three stages of constitution-making: the initial enactment of a constitution, amendments of the constitution, and application and interpretation of the constitution. The distinction between stages has institutional implications. Constitution-making should be primarily done by constituent assemblies. Regular legislatures are a second choice. The process should seek broad consensus, and involve big compromises between segments of the public. Amendments should also be undertaken by legislatures with broad consensus, but they can be more local, and their <b>ratification</b> <b>procedures</b> may be less demanding. Application and interpretation should be done in an ongoing way by all branches of government. Courts are authoritative interpreters but they do not necessarily have the final word on the constitution. When we study the Israeli process we see that does not conform to this model at all. It reflects judicial involvement in all stages, including the initial making of the constitution. There is thus a 'legitimacy deficit' in the constitutional process, which may perpetuate the current instability in the constitutional situation. ...|$|R
