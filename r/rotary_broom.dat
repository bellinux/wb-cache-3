50|$|For {{personal}} reasons, Drumm {{would let}} go of Marysville <b>Rotary</b> <b>Broom</b> Service, Inc., eventually being bought out in 1985 by Dick Savage. Kennedy Brush, Savage's other industrial broom manufacturing company, and Marysville <b>Rotary</b> <b>Broom</b> Service, Inc. would merge in 1990 to form United Rotary Brush.|$|E
50|$|The ODV {{comes in}} four general models, the G-18, G-30, G-60 and G-90. Each vehicle can be fitted with {{attachments}} that convert the ODV into a tow bar tractor, a towbarless tractor (the ODAT), snow plow, or <b>rotary</b> <b>broom.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1964, Drumm started Marysville <b>Rotary</b> <b>Broom</b> Service, Inc. in {{his machine}} shop, {{which was on}} the {{property}} of his home and farm. He would sell locally and regionally through [...] "word of mouth." [...] In the late 1960s he would develop a machine which made the manufacturing of wafer brooms cheaper and faster through a mechanical process, versus the old manual process. [...] This gave the business an advantage, and production increased dramatically.|$|E
50|$|Grasshopper offers dozer blades, <b>rotary</b> <b>brooms</b> and snowthrowers {{for snow}} removal {{in the winter}} months.|$|R
5000|$|Elec-trak branded {{attachments}} included electric trimmers, edgers, chainsaws, radios, arc welders, fork lifts, front-end loaders, <b>rotary</b> <b>brooms,</b> roller aerators, lawn rollers, dump carts, large vacuums, agricultural sprayers, moldboard plows, {{row crop}} cultivators, tillers, disk harrows, sickle bar mowers, belly mowers, front-mounted rotary mowers, front or rear-mounted ganged reel mowers, lawn sweepers, electric rakes, snowblowers, snowplows, golf bag holders, double seats, 120vac rotary inverters, canopy tops, and more. [...] Most of these attachments were {{connected by a}} 36VDC [...] "power take off" [...] using a NEMA 10-50 outlet, usually used in the U.S. for 240VAC clothes dryers and thus compatible with readily available cords {{in most of the}} USA.|$|R
50|$|A compact utility tractor (CUT) is {{a smaller}} {{version of an}} {{agricultural}} tractor, but designed primarily for landscaping and estate management tasks rather than for planting and harvesting on a commercial scale. Typical CUTs range from 20 to 50 horsepower (15-37 kW) with available power take-off (PTO) horsepower ranging from 15 to 45 hp (11-34 kW). CUTs are often equipped with both a mid-mounted and a standard rear PTO, especially those below 40 horsepower (30 kW). The mid-mount PTO shaft typically rotates at/near 2000 rpm and is typically used to power mid-mount finish mowers, front-mounted snow blowers or front-mounted <b>rotary</b> <b>brooms.</b> The rear PTO is standardized at 540 rpms for the North American markets, but {{in some parts of}} the world, a dual 540/1000 rpm PTO is standard, and implements are available for either standard in those markets.|$|R
50|$|By the 1970s, {{the company}} had become a notable player in the industry, selling nationally and worldwide. Drumm would obtain several more U.S. patents {{in the years to}} come, which {{included}} intellectual property for core mounting assemblies, sweeper brushes, <b>rotary</b> <b>broom</b> core assemblages, spiral brushes, and brush bristle units. The machine shop Drumm had started in eventually would be transformed into a modern factory through additions and new construction during this period.The company reached its pinnacle under Drumm by the mid-1980s. It was attracting attention from all over with various interests, including being featured on the local Columbus WBNS-TV evening news in a story about Reaganomics and the successful impact it was having locally on the economy with businesses.|$|E
5000|$|Shortly {{after he}} sold Marysville <b>Rotary</b> <b>Broom</b> Service, Inc., Drumm would {{start a new}} company, Drumm Industries, where he would {{manufacture}} push brooms {{for a short period}} until a no-compete contract would expire. In 1988 he would receive a patent for a push broom head of the channel-mounted bristle type. He would then focus a considerable amount of time innovating a replaceable strip brush. This changed the whole process of manufacturing tube-brooms, as one tube could be recycled simply by replacing the brush through replaceable slide-on strips, versus the old method of wrapping the brush around the tube, welding it together, and shipping the tube back for a replacement wrap when it was worn out, or scrapping the tube altogether. Drumm would obtain several patents relating to the strip brush innovation.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{dispersed}} {{nature of}} forestry operations {{in much of}} the world, only a subset of a given forest road network are used in any year. Specifically, spur roads are generally only used when harvesting operations are adjacent to roadways; otherwise, they remain unused or only have infrequent administrative traffic. During these periods of light use, a substantial amount of organic litter may build up on the roads. As this detritus accumulates and decays, it creates conditions that encourage the growth of unwanted vegetation in the roadway, accelerating the contamination of the surface aggregate. This organic material can degrade the road by retaining moisture and creating a less tractive road surface. Contemporary forest practices control this unwanted vegetation by using a combination of grading or herbicides, at significant expense. One potential alternative treatment is the utilization of a rotary-mounted asphalt broom for vegetation and debris removal. A series of field trials were performed on wet, contaminated forest roads, in which we evaluated vegetation, debris removal effectiveness, and tire slip on segments of road before and after sweeping. The combined effects of wire and synthetic bristles on the <b>rotary</b> <b>broom</b> proved effective in both increasing traction and removing unwanted debris and vegetation from the road surface. Application of this technique was expedient, and did not result in significant loss of surface aggregate, removing on average less than 1 % of the aggregate surface...|$|E
