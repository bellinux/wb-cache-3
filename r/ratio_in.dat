Results revealed that the concentrations of phosphorus, sodium, copper and iron in soil solution were not significantly altered, while rest of the nutrient-elements significantly changed due to applied Ca/B <b>ratios</b> <b>in</b> soil. Results also indicate that almost all nutrient-elements correlated to Ca/B <b>ratios</b> <b>in</b> soil solution as well as in applied terms, though with a variable statistical significance. For example, phosphorus, iron, boron and molybdenum showed negative and rest of the nutrient-elements such as nitrogen (NH 4 +NO 3), potassium, calcium, magnesium, sodium, zinc, manganese and copper showed positive correlation. Moreover, Soil pH showed a significantly negative correlation to Ca/B <b>ratios</b> <b>in</b> soil solution. The present study suggests that both Ca/B <b>ratios</b> either <b>in</b> soil solution or in applied terms are significant, in determining the nutrients response in soil-plant system and linking the plant nutrition to soil fertility...|$|R

This area centralis {{has a high}} rod-to-cone cell <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> many diurnal species studied thus far, whereas diurnal anthropoids have no rod cells in their fovea. Once again, this suggests lower visual acuity in lemurs than in anthropoids. Furthermore, the rod-to-cone cell ratio can be variable even among diurnal species. For instance, Verreaux's sifaka (Propithecus verreauxi) and the indri (Indri indri) {{have only a few}} large cones scattered along their predominantly rod-dominated retina. The eyes of the ring-tailed lemur contain one cone to five rods. Nocturnal lemurs such as mouse lemurs and dwarf lemurs, on the other hand, have retinas made up entirely of rod cells.|$|E

The number of school boards in the province had been reduced in 2004, from 10 boards to five. Since that time student enrolment in Newfoundland and Labrador had declined by 14,000, or 17 per cent. The government faced criticism for the amalgamation from people in the education system but despite this Minister Clyde Jackman announced {{the appointment of a}} transition team for the amalgamation on April 24, 2013, with a plan to have the new school board in place for September of that year. The budget also saw reductions in the Department of Education that would affect areas such as administration, learning resources support and district-based numeracy supports. However, the minister said there would be no reduction in the allocation of regular classroom teachers, and Jackman stated that Newfoundland and Labrador had the best student-teacher <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> the country.|$|E
5|$|Calvin {{also wrote}} many letters and treatises. Following the Responsio ad Sadoletum, Calvin wrote {{an open letter}} {{at the request of}} Bucer to Charles V in 1543, Supplex exhortatio ad Caesarem, {{defending}} the reformed faith. This was followed by an open letter to the pope (Admonitio paterna Pauli III) in 1544, in which Calvin admonished Paul III for depriving the reformers of any prospect of rapprochement. The pope proceeded to open the Council of Trent, which resulted in decrees against the reformers. Calvin refuted the decrees by producing the Acta synodi Tridentinae cum Antidoto in 1547. When Charles tried to find a compromise solution with the Augsburg Interim, Bucer and Bullinger urged Calvin to respond. He wrote the treatise, Vera Christianae pacificationis et Ecclesiae reformandae <b>ratio</b> <b>in</b> 1549, in which he described the doctrines that should be upheld, including justification by faith.|$|E

We analyse patterns of allocation to males versus females, as well as allocation to growth versus reproduction for slave-making ants in the tribe Formicoxenini.
