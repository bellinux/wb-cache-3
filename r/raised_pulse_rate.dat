40|$|AbstractIntroductiona Meckel’s {{diverticulum}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common congenital anomalies of the digestive tract. The reported lifetime complication rate is 4 %, mostly due to hemorrhage, obstruction, perforation or inflammation. A symptomatic Meckel’s diverticulum due to rupture after blunt abdominal trauma is very rare. We believe this case report is the first reporting a rupture of a Meckel’s diverticulum after a low velocity blunt abdominal trauma and outlining the importance of a thorough and complete examination of the patient after blunt abdominal trauma. Presentation of casea 17 -year-old male presented with abdominal pain after blunt abdominal trauma during a soccer game. Physical examination showed signs of peritonitis in all quadrants of the abdomen. During admission the patient deteriorated with decreasing blood pressure and <b>raising</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate.</b> A CT-scan showed free abdominal fluid. Our patient was scheduled for an emergent laparotomy where a perforated Meckel’s diverticulum with fecal spill was found. A segmental ileal resection was performed. Post-operative, patient developed a pneumonia and also intra-abdominal abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage. After an admission period of 17 -days the patient was discharged. Conclusionperforation of a Meckel’s diverticulum is rarely suspected as a cause of acute deterioration following blunt abdominal trauma. This case shows the importance of awareness of this kind of injury especially in male patients...|$|R
40|$|With the {{availability}} of orally active angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, it has become possible to chronically inhibit the renin-angiotensin system. When given to hypertensive patients as monotherapy, these agents can normalize the blood pressure in about 50 % of all cases like other antihypertensive drugs. If the monotherapy {{is not sufficient to}} normalize blood pressure, the addition of a sodium depletion, for instance by administering concomitantly a diuretic, can become necessary to normalize blood pressure. The antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors is characterized by some particularly favorable features: ACE inhibitors attenuate the fall in serum potassium and the rise in plasma uric acid induced by diuretics, they do not cause any salt retention nor orthostatic hypotension, they do not <b>raise</b> <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> when they reduce blood pressure, and they certainly do not reduce the perfusion rate of the brain, the heart or the kidneys. The same features are apparent when using these agents in patients with congestive heart failure, in whom these drugs enhance cardiac output and exercise capacity by decreasing simultaneously pre- and afterload to the heart. Untoward effects of ACE inhibitors are relatively infrequent and they can mostly be foreseen based on an understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms of these compounds. Thus, with appropriate use, untoward effects are often completely avoided. Recent clinical studies have suggested that ACE inhibitors, when compared to other antihypertensive drugs, can improve the quality of life. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

However, its association with lipid metabolic dysfunctions remains unclear, especially resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> as an indicator for identifying the risk of lipid metabolic dysfunctions. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the association between resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and lipid metabolic dysfunctions, and then evaluate the feasibility of resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> as an indicator for screening the risk of lipid metabolic dysfunctions. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was performed, and 16, 926 subjects were included in this study from rural community residents aged 35 - 78 years. Resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and relevant covariates were collected from a standard questionnaire. The fasting blood samples were collected and measured for lipid profile. Predictive performance was analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and TC (r = 0. 102, P = 0. 001), TG (r = 0. 182, P = 0. 001), and dyslipidemia (r = 0. 037, P = 0. 008). In the multivariate models, the adjusted odds ratios for hypercholesterolemia (from 1. 07 to 1. 15), hypertriglyceridemia (1. 11 to 1. 16), low HDL hypercholesterolemia (1. 03 to 1. 06), high LDL hypercholesterolemia (0. 92 to 1. 14), and dyslipidemia (1. 04 to 1. 07) were positively increased across quartiles of resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> (P for trend < 0. 05). The ROC curve indicated that resting <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> had low sensitivity (78. 95 %, 74. 18 %, 51. 54 %, 44. 39 %, and 54. 22 %), specificity (55. 88 %, 59. 46 %, 57. 27 %, 65. 02 %, and 60. 56 %), and the area under ROC curve (0. 70, 0. 69, 0. 54, 0. 56, and 0. 58) for identifying the risk of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL hypercholesterolemia, high LDL hypercholesterolemia, and dyslipidemia, respectively.

40|$|The Holmium:YAG laser (λ = 2120 nm) is {{currently}} the preferred laser for fragmenting kidney stones in the clinic. However, this laser has some limitations, including operation at low <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> and a multimode spatial beam profile which prohibits its use with smaller, more flexible optical fibers. Our laboratory is studying the Thulium fiber laser (λ = 1908 nm) as an alternative lithotripter. The TFL has several advantages, including lower stone ablation thresholds, use with smaller and more flexible fibers, and operation at arbitrary pulse lengths and <b>pulse</b> <b>rates.</b> Previous studies have reported increased stone ablation rates with TFL operation at higher <b>pulse</b> <b>rates,</b> however, stone retropulsion remains an obstacle to even more efficient stone ablation. This study explores TFL operation at high <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> in combination with a stone stabilization device (e. g. stone basket) for improved efficiency. A TFL beam with pulse energy of 35 mJ, pulse duration of 500 -μs, and <b>pulse</b> <b>rates</b> of 10 - 500 Hz was coupled into 100 -μm-core, low-OH, silica fibers, in contact mode with uric acid and calcium oxalate monohydrate stones, ex vivo.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In children, sleep-related airway {{obstruction}} {{by large}} tonsils and adenoids can cause {{obstructive sleep apnea}} (OSA). OSA may lead to poor growth, developmental delay, behaviour or learning problems. Recent evidence also suggests that children with OSA may develop cardiovascular complications, the mechanisms perhaps involving hypoxemia, the autonomic nervous system, apneas, and arousals. Surgical removal of tonsils and adenoids (adenotonsillectomy (T&A)) usually cures pediatric OSA. To diagnose OSA {{at all levels of}} severity, polysomnography is currently the best approach. The McGill Oximetry Score (MOS) is a validated measure based on nocturnal pulse oximetry. An abnormal MOS has a 97 % positive predictive value at detecting moderate-severe OSA. Because the MOS was devised by measuring frequency of desaturations (< 90 %) and numbers of clusters of desaturations, it is not accurate at detecting OSA in children who do not have such drops in oxygen saturation. Accordingly, other measures applicable to a wider spectrum of children should be assessed. These measures should be simpler, less cumbersome, cheaper, and more accessible than polysomnography. OBJECTIVES: To study alternative approaches that may be used to identify moderate-severe OSA in children, two studies were conducted. We examined one subjective measure - the OSA- 18 parent questionnaire - and two objective measures - <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability. For the OSA- 18 study, the goal was to determine whether it would accurately detect children with moderate-severe OSA as indicated by an abnormal MOS. For the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability study, the goal was to determine if either or both would decrease after treatment with T&A for children with moderate-severe OSA. METHODS: For the OSA- 18 study, we used a cross-sectional design that included children 1 - 18 years old referred to a pediatric sleep laboratory for evaluation of suspected OSA. Alongside data from the OSA- 18, we analyzed demographic and medical data (from a parent questionnaire) and information regarding adenotonsillar hypertrophy. We estimated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values as well as receiver operating curves of the OSA- 18 in detecting an abnormal MOS. We also conducted univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, using the MOS as the dependent variable and the OSA- 18 score and others (age, gender, comorbidities, race) as independent variables. For the second study, we used a retrospective before-after design to compare <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability as measured by nocturnal pulse oximetry pre- and post-T&A of otherwise healthy children 1 - 18 years old with moderate-to-severe OSA. RESULTS: For the OSA- 18 study, we studied 334 children (58 % male, mean age 4. 6 +/- 2. 2 years). The OSA- 18 had a sensitivity of 40 % and a negative predictive value of 73 % for detecting an abnormal MOS. In addition, the area under the receiver operating curve was 0. 611. While controlling for other independent variables in the logistic regression model, for each unit increase in the OSA- 18 Score, the odds of having an abnormal MOS were increased by 2 %. However, for each increase in age of 1 year, the odds of having an abnormal MOS were decreased by 17 %. In the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability study, 25 subjects (88 % male; mean age 4. 3 +/- 3. 6 years) were enrolled. Following T&A, <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability decreased in 21 of 25 and 23 of 25 children, respectively. Mean <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> dropped from 99. 7 +/- 11. 2 to 90. 1 +/- 10. 7 bpm, p< 0. 001; age-standardized <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> (z-score) from 0. 8 (0. 4, 1. 5) to 0. 4 (0, 0. 9), p= 0. 04). <b>Pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability, as measured by the standard deviation of the <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> decreased from 10. 3 +/- 2. 1 to 8. 2 +/- 1. 6 bpm, p< 0. 001. As well, OSA symptomatology, parental concern about breathing during sleep and the MOS all improved. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the first study we conclude that among children referred to a sleep laboratory, the OSA- 18 does not accurately detect which children will have an abnormal MOS. The OSA- 18 should not be used in place of objective testing to identify moderate-severe OSA in children. However, from the second study we conclude that measures of the autonomic nervous system such as <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability, as measured by pulse oximetry, decreased following surgical treatment of moderate-severe OSA. The results of this study potentially serve as important data for further work that would determine the accuracy of <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> and <b>pulse</b> <b>rate</b> variability measures and their diagnostic usefulness for OSA at all levels of severity...|$|R
