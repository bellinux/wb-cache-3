5|$|Arkham Origins {{is an open}} world action-adventure game {{incorporating}} stealth game tactics. Batman can use his cape {{to glide}} around Gotham City and the grapnel gun's <b>retracting</b> <b>rope</b> to attach to hard-to-reach ledges and extend his flight. Some gadgets from previous Arkham games are present {{at the start of}} Arkham Origins, while others become available during play. Returning gadgets include the Cryptographic Sequencer, used to hack security consoles; the Batclaw, used for hooking onto surfaces; the Batarang, a throwing weapon; the Remote Batarang, its remote-controlled counterpart; Explosive Gel, used to destroy weak surfaces and knock down enemies; Smoke Pellets, used for stealthy exits and entrances; the Disruptor, which can remotely disable guns and explosive mines, and the Grapnel Accelerator, an earlier version of the Grapnel Boost. New equipment in Batman's arsenal include the Remote Claw; this allows Batman to target two objects and pull them together, allowing him to throw enemies into each other or hit them with objects (tethering two walled points creates a tightrope for Batman to cross); Shock Gloves, which allow Batman to block electric attacks, disable some enemies and stun shielded ones, and short-circuit objects, and the Concussion Detonator, capable of stunning large enemy groups.|$|E
500|$|Batman: Arkham City is an open-world action-adventure {{game that}} {{incorporates}} tactics from stealth games. It is presented from the third-person perspective, showing the playable character on screen {{and allowing the}} camera to be freely rotated around it. The game is set within Arkham City, which {{is open to the}} player {{from the beginning of the}} game, allowing them to travel freely anywhere within its boundaries. The player can move silently throughout the game, using a combination of gadgets and stealth moves to sneak up on enemies and incapacitate them. Batman can use his cape to glide around the city, diving downwards and swooping upwards to extend his flight, and he can use the grapnel gun's <b>retracting</b> <b>rope</b> to attach to out-of-reach ledges. As Batman, the player is able to use [...] "Detective Vision", a visual mode that highlights elements of interest on-screen, such as character status, collectables, and clues; the mode is also used to perform forensic activities such as tracking the source of a sniper rifle round. The player has access to an in-game criminal database which includes forensic puzzles, as well as a network for hacking communication frequencies.|$|E

50|$|All bungee Trampolines {{operate under}} the same principle. The {{participant}} puts on a bungee trampoline harness according to their waist size, and depending on the person's weight they hooked to the relative number of bungee ropes. Those ropes connect to a climbing rope which goes through a pulley system connected to the highest point on the jump structure and after connecting to an electric winch or manual winch. As the participant gains momentum, the operator puts more tension on the bungee ropes by using the hand controller to re-coil the winch and <b>retract</b> the <b>rope,</b> allowing the participant to reach heights {{as high as the}} structure or higher and do flips and other maneuvers that would otherwise be impossible on a regular trampoline for untrained people. There are hydraulic models along with winch models depending on the age and manufacturer of the unit.|$|R
50|$|An {{understanding}} of belt friction {{is essential for}} sailing crews and mountain climbers. Their professions require being {{able to understand the}} amount of weight a rope with a certain tension capacity can hold versus the amount of wraps around a pulley. Too many revolutions around a pulley make it inefficient to <b>retract</b> or release <b>rope,</b> and too few may cause the rope to slip. Misjudging the ability of a rope and capstan system to maintain the proper frictional forces may lead to failure and injury.|$|R
50|$|Daniel and Jessica {{decide to}} dig up a {{valuable}} bonsai tree that Miyagi brought from Okinawa and planted halfway down a cliff {{with the hope of}} selling it and using the money to replace the other stolen trees. As they retrieve it, Barnes and his men appear and <b>retract</b> their climbing <b>ropes,</b> leaving Daniel no choice but to sign up for the tournament. They get pulled back up, but Barnes breaks the valuable tree. Daniel returns to the shop with Miyagi's damaged bonsai, which Miyagi attempts to mend. Miyagi tells Daniel both that he has sold his truck to buy a new stock of trees and that now he cannot train Daniel for the tournament.|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} Imperial age Roman unroofed theatres were endowed with velaria. Velaria were awnings made of sailcloth, in either canvas, linen or cotton, {{attached}} to spokes of rope {{that could be}} extended or <b>retracted</b> with <b>ropes</b> and pulleys over the cavea. Their main purpose was to provide shade for the spectators who watched the show in blistering sun and heat. The aim {{of this paper is}} to understand if velaria, beside their primary function, could affect the acoustics of the theatres. A specific study was carried out with the use of a commercial software for the prediction of room-acoustics characteristics of halls. Actually, numerical simulations were aided by acoustic measurements performed in two existing theatres, namely the "Teatro Grande" in Pompeii and the "Teatro Romano" in Benevento as they are in the present state. Both theatres are used rather regularly for public shows including music of various genres and drama. Like other ancient theatres not in a good state of conservation both theatres are deficient of natural reverberation because of the lack of structural elements important for this acoustic feature. To overcome inherent drawbacks electroacoustic means are used. However, there are instances where these remedial measures are not appropriate. The results of this study show that the use of suitable awnings can improve the reverberation in these venues...|$|R
50|$|With the {{spiralling}} cost of petrol, both AvGas and MoGas, {{the need}} to economise on fuel usage becomes more important. Glider tugs flying from smaller airfields typically fly two circuits for every launch, due {{to the need for}} rope dropping. To remove the need for rope dropping the FVA students designed and built a retractable tow-rope system that could be retrofitted to glider-tugs. A small winch fitted inside the tug carries the tow-rope when retracted. For launch the rope is pulled out by hand and attached to a Tost hook at the extreme tail of the tug with the rope extending behind the tug to the glider, ensuring that the load from the tow is taken by the tugs structure, not the winch. When the tow is finished the tug-pilot <b>retracts</b> the tow <b>rope,</b> automatically releasing the Tost hook, enabling the tug to land directly without carrying out a rope-dropping circuit. The prototype 'FVA-24 WiMi' system was successfully fitted to the FVA club's Grob G 109 motor-glider tug.|$|R
50|$|Commonly used {{to shade}} a window, with a roller tube at the top, {{spring-loaded}} side arms, and a motor, crank or tape-pull operator. Awnings with sides are {{commonly known as}} traditional style awnings as they have been used for many years dating back to the early 19th century using cotton canvas fabric. Canvas was replaced in the 1960s by more acrylic materials and polyester in more recent times driven by a focus on the environment. Traditional style awnings are appropriate for historical buildings and are still popular today using a more weather resistant fabric such as a solution dyed acrylic fabric such as Sunbrella Fabric and a rope and pulley system for retracting the awnings. Awnings without sides do not provide as much sun protection as those with sides. Awnings without sides come in many different styles. Drop Arm Awnings without sides come with roller tubes at the top and are available with motors and wind sensors for automatic retraction. Spear Awnings are made without sides and are made with Wrought Iron Frames and they can be <b>retracted</b> with a <b>rope</b> and pulley system but are not available with motors.|$|R
