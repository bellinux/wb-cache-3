60|$|Of these animals, the {{descendants}} of the savage herds which anciently roamed free in the Caledonian forests, it was formerly a point of state to preserve a few in the parks of the Scottish nobility. Specimens continued within the memory of man to be kept at least at three houses of distinction--Hamilton, namely, Drumlanrig, and Cumbernauld. They had degenerated from the ancient race in size and strength, if we are to judge from the accounts of old chronicles, and from the formidable remains frequently discovered in bogs and morasses when drained and laid open. The bull had lost the shaggy honours of his mane, and the race was small and light made, in colour a dingy white, or rather a pale yellow, with black horns and hoofs. They retained, however, in some measure, the ferocity of their ancestry, could not be domesticated on account of their antipathy to the human race, and were often dangerous if approached unguardedly, or wantonly disturbed. It was this last reason which has occasioned their being extirpated at the places we have mentioned, where probably they would otherwise have been <b>retained</b> <b>as</b> <b>appropriate</b> inhabitants of a Scottish woodland, and fit tenants for a baronial forest. A few, if I mistake not, are still preserved at Chillingham Castle, in Northumberland, the seat of the Earl of Tankerville.|$|R
40|$|Turbulence in fluids is {{commonly}} observed to coexist with relatively large {{spatial and temporal}} scale coherent jets. These jets may be steady, vacillate with a definite period, or be irregular. A comprehensive theory for this phenomenon is presented based on the mutual interaction between the coherent jet and the turbulent eddies. When a su#cient number of statistically independent realizations of the eddy field participate in organizing the jet a simplified asymptotic dynamics emerges with progression, as an order parameter such as the eddy forcing is increased, from a stable fixed point associated with a steady symmetric zonal jet through a pitchfork bifurcation to a stable asymmetric jet followed by a Hopf bifurcation to a stable limit cycle associated with a regularly vacillating jet and finally a transition to chaos. This underlying asymptotic dynamics emerges when a su#cient number of ensemble members is retained in the stochastic forcing of the jet but qualitative di#erent mean jet dynamics is found when {{a small number of}} ensemble members is <b>retained</b> <b>as</b> is <b>appropriate</b> for many physical systems. Example applications of this theory are presented including a model of midlatitude jet vacillation, emergence and maintenance of multiple jets in turbulent flow, a model of rapid reorganization of storm tracks as a threshold in radiative forcing is passed, and a model of the quasi-biennial oscillation. Because the statistically coupled wave/mean flow system discussed is generally globally stable this system also forms the basis for a comprehensive theory for equilibration of unstable jets in turbulent shear flow...|$|R
