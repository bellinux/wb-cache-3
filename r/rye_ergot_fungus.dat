40|$|Abstract. <b>Rye</b> <b>ergot</b> (Claviceps purpurea) {{occasionally}} causes toxicity (chiefly {{expressed as}} hyperthermia) in Australian livestock, {{either as a}} result of grazing infected annual (Lolium rigidum) and perennial (L. perenne) rye grasses, or if the ergot sclerotia produced in rye grasses contaminate grain crops used as stockfood. Alkaloids in 30 samples of Australian <b>rye</b> <b>ergot</b> sclerotia taken from rye grasses and grain screenings, and some feed samples contaminated with <b>rye</b> grass <b>ergot</b> sclerotia, were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography. Samples originated from across southern Australia. Ergotamine was the dominant alkaloid in all samples, followed by a-ergocryptine, ergocornine, ergosine and their respective-imine epimers. Ergotamine concentrations in sclerotia ranged up to 2257 mg/kg (as received basis). Ergocristine was a very minor component (< 50 mg/kg) in all samples. Total alkaloids in freshly collected sclerotia ranged from 1003 to 3321 mg/kg (0. 10 to 0. 33 %), and up to 3766 mg/kg with epimers included, although lower concentrations were found in samples stored for some time. Alkaloid profiles in sclerotia were all very similar, and concentrations {{did not appear to be}} related to size of sclerotia, source region, nor to the rye grass or grain from which they were taken. Previous cases of toxicity in livestock are reviewed and several new cases are reported.

40|$|Along {{with many}} other {{problems}} that livestock producers have {{had to deal with}} {{as a result of the}} ever changing climate Ergotism can now be added to the list. <b>Ergot</b> is a <b>fungus</b> that grows on the seed head of cereal grains and grasses.

50|$|Ergot {{is a type}} of fungus {{that tends}} to grow on cereals and grasses, {{including}} rye. The fungus Claviceps spp. infects the flowering head and replaces grain of the <b>rye</b> with an <b>ergot</b> that’s a hard and compact fungal mycelium, deep purple in color. In addition, sweet ergot honeydew oozes from these flowering heads. Insects often feed on this exudate and serve as vectors that carry it from source to source. Examination of Polistes dorsalis during their foraging behavior found presence of fungal conidia on various parts of their body including antennae, mouthparts, and in their gut. Therefore, this species of wasp has been identified as one of these insects, potentially transmitting this causal <b>ergot</b> <b>fungus.</b> This is part of the wasp’s foraging behavior, as it is focused on exclusively locating fungal infected grasses and collecting this ergot honeydew. P. dorsalis carries the droplets in their mouthparts from infected grass like Paspalum dilatatum Pior, then crawls or moves through hopping flights towards other florets in the area. Polistes can also differentiate infected grass heads from uninfected ones, and usually land on uninfected grasses for grooming purposes only. Stopping on these grooming sites increase the likelihood of them serving as vectors for the spread of fungal infection, in addition to visiting various grass species during foraging.|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackground: Previous {{analyses}} of the biosynthesis of the alkaloid cyclopeptides from the <b>ergot</b> <b>fungus</b> Claviceps purpurea were hampered {{by a lack of}} suitable systems for study in vitro, and this led to conflicting results concerning the mechanism of alkaloid cyclopeptide formation. Recently, D-lysergyl peptide synthetase (LPS) of the <b>ergot</b> <b>fungus</b> Claviceps purpurea, which assembles the non-cyclol precursors of the ergopeptines, has been partially purified and shown to consist of two polypeptide chains of 370 kDa (LPS 1) and 140 kDa (LPS 2); these contain all the sites necessary for the assembly of the D-lysergyl peptide backbone. The mechanism of D-lysergyl peptide synthesis remained unclear, however. Results: We have identified the obligatory peptidic intermediates in d-lysergyl peptide synthesis and the sequential order of their formation. The two LPS subunits catalyze the formation of d-lysergyl mono-, di-, and tripeptides as enzyme-thioester intermediates, the formation of which appears to be irreversible. Peptide synthesis starts when d-lysergic acid binds to the LPS 2 subunit, which most probably occurs after the previous round of synthesis has been completed by the release of the end product from the LPS enzyme. Conclusions: We have shown that the mechanism of d-lysergyl peptide synthesis is an ordered process of successive acyl transfers on a multienzyme complex. This knowledge opens the way for enzymatic and genetic investigations into the formation of novel alkaloid cyclopeptides...|$|R

50|$|Ergotamine is a {{secondary}} metabolite (natural product) {{and the principal}} alkaloid produced by the <b>ergot</b> <b>fungus,</b> Claviceps purpurea, and related fungi in the family Clavicipitaceae.

These precursor compounds are the substrates for the enzyme, tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase, catalyzing {{the first step in}} ergot alkaloid biosynthesis, i.e., the prenylation of L-tryptophan. Further reactions, involving methyltransferase and oxygenase enzymes, yield the ergoline, lysergic acid. Lysergic acid (LA) is the substrate of lysergyl peptide synthetase, a nonribosomal peptide synthetase, which covalently links LA to the amino acids, L-alanine, L-proline, and L-phenylalanine. Enzyme-catalyzed or spontaneous cyclizations, oxygenations/oxidations, and isomerizations at selected residues precede, and give rise to, formation of ergotamine.|$|R

Results indicated that a second mutation of all three types of mutants could improve alkaloid yield and vegetative vigor. In addition, a second mutation increased the frequency of auxotroph production. The difficulty of producing stable mutants from ergot strains that have multinucleated cells and that do not readily produce conidia in culture, such as an ergotamine-producing strain, was overcome by first forming protoplasts of the fungus and then subjecting them to the mutagen.
