40|$|Introduction: Work-related {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{account for a}} high proportion of work-related injuries in developed countries, including Australia. Many of these disorders are the result of manual handling injuries. For that reason, the assessment of dynamic material handling, particularly lifting, is a critical component of all functional capacity evaluations (FCEs). Aim: This presentation will discuss the assessment <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> using various protocols and systems, the application of these protocols, and their limitations, as well as address the issue of evacuee safety when assessing dynamic material handling. Approach: A descriptive literature review was conducted of published research to determine the reliability and validity <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> assessments used either as stand-alone assessments or as part of an FCE. Aspects covered in the presentation will include safety and lifting techniques, determining the endpoint of testing, review <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> assessment components in FCEs including their application and limitations, and predicting frequent lifting from occasional lifting results. Practice Implications and Conclusion: Manual handling is assessed by all FCEs and several other assessments specifically developed to evaluate lifting. Occupational therapists are required to assess clients’ capacity for a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>lifting</b> and manual handling tasks and {{need to be aware of}} those not all lifting evaluations are equivalent.

The rotors were 5. 417 ft in diameter and differed only in blade planform geometry. The four planforms were: (1) rectangular; (2) 3 : 1 linear taper starting at 94 percent radius; (3) 3 : 1 linear taper starting at 75 percent radius; and (4) 3 : 1 linear taper starting at 50 percent radius.
