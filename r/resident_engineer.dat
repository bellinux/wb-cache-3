5|$|Barlow {{returned}} to Britain in 1838 {{to take up}} a post as assistant engineer on the Manchester and Birmingham Railway working for George W. Buck. In 1842, he joined the Midland Counties Railway as <b>resident</b> <b>engineer</b> for the section between Rugby and Derby. When the Midland Counties Railway became part of the Midland Railway in 1844, he retained the position, later becoming chief engineer of the larger railway. On 1 April 1845, Barlow was elected a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers and on 6 June 1850 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.|$|E

50|$|Brereton was {{recruited}} by Brunel staff in 1836 {{to be one}} of seven <b>resident</b> <b>engineers</b> supervising the construction of the Great Western Railway. He lost an eye in a work accident and is depicted in a portrait with an eye patch. After the Great Western railway was completed, he carried out similar tasks on other railways that Brunel was building. For example, in 1845 he was one of Brunel's <b>resident</b> <b>engineers</b> on the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway and was sent to Italy to sort out problems with the construction of the Turin-Genoa railway.|$|R
5|$|Despite the Holderness scheme, {{there were}} still {{problems}} near Leven and Weel, and William Jessop spent a month inspecting the area before writing a report in July 1786. His plan advocated separating the water which fell on the uplands {{to the north and}} flowed through the low-lying areas, from the local drainage of those low-lying areas. George Plummer carried out most of the subsequent survey work on Jessop's behalf, although Jessop surveyed the River Hull in 1787, to identify how the outfall could be improved. Jessop visited the works from time to time, making seven visits between 1789 and 1792, while the day to day oversight of the scheme was handled by Plummer as <b>resident</b> <b>engineer.</b> Plummer was succeeded by Anthony Bower, who was engineer from 1792 to 1795, and the whole scheme was completed in 1805, having cost £16,000.|$|E
5|$|From {{the opening}} of the line, {{passenger}} stock consisted of 4-wheel carriages. In 1845, there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London, with half that number on Sundays. On 23June 1849, the Royal Train took Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Tunbridge Wells to visit Queen Adelaide, the Queen Dowager. The train, consisting of the Royal Saloon, two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from Bricklayers Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes. It was driven by James Cudworth, the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 70 minutes. The Royal Train visited the line again on 18December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor, Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise. The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes. The train was driven by William Jacomb, <b>Resident</b> <b>Engineer</b> of the LSWR, and Edgar Verringer, Superintendent of the LSWR. At Waterloo, driving of the train was taken over by John Shaw, General Manager of the SER and Mr. Cockburn, Superintendent of the SER. The return journey took 105 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{was born}} in Wadsley, Sheffield, Yorkshire, England, to land {{surveyor}} John Fowler and his wife Elizabeth (née Swann). He was educated privately at Whitley Hall near Ecclesfield. He trained under John Towlerton Leather, engineer of the Sheffield waterworks, and with Leather's uncle, George Leather, on the Aire and Calder Navigation and on railway surveys. From 1837 he worked for John Urpeth Rastrick on railway projects including the London and Brighton Railway and the unbuilt West Cumberland and Furness Railway. He then worked again for George Leather as <b>resident</b> <b>engineer</b> on the Stockton and Hartlepool Railway and was appointed engineer to the railway {{when it opened in}} 1841. Fowler initially established a practice as a consulting engineer in the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire area, but, a heavy workload led him to move to London in 1844. He {{became a member of the}} Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1847, the year the Institution was founded, and a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1849. On 2 July 1850 he married Elizabeth Broadbent (died 19 November 1901), daughter of J. Boadbent of Manchester. The couple had four sons.|$|E
50|$|Construction of {{buildings}} {{for use by}} railway staff and the station itself was underway in May 1880, with the station master’s house (used initially as the <b>resident</b> <b>engineer’s</b> office), followed {{a month or two}} later by the station building.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{graduation}} Paton joined Sir Alexander Gibb & Partners, {{which had}} been founded in 1922. One of his first jobs there was {{to assist with the}} design of a new jetty for Barking Power Station. In 1927 he worked on a dam at Maentwrog in North Wales and between 1932 and 1933 was <b>resident</b> <b>engineer</b> on the Glenlee portion of the Galloway hydro-electric power scheme. Paton was seconded to the Rangoon Port Trust in 1930 to construct a wharf for the export of Lead from Burma. This wharf survived a serious earthquake on 5 May 1930 and was opened on 20 February 1931. On 10 April 1931 Paton sailed to Canada to undertake a survey of its ports and outline the additional facilities that would be required in the next 25–50 years. He was assisted in this for six weeks by Ralph Freeman who had designed the Sydney Harbour Bridge. The report was issued on 15 January 1932 but was not implemented until 1935 with the election of William Lyon Mackenzie King as Prime Minister of Canada. The report's findings continued to be in use until the 1970s. Paton was responsible {{for the construction of a}} new brewery for Guinness in Park Royal, London from October 1933 to October 1936. This was the biggest job of his career thus far and involved the construction of seven steel framed buildings, a power station, a storage silo, roads and railway sidings. Paton also built industrial and trading estates in Wales, West Cumberland and London. He was made a partner in the firm in 1938.|$|E
25|$|The {{engineer}} {{for the whole}} line was William Jessop, and the <b>resident</b> <b>engineer</b> was Thomas Hollis, and he was probably allowed considerable autonomy by Jessop.

50|$|In 1851 {{he moved}} to Holland, where he was {{appointed}} Assistant Engineer for the Amsterdam Waterworks under Bland W. Croker, and was appointed Chief Engineer himself in 1855. In 1859 he obtained a position {{as one of the}} <b>Resident</b> <b>Engineers</b> on the Madras Irrigation and Canal Company's Works, and was propmoted to Deputy Chief Engineer in 1869. In 1871, when these works were approaching completion, Mr. Gordon was appointed Chief Engineer for Water-Supply in Victoria, Australia. As Chief Engineer he continued the works of the Coliban Water-Supply for Bendigo and other towns of the goldfields district.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened in}} April 1883, {{originally}} with three platforms, the main platform {{of which had}} a weatherboard signal cabin, ticket office and the <b>resident</b> <b>engineers</b> office, {{like the one at}} Ambleside. The island platform had a shelter shed, this smaller platform has been removed but is unclear when, probably c. 1995. The goods platform and goods shed still remain. The yard layout has been rationalised in recent years, with the removal of the dead end siding at the eastern end of the yard, and the conversion of the goods siding to a dead-end siding, now used to stable track machines.|$|R
25|$|During 1846 to 1849 George Turnbull was the <b>resident</b> <b>engineer</b> under William Cubitt for the London District of the Great Northern Railway. Turnbull {{oversaw the}} {{construction}} of King's Cross station and the first 20 miles of line out of London, including bridges, multiple cuttings and (sequentially from London) the Copenhagen (700 yards long), Tottenham, South Barnett, North Barnett and South Mimms tunnels (he was particularly proud of the alignment of the tunnels).|$|E
25|$|In other {{carriages}} {{were members}} of her Majesty’s suite and {{the directors of the}} York, Newcastle, and Berwick Railway. The engine drawing the royal train was under the direction of Mr T. E. Harrison, the <b>resident</b> <b>engineer,</b> and driven by Mr Thos. Carr... After staying altogether from five to ten minutes, the train was again put in motion, and amidst firing of artillery and rapturous plaudits from the dense throng, proceeded en route to Darlington.|$|E
25|$|Burton {{studied at}} Edinburgh Collegiate School, {{but instead of}} going on to university, from 1873 he {{signed up for a}} five-year {{apprenticeship}} with the innovative hydraulic and mechanical engineers Brown Brothers & Co. Ltd at the Rosebank Ironworks in Edinburgh. Rising to become chief draftsman, he left the firm in 1879 to enter partnership with his uncle Cosmo Innes in London designing water systems. In 1881 he became <b>Resident</b> <b>Engineer</b> to the London Sanitary Protection Association.|$|E
50|$|For {{the line}} itself, the first ground was ceremonially cut near {{the western end}} of the tunnel on 1 October 1838. The {{following}} year the line had been marked out, land purchase was proceeding well, and construction had begun with Thomas Brassey as contractor. However a number of shareholders were defaulting on their payments. Moreover, the relationship between the Board and its engineer were becoming increasingly strained. Vignoles resigned and Joseph Locke was asked if he would take over. Locke replied that he was already well occupied with two other railways and that he would act in a consultative capacity if the Board would appoint <b>resident</b> <b>engineers</b> for the day to day supervision of the work.|$|R

50|$|Normanhurst {{was derived}} from the name of a {{prominent}} <b>resident,</b> civil <b>engineer</b> Norman Selfe (1839-1911), with hurst being the English word for a wooded hill. Ironically, Selfe protested against the name change. The railway station was renamed in 1900 and was used for the suburb that developed around it.|$|R
25|$|The Act {{created the}} Company of Proprietors of the Lancaster Canal Navigation, {{and gave them}} powers to raise £414,100 by the issuing of shares, and an {{additional}} £200,000, either by mortgage or by issuing more shares, if required. John Rennie was appointed as engineer in July 1792, with William Crossley the elder as his assistant, and Archibald Millar as <b>resident</b> <b>engineer</b> and superintendent. A second Act of Parliament was obtained in May 1793 to authorise {{the construction of the}} Glasson branch, so that the canal had a connection to the sea.|$|E
25|$|Each of {{the twelve}} frames of the shield weighed over seven tons. The key {{innovation}} of the tunnelling shield was its support for the unlined ground in front and around it {{to reduce the risk}} of collapses. However, many workers, including Brunel himself, soon fell ill from the poor conditions caused by filthy sewage-laden water seeping through from the river above. This sewage gave off methane gas which was ignited by the miner's oil lamps. When the <b>resident</b> <b>engineer,</b> John Armstrong of Ingram Northumberland , fell ill in April 1826 Marc's son Isambard Kingdom Brunel took over at the age of 20.|$|E
25|$|Some work {{continued}} until 1775, consisting largely of raising river banks, making drains deeper, and extending the drains {{that had been}} created. However, the system was inadequate, as there were large areas that remained under water near Leven, {{in the north of}} the area, and at Weel, to the east of Beverley. Flooding during the winter months was still a regular problem, because the drains could not cope with rain from the low-lying carrs, when they were full with water from higher ground to the north of Holderness. The engineer William Jessop spent a month investigating the problems, studying some , and presented a report in July 1786. Further survey work was then carried out by George Plummer, and formed the basis for Jessop's detailed plan, which was agreed in 1787. He produced specifications for drains, embankments, dams and tunnels, with the overriding principle that the water from the uplands to the north should be kept entirely separate from the internal drains of the area. Once the project got under way, Jessop visited {{from time to time to}} check on progress. He made a total of seven visits between 1789 and 1792, when his involvement and that of George Plummer, who had acted as <b>resident</b> <b>engineer,</b> ceased. Anthony Bower then took over as <b>resident</b> <b>engineer,</b> overseeing the work until 1795. This phase of the scheme was finally completed in 1805, at a cost of £16,000.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} {{a perspective}} on learning how to share knowledge {{in the context of}} inter-firm networks and highlights the essential role of participation in collaborative activities. This perspective suggests that knowledge sharing is not something achieved through the simple transfer of resources, but rather is an ongoing social accomplishment in which network firms constitute and re-constitute knowledge while engaging in collaborative activities. Empirical support for this view is offered by an in-depth and multiyear study of the development of collaborative relationships between a leading racing car manufacturer and its suppliers in the Italian motorsport industry. The study shows that knowledge is generated over time through the instigation of three knowledge sharing processes: the promotion of a culture of working together, co-location and the use of <b>resident</b> <b>engineers,</b> and shared education and training...|$|R
50|$|John Dixon {{started work}} as a bank clerk and in 1821, {{at the age of}} 26, {{assisted}} George and Robert Stephenson to survey the Stockton and Darlington Railway. Dixon became one of the two <b>Resident</b> <b>Engineers</b> when George was later awarded the post of Engineer. Dixon is listed as an assistant engineer when the company of George Stephenson & Son was formed to survey and build railways at the end of 1824. He assisted George building the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and was at the Rainhill Trials, and wrote a letter, which still exists, describing the event to his brother James. He was an engineer for the Grand Junction Railway, and returned to Darlington become Chief Civil Engineer to the Stockton and Darlington Railway between 1842 and 1865.|$|R
