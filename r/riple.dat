40|$|Various {{forms of}} Peer-Learning Environments are {{increasingly}} being used in post-secondary education, often to help build repositories of student generated learning objects. However, large classes can result in an extensive repository, which can make it more challenging for students to search for suitable objects that both reflect their interests and address their knowledge gaps. Recommender Systems for Technology Enhanced Learning (RecSysTEL) offer a potential {{solution to this problem}} by providing sophisticated filtering techniques to help students to find the resources that they need in a timely manner. Here, a new RecSysTEL for Recommendation in Peer-Learning Environments (<b>RiPLE)</b> is presented. The approach uses a collaborative filtering algorithm based upon matrix factorization to create personalized recommendations for individual students that address their interests and their current knowledge gaps. The approach is validated using both synthetic and real data sets. The results are promising, indicating <b>RiPLE</b> is able to provide sensible personalized recommendations for both regular and cold-start users under reasonable assumptions about parameters and user behavior.

40|$|SUMMARY. Mosaic olivine textures, with {{straight}} <b>riple</b> grain boundaries meeting at angles of 12 o ~, {{are common in}} dunites. This is a well-known feature of annealed metals, and {{is the result of}} grain-boundary migration during recrystallization i which the system tends toward a state of minimum interfacial energies. Geometrically similar textures are present at the boundaries between such mosaic grains and strain-banded relict olivine grains. The unstrained mosaic grains make angular projections into the strained grains exactly at the junctions between the deformation bands. These are interpreted to be triple junctions with the two differently oriented bands acting as separate grains, and thus also due to recrystallization. BOTH Lauder (I 965, p. 479) and Challis (I 967, p. 200) have drawn attention to certain textural relationships involving strain-banded olivine grains in dunite, and both inter-pret these features in terms that support heir general contention that the intrusions of the New Zealand peridotite belt are the product of essentially magmatic processes. The purpose of this note is to propose an alternative explanation. The textural element in question is the geometry of the boundary between olivine grains with pronounced undulatory extinction bands and the adjacent smaller un...|$|E

We use a standard quantitative general equilibrium trade model with many countries and sectors and trade in intermediates, as in Costinot and Rodríguez-Clare (2014). We simulate a range of counterfactuals reflecting alternative options for EU-UK relations following Brexit. Welfare losses for the average UK household are 1. 3 % if the UK remains in the EU's Single Market like Norway (a “soft Brexit”). Losses rise to 2. 7 % if the UK trades with the EU under World Trade Organization rules (a “hard Brexit”). A reduced form approach that captures the dynamic effects of Brexit on productivity more than <b>riples</b> these losses and implies a decline in {{average income per capita}} of between 6. 3 % and 9. 4 %, partly via falls in foreign investment. These negative effects are widely shared across the entire income distribution and are unlikely to be offset from new trade deals...|$|R
40|$|A unique, {{generally}} accepted, methodology {{to predict}} the failure conditions and load of adhesive bonds is still lacking. The primary distinction {{that needs to be}} done is between: i) rupture conditions, which inevitably involve material non-linearity; ii) design conditions, within linearity limits. Typically, the research is focussed on i), and this excludes the numerous solutions or numerical models based on linear elasticity. A first research line on bond failure relies on adhesive plasticity. Hart-Smith [1] obtained design charts admitting that at the ends of the overlap the adhesive yields plastically. Later, Crocombe and co-authors [2] assumed global yielding of the adhesive to be the key phenomenon. A second research line, appeared since early 1970 ‘s [3], is based on fracture mechanics; the related tests are focussed on the adhesive strength by using ad hoc specimens (double cantilever beam, end notched flexure). In a design perspective, the problem in applying fracture mechanics is that the existence of a crack must be assumed somehow. A synthesis of these two approaches, likely the most popular today, is given by damage mechanics, in particular by the cohesive zone used to describe the failure of the adhesive [4]. Clearly, all these methodologies require numerical modelling. On the other hand, in a simpler perspective oriented to joint design, criteria based on adhesive elastic stresses have been also proposed [5], to help dimensioning the joints. These are based on conventional stresses, for which a limit combination can be easily assessed experimentally, under both static and dynamic (impact) conditions. The proposed presentation aims at giving an overview of the available approaches, trying to identify merits, lacks and needs for future developments. [1] L. J. Hart-Smith, Tech. Rep.

60|$|But {{all this}} was of no {{consequence}} here, there being none to observe my behavior or habit. And so, without fear and without controul, I proceeded on my journey, the prosecution of which took me up five or six days. I first travelled along the sea shore, directly {{to the place where}} I first brought my boat to an anchor, to get upon the rocks; but now having no boat to take care of, I went overland a nearer way to the same height that I was before upon; when looking forward to the point of the rock, which lay out, and which I was forced to double with my boat, I was amazed to see the sea so smooth and quiet, there being no <b>ripling</b> motion, nor current, any more than in other places. This made me ponder some time to guess the reason of it, when at last I was convinced that the ebb setting from the west, and joining with the current of water from some great river on shore, must be the occasion of these rapid streams; & that, consequently, as the winds blew more westwardly, or more southwardly, so the current came he nearer, or went the farther from the shore. To satisfy my curiosity, I waited there till evening, when the time of ebb being made, I plainly perceived from the rock the current again as before, with the difference that it ran farther off, near half a league from the shore, whereas in my expedition, it set close upon it, furiously hurrying me and my canoe along with it, which at another time would not have done. And now I was convinced, that, by observing the ebbing and flowing of the tide I might easily bring my boat round the island again. But when I began to think of putting it in practice, the remembrance of the late danger, struck me with such horror, that I changed my resolution, and formed another, which was more safe, though more laborious; and this was to make another canoe, and to have one for one side of the island, and one for the other.|$|R

A regular configuration on p points with regularity ρ on l blocks is a pair (P,L) where L is a collection of 3 -subsets of a (usually small) set P so that every p in P is in exactly ρ elements of L,and|L | = l. The Pasch configuration ({ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }, { 012, 035, 245, 134 }) has p= 6, l= 4, and ρ= 2. A λ–TS(V,B), is resolvable into a regular configuration C=(P,L), or C–resolvable, if B can be partitioned into sets Πi so that for each i, (V,Πi) is isomorphic to a set of vertex disjoint copies of (P,L). If the configuration is a single block on three points this corresponds to ordinary resolvability of a Triple System. In this paper we examine all regular configurations C on 6 or fewer blocks and construct C–resolvable λ–Triple Systems of order v for many values of v and λ. These conditions are also sufficient for each C having 4 blocks or fewer. For example for the Pasch configuration λ ≡ 0 (mod 4) andv ≡ 0 (mod 6) are necessary and sufficient...|$|E
40|$|The unique high {{altitude}} (> 3, 500 m a. s. l.) brackish and freshwater lakes of the Ladakh region, India, {{are used as}} breeding grounds and staging sites by migratory waterfowl and waders. A survey of the abundance and diversity of birds at four lakes in eastern Ladakh in July 2007 found that the diversity of birds in these lakes (Tsokar, Statsapuk Tso, Thasangkaru Tso and Tsomoriri) was relatively low. Eleven species were identified, ranging from the widespread Common Redshank Tringa totanus (590 individuals) to the highly endangered Black-necked Crane Grus nigricollis (three individuals). Among the four lakes, bird abundance and diversity was highest in Statsapuk Tso and Tsokar, respectively, and lowest in Thasangkaru. The importance of the lakes for waterbird conservation in Ladakh is discussed in relation to environmental changes in the area. Key words: Avifauna, Changthang, Tsokar, waterfowl, wetland. Ladakh, enclosed by the Karakoram mountain range {{to the north and}} the Greater Himalaya to the south, is a region of cold desert characterised by low primary production, with flora and fauna adapted to the {{high altitude}}s (Kachroo et al. 1977; Pfister 2004). Owing to its location in an area where the Palaearctic meets the Orient and also to the great altitudinal gradients in the region, Ladakh harbours a diverse range of> 270 bird species from 41 families (Pfister 2004). The wetlands of eastern Ladakh, especially the high altitude lakes, have been identified as important habitats for breeding and non-breeding migratory birds (Pfister 2004; Chandan et al. 2006). The marshlands around these lakes are used as staging sites by birds migrating between central and southern Asia (Ali & <b>Riple...</b>|$|E
