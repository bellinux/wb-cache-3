40|$|Book synopsis: Out {{of public}} sight {{for over a}} hundred years, the Livre de caricatures tant bonnes que mauvaises is a {{remarkable}} work. This collection of comic and satirical drawings was created by a Parisian luxury embroiderer, Charles-Germain de Saint-Aubin, {{at a time of}} <b>rigid</b> <b>press</b> censorship to entertain a small group of family and friends. For today’s reader the Livre provides not only a series of richly imaginative and varied drawings, but also a fascinating and intriguing commentary on pre-Revolutionary Paris. In this first comprehensive study of the Livre de caricatures, which includes over 190 illustrations, an international team of scholars investigates the motivations and operations behind the making of the book, and the many facets of Parisian life that it illuminates. Embracing politics and religion, theatre, fashion and connoisseurship, and the court of Versailles and the Parisian streets, the scope of the Livre is immense. The work’s unique quality is evident in its humour – whimsical, fantastical, challengingly allusive, but not without a sharp political edge when targeting clerics, the court and Louis XV’s mistress, Madame de Pompadour. Known within the Saint-Aubin family as the Livre de culs, the Livre delights in the transgression of social convention and the keen deflation of vanity and pretence. Contributors explore this irreverent image of eighteenth-century Paris in all its glory.

40|$|Contact between curved rough bodies is an {{important}} engineering problem. The paper addresses the problem in its simplest form where a smooth <b>rigid</b> cylinder <b>presses</b> down an elastic half space bounded by a plane of uniformly spaced cylindrical asperities. Keeping the separation between the bodies unchanged the problem is inverted and solved using the method of complex variables. As the asperities deform as well as move as rigid bodies, contact lengths and positions develop non-symmetrically {{with respect to the}} initial axes of symmetry of the asperities. The resulting local contact pressures are non-Hertzian and the normal load for a given contact area is greater than that estimated using a priori Hertzian pressure profiles...|$|R

Other variations include the walking press, taking a step forward with each press, perhaps alternating hands, and the seated press, where the trainee sits {{on the ground with}} straight legs while pressing overhead.|$|R
50|$|Hymenonema laconium is a {{perennial}} herbaceous plant of 20-70 cm high, with minute pale glandular hairs and longer hairs without glands. The number chromosomes is twenty (2n = 20). Both {{surfaces of the}} leaves are densely set with <b>rigid</b> hairs <b>pressed</b> to their surface. The leaves in the basal roset are 7-25 cm long and pinnately segmented, sometimes with teeth at the margin. The top segment {{is larger than the}} lateral segments, and 1½-3 cm wide, or sometimes a little as 1 cm. Between one and six smaller leaves are distanced along the stem, the lowest pinnately segmented, the higher increasingly simple, small and narrow. Each stem carries between one and three flowerheads. The involucre is 1½-2½ cm high and 1½-2¼ cm wide, with the individual bracts without hair, ovate to oblong-ovate in shape, with a rounded tip and an entire or dentate margin. The pits in the common base of the florets (called the receptacle) are each circled by a row of long hairs. The fruits (or cypselas) are 4-5 mm migh and topped by the changed calyx called pappus. On the outer cypselas the pappus takes the shape of trifid scales, the middle branch of which is prolonged as a rigid hair. On the inner cypselas, there is a row of rigid hairs encircling a row of lanceolate scales that change at the tip into a rigid hair.|$|R
40|$|A quasistatic {{unilateral}} frictionless contact {{problem for}} a <b>rigid</b> axisymmetric indenter <b>pressed</b> into a homogeneous, linearly elastic and transversely isotropic elastic layer bonded to a homogeneous, linearly elastic and transversely isotropic half-space is considered. Using the general solution to the governing integral equation of the axisymmetric contact {{problem for a}}n isotropic elastic half-space, we derive exact equations for the contact force and the contact radius, which are then approximated {{under the assumption that}} the contact radius is sufficiently small compared to the thickness of the elastic layer. An asymptotic analysis of the resulting non-linear algebraic problem corresponding to the fourth-order asymptotic model is performed. A special case of the indentation problem for a blunt punch of power-law profile is studied in detail. Approximate force-displacement relations are obtained in explicit form, which is most suited for development of indentation tests. 1...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) An {{investigation}} of starting powder morphology and loading {{effects on the}} properties of a yttria stabilised zirconia powder (3 mol% Y₂O₃-ZrO₂) has been undertaken. A commercially available grade of spray dried powder (TZ 3 Y) was sieved to obtain a range of size distributions which constituted varying morphology. The sieved ranges were compacted using a conventional rigid die pressing method and by shock compaction through use of gas driven gun launched projectiles and explosively driven flyer plates. The three compaction methods provided {{a wide range of}} strain rate and pressure. The morphology of the sieved ranges was characterised through image analysis and the frictional behaviour characterised through flow and packing tests. Further characterisation involved the use of a nano-hardness indenter to measure the strength of individual powder agglomerates through indentation of polished cross-sections. Differences were observed in the flow behaviour, however agglomerate strength did not vary as function of agglomerate size. The rigid die loading responses of the sieved size ranges in terms of pressure - density relationships were monitored up to a pressure of 590 MPa. The agglomerate size range was not found to affect the loading response, despite differences observed in flow and packing tests. An existing shock compaction model by Page et al. (1997) was modified such that the loading response, modelled using a modified Heckel relationship, could be altered according to the estimate post - shock temperature. This was possible as the Heckel relationship contained a term related to the particle strength, and temperature - strength data was available for TZ 3 Y. Comparison with the measured shock Hugoniout indicated that the model with the particle strength fixed showed better agreement than the variable strength model. Shock compacted samples produced in the gas gun were compared in the green and sintered states with <b>rigid</b> die samples <b>pressed</b> to 100 MPa. Evidence of wave interaction effects leading to cracking were observed in the gun compacted samples and green densities were higher than rigid die samples. The increased green densities led to a reduction in the sintering temperature of between 100 - 200 °C required to achieve a given hardness and density. The explosively compacted sampled contained regions of near full density without the need for subsequent sintering. This was however to the detriment of overall sample integrity as the conditions required to attain such properties also resulted in the formation of a heat affected porous phase. Starting agglomerate size was not noted to affect the properties of shock compacts...|$|R
