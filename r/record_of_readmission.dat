40|$|Background: Readmissions {{following}} acute {{myocardial infarction}} (AMI) are costly and may be partly due to poor care. A previous systematic review examined the literature through 2007. Since then, health policy has changed and additional articles examining predictors <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> have appeared. We sought to conduct a systematic {{review of the literature}} after 2007 regarding socio-demographic, clinical, psychosocial, and hospital level predictors <b>of</b> 30 -day <b>readmissions</b> after acute coronary syndrome. Methods: A systematic search of the literature using Pubmed, OVID, ISI web of science, CINAHL, ACP and the Cochrane Library was conducted, including a quality assessment using Downs and Black criteria. Articles reporting on 30 -day readmission rate and examining at least one patient-level predictor <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> at 30 days were included; articles examining interventions to reduce readmissions were excluded. Results: Twenty-two studies were included in this review from which more than 60 predictors <b>of</b> 30 -day <b>readmission</b> were identified. Age, co-morbidity, COPD, diabetes, hypertension and having had a previous AMI were all consistently associated with higher risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission.</b> However, no studies reported psychosocial factors as predictors <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> at 30 days. Conclusion: Studies <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> should adjust for age and co-morbidity, consistent predictors <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> at 30 -days. Patients with these risk factors for readmission should be targeted for more-intensive follow-up after discharge. Psychosocial predictors <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> remains a relatively unexplored area of research...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} study was to investigate common causes and pattern of short- and long-term readmissions stroke patients by conducting a systematic review of studies using hospital administrative data. Common risk factors associated with the change <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> rate were also examined. Methods The literature search was conducted from 15 th February to 15 th March 2016 using various databases, such as Medline, Embase, and Web of Science. Results There were total of 24 studies (n= 2, 126, 617) included in the review. Only 4 studies assessed causes <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> in stroke patients with the follow-up duration from 30 days to 5 years. Common causes <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> in majority <b>of</b> the studies were recurrent stroke, infections and cardiac conditions. Common patient-related risk factors associated with increased readmission rate were age and history of coronary heart disease, heart failure, renal disease, respiratory disease, peripheral arterial disease and diabetes. Among stroke-related factors, length of stay of index stroke admission was associated with increased readmission rate, followed by bowel incontinence, feeding tube and urinary catheter.

Data were collected using standardized assessments of demographic factors and comorbidities, as well as longitudinal <b>records</b> <b>of</b> hospital <b>readmissions,</b> complications, and mortality. RESULTS: The readmission rate was 5. 8 % for RYGB and 1. 2 % for AGB patients 30 days after discharge. The greatest predictors for readmission following RYGB were prolonged length of stay (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 2. 3; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 2. 0 - 2. 7), open surgery (OR, 1. 8; CI, 1. 4 - 2. 2), and pseudotumor cerebri (OR, 1. 6; CI, 1. 1 - 2. 4). Prolonged length of stay (OR, 2. 3; CI, 1. 6 - 3. 3), history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism (OR, 2. 1; CI, 1. 3 - 3. 3), asthma (OR, 1. 5; CI, 1. 1 - 2. 1), and obstructive sleep apnea (OR, 1. 5; CI, 1. 1 - 1. 9) were associated with the greatest increases in readmission risk for AGB. The 30 -day mortality rate was 0. 14 % for RYGB and 0. 02 % for AGB. CONCLUSION: Readmission rates are low and mortality is very rare following bariatric surgery, but risk for both is significantly higher after RYGB. Predictors <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> were disparate for the two procedures. Results do not support excluding patients with certain comorbidities since any reductions in overall readmission rates would be very small on the absolute risk scale.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationships between appropriateness <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> within two weeks of discharge and appropriateness of previous admission and discharge, bed section, type <b>of</b> <b>readmission,</b> and patient demographic, medical condition, and hospital stay characteristics. Using the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Patient Treatment File and medical records, 445 readmissions to a highly affiliated midwestern VA Medical Center in fiscal year 1984 were examined. Appropriateness was determined by four trained medical record abstractors using InterQual admission and discharge standards.

For the majority <b>of</b> inappropriate <b>readmissions,</b> there was clear written evidence in the medical record during the previous hospital stay that the patient was directed to return for readmission. Inappropriate readmissions were more likely than appropriate readmissions to have a primary diagnosis of neoplasm or digestive disorder.

40|$|Background: Readmission rates after {{surgical}} procedures {{are viewed as}} a marker of quality of care and as a driver to improve outcomes in the United Kingdom, they are not remunerated. However, readmissions are not wholly avoidable. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop a regional overview <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> to determine the proportion that might be avoidable and to examine predictors <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> at a unit level. Methods: We undertook a prospective multicenter audit <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> following National Health Service funded general {{surgical procedures}} in five National Health Service hospitals and three independent sector providers over a 2 -wk period. Basic demographic and procedure data were captured. Readmissions to hospitals were identified through acute admissions lists.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether {{number of doses}} per day and number of medications are significantly associated with the number <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> and to study the association <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> frequency with other medical and socio-demographic variables. Methods: Retrospective cross-sectional study involving 432 patients who were readmitted within 15 ¬†days of previous hospital discharge between January 1, 2013 and March 31, 2013. Relevant medical records were collected from the national electronic databases of every public tertiary hospital in Singapore. Significant variables (p¬†<¬† 0. 05) were identified using forward selection and modeled using generalized linear mixed models. Results: A total <b>of</b> 649 unplanned <b>readmissions</b> were reviewed. At a multivariable level, number <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> {{was significantly associated with}} the number of medications (p¬†=¬† 0. 002) and number of doses per day (p¬†=¬† 0. 003) after adjusting for race, liver disease, schizophrenia and non-compliance. Conclusion: Complex medication regimen (i. e. multiple medications and multiple doses per day) is a statistically significant predictor <b>of</b> number <b>of</b> <b>readmissions.</b> Simplifying therapeutic regimens with alternatives such as longer-acting or fixed-dose combination drugs may facilitate better patient adherence and reduce costly readmissions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Increased {{interest}} {{in health care}} cost containment is focusing attention on reduction <b>of</b> hospital <b>readmissions.</b> Major payors have already developed financial penalties for providers that generate excess readmissions. This subject has benefitted from the development of resources such as the Potentially Preventable Readmissions software. This process has encouraged hospitals to renew efforts to improve these outcomes. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe quantitative tools such as definitions, risk estimation, and tracking of patients for reducing hospital readmissions. Findings This study employed the Potentially Preventable Readmissions software to develop quantitative tools for addressing hospital readmissions. These tools included two definitions <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> that support identification and management of patients. They also included analytical approaches for estimation of the risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> for individual patients by age, discharge status of the initial admission, and severity of illness. They also included patient specific spreadsheets for tracking of target populations and for evaluation of the impact of interventions. Conclusions The study demonstrated that quantitative tools including the development <b>of</b> definitions <b>of</b> <b>readmissions,</b> estimation <b>of</b> the risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission,</b> and patient specific spreadsheets could contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes in hospitals. </p...|$|R
40|$|Hospital {{readmission}} {{rate has}} become a major indicator of quality of care, with penalties given to hospitals that have high rates <b>of</b> <b>readmission.</b> At the same time, insurers are applying increasing pressure to improve efficiency and reduce costs, including decreasing hospital lengths of stay. We analyze these trends to determine if reducing lengths of stay (LOS) may actually worsen <b>readmission</b> rates. All <b>records</b> <b>of</b> patients admitted to the neurosurgical service at one hospital from October 2007 through June 2014 were aggregated and analyzed for several variables, including initial length <b>of</b> stay, <b>readmission</b> occurrence, and length of stay, admitting diagnosis, admission priority and discharge disposition. Any trends over time were also noted. 925 out of 9, 409 patient encounters are readmissions. Readmission rate and average length of stay were found significantly negative correlated. Besides linear regression which directly connecting average length <b>of</b> stay and <b>readmission</b> rate, survival analysis methods with Cox proportional hazard ratio model were employed to determine which factors were associated with a higher risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission.</b> There was a clear increase in readmissions over the study period, but LOS remained relatively constant, suggesting that increasing medical complexity confounded efforts to decrease LOS and was responsible for increased readmission rates.

40|$|Objectives. Clinical {{practice}} guidelines {{based on}} the results of randomized clinical trials recommend that patients with heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) be treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) at doses shown to reduce mortality and readmission. This study examined the relationship between ACEI use at discharge and readmission among patients with heart failure due to LVSD. Methods and results. Data were abstracted from the medical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> 2943 randomly selected patients hospitalized for heart failure in 50 hospitals. The outcome of interest was the number <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> occurring up to 21 months after discharge. Six-hundred and eleven patients were eligible for analysis.

Methods: We prospectively reviewed medical <b>records</b> <b>of</b> adult internal medicine patients with scheduled and unscheduled 30 -day readmissions. We also interviewed patients if they were available. An independent panel used pre-specified, objective criteria to adjudicate potential avoidability. Results: <b>Of</b> 153 <b>readmissions</b> evaluated, 68 % were unscheduled. Among these, 67 % were unavoidable, primarily due to disease progression and development of new diagnoses.

40|$|Objective: We {{compared}} service consumption, {{continuity of}} care and risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> in a <b>record</b> linkage follow-up study of cohorts of patients with schizophrenia and related disorders in Victoria (Australia) and in Groningen (The Netherlands). These areas are interesting to compare because mental health care is in a different stage of deinstitutionaliza-tion. More beds are available in Groningen and more community resources are available in Victoria. Method: The cohorts were followed for 4 years, since discharge from in-patient services using record linkage data available in the psychiatric case-registers in both areas. Survival {{analysis was used to}} study {{continuity of care}} and risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission.</b> Results: Available indicators showed a higher level of continuity of care in Victoria.

40|$|ABSTRACT Background: Congenital heart defects (CHD) are {{a common}} {{congenital}} anomaly that leads to extensive use of healthcare resources, yet there is little information available on the rates <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> or the factors that predispose to readmission within 30 days of discharge. We sought to evaluate!the rate <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> among patients with CHD and to analyse the factors associated with! readmission. Methods: Retrospective study using data concerning all patients with an ICD= 10 code from Q 20 to Q 25 hospitalised between 2002 and 2014 at the University Hospital <b>of</b> Lausanne. <b>Readmission</b> and association with socio-clinical factors were evaluated for all non-humanitarian patients {{under the age of}} 18. Results: 996 patients younger than 18 were hospitalised for CHD, 332 undergoing surgery. 96 patients (9. 6 %) were readmitted within 30 days of discharge, 83 (86. 5 %) cardiac causes. Median time to readmission was 10 days (interquartile range: 6 - 20) and median length <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> was 12 days (interquartile range: 6 - 20).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} patterns <b>of</b> hospital <b>readmission</b> for asthma in South Australia from 1989 to 1996, {{in relation}} to implementation of the National Asthma Campaign. DESIGN AND SETTING: A comparison of hospital admissions in South Australia of patients aged between one year and 49 years for three conditions: asthma (or respiratory failure with asthma as an underlying condition) and two control conditions [...] diabetes and epilepsy. Individuals were identified by Medicare number and date of birth. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hospital readmission within 28 days and within one year. RESULTS: Overall, by 1996, there was a statistically significant decline in the risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> for asthma within 28 days of 18 % and within one year of 17 % compared with 1989 readmission rates. There were no reductions in the risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> for diabetes or epilepsy, suggesting that the decline in risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> for asthma was greater than the underlying effects of general changes in hospital casemix. CONCLUSIONS: The decline in risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> may reflect changes in asthma severity or improved management practices.

40|$|Background: Readmission {{rates are}} {{projected}} to serve as quality measures that {{have the potential to}} negatively impact hospital and physician reimbursement. Individual physicians and hospitals are developing plans to reduce readmission rates. Successful plans should be based on specific data obtained from each individual type of practice. Objective: To analyze the etiological factors responsible for readmissions to various teaching services in a community hospital. This will serve to identify potentially correctable factors that will be the basis for developing practice-specific plans to reduce readmissions. Design: Retrospective detailed chart review. Setting: Community teaching hospital affiliated with a large academic health care system. Participants: Patients admitted to teaching services at a community hospital. Measurements: Data are presented as descriptive analysis. Results: Advanced chronic medical conditions (31 %), patients&#x 2019; lifestyle choices (28 %), and new unrelated diagnoses (21 %) are the major causes <b>of</b> <b>readmissions.</b> The remaining small percentage <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> is attributed to premature discharge, poor discharge planning, poor post-discharge follow-up, medication errors, and failure to implement medical care guidelines.

40|$|Introduction: Internationally, {{hospital}} readmissions {{have a great}} appeal as {{an indicator}} of hospital quality. Since possibilities in prevention and control exist, reducing rates <b>of</b> hospital <b>readmission</b> has attracted attention of policymakers as a way to improve quality of care while simultaneously reducing costs. Therefore reducing the number <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> {{is considered to be a}} pillar of more cost-effective hospital care. The goal of this study was to estimate the cost <b>of</b> hospital <b>readmissions</b> at a national level, describe differences in readmission rates between hospitals and to calculate the potential monetary savings <b>of</b> reducing excess <b>readmissions.</b> Methods: Stays data were obtained from the Minimum Basic Data Set 2008 in a sample of 45 hospitals representing 16, 141 beds. Readmissions were identified as a second admission for the same patient with the same APR-DRG code within 1 month or 3 months after discharge. Hospital type, diagnosis-related group, age and gender were used as matching factors in comparing readmission rates. Specific types <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> that occur naturally in each other‚Äôs proximity due to the repeating nature of the therapy were excluded from the analysis. The costs per readmission were then calculated by linking the stays data with the cost data per APR-DRG and per severity index using the 2008 national feedback. The results of our sample were then extrapolated to all Belgian hospitals in order to calculate the total cost <b>of</b> <b>readmissions.</b> By means <b>of</b> a sensitivity analysis we estimated potential monetary savings when a reduction in the incidence <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> in hospitals having a higher readmission rate in comparison to other hospitals would be realized. Results: In our sample 1. 5 % readmissions within 1 month after discharge and 2. 1 % within 3 months after discharge were identified. The additional weighted mean cost <b>of</b> these <b>readmissions</b> was ‚Ç¨ 3, 495. 58 within 1 month and ‚Ç¨ 3, 572. 20 within 3 months. The total financial burden, as extrapolated to the Belgian setting, is estimated at ‚Ç¨ 280, 091, 471. The wide variability between hospitals in incidence <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> (1. 17 - 6. 40 %) indicates a potential for improvement. For instance, if all Belgian hospitals having a higher readmission rate improve their rate to the level of the hospital corresponding to percentile 75 (= 2. 4 % readmissions) savings would amount to ‚Ç¨ 14, 118, 509. Conclusion: The observed incidence <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> is associated with important additional healthcare costs. Although not all readmissions can be prevented, there is clearly a potential to increase cost-effectiveness of hospital care delivery...|$|R

30|$|Many HRPS use binary {{classification}} labels when predicting readmission [9, 14, 17, 32 ‚Äì 35]. However, staffing {{resources are}} often limited and a probability <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> is potentially more useful. Sorting a group <b>of</b> patients by <b>readmission</b> probability allows {{patients with the}} highest readmission probability to be allotted {{the greatest number of}} resources. Though many supervised machine learning algorithms have the ability to coerce classification distribution, the NB machine learning algorithm naturally produces posterior probabilities without coercion [19]. Therefore, NB can be used to sort patients by likelihood <b>of</b> <b>readmission.</b> This is useful when resources are limited and an optimal subset of patients must be selected to minimize penalties.|$|R

40|$|Background Psychoeducation {{programmes}} {{for people}} with schizophrenia are shown to reduce relapses but few studies have indicated significant improvements in patients' illness awareness and insight, functioning, symptom severity or rates <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> to hospital. Aims To {{examine the effects of}} a mindfulness-based psychoeducation programme for Chinese people with schizophrenia. Method A multisite randomised controlled trial was conducted with 107 out-patients with schizophrenia: 36 and 35 received a 6 -month mindfulness-based psychoeducation and a conventional psychoeducation programme, respectively, and 35 received routine care alone. Patient outcome measures were psychiatric symptom severity, psychosocial functioning, social support, insight into illness/treatment, and frequency and duration <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> to hospital (ClinicalTrials. gov: trial registration NCT 01667601). Results The mindfulness-based psychoeducation group reported significantly greater improvements in psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial functioning, insight into illness/treatment and duration <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> to hospital over 24 months when compared with the other two groups. Conclusions Mindfulness-based psychoeducation appears to be a promising approach to treatment for Chinese patients with schizophrenia. School of Nursin...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} the {{diagnostic}} composition of the inpatient population of Ontario and Canadian psychiatric facilities has shown an important change in hospital-treated illness over the period 1941 - 71. Patients with nonpsychotic disorders accounted for 54 % of all admissions to Ontario public mental hospitals in 1971, compared with only 8 % in 1941. The trend was similar for both first admissions and proportion <b>of</b> <b>readmissions,</b> and was similar for psychiatric units of general hospitals. In contrast, the overall rate of first admission for psychotic disorders to inpatient facilities remained remarkably constant over time, as did the proportion <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> among all admissions. The findings dispel {{the notion that the}} increasing proportion <b>of</b> <b>readmissions</b> is due largely to a rapid turnover of former long-stay psychotic patients (the "revolving-door phenomenon"). The findings could not be attributed to a changing prevalence of types of psychiatric illness, increased availability of psychiatric inpatient facilities or comprehensive medical insurance...|$|R

40|$|Hospital {{readmission}} {{has become}} a critical metric of quality and cost of healthcare. Medicare anticipates that nearly $ 17 billion is paid out on the 20 % of patients who are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Although several interventions such as transition care management and discharge reengineering have been practiced in recent years, the effectiveness and sustainability depends on how well they can identify and target patients {{at high risk of}} rehospitalization. Based on the literature, most current risk prediction models fail to reach an acceptable accuracy level; none of them considers patient's history <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> and impacts <b>of</b> patient attribute changes over time; and they often do not discriminate between planned and unnecessary readmissions. Tackling such drawbacks, we develop a new readmission metric based on administrative data that can identify potentially avoidable readmissions from all other types <b>of</b> <b>readmission.</b> We further propose a tree based classification method to estimate the predicted probability <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> that can directly incorporate patient's history <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> and risk factors changes over time. The proposed methods are validated with 2011 - 12 Veterans Health Administration data from inpatients hospitalized for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the State of Michigan. Results shows improved discrimination power compared to the literature (c-statistics> 80 %) and good calibration. Comment: 30 pages, 4 figures, 7 table...|$|R
40|$|Background: Almost one {{in every}} 10 {{patients}} who survive intensive care will be readmitted to {{the intensive care unit}} (ICU) during the same hospitalisation. The association between increasing severity of illness (widely calculated in ICU patients) with risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> to ICU has not been systematically summarised. Objective: the meta-analysis was designed to combine information from published studies to assess the relationship between severity of illness in ICU patients and the risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> to ICU during the same hospitalisation. Data sources: Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE (1966 to August 2008), EMBASE (1980 - 2008), and CINAHL (1982 to August 2008). Review methods: Studies included only adult populations, readmissions to ICU during the same hospitalisation and reports of valid severity of illness index. Results: Eleven studies (totalling 220, 000 patients) were included in the meta-analysis. Severity of illness (APACHE II, APACHEI II, SAPS and SAPS II) measured at the time of ICU admission or discharge, was higher in patients readmitted to the ICU during the same hospitalisation compared to patients not-readmitted (both p-values, 0. 001). The risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> to ICU increased by 43 % with each standard deviation increase in severity of illness score (regardless if measured on admission to, or discharge from the ICU) (odds ratio (OR) = 1. 43, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 3 - 1. 6). Conclusions: A relationship between increasing intensive care severity of illness and risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> to ICU was found. The effect was the same regardless of the time of measurement of severity of illness (at admission to ICU or the time of discharge from ICU). However, further research is required to develop more comprehensive tools to identify patients at risk <b>of</b> <b>readmission</b> to ICU to allow the targeted interventions, such as ICU-outreach to follow-up these patients to minimize adverse events...|$|R
