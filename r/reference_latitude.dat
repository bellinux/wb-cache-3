40|$|In this paper, a new {{two-dimensional}} blocking {{index is}} proposed by defining {{a difference between}} the daily 500 -hPa geopotenial heights at the <b>reference</b> <b>latitude</b> and its north side. The <b>reference</b> <b>latitude</b> is determined by a composite latitude-dependent 500 -hPa geopotenial height of blocking events in different seasons and sectors. The new index can take account of the duration, intensity, propagation, and spatial structure of a blocking event. Using this index, the characteristics (frequency, duration, intensity, and preferred occurrence region) of the blocking action in the North Hemisphere (NH) are investigated using a 42 -yr sample of blocking events from the NCEP–NCAR reanalyses. It is found that blocking events in the NH are more frequent in the Atlantic–Europe sector than in the Pacific sector in winter and spring and autumn, but more persistent in the Atlantic–Europe sector than in the Pacific sector for all seasons. Blocking events in the Pacific sector tend to have larger amplitudes than the Atlantic counterparts. In addition, it is shown that in the NH independently occurring blocking events are most frequent, but simultaneously occurring blockings are rather rare, indicating that the blocking events in the NH should be a local phenomenon. On the other hand, a comparison with the existing indices [e. g., Tibaldi and Molteni (TM) index] indicate...|$|E

40|$|The dissipation/development {{trend of}} {{tropical}} cyclones (TCs) approaching {{to the south}} coast of Japan Islands was investigated. Among 203 cases from 1979 to 2013, 23 cases (11 %) developed more than 7. 5 hPa and 66 cases (33 %) dissipated more than 7. 5 hPa during their migration after crossing a southern <b>reference</b> <b>latitude</b> (27 °N). For the developed case Typhoon Roke (T 1115) and the dissipated case Typhoon Jelawat (T 1217) atmospheric and oceanic environment along their tracks were closely analyzed. Roke passed over the Kuroshio region, when it began to develop, where the warm current (≥ 26 ℃) was thick and the tropical cyclone heat potential (TCHP) was high. Decrease of sea surface temperature (SST) caused by passage of Roke was low over the Kuroshio Current. It was considered that the thick warm layer suppressed the typhoon’s self-induced ocean cooling over the Kuroshio Current, which in turn brought about a favorable condition for intensification of typhoon. Jelawat rapidly dissipated though the oceanic condition was not unfavorable for development. According to the cyclone phase space (CPS) analysis, it was shown that Jelawat had already started its extratropical transition when it passed over the <b>reference</b> <b>latitude,</b> 27 °N, as the upper westerly shifted southward...|$|E

40|$|On {{planetary}} scales, {{surface wind}} stress and differential buoyancy forcing act together to produce isopycnal surfaces that are relatively flat in the tropics/subtropics and steep near the poles, where {{they tend to}} outcrop. Tilted isopycnals in a rapidly rotating fluid are subject to baroclinic instability. The turbulent, mesoscale eddies generated by this instability {{have a tendency to}} homogenize potential vorticity (PV) along density surfaces. In the Southern Ocean (SO), the tilt of isopycnals is largely maintained by competition between the steepening effect of surface forcing and the flattening effect of turbulent, spatially inhomogeneous eddy fluxes of PV. Here we use quasi-geostrophic theory to investigate the influence of a planetary-geometric constraint on the equilibrium slope of tilted density/buoyancy surfaces in the SO. If the meridional gradients of relative vorticity and PV are small relative to β, then quasi-geostrophic theory predicts ds/dz = β/ f 0 = cot(ϕ 0) /a, or equivalently r ≡ |∂zs/(β/ f 0) | = 1, where s is the isopycnal slope, ϕ 0 is a <b>reference</b> <b>latitude,</b> a is the planetary radius, and r is the depth-averaged criticality parameter. We find that the strict r = 1 condition holds over specific averaging volumes in a large-scale climatology. A weaker r = O(1) condition for depth-averaged quantities is generally satisfied away from large bathymetric features. We employ the r = O(1) constraint to derive a depth scale to characterize large-scale interior stratification, and we use an idealized sector model to test the sensitivity of this relationship to surface wind forcing. Finally, we discuss the possible implications for eddy flux parameterization and for the sensitivity of SO circulation/stratification to changes in forcing...|$|E

40|$|The {{collision}} of anticyclonic, lens-like eddies with a meridional western boundary is investigated {{as a function}} of two independent, nondimensional numbers: ß = ß 0 R/f o and e = ¿/f o, where f 0 and ß 0 are the Coriolis parameter and its rate of change with latitude, respectively, both evaluated at the <b>reference</b> <b>latitude.</b> R is the eddy's radius, and ¿ is its angular frequency. The numerical experiments show that in all cases there is a southward expulsion of mass proportional to both ß and e. which is estimated during the eddy-boundary interaction. The eddies are invariably deformed with the initial collision, but afterward, they reacquire a new circular shape. There is a meridional translation of the eddy along the boundary which depends exclusively on the initial ratio r = e/ß. If r 2 ̆ 6 gt; 1, the eddy goes southward, but if r 2 ̆ 6 lt; 1, the eddy goes northward first and then southward. As the eddy loses mass and reacquires a new circular shape, there is a readjustment of ß and e such that ß decreases because its radius becomes smaller and e increases by energy conservation. This implies that the eddies ultimately migrate southward. A formula, derived for the meridional speed of the center of mass of the eddy is consistent with the numerical results. A physical interpretation shows that after collision a zonal force is exerted on the eddy by the wall which is balanced by a meridional migration. Nonlinearities induce a southward motion, while high ß values could produce northward motion, depending on the mass distribution along the wall...|$|E

40|$|We {{present in}} a {{statistical}} study a comparison of thermospheric mass density enhancements (ρ rel) with electron temperature (T e), small-scale field-aligned currents (SSFACs), and vertical ion velocity (V z) at high latitudes around noon magnetic local time (MLT). Satellite data from CHAMP (CHAllenging Minisatellite Payload) and DMSP (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program) sampling the Northern Hemisphere during the years 2002 – 2005 are used. In a first step we investigate {{the distribution of the}} measured quantities in a magnetic latitude (MLat) versus MLT frame. All considered variables exhibit prominent peak amplitudes in the cusp region. A superposed epoch analysis was performed to examine causal relationship between the quantities. The occurrence of a thermospheric relative mass density anomaly, ρ rel > 1. 2, in the cusp region is defining an event. The location of the density peak is taken as a <b>reference</b> <b>latitude</b> (Δ MLat = 0 °). Interestingly, all the considered quantities, SSFACs, T e, and V z are co-located with the density anomaly. The amplitudes of the peaks exhibit different characters of seasonal variation. The average relative density enhancement of the more prominent density peaks considered in this study amounts to 1. 33 during all seasons. As expected, SSFACs are largest in summer with average amplitudes equal to 2. 56 μA m − 2, decaying to 2. 00 μA m − 2 in winter. The event related enhancements of T e and V z are both largest in winter (Δ T e = 730 K, V z = 136 m s − 1) and smallest in summer (Δ T e = 377 K, V z = 57 m s − 1. Based on the similarity of the seasonal behaviour we suggest a close relationship between these two quantities. A correlation analysis supports a linear relation with a high coefficient {{greater than or equal to}} 0. 93, irrespective of season.

The study aims at designing a high altitude long endurance solar powered aircraft for a surveillance mission to carry a 100 kg payload and operate over a particular area in Iraq which lies between latitudes 290 N and 380 N. The design approach has proved its capability by producing acceptable results for the weight and the power of each aircraft component. This approach also facilitates exploring the possible design space for a given mission in which the optimal weight and its corresponding set of characteristics can be easily concluded. The study shows that increasing the reference altitude can lead to a heavier aircraft in spite of the high levels of the available solar energy that can be harvested. Nevertheless, the surface area required for solar power generation is less than that needed to obtain sufficient lift when the aircraft was designed to operate at higher altitudes.

The outline of the star chart can be constructed by considering the astronomical information given in the planisphere alone and the drawing method described in Xin-Tangshu; further the chart can be completed by using additional information on the shape and linking method of asterisms out of an inherited star chart. The circles of perpetual visibility, the equator, and the circle of perpetual invisibility are concentric, and their common center locates the Tianshu-xing, which was defined to be a pole star in the Han dynasty. The radius of the circle of perpetual visibility was modified {{in accordance with the}} latitude of Seoul, whereas the other circles were drawn for the latitude of 35 °, which had been the <b>reference</b> <b>latitude</b> in ancient Chinese astronomy. The ecliptic was drawn as an exact circle by parallel transference of the equator circle to fix the location of the equinoxes at the positions recorded in the epitaph of the planisphere. The positions of equinoxes originated from the Han dynasty. The 365 ticks around the boundary of the circle of perpetual invisibility were possibly drawn by segmenting the circumference with an arc length instead of a chord length with the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter as accurate as 3. 14 presumed. The 12 equatorial sectors were drawn on the boundary of the star-chart in accordance with the beginning and ending lodge angles given in the epitaph that originated from the Han dynasty. The determinative lines for the 28 lunar lodges were drawn to intersect their determinative stars, but seven determinative stars are deviated. According to the treatises of the Tang dynasty, these anomalies were inherited from charts of the period earlier than the Tang dynasty. Thus, the star chart in Cheonsang-yeolcha-bunyajido preserves the old tradition that had existed before the present Chinese tradition reformed in approximately 700 CE.

This study was conducted on the Argentinean continental shelf, southwestern Atlantic Ocean (34 - 56 °S). An intensive research on geo-referenced data was carried out to make a knowledge synthesis on echinoderm species and thus create a historical database. Multivariate analysis was used to analyse the faunal composition through latitudinal and bathymetric gradients as well as echinoderm associations. The results confirmed the existence of two faunal associations that correspond to the traditional zoogeographic scheme established for the Argentine Sea: the Argentinean and Magellan Provinces. The Argentinean Province had 46 widely distributed species. Of the 86 species recorded in the Magellan Province, a high percentage (25 %) were also found in Antarctic waters, suggesting a strong connection between the echinoderm fauna of this province and the Antarctic Region.

Up until {{the emergence of the}} nocturnal, the only way captains could keep track of time was through the use of sand or water clocks, for example an hourglass. However, they required the constant attention {{for the duration of the}} voyage in order to reset the cycles on the hour. With the publishing of the Arte of Navigation by Cortes came the first detailed description of the construction and use of a nocturnal, once again an apparatus that relied on the stars. The nocturnal revolutionized long distance seafaring by complementing the use of the astrolabe and ephemerides by now giving sailors an accurate tool with which to discover the time at their position. Both Zacuto and Cortes were respected mathematicians and had determined in their respective publications the trigonometric measurements concerning the degrees of latitude and longitude. If a ship’s pilot or navigator used the nocturnal to read their time, and then consulted an astrolabe in concert with astronomical charts they could determine the time distance between themselves and a fixed location. The trigonometry, dictated particularly in Zacuto’s work, then allowed a sailor to calculate the degree difference east or west of the fixed position. For instance, if the time variance between port and ship was two hours, a sailor would know that he was 30 degrees east of port, if he was sailing in the Atlantic from the Iberian Peninsula.

40|$|International audienceThe {{potential}} {{of using the}} latitudinal distributions of fossil wood genera {{as a proxy for}} Jurassic terrestrial climate conditions in western Laurasia was tested using a database of 386 entries. The fossil wood genera Brachyoxylon, Protaxodioxylon and Simplicioxylon are southern taxa, which have only occasionally extended north of 45 °N (all <b>latitude</b> <b>references</b> are to palaeolatitudes). Conversely, Protocedroxylon and Xenoxylon are mostly found at high latitudes. The standard deviation of the data on the palaeolatitudes of the northern genera is, however, much larger than that of the southern genera. This is interpreted as resulting from brief periodic southward extensions of the Protocedroxylon and Xenoxylon distributions, while the southern genera remained confined south of 40 °N. The interval during which the northern genera replaced the southern genera at mid-latitudes can be hypothesized to be times of global terrestrial climate cooling or increased rainfall. Comparisons between the spatiotemporal distributions of these ‘northern’ taxa and independent climate-sensitive indicators (clay mineral assemblages, oxygen isotopes, and neritic carbonate distribution) suggest that these genera were adapted to more humid conditions characterizing the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. Accordingly, southward migrations of this climatic zone occurred during the Early and Late Pliensbachian, Early Toarcian, and Early Middle Oxfordian time intervals. These reconstructions are limited by the low resolution and restricted spatial coverage of the wood record. Therefore, further sampling at the ammonite zone level is needed. Nevertheless, the present study suggests that wood taxa distribution represents an underexploited but potentially powerful record of terrestrial environmental changes during the Jurassic Period...|$|R

There is surprisingly little known {{about the fate of}} bleached corals, which may either regain their zooxanthellae and recover, or may die, in which case they generally become overgrown by macroalgae. The nature and dynamics of this algal overgrowth are not well understood. This study was done on Two-Mile Reef, Sodwana Bay, located in the iSimangaliso Wetland Park, a World Heritage Site. The first aim was to investigate the abundance and diversity of benthic algal communities colonising different hard substrata (comprising bleached digitate, brain and plate coral assemblages, and beach rock). The second was to compare the algal communities colonising various artificial hard substrata. The third was to document the species of non-geniculate coralline red algae found on the natural hard substrata during sampling. Fieldwork was carried out during the marine autumn (March) and spring (September) of 2010 using SCUBA. A total of 90 quadrats (10 cm x 10 cm) were sampled and the underlying substratum was recorded and classified.
