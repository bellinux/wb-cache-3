25|$|The Wankel {{engine is}} a type of {{internal}} combustion engine using an eccentric rotary design to convert pressure into rotating motion. In contrast to the more common reciprocating piston designs, the Wankel engine delivers advantages of simplicity, smoothness, compactness, high revolutions per minute, and a high power-to-weight ratio primarily {{due to the fact that}} it produces three power pulses per <b>rotor</b> <b>revolution</b> compared to one per revolution in a two-stroke piston engine and one per two revolutions in a four-stroke piston engine (although at the actual output shaft, there is only one power pulse per revolution, since the output shaft spins three times as fast as the actual rotor does, as can be seen in the animation below, making it roughly equivalent to a 2-stroke engine of the same displacement; this is also why the displacement only measures one face of the rotor, since only one face is working for each output shaft revolution). The engine is commonly referred to as a rotary engine, although this name also applies to other completely different designs, primarily aircraft engines with their cylinders arranged in a circular fashion around the crankshaft. All parts rotate consistently in one direction, as opposed to the common reciprocating piston engine, which has pistons violently changing direction. The four-stage cycle of intake, compression, ignition, and exhaust occur each revolution at each of the three rotor tips moving inside the oval-like epitrochoid-shaped housing, enabling the three power pulses per <b>rotor</b> <b>revolution.</b> The rotor is similar in shape to a Reuleaux triangle with sides that are somewhat flatter.|$|E

5000|$|Blade element theory (BET) is a {{mathematical}} process originally designed by William Froude (1878), David W. Taylor (1893) and Stefan Drzewiecki {{to determine the}} behavior of propellers. It involves breaking a blade down into several small parts then determining the forces {{on each of these}} small blade elements. These forces are then integrated along the entire blade and over one <b>rotor</b> <b>revolution</b> in order to obtain the forces and moments produced by the entire propeller or rotor. One of the key difficulties lies in modelling the induced velocity on the rotor disk. Because of this the blade element theory is often combined with the momentum theory to provide additional relationships necessary to describe the induced velocity on the rotor disk (for further details see Blade Element Momentum Theory). At the most basic level of approximation a uniform induced velocity on the disk is assumed: ...|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} study is performed on a three-bladed rotor model in two water tanks. The blade pitch, rotational velocity, descent angle, and descent speed are all varied {{in order to}} simulate {{a wide range of}} rotorcraft operating states, focusing on descent cases where the rotor is operating in or near vortex ring state — an area in which there is currently very little available data. Flow visualization is done by injecting air bubbles and fluorescent dye tangentially from the blade tips to mark the vortex core, showing the development of both short-wave (“sinuous”) and long-wave (“leapfrogging”) instabilities on the helical vortices in the wake. Strain gages are used to record transient loads, allowing a correlation between the rotor thrust performance and the development of the vortex wake. Reynolds numbers are of order 105 and test runs are performed for extended periods — up to 500 <b>rotor</b> <b>revolutions</b> — demonstrating the repeatability of the patterns of thrust variation. The data indicate that as the instabilities develop, adjacent vortices merge and form thick vortex rings, particularly during descent. Periodic shedding of these rings from the wake associated with vortex ring state is observed, resulting in peak-to-peak thrust fluctuations of up to 95 % of the mean and occurring at regular intervals of 20 — 50 <b>rotor</b> <b>revolutions,</b> depending on flow parameters.

The full span cell exhibited large tangential velocities, as well as strong axial velocity fluctuations near the rotor tip. The stall intensity, however, decreased towards the hub.

The advantage of the pseudospectral method, compared to other direct optimal control approaches, lies in its exponential convergence, implying increased computational efficiency, provided the functions under considerations are sufficiently smooth.

40|$|This study {{reports the}} use of a {{mechanical}} macerating device to characterise the patterns of, and resistance to, fragmentation of leaf and stem fractions of spear grass (Heteropogon contortus) and sabi grass (Urochloa mosambicensis). The four substrates, cut to a length of 1. 5 - 2 cm, were exposed to microbial fermentation in the rumen of cattle for periods of between 0 and 96 h. A novel macerating device was used to grind substrates in a water medium for a series of predetermined number of <b>rotor</b> <b>revolutions</b> of the macerator. The extent of fragmentation was then measured by wet sieving. Statistical modelling, using phase-type distributions, was used to describe the numbers of revolutions required to fragment the substrates into three compartments defined by particles retained on screens of 1180, 600, and 50 μm pore size. The study identified multi-exponential patterns of fragmentation of tropical grass fractions. Resistance to fragmentation of large particles, estimated by the number of <b>rotor</b> <b>revolutions</b> required for 0. 75 of particles to be removed from that pool, was high for both stem fractions, and was not markedly affected by time of microbial fermentation. Spear grass leaf had high resistance to fragmentation until exposed to microbial fermentation for 24 h, after which it attained the low resistance to fragmentation typical of sabi grass leaf at all microbial fermentation times. Fragmentability of large particles, defined as the proportion of small particles originating from the large particle pool which did not pass through the medium particle pool, was always high for leaf (> 0. 66), but for stem fractions it was quite variable. Sabi grass stem achieved maximum fragmentability values typical of leaf (0. 70), but for spear grass stem fragmentability was lower at 0. 52. The potential digestibility of particle fractions following various degrees of maceration, was assessed after in vitro fermentation for 120 h. Extensive maceration of samples not exposed to rumen fermentation increased sample digestibility of the leaf fractions by 3 to 7 %, and of stem of spear grass and sabi grass by 380 and 120 % respectively. For sabi grass stem, the relative increase in potential digestibility after maceration progressively declined in samples after rumen fermentation; no such decline was seen for spear grass stem. The implications of the results to nutritive value for the ruminant eating forage diets are discussed.

40|$|Aerodynamic {{stability}} {{is a fundamental}} limit in the compressor design process. The development of robust techniques for increasing stability has several benefits: enabling higher loading and fewer blades, increasing safety throughout a mission, increasing tolerance to stage mismatch during part-speed operation and speed transients, and providing an opportunity to match stages at the compressor maximum efficiency point, thus reducing fuel burn. Mass injection upstream of {{the tip of a}} high-speed axial compressor rotor is a stability enhancement approach known to be effective in suppressing stall in tip-critical rotors if the injection is activated before stall occurs. This approach to stall suppression requires that a reliable stall warning system be available. Tests have recently been performed to assess whether steady injection {{can also be used to}} recover from fully developed stall. If mass injection is effective in recovering from stall quickly enough to avoid structural damage or loss of engine power, then a stall warning system may not be required. The stall recovery tests were performed on a transonic compressor rotor at its design tip speed of 1475 ft/sec using four injectors evenly spaced around the compressor case upstream of the rotor. The injectors were connected to an external air source. In an actual engine application, the injected air would be supplied with compressor bleed air. The injectors were isolated from the air source by a fast-acting butterfly valve. With the injectors turned off, the compressor was throttled into stall. Air injection was then activated with no change in throttle setting by opening the butterfly valve. The compressor recovered from stall at a fixed throttle setting with the aid of tip injection. The unsteady operating characteristic of the rotor was measured during these tests using high-response pressure sensors located upstream and downstream of the rotor. The figure shows the results, where the unsteady pressure and mass flow are superimposed on the steady operating characteristic. The total injected mass flow was equal to 1. 3 percent of the compressor flow. The solid line with no solid squares on it denotes the operating point during the beginning of throttle closure and the initial drop into stall. The gray traces denote the operating point during an additional throttle closure that occurred over the next 1200 <b>rotor</b> <b>revolutions</b> (4 sec). The dashed line denotes the recovery from stall that occurred during 90 <b>rotor</b> <b>revolutions</b> (0. 3 sec) after the injectors were activated with no change in throttle setting. Tip injection not only recovers the compressor from stall, but also restores the compressor to its pre-stall level of pressure rise.
