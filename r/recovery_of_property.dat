25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a performance standard. Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. I am convinced that we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the constitutional principle that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E
500|$|Tracing is {{a process}} that allows for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> (such as land or money) by the owner if it is taken involuntarily, and the owner has not consented to the {{transfer}} of title. This can be through theft, breach of trust, or mistake. Owners can recover their property and perhaps also any profits made from it, or in situations where the property cannot be recovered (as it has been mixed in with other property, or cannot be found), substitute property. The process has two steps, following and tracing. In Foskett v McKeown, Lord Millett defined them by saying that [...] " [...] are both exercises in locating assets which may or may be taken to represent an asset belonging to the [...] and to which they assert ownership. The process of following and tracing are, however, distinct. Following is the process of following the same asset as it moves from hand to hand. Tracing is the process of identifying a new asset as the substitute for the old". Following, therefore, is simply establishing who the original owner of property is, where that property is, and returning it to the original owner. Tracing arises when the property cannot be returned and the court is asked to recognise an interest in new property, such as whatever the defendant received in exchange for the claimant's original property. Tracing can occur at both the common law and equity. It is not a remedy for breach of trust; tracing is merely the process of identifying the property. It is then up to the courts to decide what will happen to it.|$|E

5000|$|In the United States, detinue is a {{possessory action}} having for its object the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> {{specific}} personal <b>property</b> and damages for its detention. At common law an action of detinue would lie for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> specific personal <b>property</b> unlawfully detained, or its value, and for damages for its detention. Detinue differs from replevin in that {{possession of the}} chattel in controversy is not changed until after the judgment in detinue, whereas in replevin possession is changed {{at the beginning of}} the proceeding. The gist of an action in detinue is that the defendant is wrongfully in possession <b>of</b> personal <b>property</b> which belongs to the plaintiff [...] whereas replevin lies only where there has been a wrongful taking or seizure <b>of</b> the <b>property.</b> Detinue is distinguished from common-law trover which is for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> damages for the wrongful conversion <b>of</b> personal <b>property.</b> In modern practice, detinue has been superseded almost entirely by statutory actions for the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> personal <b>property.</b>|$|R

The effect of post weld artificial ageing on mechanical <b>properties</b> <b>of</b> friction stir weld was further investigated. The results indicate that longer holding time can be beneficial to the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> mechanical <b>properties</b> in the stirring zone.
