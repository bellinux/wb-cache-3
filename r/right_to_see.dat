5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial disorientation and loss of control.|$|E

And in Richfield Oil Corp., the Farmer board held that employers must bargain over employee stock plans they establish. But the Farmer board also limited bargaining rights in Bausch & Lomb Optical Co., holding that if a union invests its surplus dues in a business venture, and that venture competes with the employer, the employer {{does not have to}} bargain with the union.|$|E

25|$|In episode 2, Kat and Alfie {{are invited}} to Lance's wake by Peter, and when {{speaking}} to Agnes and Lance's daughter, Eileen Harrington (Angeline Ball), Kat realises that Andrew cannot be her son. Agnes confronts Kat and Alfie, so Kat realises that Lance told her why they are there. Agnes says Kat gave up her <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> her son when she gave him up, but Kat explains {{she did not know}} she had a son as she had passed out during the birth. Dermott and Tommy hear this, and Tommy asks if he has a big brother. Later, Kat and Alfie decide to return to Spain, but Tommy wants to find his brother. Tommy sneaks out of the house, and Kat and Alfie try to find him. Andrew's mother, Roisín Kelly (Maria Doyle Kennedy), tells Kat that she saw Tommy at the church, so they go there, followed by Agnes. They find Dermott praying with Tommy, who tells Kat that he found his brother. Kat realises that Dermott is her son, and Dermott confirms this. In episode 3, Kat and Dermott have bonded, but she lies to him about who his real father is. Dermott worries that Tommy will tell Peter the truth and threatens him. Alfie realises that Kat lied to Dermott, which results in an argument. Dermott overhears them arguing about him not knowing the truth and Kat refusing to tell him.|$|E

Protesters in Orlando carried signs with messages [...] "Knowledge is Free" [...] and [...] "Honk if you hate Scientology". According to WKMG-TV, the protesters called the Church of Scientology a [...] "dangerous cult" [...] and said the organization is responsible for crimes and deaths. The Orlando Sentinel reported that the protest was [...] "part of a worldwide campaign by a group that calls itself Anonymous", and an unnamed organizer who spoke to the paper stated that the group was protesting [...] "a gross violation of the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> free church material", referring to the Tom Cruise video that was pulled from YouTube.|$|E

500|$|The sequel [...] was {{released}} in 1990 for the MSX2. It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in Metal Gear Solid, including the three-dimensional element of height, allowing players to crouch and crawl into hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks. The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to plan ahead. The enemies had improved AI, including a 45-degree field of vision, turning their heads left and <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> diagonally, the detection of various different noises, being able to move from screen to screen (they were limited to a single screen in earlier games), and a three-phase security alarm (where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder, then remain {{on the lookout for}} some time after losing sight of the intruder, and then leave the area). The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics.|$|E
500|$|Following Ronnie's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Say what?" [...] Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were asked true or false {{questions}} about fan-submitted messages they had heard the previous night; an incorrect answer resulted in elimination, and the last HouseGuest remaining was the winner. Chima was the winner. On Day 34, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Goods" [...] luxury competition. For this competition, actor Jeremy Piven entered the house to inform the HouseGuests of the competition. The HouseGuests split into teams and were required to fill a station wagon with various items that were worth different amounts of points; the team would only earn a point for the items they successfully fit into their car, and {{the team with the}} most points would earn the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film The Goods. The team of Chima, Jordan, Jessie, Natalie, and Russell won the competition, meaning Jeff, Kevin, Lydia, and Michele were the Have-Nots for the week. Later that day, Chima chose to nominate Lydia and Russell for eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jeff, Kevin, and Natalie were selected to compete; Michele was selected to host. On Day 35, HouseGuests {{competed in the}} [...] "BB Farm" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to reach through a fence and attempt to get twelve eggs from {{the opposite side of the}} fence to them; the first HouseGuest to successfully get twelve eggs would win the Power of Veto. Kevin was the winner of the Power of Veto. On Day 37, Kevin chose not to use the Power of Veto on either nominee. On Day 40, Jeff chose to use the Coup d'État, thus overthrowing Head of Household Chima. He chose to remove both Lydia and Russell from the block, replacing them with Jessie and Natalie. Due to using the Coup d'État, Jeff was ineligible to vote during this eviction, as was Chima. Jessie then became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of three to two. He became the first member of the Jury of Seven.|$|E

2500|$|Penn {{demonstrated}} {{no remorse}} for his aggressive stance, {{and vowed to}} keep fighting against the wrongs of the Church and the King. For its part, the Crown continued to confiscate Quaker property and jailed thousands of Quakers. From then on, Penn's religious views effectively exiled him from English society; he was sent down (expelled) from Christ Church College of Oxford University for being a Quaker, and was arrested several times. Among {{the most famous of}} these was the trial following his 1670 arrest with William Mead. Penn was accused of preaching before a gathering in the street, which Penn had deliberately provoked to test the validity of the 1664 Conventicle Act, just renewed in 1670, which denied the right of assembly to [...] "more than five persons in addition to members of the family, for any religious purpose not according to the rules of the Church of England". Penn pleaded for his <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a copy of the charges laid against him and the laws he had supposedly broken, but the judge, Thomas Howel, refused, although this was a right guaranteed by law. Furthermore, the judge directed the jury to come to a verdict without hearing the defence.|$|E
2500|$|If {{a trustee}} has broken a duty {{owed to the}} trust, there are three main remedies. First, {{specific}} performance may generally be awarded {{in cases where the}} beneficiary merely wishes to compel a trustee to follow the trust's terms, or to prevent an anticipated breach. Second, for losses, beneficiaries may claim compensation. The applicable principles are disputed, given the historical language of requiring a trustee to [...] "account" [...] for things which go wrong. One view suggested that at the very moment a trustee breaches a duty, for instance by making an erroneous investment without considering relevant matters, beneficiaries have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the trust accounts are surcharged, to erase the transpiring loss (and [...] "falsified" [...] to restore to the trust fund unauthorised gains). In Target Holdings Ltd v Redferns the argument was taken to a new level, where a solicitor (a fiduciary, like a trustee) was given £1.5m by Target Holdings Ltd to hold for a loan for some property developers, but released the money before it was meant to (when purchase of the development property was completed). The money did reach the developers, but the venture was a flop, and money lost. Target Holdings Ltd attempted to sue Redferns for the whole sum, but the House of Lords held that the loss was caused by the venture flop, not the solicitor's action outside instructions. It was, however, observed that the common law rules of remoteness would not apply. Similarly in Swindle v Harrison a solicitor, Mr Swindle, could not be sued for the loss of Ms Harrison's second home's value after he gave her negligent and dishonest advice about loans, because she would have taken the loan and made the purchase anyway, and the house value drop was unrelated to his breach of duty.|$|E
