5|$|Nasser {{appointed}} Sadat and Hussein el-Shafei as {{his vice}} presidents in December 1969. By then, relations {{with his other}} original military comrades, namely Khaled and Zakaria Mohieddin and former vice president Sabri, had become strained. By mid-1970, Nasser pondered replacing Sadat with Boghdadi after <b>reconciling</b> with the latter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Reconciling</b> the {{continuity}} of the monthly strip with the stories that preceded and followed it presented difficulties, forcing the story's writers to alter its history in a number of ways, a technique known as retroactive continuity. Significantly, the strip rewrote various parts of Melchester's history, and shortened Roy Sr.'s recorded playing career to a more realistic level.|$|E

40|$|We {{have created}} a {{software}} infrastructure called <b>Reconcile</b> that is a platform {{for the development of}} learning-based noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution systems. <b>Reconcile’s</b> architecture was designed to facilitate the rapid creation of coreference resolutions systems, easy implementation of new feature sets and approaches to coreference resolution, and empirical evaluation of coreference resolvers across a variety of benchmark data sets and standard scoring metrics. <b>Reconcile</b> is written in Java and can be easily customized with different subcomponents, feature sets, and parameter settings. In this report, we describe <b>Reconcile’s</b> architecture, processing pipeline, and the subcomponents and algorithms that are currently implemented and available in <b>Reconcile.</b> We also present experimental results showing that <b>Reconcile</b> can be used to create a coreference resolver which achieves performance levels comparable to state-of-the-art systems on six benchmark data sets. ...|$|R
40|$|We discuss {{our recent}} {{approaches}} {{to enable the}} specication of a conceptual <b>reconciled</b> schema by directly manipulating source conceptual schemas. In particular, we use reverse engineering tools to reconstruct conceptual schemas when these are not available, and use iconic operators to specify how to map source schemas to the <b>reconciled</b> one. Moreover, we describe the mapping of the conceptual <b>reconciled</b> schema to a logical data model, including mechanisms to extract data from sources and loading them to <b>reconciled</b> database...|$|R
5|$|As he {{indicated}} in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his theological convictions about {{the connection between the}} physical and the spiritual; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the Son, and the intervening space between to the Holy Spirit. His first manuscript of Mysterium contained an extensive chapter <b>reconciling</b> heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.|$|E
5|$|Sugriva {{returns to}} the throne, but spends his time carousing and fails to act on his promise to assist Rama in {{recovering}} his kidnapped wife, Sita. Tara—now Sugriva's queen and chief diplomat—is then instrumental in <b>reconciling</b> Rama with Sugriva after pacifying Lakshmana, Rama's brother, {{who was about to}} destroy Kishkinda in retribution for Sugriva's perceived treachery. After this incident, Tara is only mentioned in passing references, as the mother of Angada and Queen of Sugriva, as the story moves from Kishkindha to the climatic battle in Lanka to retrieve Sita.|$|E
5|$|The Headphone Masterpiece is {{the debut}} album by American {{recording}} artist Cody Chesnutt. He recorded the album {{in his home}} bedroom with a 4-track recorder and played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an organ. A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and <b>reconciling</b> his love for rock and roll with the drawbacks of the rock lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} {{one of the largest in}} Medieval Europe and is {{regarded}} as the most important victory in the histories of Poland and Lithuania, also it's widely celebrated in Belarus. It has been used as a source of romantic legends and national pride, becoming a larger symbol of struggle against foreign invaders. During the 20th century the battle was used in Nazi and Soviet propaganda campaigns. Only in recent decades have historians moved towards a dispassionate, scholarly assessment of the battle, <b>reconciling</b> the previous narratives, which differed widely by nation.|$|E

5|$|A loyal clubman, Trumble {{served on}} the {{committee}} of the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) from 1900–01 to 1910–11 and was made a life member in 1904. In 1911 he resigned from the bank to become MCC club secretary; a position he held for 27years until his death. In this role, he played a leading part in <b>reconciling</b> the club and the Victorian Cricket Association {{after a period of}} some friction between the two bodies. He was instrumental in attracting quality cricketers to the club including Bert Ironmonger, whom Trumble saw play on a visit to Queensland.

5|$|By 1944, Skelton {{was engaged}} to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had {{obtained}} a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied {{that the reason for}} the breakup was Edna's continuing to manage her ex-husband's career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting {{in the middle of the}} relationship or <b>reconciling</b> with her former husband.|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Sitting Bull {{was allowed}} to leave the {{reservation}} to go Wild Westing with Buffalo Bill Cody’s Buffalo Bill's Wild West. He earned about $50 a week for riding once around the arena, {{where he was a}} popular attraction. Although it is rumored that he cursed his audiences in his native tongue during the show, the historian Utley contends that he did not. Historians have reported that Sitting Bull gave speeches about his desire for education for the young, and <b>reconciling</b> relations between the Sioux and whites. The historian Edward Lazarus wrote that Sitting Bull reportedly cursed his audience in Lakota in 1884, during an opening address celebrating the completion of the Northern Pacific Railway.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Henry's {{coronation}} Gerard {{was appointed}} to the recently vacant see of York, and became embroiled in the long-running dispute between York and the see of Canterbury concerning which archbishopric had primacy over England. Gerard managed to secure papal recognition of York's claim to jurisdiction over the church in Scotland, but he was forced to agree to a compromise with his counterpart at Canterbury, Anselm, over Canterbury's claims to authority over York, although it was not binding on his successors. In the Investiture Controversy between the king and the papacy over the right to appoint bishops, Gerard worked on <b>reconciling</b> the claims of the two parties; the controversy was finally resolved in 1107.|$|E
40|$|The {{processes}} of gene duplication, loss, and lineage sorting {{can result in}} incongruence between the phylogenies of genes and those of species. This incongruence complicates the task of inferring the latter from the former. We describe the use of <b>reconciled</b> trees to reconstruct {{the history of a}} gene tree with respect to a species tree. <b>Reconciled</b> trees allow the history of the gene tree to be visualized and also quantify {{the relationship between the two}} trees. The cost of a <b>reconciled</b> tree is the total number of duplications and gene losses required to <b>reconcile</b> a gene tree with its species tree. We describe the use of heuristic searches to find the species tree which yields the <b>reconciled</b> tree with the lowest cost. This method can be used to infer species trees from one or more gene trees...|$|R

5|$|The Colombian {{tariff system}} {{is defined in}} the Ley de Servicios Públicos or Public Services Law from 1994. It is applied in public, mixed and private companies. The tariff system aims at <b>reconciling</b> the {{achievement}} of cost recovery with {{the protection of the}} poor. The basic tariff is calculated on the basis of economic costs according to a methodology defined at the national level by CRA (Law 287 of 2004). Therefore, in principle, tariffs in different municipalities do not differ due to local government’s decisions to raise tariffs or not, but only because of the different costs of the services.|$|E
5|$|The {{first class}} arrived in fall 1927. The {{incoming}} Experimental College class was more diverse than the larger university's population. One third of students hailed from Wisconsin (as opposed to 90 {{percent in the}} university), most were from urban areas (the East Coast had particularly strong representation), one third were second-generation immigrants, and Meiklejohn estimated their Jewish population at 40 percent. The College was all-male, {{due in part to}} space availability and the regents' refusal of mixed-sex living arrangements, in keeping with American college conventions. The students were largely well-versed in current affairs, with higher scores on entrance exams and lower high school grades than their UW counterparts. Meiklejohn appreciated the challenges of <b>reconciling</b> this diversity and related this task to those facing the country's democratic governance.|$|E
5|$|Troglita did {{not remain}} inactive: from Carthage, the praetorian prefect Athanasius and Troglita's young son {{organized}} reinforcements and {{supplies for the}} camp at Laribus, while Troglita himself succeeded not only in <b>reconciling</b> Cutzinas and Isfidaias, but also in gaining the allegiance of King Iaudas and his tribe. In the spring of 548, Troglita, having regrouped his forces, met with his Moorish allies at the plain of Arsuris on the northern limits of Byzacena. Corippus gives extraordinary numbers for the native contingents provided by each chief: 30,000 for Cutzinas, 100,000 for Isfidaias, and 12,000 under Iaudas's brother. Whatever the real numbers, {{it seems clear that}} Troglita's regular troops formed the lesser portion of the imperial army.|$|E

5|$|After 1555, {{the initial}} <b>reconciling</b> {{tone of the}} regime began to harden. The medieval heresy laws were restored. The Marian Persecutions of Protestants ensued and 283 Protestants were burnt at the stake for heresy. This {{resulted}} in the Queen becoming known as Bloody Mary, due {{to the influence of}} John Foxe, one of the Protestants who fled Marian England. Foxe's Book of Martyrs recorded the executions in such detail that it became Mary's epitaph; Convocation subsequently ordered that Foxe's book should be placed in every cathedral in the land. In fact, while those who were executed after the revolts of 1536, and the St David's Down rebellion of 1549, and the unknown number of monks who died for refusing to submit, may not have been tried for heresy, they certainly exceeded that number by some amount. Even so, the heroism of some of the martyrs was an example to those who witnessed them, so that in some places it was the burnings that set people against the regime.|$|E
5|$|Aldo Rico {{escaped from}} prison in January 1988 and started a new mutiny in a distant {{regiment}} in the northeast. This time, both the military support for the mutiny and the public outcry against it were minimal. The army attacked him, and Rico surrendered after a brief combat. Colonel Mohamed Alí Seineldín launched a new mutiny in late 1988. As in 1987, the mutineers were defeated and jailed, but the military was reluctant to open fire against them. Alfonsín's goal of <b>reconciling</b> the military with the civil population failed, as the latter rejected the military's complaints, and the military was focused on internal issues. The Movimiento Todos por la Patria, a small guerrilla army led by Enrique Gorriarán Merlo, staged {{the attack on the}} Regiment of La Tablada in 1989. The army killed many of their members, and quickly defeated the uprising.|$|E
