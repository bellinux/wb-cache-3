50|$|These {{evolved from}} the front-engine rear-wheel drive layout. A new form of {{transmission}} called the transfer case was placed between transmission and final drives in both axles. This split the drive to the two axles and may also have included reduction gears, a dog clutch or differential. At least two drive shafts were used, one from the transfer case to each axle. In some larger vehicles, the transfer box was centrally mounted and was itself driven by a short drive shaft. In vehicles {{the size of a}} Land Rover, the drive shaft to the front axle is noticeably shorter and more steeply articulated than the <b>rear</b> <b>shaft,</b> making it a more difficult engineering problem to build a reliable drive shaft, and which may involve a more sophisticated form of universal joint.|$|E

In the middle and rear neck vertebrae, the laminae spinopostzygapophyseales or SPOLs, ridges that run from the rear joint processes to the neural spine, thicken towards the rear {{near the top of the}} spine. In the third metacarpal of the hand, the ridge that runs along the inner rear corner of the shaft, if the bone is held vertically, splits at about a quarter of the shaft length measured from the top, the outer branch having the form of a bulge. The fourth metacarpal has a flange along the top third of the inner rear corner.

5000|$|In 1723 Paul Jacob Marperger, {{who later}} became the Electoral Saxon Kommerzienrat {{described}} a proposal by mathematics professor, Nicolaus Molwitz from Magdeburg, to use mechanical assistance in order {{to cope with the}} fast currents below Magdeburg's bridges. At that time, 50 men were needed to negotiate this section of the river. The idea was to build a 'machine' with two horizontal shafts, the towing cable being turned around the front shaft {{in such a way that}} it was continuously being unwound from it again and onto the <b>rear</b> <b>shaft.</b> According to Marperger, with the additional use of levers it should have been possible for five or six men to successfully effect the passage of the boat. At the same time, however, he stressed that the machine was [...] "produced" [...] but [...] "never taken into use". From his description, elements of this basic principle seem to be similar to those subsequently used later in building chain boats. This section of river was later to become the starting point for the first chain boats in Germany.|$|E

All tests were conducted at a Mach number of 0. 70, at angles of attack of approximately - 2 to + 4 deg, and at a Reynolds number of 3. 82 million based on the wing chord of 13 inches. The data indicate that, as a result of locating the propeller behind the wing trailing edge, at the wingtip, in the cross flow of the tip vortex, it is possible to recover part of the vortex energy as an increase in propeller thrust and, therefore, a reduction in the lift-induced drag as well...|$|E
40|$|This {{document}} {{is about the}} design and construction of a two-axle trailer with three doors, uncovered and provided of front articulation, the trailer is designed for 2 tons of load capacity, built with metal structures selected according to the typical calculations required {{for this type of}} constructions. For its manufacture new materials were used except for the <b>rear</b> <b>shaft</b> for the set of wheels of the trailer where a differential gear with load capacity of 2, 5 tons was adapted, the front shaft is built with a steel pipe of Schedule 40 because the design does not allow another differential gear. For the design work, construction manuals for materials were used, in order to perform strength of materials calculations. This trailer is built with UPN structural shapes which are hot rolled material; this material was selected for its composition itself as it has the right characteristics to withstand static and dynamic loads. Especially this material was used for the base of the trailer. The structure of the trailer has a special design on the front axle of the wheels {{to have the ability to}} rotate 15 degrees to the left and right in order to facilitate the rolling in the curves of the routes. The idea of building the trailer came from the Master Edwin Tamayo, who is the director of the Institute of Technology at ESPOL who manages an agreement ESPOLAMAZONÍA in the province of Pastaza, agreement that carries out a project of cultivation of plants that are in danger of extinction and this is the need to build a trailer to transport agricultural products to the working areas, such as plants, fertilizers and tools needed for development work...|$|E

5000|$|For the 1999-2004 Jeep Grand Cherokees {{using the}} NV247 {{transfer}} case, in [...] "4-All Time" [...] mode torque {{is applied to}} only the rear wheels under normal driving conditions. A gerotor pump is connected between the front and <b>rear</b> output <b>shafts</b> and senses any speed difference between them. When the shafts are turning at different speeds (wheel slippage), the pump supplies oil under pressure to a wet clutch pack. The clutch pack applies progressive 0 to 100% locking between the front and <b>rear</b> output <b>shafts.</b> For example, if the rear axle starts rotating at a significantly higher rate than the front axle, the gerotor pump causes the clutch pack to progressively lock, transferring torque to the front axle until both axles are driven at the same speed. The apply pressure in the clutch pack bleeds off slowly, which progressively unlocks the clutch pack and biases torque output towards [...] "rear only" [...] unless the rear wheels are still slipping. There is no center differential, so on dry pavement the front and <b>rear</b> output <b>shafts</b> cannot be locked without causing driveline binding. The [...] "N" [...] or neutral mode is intended for towing the vehicle. In [...] "4-Lo" [...] mode, the input shaft drives through a 2.72:1 reduction planetary gear set and {{the front and rear}} axles are locked together through the clutch pack. This same NV247 transfer case is the foundation for the Quadra-Drive system described below.|$|R

(Hårdvaruberoende reglering av fyrhjulsdrift) Haldex Traction AB {{designs and}} manufactures an {{all wheel drive}} system called Haldex Limited Slip Coupling. A slip controller controls the speed differences between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>shafts</b> in the all wheel drive vehicle. The product exists in three generations and a fourth, with some major hardware differences, is under development. The variations in hardware lead to widely different demands on the control software of the slip controller. This master thesis presents a well-founded comparison between Generation I and IV from a control design perspective. Two models were made of the coupling, one for the two generations respectively, and simulated together with a simple vehicle model and a PID controller. The control parameters were tuned for a normal driving condition and then tested for different disturbances. The simulations show that the slip controller in Generation IV can be made faster due to less embedded delay in the coupling. Generation I {{on the other side}} is more robust to changes in friction between the tyres and the surface and is more stable for time delays from the CANbus...|$|R

50|$|The Command-Trac {{transfer}} case has four positions: 2-HI, 4-HI, Neutral, and 4-LO. The lever {{is placed in}} 2WD HI for regular driving. This allows the two rear tires to receive power. The second position, 4WD HI, is used for driving on slippery or loose surfaces. This position locks both the front and <b>rear</b> drive <b>shafts</b> together allowing the vehicle to maintain drive as long as at least one axle has traction. The third position, Neutral, disengages both drive shafts from the {{transfer case}} allowing the car to roll freely; this is used for towing behind another vehicle, for example. The last position, 4WD LO is used for situations requiring higher torque or slow speed when traversing rough terrain. A common misconception is that 4WD LO provides more traction. It only changes the gear ratio and does not add any more friction between the tires and the driving surface. This position, like 4WD HI locks both the front and <b>rear</b> drive <b>shafts</b> together, and by using a lower gear ratio, allows for 2.72 times more torque (however, the speed is limited to around 25 MPH max). It {{should be noted that}} turning while in 4WD HI or LO on dry pavement is hazardous to vehicle components, through driveline binding and wheel-hop.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{development}} and the experimental testing of a magnetorheological coupling for a 4 WD vehicle are presented. Unlike most of the active devices use multidisc wet clutches as engagement mechanism, this device {{does not have any}} sliding contact and is characterized by an electrical actuation mechanism. The coupling performance is obtained by means of the magnetorheological fluid (MRF), able to change its rheological behaviour when a magnetic field is applied. Therefore the supply current control allows to manage the torque transmitted to the <b>rear</b> drive <b>shaft.</b> So this device can be used to bias the drive torque between the front and <b>rear</b> drive <b>shafts</b> of a 4 WD vehicle. In particular the magnetorheological fluid (MRF) employment allows to realize an adaptive system able to improve vehicle directional behaviour and traction. An MRF coupling model and its control logic have been developed and are described. The results of the simulations carried on with these models are reported; they have shown the feasibility of this application in terms of torque transmission and biasing. The above simulation models have been implemented in a Software-In-the-Loop (SIL) scheme together with a vehicle dynamics model. The SIL results are reported and they show the MRF coupling effectiveness on the vehicle dynamical behaviour. A test bench has been realized to test an MRF coupling prototype in order to verify the capability to transmit torque...|$|R
