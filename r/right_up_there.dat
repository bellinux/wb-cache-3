[...] "A {{lot of people}} doubted my dad's abilities, and Kevin's had doubters and naysayers," [...] Dodd commented. [...] "But both [...] {{were willing to take}} risks, and both were very resilient. My dad would always try new things. You could never pin him down. Kevin's career is similar." [...] David Evanier, author of Roman Candle: The Life of Bobby Darin (...) , said [...] "You can put Kevin's obsessiveness about getting the film made <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with Bobby's obsessiveness. He's also the ideal person to play Bobby. He has an uncanny physical resemblance to him, and he also has Bobby's intensity and dark side. Also, there's the connection with his mother. Bobby's mother's belief in him sent him soaring. Kevin's mother wanted him to make this film. Kevin sees the film as an act of devotion to his mother." ...|$|E
500|$|Sheen {{played the}} title role in Hamlet at the Young Vic in late 2011 and early 2012, a role he first {{explored}} in a 1999 BBC Radio 3 production. While there had been tentative plans over the years for both Peter Hall and Michael Grandage to direct Sheen in the play, he eventually asked Ian Rickson. Rickson's production was set in the secure wing of a psychiatric hospital and featured original music by PJ Harvey. The Evening Standard declared Sheen's performance [...] "an audacious achievement" [...] that [...] "will live in the memory" [...] while The Independent praised [...] "a recklessly brilliant and bravura performance." [...] The Telegraph felt that Sheen [...] "could be <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> among the great Hamlets" [...] while The Times found him [...] "unbearably moving". The Guardian described him as [...] "fascinating to watch ... intelligent, inventive and full of insights ... delivers the [...] "What {{a piece of work}} is man" [...] passage with a beautiful consciousness of human potential."

500|$|... "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] has {{garnered}} positive {{reviews from}} both film and music critics, {{some of whom}} even identified it as the film's best song. Aja Romano of The Daily Dot hailed the song as Hercules highlight that [...] "satisfies us every time". Writing for Indiewire, Greg Ehbar cited [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] as his favorite, describing the song {{as one of the}} film's [...] "truly great tunes". Ella Ceron of Thought Catalog called the song [...] "a pop song made on Olympus." [...] Irving Tan of Sputnikmusic was especially kind towards the song, which he hailed as [...] "the ultimate pantheon of Grecian achievement". Tan continued, [...] "the five Muses prov that their pillow talk skills are <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with the best of them", concluding, [...] "The track also works well as an alternative to modern pop's teenage heartbreak music ... be sure to ditch Hilary Duff and play this instead". Tracy Dye of Bustle hailed the song as [...] "one of Disney's most addictive pieces of ear-candy," [...] appreciating the fact that [...] "it veers from the typical love-laced ballads we're used to." [...] Rob Burch of The Hollywood News called [...] "I Won't Say (I'm in Love)" [...] a [...] "refreshing change of pace".|$|E
500|$|He made a full {{recovery}} from his injuries in time for Born in the U.S.A. (1984), which featured an aerobics-timed beat on some tracks that also owed something to the popular Phil Collins drum sound. [...] Weinberg's own experimentation since the Darkness days had also led to a more reverberant sound. Overall, Weinberg's more fluid drumming combined with Roy Bittan's use of synthesizers and better overall production to give Springsteen a more modern sound, resulting in the album becoming Springsteen's best-selling one ever and spawning a record-tying seven Top 10 hit singles. Springsteen later said of the album, [...] "Max {{was the best thing}} on the record." [...] Weinberg's most well-known drum part came on [...] "Born in the U.S.A.", where his snare drum paired against Bittan's signature synthesizer riff on the opening and throughout {{the main part of the}} song. The recording then descends into improvised chaos; Springsteen had told Weinberg, [...] "When I stop, keep the drums going." [...] Upon the restart, intentional drum breakdowns matched bass swoops and guitar feedback; Springsteen subsequently said of the performance overall, [...] "You can hear Max – to me, he was <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with the best of them on that song." [...] Weinberg said it was one of his most intense musical experiences.|$|E
500|$|Mike Joyce of The Washington Post {{wrote that}} [...] "Amish Paradise" [...] was [...] "by far the cleverest and funniest track that Bad Hair Day {{has to offer}} [...] it ranks <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with such Yankovic {{classics}} as 'Another One Rides the Bus,' 'Smells Like Nirvana' and 'Eat It.'" [...] He also enjoyed [...] "Gump", but felt that {{the remainder of the}} parodies were weak, particularly citing [...] "Cavity Search" [...] as [...] "a sophomoric attempt to extract yuks". However, Joyce noted that [...] "some of the biggest laugh-getters" [...] on the album were Yankovic's originals. A record review from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette concluded that [...] "'Weird Al' Yankovic's ninth collection of original songs and parodies reinforces his reign as pop music's King of Comedy", and that the record [...] "showcases Yankovic's unparalleled ability to capture the styles of other bands and turn boring pop songs into fun tunes." [...] J.D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun noted that while Yankovic's music can be [...] "sophomoric and silly", Yankovic himself [...] "can also be pretty smart". The review highlighted, among other songs, [...] "The Alternative Polka" [...] and [...] "The Night Santa Went Crazy", as some of the album's best songs.|$|E

So Terry contacted John Rotella, who had worked at Polydor when the Badlees were signed and was himself a casualty of the Seagrams sale. Rotella was now at a label called Ark 21, owned by Miles Copeland III, who had previously been phenomenally successful with I.R.S. Records.

500|$|... "Mothers of the Disappeared" [...] was favourably {{received}} by critics. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe called the song [...] "powerful" [...] {{and described the}} backing vocals as tender and choirlike. Don McLeese of the Chicago Sun-Times {{described it as a}} [...] "hymn to human rights". Adrian Thrills of NME called it [...] "a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness". Nicholas Jennings of Maclean's felt that it was The Joshua Trees [...] "most topical song". Music journalist Andrew Mueller felt the track was a [...] "wilfully downbeat finale". In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond said [...] "'Mothers of the Disappeared' is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is soothing and restorative—music of great sadness but also of unutterable compassion, acceptance and calm." [...] Lennox Samuels of The Dallas Morning News stated that there was [...] "an ineffable sadness in Bono's vocals and images where 'Night hangs like a prisoner / Stretched over black and blue'", calling it [...] "a moving tribute" [...] to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict. He added [...] "hat's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains eerily cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and absolution." [...] In 2006 Bono described it as [...] "a beautiful end to the album", saying, [...] "That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> for me," [...] and noting that it is a song [...] "I'm very proud of to this day." ...|$|E
500|$|The musical {{covers and}} {{performances}} for the episode were mostly well received by critics and fans alike. Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly stated that her favorite was [...] "Silly Love Songs" [...] by Paul McCartney, {{performed by the}} Warblers. In {{a review of the}} performance, she wrote, [...] "This is much more Warbler-esque than 'When I Get You Alone'. I had also been worried we wouldn't get our weekly dose of dorky Warbler dance moves. Plus, major points for the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment when Blaine sang the love 'won't come at all' line to Santana. It was probably my personal biggest laugh-out-loud moment of the episode." [...] She gave the performance an [...] "A". She also praised Puck's performance of [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", and opined, [...] "In general, I'm in love with Mark Salling's voice. He's <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> with Artie [...] in my book. And this song was smothered in awesome sauce. Bonus points for Puck's sort-of-feminine head bob, Brittany's background groovin', the club's reactions to him singing to Lauren, and Mr. Schu's mild eye-roll." [...] She went on to give the performance an [...] "A−". Kristin Coachman of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer was a bit more critical of Puck's cover of the song: [...] "This week Mark Salling [...] is singing Queen's 'Fat Bottomed Girls'. I know this song fits in with Puck's storyline for the episode, but I feel like the song was in the wrong key for him. At times it sounded like he was straining to hit the higher notes. Because of this, I have to wonder if the backing vocals are purposely drowning his voice out. It seems depending on the song selection for him, Salling's vocal performances continue to be very hit or miss this season." ...|$|E
500|$|Yankee outfielder Bob Cerv {{recalled}} of the rivalry, [...] "I {{always remember}} the games when Pierce and Ford would lock up. Those were great ballgames – 2–1, 3–2. Usually, if they'd get beat, Mantle would {{hit a home}} run." [...] New York outfielder Hank Bauer noted, [...] "The guy who gave me the most problem – I know he gave 'em to me, and I think he gave 'em {{to most of us}} – was Billy Pierce." [...] Tommy Byrne, who pitched for the Yankees for most of his career from 1943 to 1957 but played for Chicago {{for the first half of}} the 1953 season, said, [...] "Pierce was sneaky fast, a good breaking ball. He was tough. For several years there he was <b>right</b> <b>up</b> <b>there</b> on a par with Ford." [...] Sportswriter Bill Madden recalled in 1982, [...] "Always it was Pierce against Whitey Ford and always, to me, that seemed like an unfair matchup. They were your classic 'stylish' left-handers, equal in guile and guts, but Ford had those howitzers of Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Bill Skowron and Hank Bauer behind him, while Pierce came armed with popguns. Nellie Fox, Luis Aparicio and Minnie Miñoso supported him with hustle and chink singles and I always marveled at the fact that Pierce could duel Ford on even terms despite those odds." [...] Ironically, the Yankees tried to acquire Pierce in the early 1950s when Ford was in the military, but White Sox general manager Frank Lane proposed that New York give up Bauer, first baseman Joe Collins and second baseman Jerry Coleman in exchange for Pierce and outfielder Al Zarilla, and ended talks when Yankees GM George Weiss suggested the Yankees send minor leaguers instead.|$|E
