40|$|Abstract — Bandwidth {{utilization}} is {{an important}} factor to improve the network performance. For the effective utilization of bandwidth, pathloss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency should be measured. So that the application can adapt its send rate to the estimated bandwidth. To measure the path loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency between two nodes in a college campus network active measurement techniques are used. These techniques do not require prior knowledge about the network topology. The drawback of these techniques is that every device in the network must be configured to estimate the bandwidth measures like path loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency. In this paper, we propose an SDN framework for estimating the pathloss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency. This framework includes features such as detecting path loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> measuring the latency in a college campus network. By deploying this method the loss <b>rate</b> <b>and</b> latency can b...|$|R
