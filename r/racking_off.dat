50|$|A {{process in}} which yeast is added to wine that has {{completed}} primary fermentation. This secondary yeast addition typically remains in the wine from two to eight weeks, depending on the wine maker's goals. The yeast is stirred (bâtonage) frequently during the protocol, and <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> when the protocol is complete. Also known as secondary autolysis, a light lees protocol releases additional mannoproteins and polysaccharides that can influence the flavour and mouth feel of the wine.|$|R

50|$|In most vintages, Château Fortia {{will produce}} a white and three red blends under the Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC. The red grapes are usually destemmed and {{fermented}} separately in 150 hectoliter sized concrete tanks that are temperature controlled. After around three weeks of maceration and alcoholic fermentation, the wines are pressed and transferred to smaller 20-40 hl concrete tanks for malolactic fermentation and then <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> the lees. Finally the separate wines are blended into the cuvee and placed in large oak foudre barrels where they age for 12-18 months before being fined and filtered prior to bottling.|$|R

2500|$|Winemakers {{differ in}} when they choose to {{inoculate}} their must with LAB, with some winemakers pitching the bacteria {{at the same time}} as the yeast, allowing both alcoholic and malolactic fermentations to run concurrently, while some wait till the end of fermentation when the wine is <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> its lees and into barrel, and others doing it somewhere between. For practitioners of minimalist or [...] "natural winemaking" [...] who choose not to inoculate with cultured LAB, malolactic fermentation can happen at any time depending on several factors such as the microbiological flora of the winery and the competing influences of these other microbes. All options have potential benefits and disadvantages.|$|R
2500|$|The {{expression}} [...] "bright beer" [...] {{is commonly}} used, particularly by older established breweries, for any filtered and pasteurised beer. [...] However, the expression [...] "re-racked beer" [...] should {{be reserved for}} beer which has been <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> (decanted) from a cask of cask-conditioned beer immediately before delivery to the venue {{where it will be}} served. [...] It is often regarded as [...] "real ale" [...] because it does still contain some residual yeast, albeit a very small amount, and is otherwise handled exactly as is real ale. [...] Because there is only a very small amount of yeast, there is very little secondary fermentation, and re-racked beer has a very short shelf life of two or three days.|$|R

50|$|The raw {{material}} comes {{from any of}} the red and white grapes of the region, particuiarly damaged bunches, and may include the pomace left over from normal winemaking. Thus it is a way to ensure that none of the harvest is wasted. This material is crushed and cooked in a large cauldron over a fire for 24 hours, which gives its characteristic aromas. Traditionally two men attended it, taking turns to sleep and constantly stirring and skimming off the scum that formed on the surface. The wort is cooked until a half or a third of the volume remains, depending on how sweet it is to be. In the Marche some add a quince for every quintal of must to flavor the drink. Once cooled, the must is transferred to oak or chestnut casks where it is left to ferment. It is <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> the lees once or twice.|$|R
40|$|Brettanomyces bruxellensis and the {{consequences}} of its development in wines are a continuous threat for wine quality. In this context, chitosan of fungal origin was introduced as a new tool to control B. bruxellensis in the context of winemaking. Recent studies have showed the impact of a fungal origin chitosan application on wines contaminated with B. bruxellensis, leading to the elimination of B. bruxellensis cells. In these studies, the chitosan preparation was added, the wine <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> after 10 days and the efficiency of the treatment was evaluated in a short delay after the treatment. This study focused on the evaluation of the impact of different addition protocols of an enological chitosan preparation on B. bruxellensis population evolution and volatile phenols content along the aging, up to 9 months. The results confirm the interest of fungal origin chitosan as a preventive tool to control B. bruxellensis in the context of wine aging...|$|R

25|$|The {{generally}} hot {{climate of}} the Barossa Valley usually means that the grapes become ripe very easily {{with high levels of}} sugars and low levels of acids. Winemaking in the Barossa Valley often utilizes the process of acidification in order to add balance to the wine. The high alcohol levels from the fermented sugars may be offset by various winemaking practices including reverse osmosis and adding water to the must. Historically, winemakers in the Barossa Valley have utilized very short maceration periods that limit {{the amount of time that}} the wines spends in contact with the skin. Often the wine is <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> the skins into oak wine barrels before fermentation is even completed. While this does mean that supplemental tannins might need to be added, this short maceration often leaves the wines with a smooth mouthfeel. The extensive use of oak is also a characteristic of Barossa Valley winemaking with American oak, with its more aggressive dill and coconut aroma notes, often used more than French oak.|$|R

50|$|Williams then {{received}} a wildcard {{in to the}} Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships, which saw her return to the tournament for the first since the 2009 edition of the championships. Williams being the top seed {{received a}} bye through the first round. In the second round she faced Ekaterina Makarova. Although the Russian served for the first set, Williams broke back to force a first set tiebreak. After saving two set points and winning the first set, Williams <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> six straight games to win the match and advance. In the quarterfinals she faced long-time rival Jelena Janković. Despite winning comfortably in straight sets, Williams exchanged words with Janković in the final service game of the match over how quickly the Serb was serving. In the final four, Williams faced Alizé Cornet. Williams kept the first set on serve until being broken in the eleventh game. Williams was unable to create a break point and lost the set in the following game. Following an immediate break {{at the start of}} the second set, Williams converted her sole break point of the match in the fourth game to level. However it wasn't enough as Cornet broke for a third time at 3-3 with a forehand passing shot winner. The French No. 1 held her nerve and served out the match to love to get her first win over a world No. 1.|$|R

5000|$|The Red Line stop at Addison is {{less than}} one block east of Wrigley Field. (The stadium was {{originally}} built for proximity to the train tracks.) At the conclusion of games, the scoreboard operator raises {{to the top of}} the center field scoreboard either a white flag with a blue [...] "W" [...] to signify a Cubs victory or a blue flag with a white [...] "L" [...] for a loss. This is done to show the outcome of the game to passengers on passing [...] "L" [...] trains, and also to anyone passing by the park. Interestingly, the basic flag color was once the exact opposite of the colors used today (the rationale being that white is the traditional color for surrender). In addition to rail service, the CTA provides several bus routes which service Wrigley. CTA bus routes #22 Clark, #152 Addison and #154 Wrigley Field Express all provide access to the ballpark. Pace also operates the #282 Schaumburg-Wrigley Field Express from Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg and the #779 Yorktown-Wrigley Field Express from Yorktown Shopping Center in Lombard. Biking to the field is also a popular alternative. As Halsted, Addison, and Clark streets all have designated biking lanes, getting to the field via bicycle is a widely used way to avoid hectic pre- and postgame traffic; Wrigley Field offers a complimentary bike check program to accommodate for them. Cyclists may check their bikes up to 2 hours before games at the bike <b>racks</b> <b>off</b> of Waveland Ave, and may pick up their bikes up to one hour after games end.|$|R

30|$|The primary {{fermentation}} {{was initiated}} {{by the addition of}} the starter culture. The must was stirred every 12  h with subsequent reading of the specific gravity, pH, temperature and alcohol content for 4  days. After 4  days, the wine was racked into the secondary fermenter. The secondary fermentation was done in an air tight container in which a tube was passed into a clean bottle containing clean water. The essence was to monitor the course of fermentation. This was allowed until completion of fermentation as was evidenced by lack of the appearance of bubbles in the container usually within 3  weeks. Secondary fermentation was done for 21  days. When fermentation stopped, the wine was promptly <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> the lees ensuring minimum exposure to oxygen. After secondary fermentation, the wines were clarified. The clarification/fining were done using bentonite (a clarifying agent). Exactly 500  g of bentonite was dissolved in two litres of boiling water and stirred properly to a gel form. This was allowed to stand for 24  h. Then 150  g of the gel-like bentonite was transferred into each of the wine followed by stirring to dissolve properly. A small quantity of the mixture was collected in a clean bottle which was covered tightly and was used to monitor the process of clarification. This was done for a period of 3  months. Filtration was done after the wines had completed clarification using muslin cloth, sieve and syphon tubes sterilized by 70  % alcohol. The wines was syphoned into the sieve containing four layers of muslin cloth. The residues were removed and the filtrates were allowed to mature for a period of 6  months before other chemical analysis was carried out.|$|R

50|$|Tile {{tracking}} is {{a technique}} most commonly associated with the game of Scrabble and similar word games. It refers {{to the practice of}} keeping track of letters played on the game board, typically by crossing letters off a score sheet or tracking grid as the tiles are played. Tracking tiles can be an important aid to strategy, especially during the endgame when there are no tiles left to draw, where careful tracking allows each player to deduce the remaining unseen letters on the opponent's final <b>rack.</b> The marking <b>off</b> of each letter from a pre-printed tracking grid as the tiles are played is a standard feature of tournament play.|$|R
30|$|The {{optimization}} problem also includes communication network bandwidth constraints to prevent traffic congestion. We assume that, {{there is no}} communication congestion between the servers located in the same rack because they are connected to their ToR switch with high capacity links. The communications congestion may occur either in the (TORS-CS) links or in PoD links (CS-CS). We assume that a ToR switch will be turned off if none of the servers in that rack are being utilized. Similarly CS in a PoD will be turned off if all the servers connected to its <b>racks</b> are <b>off.</b> We note that an on switch consumes a constant power plus load dependent variable power; the former will {{be referred to as}} static and the latter as dynamic power respectively. We will let PS_ℓ, e^ToRS,PS_ℓ^CS denote static power consumption of a ToR switch on the e’th rack of PoD ℓ, and CS switch in PoD ℓ respectively. Similarly, we will let PD_ℓ, e^ToRS,PD_ℓ^CS denote dynamic power consumption of these switches for per bit transmission rate. We also let PWNIC denote the dynamic power consumption at the network interface card (NIC) of a server for per bit transmission rate.|$|R
50|$|Williams {{returned}} to the Sony Open Tennis as defending champion and as the top seed she received a bye through to the second round where she faced Yaroslava Shvedova. She took the first set in a tiebreak after having to break {{to stay in the}} set. The second set was won more comfortably. In the third round Williams had to overcome an in-form Caroline Garcia. After taking the opening set Garcia fought back and took the second set by the same score. Williams went up an early break in the final set, which despite being interrupted by rain, proved decisive as the world No. 1 did not face a single break point on her serve. Williams then took on fellow American Coco Vandeweghe in the fourth round. Vandeweghe met William's dominant serve with equally big serves of her own, but Williams stepped up her return game taking four of nine break point opportunities created. This win set up a fifth career meeting with fifth seeded Angelique Kerber in the quarterfinals. Williams took the match comprehensively in straight sets, losing only four games. The semifinals saw a rematch of the previous years final against the fourth seed Maria Sharapova. After falling behind 1-4 in the first set, Williams <b>racked</b> <b>off</b> five straight games to take the first set, finishing the set with 11 winners including 5 aces. Again Williams fell behind an early break {{at the start of the}} second set, but the world No. 1 broke back immediately to level. Williams earned the first of two service breaks to take the second set and the match. In the final Williams faced the new world No. 2 Li Na. Much like her semifinal match, Williams had a sluggish start to the opening set, struggling to get her first serve in play. She fell behind to China's No. 1 player, however, Williams regrouped and broke to stay in the first set on her third break opportunity. A quick hold to fifteen followed and Li Na was forced to serve for the set a second time. This time the Chinese player held a set point but Williams saved it with backhand winner down the line. She followed this up by hitting a huge forehand return winner creating another break point to stay in the set, which she eventually took. Williams broke again to come back and take the set. Li Na stopped the loss of six consecutive games by holding serve for 1-1 in the second set. Williams responded by winning the next five games, the match and her seventh Miami title, finishing with 29 winners to 29 unforced errors. This seventh tournament win in Miami put her ahead of Andre Agassi for most Miami titles won by any individual player, male or female.|$|R
40|$|Materials 1. Glass culture tubes {{with metal}} caps and labels - Growth medium, from media room or {{customized}} - Glass pipette tubes - Parafilm ### Equipment 1. Vortexer - Fireboy or Bunsen burner - Motorized pipette - Micropipettes and sterile tips ### Procedure For a typical liquid culture, use 5 ml of appropriate medium. The amount in each tube {{does not have}} to be exact if you are just trying to culture cells for their precious DNA. 1. Streak an agar plate from glycerol stock. Incubate plates until colonies grow. - Most incubations with E. coli take place at 37 °C. Often bacteria with temperature sensitive mutations need to be grown at 30 ° instead. - The reason you need to streak plates is to be certain that you are starting from a single clonal population of cells. In this case, colonies that are picked are assumed to arise from a single cell dividing to form the colony. - Agar plates are just the standard. There are many different plating media that can be used (i. e., blood agar). - Take your plates from the warm room. Take an aliquot of the antibiotic(s), if needed, from the freezer, and set it on the bench to thaw. - Flame a glass pipette, open the bottle of medium and flame the mouth, measure out the amount you need to fill your tubes, flame the cap and recap the bottle as quickly as possible. - Remove the tube cap, flame the top of the culture tube, pipette in 5 ml, flame the top of the tube, and cap it. - Pick up one colony by tapping a small (0. 1 μl) pipette tip (held on a pipette) on the surface of the plate. Uncap a tube, flame the top, tip the tube so as to transfer cells from the pipette tip to the surface of the media without touching the inside of the tube with the non-sterile portion of the pipetter, flame, cap. You can also use a sterile toothpick for transfer. - Often people use just a sterile metal loop (sterile by flaming) to place the colony in the tube. This is because flaming assures the sterility of the loop, whereas disposables such as pipette tips and toothpicks can be contaminated, and cannot be flamed on the spot. - Pipette the desired amount of antibiotic into each tube along the wall. Do not put the non-sterile part of the pipette inside the tube and use a new tip for each tube. - Vortex each tube for 1 - 2 seconds to mix well. - Take the tubes to incubate. Turn the rotating <b>rack</b> <b>off</b> using the dial to decrease the speed. Do not use the switch because the stop will be too abrupt. Add your tubes in a balanced layout. If you have an odd number, use extra empty tubes for balance. Turn the rotation back on to 7 (applies to MIT building 68 5 th floor warm room). *Do not forget to turn the rack back on. * - Incubation once again is often at 37 °C in an incubator or warm room. - Wait overnight or until your cells have reached the desired concentration. - The amount of time you wait depends on the reason for growing the cells. To miniprep plasmid DNA, an overnight culture is sufficient. However, when doing measurements of protein levels, take care to take readings at the same cell culture density each time...|$|R
