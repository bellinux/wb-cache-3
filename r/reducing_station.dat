40|$|Natural gas is {{transferred}} in high pressure by piping system from refiners to city gate stations. For public consumption the gas pressure is reduced in gas pressure reducing stations. The pressure is reduced in regulators {{and leads to}} a sudden drop of temperature and consequently the formation of gas hydrates. Preventing hydrate formation, natural gas is heated by passing through water bath gas heaters. In this study, the thermodynamic efficiencies of water bath gas heaters were conducted. The effect of air-fuel ratio and the flow rate of the fuel on the efficiency of this instrument were studied. Also, the variations of efficiencies versus flame temperature have been considered and the optimum points in each state were obtained. From these comparisons, {{it can be concluded}} that, first law efficiency is suitable meanwhile second law efficiency is very low. The main reason of low second law efficiency is that high availability generation by fuel causes low enhancement in the availability of natural gas, passed through heaters. Also, one dimensional simulation has been employed to compute temperature distribution numerically in whole of a gas pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>station</b> with water bath gas heaters and with shell and tube heaters (inline heaters). Comparison between these two stations show that the gas pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>station</b> with inline heaters is more appropriate than the one with water bath gas heaters. Finally, water bath gas heaters and inline heaters have been studied economically by utilizing energy flow optimization model, EFOM. It is shown that the inline heaters have less cost of heat generation and they are more economical...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAt {{the present}} time in Romania, the {{transition}} from the natural gas transportation system to the distribution system is done only thru the use of pressure reducing stations. Here the pressure drop is usually done by using throttle valves or pressure reducing valves, where the gas energy is spent without doing any work. In this article we propose the use of turbo-expanders in the pressure reducing stations, where the natural gas pressure from the transportation grid is high and needs to drop to lower levels to enter the distribution grids, in this way part of the energy consumed in the compression stations are recovered. The plans are made at this time for a pilot project at the pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>station</b> in the city of Onesti, Bacau County...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper applies a {{recently}} developed optimization method {{to examine the}} design of networks that monitor radiation under routine conditions. Annual gamma dose rates were modelled by combining regression with interpolation of the regression residuals using spatially exhaustive predictors and an anisotropic variogram of the residuals. Locations of monitoring stations were optimized by minimizing the spatially averaged regression kriging standard deviation. Results suggest that the current network design is near optimal in terms of interpolation error in predicted gamma dose rates. When the network was thinned to fewer stations, spatial optimization was more effective at reducing the interpolation error. Given that some EU countries are considering <b>reducing</b> <b>station</b> density in border regions, the analysis reported here {{may be useful in}} guiding which stations can be removed...|$|E

50|$|The MTA {{had tried}} to <b>reduce</b> <b>station</b> agent {{positions}} since full MetroCard vending machine (MVM) deployment in 1997. Agents, whose primary responsibility was selling tokens, now sell MetroCards. However, AFC eliminated long token booth queues, so fewer clerks were needed. Passengers now interact with agents only for requests like mutilated farecards, concessionary fares, or travel directions. Clerks were not cross-trained for AFC maintenance; that function was assigned to turnstile maintainers. The MTA determined that each station required only one full-time booth, serving dominant (or both) travel directions. Some booths were removed altogether because {{it was felt that}} MVMs would be sufficient.|$|R
40|$|Batch model {{lines are}} quite handy when {{the demand for}} each product is medium. However they are {{characterized}} by high work-in-progress inventories, lost production time when changing over models and reduced flexibility {{when it comes to}} altering production rates as product demand changes.

A case study from the automobile industry is used for data collection. A model is developed through use of simulation software. The model is then verified and validated before a detailed bottleneck analysis is conducted. An operational strategy is then proposed for optimal bottleneck management.

40|$|Recently, {{back-pressure}} {{steam turbines}} {{have become the}} focal point in many cogeneration applications. This {{is a result of}} the savings in operating costs associated with the generation of electrical or mechanical power coincident with the economical use of available thermal energy. The benefits and constraints of back-pressure systems, however, are not always readily apparent and may result in the misapplication of this technology. This paper, therefore, will examine new turbine installations and backpressure retrofits and will determine the most economical back-pressure turbine applications. A generalized methodology is highlighted, allowing the reader to readily evaluate and determine the economic justification of back-pressure turbines in many cogeneration applications. The impact on plant energy use and cost is calculated, and the effects of load variation and the value of high-efficiency turbines are discussed. The specific process plant case studies reviewed involve back-pressure turbines of 100 to 5000 hp for mechanical drives, for generator drives, and as pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>station</b> replacements...|$|E
40|$|Dupont's Marshall Laboratory is an {{automotive}} paint {{research and}} development facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The campus is comprised of several buildings that are served by Trigen-Philadelphia Energy Corporation's district steam loop. In 1996 Dupont management {{announced that it was}} considering moving the facility out of Philadelphia primarily due to the high operating cost compared to where they were considering relocating. The city officials responded by bringing the local electric and gas utilities to the table to negotiate better rates for Dupont. Trigen also requested the opportunity to propose energy savings opportunities, and dedicated a team of engineers to review Dupont's steam system to determine if energy savings could be realized within the steam system infrastructure. As part of a proposal to help Dupont reduce energy costs while continuing to use Trigen's steam, Trigen recommended modifications to increase energy efficiency, reduce steam system maintenance costs and implement small scale cogeneration. These recommendations included reducing the medium pressure steam distribution to low pressure, eliminating the medium pressure to low pressure reducing stations, installing a back pressure steam turbine generator, and preheating the domestic hot water with the condensate. Dupont engineers evaluated these recommended modifications and chose to implement most of them. An analysis of Dupont's past steam consumption revealed that the steam distribution system sizing was acceptable if the steam pressure was reduced from medium to low. After a test of the system and a few modifications, Dupont reduced the steam distribution system to low pressure. Energy efficiency is improved since the heat transfer losses at the low pressure are less than at the medium pressure distribution. Additionally, steam system maintenance will be significantly reduced since 12 pressure reducing stations are eliminated. With the steam pressure reduction now occurring at one location, the opportunity existed to install a backpressure turbine generator adjacent to the primary pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>station.</b> The analysis of Dupont's steam and electric load profiles demonstrated that cost savings could be realized with the installation of 150 kW of self-generation. There were a few obstacles, including meeting the utility's parallel operation requirements, that made this installation challenging. Over two years have passed since the modifications were implemented, and although cost savings are difficult to quantify since process steam use has increased, the comparison of steam consumption to heating degree days shows a reducing trend. Dupont's willingness to tackle energy conservation projects without adversely affecting their process conditions can be an example to other industrial steam users...|$|E

40|$|Worldwide {{energy crisis}} makes it {{necessary}} to optimize consumption. One of the fundamental ways to reduce energy consumption is recovery from wasted energy. This can be applied in oil, gas and petrochemical industries in which large amounts of energy waste occur. We can refer to gas transportation {{when there is a}} pressure reduction at natural gas pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>stations.</b> In common classic methods, this reduction is accomplished through regulators or throttle valves which the great amount of energy existing in pipelines lost by them. In this paper, it has been suggested to use expansion turbine for achieving pressure reduction, as well as energy recovery goals. In this regard, Tehran City Gate Station No. 2 {{which is one of the}} large natural gas pressure <b>reducing</b> <b>stations</b> in Iran (both from capacity and inlet pressure perspectives), has been selected as a case study. In first step waste of energy was calculated by using exergy analysis and in second step, by using expansion turbines that are used parallel in the station for achieving the goals of gas reduction pressure and power recovery was simulated in four scenarios by Thermoflow 1 software. The results show undeniable fact that the Energy loss at this station has been 38, 443, 578 KWhr for a year. As a result of using turboexpander, the exergy recovery will be 96 %. At the final step, one scenario was selected as the best which its period of payback was about 2 years...|$|R

50|$|Another {{consideration}} was {{the cost}} of the stations, which was a factor {{of the size of the}} trains. In order to <b>reduce</b> <b>station</b> costs, and {{the cost of}} elevated tracks, the trains would have to be smaller than a normal subway. Finally, to reduce operating costs, the system should be completely automated and have as few moving parts as possible. The new system would be aimed at ridership levels above that of buses, about 5,000 passengers per hour per direction (PPHPD), and subways, at 25,000 PPHPD and over. The result was the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS) concept, aimed at ridership levels between 4,000 and 20,000 PPHPD.|$|R
