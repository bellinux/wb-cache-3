25|$|CBC's {{games are}} no longer {{produced}} by CBC Sports and Rogers sells all advertising during the telecasts, but CBC is still provided with advertising time for its own programming. While CBC did not pay a rights fee to either Rogers or the NHL, the public broadcaster does not receive any revenue from the telecasts, aside from payments by Rogers for its use of certain CBC personalities and ancillary staff, and its rent of studio space. In order to assign responsibility for {{the content of the}} telecasts, compliance with <b>regulatory</b> <b>guidelines,</b> and advertising to Rogers, its NHL telecasts on CBC are legally considered to be broadcast by a part-time television network owned by the Sportsnet subsidiary, which is affiliated with CBC's English-language television stations.

Safety standards against earthquakes, tsunamis and other disasters would be revised with the new knowledge and technology in protective measures.

25|$|CBC {{does not}} pay any rights fees to Rogers or the NHL; however, Rogers assumed {{responsibility}} for production and all advertising sales during the telecasts. CBC does not receive any advertising revenue, although Rogers agreed to include promotions for CBC programming in its Hockey Night telecasts on the network, and the corporation still receives some revenue from Rogers for its use of CBC-employed production staff and personalities during the games (such as producers Joel Darling and Sherali Najak), along with its rent of offices and Studio 41 of the Canadian Broadcasting Centre for both Hockey Night and Sportsnet's overall coverage. Hockey Night in Canada had been a financial boon for CBC Television, which by one estimate received half of its total advertising revenue from the broadcasts.

40|$|This thesis has {{examined}} selected federal legislation, presidential executive orders, and <b>regulatory</b> agency <b>guidelines</b> {{to determine the}} impact {{the federal government and}} its various regulatory agencies have had upon personnel administration in higher education. The federal legislation analyzed in this study is: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII as amended; Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 as amended; Wage and Hour Provisions, Equal Pay Act of 1963 as amended; and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 as amended. The Presidential Executive Order analyzed is # 11246, "Nondiscrimination under Federal Contracts. " The <b>regulatory</b> agency <b>guidelines</b> examined are those promulgated by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The guidelines are the Sex Discrimination Guidelines, Religious Discrimination Guidelines, National Origin Discrimination Guidelines, and the Testing and Selecting Employee Guidelines. The survey instrument measured participants' responses to thirty-seven questions encompassing several phases of the personnel and employment system. The compilation and analysis of the participants' responses clearly support the original hypothesis that the federal government and its various regulatory agencies have had an impact upon personnel administration in colleges and universities.

40|$|Validation of {{analytical}} methods is required {{prior to their}} routine use. In addition, the current implementation of the Quality by Design (QbD) framework in the pharmaceutical industries aims at {{improving the quality of}} the end products starting from its early design stage. However, no <b>regulatory</b> <b>guideline</b> or none of the published methodologies to assess method validation propose decision methodologies that effectively take into account the final purpose of developed {{analytical methods}}. In this work a solution is proposed for the specific case of validating analytical methods involved in the assessment of the Content Uniformity or Uniformity of Dosage Units of a batch of pharmaceutical drug products as proposed in the European or US pharmacopoeias. This methodology uses statistical tolerance intervals as decision tools. Moreover it adequately defines the Analytical Target Profile of analytical methods in order to obtain analytical methods that allow to make correct decisions about Content Uniformity or Uniformity of Dosage Units with high probability. The applicability of the proposed methodology is further illustrated using an HPLC-UV assay as well as a Near Infra-Red Spectrophotometric method. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|AbstractChlorpyrifos was {{selected}} for EPA’s Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program (EDSP) based on widespread use and potential for human and environmental exposures. The purpose {{of the program is}} to screen chemicals for their potential to interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid pathways. A battery of 11 assays was completed for chlorpyrifos in accordance with test guidelines developed for EDSP Tier 1 screening. To determine potential endocrine activity, a weight-of-evidence (WoE) evaluation was completed for chlorpyrifos, which included the integration of EDSP assay results with data from <b>regulatory</b> <b>guideline</b> studies and the published literature. This WoE approach was based on the OECD conceptual framework for testing and assessment of potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals and consisted of a systematic evaluation of data, progressing from simple to complex across multiple levels of biological organization. The conclusion of the WoE evaluation is that chlorpyrifos demonstrates no potential to interact with the estrogen, androgen, or thyroid pathways at doses below the dose levels that inhibit cholinesterase. Therefore, regulatory exposure limits for chlorpyrifos, which are based on cholinesterase inhibition, are sufficient to protect against potential endocrine alterations. Based on the results of this WoE evaluation, there is no scientific justification for pursuing additional endocrine testing for chlorpyrifos...|$|R
