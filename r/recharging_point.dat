30|$|Downstream the PAT, the {{existing}} PRVs {{are still in}} line in the system, both equipped with sectioning valves to permit to by-pass the same or not. While the valve of the DIS 3 will never go into operation, except for conditions of malfunction of the PAT, {{the one on the}} DIS 2 will need to be reprogrammed according to the new pressure range in which to operate, to contain excessive downstream water pressure as above explained. Energy produced by PAT and later addressed into the “Black-box Generator” is then used to supply the <b>recharging</b> <b>point</b> and, in case of excessive energy production or absence of electric request by EVs, to supply a street light near the <b>recharging</b> <b>point.</b> The system supplies in priority the EVs <b>recharging</b> <b>point,</b> if necessary the streetlamp equipped with a daylight detector, and energy in excess will be channeled into the power grid. Moreover, in case of need, the EVs’ <b>recharging</b> <b>point</b> will also be supplied from the grid.|$|E
30|$|Recovering {{the excess}} {{mechanical}} energy in a WDN and converting it into electricity {{to supply the}} <b>recharging</b> <b>points</b> for the EVs {{would lead to a}} double advantage: on one hand, to use energy that, otherwise, would be lost and to the other to induce local administrations to secure agreements with water management authority, to implement incentive policies leading to the generation of a “green & free” <b>recharging</b> <b>points</b> at zero energy cost.|$|R
30|$|However, in {{the next}} few years, the growing number of EVs will {{implicate}} an important impact on the transport sector but also a key role on the power sector with an obvious increase of global power demand. A possible solution to mitigate the latter effect can be to associate a local power generation, such as renewable energy source, to the <b>recharging</b> <b>points</b> for EVs. The possibility of alternative systems for energy production would significantly increase the <b>recharge</b> <b>point’s</b> number, creating the conditions for a greater incentive of the EVs demand and favoring the increase of their circulation especially in urban areas.|$|R
30|$|In this context, {{the focus}} of this work is on {{coupling}} a PAT system for the recovery of excess pressure level in a WDN with a dedicated system that supplies electric energy for the <b>recharging</b> <b>points</b> of EVs.|$|R
30|$|The {{power station}} {{consists}} of a PAT, a “Black-box Generator”, composed by electric frequency converters, and a PLC-based control system {{able to control the}} flow rate regulation valve and the generator itself. The generator, managed by the control system, gives the energy produced by the PAT to the electrical grid with values of voltage and frequency according to the grid standards. This peculiar “generator” system allows to give energy to the electrical grid with any rotational speed of the PAT. Energy produced is then used to supply the <b>recharging</b> <b>point</b> for EVs and/or to supply a street light near the <b>recharging</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

40|$|Cover illustration. <b>Recharge</b> <b>points</b> for {{simulated}} {{particles of}} water within the ground-water flow system of Clark County, Washington, {{based on a}} particle-tracking analysis using MODPATH. The ground-water flow system was represented {{as part of a}} three-dimensional ground-water flow model of the Portland Basin, Oregon and Washington, simulated with MODFLOW, using a grid of 90 columns, 50 rows, and 8 layers. The particles were generated by placing a regularly spaced array of 6 particles per cell, 1 on each cell face within the ground-water flow model that represents Clark County, for a total of about 60, 000 particles, and tracking the particles backwards in time through the simulated flow system. The <b>recharge</b> <b>points</b> are shaded {{on the basis of the}} distance traversed by the particles, with darker shades representing longer distances. Recharge areas for intermediate- and regional-scale flow systems are indicated by a high density of dark <b>recharge</b> <b>points.</b> The results of the particle-tracking simulation were used to evaluate ground-water vulnerability by identifying recharge areas and their characteristics, determining the downgradient impact of land use at recharge areas, and estimating the age of ground water.

30|$|The aim of {{the present}} study is to {{evaluate}} the technical and economic feasibility of supplying recharge points for Electric Vehicles converting water pressure in excess into electric energy from a water distribution network. A real water distribution network was analyzed, by designing a power station consisting of three components: a Pump-as-Turbine, an ad hoc generator, and a control system. The last one controls the flow rate trend at the inlet of the Pump-as-Turbine to regulate the rotational speed corresponding to the optimal range of efficiency. Energy produced permits to supply a <b>recharging</b> <b>point</b> for Electric Vehicles on site with the aim to convert water pressure generally dissipated and, consequently, lost into a renewable energy and to reduce power grid congestion. The economic analysis confirms the convenience of the proposed power station, and overall, a comparable cost with pressure reduction valve devices normally adopted to control pressure pattern and leakages of a water distribution network.|$|E
30|$|A cost–benefit {{analysis}} was conducted using both the statistical method, evaluating the definition of payback period and return of investment (ROI), and the dynamic approach, thanks to net present value (NPV) and Internal rate of return (IRR). The latter, unlike the former, {{take into account the}} total costs and benefits for the entire useful life of the equipment and the moment when the cash inflows occur. A comprehensive cost–benefit analysis must also include the estimation of the environmental benefits and their revenues derived from the use of the PAT, able to dissipate excess water pressure of a WDN and to convert it into electricity, in order to supply a <b>recharging</b> <b>point</b> for EVs. Annual energy production by the PAT system was estimated at 57, 587  kWh/year and the annual revenue for this produced energy was computed as 13, 245 €/year. Moreover, considering the hypothesized useful life, total energy production was at 836, 806  kWh and the relative revue is 198, 675 €. Furthermore, considering the recovery of water losses due to the pressure reduction into the WDN and thanks to the information of the water management company, able to compare the volumes introduced into the network and those invoiced before and after the installation of PRVs, a volume of water savings of about 0.5  Mm 3 /year was estimated. Considering a water tariff of 0.20 €/m 3, a full-recovery cost of water of 100, 000 €/year was obtained.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Geology. Two siliciclastic-filled paleocaverns {{within the}} Mississippian (Osagean) Burlington- Keokuk Limestone, which were formed in pre-Desmoinesian (Middle Pennsylvanian) time, are {{described}} from exposures in Dade County, Missouri. Petrographic and sedimentological analyses {{suggest that these}} cave-fills were derived from terrestrial sources. The age of the cave-fills were determined to be Late Atokan (Lower Pennsylvanian) based on their spore and pollen assemblage. One of the caves examined is filled primarily with coarse to fine-grained sand. Sedimentary structures include plane-beds, cross-stratification, scours, flaser bedding, softsediment deformed layers, flame structures, and normal-graded bedding. Cave-roof collapse and associated boudinage, as well as slack water shales, separate thick sandstone layers. This paleocavern has been interpreted to have been filled by fluviokarst processes with sediment entering primarily through sinking streams. The cave-fill in the other paleocave examined is primarily mudrock, shale, and sandy siltstone with some roof-collapse breccia. These rocks contain abundant organic matter, including wood fragments and charcoal, as well as abundant pyrite and secondary sulfate minerals. This paleocave has been interpreted to have been filled by soil and residuum entering through sinkhole collapses beneath marshes or swamps and by some in-flowing, low-energy water currents. The <b>recharge</b> <b>points</b> of a cave can be inferred {{by the type of}} sediments that it is filled with and <b>recharge</b> <b>points</b> dictate cave geometry. These <b>recharge</b> <b>points</b> can be seen on subsurface maps and an area of possible paleocaves can be drawn between these points.

40|$|AbstractThis paper quantifies the {{recharging}} behaviour of {{a sample}} of electric vehicle (EV) drivers and evaluates the impact of current policy in the north east of England on EV driver recharging demand profiles. An analysis of 31, 765 EV trips and 7704 EV recharging events, constituting 23, 805 h of recharging, were recorded from in-vehicle loggers {{as part of the}} Switch EV trials is presented. Altogether 12 private users, 21 organisation individuals and 32 organisation pool vehicles were tracked over two successive six month trial periods.

40|$|In {{recent history}} {{there has been}} a steady {{increase}} in container traffic worldwide. As a result modern western Container Terminal ports are turning towards automation to raise their productivity, capacity and reliability. Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) are among the most commonly used solutions for horizontal transport within a container terminal. A more recent development in the automated container handling is the use of cassette based or C-AGVs. The latest generation of which provides a zero emission, all electric solution through the use of induction <b>recharge</b> <b>points</b> in the terminal area. The Multi-Agent System (MAS) based simulation model provides a method for evaluating dispatching strategies for this newest generation of C-AGVs. The location and number of <b>recharge</b> <b>points,</b> cassettes, yard and quay cranes as well as the paths containers have to travel are all included in the model. The NetLogo based simulator will be used to compare existing dispatching strategies, modified versions of them, or develop and test new ones. The simulator will also simulate different scenarios, which are described in the later chapters, and can thus be used to determine the best configuration and investment plan in a highly complex domain like a Container Terminal. s_aliowais@hotmail. com, jan. milants@kahosl. be 0046735781720; 00325221386...|$|R
