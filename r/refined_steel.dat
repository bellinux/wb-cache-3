The Charpy V- notch imipact properties have been assessed and related to microstructure. The only significant deterioration in impact properties occurred in the coarse grained HAZ of the aluminium grain-refined steel. The notch- impact properties of the subcrltical weld HAZ have been assessed by simulating specimen blanks with and without notches through thermal cycles reported to cause the greatest degree of subcritical embrittlement in these steels. The results showed that no significant embrittlement occurred in either steel in the absence of notches. In the presence of a notch there was evidence of an increase in transition temperature of 10 35 C in the semi-killed steel but no increase in the aluminium grain-refined steel.

40|$|Abstract: The {{characteristics}} of thermally sprayed WC-Cr-Ni cermet coating under lubricated rolling with sliding contact condition were examined experimentally. Experiments were performed using a two-roller testing machine. The coating was formed onto the blasted or ground roller specimens made of thermally refined carbon steel or induction hardened carbon steel by high energy type flame spraying (Hi-HVOF). A mirror-like finished cermet coated steel roller was mated with a noncoated carburized hardened steel roller. In {{the case of}} thermally <b>refined</b> <b>steel</b> substrate and for the mating surface roughness R max= 0. 1 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed lower durability than that on the blasted substrate. For the mating surface roughness Rmax= 3. 0 µm, coating on the ground substrate showed an extremely short life as compared with that on the blasted substrate. In general, durability of cermet coating was greatly increased due {{to the increase in}} the coating thickness. In the case of induction hardened steel substrate, coating on the blasted or ground substrate showed high durability for both R max= 0. 1 µm and 3. 0 µm. Coefficient of friction and oil film thickness were markedly influenced by the mating surface roughness but these were hardly affected by the substrate material. In addition, depending on the mating surface roughness, significant differences in the surface roughness of coated roller and depth of flaking on the coated roller were found...|$|E
40|$|Steelmaking {{today is}} carried out in batch processes. However, in many {{industries}} {{it has been found}} that continuous processes are more efficient than batch processes. In the 19602 ̆ 7 s it was shown in the WORCRA, IRSID and other trials {{that it is possible to}} produce a high quality <b>refined</b> <b>steel</b> continuously. The WORCRA process utilised counter-current flow of the slag phase with respect to the metal phase. One of the failings of this process that has been cited by others is low productivity. This was due, in part, to low mixing intensity in the melting region of the furnace. The current study is focussed on understanding the relationship between the melting zone mixing intensity and axial dispersion in an attached refining channel for a geometry similar to that of the WORCRA process. An important finding of this work was that changes in the mixing intensity had little effect on the dispersion in the refining channel. Other findings include, (1) there was a decrease in axial dispersion in the launder as the fluid flow rate was increased, (2) tuyère gas injection in the channel had no apparent influence on waves travelling along the channel, and (3) that the discontinuous nature of the ejection of water from the exit of the model was caused by slopping in the melting zone...|$|E
40|$|In a {{world where}} markets are {{characterized}} by ever increasing competition, companies have to focus all of their marketing and sales activities {{in the same direction}} in order to survive. Recent research has shown that for a company to be successful, the marketing and sales functions need to be coordinated. A company with separated marketing and sales departments will have problems competing in today’s market. Marketing and sales functions need to be integrated to some extent in all companies. There are a number of factors identified by researchers as affecting the integration of the two functions. There are also ways to improve the integration by enhancing communication or by physically integrating them. The {{purpose of this study is}} to gain a deeper understanding of the integration of the marketing and sales functions in a company. Two major companies in the <b>refined</b> <b>steel</b> industry situated in Luleå, Sweden, were studied. The findings confirm most of the established theories and describe how sales influence the strategic choices made by the marketing department. It also shows that the integration of the two functions may differ between companies. If the marketing department is well developed, it is more separated from the sales department but also in constant collaboration with them. If the marketing department is smaller, they are more dependent on the sales department and are therefore naturally integrated. The findings further shows that companies that have people with marketing background in their sales department have it easier communicating between departments and prevent conflicts due to misunderstandings.

50|$|The {{electroslag}} remelting (ESR) {{process is}} used to remelt and <b>refine</b> <b>steels</b> and various super-alloys, resulting in high-quality ingots. This process can be started up through vacuum induction melting. The ESR process uses the as-cast alloy as a consumable electrode. Electric current (generally AC) is passed between the electrode and the new ingot, which is formed {{in the bottom of}} a water-cooled copper mold. The new ingot is covered in an engineered slag that is superheated by the electric current. The electrode tip is slowly melted from contact with the slag. These metal droplets travel through the slag to the bottom of the water-cooled mold and slowly freeze as the ingot is directionally solidified upwards from the bottom of the mold. The slag pool floats above the refined alloy, continuously floating upwards as the alloy solidifies. The molten metal is cleaned of impurities that chemically react with the slag or otherwise float to the top of the molten pool as the molten droplets pass through the slag.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyse the technology of making ultra-pure steel intended for casting forging ingots. Forging ingots, whose mass amounts to 8 Mg, are cast using the bottom pouring method after vacuum steel degassing in the ladle. Design/methodology/approach: Data from 24 melts were analysed. Researchers studied not only the final content of oxygen, sulphur and hydrogen after vacuum steel refinement but also the quantitative amount of nonmetallic inclusions in forgings made of ingots. A simulation was also conducted. Its purpose was to assess the optimal share of bauxite in the production of refining slag. The simulation was performed using thermodynamic software called FactSage 5. 5. Findings: Analysing the final concentration of oxygen dissolved in liquid steel led to a conclusion that approx. 90 % of analysed types of steel can be categorized as ultra-pure. The simulation results concerning refining slag formation show that the use of bauxite as a slag forming additive lead to an increase in the liquid phase, and what follows, a decrease in the share of solid precipitations – including the precipitations of lime. Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that all stages of ultra-pure steel production must be conducted conscientiously and meticulously. It is also necessary to improve the conditions of vacuum <b>steel</b> <b>refining</b> process by equipping steelworks with a new vacuum device, e. g. of VOD type. Practical implications: If all stages of steel making are conducted conscientiously and meticulously and the steelworks are equipped with a device for vacuum steel refinement, then the produced steel (from {{the point of view of}} quality) can be competitive in the market of the ultra-pure steel intended for forged products. Originality/value: The simulation results concerning the production of refining slag show that the use of bauxite as a slag forming material leads to an increase in the share of liquid phase. <b>Refining</b> <b>steel</b> under a heating layer contributes to the improvement of steel purity – which is measured by analysing the share of surface nonmetallic inclusions. <b>Refining</b> <b>steel</b> under <b>refining</b> slag with a basic character and physical properties adapted to the temperature close to the liquidus temperature of steel contributes to a decrease in the amount of non-metallic inclusions, a decrease in their size. It can aslo affect the shape of inclusions - making them almost spherical in shape.
