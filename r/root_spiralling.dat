This involves planting forest tree seedlings grown in local nurseries, but technologies to produce quality seedlings are lacking in developing countries. Modern nursery containers used to propagate seedlings have internal-surface barriers (ribs or ridges) or side-slits to prevent <b>root</b> <b>spiraling.</b> These are cost prohibitive or unavailable in developing countries and so polybags (plastic bags) are more commonly used, despite their tendency to produce seedlings with deformed root systems that have less potential to establish on field sites. Discarded plastic bottles, which are readily available worldwide, may be a feasible alternative for seedling propagation. We conducted two experiments to assess the potential of repurposed plastic beverage bottles to grow quality trees: 1) Container Comparison-to evaluate Arizona walnut (Juglans major [Toor. ] Heller) and Afghan pine (Pinus eldarica Medw.) seedling root and shoot development in two plastic bottle types compared to modern nursery containers and polybags, and 2) Bottle Modification-to {{examine the effects of}} <b>root</b> <b>spiraling</b> prevention techniques (side-slits, internal-ridges, and control) and container opacity (green, black, and clear) on Afghan pine seedling morphological attributes. Nursery growth and first-year seedling field performance were evaluated for both experiments. In experiment one, seedlings of both species had fewer <b>spiraled</b> <b>roots</b> in bottle containers compared to polybags.

40|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} {{degradation}} {{is a global}} issue, especially in poor and developing regions of the world. In order to combat deforestation {{it is critical to}} enhance the productivity of forest restoration operations, which often involve planting of nursery-grown forest tree seedlings. Production of low quality stock types with deformed and <b>spiraled</b> <b>root</b> systems is a significant issue hindering successful restoration programs. Polybags (i. e., small plastic bags) are a common container type for seedling propagation in developing countries. However, polybags produce seedlings with <b>spiraled</b> and deformed <b>root</b> systems that reduce outplanting survival and performance. Use of discarded plastic water bottles could be a feasible alternative as a container type for seedling propagation in restoration programs. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} develop technology for repurposing discarded plastic beverage bottles to grow quality native plants, trees and shrubs to benefit agroforestry, reforestation, restoration, and conservation programs. Specific objectives for this study were accomplished in two separate experiments (CHAPTER 2) : 1) Container Comparison Experiment - to compare root and shoot development of seedlings grown in plastic bottles, modern nursery containers, and polybags; and 2) Bottle Modification Experiment - to examine the effects of <b>root</b> <b>spiraling</b> control techniques and container opacity on seedling morphological attributes. ^ In the Container Comparison experiment, seedlings of two species, Afghan pine (Pinus eldarica Medw.) and Arizona walnut (Juglans major [Toor. ] Heller), were grown in four container types; Coca-Cola® beverage bottle (Coke), modern container Deepot™ D 27 (D 27), Polyethylene polybag (polybag), and Sam 2 ̆ 7 s Club® water bottle (Sams). At the first sampling period in August, Arizona walnut seedling shoot height, shoot dry biomass, and root dry biomass were all significantly greater in D 27 containers compared to Coke bottles and polybags, while Sams bottles did not differ among treatments. Afghan pine seedling shoot height was significantly greater for seedlings grown in the Sams bottles compared to polybags, while Coke bottles and D 27 did not differ among treatments. Root fibrosity was greater for seedlings grown in both Coke and Sams bottles compared to D 27 and polybags. Similarly, the number of lateral roots was greater in Coke bottles compared to D 27 and polybag containers. At the final measurement period (November), significant differences among treatments were found for all root morphological responses; for both species, seedlings grown in plastic bottles and modern containers had significantly less <b>spiraled</b> <b>roots</b> compared to the polybag. Seedling shoot and root development in plastic bottles at the end of the growing season was equal to or greater than that of the modern container.

Two neuroradiologists independently evaluated 171 intervertebral discs for herniation or "bulge" and 456 nerve roots for root compression, once after CT and once after MRI. We compared interobserver agreement using the kappa statistic and we performed a paired comparison between CT and MRI. For detection of herniated or bulging discs, we observed no significant difference in interobserver agreement (CT kappa 0. 66 vs MRI kappa 0. 71; p = 0. 40).

The observations were made using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array during a long-term CO line survey of Virgo spirals. The major features are: (1) a nuclear concentration with a radius of r~ 5 '' (390 pc), which is resolved into double peaks, and (2) spiral arms which extend out from the nuclear region. The nuclear component has a mass of 1. 3 x 10 ^ 8 Mo, which corresponds to ~ 3. 5 % of the dynamical mass, and shows a slight non-circular motion. The double peaks are separated by ~ 4 ''. 7.

40|$|Do a {{dominant}} state's policies {{have a greater}} effect on a rising state's threat perceptions or its assessment of the dominant state's resolve? Existing theory, <b>rooted</b> in Jervis's <b>spiral</b> and deterrence models, contends that the answer depends on whether the state has status quo or revisionist intentions. Rising states are typically seen as revisionist, a type of state that {{is said to be}} easily emboldened by conciliation but not easily threatened by competition. This project, on the other hand, argues that rising states - even those with revisionist aims - are more easily threatened than emboldened. Anarchy and uncertainty surrounding the dominant state's intentions give all rising states incentive to be cautious in their assessments. Underestimating threats could leave a rising state more vulnerable to coercion or unprepared for war with a materially stronger dominant state. Rising states, therefore, increase their threat assessments in response to almost any kind of competition by the dominant state. The risks of underestimating the dominant state's resolve are also significant: a resolute dominant state might respond to a challenge with overwhelming force. Therefore, rising states only downgrade their assessments of the dominant state's resolve in the face of very strong signals, such as large, militarily useful concessions. This dissertation tests these competing arguments during periods when Britain was {{a dominant}} state facing a rising, revisionist power - the United States (1837 - 1846) and Wilhelmine Germany (1894 - 1898). Detailed, historical analysis identified each British policy change and assessed the impact on U. S. and German perceptions. The results suggest that existing theory overstates the risks of conciliating rising states and understates the impact that competition has on a rising state's threat perceptions. Rising states may be ambitious, but they do not lose sight of their material weakness, the threats they face, or the limits to what they might gain. by Miranda Priebe. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens BRG 100 {{produces}} secondary metabolites with herbicidal {{activity to}} the grass weeds wild oat, Avena fatua, and green foxtail, Setaria viridis. The green fluorescence protein (gfp) gene was introduced into P. fluorescens BRG 100 from Escherichia coli S 17 - 1 ¥ë via a Tn 5 mini transposon suicide vector system. Colony morphology, growth rate in liquid media, weed biocontrol efficacy (plant growth pouch), carbon utilization (Biolog GN) and root colonization of green foxtail by several P. fluorescens BRG 100 gfp transformants were determined {{to be the same}} as the wild type. Pseudomonas fluorescens BRGgfp- 15 was found to be most similar to the wild-type in all of the above characteristics and was thus used in subsequent experiments. Note: all strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens will be referred to by only their strain throughout (ie. BRGgfp- 15 and BRG 100). It was determined by population dynamics per section of <b>root</b> with <b>spiral</b> plating on culture medium, epi-fluorescence and confocal microscopy that BRGgfp- 15 colonized all areas of the root, but showed a preference for the proximal 1 / 3 section and the seed. In the proximal section the mean number of viable cells per gram dry weight was log 109. 06 and log 109. 31, when applied as liquid inoculum and as the pesta granular formulation, respectively. With liquid inoculum there was only log 107. 53 viable cells/g in the middle 1 / 3 section and log 107. 01 viable cells/g in the distal 1 / 3 section. The number of viable cells/g with pesta granules was log 107. 61 and log 107. 34, for the middle and distal sections, respectively. The root hairs, root tip, and ventral portion of the seed were all areas of heavy colonization relative to the other areas of the root. Survival of BRGgfp- 15 in the pesta formulation was examined in 2 soil types, clay and clay loam, in a thermogradient plate apparatus by a factorial randomized design complete block experiment. The experiment included: 3 - 12 hour diurnal temperature regimes: 5 - 15 ¨¬C, 15 - 25 ¨¬C, and 25 - 35 ¨¬C and 3 moisture levels: 25, 50 and 75 % of soil moisture holding capacity. Sampling was carried out after 0, 14, 28 and 42 days. The highest numbers of viable BRGgfp- 15 cells/g were found in the pesta granules in soil subjected to the lowest diurnal temperature regime and moisture content. The lowest numbers of viable cells/g were found in the pesta granules incubated in the highest diurnal temperature and moisture. This suggests lower soil temperature and moisture enhances survival of BRGgfp- 15 in pesta and/ or higher soil temperature and moisture enhances the release and dissemination of BRGgfp- 15 from pesta granules. When subjected to a 5 - 15 ¨¬C-temperature regime the number of viable cells/g was log 109. 80. When subjected to 15 - 25 ¨¬C the viable cells/g was log 108. 96 and with 25 - 35 ¨¬C it was log 107. 33. The mean number of viable cells/g was log 109. 36, log 108. 86, and log 107. 87, for 25, 50, and 75 % soil moisture holding capacity, respectively. There was also a significantly higher number of viable cells/g in the clay soil collected from Saskatoon, log 109. 00, as compared to the clay loam soil collected from Scott, which was log 108. 40. These results suggest that Pseudomonas fluorescens BRG 100 has considerable potential as a bioherbicide because of its successful root colonization of green foxtail and wheat. Pseudomonas fluorescens BRGgfp- 15 survived well under various environmental conditions when formulated into pesta granules, proving the pesta formulation was an excellent formulation. In addition, gfp was shown to be an excellent conservative marker for monitoring the root colonization and survival of P. fluorescens BRG 100...|$|R

Em 1986, Acianthera e Pleurobotryum passaram a ser considerados subgêneros de Pleurothallis. Estudos moleculares apontaram que Pleurothallis não era um grupo monofilético, e Acianthera passou a ser circunscrito novamente como gênero de Pleurothallidinae. Após recente revisão taxonômica baseada em dados moleculares, Acianthera foi subdividido em dez seções, dentre elas Acianthera seção Pleurobotryae, que engloba as espécies anteriormente pertencentes ao gênero Pleurobotryum. Acianthera seção Pleurobotryae é formada por quatro espécies: A. atropurpurea, A. crepiniana, A. hatschbachii e A. mantiquyrana. Seus representantes apresentam alto grau de diferenciação morfológica, podendo apresentar cauloma ereto, subereto ou pendente, folhas compressas lateralmente ou cilíndricas. Assim, estudos anatômicos dos representantes da seção podem facilitar a caracterização de seus membros, bem como colaborar na compreensão das relações filogenéticas do gênero. Amostras de raízes, ramicaules e folhas de 15 espécies, representantes de oito das dez seções de Acianthera, foram analisadas em microscopia eletrônica de varredura e microscopia de luz. Os estudos anatômicos de órgãos vegetativos e micromorfológicos florais revelaram caracteres anatômicos sinapomórficos para os representantes de A. seção Pleurobotryae: a presença de folhas unifaciais circulares ou elípticas em secção transversal, folhas circulares com feixes {{vascular}}es organizados em círculos concêntricos e mesofilo formado por 28 a 30 camadas de células. Verificamos ainda que as folhas elípticas presentes em A. crepiniana surgiram a partir das folhas circulares presentes nas demais espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae. Em Acianthera foram observados tricomas radiculares simples e espiralados que se originam na camada mais externa do velame e permanecem na raiz mesmo após o seu completo desenvolvimento. Estes tricomas radiculares atuam na adesão da planta ao substrato e na captação de água e nutrientes. A anatomia floral das espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae e de outras espécies analisadas, indica que as pétalas reduzidas destas espécies apresentam um feixe vascular colateral, enquanto que as sépalas e o labelo apresentam três feixes vasculares. Em todos os representantes de A. seção Pleurobotryae, a base e o sulco central do labelo apresentaram células com características de nectários. As sépalas e o labelo de todas as espécies analisadas apresentaram células papilosas e tricomas que podem atuar na emissão de odores. As sépalas apresentam poros estomáticos que possivelmente atuam na liberação de odores e o labelo apresenta diferentes tipos de ornamentações na cutícula, além de poros e rupturas, por onde pode ocorrer a liberação de frangrâncias. A presença de tecidos produtores de néctar no labelo das espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae, é uma característica floral compartilhada entre os representantes desta seção, pois as demais espécies analisadas não apresentaram esta característica. Assim, as espécies de A. seção Pleurobotryae podem atrair os polinizadores pela emissão de odores e recompensá-los produzindo néctar, enquanto que as demais espécies analisadas podem atrair os polinizadores pela emissão de odores e não oferecer recompensas florais.

Abstract: Acianthera {{is formed}} by approximately 291 species of epiphytic and lithophyte plants, in Brazil there are 125 species. In 1986 Acianthera and Pleurobotryum {{came to be}} considered subgenus of Pleurothallis, but molecular studies pointed out that Pleurothallis was not a monophyletic group and Acianthera was again circumscribed as a genus of Pleurothallidinae. After recent taxonomic revision based on molecular data, Acianthera was subdivided into ten sections, among them Acianthera sect. Pleurobotryae that encompasses the species previously belonging to the genus Pleurobotryum. Acianthera sect. Pleurobotryae is formed by four species: A. atropurpurea, A. crepiniana, A. hatschbachii e A. mantiquyrana. Its representatives present {{a high degree of}} morphological differentiation, being able to present erect, subereto or pendent ramicaul, lateral or cylindrical compressive leaves. Thus, anatomical studies of the representatives of the section can facilitate the characterization of its members, as well as collaborate in the understanding of the phylogenetic relationships of the genus. Roots, ramicauls and leaves of 15 species representative of eight of the ten sections of Acianthera were analyzed in Scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy. The study of the vegetative anatomy and floral micromorphology revealed unique anatomical characters for the representatives of A. sect. Pleurobotryae: unifacial leaves, circular or elliptical leaves in cross-section, circular leaves with organized vascular bundles in concentric circles and mesophyll formed by 28 to 30 layers of cells. We also verified that the elliptic leaves present in A. crepiniana appeared from the circular leaves present in the other species of A. sect. Pleurobotryae. In Acianthera, simple and <b>spiraled</b> <b>root</b> trichomes originate in the outermost layer of the velamen and remain in the root even after their complete development. These root trichomes act in the adhesion of the plant to the substrate as well as the water and nutrient uptake. The floral anatomy of the species of A. sect. Pleurobotryae and other species analyzed indicates that the reduced petals of these species present a collateral vascular bundle, whereas the sepals and the lip have three vascular bundles. In all the representatives of the A. sect. Pleurobotryae, the base and the central groove of the lip had cells with nectary characteristics. The sepals and the lip of all the analyzed species presented papillary cells and trichomes that can act in the emission of odors. The sepals have stomatal pores that may act on the release of odors and the lip presents different types of ornaments in the cuticle, as well as pores and ruptures, where the release of frangrances may occur. The presence of nectar-producing tissues in the lip of A. sect Pleurobotryae is a floral characteristic shared by representatives of this section, since the other species analyzed did not present this characteristic. Thus, the species of A. sect. Pleurobotryae can attract pollinators by the emission of odors and reward them producing nectar, While the other species analyzed can attract pollinators by the emission of odors and do not offer floral rewards.

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2012 İnsansız savaş uçaklarının görev zorunlulukları ve ihtiyaçları nedeniyle hareket manevralarının planlanması ve otonomlaştırılması zorunlu bir hal almıştır. Bu amaçla, çalışmada insansız savaş uçaklarının hareket manevralarının aktüatör girişleri ile etkileşimi incelenmiş, hareket modlarının bu eyleyici girişleri ile kontrol edilebilmesi için PID, LQR, kök yerleştirme ve iç-dış çevrim kontrolcüleri tasarlanmış, uçuşta karşılaşılabilecek bozuntuların giderilmesine çalışılmış ve uçuşun otonomlaştırılması amaçlanmıştır. Bu amaçlara yönelik olarak, uçak doğrusal ve doğrusal olmayan hareket denklemleri geliştirilmiş, her iki tip hareket denklemi için eyleyicilerin uçak durum değişkenlerine etkisi gözlemlenmiştir. Bu gözlemlerden hareketle, öngörüldüğü gibi, doğrusal olmayan hareket denklemlerinden belirli varsayımlar ile türetilen doğrusal durum denklemlerinin belirli bir hataya sebebiyet verdiği belirlenmiş ve bu hata miktarı ortaya konulmuştur. Çalışmanın devamında, uzunlamasına ve yanlamasına hareket için LQR, PID ve iç-dış çevrim, durum geri besleme kontrolcüleri ile referans girişe karşılık gelen cevap gözlenmiş, karşılaştırılmış ve gerekli eyleyici girişleri, maksimum ve minimum limitleri göz önüne alınmış ve uçuş otonomlaştırılmıştır. Bu bölüme kadar uçuşun belirli bir kondisyonda gerçekleştirildiği varsayımı ile hareket edilmiştir. Gerçekleştirilen tasarımlar da nominal ölçütlerde düşünülmüştür. Ancak uçak kararlılık türevlerinin uçuş kondisyonuna bağlı olarak değiştiği bilinmektedir. Gerçekleştirilen simülasyonlarla da bu kararlılık türevlerinin uçağı kararsızlaştırabilecek etkilerde bulunabileceği gözlemlenmiştir. Buradan hareketle dayanıklı (robust) bir kontrolcü tasarımı gereksinimi saptanmıştır. Kayma kipli kontrolcü ve dayanıklı PID kontrolcü tasarımları gerçekleştirilmiştir. Bu tasarımların parametrik belirsizliklere ve bozuntulara rağmen kararlı davranış sergilediği görülmüştür. In {{the last}} decades, making {{unmanned}} air vehicle autonomous has gained highly {{importance in the}} point of controlling flight modes especially for fighter aircrafts. From this point, observing and developing of flight maneuver abilities necessity have emerged. On the other hand, precision and effectiveness of developed techniques is very important. In this regard, response of flight modes to actuator inputs for both non-linear and linearized flight equations is a valuable research subject which is worked on in the thesis. The validity of linearized equations is discussed and presented the area which can be accepted to lead these linearized equations. Other important subject is to achieve maneuver abilities {{in the form of}} desired input. Controller design which would provide possible maneuver tasks to the fighter aircrafts on the time of mission is an inevitable necessity. The purpose of maneuver planning and making autonomous unmanned combat air vehicles (UCAV’s) because of flight missions and requirements is in dense in the thesis. All the referred tasks cause some analysis on the field of control engineering. Effects of actuator inputs on flight modes of UCAV’s have been examined and designed PID, Inner loop-Outer loop, Pole Placement and LQR controller techniques. For this sequence, at the beginning, aircraft’s six degree of freedom non-linear dynamic equations have been created. Once non-linear equations, the linearized model is derived from non-linear equations with some assumptions. Defined actuator inputs have effects on state variable of the aircraft. Both non-linear and linear equations bring solution to actuator inputs. From the simulations results, although the same reference input manage the system, linear equations lead some error for the certain flight conditions. On the next step, linearized model is divided by two separated flight which named longitudinal and lateral flights. With the control designs PID, Inner loop-Outer loop, Pole Placement and LQR, response to reference input (desired output) is obtained for the both longitudinal and lateral flights with the allowance of physical limits of actuator mechanisms. Linear model is said to be derived by some assumption. These assumptions include constant stability derivative. But in real flight, stability derivatives are variable parameters and change of at least one state variable would change other derivative values. This fact requires robust stability analysis within the limits of stability derivatives and a robust controller design is an obligation to guarantee stability of aircraft. Main forces which have effects on flight dynamics are classified as aerodynamic forces, thrust force and aircraft weight. By taking consideration of these forces and with the regard of Newton law, we obtain six degree of freedom non-linear equations of aircraft. From this point for the linearization purpose of equations, state variables are classified into longitudinal and lateral flight. So, effects of state variables on each others are cancel out and two separated flights are proceeded. The other assumption is that flight is around a certain trim point and deviations from trim point are not that important to change flight condition and stability derivatives. The other assumption is separating elevator and thrust effects as longitudinal flight inputs and aileron and rudder effects as lateral flight inputs. This means that both linearized systems have multiple inputs. Subsequent assumption is to set beginning rotational rates to zero. So pitch, roll and yaw rates are zero origins. Additionally, roll and yaw angle are zeros as well. Further assumption is the small degree and high perturbations. With all the assumption and defined flight conditions linear model has constructed. The work should be done after that step is to carry out the linear equations to state space model. The aim of this model is to construct a first order differential equation with A system matrix, B input matrix, C output matrix and D feed through matrix. The state space model will help to transition to transfer functions of input-to-output with the Cramer rule and ease the simulation modeling. System variables are chosen among the energy absorbing variables. After eigenvalue investigation and simulation results, it is decided that, in longitudinal flight, all the poles are at the left side of s-plane, so system is stable but there are two poles very close to origin which are needed to be damped faster. 1 degree deflection of elevator input is observed and its causes are negative pitch moment and increment in speed for the steady flight. Thrust increment causes augmentation for speed in short term but in long term its effect is pitch up moment. Simulation results have proved that the aircraft has short term and long term oscillation which must be controlled. In lateral flight 4 roots represent 3 different flight modes. 2 complex conjugate roots represent dutch-roll mode which is defined by the action both rolling and yawing modes, third root represents rolling mode and finally fourth <b>root</b> represents <b>spiral</b> mode. Aileron deflection changes lift forces of two wings in different directions and generate roll moment and additionally it has yawing moment contribution. So dutch-roll mode appears by the side effects. Rudder deflection causes mostly yawing moment but also generates roll moment because of the location of the rudder. The results from analysis and simulations are the needs of a controller design for the stabilization of unstable modes and fast response. Governing the non-linear equations is quite different apart from the linear one. Since the change in control surfaces and state variable situations would change the stability derivative, system may be destabilized. Stability derivatives are defined as functions of high and mach number, so a more complex stability analysis will be required. Comparison of non-linear and linear equations solution includes some basic methods. One is to keep the control surfaces deflected quite short time and small values. By this way stability derivatives will not change highly and response will be very close to linear solution. The other one is the contrarily deflection and response will be very different. This kind of solution would show the validity limits of linear solution. Controller need has been fulfilled by different methods. For the constant parameters using linear model optimal control, modern control and a control theory which is common in aeronautic field named inner loop-outer loop control have been conducted. Linear model which has variable stability derivatives need robust control. Robust stability analysis is also worked on. PID controller which is frequently used for the dynamical systems control and has a wide application area is known its easy design and proper response to systems needs. Direct output feedback and calculated or estimated proportional, integral and derivative constants are sufficient simulation requirements to design this system. Inner loop-outer loop controller is a little bit more complicated than PID controller. Manipulation of longitudinal flight modes with inner loop-outer loop controller design, two flight’s modes will be examined as SISO systems and defined feedback and feed-forward constants. After stabilization the modes system will be converted to MIMO system and output states will be stable and equal to reference input. For the pitch angle, firstly pitch rate is defined as output state. Gyroscope coefficient can be sought by observing root locus as elevator to be input. Pitch rate is now stabilized, next step would be seeking feedback constant of outer loop which will converge the pitch angle to reference input. Loop for speed is provided by throttle input, feedback function is chosen by derivative and proportional constants and loop is completed. Moreover, a feed-forward amplifier using decrements overshoot and shortens peak and settling time. Inner loop-outer loop design gives satisfactory response for longitudinal flight. In inner loop-outer loop control design of lateral flight, yaw angle would be tried to be equal to reference input. For this purpose, firstly steady state value of yaw rate would be equal to zero. Nextly, sliding angle would be minimized by feedback of the mode. Lastly, Aileron input is represented as inner and outer loop feedback of yaw and roll rates. Simulation results shows that such a design worked on achieve to keep pitch angle and speed at desired output. In lateral flight, by inner loop yaw rate is set to zero and by outer loop sliging angle is set to desired output. Additionally, roll rate is set to zero for the stabilization purpose of roll angle. All the required feedback and feed-forward coefficients are found from root locus graphs. Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) is a controller to guarantee asymptotic stability. Riccati equation solution would define state feedback matrix. In order to find proper feedback matrix which provide asymptotic stability some rules must be followed like choice of Q and R matrix. The choice of Q and R matrices would directly affect output matrices, so weight of every element of these matrices should be carefully examined. Pole placement technique is a subject of modern control theory which require to be fully controllable and observable systems to apply the theory. In the case of unobservable system, control system needs an observer to estimate unmeasurable modes of flight. The main purpose of this design is to place the roots to desired points at the s-plane by using state feedback to the input device. That is why all the states need to be known or estimated. In the case of observer use, observer dynamics must be faster than aircraft dynamics, in other words observer roots must be placed to the left side of system roots to estimate the state variables faster than the dynamic system. Until this part of the thesis, it is assumed that the flight is operated in a certain condition. The realized desings is thought in nominal cases. But, {{it is a fact that}} stability derivatives are changeable depending on flight condition. Simulations that are presented is showing that these stability derivatives can destabilize the aircraft. The lack of stability forces us to the design of a robust controller. Subsequently, sliding mode controller and robust PID controller designs are realized. Although parameter uncertainties and disturbances, the aircraft behaves as a stable characteristic. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
