6000|$|On, on, Redriffe, as the watermen named Rotherhithe, {{was on one}} bank, {{the marshes}} of the Isle of Dogs were gay with white cotton-grass and <b>red</b> <b>rattle</b> on the other. Then came the wharves and {{building}} yards of Deptford, and beyond them rose the trees of Greenwich Park, while the river below exhibited a forest of masts. The boat stopped at a landing-place to a little garden, with a sanded path, between herbs and flowers. [...] "This is Mistress Darke's," [...] said Loveday, and as a little dwarfish lad came to the gate, she said, [...] "We would speak with your mistress." ...|$|E
6000|$|... (2) Rosea, D. 225, there called Sylvatica, as by S., {{presumably because}} [...] "in pascuis subhumidis non raræ." [...] Beautifully drawn, but, as I have {{described}} it, vigorously erect, {{and with no}} decumbency whatever {{in any part of}} it. Root branched, and enormous in proportion to plant, and I fancy therefore must be good for something if one knew it. But Gerarde, who calls the plant <b>Red</b> <b>Rattle,</b> (it having indeed much in common with the Yellow Rattle), says, [...] "It groweth in moist and moorish meadows; the herbe is not only unprofitable, but likewise hurtful, and an infirmity of the meadows." ...|$|E
25|$|Common names include: red diamond rattlesnake, red rattlesnake, red diamond snake, red diamond-backed rattlesnake, <b>red</b> <b>rattler,</b> {{and western}} diamond rattlesnake. The form found on Cedros Island, {{previously}} described as C. exsul, {{was referred to}} as the Cedros Island diamond rattlesnake, or Cedros Island rattlesnake.|$|R
50|$|While {{the line}} was being electrified, a new station named Cochrane was opened on 2 September 1957. Towards the end of train {{operation}} on the line, freight wagons were shunted into the Sims Metal plant which was about two kilometres from the junction with the Main West line, and there was normally one passenger train {{in the morning and}} one in the afternoon, generally formed by a 4-car single-deck suburban train, locally known as a <b>red</b> <b>rattler.</b>|$|R
50|$|Common names include {{snap and}} <b>rattle,</b> <b>red</b> mallee, white mallee, yorrell, and kong mallee.|$|R
6000|$|... "... And I {{find that}} the Monacha Rosea (<b>Red</b> <b>Rattle</b> is its name, besides [...] the ugly one) is a perennial, {{and several of the}} other draconidæ, [...] foxglove, etc., are biennials, born this year, {{flowering}} and dying next [...] year, and the size of roots is generally proportioned to the life of [...] plants; except when artificial cultivation develops the root specially, [...] as in turnips, etc. Several of the Draconidæ are parasites, and suck [...] the roots of other plants, and have only just enough of their own to [...] catch with. The Yellow Rattle is one; it clings to the roots of the [...] grasses and clovers, and no cultivation will make it thrive without [...] them. My authority for this last fact is Grant Allen; but I have [...] observed for myself that the Yellow Rattle has very small white [...] sucking roots, and no earth sticking to them. The toothworts and broom [...] rapes are Draconidæ, I think, and wholly parasites. Can it be that the [...] <b>Red</b> <b>Rattle</b> is the one member of the family that has 'proper pride, and [...] is self supporting'? the others are mendicant orders. We had what we [...] choose to call the Dorcas flower show yesterday, and we gave, as usual, [...] prizes for wild flower bouquets. I tried to find out the local names of [...] several flowers, but they all seemed to be called 'I don't know, [...] ma'am.' I would not allow this name to suffice for the red poppy, and I [...] said 'This red flower must be called something--tell me what you [...] call it?' A few of the audience answered 'Blind Eyes.' Is it because [...] they have to do with sleep that they are called Blind Eyes--or because [...] they are dazzling?" ...|$|E
50|$|Some {{parasitic}} {{plants are}} generalists and parasitize many different species, even several different species at once. Dodder (Cassytha spp., Cuscuta spp.) and <b>red</b> <b>rattle</b> (Odontites vernus) are generalist parasites. Other parasitic plants are specialists that parasitize a few {{or even just}} one species. Beech drops (Epifagus virginiana) is a root holoparasite only on American beech (Fagus grandifolia). Rafflesia is a holoparasite on the vine Tetrastigma. Plants such as Pterospora become parasites of mycorrhizal fungi. There is evidence that parasites also practice self-discrimination, species of Tryphysaria experience reduced haustorium development {{in the presence of}} other Tryphysaria. Although, the mechanism for self-discrimination in parasites is not yet known.|$|E
50|$|In one {{ceremony}}, certain {{social groups}} carry <b>red</b> gourd <b>rattles,</b> other groups carry black rattles, {{and a third}} social group concludes the ceremony by chasing the singer-dancers and breaking their rattles. Suya ceremonies were long (a ceremonial period often lasted several months) and organized around rites of passage—especially the initiation of boys into the men's house.|$|R
5000|$|Lowland meadow and pasture flowers include meadow thistle, {{creeping}} thistle, spear thistle, pignut, lesser knapweed, meadow thistle, smooth hawksbeard, eyebright, ragged robin, <b>red</b> bartsia, yellow <b>rattle,</b> marsh lousewort, cowslip, catsear, autumn hawkbit, meadow buttercup, {{bulbous buttercup}} and dandelion ...|$|R
60|$|I climbed still higher, {{among the}} <b>red</b> <b>rattling</b> gravel and dwarf {{underwood}} of Mount Saint Helena, until I could look right down upon Silverado, and admire the favoured nook {{in which it}} lay. The sunny plain of fog was several hundred feet higher; behind the protecting spur a gigantic accumulation of cottony vapour threatened, with every second, to blow over and submerge our homestead; but the vortex setting past the Toll House was too strong; and there lay our little platform, {{in the arms of}} the deluge, but still enjoying its unbroken sunshine. About eleven, however, thin spray came flying over the friendly buttress, and I began to think the fog had hunted out its Jonah after all. But it was the last effort. The wind veered while we were at dinner, and began to blow squally from the mountain summit; and by half-past one, all that world of sea-fogs was utterly routed and flying here and there into the south in little rags of cloud. And instead of a lone sea-beach, we found ourselves once more inhabiting a high mountain-side, with the clear green country far below us, and the light smoke of Calistoga blowing in the air.|$|R
60|$|The {{farmer and}} his men went their way, and Rose was just {{settling}} herself at the upper window, where the hay had been pitched in, when {{a long line of}} gay <b>red</b> vans came <b>rattling</b> down the road, followed by carriages and gilded cars, elephants and camels, fine horses and frisky ponies, all more or less excited by the coming storm.|$|R
60|$|It chanced {{that this}} same horse {{was either a}} faster or a fresher one than that which bore the young merchant. The <b>red</b> cab <b>rattled</b> down Fleet Street, then doubled on its tracks, and coming back by St. Paul's plunged into a {{labyrinth}} of side streets, from which it eventually emerged upon the Thames Embankment. In spite of all its efforts, however, it was unable to shake off its pursuer. The red cab journeyed on down the Embankment and across one of the bridges, Tom's able charioteer still keeping {{only a few yards}} behind it. Among the narrow streets on the Surrey side Ezra's vehicle pulled up at a low beer-shop. Tom's drove on a hundred yards or so, and then stopped where he could have a good view of whatever occurred. Ezra had jumped out and entered the public-house. Tom waited patiently outside until he should reappear. His movements hitherto had puzzled him completely. For a moment the wild hope came into his head that Kate might be concealed in this strange hiding-place, but a little reflection showed him the absurdity and impossibility of the idea.|$|R
