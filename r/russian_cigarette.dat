The Duchess smoked a <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarette</b> with her coffee, {{and it seemed to}} him that imperceptibly she had moved a little nearer to him. Her elbows were upon the table and her hands clasped. She seemed for a moment to study one or two quaint rings upon her fingers.|$|E
6000|$|After dessert Istra slowly drew a plain gold {{cigarette-case}} from a brocade bag of silvery gray. She {{took out}} a match and a thin <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarette,</b> which she carefully lighted.

[...] As he hesitatingly entered she warbled: [...] "Needn't both be {{so lonely}} all the time, after all, need we? Even if you don't like poor Istra. You don't--do you?" [...] Seemingly she didn't expect {{an answer to}} her question, for she was busy lighting a <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarette.</b> It {{was the first time}} in his life that he had seen a woman smoke.|$|E
60|$|About half-way through {{dinner that}} night, Cecil de la Borne drew {{a long sigh}} of relief. At last his misgivings were set at rest. His party was going to be, was already, in fact, pronounced, a success. A glance at his fair neighbour, however, who was {{lighting}} her third or fourth <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarette</b> since the caviare, sent a shiver of thankfulness through his whole being. What a sensible fellow Andrew had been to clear out. This sort of thing would not have appealed to him at all.|$|E
60|$|With great {{ceremony}} {{the newcomers}} {{were conducted to}} the best table upon the terrace. The man was evidently an habitué. He had scarcely taken his seat before, with a very low bow, the sommelier brought him a small wine-glass filled with {{what seemed to be}} vermouth. While he sipped it he smoked a <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarette</b> and with a gold pencil wrote out the menu of his luncheon. In a few minutes the manager himself came hurrying out from the restaurant. His salute was almost reverential. When, after a few moments' conversation, he departed, he did so with the air of one taking leave of royalty. Lady Weybourne, who was an inquisitive little person, was puzzled.|$|E

I was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot. My momentary annoyance vanished.|$|R
50|$|On 18 August 2008, Wakanohō {{was arrested}} for {{possession}} of cannabis. A wallet belonging to Wakanohō was found on 24 June and handed in to police. It contained a <b>Russian</b> made <b>cigarette</b> mixed with {{what appeared to be}} cannabis, and the wrestler's identification. Wakanohō said he bought two bags of marijuana, a rolled joint, a pipe and two <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> from a <b>Russian</b> and a black man for 20,000 yen in a club in Roppongi. Police had also searched his apartment and private quarters at Magaki stable and recovered a small quantity of cannabis in a bag, and a pipe used to smoke the drug.|$|R

40|$|Melancholy {{shades of}} gray muted the daybreak as a {{penetrating}} cold stifled all color but the occasional red flare of a <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarette.</b> Next to us, a huddle of travelers clad in black gazed drearily at the baggage claim ramp processing in endless circles. Their somber faces, drained of emotion, had known decades of firm Soviet rule. Overhead, the dusky walls of the Novosibirsk airport displayed a sign that read in scratched letters, “Welcome to Siberia. ” One by one, our boxes of medical supplies emerged. We were thankful that {{nearly all of the}} antibiotics, analgesics, syringes, bandages, antiseptics, and dental supplies had cleared Moscow customs. These provisions would save lives. Yes to Yeshua This was my second mission trip to Russia with Yeshua Medical Ministries. 1 Yeshua is the Hebrew name for Jesus, the “Great Physician, ” whose example of healing, compassion, and sacrifice recorded in the Bible had moved me to leave the comfort and safety of home to travel overseas for two weeks of medical practice. The opportunity to practice medicine in a foreign land is a special privilege. Working closely with colleagues abroad toward a common goal cultivates true friendships. And the special glimpses into their personal lives that patients share with their physician offer a view into another culture more intimate than the casual tourist can ever know. In the center of Novosibirsk stood a huge statue of Lenin poised defiantly against howling winter winds that can reach 60 °F below zero. Nearby, the river Ob, frozen from October to May, wound past the hub of the trans-Siberian railroad, flowing nort...|$|E

5000|$|This {{character}} {{resembles the}} penniless writer in Knut Hamsun's 1890 novel Hunger, but lacks {{the anger and}} nihilism of Hamsun's narrator. The story was republished in a collection whose royalties enabled Saroyan to travel to Europe and Armenia, where he learned to love the taste of <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> once observing, [...] "you may tend to get cancer from {{the thing that makes}} you want to smoke so much, not from the smoking itself."

I speak frankly, because you also know that no possible extremity would induce me to accept help from any living person. You notice that I have recently spent ten francs on a box of the best <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> {{and that there are}} roses upon my table.

5000|$|However, {{the show}} was in fact an {{elaborate}} practical joke, described by Commissioning Editor Angela Jain as [...] "Candid Camera live in space" [...] and claimed by Channel 4 to have cost roughly £5million.

He claims rarely to drink in [...] "Dance of the Dead", and is seen to smoke only twice—once a cigar, and once in a dream sequence. [...] "The Schizoid Man" [...] establishes Number 6 as an at-least-occasional cigar smoker, as Number Two brainwashes him into preferring <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> as a means of undermining his identity. Number 6 has repeatedly been under the influence of psychotropic and hallucinogenic drugs, and undergone periods of severe mental or physical stress without apparent effect on his health, although he has occasionally been driven to exhaustion by his ordeals.|$|R

I was rigged with tube that went under my clothes and down my finger to the cigarette, but somehow the contraption wouldn't exude smoke. [...] "I want long <b>cigarettes</b> — the <b>Russian</b> kind!" [...] Orson ordered.

Then he said in his gruff manner, [...] "Turn 'em." [...] But just before I started, he added quietly in his warm voice, [...] "Good luck." [...] I blew the first take. It was 30, 40 takes before I completed a shot that Orson liked — and I had only one line. That was almost 30 years ago, but even today I have people repeat it to me, including young students. The line was: [...] "Rosebud … I'll tell you about Rosebud …" ...|$|R

40|$|Katherine Mansfield is {{recognised}} {{today as}} one of the leading exponents of the modernist short story. Interest in her work is at an all time high and her collections of short stories have never been out of print since her death at the age of 34 in 1923. Her literary debt to the Russian writer Anton Chekhov is well documented; perhaps less well known was her lifelong obsession with all things Russian, culminating in her death whilst at an émigré Russian community in Fontainebleau, headed by George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff. As a young writer Mansfield toyed with Russian sounding pseudonyms: Katya, Katerina, Kissienka, Katoushka and Katerina, wore Russian costume, smoked <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and attended <b>Russian</b> concerts and the ballet. As co-editor with John Middleton Murry of one of the earliest modernist magazines, Rhythm (which later became The Blue Review), she was able to bring her fascination with all things Russian to the attention of others. Using the Russian pseudonym ‘Boris Petrovsky’, she placed two of her own poems in issue four of Rhythm (Spring 1912). By issue seven in August 1912, the magazine could boast its own Russian Correspondent: one ‘Michael Lykiardopoulos’. In 1914 she met the Russian émigré Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky (1880 - 1955), to whom she remained devoted (despite the occasional period of estrangement), until her death. Together they worked on translations from the Russian. Unpublished collaborations included ‘Maxim Gorky’s Journal of the Revolution’ in 1918. In April 1919, the first of a thirteen part series of collaborative translations of Chekhov’s letters appeared in the Athenaeum. In 1922, the pair worked on a translation of Gorky’s Reminiscences of Leonid Andreyev which was eventually published in a limited edition in 1928. This paper will examine the impact of Russian culture on the life of Katherine Mansfield and demonstrate how this influence came to embed itself in her own modernist inventions within the realm of the twentieth-century short stor...|$|R
40|$|Katherine Mansfield is {{recognised}} {{today as}} one of the leading exponents of the modernist short story, with interest in her work at an all time high. Her literary debt to the Russian writer Anton Chekhov is well documented, but in fact she maintained a lifelong obsession with all things Russian, culminating in her death at Fontainebleau, surrounded by émigré Russians at George Ivanovitch Gurdjieff’s esoteric community, the ‘Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man’. As a young writer Mansfield toyed with Russian sounding pseudonyms: Katya, Katerina, Kissienka and Katoushka, wore Russian costume, smoked <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes</b> and attended <b>Russian</b> concerts and the ballet. As co-editor with John Middleton Murry of one of the earliest modernist journals, Rhythm, she was able to bring her fascination with all things Russian to the attention of others. She used the Russian pseudonym ‘Boris Petrovsky’ to place several of her poems in the journal and by issue 7 in August 1912, Rhythm could even boast its own ‘Russian Correspondent’, Michael Lykiardopoulos, almost certainly as a result of Mansfield’s influence, as I shall reveal. In 1914 Mansfield and Murry met the Russian émigré Samuel Solomonovich Koteliansky (1880 - 1955), always known as ‘Kot’, to whom she remained devoted (despite the occasional period of estrangement) until her death. After Mansfield and Murry left their house in St John’s Wood in London in October 1915, following the death of her young brother Leslie (killed in a hand grenade incident on the Belgian-French border), Kot took over the lease of the house and remained there until his death in 1955. Beatrice Campbell reveals how Mansfield’s image was constantly in his mind, almost as if she had still been alive. ‘Her’ pear tree in the garden, the guilder rose she had planted, the lock of hair she had once given him, the chair she used to sit in when she wrote – all were devotedly preserved. On a professional level Mansfield and Kot worked together on translations from the Russian. Unpublished collaborations included ‘Maxim Gorky’s Journal of the Revolution’ in 1918. In April 1919, the first of a thirteen part series of collaborative translations of Chekhov’s letters appeared in the Athenaeum. In 1922, the pair worked on a translation of Gorky’s Reminiscences of Leonid Andreyev which was eventually published in a limited edition in 1928. Although the last years of Mansfield’s life were spent abroad, seeking relief from the symptoms of her tuberculosis, the pair maintained an epistolary friendship. Murry’s own relationship with Kot was never an easy one and in fact the tension between them contributed to the periods of estrangement between Mansfield and Kot. Murry especially never forgave him for recommending the Russian doctor Manoukhin, whose x-ray treatments he felt had precipitated Mansfield towards an early grave. This essay will therefore examine the influence of Russian culture on the life of Katherine Mansfield, focused on her relationship – and those of her contemporaries – with S. S. Koteliansky...|$|R
60|$|Let us arrange in some order {{a number}} of {{converging}} considerations that all point in this direction. (1) It is broadly true, no doubt, that the weapon of the employer has hitherto been the threat of dismissal, that is, the threat of enforced starvation. He is a Sultan who need not order the bastinado, {{so long as he}} can order the sack. But there are not a few signs that this weapon is not quite so convenient and flexible a one as his increasing rapacities require. The fact of the introduction of fines, secretly or openly, in many shops and factories, proves that it is convenient for the capitalists to have some temporary and adjustable form of punishment besides the final punishment of pure ruin. Nor is it difficult to see the commonsense of this from their wholly inhuman point of view. The act of sacking a man is attended with the same disadvantages as the act of shooting a man: one of which is that you can get no more out of him. It is, I am told, distinctly annoying to blow a fellow creature's brains out with a revolver and then suddenly remember that he was the only person who knew where to get the best <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes.</b> So our Sultan, who is the orderer of the sack, is also the bearer of the bow-string. A school in which there was no punishment, except expulsion, would be a school in which {{it would be very difficult}} to keep proper discipline; and the sort of discipline on which the reformed capitalism will insist will be all of the type which in free nations is imposed only on children. Such a school would probably be in a chronic condition of breaking up for the holidays. And the reasons for the insufficiency of this extreme instrument are also varied and evident. The materialistic Sociologists, who talk about the survival of the fittest and the weakest going to the wall (and whose way of looking at the world is to put on the latest and most powerful scientific spectacles, and then shut their eyes), frequently talk as if a workman were simply efficient or non-efficient, as if a criminal were reclaimable or irreclaimable. The employers have sense enough at least to know better than that. They can see that a servant may be useful in one way and exasperating in another; that he may be bad in one part of his work and good in another; that he may be occasionally drunk and yet generally indispensable. Just as a practical school-master would know that a schoolboy can be at once the plague and the pride of the school. Under these circumstances small and varying penalties are obviously the most convenient things for the person keeping order; an underling can be punished for coming late, and yet do useful work when he comes. It will be possible to give a rap over the knuckles without wholly cutting off the right hand that has offended. Under these circumstances the employers have naturally resorted to fines. But there is a further ground for believing that the process will go beyond fines before it is completed.|$|R

S. and Russia were officially on friendly terms, the Messersmiths extended the Oumanskys the usual courtesies; they in fact liked Mrs. Oumansky very much, but Oumansky himself had not changed; he was annoyed by reports in American press (and republished in Mexico) about the espionage system he was maintaining in Mexico, and came to Messersmith demanding that he do something about it; Messersmith replied that neither he nor the U. S. Government controlled the American press; Oumansky tried to convince Messersmith that reports were false, but never succeeded; he bragged of superiority of everything <b>Russian,</b> including <b>Russian</b> <b>cigarettes,</b> and then cadged American cigarettes from Mrs. Messersmith at every opportunity; early one morning in Jan. 1946, a plane he borrowed from Mexican Army and piloted by one of best Mexican pilots, crashed on take off for El Salvador, killing both Oumansky and Mrs. Oumansky, the crew, and all except one of the Soviet Embassy staff on board; Soviet Government tried to claim it was sabotage, but though Mexican authorities made thorough investigation, they found no evidence of sabotage; when the Messersmiths were leaving the funeral, Mrs. Messersmith remarked she wouldn't have been surprised if the lid of Oumansky's casket popped up and he leaned out and said, "Well, haven't you got a cigarette for me?...|$|R
