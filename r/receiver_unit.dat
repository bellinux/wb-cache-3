5|$|Serrate {{used the}} Mk. IV {{equipment}} for reception and display, replacing only the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit.</b> This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the final approach.|$|E

25|$|JAXA {{announced}} on 12 March 2015 that they wirelessly beamed 1.8 kilowatts 50 meters {{to a small}} receiver by converting electricity to microwaves {{and then back to}} electricity. This is the standard plan for this type of power.

30|$|In this section, {{we present}} the smart home {{infrastructure}} {{composed of a}} distributed network of <b>receiver</b> <b>units.</b> In particular, Section 5.1 presents four packet loss mitigation techniques, whereas in Section 5.2, we combine these techniques in a distributed network of <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> that deliver the data to the SHG [50].|$|R
5000|$|HCPVT {{active cooling}} enables {{the use of}} much higher power thermal-photovoltaic <b>receiver</b> <b>units,</b> {{generating}} typically 1-100 kilowatts electric, as compared to HCPV systems that mostly rely upon passive cooling of single ~20W cells. Such high-power receivers utilize dense arrays of cells mounted on a high-efficiency heat sink. [...] Minimizing the number of individual <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> is a simplification that should ultimately yield improvement in the overall balance of system costs, manufacturability, maintainability/upgradeability, and reliability.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{potential}} {{issue is}} the effect of mirror glare on airplane pilots. Additionally, [...] "the power towers have 'receiver units' at their top on which the mirror fields focus their reflected light. During operation, these <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> become extremely hot, such that they glow and appear brightly lit. ... Because they are high above the ground, these glowing <b>receiver</b> <b>units</b> will be a visible distraction to persons at many of the KOPs Observation Points, including travelers utilizing I-15." ...|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} airborne <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> was AN/APN-4 unit of 1943. It {{was physically}} {{identical to the}} UK's two-piece Gee set, and could be easily interchanged with these units. The main unit with the display also housed most of the controls. General operation started by selecting one of nine stations, labeled 0 to 8, and setting the sweep speed to 1, the lowest setting. The operator would then use the intensity and focus controls to fine tune the signal and provide a sharp display.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1942, Robert Dippy, {{the lead}} {{developer}} of the Gee {{system at the}} Telecommunications Research Establishment (TRE) in the UK, {{was sent to the}} US for eight months to help with LORAN development. At the time the project was being driven primarily by Captain Harding of the US Navy, and they were concentrating entirely on a shipboard system. Dippy convinced them that an airborne version was definitely possible, leading to some interest by the US Army Air Force. The Navy was unhappy about this turn of events. Dippy also instituted a number of simple changes that would prove extremely useful in practice. Among these, he outright demanded that the airborne LORAN receivers be built physically similar to the Gee receivers, so that they could be swapped out in service simply by replacing the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit.</b> This would prove extremely useful; RAF Transport Command aircraft could swap their receivers when moving to or from the Australian theatre. Dippy also designed the ground station timing equipment.|$|E
2500|$|Wireless {{keyboards}} {{have become}} popular for their increased user freedom. A wireless keyboard often includes a required combination transmitter and <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> that {{attaches to the}} computer's keyboard port. The wireless aspect is achieved either by radio frequency (RF) or by infrared (IR) signals sent and received from both the keyboard and the unit attached to the computer. A wireless keyboard may use an industry standard RF, called Bluetooth. With Bluetooth, the transceiver may be built into the computer. However, a wireless keyboard needs batteries to work and may pose a security problem due {{to the risk of}} data [...] "eavesdropping" [...] by hackers. Wireless solar keyboards charge their batteries from small solar panels using sunlight or standard artificial lighting. An early example of a consumer wireless keyboard is that of the Olivetti Envision.|$|E

25|$|<b>Receiver</b> <b>units</b> {{improved}} greatly over time. The AN/APN-4 {{was quickly}} supplanted by the AN/APN-9 of 1945, an all-in-one <b>unit</b> combining the <b>receiver</b> and display of greatly reduced weight.|$|R
50|$|To make radio {{surveys of}} the sky with {{adequate}} resolution, the antennas are arranged in clusters (stations) that are spread out over an area of more than 1000 km in diameter. The LOFAR stations in the Netherlands reach baselines of about 100 km. LOFAR currently receives data from 24 core stations (in Exloo), 14 'remote' stations in The Netherlands and 8 international stations. Each of the core and remote stations has 48 HBA's and 96 LBA's {{and a total of}} 48 digital <b>Receiver</b> <b>Units</b> (RCU's).

2500|$|By the 1920s, when {{amplification}} made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird {{employed the}} Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype {{in a little}} village called Santa Cruz {{on the island of}} Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He had also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named [...] "Stooky Bill", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926 he demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as the first television demonstration in history. The subject was Baird's business partner Oliver Hutchinson. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A bright light shining through a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses projected a bright spot of light that swept across the subject. A selenium photoelectric tube detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a <b>receiver</b> <b>unit,</b> where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face.|$|E

50|$|A typical HTIB {{generally}} {{consists of}} a central <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> which usually contains a DVD player (some systems separate the DVD player into a separate unit), a multi-channel power amplifier {{and a series of}} speakers for surround sound use, generally including a subwoofer. Some HTIB systems also have a radio tuner or an Internet-based streaming audio platform (e.g. Spotify). The least expensive systems usually have a passive subwoofer, which is amplified by the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit.</b> HTIB systems do not include a television set or monitor with which to display the visual material or a stand to place the <b>receiver</b> <b>unit</b> on. Beside auxiliary inputs, many of them are equipped today with HDMI with ARC, optical and SPDIF inputs.|$|E
