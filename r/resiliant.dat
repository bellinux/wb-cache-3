Putties are mass-produced in Finster's Monstermatic through use of steam-pressured molds and then sent through the Monstermatic in large numbers. Putties do have some manner of spoken language, though it is incomprehensible to humans, coming across as strings of garbled noises.|$|E
40|$|Can the {{benefits}} of re-use and patterns that are so well known in software design and implementation be carried over into analysis and database design? The fledgling field of Analysis Patterns has provided only a partial affirmative answer. We have instead attempted to import the CYC upper ontology (an AI-derived “model of everything”) into an object model expressed in Java. The result is an object model that is extremely <b>resiliant</b> to change and should be extensible to practically any domain.

40|$|<b>Resiliant</b> and {{appropriate}} mechanisms {{of learning and}} knowledge sharing are key to the constructive and sustainable development of knowledge and innovation in expert communities. Research exploring such mechanisms among different groups of experts, as examples of communities of practice, was undertaken {{both inside and outside}} formal organizations to reveal common foundations and different motivations. In the expanding knowledge economy, the need for organizations to cultivate and manage knowledge s their critical resource is an imperative. There is no doubt that communities of practice have {{a central role in the}} capability development. An interpretive approach was employed for this exploratory research; the findings indicate that expert knowledge is a complex outcome of social and contextual factors, and individual agendas. Further the sustainability and dynamics of expert knowledge in communities of practice is an outcome of these socio-contextual drivers as each collective negotiates the relevance or redundancy of knowledge for their shared objectives.

40|$|A rev 1, 11 of the {{research}} literature reveals that early in their school careers, children learn that reading is closely identified with the female role and, though less so, mathematics with the male role. These stereotypes increase with age and become particularly debilitating for females in math achievement. Though reading is strongly identified as ofeminineen boys ale apparently <b>resiliant</b> enough to overcome the stereotype. The identification of reading as feminine is not true universally and is more closely associated with North American countries. However, while sex differences in reading are common before age ten in the United States, they tend to disappear by adulthood. One possible explanation {{for this is that}} after elementary school, reading is no longer defined as a course but as a process, and becomes an essential tool is all school classes. An examination of studies that have analyzed sex differences i 4 reading and math [...] after controlling for intelligence, reading readiness, spatial ability, and differential course taking [...] reveals that cultural and environmental factors are the primary explanations for such differences.

40|$|With {{the move}} to use side-looking imaging sonars in very shallow waters as a com-ponent part of MCM operations, {{synthetic}} aperture sonars (SAS) appear to have some advantages over a conventional real aperture side-looking sonars. One significant advan-tage of SAS {{is that it is}} quite <b>resiliant</b> to image degradation caused by surface backscatter and surface multipath. The processing in all SAS imaging algorithm assumes the only thing moving between transmitted pings is the sonar platform. Since the algorithm uses coherent integration to assemble the final image, any movement of the sea surface be-tween pings destroys the ping-to-ping coherence of the surface multipath as well as the ping-to-ping surface backscattered return. To move towards understanding just how ef-fective a SAS is at supressing backscatter and surface multipath, we first need to model the moving sea surface in a believable way and establish just how the sound reflects off the undersurface of the sea. This paper first describes a commonly-used physically justi-fiable sea-surface autocorrelation function that accounts for wind direction, wave height, wave period and wave velocity. From this autocorrelation function, a statistically appro-priate random wave surface is generated which evolves in both time and space. Finally i...|$|E
40|$|This book {{is about}} reidentification methods, and, more especifically, about record linkage. This study is {{motivated}} {{on the need to}} assess in an accurate way the risk of disclosure within the fields of privacy preserving data mining (PPDM) and statistical disclosure control (SDC). Data protection methods are constructed so that disclosure is avoided when data is published. Nevertheless, before data publication, risk should be assessed as accurately as possible. Record linkage is one of the approaches to compute this risk. It is, in fact, a computational approach for risk assessment based on some assumptions about the information an intruder has. An important characteristic of record linkage methods is that they are flexible enough to be used in a large number of different scenarios. For example, they can be either used for assessing risk of data protected adding some noise, or used for assessing risk when data has been generated synthetically. In this book, record linkage methods are discussed, and new approaches are described. Specific methods are proposed. They are methods that take advantage of the available information on the protection methods. The author later shows their effectiveness in comparison to standard ones. The book also shows how the analysis of the results of risk assessment via record linkage can be used to develop new methods for data protection. In short, new data protection methods are <b>resiliant</b> to some of the attacks of record linkage. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} better, safer, more {{efficient}} system for Sealeze to manufacture spiral-wrapped strip brushes in a continuous fashion at a variable diameter. The end results produced a finalized drawing sheet for machining and production, numerous design variations within CAD drawings, and extensive mechanical evaluations and analyses proving the strength and capabilities of the proposed design. In production of these brushes, various different materials will be used for the core, backing, and filament, creating a need for a mandrel that will be strong enough to handle the most <b>resiliant</b> of materials while maintaining a narrow margin of tolerances for numerous manufacturing jobs while remaining man-portable and minutely adjustable. During the development stage of the project a traditional approach of design, analyze, review, consult, repeat was employed where meetings with the sponsor organization were frequent as progress was made through numerous iterations before arriving at the final design. Despite production of a functioning design that met the sponsor 2 ̆ 7 s desires and initial project development goals, the project is marked by its large size and possible issues of binding and seizing if not properly employed. In addition, the design does not function adequately at small sizes, limiting the range of application. Despite this, based on long term production, the mandrel will increase safety and efficiency for the manufacture of custom-sized, spiral-wrapped strip brushes in an industrial setting. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|Global {{warming is}} likely to alter {{reproductive}} success of ground-nesting birds that lay eggs normally left unattended for days or even weeks before actual parental incubation, especially in already warm climates. The native North American bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is such a species, and pre-incubation quail eggs may experience temperatures ≥ 45 °C. Yet, almost nothing is known about embryonic survival after such high pre-incubation temperatures. Freshly laid bobwhite quail eggs were exposed during a 12 day pre-incubation period to one of five thermal regimes: low oscillating temperatures (25 - 40 °C, mean = 28. 9 °C), high oscillating temperatures (30 - 45 °C, mean = 33. 9 °C), low constant temperatures (28. 85 °C), high constant temperatures (mean = 33. 9 °C), or commercially employed pre-incubation temperatures (20 °C). After treatment, eggs were then incubated at a standard 37. 5 °C to determine subsequent effects on embryonic development rate, survival, water loss, hatching, and embryonic oxygen consumption. Both quantity of heating degree hours during pre-incubation and specific thermal regime (oscillating vs. non-oscillating) profoundly affected important aspects of embryo survival and indices of development and growth Pre-incubation quail eggs showed a remarkable tolerance to constant high temperatures (up to 45 °C), surviving for 4. 5 ± 0. 3 days of subsequent incubation, but high oscillating pre-incubation temperature increased embryo survival (mean survival 12. 2 ± 1. 8 days) and led to more rapid development than high constant temperature (maximum 38. 5 °C), even though both groups experienced the same total heating degree-hours. Oxygen consumption was ~ 200 - 300 μl O 2. egg. min- 1 at hatching in all groups, and was not affected by pre-incubation conditions. Oscillating temperatures, which are the norm for pre-incubation quail eggs in their natural habitat, thus enhanced survival at higher temperatures. However, a 5 °C increase in pre-incubation temperature, which equates to the predicted long-term increases of 5 °C or more, nonetheless reduced hatching rate by approximately 50 %. Thus, while pre-incubation bobwhite eggs may be <b>resiliant</b> to moderate oscillating temperature increases, global warming will likely severely impact wild bobwhite quail populations, especially in their strongholds in southern latitudes...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of ethnohistorical sources, modem pollen rain, fossil pollen, contemporary vegetation patterns and. thedistribution of Aboriginal sites enabled a moc;tel of Holocene vegetation change in northeastern Tasmania to be developed. The influential hypotheses of fire stick farming and ecological drift are {{shown to be}} generally <b>resiliant</b> and worthwhile but in need of adjustment to account for local and regional variations in environmental and cultural practices. A more recent theory in which Aborigines were forced out of southwestern Tasmania at about 12, 000 BP by expanding Holocene forests is re-evaluated {{in the light of}} evidence which suggests that forests may have developed earlier than previously thought and that Aborigines, forests and fire in Tasmania have had a long co-existence. A study of all available Tasmanian ethnohistorical sources pertaining to Aboriginal burning of vegetation revealed a pattern of Aboriginal land use from ca. 1 n 3 - 1830 which was more complex than previously thought. In northeastern Tasmania, fire was used in a fashion corresponding to the position of sites along an altitudinal gradient from sea level to 1, 500 m. A close reading of the available information reveals that present day ecologists and archaeologists often use ethnohistorical references concerning fire in an uncritical manner. A number of crucial historical incidents in which European mariners sighted devastating fires and dense clouds of smoke are reinterpreted as defensive responses by Aborigines to the presence of Europeans, rather than a normal modus operandi. These sources cannot therefore be taken to indicate a traditional use of fire. Historical sources suggest that Aboriginal life in Tasmania revolved around a complete familiarity with forests. Previous research has highlighted the importance of coastlines for settlement, and that forests, especially wet forests, were inimical to Aboriginal settlement objectives. The analysis emphasises that Aboriginal fire regimes differed across the state according to social perogatives as well as to environmental determinants. Archaeological surveys and limited excavations were conducted in order to date the commencement of Aboriginal site formation in coastal, inland and mountainous environments. It was discovered that coastal sites in the northeast date to the last 3, 000 years of the Holocene. Sites which are located on the margins of lunette fringed lagoons and shallow freshwater lagoons date from about 6, 000 years BP to ca. 8, 500 BP. In the highlands of the northeast, rockshelters are dated to 1, 600 years BP. Prior to an investigation of fossil pollen to determine vegetation changes over the same range of times, Tauber pollen traps were placed in a selection of representative vegetation communities in the northeast. The results of this study were used to form analogues against which fossil pollen assemblages were compared. In this way it was possible to reconstruct past vegetation associations with a degree of precision not available by the {{analysis of}} fossil pollen alone. Analyses from a coastal lagoon, an inland marsh, two highland bogs and sediment from an Aboriginal site revealed patterns of vegetation change which drew attention to the effects of Aboriginal burning on the landscape. A 10, 500 year old pollen sequence from the coastal lagoon suggested that the vegetation had changed from a pre-Holocene Poaceae dominated steppe complex, to a Eucalyptus forest, and finally to an Allocasuarina dominated coastal heathland. The final change to heathland occurred at 6, 500 years BP. This date is synchronous with the stabilization of sea levels, increases in inorganic input into lagoon sediments, major peaks in Typha spp. pollen and the commencement of Aboriginal occupation on lagoon margins. The present day structure of the vegetation is likely to have resulted from a complex interaction between environmental variables and the burning of forests and heathlands by Aborigines. Eucalyptus forests surrounding a small closed basin at 80 m altitude in the hinterland have existed virtually unchanged for 4, 000 years. Further evidence suggests that these forests may have been extant for at least 13, 000 years. Increases in regional wet forest and rainforest pollen taxa point to a change in climate at about 3, 500 BP which allowed an expansion of wet forest communities. This is supported by increases in local spore percentages which show that the hydrology of the basin changed to allow the development of a Sphagnum bog. The humid phase is thought to have continued for a maximum of about 1, 000 years, after which time drier climates prevailed. It is possible that decreases in temperature rather than increases in precipitation were responsible for the perturbation. Throughout the 4, 000 year long sequence, high levels of carbonized particles indicates that burning by Aborigines was continuous. Pollen from a short core obtained from a highland bog surrounded by wet eucalypt and rainforest communities, showed a transition from grassland or grassy woodland to wet forest at about 3, 000 BP. It is thought that burning of local forests by Aborigines altered the local hydrology sufficiently to create a mire at about 5, 500 years BP. Continued burning maintained an open grassy formation for 2, 000 years. The abandonment of the site by Aborigines as a place for frequent burning {{led to the development of}} forests in which wet forest taxa predominated and where fires were less frequent but more intense. Sediment from a highland buttongrass moor adjacent to a 1, 600 year old Aboriginal site was analysed for pollen. The sequence displays little vegetation change since the onset of organic accumulation 1, 600 years ago. Synchrony between the two dates provides the first direct palaeoecological evidence that Aboriginal burning practices were involved in the creation and maintainence of buttongrass moorlands in Tasmania. The pollen and archaeological evidence, in combination with the analysis of ethnohistorical sources demonstrate that forests and Aborigines have a long history of coexistence. Aboriginal fires had major effects on delicately poised coastal ecosystems and lesser effects on inland lowland forests. In elevated locations with high rainfall and fertile soil, fire was employed to produce small treeless patches. Burning on poorly drained infertile sites is thought to have initiated hydrological changes which resulted in the creation of limited areas of sedgeland...|$|E
