40|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>resinoids</b> from St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L) was studied {{in a series}} of two papers. In the first part, the effects of the operating conditions on the yield of <b>resinoids</b> (total extract) were analyzed, while the mathematical models of extraction kinetics were compared in the second one. The extraction was carried out using an aqueous solution of ethanol (70 and 95 % v/v) at a hydromodulus (plant material to solvent ratio, w/v) of 1 : 5 or 1 : 10. The plant material was disintegrated and divided into three fractions (mean particle size: 0. 23, 0. 57 and 1. 05 mm). The temperature was 25, 50 or about 80 °C (boiling temperature). A higher yield of <b>resinoids</b> was obtained when the plant material of greater disintegration degree (0. 23 mm) was treated with 70 % v/v aqueous ethanol solution at higher hydromoduli (1 : 10) and temperatures (80 °C). The effects of the operating factors on the yield of <b>resinoids</b> were estimated by using both the full factorial experimental plan 24 and artificial neuronic networks (ANN) of 3 - 4 - 1 topology.

5000|$|The Latin name Ferula derives in {{part from}} Ferule which is a schoolmaster's rod, such as a cane, stick, or flat piece of wood, used in {{punishing}} children. A ferula called narthex (or Giant fennel), which shares the galbanum-like scent, has long, straight and sturdy hollow stalks, which are segmented like bamboo. They were used as torches in antiquity and it is with such a torch that, according to Greek mythology, Prometheus, who deceived his father stealing some of his fire, brought fire to humanity. [...] Bacchae were described using the bamboo-like stalks as weapons.Such rods were also used for walking sticks, splints, for stirring boiling liquids, and for corporal punishment. Some of the mythology may have transferred to the related galbanum which {{was referred to as}} the sacred “mother resin.” Galbanum was highly treasured as a sacred substance by the ancient Egyptians. The “green” incense of Egyptian antiquity {{is believed to have been}} galbanum. Galbanum resin has a very intense green scent accompanied by a turpentine odor. The initial notes are a very bitter, acrid, and peculiar scent [...] followed by a complex green, spicy, woody, balsamlike fragrance. When diluted the scent of galbanum has variously been described as reminiscent of pine (due to the pinene and limonene content), evergreen, green bamboo, parsley, green apples, musk, or simply intense green. The oil has a pine like topnote which is less pronounced in the odor of the <b>resinoid.</b> The latter, in turn, has a more woody balsamic, conifer resinous character.

The <b>resinoid</b> and potassium yields were determined by the solvent evaporation from the liquid extracts to constant weight and the AAS emission method, respectively. The dependence of <b>resinoid</b> and potassium yields on the ethanol concentration was described by linear and quadratic polynomial models, respectively. The best potassium extraction selectivity of 0. 077 g K/g of dry extract was achieved by maceration at the ethanol concentrations of 10 g/ 100 g. The artificial neural network (ANN) was successfully applied to estimate the <b>resinoid</b> and potassium yields based on the ethanol concentration in the extracting solvent and the time duration for all three extraction techniques employed. The response surface methodology was also used to present the dependence of ANN results on the operating factors. The extraction process was optimized using the ANN model coupled with genetic algorithm.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of <b>resinoids</b> from St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum L) was studied {{in a series}} of two papers. While the first part dealt with the effects of the operating conditions on the yield of <b>resinoids</b> (total extract) and process optimization, the mathematical models of extraction kinetics were analyzed in the second one. The extraction was carried out using an aqueous solution of ethanol (70 and 95 % v/v) at the hydromodulus (plant material to solvent ratio, w/v) of 1 : 5 or 1 : 10. The plant material was disintegrated and divided into three fractions (particle mean size 0. 23, 0. 57 and 1. 05 mm). The temperature was 25, 50 or about 80 °C (boiling temperature). Three models were applied for modeling the extraction kinetics: a model based on the film theory, a model based on unsteady state diffusion through solid material and the empirical Ponomarev equation. Because of its physical basis, the relative simplicity and good fitting of the experimental data, the model based on the film theory could be proposed for mathematical modeling of solid-liquid etraction processes...|$|R
50|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{solvents}} {{can be used for}} extraction, such as chloroform, dichloromethane, petroleum ether, naphtha, benzene, butane, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, and olive oil. Currently, <b>resinoids</b> are often obtained by extraction with supercritical carbon dioxide. The alcohols extract undesirable water-soluble substances such as chlorophylls and sugars (which can be removed later by washing with water). Non-polar solvents such as benzene, chloroform and petroleum ether will not extract the water-soluble constituents of marijuana or hashish, and will yield a somewhat more potent oil as a result. In general, non-polar cannabis extracts taste much better than polar extracts. Alkali washing further improves the odor and taste.|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to take precautions when eating these plants, as milkweeds {{have been known to}} be poisonous to humans. While there have been no report of toxins in Asclepias lanceolata, many milkweeds do contain toxic <b>resinoids,</b> alkaloids, and cardiac glycosides. The flowers, leaves, and young seedpods of this species have been deemed safe for consumption. Seedpods should be eaten when they are between 3 and 4 cm long; their alkalinity and bitterness increases as they grow larger. Plant parts, especially stems and mature leaves, should be boiled with three changes of water to remove any possible toxins. Younger leaves, pods, and unopened flower buds can be cooked just as one would prepare spinach or broccoli. Once cooked, parts of the plant can be eaten on their own or mixed into other things such as soups. Boiling down the flower clusters containing nectar can make a sugary sweetener.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ductile streaks {{produced}} during diamond grinding of hard and brittle materials have aided the subsequent process of polishing. Two novel techniques {{were used to}} study the formation of ductile mode streaks during diamond grinding (primary process) of germanium, silicon, and glass. In the first technique, aspheric surfaces were generated on Ge and Si at conventional speeds (5000 rpm). In the second technique, diamond grinding of plano surfaces on glass and Si surfaces using high speed (100, 000 rpm) was carried out. Form accuracy, surface finish and ductile mode grinding streaks are discussed in this paper. It was found that <b>resinoid</b> diamond wheels gave more ductile streaks than metal-bonded wheels but better form accuracy was obtained with the latter. Ductile streaks were obtained more easily with pyrex rather than with BK 7 glass thus necessitating very little time for polishing. Ductile streaks appeared in abundance on germanium rather than silicon. Both the novel grinding techniques were used on CNC machining centres...|$|E
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{the extraction}} of the overall extracted materials (resinoids), total hypericine, hypericine and pseudohypericine from amber (Hypericum perforatum L.) was investigated by the procedure of maceration both with and without ultra-sound, using methanol as the extractant.

A {{grinding}} wheel wears rapidly during ultrasonic assisted surface generation {{of a large}} aperture aspherical RB-SiC mirror, which leads to an increase of grinding force and profile error. In this paper, different types of <b>resinoid</b> bonded diamond {{grinding wheel}} with a same grit size were dressed with high-pressure abrasive water jet. The dressing effects of abrasive water jet were assessed through comparing the 3 D roughness of the grinding wheel topographies before and after dressing. The experimental results show that diamond grits of a worn grinding wheel are protruding from bond after dressing. The feed rate of nozzle and the bond materials have {{significant impact on the}} 3 D surface roughness of the wheel and dressing efficient. The softer binder and the decrease of the feed rates and lead to deeper grooves during dressing of grinding wheel.

This system is applicable to the practical grinding operation with <b>resinoid</b> and metal bonded superabrasive wheels with a good degree of accuracy and efficiency. In grinding normally sintered silicon nitride with the resinoid-bonded diamond wheel at a given grinding condi-tion, this system reveals that cutting-edge ratio decreases rapidly due to the micro-fracture of grain tips at the transient stage just after truing/dressing, and it increases slightly with the promotion of attritious wear under the successive steady state. This phenomena are {{explained by the fact that}} abrasive grains are damaged during truing/dressing operation...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} advanced {{tools for}} ultra precision grinding which offer a high wear resistance {{and can be}} used to generate high-quality parts with an ultraprecise surface finish. The first approach features defined dressed, coarse-grained, single layered, metal bonded diamond grinding wheels. These grinding wheels are called Engineered Grinding Wheels and have been dressed by an adapted conditioning process which leads to uniform abrasive grain protrusion heights and flattened grains. This paper shows the results from grinding optical glasses with such Engineered Grinding Wheels regarding the specific forces and the surface roughness. The results show that the cutting mechanism turns into ductile removal and optical surfaces are achievable. On the other hand, the specific normal force F´n increases due to increased contact area of the flattened diamond grains. It is shown that the topography of the Engineered Grinding Wheels has a strong beneficial influence on surface roughness. The second new tool for ultra precision grinding is made of a CVD (Chemical Vapour Deposition) poly-crystalline diamond layer with sharp edges of micrometre-sized diamond crystallites as a special type of abrasive. The sharp edges of the crystallites act as cutting edges which can be used for grinding. It is shown that by using CVD-diamond-coated grinding wheels a high material removal rate and a high surface finish with surface roughness in the nanometre range can be achieved. The CVD-diamond layers exhibit higher wear resistance compared to conventional metal and resin bonded diamond wheels. In conclusion, this paper shows that not only conventional fine grained, multi-layered <b>resinoid</b> diamond grinding wheels but also coarse-grained and binderless CVD-coated diamond grinding wheels can be applied to machine brittle and hard materials by ultra precision grinding...|$|E
