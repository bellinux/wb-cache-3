2500|$|When the Constitution was {{ratified}} in 1787, {{the ratio}} of the populations of large states to small states was roughly twelve to one. The Connecticut Compromise gave every state, large and small, an equal vote in the Senate. Since each state has two senators, residents of smaller states have more clout in the Senate than residents of larger states. But since 1787, the population disparity between large and small states has grown; in 2006, for example, California had seventy times the population of Wyoming. Critics such as constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson have suggested that the population disparity works against residents of large states and causes a steady <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> from [...] "large states to small states." [...] However, others argue that the Connecticut compromise was deliberately intended by the Framers to construct the Senate so that each state had equal footing not based on population, and contend that the result works well on balance.|$|E
40|$|Background.  The model <b>of</b> {{conflict}} <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> space (territory) {{between a}} pair of opponents {{in the case of}} infinite fractal division of space is investigated. Objective.  The aim of the paper is to consider the problem <b>of</b> conflict <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>resource</b> space, if the opponent presence measures on the space are limited, but not necessarily probabilistic. Methods. To specify the measures of the occupied territories and to find their limiting values a probabilistic approach was applied. Results. The existence of limit values of measures of occupied territories with an infinite increase in the division step is established. The possible values are indicated. Using computer simulation graphs are obtained which show the behavior of the measures of the occupied territories with increasing of the division step. Conclusions. It is shown that the limit values of measures of occupied territories depend only on the selected strategies (that is, the way of structured representation of measures that correspond to each of the opponents) ...|$|R

2500|$|More recent {{criticism}} {{has often been}} academic and limited to particular features. University of Texas law professor Sanford Levinson wonders whether {{it makes sense for}} the Connecticut Compromise to give [...] "Wyoming the same number of votes as California, which has roughly seventy times the population". Levinson thinks this imbalance causes a [...] "steady <b>redistribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> from large states to small states." [...] Levinson is critical of the Electoral College as it allows the possibility of electing presidents who do not win the majority, or even plurality, of votes. Five times in American history, presidents have been elected despite failing to win a plurality of the popular vote: 1824 (John Quincy Adams), 1876 (Rutherford B. Hayes), 1888 (Benjamin Harrison), 2000 (George W. Bush) and 2016 (Donald Trump). The current impeachment powers do not give the people a quick way to remove incompetent or ill presidents, in his view. Others have criticized gerrymandering.|$|E

40|$|Democratic {{practice}} varies historically, and {{transformations of}} the societal context require accompanying reconstructions of democracy if “rule by the people” {{is to remain}} meaningful. Contemporary society is witnessing particularly profound changes in underlying structures of space, governance, and identity. Fundamental reconsideration of democracy is therefore also needed. This article first develops a generic understanding of democracy; next elaborates on currently unfolding transformations of geography, regime, and community; and then develops a five-faceted reconstruction of democracy to meet these changed circumstances. This prescription entails: (1) reconceptualizing democracy, shifting away from obsolete assumptions of territorialist space, statist regulation, and nationalist identity; (2) refashioning civic education to empower all citizens to act in this new situation; (3) building effective institutional mechanisms of public accountability in respect of an emergent polycentric mode of governance; (4) effecting progressive structural <b>redistributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and power in order that all stakeholders in contemporary public policy issues have more equal opportunities of political participation; and (5) nurturing positive practices of intercultural recognition, communication, and negotiation...|$|R
