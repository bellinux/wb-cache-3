40|$|This article {{describes}} a smart antenna system that employs low noise amplifiers and two cascaded Butler Matrices. The output {{signals from the}} first Butler Matrix, which acts as a beamforming network, have high gain and narrowbeam width for long distance communication while the outputs from the second Butler Matrix, which acts as a mirror of the first Butler Matrix, reconstructing the antenna patterns of the individual radiating elements, have high linearity and broad beam width {{that can be used}} for short distance communication. Switching or selecting between the two sets of beams allows reception to be optimized for either vehicle to vehicle or vehicle to <b>roadside</b> <b>beacon</b> communications...|$|E
50|$|Control {{is based}} on sensor {{information}} from on-board sensors. (No existing system makes use of satellite or roadside infrastructures nor of cooperative support from other vehicles.) Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) further extends the automation of navigation by using information gathered from fixed infrastructure such as satellites and <b>roadside</b> <b>beacons,</b> or mobile infrastructure such as reflectors or transmitters {{on the back of}} other vehicles.|$|R

This sum included development (toll system, recording device, etc.), procuring and installing the necessary <b>roadside</b> infrastructure (<b>beacons</b> and associated equipment) and procuring the recording devices.|$|R
40|$|Localization is an {{important}} required task for enabling vehicle autonomy. It entails {{the determination of the}} position of center of mass and orientation of a vehicle from the available measurements. In this paper, we focus on localization by using range measurements available to a vehicle from the communication of its multiple on-board receivers with <b>roadside</b> <b>beacons</b> (acoustic beacons in the case of underwater vehicles). The model proposed for measurements assumes that the true distance between a receiver and a beacon is at most equal to a predetermined function of the range measurement. The proposed procedure for localization is as follows: Based on the range measurements specific to a receiver from the beacons, a convex optimization problem is proposed to estimate the location of the receiver. The estimate is essentially a center of the set of possible locations of the receiver. In the second step, the location estimates of the vehicle are corrected using rigid body motion constraints and the orientation of the rigid body is thus determined. Numerical examples provided at the end corroborate the procedures developed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a test-and-evaluation project {{to evaluate the}} performance of a warning system to mitigate the risk of truck rollover. The warning system, which includes both on-board instrumentation and cooperative infrastructure elements, has been deployed since early this year. The test fleet consists of three tractors and six trailers which run a dedicated route that includes all of I- 75 in Tennessee. The project is a public-private joint venture led by trucking company U. S. Xpress Enterprises, and coordinated by Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Project objectives include testing of all components in a real-world, revenue-service environment, evaluation of the driver interface, and correlation of driver and vehicle behavior with highway geometry and functional characteristics. The warning system includes on-board instrumentation that measures the roll stability of the trailer continuously and determines the location and probable near-term path of the vehicle. In addition, <b>roadside</b> <b>beacons</b> at selected curves on I- 75 broadcast characteristics of the selected curves. Receivers on the trucks accept curve data, and an on-board computer estimates rollover risk based on roll stability, vehicle speed and acceleration, and the lateral acceleration demand of the upcoming curve. If estimated rollover risk exceeds a trucking-company-specified threshold, visible and audible warnings are presented to the driver in time for corrective action to avoid rollover. â€œThis submitted manuscript has been authored by a contractor of the U.

50|$|<b>Roadside</b> radio <b>beacons,</b> or bollards, work by {{transmitting}} data to {{a receiver}} in the car. The beacons constantly transmit data that the car-mounted receiver picks up {{as it passes}} each beacon. This data could include local speed limits, school zones, variable speed limits, or traffic warnings. If sufficient numbers of beacons were used and were placed at regular intervals, they could calculate vehicle speed based on how many beacons the vehicle passed per second. Beacons could be placed in/on speed signs, telegraph poles, other roadside fixtures, or in the road itself. Mobile beacons could be deployed in order to override fixed beacons for use around accident scenes, during poor weather, or during special events. Beacons could be linked to a main computer so that quick changes could be made.|$|R
40|$|The {{principal}} {{objective of this}} project was to collect and analyze vehicle and highway data {{that are relevant to}} the problem of truck rollover crashes, and in particular to the subset of rollover crashes that are caused by the driver error of entering a curve at a speed too great to allow safe completion of the turn. The data are of two sorts [...] vehicle dynamic performance data, and highway geometry data as revealed by vehicle behavior in normal driving. Vehicle dynamic performance data are relevant because the roll stability of a tractor trailer depends both on inherent physical characteristics of the vehicle and on the weight and distribution of the particular cargo that is being carried. Highway geometric data are relevant because the set of crashes of primary interest to this study are caused by lateral acceleration demand in a curve that exceeds the instantaneous roll stability of the vehicle. An analysis of data quality requires an evaluation of the equipment used to collect the data because the reliability and accuracy of both the equipment and the data could profoundly affect the safety of the driver and other highway users. Therefore, a concomitant objective was an evaluation of the performance of the set of data-collection equipment on the truck and trailer. The objective concerning evaluation of the equipment was accomplished, but the results were not entirely positive. Significant engineering apparently remains to be done before a reliable system can be fielded. Problems were identified with the trailer to tractor fiber optic connector used for this test. In an over-the-road environment, the communication between the trailer instrumentation and the tractor must be dependable. In addition, the computer in the truck must be able to withstand the rigors of the road. The major objective [...] data collection and analysis [...] was also accomplished. Using data collected by instruments on the truck, a ''bad-curve'' database can be generated. Using this database, instrumented vehicles would not need <b>roadside</b> <b>beacons.</b> The speed, acceleration, and roll stability of the vehicle could be determined prior to entering a curve, and a warning issued, if appropriate, for curves that have been characterized in the database. Thus, the analysis indicates that the data can be effectively used to provide a timely warning of rollover risk...|$|R
