It optimizes the existing bus <b>route</b> <b>scheduling</b> management model according to Ant Colony algorithm, enhances {{the performance of}} both Ant Colony algorithm and the traditional scheduling model, and improves the optimal performance of the combining algorithm. The experiment results show that, the proposed algorithm can effectively deal with the bus <b>route</b> <b>scheduling</b> management, and the optimization result obtained is obviously better than the traditional algorithms. Furthermore, it solve the problems exist in the traditional algorithms, therefore has great application value. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} problem of <b>route</b> <b>scheduling</b> under the {{telephone}} model of com-munication networks. Previous work in this model considered mostly the “broadcast ” and “gossip ” communication primitives. The approach studied here is that of devising simple, distributed universal schedules, that are efficient for wide families of routing instances, rather than attempting to solve individual instances separately. The paper concentrates on “traf-fic-fight ” type <b>schedules</b> for <b>route</b> <b>scheduling</b> on the two-dimensional grid. In order to study {{the problem of}} <b>scheduling</b> given <b>route</b> instances, routes are classified according {{to the number of}} directions they use, and tight bounds are given on the time required for <b>scheduling</b> <b>route</b> instances in each class. For routes of length d or less, using only one direction, scheduling is shown to require d + O(1) time. For simple routes using only two or three directions, scheduling is shown to require 2 d + 3 and 2 d + 4 time, respectively. Finally, for arbitrary simple <b>routes</b> <b>scheduling</b> is shown to require 2 d + O(Jd) time. 1...|$|R

40|$|The United States Air Force's Air Mobility Command is {{responsible}} for creating a schedule and executing that schedule for a large-scale air mobility network that encompasses different mission areas. One of the mission areas is channel route. Channel route execution often experiences disruptions that motivate a need {{for changes in the}} current channel <b>route</b> <b>schedule.</b> Traditionally, re-planning the channel <b>route</b> <b>schedule</b> has been a manual process that usually stops after the first feasible set of changes is found, due to the challenges of large amounts of data and urgency for a re-plan. Other challenges include subjective trade-offs and a desire for minimal changes to the channel <b>route</b> <b>schedule.</b> We re-plan the channel <b>route</b> <b>schedule</b> using a set of integer programs and heuristics that overcomes these challenges. The integer programs' variables incorporate many of Air Mobility Command's operating constraints, so {{they do not have to}} be explicitly included in the formulations. The re-plan uses opportunities in the other mission areas and reroutes channel route aircraft. Finally, our methods can quickly find a solution, allow for "what-if' analysis and interaction with the user, and can be adapted to an evolution in Air Mobility Command's operations while the underlying models remain constant. by Corbin G.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a tactical-level liner ship <b>route</b> <b>schedule</b> design problem which aims to {{determine}} the arrival time of a ship at each portcall on a ship route and the sailing speed function on each voyage leg by taking into account time uncertainties at sea and at port. It first derives the optimality condition for the sailing speed function with sea contingency and subsequently demonstrates the convexity of the bunker consumption function. A mixed-integer non-linear stochastic programming model is developed for the proposed liner ship <b>route</b> <b>schedule</b> design problem by minimizing the ship cost and expected bunker cost while maintaining a required transit time service level. In view of the special structure of the model, an exact cutting-plane based solution algorithm is proposed.

40|$|The {{time control}} point {{strategy}} is often adopted by bus operators in China and Singapore {{to provide more}} reliable transit service. It is thus important to design a schedule, in which bus drivers should devote their efforts to catch up a scheduled arrival time at a predetermined time control point on a bus route because passengers can definitely benefit from a reliable bus <b>route</b> <b>schedule.</b> This paper first proposes a novel reliable bus <b>route</b> <b>schedule</b> design problem by {{taking into account the}} bus travel time uncertainty and the bus drivers’ schedule recovery efforts. It proceeds to develop a robust optimization model for the proposed problem, which aims to minimize the sum of the expected value of the random schedule deviation and its variability multiplied by a weighting value. A Monte Carlo simulation based solution method is subsequently designed to solve the robust optimization model. Finally, a numerical example based on a real bus route in Suzhou city of China is carried out to demonstrate the strength of the robust optimization model. We find that the optimal scheduled travel time (or slack time) depends on bus drivers’ schedule recovery behavior and on decision makers’ scheduling philosophies...|$|E

40|$|CD 22 is a cell-surface {{adhesion}} molecule on most B-cell NHL, {{so it is}} a promising target for immunotherapy. HB 22. 7 is an anti-CD 22 mAb that binds the two NH 2 -terminal immunoglobulin domains and specifically blocks the interaction of CD 22 with its ligand. CD 22 -blocking mAbs induce apoptosis in neoplastic B-cells and are functionally distinguishable from other anti-CD 22 mAbs. This study assessed the optimal dose, <b>route,</b> <b>schedule,</b> and the targeted CD 22 epitope. Raji NHL-bearing nude mice were studied. A non-blocking anti-CD 22 mAb (HB 22. 27) was used as a control. HB 22. 27 had minimal effect, whereas HB 22. 7 improved survival and shrank tumors substantially. HB 22. 7 doses greater than 1. 4  mg/week did not further increase efficacy (or toxicity). Tumors less than 200  mm 3 had a higher response rate than did larger tumors. Various schedules of HB 22. 7 administration were tested; one dose every other week was more effective than more or less frequent dosing. Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the half-life of HB 22. 7 was 28  days; this correlated with the time needed to re-populate cell-surface CD 22 after treatment with HB 22. 7. Immuno-PET showed that NHL was rapidly and specifically targeted by copper- 64 -labeled-HB 22. 7.
