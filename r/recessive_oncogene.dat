40|$|AbstractObjective: The {{standard}} {{treatment of}} patients with stage I non–small cell lung cancer is resection of the primary tumor; however, the recurrence rate is 28 % to 45 %. This study evaluates a panel of molecular markers in a large population {{of patients with}} stage I non–small cell lung cancer to determine the prognostic value of each marker {{and to create a}} biologic risk model. Methods: Pathologic specimens were collected from 408 consecutive patients after complete resection for stage I non–small cell lung cancer at a single institution, with follow-up of at least 5 years. A panel of 10 molecular markers was chosen for immunohistochemical analysis of the primary tumor on the basis of differing oncogenic mechanisms. Local tumor expansion requires growth regulating proteins (epidermal growth factor receptor, the protooncogene erb-b 2); apoptosis proteins (p 53, bcl- 2); and cell cycle regulating proteins (retinoblastoma <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene,</b> KI- 67). Local tumor invasion requires angiogenesis (factor viii). The development of distant metastases involves the expression of adhesion proteins (CD- 44, sialyl-Tn, blood group A). Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to construct an independent risk model for cancer recurrence and death. Results: Multivariable analysis demonstrated significantly elevated risk for the following molecular markers: p 53 (hazard ratio, 1. 68; P =. 004); factor viii (hazard ratio, 1. 47 P =. 033); erb-b 2 (hazard ratio, 1. 43; P =. 044); CD- 44 (hazard ratio, 1. 40; P =. 050); and retinoblastoma <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> (hazard ratio, 0. 747; P =. 084). Conclusions: Five molecular markers were associated with the risk of recurrence and death, representing independent metastatic pathways: apoptosis (p 53), angiogenesis (factor viii), growth regulation (erb-b 2), adhesion (CD- 44), and cell cycle regulation (retinoblastoma <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene).</b> This study demonstrates the validity of this molecular biologic risk model in patients with stage I non– small cell lung cancer.

40|$|Familial cylindromatosis is an {{autosomal}} dominant genetic predisposition to multiple tumours {{of the skin}} appendages. The susceptibility gene (CYLD) has previously been localized to chromosome 16 q and has the genetic attributes of a tumour-suppressor gene (<b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene).</b> Here we have identified CYLD by detecting germline mutations in 21 cylindromatosis families and somatic mutations in 1 sporadic and 5 familial cylindromas. All mutations predict truncation or absence of the encoded protein. CYLD encodes three cytoskeletal-associated-protein-glycine-conserved (CAP-GLY) domains, which are found in proteins that coordinate the attachment of organelles to microtubules. CYLD also has sequence homology to the catalytic domain of ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolases (UCH) ...|$|E
40|$|A small {{proportion}} of breast cancer is attributable to the inheritance of dominant, high penetrance susceptibility genes. One of these genes, BRCA 2, has recently been localised by genetic linkage analysis to chromosome 13 q 12 - 13. This is a region known to exhibit loss of heterozygosity in 20 - 40 % sporadic breast cancers. In this study, are have examined cancers from a family showing strong evidence of linkage to BRCA 2. LOH was seen in seven out of eight informative cancers. In all cases the allele lost was the wild type allele that does not segregate with the disease in the family. The data suggest that both alleles of BRCA 2 are inactivated in cancers, the pattern expected of a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> or tumour suppressor gene...|$|E
40|$|Cancer cells contain {{genetic damage}} {{that can lead}} to tumorigenesis. Genetic damage found in cancer cells is of two types: {{dominant}} and the genes are termed protooncogenes; and recessive and the genes are termed tumor or growth suppressors, <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogenes</b> or anti-oncogenes. Oncogene proteins are a specific group of growth factors that promotes uncontrolled cell growth and proliferation. These proteins are derived from normal proto-oncogenes via a limited number of modifications, i. e mutations, insertions or deletions. Because proto-oncogenes control the cell cycle, it is obvious that should a proto-oncogene be mutated the potential for an unregulated cell cycle results. Therefore, a structure-function analysis of oncogene proteins is of great importance in understanding cell transformation that causes cancer development. In this paper we present and discuss the use of two related computational techniques for analysis of ras oncongene protein example. We showed that the methods are efficient for accurate prediction of the protein active/binding site locations critical for its bioactivity, i. e. cell transformation...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the past}} decade a large {{repertoire}} of cellular oncogenes has been implicated in the genesis of many types of cancers. These oncogenes all function to promote the neoplastic growth of cells in which they act. Indeed, they all appear to derive from normal cell genes, proto-oncogenes, which act to stimulate normal cell proliferation. During this period, evidence has also been presented to suggest that elements that normally function to inhibit cell proliferation are also {{playing a role in}} the process of carcinogenesis. For instance, in a number of distinct types of tumors it was found that genetic material from specific chromosomal loci was absent in tumor DNAs, but present in the adjacent normal cell DNA. This indicates that loss of genetic material represents at least one step in the pathogenesis of these tumors. It seems likely that the normal function of the genes that are lost in these tumors is to restrain the growth of cells from which the tumors originate. For this reason such genes have been named <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogenes</b> or anti-oncogenes...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogenes</b> {{such as those}} {{responsible}} for retinoblastoma and Wilms tumor is difficult because the gene products involved are unknown and because the diseases are not associated with unique cellular or molecular phenotypes suitable for genetic manipulation. Since the gene for esterase D (ESD) {{is known to be}} tightly linked to the retinoblastoma locus (RB 1) in the q 14. 1 band of chromosome 13, we have cloned the ESD gene from a human cDNA library by using oligonucleotides specific for a partial amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme to provide a genetic marker for further studies on retinoblastoma. The putative ESD gene codes for a message of 1. 2 kilobases, which is present in all cell types examined, and maps to 13 q 14. 1, thus confirming that it is the ESD gene. Restriction enzyme analysis reveals a restriction fragment length polymorphism with Apa I; this polymorphism results from the heterozygosity of 32 % of the individuals tested and is shown to be useful in identifying carriers of the mutation responsible for retinoblastoma. A preliminary screen of 24 retinoblastoma tumors by Southern blot did not reveal any homologous deletions or rearrangements of the ESD locus...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{advances}} {{in all areas}} of treatment, lung cancer re-mains the greatest cancer killer {{of men and women in}} the United States (1). Of the approximately 178 000 new lung cancer cases developing in the United States in 1997, approximately 15 % will be alive 5 years later. Antismoking efforts remain the best pre-ventive approach. Unfortunately, screening with chest x ray and sputum cytology, while picking up stage lor stage II lung can-cers, does not lead to altered survival because of the tendency of lung cancer to metastasize early. There has been continued prog-ress in understanding the molecular abnormalities underlying the pathogenesis of lung cancer with identification of altered dom-inant and recessive oncogenes, genetic instability, and growth factor-linked signal transduction pathways (2). In addition, sev-eral groups recently have provided evidence of clonal genetic alterations in known or suspected <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> sites i...|$|E
40|$|Retinoblastoma is a {{childhood}} tumor that can arise because of mutant alleles acquired as somatic or germinal mutations. The mutant allele {{can be carried}} in the germ line. The mutations creating these alleles act by inactivating copies of a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> located within band q 14 of chromosome 13 and termed the RB 1 locus. We have reported isolation of a cDNA fragment that recognizes chromosomal sequences possessing many of the attributes of the retinoblastoma gene associated with the RB 1 locus. We now report that this segment is additionally the target of somatic mutations in mesenchymal tumors among patients having no apparent predisposition to retinoblastoma and no previous evidence of retinoblastoma. These tumors provide additional evidence that the cloned sequences are representative of a gene that is a frequent target of inactivation during tumorigenesis. Sequence analysis of this cDNA provides little insight into its normal functional role...|$|E
40|$|The {{retinoblastoma}} gene (RUl) is a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> implicated {{in a number}} of human tumors. Although the RB 1 gene is expressed in most proliferating cells, there is considerable evidence for the transcriptional regulation of this gene. Therefore, we have performed a detailed analysis of the regulatory elements in the promoter of the human RB 1 gene. Deletion analysis of the 5 ’ upstream region determined the location of the basal promoter to be between- 208 and- 1 79 nucleotides relative to the translational start. This region contains essential binding sites for the transcription elements ATF and su and potentially important sites for E 2 F and steroid hormone responsiveness but no TATA or CAAT boxes. Primer extension and RNase protection analysis identified two initiation sites at- 1 76 and- 1 28 base pairs, both downstream of the promoter. Cotransfection experiments revealed repression of the RIJi promoter by its protein produd pu u 0 R 81 #{ 149 } This repression has been mapped to the core promoter region containing the E 2 F-binding site; however, this site is not required for autorepression...|$|E
40|$|The genomes {{of various}} tumor cells contain mutant oncogenes that act dominantly, in that their {{effects can be}} {{observed}} when they are introduced into non-malignent cells. There is evidence for another class of oncogenes, in which tumour-predisposing mutations are recessive to wild-type alleles. Retinoblastoma is a prototype biological model {{for the study of}} such <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogenes.</b> This malignant tumour, which arises in the eyes of children, can be explained as the result of two distinct genetic changes, each causing loss of function of one of the two homologous copies at a single genetic locus, Rb, assigned to the q 14 band of human chromosome 13. Mutations affecting this locus may be inherited from a parent, may arise during gametogenesis or may occur somatically. Those who inherit a mutant allele at this locus have a high incidence of non-ocular, second tumours, almost half of which are osteosarcomas believed to be caused by the same mutation. Here we describe the isolation of a complementary DNA segment that detects a chromosomal segment having the properties of the gene at this locus. The gene is expressed in many tumour types, but no RNA transcript has been found in retinoblastomas and osteosarcomas. The cDNA fragment detects a locus spanning at least 70 kilobases (kb) in human chromosome band 13 q 14, all or part of which is frequently deleted in retinoblastomas and osteosarcomas...|$|R
40|$|Homozygous deletions of {{recessive}} cancer {{genes and}} fragile sites {{are known to}} occur in human cancers. We identified 281 homozygous deletions in 636 cancer cell lines. Of these deletions, 86 were homozygous deletions of known recessive cancer genes, 17 were of sequenced common fragile sites, and 178 were in genomic regions that do not overlap known <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogenes</b> or fragile sites (“unexplained” homozygous deletions). Some cancer cell lines have multiple homozygous deletions whereas others have none, suggesting intrinsic variation in the tendency to develop this type of genetic abnormality (P < 0. 001). The 178 unexplained homozygous deletions clustered into 131 genomic regions, 27 of which exhibit homozygous deletions {{in more than one}} cancer cell line. This degree of clustering indicates that the genomic positions of the unexplained homozygous deletions are not randomly determined (P < 0. 001). Many homozygous deletions, including those that are in multiple clusters, do not overlap known genes and appear to be in intergenic DNA. Therefore, to elucidate further the pathogenesis of homozygous deletions in cancer, we investigated the genome landscape within unexplained homozygous deletions. The gene count within homozygous deletions is low compared {{with the rest of the}} genome. There are also fewer short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), and low-copy-number repeats (LCRs). However, DNA within homozygous deletions has higher flexibility. These features may signal the presence of currently unrecognized zones of susceptibility to DNA rearrangement. They may also reflect a tendency to reduce the adverse effects of homozygous deletions by minimizing the number of genes removed...|$|R
5000|$|Unlike oncogenes, tumor {{suppressor}} genes generally {{follow the}} [...] "two-hit hypothesis," [...] which implies that both alleles that code {{for a particular}} protein must be affected before an effect is manifested. This is because if only one allele for the gene is damaged, the second can still produce the correct protein. In other words, mutant tumor suppressors' alleles are usually <b>recessive</b> whereas mutant <b>oncogene</b> alleles are typically dominant.|$|R
40|$|Sixty-five {{percent of}} acute myeloid leukemias subtype M 2 (AML-M 2), {{displaying}} a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 21 (t 8; 21), have also lost one or other {{copy of the}} sex chromosomes (XO). This finding {{has led to the}} hypothesis that a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> may he present in the DNA common to both sex chromosomes, that is the pseudoautosomal region. The alpha chain of the receptor for the hemopoietic growth factor GM-CSF has recently been mapped to the human pseudoautosomal region and, given the role of this molecule in the control of normal hemopoiesis, it is thought to be a good candidate gene. This paper examines the structure, expression, and sequence of the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain gene (GMR alpha) in three primary AML-M 2,XO samples and one AML-M 2,XO cell line. Results of this work show no gross rearrangement or loss of the remaining allele of GMR alpha, detectable expression of its transcript and protein, and no changes at the nucleotide sequence level. Thus, we find no evidence to support a role for the GM-CSF receptor alpha chain molecule in the development of AML-M 2,XO leukemias...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} pathology of somatotrophinomas {{has been investigated}} by a combined search for dominant mutations of the gene encoding the Gs alpha protein and for recessive mutations involving chromosome 11 q 13, which contains the gene causing multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN 1). Somatotrophinomas and peripheral leukocytes were obtained from thirteen patients with acromegaly; one patient also suffered from MEN 1. Five DNA probes identifying restriction fragment length polymorphisms from 11 q revealed allele loss in pituitary tumors from five (four non-MEN 1 and one MEN 1) patients. Deletion mapping revealed that the region of allele loss common to the somatotrophinomas involved 11 q 13. An analysis for similar allelic deletions at 12 other loci from chromosomes 1 - 5, 7 - 9, 12 - 14, and 17 did not reveal generalized allele loss in the somatotrophinomas. These results, which represent the first report of chromosome 11 allele loss occurring in non-MEN 1 somatotrophinomas, indicate that a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> on 11 q 13 is specifically involved in the monoclonal development of somatotrophinomas. In addition Gs alpha mutations were detected in two non-MEN 1 somatotrophinomas, one of which also revealed allele loss of chromosome 11. Thus, our results reveal {{that the development of}} somatotrophinomas is associated with alterations in both dominant and recessive oncogenes and further characterization of these genetic abnormalities will help to elucidate the multistep etiology and progression of somatotrophinomas...|$|E
40|$|The {{association}} of the cellular p 53 protein with the E 1 B- 55 kd protein of adenovirus 5 (Ad 5) is thought to result in inactivation of the p 53 <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> product. Here we show that Ad 5 E 1 -transformed 3 Y 1 rat cells which express low levels of the 55 kd E 1 B protein do not contain the p 53 -E 1 B 55 kd complex. These cells have nuclearly located p 53 and are highly oncogenic in nude mice. In 3 Y 1 cells expressing the E 1 B protein at a sufficiently high level, association between p 53 and E 1 B- 55 kd occurs, resulting in an almost complete trapping of p 53 into a discrete cytoplasmic body. These cells only form tumors after a very long latency period and in the tumors that eventually appear selection has occurred in favor of cells lacking the complex and containing free nuclear p 53. Comparable results were found when highly oncogenic Ad 12 -transformed cells were supertransfected with the Ad 5 E 1 B region. In none of the Ad-transformed mouse, rat and human cell lines examined, could we detect p 53 of abnormal molecular weight or association with hsc 70, neither could we immunoprecipitate p 53 by the mutant specific antibody PAb 240. These data suggest that {{a high level of}} nuclear p 53 with a wild-type conformation contributes to the oncogenicity of Ad transformed cells...|$|E
40|$|Synthetic peptide {{substrates}} for {{the cell}} division cycle regulated protein kinase, p 34 cdc 2, {{have been developed}} and characterized. These peptides {{are based on the}} sequences of two known substrates of the enzyme, Simian Virus 40 Large T antigen and the human cellular <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> product, p 53. The peptide sequences are H-A-D-A-Q-H-A-T-P-P-K-K-K-R-K-V-E-D-P-K-D-F-OH (T antigen) and H-K-R-A-L-P-N-N-T-S-S-S-P-Q-P-K-K-K-P-L-D-G-E-Y-NH 2 (p 53), and they have been employed in a rapid assay of phosphorylation in vitro. Both peptides show linear kinetics and an apparent Km of 74 and 120 microM, respectively, for the purified human enzyme. The T antigen peptide is specifically phosphorylated by p 34 cdc 2 and not by seven other protein serine/threonine kinases, chosen because they represent major classes of such enzymes. The peptides have been used in whole cell lysates to detect protein kinase activity, and the cell cycle variation of this activity is comparable to that measured with specific immune and affinity complexes of p 34 cdc 2. In addition, the peptide phosphorylation detected in mitotic cells is depleted by affinity adsorption of p 34 cdc 2 using either antibodies to p 34 cdc 2 or by immobilized p 13, a p 34 cdc 2 -binding protein. Purification of peptide kinase activity from mitotic HeLa cells yields an enzyme indistinguishable from p 34 cdc 2. These peptides should be useful in the investigation of p 34 cdc 2 protein kinase and their regulation throughout the cell division cycle...|$|E
40|$|Tumor {{formation}} {{may result}} from the activation of dominant oncogenes or by inactivation of recessive, tumor suppressor genes. The role of such mutations {{in the development of}} pituitary tumors has been studied. Tumors from 88 patients, representing the 4 major classes of adenoma, were investigated. In DNA extracted from matched leukocyte and tumor samples, allelic deletions were sought with 15 probes identifying restriction fragment length polymorphisms on chromosomes 1, 5, 10, 11, 13, 17, 20, and 22. Evidence of amplification or rearrangement of 10 recognized cellular oncogenes (N-ras, mycL 1, mycN, myc, H-ras, bcl 1, H-stf 1, sea, kraS 2, and fos) was sought in tumor DNA. Activating dominant mutations of Gs alpha were detected using the polymerase chain reaction to amplify exons 7 - 10 and hybridizing the product to normal and mutant allele-specific oligonucleotides. Allelic deletions on chromosome 11 were identified in 16 tumors (18 %) representing all 4 major subtypes. Deletions on other autosomes were observed in less than 6 % of tumors. Three adenomas had deletions on multiple autosomes, 2 of these were aggressive and recurrent. Mutations of Gs alpha were confirmed to be specific to somatotrophinomas, being identified in 36 % of such tumors in this series. No evidence of amplification or rearrangement of other recognized cellular oncogenes was found. Inactivation of a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene</b> on chromosome 11 is an important and possibly early event {{in the development of the}} four major types of pituitary adenoma, whereas activating mutations of Gs alpha are confirmed to be specific to somatotropinomas. Two aggressive tumors were found to have multiple autosomal losses, suggesting a multistep progression in the development of tumors of this phenotype...|$|E
40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{the role of the}} p 53 gene in oncogenesis in vivo by generating transgenic mice carrying murine p 53 genomic fragments isolated from a mouse Friend erythroleukemia cell line or BALB/c mouse liver DNA. Elevated levels of p 53 mRNA were detected in several tissues of two transgenic lines tested. Increased levels of p 53 protein were also detected in most of the tissues analyzed by Western blotting (immunoblotting). Because both transgenes encoded p 53 proteins that were antigenically distinct from wild-type p 53, it was possible to demonstrate that overexpression of the p 53 protein was mostly, if not entirely, due to the expression of the transgenes. Neoplasms developed in 20 % of the transgenic mice, with a high incidence of lung adenocarcinomas, osteosarcomas, and lymphomas. Tissues such as ovaries that expressed the transgene at high levels were not at higher risk of malignant transformation than tissues expressing p 53 protein at much lower levels. The long latent period and low penetrance suggest that overexpression of p 53 alone is not sufficient to induce malignancies and that additional events are required. These observations provide direct evidence that mutant alleles of the p 53 oncogene have oncogenic potential in vivo and that different cell types show intrinsic differences in susceptibility to malignant transformation by p 53. Since recent data suggest that p 53 may be a <b>recessive</b> <b>oncogene,</b> {{it is possible that the}} elevated tumor incidence results from functional inactivation of endogenous p 53 by overexpression of the mutant transgene. The high incidence of lung and bone tumors suggests that p 53 transgenic mice may provide a useful model to investigate the molecular events that underlie these malignancies in humans...|$|E
