40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of a mixer {{is dependent on the}} size of the tank to be mixed, the characteristics of the waste, and the operating conditions. Waste tanks throughout the U. S. Department of Energy Complex require mixing and mobilization systems capable of (1) breaking up and suspending materials that are difficult to mix and pump, without introducing additional liquids into the tank; (2) complementing and augmenting the performance of other remotely operated and/or robotic waste retrieval systems; and (3) operating in tanks with various quantities of waste. The Oak Ridge Russian pulsating mixer pump (PMP) system was designed with the flexibility to permit deployment in a variety of cylindrical tanks. The PMP was installed at the Tanks Technology Cold Test Facility at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) to assess the performance of the system over an extended range of operating conditions, including supply pressures up to 175 psig. Previously conducted cold tests proved the applicability of the PMP for deployment in ORNL gunite tank TH- 4. The previous testing and hot demonstrations had been limited to operating at air supply pressures of < 100 psig. The extended cold testing of the Russian PMP system showed that the system was capable of mobilizing waste simulants in tanks in excess of 20 -ft diam. The waste simulant used in these tests was medium-grain quartz sand. The system was successfully installed, checked out, and operated for 406 pulse discharge cycles. Only minor problems (i. e., a sticking air <b>distributor</b> <b>valve</b> and a few system lockups) were noted. Some improvements to the design of the air <b>distributor</b> <b>valve</b> may be needed to improve reliability. The air supply requirements of the PMP during the discharge cycle necessitated the operation of the system in single pulse discharge cycles to allow time for the air supply reservoir to recharge to the required pressure. During the test program, the system was operated with sand depths of 2, 4, and 4. 5 in.; at operating pressures from 100 to 175 psig; and elevations of 1 to 10 in. off the floor of the mock tank. The higher operating pressures resulted in larger values for the effective cleaning radius (ECR). The maximum observed ECR value, 144 in., occurred with the PMP elevated {approx} 4 in. off the floor of the mock tank; a 2 -in. layer of sand as the waste simulant, and 175 -psig air supply pressure. Tests were conducted both within the confines of the 20 -ft diam mock tank (confined) and with a portion of the tank wall removed (unconfined). The mixing mode during the confined tests changed from direct to indirect as the PMP was elevated above 4 in. off the floor of the mock tank. The direct mode of mixing pushes solids toward the wall of the waste tank, while the indirect mode tends to push solids toward the center of the tank. The mixing mode did not change during tests conducted in the unconfined tank. Changing the mode of mixing from direct to indirect should have a beneficial effect on the amount of solids mobilized and retrieved from a waste tank...|$|R
40|$|Hydraulic {{systems are}} often {{subjected}} to pressure drops, which {{may lead to}} cavitation. In systems such as power steering, hoist loads, or ventricular assist devices, distributors are generally used. Significant pressure losses can happen in a distributor due to gap and overlap, which may lead to cavitation development. However, this issue is almost never included in the conception of the distributors. In this study, the multibubble model of the modified Rayleigh–Plesset equation {{is applied to the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>distributor</b> of an oil hydraulic system. The influence of the overlap length, the gap, the rotation speed, and distributor inlet pressure on the cavitation and particularly the interactions between bubbles at cavitation inception are studied. The study highlights a critical length of the overlap; over this value, the overlap length influences significantly the cavitation duration and the void fraction. More generally, some geometrical details have a strong influence on cavitation. Optimization of these details in engine parts, taking account the occurrence of cavitation, would be an appropriate solution to reduce its effects. The study also demonstrates that the growth of small bubbles may be delayed by the interactions with the nearby bigger ones, even if the ambient pressure is lower than their theoretical critical pressure. They eventually collapse at the first moments of the cavitation development. However, if the ambient pressure drops further, that is, beyond a critical pressure, a small bubble gains enough inertial energy to overcome these interaction phenomena and thus to grow. The growth of small bubbles increases the interactions between bubbles and slows down the growth of nearby bigger ones. The results show that the interactions between bubbles are of primary importance in the first moments of the cavitation development, which suggests that they should be taken into account in the definition of the critical pressure...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{a study of}} the performance of an industrial low-speed high-torque hydrostatic drive system. This type of hydrostatic transmission is commonly used in continuous operation {{in a wide range of}} heavy-duty drive applications. In many applications the transmissions have to compete with e. g. electromechanical drives, such as DC or AC electric motors combined with gearboxes. In such situations, energy efficiency is a key selection criterion in that even a small increase in the efficiency of high power industrial drives would give substantial savings. Apart from efficiency, lifetime and reliability requirements are important parameters for industrial drive systems, as unplanned stops in industrial working processes can be very costly. The work presented in this thesis is primarily focused on analysing the efficiency behaviour in the transmission, both on the system level and on the component level. Attention has also been paid to lifetime issues, with special emphasis on wear occurring in a sliding contact in a radial piston hydraulic motor. In Paper A the distribution of power losses in a variable axial piston swash plate pump is investigated. The pump under study is commonly used in stationary industrial hydrostatic transmission systems. The churning losses in the pump have been estimated experimentally by measurements in a test rig. The leakage flow and the power losses in the contacts between the piston and the cylinder and between the slipper and the swash plate respectively were simulated with the help of the simulation tool CASPAR. For the pump studied, the churning losses are significant under the operating conditions typically occurring in industrial drive applications. The simulation results indicate that the leakage to the pump casing mainly originates from the gaps between the pistons and their respective cylinders and between the slippers and swash plate. The aim of Paper B is to study two sliding contacts inside a radial piston hydraulic motor and investigate their influence on the torque and power losses. Moreover, it is investigated whether and when a change in the lubrication regime can be expected in these contacts. This is accomplished by a combination of experimental and theoretical studies, with a special focus on two lubricated sliding contacts: the <b>distributor</b> <b>valve</b> contact and the piston/cam roller contact. The theoretical analysis of the contacts indicates, among other things, that the piston/cam roller contact can enter the mixed lubrication regime at low motor speeds. At low running speeds, an increased wear rate has been noted in the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in a radial piston hydraulic motor. Paper C describes a comparative investigation into different hydraulic fluids' friction properties and wear protection abilities. To simulate the contact between the cylinder bore and the piston skirt in the hydraulic motor, tests were performed in a reciprocating test rig where the contact geometry was of the cylinder-plate type. In the model test a synthetic ester aimed at meeting the conditions in water turbine applications received a top ranking regarding both friction and wear protection properties.
