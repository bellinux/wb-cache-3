40|$|On a <b>recent</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{visit to}} a local public library, I {{happened}} to pass by the very inviting wing where children’s and young adult books were housed. Prominently displayed {{near the entrance to}} this part of the library was a large, multi-colored poster that announced the literary challenge ‘Read To Win! ’ Directly beneath these twelve- inch-high words were the details outlining what constituted children’s reading success. Youngsters who read ten books during the summer months were honored with a certificate of accomplishment from a local pizza chain and a coupon for one free Pizza Supreme. Those who read twenty books were awarded a similar certificate and three free Supreme pizzas). Finally, those youngsters who read more than thirty books were awarded the certificate, still more Supremes, and a cap emblazoned with the words ‘Champion Reader. ’ This kind of poster, I suspect, might be readily found in any library anywhere these days, and so its familiarity should not have been at all surprising. As it was, however, this announcement took {{on a life of its}} own in my mind, and I found myself feeling slightly disconcerted by what I’d just encountered. I could not help but wonder about this representation of reading’s purpose and power, and about some of the ways this purpose and power is communicated to children and adults alike. How, I more specificall...|$|E

50|$|In {{contrast}} to his earlier works, which focused on demons and death, his recent works frequently feature animals or recurring images of forests. Hs most <b>recent</b> publication, <b>Afternoon</b> With a Faun, contains three linked stories, titled “Animals’ Songs of Boredom or Anger.” In the stories, owls, cats, rabbits, fish, and other animals appear, along with the forest in which they live. In “Something With a Chicken,” even a contemptuous myna bird makes an appearance. The denial of human values spurs an interest in “beings that are not human.” His works, which disrupt the distinctions between reality and fantasy, human and inhuman, meaning and non-meaning, {{can be understood as}} scorn towards an absurd social reality. In that sense, his works are frequently compared to Kafka’s.|$|R

40|$|The Medicare Select {{proposal}} {{has opened up}} a new front in the health debate, reports Melissa Sweet in Inside Story ONE <b>RECENT</b> Sunday <b>afternoon,</b> after several weeks of feeling poorly, I made the uncomfortable transition from being an observer of the health system to a user of it. As I took off my clothes, put on the green gown provided by the hospital, and followed the instructions for having an X-ray, I felt terribly vulnerable. Was {{this going to be}} one of those moments in which everything changes? Fortunately, my fears were groundless, and I was soon restored to my usual sense of self. But the unsettling experience was a timely reminder of why health policy – an area often obfuscated by impenetrable jargon and self-interested powerbrokers – matters so much. Even if you find health policy debates mind-numbingly dull – as news editors have been complaining in the United States, where even the Obama factor is not enough to stop audiences switching off – there will come a time when they are suddenly, awfully relevant [...] .

40|$|Mona Simpson writes novels. Her 1987 debut, Anywhere But Here, follows Adele and Ann August, {{a mother}} and {{daughter}} who move from the Midwest to Los Angeles {{in search of a}} less ordinary life. The novel went on to be a national bestseller, winning the Whiting Award in 1986, catapulting the author into the literary spotlight. Simpson followed her first novel’s success with a sequel: The Lost Father, published in 1992. Four years later, Simpson returned with A Regular Guy (1996). That same year Granta named Simpson one of America’s Best Young Novelists. In 2000, Simpson published Off Keck Road, a novel about a small town spinster, a man who has always been in her life, and a young girl, who completes the odd triangle. This work was a finalist for the PEN/Faulkner Award. Her upcoming novel, My Hollywood (Knopf, Spring 2010), depicts the upstairs/downstairs ironies, enmities, and strange affections between a community of immigrant nannies and their employers in contemporary Los Angeles. Presently, Simpson has begun a story about the lives and loves of Diaspora Arabs in Europe, the Gulf, and the United States, and of their more assimilated, half-American cousins. Simpson is also a Professor in the Department of English and plays an active part in organizing the Friends of English and Hammer Museum’s popular “Some Favorite Writers” series. On a <b>recent</b> summer <b>afternoon,</b> I sat down in a Brentwood coffee shop with Simpson to talk about her work and, in particular, The American Cousins...|$|R
40|$|The massive museum, {{a modern}} {{structure}} of grey bricks and white-painted cement, stands a little abruptly, halfway up Xiayun Mountain, in Fangshang County, in western skirts of Beijing. It is the ‘Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China Museum’, dedicated entirely to this revolutionary song. On a <b>recent</b> sunny <b>afternoon,</b> {{when a friend}} and I descended – or should I say ascended as the mountain, at 2161 meter above sea level, is known as ‘the roof of Beijing’ – we found ourselves the only visitors. The spacious car park was empty. Yiaotangshang, a quiet mountain village, isn’t on any tourist map. Now it is poised {{to go down in}} history as the birthplace of the most famous revolutionary song in China. The museum complex felt like a mini-‘Red Base’. By the foot of the mountain, three national flags flapped in the chill wind. In the main hall, staves of the song’s music, in gold, glared on a red wall, behind a golden hammer and sickle. As someone who grew up in China and knows the lyrics by heart, I couldn’t help but start to sing aloud, to the amusement of the museum staff. In the revolutionary spirit and against the market economy trend, entrance is free. The museum is made up of three separate parts. Here photos, documents, statues and wax figures enlighten visitors of the song’s history, its composer Cao Huoxing, and the glorious history of Chinese Communist Party. It also houses a 400 square meter stage. To liven things up, there’s even an animated slide show, recounting the story of how Cao composed the song. In October 1943, Cao, a young member of the ‘Iron Blood’ propaganda troupe, was traveling through the village. The troupe had been staging performances in the countryside, to mobilize the masses to join in the revolution and fight against the invading Japanese. In responding to the Nationalists’ claim that “without the Nationalists, there would be no China,” Cao penned and composed the song at a temple in the village where he was staying...|$|R
40|$|Lofty Hindukush, Karakoram and Himalayan (HKH) {{mountain}} ranges {{centered in the}} Northern Pakistan are host {{to some of the}} world’s largest glaciers outside the Polar Regions and are a source of water for drinking and irrigation to the millions of people living downstream. With the increase in the global temperatures, glaciers are reported as retreating globally. However, some of the glaciers in the Karakoram {{mountain ranges}} are reported as surging with positive mass balance, especially since the 1990 s. This phenomenon is described as "The Karakoram Anomaly". Various efforts have been made to explain the state and fate of the HKH glaciers in the recent past. However, they are limited to quantification of the change in temperature, precipitation and river runoff, or through their impact on future climate projections. For the HKH region, temperature fluctuations have been out of the phase with hemispheric trends for past several centuries. Therefore, climate change in this region is not solely the temperature effect on melting as compared to other glaciated regions. To identify the reasons for the establishment of the Karakoram Anomaly, monthly mean climatic variables for last five decades, reported from meteorological observatories at the valley floors in HKH region, are analyzed. In addition to the climatic variables of temperature and precipitation, monthly mean synoptic observations reported by meteorological observatories in both morning and afternoon, along with monthly mean radiosonde data are used. From these data the role of different near-surface and upper atmospheric meteorological variables in maintaining the positive mass balance of the glaciers and the development of the Karakoram Anomaly can be explained. An overall warming in the region is observed. The trends in the summer temperatures, which were reported as decreasing a decade ago, are now found as increasing in updated time series. However, the overall gradient is still negative. The winter mean and maximum temperatures are increasing with accelerated trends. Both maximum and minimum temperatures in summer are not diverging anymore and the diurnal temperature range is decreasing in the most <b>recent</b> decade. The <b>afternoon</b> cloudiness is found as increasing throughout the year except for spring, which is indicative of an increase in convective uplifting. Moreover, humidity is increasing all over the region; due to evaporation in the spring, from monsoon moisture advection in summer, and due to the recycling of monsoon moisture in autumn. Furthermore, near-surface wind speed and net radiation in the region are decreasing, explaining the decrease in the summer minimum temperature and the presence of the cloudy skies. The decrease in near-surface wind speed, and net radiation, and increase in water vapor pressure put a limit on the evapotranspiration process. In addition, winter and summer precipitation is increasing. The aridity index, which is based on the ratio of precipitation and reference evaporation, indicates that region is turning moisture surplus and energy deficient. Surface atmospheric pressure and 700 hPa geopotential height is increasing due to warming in the bottom layers of the troposphere. Nighttime inversion in the lower tropospheric layers is decreasing due to warming. Analysis of gridded observed and reanalysis datasets indicates that they are not presenting a signal of change in accordance with the instrumental record. Furthermore, it is found that meteorological conditions during the summer season are still favorable for the sustenance of glaciers whereas more melting may occur in the spring season that may increase the early season river flows and may affect lower lying portions of the debris-free glaciers...|$|R
