40|$|The {{trend for}} a more {{sustainable}} style of living, the tightening legislation of waste treatment, depletion of natural resources, and the increasing amount of waste have created a good inducement for manufacturing wood-plastic composites from different recycled materials. The main aim of this thesis was to study how different <b>recycled</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> affect the properties and profitability of wood-plastic composites. Materials from construction and demolition industry and mining and packaging industry were used as fillers or as strengthening fibers. In another case, plastic materials from construction and demolition industry and from municipalities were used as the matrix. Some composites manufactured from different recycled materials were selected for comparing their costs to a composite manufactured from virgin materials. Mechanical and moisture resistance tests were carried out to evaluate {{the properties of the}} composites. The use of recycled material improved some properties and weakened some others. Construction and mining waste improved the moisture resistance, packaging waste improved the impact strength, and plastic waste decreased the price of the composite. There was no composite where all features were improved. The change of the properties was highly dependent on the materials used. The price of the composite decreased in all cases except one, when <b>recycled</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> were used, and even significantly when recycled plastic was used. The results of the study showed {{that it is possible to}} use <b>recycled</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> as a part of wood-plastic composites. The lower price and some improved properties encourage using recycled materials, when the features of the composite are understood. Due to the tightening legislation, there will be more material available for wood-plastic composites in the future.

Large amounts of scrap metal can be generated from the runner systems and feeders. In addition, chips are generated in the machined parts. The surface area with regard to weight of chips is so high that it makes these scraps difficult to melt. Although there are several techniques evolved to remedy this problem, yet the problem lies in the quality of the <b>recycled</b> <b>raw</b> <b>material.</b> Since recycling of these scrap is quite important due to the advantages like energy saving and cost reduction in the final product, in this work, the recycling efficiency and casting quality were investigated. Three types of charges were prepared for casting: % 100 primary ingot, % 100 scrap aluminium and fifty-fifty scrap aluminium and primary ingot mixture were used. Melt quality was determined by calculating bifilm index by using reduced pressure test. Tensile test samples were produced by casting both from sand and die moulds. Relationship between bifilm index and tensile strength were determined as an indication of correlation of melt quality. It was found that untreated chips decrease the casting quality significantly. Therefore, prior to charging the chips into the furnace for melting, a series of cleaning processes has to be used in order to achieve good quality products...|$|E

Recycling makes it possible to integrate <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> out of steadily increasing waste streams back into production processes. Considering stochastic prices for recycled materials, stochastic supply quantities from the recycler and stochastic demand as well as their potential dependencies, we develop a single-period inventory model to derive the order quantities for virgin and <b>recycled</b> <b>raw</b> <b>materials</b> to determine the related costs and {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the sourcing strategy.

Green sourcing is especially beneficial in terms of cost savings for high demand variability, high prices of virgin <b>raw</b> <b>material</b> and low expected recycling prices as well as for increasing standard deviation of the recycling price.

An alternative to a linear economy: extracting <b>raw</b> <b>materials,</b> producing, consuming, and discarding of a product, there is another option: Circular Economy (CE) : reusing products, repairing, recycling, and upcycling. A concept of a system/process (upAM) is developed to reuse unwanted or un-functional polymers issued from existing products/ systems. Waste prints can be re-printed into new products or systems with the same / higher quality or value than products created from <b>raw</b> <b>materials.</b> The upAM project is, therefore, concentrating on upcycling according to the definition given by author” Upcycling is a process in which used materials are converted into something of a higher value and/or quality in their second life”. This definition is simple and reflects fully the meaning of the upcycling process. This idea is not new; the concept of reused materials/products giving them a new life has been present for hundreds of years as a countermeasure against the lack of <b>raw</b> <b>materials.</b> At the moment, the situation in developed countries is evolving. Society is more aware that unlimited consumption leads to unlimited production of waste. Therefore, collective consciousness of a circular economy occurs, which supports greater resources of productivity aiming to reduce waste and avoid pollution by design, and purposeful reused waste materials and unwanted products.
