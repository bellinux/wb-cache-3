5000|$|From a {{historical}} standpoint {{the account of}} the battle above (contained within quotation marks) is fanciful at best, at worse nonsense. For any serious researcher of the period, the numbers should be the first piece of information to <b>ring</b> <b>alarm</b> bells (30,000 English troops? More than were present at Bannockburn?) as should the references to a made up Prior and Cistercian monastery. There is no contemporary evidence to support the narrative at all. Such a defeat for an English force (with thousands of casualties and prisoners) would have created a large paper trail within the extensive governmental records that survive for early 14th century England, as well as chronicles, diplomatic letters and other less formal sources.|$|E
50|$|In the 2004 reboot, {{written by}} Mark Waid, Timber Wolf {{appeared}} originally {{as an associate}} of the Legion but subsequently took on full Legion membership. Nothing has been revealed about his origin in this series, ended at issue #50 with several plotlines unresolved. Even if he hasn't shown his wolfen incarnation in this reboot, he's still prone in his human form to violent and vicious outburst of rage, especially when Princess Projectra, for whom he still carries a torch, is threatened. When Projectra, maddened {{by the loss of}} her home planet of Orando, begins to blame the whole Legion for her losses, Timber Wolf takes her side, going so far to cover up the savage beating of Phantom Girl at the hands of Princess Projectra, by sneaking around Princess Projectra and anonymously activating Phantom Girl's Legion <b>Ring</b> <b>alarm</b> only when he was sure of Projectra's own safety.|$|E

50|$|She {{has come}} to blame the Legion and the United Planets for the {{destruction}} of Orando, becoming increasingly colder and reclusive with the time passing. Upon meeting some Orando survivors, she plans her vengeance on the Legion, at first in a sneaky, covert way, then taking some vicious, proactive steps. These steps included having Nura Nal, at the time trapped in Brainiac 5's mind, blinded and stripped of her powers by the physical representations of Brainiac 5's inhibitions and urges (she would have been killed, if not for his superior mental discipline); viciously beating up Phantom Girl; and hypnotically mindwiping Saturn Girl to prevent her from speaking the truth about her findings upon her. Despite Timber Wolf discovering her treachery {{at the same time as}} Imra, and without being discovered, he deliberately hid the proof against her, activating Phantom Girl's Legion <b>Ring</b> <b>Alarm</b> only when he was sure Projectra was away, saving Tinya's life but granting his lover impunity.|$|E
5000|$|In early 2016, it was {{announced}} that Dame Moira Gibb would chair a review into how the allegations against Ball were handled and why there was so little credence given to his victims, also whether the Church of England complied with its statutory duties. The review had been criticised among other reasons because it will happen behind closed doors and lack what is considered necessary transparency and because it does not [...] "specifically include the questionable role played by the Church in bringing undue influence to bear on the administration of justice concerning Ball's abuse". I believe that the Church of England review should add bullying and silencing of victims and whistleblowers to the terms of reference and I shall be making this clear to Dame Moira before agreeing to take part. (Graham Sawyer, a vicar and abuse survivor speaking in Feb 2016) Sawyer stated in April 2016 that he is refusing to co-operate with the review because alleged bullying by high ranking current church office holders will not be investigated. Terry Sanderson of the National Secular Society said: The institutional bullying and silencing almost succeeded in preventing Bishop Ball ever being brought to justice. The Church's obdurate refusal at the highest levels to specify them and silencing in the Terms of Reference should <b>ring</b> <b>alarm</b> bells about the seriousness of its intentions to look at them with the requisite priority. Maintaining the refusal means the principal witness Graham Sawyer, and perhaps others, will not give evidence and this further undermines the validity of the Review. At least {{he will be able to}} give his evidence to the Independent (Goddard) Inquiry set up by the Government.|$|E
40|$|Recurrent large fiscal {{deficits and}} accumulating public debt {{frequently}} <b>ring</b> <b>alarm</b> bells {{around the world}} on the sustainability of U. S. federal fiscal policy. The present-value borrowing constraint, which states that, for the fiscal policy to be sustainable the current debt stock should match the discounted sum of expected future primary surpluses, provides a framework for analysing fiscal sustainability. Incorporating rational expectations we extend the methodology developed by Hamilton and Flavin (1986) to test the sustainability hypothesis in a cointegrating framework that can accommodate both stationary and non-stationary variables. Our model predicts dynamically diverse episodes of the debt series extremely well. Our results support the hypothesis that the U. S. government is solvent despite the large increase in the debt stock in recent years. Fiscal Policy Sustainability, Present-value Borrowing Constraint, Rational Expectations, Cointegration. ...|$|E

40|$|A menu of paired lottery choices is {{structured}} {{so that the}} crossover point to the high-risk lottery {{can be used to}} infer the degree of risk aversion. With "normal" laboratory payoffs of several dollars, most subjects are risk averse and few are risk loving. An increase in payoffs by a factor of twenty makes no significant difference when the high payoffs are hypothetical. In contrast, subjects become considerably more risk averse when the high payoffs are actually paid in cash. Keywords: lottery choice, risk aversion, incentive effects. Although risk aversion is a fundamental element in standard theories of lottery choice, asset valuation, contracts, and insurance (e. g. Daniel Bernoulli, 1738; John Pratt, 1964; Kenneth Arrow, 1965), experimental research has provided little guidance as to how risk aversion should be modeled.

40|$|What is {{the slope}} of the yield curve telling us? A yield curve is a graph of {{interest}} rates for bonds that have similar risk characteristics but differing maturities. Most of the time, the yield curve is upward sloping—rates on long-term bonds are higher than rates on short-term instruments. Sometimes, however, short-term interest rates are close to, or even higher than, long-term interest rates. In those cases, the yield curve is described as flat or inverted, respectively. A flat or inverted yield curve <b>rings</b> <b>alarm</b> bells because such a situation often precedes recessions. No one is completely certain why this occurs but there are several possibilities.
