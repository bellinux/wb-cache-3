40|$|Despite the {{relatively}} extensive research on pay levels {{and the consequences}} of income disparities, little is known about which reference groups people choose for comparative evaluation of personal income and why different selection patterns emerge. The aim {{of this paper is to}} dig deeper for answers to the following three questions: (1) What are the most important <b>reference</b> groups for <b>income</b> comparisons? (2) Who tends to use which type of reference group? (3) Which reference groupsare most detrimental to life satisfaction? The analysis is based on data from the 2008 and 2009 pretest modules of the Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP). The results show the working sphere (colleagues and members of the same profession) to be the most important point of <b>reference</b> for <b>income</b> comparisons, whereas neighbors are the least important. No clear-cut picture emerges for the differential selection of reference groups. Structural characteristics - e. g., level of income, education, and type of employment - are of only minor importance in the selection of <b>reference</b> groups for <b>income</b> comparisons. The results also suggest that individuals are likely to select those <b>reference</b> groups whose <b>income</b> is closest to their own. Therefore, the level of income relative to a reference group is related to the relevance of that group in income comparisons. The consequences of such comparisons for life satisfaction prove to be negative: the more importance an individual attaches to <b>income</b> comparisons with <b>reference</b> groups, the lower his or her life satisfaction. Income relative to neighbors and colleagues only affected life satisfaction when the respondent perceived such reference groups to be relevant in income comparisons. These results challenge previous research suggesting that people are unconscious of the true impact of comparison processes. Nevertheless, the results point to various difficulties in the measurement of social comparison processes andshow personal predispositions to be a major factor influencing such comparisons. The results strongly indicate the need for advanced instruments to measure the cognitive processes underlying social comparisons.

40|$|We first confirm {{previous}} {{results with}} the German Socio-Economic Panel by Layard et al. (2010), and obtain strong {{negative effects of}} comparison income. However, when we split the sample by age, we find quite different results for <b>reference</b> <b>income.</b> The effects on life- satisfaction are positive and significant for those under 45, consistent with Hirschman’s (1973) ‘tunnel effect’, and only negative (and larger than in the full sample) for those over 45, when relative deprivation dominates. Thus for young respondents, reference income’s signalling role, indicating potential future prospects, can outweigh relative deprivation effects. Own-income effects are also larger for the older sample, and of greater magnitude than the comparison income effect. In East Germany the <b>reference</b> <b>income</b> effects are insignificant for all.

However, {{in the existing}} empirical literature these phenomena are mainly studied in isolation from each other.

I focus on the short and long-run effects of income and social <b>reference</b> <b>income,</b> but I control for similar dynamics with respect to a large set of control variables.

First, we run a happiness regression that includes various indicators of social connections and confidence in institutions, alongside with own income, <b>reference</b> <b>income,</b> and the usual socio-demographic controls. We find that indicators of social connections and confidence in institutions are positively and significantly correlated with happiness. Second, we investigate the evolution of social connections and confidence in institutions over time, finding that they generally show a declining trend.

We find that own income has {{a positive effect on}} job satisfaction while the effect of <b>reference</b> group <b>income</b> is gender specific. We find evidence that males experience a tunnelling effect (higher income coworkers increase their job satisfaction) while females experience a jealousy effect (higher income co-workers lower their job satisfaction). We explain this result in terms of men reacting more strongly in competitive environments and that in China males have better prospects for promotion. We find that compared with employees in western countries, off farm migrants in China place much more emphasis on income and less importance on collegiality and job stability. When we regress job satisfaction on the factors which off farm migrants considered very important in their job, most {{have a negative effect on}} job satisfaction, which reflects lower levels of job satisfaction among off farm migrants than previous studies suggest is the case for urban residents in China or employees in western countries...|$|R
40|$|Theory {{suggests}} that subjective well-being {{is affected by}} income comparisons and adaptation to income. Empirical tests of the effects often rely on self-constructed measures from survey data. This paper shows that results can be highly sensitive to simple parameter changes. Using large-scale panel data from Germany and the UK, I report cases where plausible variations in the underlying income type substantially affect tests {{of the relationship between}} life satisfaction, income rank, <b>reference</b> <b>income,</b> and income adaptation. Models simultaneously controlling for income and income rank as well as models with a number of income lags are prone to imperfect multicollinearity with consequences for the precision and robustness of estimates. When testing relative-income effects, researchers should be aware that <b>reference</b> <b>income</b> constructed as average of a rather arbitrarily defined reference group and <b>reference</b> <b>income</b> predicted from Mincer-type earnings equations are two approaches that can produce inconsistent results, and that are probably not as reliable and valid as previously assumed.

Whereas in the old Europe, the income of my reference group exerts a negative effect on my individual welfare, it has a positive impact in the new Europe and the United States.

40|$|We {{examine the}} effects of <b>reference</b> <b>income</b> on the {{behavior}} of young male physicians. Using a unique panel of data, we relate physicians' reference and actual incomes to their subsequent income growth. <b>Reference</b> <b>income</b> has a strong positive effect on subsequent income for physicians who are below their reference points, but not for physicians who are at or above their reference points. Loss aversion, which posits a kink in utility at the reference point, explains this puzzling pattern. Physicians respond strongly to shortfalls from the reference point-they take unappealing actions to boost earnings-because the marginal utility of income is steep in that range.

30|$|D’Ambrosio and Frick (2012) used an {{alternative}} approach to distinguish the status (or positional) relative deprivation effect of comparison income from the signalling (or tunnel) effect by adding lagged income in a dynamic context. They found negative status effects of income-distance from richer individuals and the converse for income-distance from poorer people. They also interpreted a negative effect of comparison {{with people who are}} currently poorer but were richer in the previous period as a signal of possible loss of own future status. The importance of signalling thus also emerges in a very different context from our age-related, peer group comparison. Senik (2009) also considered dynamics and compared various <b>reference</b> <b>incomes</b> for transition countries, including past own income.
