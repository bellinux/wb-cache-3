2500|$|The bush {{ranged from}} [...] to {{the height of}} a horse; there were {{numerous}} Ber trees which have enormous thorns (the traditional [...] "crown of thorns" [...] tree) and big prickly bushes which made it quite easy to <b>rig</b> <b>up</b> shelter from the sun, and near Jericho a woody scrub [...] high, with broad leaves which are woolly on the underside, has fruit similar to apples. There was dense jhow jungle {{on either side of the}} Jordan River for some , and the banks were sheer about [...] above water-level which made it impossible to swim horses in the river.|$|E
2500|$|Since 1991, Metro Transit buses {{have been}} allowed to use “bus-only {{shoulders}},” road shoulders to bypass traffic jams. Currently, buses are allowed to travel no more than [...] or [...] faster than the congested traffic in the general purpose lanes. Bus drivers must be very attentive when taking the bus onto the shoulder, since that part of the road is only about one foot wider than the buses in many cases. To help with this issue, researchers at the University of Minnesota helped <b>rig</b> <b>up</b> a bus with a lane-keep system, along with a heads-up display connected to a radar system to alert the driver of any obstacles. The technology was an adaptation of a system previously tested with drivers of snowplows and made some headlines in the early 2000s. This system will be more widely deployed under the Urban Partnership Agreement that assisted in the Marq2 project.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's snowin' {{like all}} git out," [...] he said, [...] "and I've got to <b>rig</b> <b>up</b> {{some kind of}} a sled. I reckon winter has come in earnest now, and our coal-pile is low." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] replied Peterkin.--"Here, Ralph, lay hold o' {{this pair}} of oars, and stow them away if you can. I don't like paddles. After we're safe away, I'll try to <b>rig</b> <b>up</b> {{rowlocks}} for them." ...|$|E
