40|$|Camera {{spectral}} sensitivity {{plays an important}} role for various color-based computer vision tasks. Although several methods have been proposed to estimate it, their applicability is severely restricted by the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> a known <b>illumination</b> spectrum. In this work, we present a single-image estimation method using fluorescence with no <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> a known <b>illumination</b> spectrum. Under d-ifferent illuminations, the spectral distributions of fluorescence emitted from the same material remain unchanged up to a certain scale. Thus, a camera’s response to the fluorescence would have the same chromaticity. Making use of this chromaticity invariance, the camera {{spectral sensitivity}} can be estimated under an arbitrary illumination whose spectrum is unknown. Through extensive experiments, we proved that our method is accurate under different illuminations. Moreover, we show how to recover the spectra of daylight from the estimated results. Finally, we use the estimated camera spectral sensitivities and daylight spectra to solve color correction problems. 1...|$|R
50|$|A {{limitation}} of FRET is the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> external <b>illumination</b> {{to initiate the}} fluorescence transfer, {{which can lead to}} background noise in the results from direct excitation of the acceptor or to photobleaching. To avoid this drawback, Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (or BRET) has been developed. This technique uses a bioluminescent luciferase (typically the luciferase from Renilla reniformis) rather than CFP to produce an initial photon emission compatible with YFP. One drawback of BRET is the requirement to generate at least one fusion protein encoding luciferase, though some applications of FRET can be implemented with antibody-conjugated fluorophores.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{fluorescent}} proteins has revolutionized {{our understanding}} of biological processes. However, the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> external <b>illumination</b> precludes their universal application {{to the study of}} biological processes in all tissues. Although light can be created by chemilumines-cence, light emission from existing chemiluminescent probes is too weak to use this imaging modality in situations when fluorescence cannot be used. Here we report the development of the brightest luminescent protein to date, Nano-lantern, which is a chimera of enhanced Renilla luciferase and Venus, a fluorescent protein with high bioluminescence resonance energy transfer efficiency. Nano-lantern allows real-time imaging of intracellular structures in living cells with spatial resolution equivalent to fluorescence and sensitive tumour detection in freely moving unshaved mice. We also create functional indicators based on Nano-lantern that can image Ca 2 þ, cyclic adenosine monophosphate and adenosine 50 -triphosphate dynamics in environments where the use of fluorescent indicators is not feasible. These luminescent proteins allow visualization of biological phenomena at previously unsee...|$|R
40|$|The ocean depths {{provide an}} ever {{changing}} and complex imaging environment. As scientists and researches strive to document and study more remote and optically challenging areas, specifically scatter-limited environments. There is a <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> new <b>illumination</b> systems that improve both image quality and increase imaging distance. One {{of the most}} constraining optical properties to underwater image quality are scattering caused by ocean chemistry and entrained organic material. By reducing {{the size of the}} scatter interaction volume, one can immediately improve both the focus (forward scatter limited) and contrast (backscatter limited) of underwater images. This thesis describes a relatively simple, cost-effective and field-deployable low-power dynamic lighting system that minimizes the scatter interaction volume with both subjective and quantifiable improvements in imaging performance. by Geoffrey Allen Gorman.

40|$|Appearance {{of objects}} in {{captured}} images and videos not only relies on objects themselves, but also significantly depends on imaging sensors and illuminations. Therefore, investigating how light emitted from light source interacts with objects and sensors {{has been an important}} task for a variety of applications in computer vision field. It is well known that light spans in a wide wavelength range, thus this interaction should be analyzed in spectral domain. However, it is hard to carry out the analysis because dominating equipments usually provide RGB 3 values only which are far from enough for spectral information estimation in the visible wavelength range. To deal with this problem, we present a framework for estimating spectral information of objects, cameras and illumination in this thesis. First, we show a system to recover spectral reflectance of objects with high temporal resolution. Spectral reflectance offers intrinsic characteristics of objects that are independent of illuminations and sensors. This direct representation about the objects is useful for solving many computer vision problems. However, existing methods for spectral reflectance recovery are limited either by their low temporal resolution or <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> special hardware. To remove these limitations, we present a novel system for spectral reflectance recovery by exploiting the unique color-forming mechanism of Digital Light Processing (DLP) projectors. DLP projectors use color wheels which are composed of several color segments and rotate quickly to produce desired light. We make effective use of this mechanism and show that a DLP projector {{can be used as a}} light source with spectrally distinct illuminations when we capture scenes'appearance under the projector's irradiation by a high-speed camera. Our imaging system is built on easily available devices and capable of conducting spectral measurements at 100 Hz. Based on the measurements obtained by our system, spectral reflectance of the scene is recovered using a linear approximation of surface reflectance. We carefully evaluate the accuracy of our system and demonstrate its effectiveness by spectral relighting of dynamic scenes with fast-moving objects. Then, we use fluorescence to estimate camera spectral sensitivity under unknown illuminations. Camera spectral sensitivity is an indispensable factor for various color-based computer vision tasks. Though several methods have been proposed to estimate it, their applications are all severely restricted by the <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> a known <b>illumination</b> spectrum. In this thesis, we present a single-image estimation method using fluorescence with no <b>requirement</b> <b>for</b> a known <b>illumination</b> spectrum. Under different illuminations, the spectral distributions of fluorescence emitted from the same material remain unchanged up to a certain scale. Thus, a camera's response to the fluorescence would have the same chromaticity. Making use of this chromaticity invariance, the camera spectral sensitivity can be estimated under an arbitrary illumination whose spectrum is unknown. Through extensive experiments, we proved that our method is accurate under different illuminations. Finally, based on the estimated camera spectral sensitivity, we show how to recover spectra of daylights with high accuracy. Making use the estimated camera spectral sensitivities and daylight spectra, color correction problems can be solved. Results show that images after the correction match the target images well. 報告番号: 甲 28466; 学位授与年月日: 2012 - 03 - 22; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(情報理工学); 学位記番号:; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|R
