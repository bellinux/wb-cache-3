25|$|Housing {{inequality}} is {{the difference}} in the quality of housing that exists within a given society. It is a form of economic inequality. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> is a recognized right by many national constitutions and the lack of adequate housing can have adverse consequences for the options available to an individual or family. The term may apply regionally across a geographic space, temporally between one generation and the next, or culturally between groups of different racial or social backgrounds. Housing inequality is directly related to concepts of racial inequality, social inequality, income inequality, and wealth inequality. It is often the result of factors including natural market forces, housing discrimination, and housing segregation.|$|E
25|$|In federal legislation, the key planks for {{the right}} to a useful and remunerative job {{included}} the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. After the war was the Employment Act of 1946, which created an objective for the government to eliminate unemployment, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited unjustified discrimination in the workplace and in access to public and private services. They remained some of the key elements of US labor law. The rights to food and fair agricultural wages was assured by numerous Acts on agriculture in the United States and by the Food Stamp Act of 1964. The right to freedom from unfair competition was primarily seen to be achievable through the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice's enforcement of both the Sherman Act of 1890 and the Clayton Act of 1914, with some minor later amendments. The most significant program of change occurred through Lyndon Johnson's Great Society. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> was developed through a policy of subsidies and government building under the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965. The right to health care was partly improved by the Social Security Act of 1965 and, more recently, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010. The Social Security Act of 1935 had laid the groundwork for protection from fear of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment. The right to a decent education was shaped heavily by Supreme Court jurisprudence, and the administration of education was left to the states, particularly with Brown v. Board of Education. A legislative framework developed through the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and in higher education, a measure of improvement began with federal assistance and regulation in the Higher Education Act of 1965.|$|E
500|$|The {{right to}} {{adequate}} housing, {{also referred to}} as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing,</b> is [...] "the right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity". It requires [...] "adequate privacy, adequate space, adequate security, adequate lighting and ventilation, adequate basic infrastructure and adequate location with regard to work and basic facilities – all at a reasonable cost". Parties must ensure security of tenure and that access is free of discrimination, and progressively work to eliminate homelessness. Forced evictions, defined as [...] "the permanent or temporary removal against their will of individuals, families and/or communities from the homes and/or land which they occupy, without the provision of, and access to, appropriate forms of legal or other protection", are a prima facie violation of the Covenant.|$|E
40|$|The human <b>right</b> <b>to</b> {{adequate}} <b>housing</b> is {{enshrined in}} international law. The <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>housing</b> {{can be traced}} to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was unanimously adopted by the world community in 1948. Since that time, the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> adequate <b>housing</b> has been reaffirmed on numerous occasions and further defined and elaborated...|$|R

She said she would simplify procedures for evicting people who were deliberately not paying their rent; and would facilitate the purchase of council housing by people who have rented it for 15 years.|$|E
2500|$|Although the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> (Article 11 of the ICESCR) is not {{incorporated}} in any domestic law and is hence not an [...] "entitlement", the Hong Kong Government has been providing public {{housing in the}} nature of [...] "grace". In 1973, the government announced a 10-year plan to provide self-contained public housing to 1.8 million people. In 1995, public housing accommodated 2 million people, accounting for 45% of all housing. Public housing rental units are provided at subsidised rates (typically 20% of that in the private market), although their allocation is mean tested. The government introduced the Home Ownership Scheme in 1978 and the Sandwich Class Housing Scheme in the 1990s to allow families to own their own homes.|$|E
2500|$|Local {{authorities}} {{have a duty}} to act in a way to facilitate the right to family life, for example in providing travel arrangements for the elderly under the Health Services and Public Health Act 1968. The right to education is guaranteed by the Education Act 1944, and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> is enshrined in the Housing Act 1985. The enactment of the National Minimum Wage Act 1998 installed a minimum wage and the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992 provides access to social security benefits. There is no positive right to healthcare; the National Health Service Act 1977 imposes a duty on the Secretary of State to provide [...] "adequate" [...] healthcare but the courts have not thus far been willing to enforce this duty.|$|E

2500|$|The Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Directive 1993 was {{the second}} main measure. Under article 3(1) a term is unfair, and not binding, {{if it is not}} [...] "individually negotiated| and [...] "if, {{contrary}} to the requirement of good faith, it causes a significant imbalance in the parties' rights and obligations arising under the contract, {{to the detriment of the}} consumer". The Court of Justice has continually affirmed that the Directive, as recital 16 states, [...] "is based on the idea that the consumer is in a weak position vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge". Terms which are very skewed, are to be conclusively regarded as contrary to [...] "good faith" [...] and therefore unfair. For example, in RWE AG v Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV clauses in gas supply contracts enabling corporation, RWE, to unilaterally vary prices were advised by the Court of Justice to be not sufficiently transparent, and therefore unfair. In Brusse v Jahani BV the Court of Justice advised that clauses in a tenancy contract requiring tenants pay €25 per day were likely unfair, and would have to be entirely void without replacement, if they were not substituted with more precise mandatory terms in national legislation. In Aziz v Caixa d'Estalvis de Catalunya, following the global financial crisis, the Court of Justice advised that even terms regarding repossession of homes in Spain had to be assessed for fairness by national courts. In Kušionová v SMART Capital a.s., the Court of Justice held that consumer law was to be interpreted in the light of fundamental rights, including the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing,</b> in the event that a home could be repossessed. Because consumer law operates through Directives, national courts have the final say on applying the general principles set out by the Court of Justice's case law.|$|E

Of course, most (States) have ratified <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>housing</b> at an international level in a range of instruments, from the United Nations (UN) to the Council of Europe. Implementation of these rights is obliged and promoted within both a programmatic approach, as well as a violations and remedies approach (opportunities for litigation in the event of breaches). Each ratifying State regularly produces monitoring reports for the relevant international treaty body on how these rights are being given effect, legally, at policy level, and programmatically.
