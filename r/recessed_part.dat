60|$|When I {{left him}} there {{to go back}} to my room the steward was {{finishing}} dusting. I sent for the mate and engaged him in some insignificant conversation. It was, as it were, trifling with the terrific character of his whiskers; but my object was to give him an opportunity for a good look at my cabin. And then I could at last shut, with a clear conscience, the door of my stateroom and get my double back into the <b>recessed</b> <b>part.</b> There was nothing else for it. He had to sit still on a small folding stool, half smothered by the heavy coats hanging there. We listened to the steward going into the bath-room out of the saloon, filling the water-bottles there, scrubbing the bath, setting things to rights, whisk, bang, clatter--out again into the saloon--turn the key-- click. Such was my scheme for keeping my second self invisible. Nothing better could be contrived under the circumstances. And there we sat; I at my writing-desk ready to appear busy with some papers, he behind me, out of sight of the door. It would not have been prudent to talk in daytime; and I could not have stood the excitement of that queer sense of whispering to myself. Now and then glancing over my shoulder, I saw him far back there, sitting rigidly on the low stool, his bare feet close together, his arms folded, his head hanging on his breast--and perfectly still. Anybody would have taken him for me.|$|E
60|$|XXVII. The very awkwardness {{with which}} such occurrences of {{difficulty}} are {{met by the}} earlier builder, marks his dislike of the system, and unwillingness to attract the eye to such arrangements. There is another very clumsy one, in the junction of the upper and sub-arches of the triforium of Salisbury; but it is kept in the shade, and all the prominent junctions are of mouldings like each other, and managed with perfect simplicity. But so soon as {{the attention of the}} builders became, as we have just seen, fixed upon the lines of mouldings instead of the enclosed spaces, those lines began to preserve an independent existence wherever they met; and different mouldings were studiously associated, in order to obtain variety of intersectional line. We must, however, do the late builders the justice to note that, in one case, the habit grew out of a feeling of proportion, more refined than that of earlier workmen. It shows itself first in the bases of divided pillars, or arch mouldings, whose smaller shafts had originally bases formed by the continued base of the central, or other larger, columns with which they were grouped; but it being felt, when the eye of the architect became fastidious, that the dimension of moulding which was right for the base of a large shaft, was wrong for that of a small one, each shaft had an independent base; at first, those of the smaller died simply down on that of the larger; but when the vertical sections of both became complicated, the bases of the smaller shafts were considered to exist within those of the larger, and the places of their emergence, on this supposition, were calculated with the utmost nicety, and cut with singular precision; so that an elaborate late base of a divided column, as, for instance, of those in the nave of Abbeville, looks exactly as if its smaller shafts had all been finished to the ground first, each with its complete and intricate base, and then the comprehending base of the central pier had been moulded over them in clay, leaving their points and angles sticking out here and there, like the edges of sharp crystals out of a nodule of earth. The exhibition of technical dexterity in work of this kind is often marvellous, the strangest possible shapes of sections being calculated to a hair's-breadth, and the occurrence of the under and emergent forms being rendered, even in places where they are so slight that they can hardly be detected but by the touch. It is impossible to render a very elaborate example of this kind intelligible, without some fifty measured sections; but fig. 6, Plate IV. is a very interesting and simple one, from the west gate of Rouen. It is part of the base of one of the narrow piers between its principal niches. The square column k, having a base with the profile p r, is supposed to contain within itself another similar one, set diagonally, and lifted so far above the inclosing one, as that the <b>recessed</b> <b>part</b> of its profile [=p] r shall fall behind the projecting part of the outer one. The angle of its upper portion exactly meets the plane of the side of the upper inclosing shaft 4, and would, therefore, not be seen, unless two vertical cuts were made to exhibit it, which form two dark lines the whole way up the shaft. Two small pilasters are run, like fastening stitches, through the junction {{on the front of the}} shafts. The sections [=k] [=n] taken respectively at the levels k, n, will explain the hypothetical construction of the whole. Fig. 7 is a base, or joint rather (for passages of this form occur again and again, on the shafts of flamboyant work), of one of the smallest piers of the pedestals which support the lost statues of the porch; its section below would be the same as [=n], and its construction, after what has been said of the other base, will be at once perceived.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: 15 N { 31 P} REDOR NMR {{experiments}} {{were applied to}} lyophilized binary complexes of 3 -deoxy-D-manno- 2 -octulosonate- 8 -phosphate synthase (KDO 8 PS), with each of its natural substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and arabinose- 5 -phsophate (A 5 P), and with a mechanism-based inhibitor (Ki) 0. 4 µM), directly characterizing the active site basic residues involved in the binding of their carboxylate and phosphate moieties. KDO 8 PS was labeled uniformly with 15 Nor[η- 15 N 2]Arg, and the ligands were selectively labeled with 13 C and 15 N. The NMR data established that PEP is bound by KDO 8 PS via a preserved set of structurally rigid and chemically unique Arg and Lys residues, with 5 Å (upper limit) between ɛ- 15 N of this Lys and 31 P of PEP. A 5 P is bound in its cyclic forms to KDO 8 PS via {{a different set of}} Lys and Arg residues. The two sets arise from adjacent subsites that are capable of independent and sufficiently strong binding. The inhibitor is best characterized as an A 5 P-based substrate analogue inhibitor of KDO 8 PS. Five mutants in which highly conserved arginines were replaced with alanines were prepared and kinetically characterized. Our solid-state NMR observations complement the crystallographic structure of KDO 8 PS, and in combination with the mutagenesis results enable tentative assignment of the NMRidentified active site residues.

A brief description of the methodology of the study and the research context conclude Part I. Part II reviews several theories and definitions of play with a focus on the most recent theories governing current understanding of children's play. In this section, several types of research studies are reviewed including research regarding the most appropriate context for play, studies that focus on children's behaviors, and studies that focus on parental views of play. Part II concludes with a summary of research based effects of play in several domains: physical, cognitive, psychological, and social. The methods, context, and results of the current study are described fully in Part III. Fifty-seven Delaware County teachers and eight administrators were surveyed regarding the time allocated for recess, the advantages and disadvantages of play, and the effects of recess on children's behavior. An analysis of the results examines results in terms of differences between teachers and administrators, variations between grade levels, and variations between schools.

40|$|The site of Toca da Janela da Barra do Antonião (TJBA) is {{situated}} in the calcareous massif of Antero, in the Serra da Capivara National Park, Piauí State, Brazil. The entire rockshelter is more than 150 m long, with few meters deep <b>recesses.</b> <b>Part</b> of the site was extensively studied in the 1990 s [1]. Our team begun a wide archaeological program in the region in 2008 [2, 3], focusing on different archaeological sequences. New archaeological excavations started in TJBA in 2013, at an extremity of the Toca, without possible stratigraphic correlation with previous excavations. After 3 archaeological campaigns, the bedrock was not reached. At the time of writing this abstract (April 2016), the site presents a 1. 5 m thick chrono-cultural sequence, inside of which six sedimentary layers and four archaeological levels were identified. All the four archaeological layers delivered lithic and faunal remains. The two archaeological layers {{at the top of}} the sequence are separated by a thin sterile sediment layer, but present a cultural homogeneity, and both can be attributed to the Itaparica facies of the region. The two underlying archaeological levels are poorer in lithic artefacts; the lithics can be divided in three categories: small artefacts on quartz, big artefacts on quartz, and hammers. These two lower levels also delivered skeletal remains of a giant sloth corresponding to Eremotherium (megafauna); in particular, it seems that certain bones were used to produce artefacts. Charcoal samples from the upper part of the sequence were radiocarbon dated. In addition, six sediment samples were collected from the profile for luminescence dating. Sand-sized (180 - 250 μm) and fine (20 - 41 μm) quartz grains were extracted from the samples and prepared following a standard chemical treatment. For all six samples, the quartz OSL signal is bright, reproducible and dominated by the fast component, which indicates good luminescence characteristics for obtaining accurate and precise ages. OSL measurements were performed on both multi-grain and single-grain aliquots. The ages obtained for the two upper archaeological levels (Itaparica) correspond to the beginning of the Holocene. Conversely, the other two archaeological levels are dated to the end of the Pleistocene. Thus, the Toca da Janela da Barra do Antonião constitutes the fifth Pleistocene-Holocene chrono-cultural sequence studied by our team in the region [2, 3, 4]. As such, it provides new evidence of an ancient human presence in South America, more than 20, 000 years ago. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Scuba diving, an {{expensive}} form of extreme sport, remains popular despite {{the world wide}} economic <b>recess.</b> <b>Part</b> of its popularity is ascribed {{to the fact that}} it allows for sensation seekers to experience novel experiences. Research has indicated that novel experiences induce stress responses in human beings. Amongst scuba divers, this stress response was often measured with psychometric instruments after dives had occurred. The problem, however, is that to understand the stress response one must not only study the psychological dimension, but also needs to investigate its physiological impact on the body. In the scuba diving environment though, it not preferable to measure it after a scuba dive had occurred. Researchers have discovered that anticipating being confronted with a novel experience could elicit a physiological stress response. Because of this, it is theorized that scuba divers would experience a stress response by merely anticipating being underwater. The aim of the present study was to determine if a physiological stress response occurred in a group of beginner divers. Since these divers are also confronted with a series of novel experiences during their training, another aim of the study was to investigate how the stress response manifested physiologically as the course progressed. Sixty divers participated in the study. Heart rate measurements and salivary specimen were taken on three occasions: at rest (baseline), before entering the pool to practice scuba skills and before participating in the first open water dive. Cortisol was extracted from the salivary specimen. The results indicated that significant differences occurred in cortisol levels between the baseline and before entering the pool measurements. Significant differences were also observed between the baseline and before the open water dive measurements. Heart rate yielded significant differences between the baseline and before the pool measurements, as well as between the pool and before the open water dive measures. The findings indicated that beginner divers experienced a physiological stress response as a result of anticipating taking part in a novel experience. It further suggested that, as their training progressed, the stress response did not disappear but was controlled or inhibited after the first encounter with the underwater environment. The reason for this is that different systems in the sympathetic nervous system are responsible for the activation of cortisol and heart rate. [URL]...|$|R

In front of this place lay a pile of earth, which had evidently been taken from the <b>recess,</b> and <b>part</b> of which was yet fresh. An examination of the exterior of the cavern left the Judge in doubt whether it was one of Nature’s frolics that had thrown it into that shape, or whether it had been wrought by the hands of man, at some earlier period. But there could be no doubt that the whole of the interior was of recent formation, and the marks of the pick were still visible where the soft, lead-colored rock had opposed itself to the progress of the miners. The whole formed an excavation of about twenty feet in width, and nearly twice that distance in depth. The height was much greater than was required for the ordinary purposes of experiment, but this was evidently the effect of chance, as the roof of the cavern was a natural stratum of rock that projected many feet beyond the base of the pile. Immediately in front of the recess, or cave, was a little terrace, partly formed by nature, and partly by the earth that had been carelessly thrown aside by the laborers. The mountain fell off precipitously in front of the terrace, and the approach by its sides, under the ridge of the rocks, was difficult and a little dangerous. The whole was wild, rude, and apparently incomplete; for, while looking among the bushes, the sheriff found the very implements that had been used in the work.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the arthroscopically accessible {{anatomy of the}} tarsal collateral ligaments in the horse. STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. ANIMALS: Cadaveric equine hind limbs (n = 24) obtained from horses without tarsal disease. METHODS: Two pairs of tarsal joints were used to obtain silicone models of the tarsocrural joint and dissect the tarsal collateral ligaments (CLs). Ten pairs of tarsocrural joints had arthroscopic exploration and the accessible parts of the tarsal CLs were marked with an arthroscopic hook knife. Subsequently, the limbs were dissected and the marked positions were allocated to the specific parts of the CLs. RESULTS: Ipsilateral arthroscope and instrument portals were used in each pouch of the tarsocrural joint. Via the plantaromedial pouch, the superficial (2 / 20 limbs), middle (7), deep (6) or both middle and deep (3) short medial CL and the long medial CL (14) were reached. Access via the plantarolateral pouch allowed manipulation of the deep short lateral CL (20 / 20 limbs) and the long lateral CL (20). Dorsally, arthroscopy via the dorsomedial pouch gave access to the deep short medial CL (20 / 20 limbs), while the superficial (9) or middle (10) or both superficial and middle (1) short lateral CL could be reached via the dorsolateral joint <b>recess.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Limited <b>parts</b> of the tarsal CLs can be observed or manipulated arthroscopically in normal equine tarsocrural joints...|$|R
40|$|In Squeeze Film Dampers, (SFD), grooves (deep or shallow) {{are used}} to feed oil into the damper and prevent oil {{starvation}} within the fluid film lands. In oil seals with film land of clearance c, short shallow grooves (depth ? 15 c, length ? 30 c) are machined to reduce the cross-coupled stiffness coefficients, and thus improve the seal stability characteristics. Moreover, test stands for these devices can also incorporate grooves or <b>recesses</b> as <b>part</b> of oil feeding/ discharge arrangements. A common assumption is that these grooves do not influence the test system forced response. However, unexpected large added mass coefficients are reported in these configurations and not adequately predicted. In the case of grooved oil seals, experimental results also show that circumferential grooves do aid to reduce cross-coupled force coefficients but {{to a lesser extent}} than predictions otherwise indicate. A linear fluid inertia model for analysis of multiple-groove SFD or oil seal configurations is advanced. A perturbation analysis for small motion about a journal centered and off-centered position yields zeroth and first order flow equations defined at each individual flow region (land and grooves) of constant clearance (c). The analysis considers both the circumferential and axial dynamic pressure variations across the groove and land regions. At the groove regions, an effective groove depth (d?) and effective clearance (c d c ? ? = +) are defined based on qualitative observations of the laminar flow pattern through annular cavities. This depth differs from the actual physical groove depth. The boundary conditions at the inlet and exit plane are a function of the geometric configuration. Integration of the resulting dynamic pressure fields on the journal surface yields the force coefficients (stiffness, damping, and inertia). Comparisons between predicted and experimental force coefficients for a grooved oil seal and a SFD show excellent correlation over a narrow range of effective groove depths. The results confirm that large added mass coefficients are associated to the feed/discharge grooves in the scrutinized test configurations. Furthermore, predictions, benchmarking experimental data, corroborate that short inner land grooves in an oil seal do not isolate the pressure field of the adjacent film lands, and hence contribute greatly to the force response of the seal...|$|R
50|$|The asymmetrically {{composed}} western {{facade of}} the building, addressing Ann Street, comprises the gabled ends of the western transept and, at the northern end, an entrance porch abutting the smaller gabled end of the Session House. Between the entrance porch and transept is a <b>recessed</b> wall, forming <b>part</b> of {{the wall of the}} nave of the church, which is externally buttressed with two tapered brick projections, extending to the sub floor level. The buttresses extend out from the building to be aligned with the transept face and have semicircular arched openings at their bases, forming a cloister-like external court adjacent to the hall {{in the basement of the}} church. The gabled transept end has three semicircular arched window openings, elongated and extending over much of the length of the gabled end. The entrance porch is square planned projection, with a simple roof and housing a semicircular arched doorway providing access to an internal porch leading to the narthex of the church. Above the doorway are several concrete bands one of which is pebble dashed, above these are three small circular windows in a horizontal line with concrete surrounds. The gabled end of the session house is visually dominated by a projecting bay window or oriel, at first floor level. Below this at ground floor level is a semicircular arched doorway providing entrance to the session house and a tripartite window arrangement of small equally sized rectangular openings, glazed with stained and coloured glass.|$|R
