50|$|Plectranthus, {{with some}} 350 species, is a genus of warm-climate plants {{occurring}} {{largely in the}} southern hemisphere, in sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, India and the Indonesian archipelago down to Australia and some Pacific Islands. They {{are closely related to}} Solenostemon and are known as the spurflowers. Several species are grown as ornamental plants, as leaf <b>vegetables,</b> as <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> their edible tubers, or as medicine.|$|R
50|$|Other {{species are}} grown for food, {{including}} the Indian pea (L. sativus) {{and the red}} pea (L. cicera), and less commonly Cyprus-vetch (L. ochrus) and Spanish vetchling (L. clymenum). The tuberous pea (L. tuberosus) is grown as a <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> its starchy edible tuber. The seeds of some Lathyrus species contain the toxic amino acid oxalyldiaminopropionic acid and if eaten in large quantities can cause lathyrism, a serious disease.|$|R

50|$|Traditionally, <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> held a {{very high}} status in First Nations food systems. <b>Root</b> <b>vegetables</b> were {{important}} <b>for</b> food, ceremonial and economic reasons. Some nations held a First Roots ceremony to show respect for the roots before the community went digging for their needs. Roots were dried in large quantities, traded {{from one place to}} another and were kept as a “back-up” in times of food shortage. For example, during the summer months, St'at'imc, Nlaka'pamux and Secwepemc women would dig the corms of Yellow Glacier Lily (Erythronium grandiflorum). Families would gather upwards of 2000 lbs. The corms were cleaned then steamed or pit-cooked. Large quantities of yellow glacier lily roots would be dried for later use or for trade. In addition, Camas used to be an important staple across Southern BC. Access to and the use of camas by Interior communities was made possible through trade form the peoples of what is now northern Washington. Large camas beds on southern Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands were kept free of invading plants through regular clearing and burning. Traditionally, for the Kwakwaka’wakw village of Haada, trade in <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> (springbank clover (Trifolium wormskioldii), silverweed and northern riceroot (Fritillaria camschatcensis) with the Nuxalk and Heiltsuk was an important part of their regional economy.|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, France, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Syngenta Crop Protection to modify the existing MRLs for isopyrazam in various <b>root</b> and tuber <b>vegetables,</b> peppers and cucurbits (edible and inedible peel). In order to accommodate for the intended uses of isopyrazam in Europe, the EMS proposed to raise the existing MRLs for isopyrazam in all crops under consideration. France drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. According to EFSA, the data are sufficient to derive a MRL proposal for carrots, which can be extrapolated to other <b>root</b> and tuber <b>vegetables,</b> <b>for</b> peppers (indoor GAP), for cucumbers (indoor GAP), which is extrapolated to gherkins and courgettes and for melons (indoor GAP), which can be applied also for pumpkins and watermelons. Based on the risk assessment results, EFSA concludes that the intended uses of isopyrazam on the crops under consideration will not result in a consumer exposure exceeding the toxicological reference values and therefore are unlikely to pose a public health concern...|$|R
40|$|In {{accordance}} with Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, the United Kingdom, hereafter {{referred to as}} the evaluating Member State (EMS), received an application from Bayer CropScience Ltd to modify the existing MRL for the active substance pencycuron in potatoes. In order to accommodate for the intended use of pencycuron the United Kingdom proposed to raise the existing MRL in potatoes from 0. 1 mg/kg to 0. 2 mg/kg. The United Kingdom drafted an evaluation report in {{accordance with}} Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 396 / 2005, which was submitted to the European Commission and forwarded to EFSA. EFSA is of the opinion that the metabolic pathway of pencycuron in <b>root</b> and tuber <b>vegetables</b> <b>for</b> the proposed use pattern of pencycuron is not adequately elucidated, hence the available information is not adequate to derive a MRL proposal for the intended use of pencycuron on potatoes sprayed in-furrow at planting and to perform a reliable consumer risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|Chlordecone, an {{organochlorine}} insecticide, {{continues to}} pollute soils in the French West Indies. The {{main source of}} human exposure to this pollutant is food. <b>Root</b> <b>vegetables,</b> which are staple foods in tropical regions, can be highly contaminated and are thus a very effective lever for action to reduce consumer exposure. We analyzed chlordecone contamination in three <b>root</b> <b>vegetables,</b> yam, dasheen and sweet potato, which are among the main sources of chlordecone exposure in food in the French West Indies. All soil types {{do not have the}} same potential for the contamination of <b>root</b> <b>vegetables,</b> allophanic andosols being two to ten times less contaminating than non-allophanic nitisols and ferralsols. This difference was only partially explained by the higher OC content in allophanic soils. Dasheen corms were shown to accumulate more chlordecone than yam and sweet potato tubers. The physiological nature of the <b>root</b> <b>vegetable</b> may explain this difference. Our results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that chlordecone uptake by <b>root</b> <b>vegetables</b> is based on passive and diffusive processes and limited by transport and dilution during growth.

40|$|Chicory is an {{important}} medicinal plant and also used as a leaf <b>vegetable</b> <b>for</b> pasture <b>forage.</b> In order to study the effect of nitrogen and pant density on this plant, an experiment was conducted in the 2009 - 2010 growing season at the Agricultural Training Center of Mohammadieh, Birjand, Iran. A split plot experiment based on a randomized complete block design with three replications was used. Nitrogen rates including of 0, 100 and 200 kg. ha- 1 N as urea (N 0, N 100 and N 200, respectively) were arranged in main plots and four planting density (25, 16. 7, 12. 5 and 10 plants. m- 2) were employed in the subplots. The results indicated that nitrogen application had not any significant effect on dry root yield, but application of 200 kg. ha- 1 N compared to control, increased dry leaf and total yields 39. 85 and 31. 89 percent, respectively. Although nitrogen application significantly decreased NUE but increasing plant density increased it. Increasing plant density enhanced root and leaf dry yield, but declined plant height, axillary root number and root length. Nitrogen application had not any significant effect on axillary root number and root diameter and length. The effect of nitrogen and plant density on root/shoot ratio was not significant. Totally {{the result showed that}} chicory's yield respond positively to increasing plant density (25 plant. m- 2) and nitrogen rate (200 kg. ha- 1) but increasing the yield was not proportionally to nitroge...|$|R
