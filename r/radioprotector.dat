40|$|The <b>radioprotector</b> are {{agents that}} reduce the toxicity, {{mutagenicity}} and other adverse biological {{effects of the}} ionizing radiations in the living beings. The aminotioles was {{the first group of}} identified compounds as potential radioprotectors. The paper of the <b>radioprotector</b> compounds is very important in the clinical radiotherapy; therefore, the search of new type compounds and the study of their action mechanisms constitute a road to develop more effective methodologies. The objective of our work is to give a current version of the classification and main types of <b>radioprotector</b> substances and their action mechanisms. These substances are classified in three types: the radioprotectors like such, the adaptogens and the absorbent agents. Inside the main types of <b>radioprotector</b> substances existent they are the Sulfhidril-groups compounds, amino acids, polyamines and other compounds, antioxidant and free radicals kidnappers and lastly the phytochemical compounds...|$|E

For it, a growing interest exists in developing new products with <b>radioprotector</b> character that diminish the adverse effects of the radiotherapy. The aminotioles (as the amifostina) they are agents that more they have been used with thispurpose; however they cause severe secondary effects. For this reason, the current tendency is focused to obtaining the <b>radioprotector</b> compounds from natural sources. The natural product, Vimang to obtains starting from the bark of Mangifera indica L, itconstitutes a interesting candidate for the character <b>radioprotector</b> evaluation if one keeps {{in mind that the}} pharmacological studies carried out until the moment, which corroborate their effectiveness like antinflammatory, analgesic, inmunomodulator and antioxidant.

This assays indicated that the extract is not genotoxic in the analyzed range of concentrations (50, 250, 500 and 1000 g/mL); in presence or not of metabolic activation. We conclude that this product is able to protect the cellular structure at the nuclear material level, of the damages induced by the gamma radiation to the doses studied in the SOS Chromotest assays...|$|E

40|$|Radiation has {{a potent}} to damage cells. Radiation may act {{directly}} or indirectly on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that results in the degeneration of tissues and necrotic, and thereby it needs a potent <b>radioprotector</b> to prevent these damages. Vitamin E is natural product known as an antioxidant which has potential as <b>radioprotector.</b> This research aimed to determine the capability of vitamin E with emphasized on the searching for its optimal concentration as <b>radioprotector</b> of DNA damage. This study used blood samples of healthy person irradiated with gamma rays at a dose of 6 Gy as the lethal dose to lymphocytes.

Evaluation on the capability of this compound in suppressing DNA damage was done by using alkaline Comet assay and data analysis was done using CaspLab program. The results show that addition of vitamin E could suppres these DNA damages and 0. 8 mM of vitamin could reduce DNA damage up to 94. 2 %.

Treated animals were given i. p. GM 2011 30 minutes before and 3 and 7 hours after irradiation. Controls consisted of sham irradiated animals without treatment and animals treated without irradiation. After 30 days post-irradiation, animals were sacrificed and bone marrow cells were prepared from isolated femurs. A colony forming unit-fibroblast (CFU-F) assay was performed to obtain the number of BM-MSCs. Results In the treated group, 87 % of animals survived, compared to only 30 % in the non-treated irradiated group. Irradiation induced significant changes in the bone marrow of the treated rats (total bone marrow cellularity was reduced by ~ 60 % – from 63 to 28 cells × 106 /femur and the frequency of the CFU-F per femur by ~ 70 % – from 357 to 97), however GL 2011 almost completely prevented the suppressive effect observed on day 30 post-irradiation (71 cells × 106 /femur and 230 CFU-F/femur).

30|$|This {{study found}} that the {{mitigating}} effects of indralin, when it is administered after exposure to supralethal dose of radiation and when it is administered together with shielding of the abdominal region of rats, can not be explained by hypoxic mechanisms of α 1 -adrenomimetic activity. <b>Radioprotectors</b> cannot neutralize the “oxygen effect” when they are admin-istered after radiation exposure. The mitigable effect of <b>radioprotectors</b> applied after irradiation on the haematopoietic tissue is implemented through their interference with the processes of accelerated proliferation and migration of stem cells and progenitor cells of the myeloid group from the haematopoietic tissues that are protected by partial shielding.|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{therapeutic}} {{ratio for}} ionising radiation treatment of tumour is a trade-off between normal tissue side-effects and tumour control. Application of a <b>radioprotector</b> to normal tissue can reduce side-effects. Here we study {{the effects of}} a new <b>radioprotector</b> on the cellular response to radiation. Methylproamine is a DNA-binding <b>radioprotector</b> which, on the basis of published pulse radiolysis studies, acts by repair of transient radiation-induced oxidative species on DNA. To substantiate this hypothesis, we studied protection by methylproamine at both clonogenic survival and radiation-induced DNA damage, assessed by γH 2 AX (histone 2 AX phosphorylation at serine 139) focus formation endpoints. Materials and methods: The human keratinocyte cell line FEP 1811 was used to study clonogenic survival and yield of γH 2 AX foci following irradiation (137 Cs γ-rays) of cells exposed to various concentrations of methylproamine. Uptake of methylproamine into cell nuclei was measured in parallel. Results: The extent of radioprotection at the clonogenic survival endpoint increased with methylproamine concentration up to a maximum dose modification factor (DMF) of 2. 0 at 10 [*]μM. At least 0. 1 fmole/nucleus of methylproamine is required to achieve a substantial level of radioprotection (DMF of 1. 3) with maximum protection (DMF of 2. 0) achieved at 0. 23 fmole/nucleus. The γH 2 AX focus yield per cell nucleus 45 [*]min after irradiation decreased with drug concentration with a DMF of 2. 5 at 10 [*]μM. Conclusions: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that radioprotection by methylproamine is mediated by attenuation of the extent of initial DNA damage. ...|$|E

40|$|Radiation {{exposures}} {{can occur}} without any prior warning {{in the following}} settings: radiography, nuclear medicine, radiotherapy, radiological imaging, radionuclide production, biomedical research, military, public domain, transportation, nuclear reactors, space flights etc. patients may be exposed to ionizing radiation during radiotherapy or following exposure to radionuclides in nuclear medicine. There is, therefore, a need to protect humans against planned(e. g. radiotherapy and nuclear medicine) and unplanned (e. g. industrial nuclear accident or nuclear war) exposures is necessary. <b>radioprotectors</b> are compounds that {{have the ability to}} reduce the biological effects of ionizing radiation on normal tissues, including lethality, mutagenicity and carcinogenicity, and have applications in clinical oncology, space travel, radiation site clean-up, radiological terrorism and military scenarios. The <b>radioprotectors</b> can elicit their action by various mechanisms such as: suppressing the formation of free radicals, inducing the cellular <b>radioprotectors</b> such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), enhancing the DNA repair and inducting hypoxia in the tissues. The most effective <b>radioprotectors</b> developed so far are aminothiols and their derivatives. Some of these compounds have been successfully used to prevent complications of radiation therapy in patients with cancer. Unfortunately, all of the aminothiols have toxic side effects that limit their use in medical practice. Results from animal experiments indicate that antioxidant nutrients, like vitamin A, C,E and selenium compounds, are protective against lethality and other radiation effects but to a lesser degree than most synthetic protectors. a large number of plants contain antioxidant phytochemicals reported to be radioprotective in various model systems. Clinical trials have not yet been undertaken with most herbal <b>radioprotectors.</b> If these are performed, herbal radioprotective drugs for human use from several of plants may soon be available. Therefore, the activity of numerous investigators is directed towards finding an effective radioprotective agents that would successfully prevent development of radiation syndrome and protect cells and tissue from deleterious effects of radiation. most of the compounds failed in their transition from laboratory to clinic.
