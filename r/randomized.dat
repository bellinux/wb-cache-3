30|$|While SALADS offers {{security}} advantages, {{it still}} has two major limitations. L- 1 : When SALADS <b>randomizes</b> a large set of data structures, it will significantly affect the performance. This further leads to the second limitation. L- 2 : For the consideration of performance, SALADS cannot afford to <b>randomize</b> all the data structures. Instead it <b>randomizes</b> a fixed sub-set of data structures. In {{the case that the}} data structures targeted by an attack are not covered, SALADS is essentially noneffective.|$|R

40|$|Sunspot {{equilibrium}} and lottery equilibrium are two stochastic solution concepts for nonstochastic economies. Recent work by Garratt, Keister, Qin, and Shell (in press) and Kehoe, Levine, and Prescott (in press) on nonconvex exchange economies {{has shown}} that when the <b>randomizing</b> device is continuous, applying the two concepts to the same fundamental economy yields {{the same set of}} equilibrium allocations. In the present paper, we examine economies based on a discrete <b>randomizing</b> device. We extend the lottery model so that it can constrain the randomization possibilities available to agents {{in the same way that}} the sunspots model can. Every equilibrium allocation of our generalized lottery model has a corresponding sunspot equilibrium allocation. For almost all discrete <b>randomizing</b> devices, the converse is also true. There are exceptions, however: for some <b>randomizing</b> devices, there exist sunspot equilibrium allocations with no lottery equilibrium counterpart. ...|$|R

25|$|There {{has been}} some {{controversy}} over the relative strengths {{of different types of}} research. Because <b>randomized</b> trials provide clear, objective evidence on “what works”, policy makers often take only those studies into consideration. Some scholars have pushed for more random experiments in which teaching methods are randomly assigned to classes. In other disciplines concerned with human subjects, like biomedicine, psychology, and policy evaluation, controlled, <b>randomized</b> experiments remain the preferred method of evaluating treatments. Educational statisticians and some mathematics educators have been working to increase the use of <b>randomized</b> experiments to evaluate teaching methods. On the other hand, many scholars in educational schools have argued against increasing the number of <b>randomized</b> experiments, often because of philosophical objections, such as the ethical difficulty of randomly assigning students to various treatments when the effects of such treatments are not yet known to be effective, or the difficulty of assuring rigid control of the independent variable in fluid, real school settings.|$|E
