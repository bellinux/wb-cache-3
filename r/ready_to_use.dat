5|$|In the past, the standard-bearer of the Mrkojevići clan, a Muslim, walked next to {{the cross}} with a flag in his left and a knife in his right hand, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it if anyone {{attempted}} to take the cross. The clan especially feared that the participants from Krajina might try to recover the sacred object. At the end of 19th century the number of Muslims in the procession dropped as their religious and political leaders disapproved of their participation in it. After World War II, Yugoslavia's socialist government discouraged public religious celebrations, and the procession was not held between 1959 and 1984.|$|E
5|$|To begin with, {{the number}} of the party members is {{extremely}} large. Millions of people believed in the National Socialist philosophy; they were influenced by the broadcasts of the Führer and the detailed party propaganda. Individual thinking was switched off, and the party members allowed their leaders to set the guidelines in everything for them--and this spread throughout the entire population. In this way, more fanatics were created who were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> brute force, and other means of terror, to eliminate any internal resistance.|$|E

25|$|The BMD-3 is {{equipped}} with two bow mounted secondary weapons for use against infantry and armored fighting vehicles. Mounted at the front left is a 30mm AGS-17 automatic grenade launcher. On the front right, a bow mounted 5.45×39mm RPK machine gun can be used. Each of the bow weapons is operated {{by one of the}} infantrymen seated {{in the front of the}} vehicle. For the AGS-17, there are 290 rounds of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ammunition, with an additional 261 stowed in the BMD-3. The RPK-74 holds 2160 rounds of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> ammunition. The 5.45mm RPK-74 is used for direct engagements up to 800 m, whereas the 30mm AGS-17 automatic grenade engages and suppresses targets at ranges out to 1,700 m using high-explosive fragmentation grenades. If required, these weapons can also be dismounted from the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Pride's {{rejection}} of every method {{of family planning}} in The Way Home was soon noticed by prominent members of the Couple to Couple League, a Catholic natural family planning (NFP) movement. John and Sheila Kippley in their The Art of Natural Family Planning describes how representatives of the organization contacted Pride to express concerns over her position. In 1989, Pride in her HELP for Growing Families periodical published portions of the correspondence between the Kippleys' and herself, during which Pride accepted NFP use only for couples who wished to remain healthy until they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> no fertility control at all. Sheila Kippley credits the correspondence as the reason why Pride accepted NFP in such circumstances in her sequel, All the Way Home.|$|E

Despite the absence of numerous first-team players due to injuries, he led the Greek club to a comfortable 2nd place in Group H of the Champions League, earning the qualification to the knockout stage. In the Greek Superleague his first results were also impressive, but the success lasted only till early winter and the fans started to complain about both the results and the playing style of the team. And they were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> violence against him (or his team) {{in order to achieve}} their ends. Finally on 19 January 2010, after a negative series of 4 matches with just one win, though his team lost only two times (twelve wins and four draws) in the Greek Superleague, Zico was sacked.|$|E

25|$|Though Brevity {{had failed}} to yield any {{territory}} to the British, it showed Rommel that his front line defences were quite easy to breach. Anticipating further British attacks, the Axis forces created a line of fortified positions from Halfaya to Sidi Azeiz, placing a number of anti-tank guns and anti-tank mines on the Halfaya Pass, Point 206 (south of Forth Capuzzo) and on Point 208 (west of Fort Capuzzo on the Hafid Ridge). The primary responsibility of the frontier defence was charged to the 15th Panzer Division, which had received a new commander, General Walter Neumann-Silkow, on 8 June. Poor signals security in the 7th Armoured Division, gave Rommel nine hours notice of the operation. Rommel sent the 5th Light Division {{to the south of}} Tobruk, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> it against either the Sollum area or on Tobruk and ordered a big artillery bombardment of Tobruk the night before the operation, to prevent the Allied garrison from breaking out.|$|E
25|$|Neame {{was ordered}} to {{conserve}} the tanks units, retire as far as Benghazi if pressed, to abandon it if necessary and hold the high ground nearby {{for as long as}} possible, with no prospect of reinforcement before May. Neame was to fight a delaying action up the Via Balbia towards Benghazi and then the defiles near Er Regima and Barce; the tanks would move to Antelat to operate against the flank and rear of an attacker moving up the road or across the desert to Tobruk, falling back on a flank if necessary. On 20 March, the 2nd Armoured Division took over from the Australians, who moved back to Tocra, near Er Regima. The force was to use depots at Msus, Tecnis, Martuba, Mechili and Tmimi, El Magrun and Bengahzi as a substitute for lorry-borne supply. The 3rd Indian Motor Brigade (Brigadier E. W. D. Vaughan) arrived in late March, with lorries but no tanks, artillery, anti-tank guns and only half its wireless sets; the brigade was based at Martuba, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> its vehicles to move towards Derna, Barce or Mechili.|$|E
25|$|This royal {{residence}} {{has been}} in the same location by Norrström {{in the northern part of}} Gamla stan in Stockholm since the middle of the 13th century when the Tre Kronor Castle was built. In modern times the name relates to the building called Kungliga Slottet. The palace was designed by Nicodemus Tessin the Younger and erected on the same place as the medieval Tre Kronor Castle which was destroyed in a fire on 7May 1697. Due to the costly Great Northern War which started in 1700, construction of the palace was halted in 1709, and not recommenced until 1727— six years after the war. When Tessin the Younger died in 1728, the palace was completed by Carl Hårleman who also designed a large part of its Rococo interior. The palace was not <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> until 1754, when King Adolf Frederick and Queen Louisa Ulrika moved in, but some interior work proceeded until the 1770s. No major conversions have been done in the palace since its completion, only some adjustments, new interiors, modernization and redecorating for different regents and their families, coloration of the facades and addition of the palace museums.|$|E

500|$|The role of {{radiotherapy}} as {{an auxiliary}} (adjuvant) treatment after potentially curative surgery has been controversial since the 1980s.

[...] However, there is a continuing tendency for clinicians in the US to be more <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>use</b> adjuvant radiotherapy than those in Europe.
