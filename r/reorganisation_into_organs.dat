25|$|According to Giosan et al. (2012), {{the slow}} southward {{migration}} of the monsoons across Asia initially allowed the Indus Valley villages to develop by taming the floods of the Indus and its tributaries. Flood-supported farming led to large agricultural surpluses, {{which in turn}} supported the development of cities. The IVC residents did not develop irrigation capabilities, relying mainly on the seasonal monsoons leading to summer floods. Brooke further notes {{that the development of}} advanced cities coincides with a reduction in rainfall, which may have triggered a <b>reorganisation</b> <b>into</b> larger urban centers.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effects of actual and {{hypothetical}} changes in league structure on match attendances for English rugby league. An empirical match attendance model is used to generate simulated attendances under various alternative structural regimes. The simulations are {{used to compare the}} effects on attendances of having larger and smaller divisions, and of having regionalised lower divisions or divisions whose membership is determined solely by playing quality. A limited form of regionalisation emerges as a positive recommendation. The model is also used to decompose the changes in average attendance, following the 1996 <b>reorganisation,</b> <b>into</b> components attributable to the change of structure, changes in team performance, and other factors. ...|$|R

25|$|The first M 18 {{to enter}} service with NOBA was {{provided}} by Messerschmitt {{in exchange for a}} 49% share of the new company, and on 26 July it began commercial flights.

Following NOBA's <b>reorganisation</b> <b>into</b> DEVAG in 1931, a small number of a further-improved version, designated M 18d, were ordered, but the type was soon superseded by the similar but larger Messerschmitt M 20.|$|R
50|$|The {{players and}} {{committee}} {{took on the}} task of restoring the present Moor Lane ground. The pitch was in poor condition, the main stand roofless and derelict. Working all hours the challenge was met head on and Moor Lane was passed as acceptable for entry to the Cheshire League in 1980. When the North West Counties League was formed in 1982 with the amalgamation of the Lancashire Combination and the Cheshire League, the foresight of upgrading the ground bore fruit and Salford seized the opportunity of joining football's non-league pyramid. The transition has not always been easy but with the <b>reorganisation</b> <b>into</b> two divisions the club eventually took their place in Division One.|$|R

30|$|In {{the first}} {{description}} of “systems biomedicine” in 1992, Kamada noted: “In clinical biomedical engineering ultrasound, radioisotopes and electromagnetic resonances {{have been applied}} for non-invasive, speedy and reproducible real-time monitoring of patients”, and “Medical scientists begin to consider humans to be “holon”. Accordingly, a disease {{is not only the}} malfunction of an organ, but of a control mechanism of a human body, a “holon” [36]. In 1981, in a paper on the human cancer model, ZaJicek stated: “The organism is stratified into hierarchies among which the cell represents the lowest. Cells are aggregated into tissues and tissues, <b>into</b> <b>organs.</b> <b>Organs</b> are assembled <b>into</b> <b>organ</b> systems constituting the human organism. In each hierarchy an elementary unit, or holon is defined.” [37]. Therefore, as radiomics is part of system medicine, {{it is important to understand}} the link between radiomics and other “omics”.|$|R
