50|$|The M1867 rolling block rifle {{became very}} popular among {{civilian}} hunters in Sweden, particularly for moose hunting, {{which led to}} Husqvarna Vapenfabrik producing about 85,000 rifles with the M1867 Remington <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> for the civilian market, {{in addition to the}} more than 100,000 they made for the armed forces. Surplus military rifles were also sold to civilians, most them being converted to 12.17×44mmR centerfire cartridges.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> {{is a form}} of {{firearm action}} where the sealing of the breech is done with a {{specially}} shaped breechblock able to rotate on a pin. The breechblock is shaped like a section of a circle.The breechblock is locked into place by the hammer, thus preventing the cartridge from moving backwards at the moment of firing. By cocking the hammer, the breechblock can be rotated freely to reload the weapon.|$|E
50|$|During the U.S. Civil War, Joseph Rider {{experimented with}} several breech loading weapon designs. In 1865, he was issued the first patent {{for what would}} evolve into the Remington <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action.</b> The Remingtons {{continued}} to invest in Rider's work, and met with Ordnance Department officials {{in the hope of}} interesting them in this new design. The U.S. Navy Ordnance Department became interested in the design, and purchased several different models of rifles from 1867 through 1869. Field trials of these various rifles yielded mostly positive results.|$|E
50|$|The break open {{action is}} one of the most compact {{firearms}} actions. Since there are no parts to reciprocate, it is shorter than repeating designs, and generally more compact than non-repeating firearms such as the falling <b>block</b> and <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> <b>actions.</b> This compactness results in reductions in weight and size compared to larger actions; this can also allow a longer barrel in a firearm of similar size.|$|R
5000|$|About 200,000-220,000 {{military}} {{rifles and}} 7,000 military carbines using the m/1867 action were manufactured as complete weapons in Sweden, 100,000-120,000 rifles and 4,000 carbines by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori (a government owned arsenal) and 100,000 rifles and 3,000 carbines by Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag. In {{addition to that}} 10,000 complete rifles and 20,000 actions made in the US were bought from Remington. The standard rifle received the Swedish designation [...] "gevär m/1867" [...] (and a version with only minor differences the designation [...] "gevär m/1867-68"). Approximately 30,000 Swedish muzzle-loading rifles m/1860 and breech-loading rifles m/1864 (some {{of which had been}} converted from m/1860; note that the Swedish breech-loading rifle m/1864 although being referred to as a [...] "kammarladdare" [...] was not the same rifle as the Norwegian Kammerlader) of the same caliber, rifles that were almost new and in most cases had never been used, were also converted to M1867 Remington <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> using <b>actions</b> made both by Remington and in Sweden. The Swedish designations for the converted rifles were [...] "gevär m/1860-68", [...] "gevär m/1864-68" [...] and [...] "gevär m/1860-64-68" [...] depending on how many steps of conversion they had gone through (the two latter conversions are easily recognized by having the rear sight very far back, a result of the barrels being shortened from the breech end). About 7,000 short carbines with the Swedish designation [...] "karbin m/1870" [...] were also made, and in addition to that about 9,600 [...] "gevär m/1864-68" [...] were shortened to carbine length in 1886-87 and given the designation [...] "karbin m/1864-68-85". Other varieties were [...] "gevär m/1867-74" [...] with a new rear stock design and [...] "kammarskjutningsgevär m/1884" [...] and [...] "kammarskjutningskarbin m/1884" [...] in 10,15x61R Jarmann (rifles and carbines primarily used for gallery shooting, that is short range training).|$|R

This single-shot, large-caliber black-powder cartridge rifle was exported in the millions all over the world, including shipments to France, Egypt, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Belgium, Argentina, Mexico and the Papal States.

In most mazes, the blocks have size k × m × n where k, m, n are integers that determine {{the size of the}} block in terms of units {{of the size of the}} board cells. The task of a <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> maze is to roll a particular block from a starting to an ending placement. A block is rolled by tipping it over one of its edges.

5000|$|A new Swedish-Norwegian arms {{commission}} {{set up in}} the 1880s {{suggested that}} the Norwegian M1884 Jarmann rifle should replace the m/1867 in both Swedish and Norwegian service but the Jarmann rifle was rejected by the Swedish Army since the 10.15x61mmR cartridge used by the Jarmann rifle was seen as being too little of an improvement over the 12.17 mm cartridge used in the Model 1867 rifles. So as a stop-gap measure rifles and carbines with <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> <b>action</b> were converted to a for that time period very modern centerfire cartridge, the 8×58mmR Danish Krag (bullet diameter [...]322 in/8.17mm, bullet weight 237 grains/15.29 grams, muzzle velocity 1,965 ft per second/600 m/s), with the designation [...] "gevär m/1867-89" [...] used for converted rifles and [...] "gevär m/1889" [...] used for new rifles. Rolling block rifles chambered for the 8×58mmR were shorter than the M1867 rifles, with an overall length of 1,240 mm (48.8 in) and a barrel length of 840 mm (33.1 in).|$|E

50|$|A <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> can be {{described}} as a quadrant which is hinged below the breech. The quardant rotates through approximately 90° to provide access to the breech or close the breech. In the closed position, a number of different devices can be used to lock the quadrant and prevent it from opening. In the Remington Rolling Block rifle most closely associated with this type of breechblock, the hammer also has a quadrant which cams behind the breechblock and locks it. The Spencer repeating rifle also uses a <b>rolling</b> <b>block.</b>|$|R

50|$|The Model 1867 Remington <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> rifle was {{the first}} rifle using {{metallic}} cartridges to be adopted by the Swedish and Norwegian armies. Nominally it had a caliber of 4 decimal lines, but the actual caliber was 4.1 Swedish decimal lines or 3.88 Norwegian decimal lines (12.17 mm), and it fired a rimfire round with a 12.615 mm (.497 in) lead bullet. The 12.17 mm caliber was chosen because the Swedish army had approximately 30,000 new muzzle-loading Model 1860 and breech-loading Model 1864 rifles in 12.17 mm caliber in stock, rifles that were suitable for conversion to Model 1867 <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> rifles. With {{the exception of the}} first 10,000 rifles and 20,000 actions (for conversions of older rifles), which were made by Remington in the US, all Model 1867 Remington <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> rifles and carbines were made under license in Sweden and Norway, by Carl Gustafs stads Gevärsfaktori and Husqvarna Vapenfabriks Aktiebolag in Sweden and by Kongsberg Vaapenfabrik in Norway, with the two Swedish manufacturers producing about 80% of the weapons.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} the computational complexity of two maze problems, namely <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> and Alice mazes. Simply speaking, {{in the former}} game one has to roll blocks through a maze, ending in a particular game situation, and in the latter one, one has to move tokens of variable speed through a maze following some prescribed directions. It turns out that {{when the number of}} blocks or the number of tokens is not restricted (unbounded),then the problem of solving such a maze becomes PSPACE-complete. Hardness is shown via a reduction from the nondeterministic constraint logic (NCL) of Demaine and Hearn to the problems in question. In this way we improve on a previous PSPACE-completeness result of Buchin and Buchin on <b>rolling</b> <b>block</b> mazes to best possible. Moreover, we also consider bounded variants of these maze games, i. e., when the number of blocks or tokens is bounded by a constant, and prove close relations to variants of graph reachability problems...|$|R
