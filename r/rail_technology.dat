25|$|The {{government}} actively {{promoted the}} export of high-speed <b>rail</b> <b>technology</b> to countries including Mexico, Thailand, the United Kingdom, India, Russia and Turkey.

25|$|British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) began researching {{developments}} in light <b>rail</b> <b>technology</b> around the world, and in 1986 identified a light rail vehicle {{designed by the}} Urban Transportation Development Corporation in Canada for the Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (UTDC) in California, USA, {{as an example of}} the type of LRV that could run in British cities. BREL planned to organise a live demonstration by shipping a UTDC vehicle which had been on display at the 1986 World Expo in Vancouver. Manchester was selected as the preferred venue for the demonstration as the city had the most developed light rail proposals, but negotiations to loan the vehicle fell through and the event was postponed until spring 1987.|$|E

50|$|In the US, {{some of the}} interurbans (i.e. trams or streetcars which {{run from}} city to city) of the early 20th century were very {{high-speed}} for their time (also Europe had and still does have some interurbans).

2500|$|In 1978, the MTDB {{successfully}} {{negotiated with}} SP {{to purchase the}} SD for $18.1 million, including the $1.3 million required to restore the hurricane-damaged freight line. [...] This was a dual-intent decision, to preserve both rail freight services to the Imperial Valley, and to preserve available right-of-way for future transit use. [...] In light of cheaper light-rail options identified in the MTDB and San Diego County studies, more expensive options such as a proposed $325 million rail-rapid transit line on a new right-of-way to the border seemed less competitive. [...] There was universal agreement that using the SD right-of-way and light <b>rail</b> <b>technology</b> was more economical and practical than a new rail-rapid transit line.|$|E
2500|$|When {{electric}} streetcars {{were introduced}} in the late 19th century, conduit current collection {{was one of the}} first ways of supplying power, but it proved to be much more expensive, complicated, and trouble-prone than overhead wires. When electric street railways became ubiquitous, conduit power was used in those cities that did not permit overhead wires. In Europe, it was used in London, Paris, Berlin, Marseille, Budapest, and Prague. In the United States, it was used in parts of New York City and Washington, DC. Third <b>rail</b> <b>technology</b> was investigated for use on the Gold Coast of Australia for the [...] light rail, though power from overhead lines was ultimately utilized for that system.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{original}} tram and streetcar {{systems in}} the United Kingdom, United States, and elsewhere were decommissioned starting in the 1950s as {{the popularity of the}} automobile increased.

Although some traditional trolley or tram systems exist to this day, the term [...] "light rail" [...] has come to mean a different type of rail system. Modern light <b>rail</b> <b>technology</b> has primarily West German origins, since an attempt by Boeing Vertol to introduce a new American light rail vehicle was a technical failure. After World War II, the Germans retained many of their streetcar networks and evolved them into model light rail systems (Stadtbahnen).

2500|$|The first railway to be {{built in}} China was a 600-meter narrow gauge {{demonstration}} line that a British merchant assembled in Beijing in 1864 to demonstrate <b>rail</b> <b>technology.</b> [...] The Qing government was uninterested and had the line dismantled. [...] The first railroad to enter commercial service was the Woosung Railway, a 9 ¼ mi (14 km) railway from Shanghai to Woosung (modern Shanghai's Baoshan District) which opened in 1876. [...] This was also built by the British, without approval from the Qing government, which had the line dismantled one year later. [...] Until the defeat of China in the First Sino-Japanese War, the government remained hostile toward railway construction. Beginning in 1895, the government began to grant rail concessions to foreigners, and permitted direct connection to the capital Beijing.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{experiment}} toward high-speed rail, the New York Central (NYC) fitted {{a pair of}} jet engines from a Convair B-36, complete in their twinned nacelle from the bomber's engine installation, atop one of their RDCs and added a shovel nose front (much like a later automotive air dam) to its cab, but extended upwards, covering the entire front end. This RDC, which NYC had numbered M497, set the United States speed record in 1966 when it traveled at just short of [...] between Butler, Indiana, and Stryker, Ohio. It was never intended that jet engines propel regular trains. With the news about high-speed trains overseas, particularly the Japanese Shinkansen bullet trains, American railroads were under pressure to catch up. By strapping a pair of military surplus jet engines onto a Budd car, NYC found an inexpensive way to conduct research into how conventional <b>rail</b> <b>technology</b> behaves at very high speeds.|$|E
