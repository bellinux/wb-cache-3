40|$|Summary. Result {{of expert}} {{information}} processing is {{to construct a}} binary preference relation {{on the basis of}} which will be the choice. One of the most important properties of this relationship is transitive. However, due to the incompleteness of the human information processing system, when evaluating the sampling results are random errors, due to which may occur intransitive and inconsistency in preferences. Largely a problem of violations of transitivity individual expert <b>ranking</b> <b>stems</b> {{from the fact that the}} expert, comparing alternatives in pairs, generally speaking, is not obliged to think about how to relate these alternatives with all other. In this case it is likely a violation of consistency preferences that make useless the further processing of examination results. In this paper we propose: new universal algorithm for estimating transitive relations expert preferences when ordering of the original sample of alternatives on ordinal scale; modified algorithm for estimating the consistency of expert judgment and construction of structural matrices of various expert preferences between all pairs of alternatives sample which the ranking on difference- classification scale. The basic idea of the algorithm is to on the basis of the support matrices of paired comparisons of individual alternatives to sample to provide not only a review of profile expert orderings on the transitivity, but at the end of the survey of experts to form the structural matrix of all possible preferences between all pairs of sampling alternatives. These algorithms make use of the original information in the form of a matrix of paired comparisons of alternatives to individual sample. The article gives examples illustrating the operation of the above algorithms...|$|R
40|$|The major {{emphasis}} {{of this paper}} is on analytical techniques for predicting the performance of various collection fusion scenarios. Knowledge of analytical models of information retrieval system performance, both with single processors and with multiple processors, increases our understanding of the parameters (e. g., number of documents, <b>ranking</b> algorithms, <b>stemming</b> algorithms, stop word lists, etc.) affecting system behavior. While there is a growing literature on the implementation of distributed information retrieval systems and digital libraries, little research has focused on analytic models of performance. We analytically describe the performance for single and multiple processors, both when different processors have the same parameter values and when they have different values. The use of different ranking algorithms and parameter values at different sites is examined...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The {{accurate}} computational {{prediction of}} RNA secondary structures {{is a difficult}} task, but an important one, since RNA structure is usually more evolutionarily conserved than primary sequence. We describe a dynamic programming algorithm called FoldRRS (Folding of RNA by <b>Ranking</b> of <b>Stems)</b> that predicts a consensus secondary structure from a multiple sequence alignment. Our algorithm exploits the use of k-length stems (k = 2) to acquire base pairing probability and covariation information from individual sequences. We test sequences from the BRAliBase I data set [1] and the Rfam database [2]. Our results were compared against three algorithms, RNAalifold, Pfold, and KNetFold, that are similar in nature. FoldRRS exhibits an increase in accuracy over the other programs in data sets which contain longer and/or more numerous sequences...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} mitigating intentional jam-ming in navigation receivers using smart antennas. For example, GPS receivers provide high precision location information needed in many military and civilian applications. The signal powers em-ployed are so low that navigation receivers are a lucrative target for intentional jamming. Consequently, {{it is important to}} use advanced receiver structures that can deal with different types of jamming. Space-time processing methods used in the receiver provide suffi-cient number of degrees of freedom for cancelling large number of wideband jammers. In this paper a low <b>rank</b> method <b>stemming</b> from multistage Wiener filtering (MSWF) is developed. A Householder transform based method for generating unitary blocking matrices is proposed. The computation of blocking matrices is efficient and the actual blocking operation has low complexity, too. The reliable performance of the method is demonstrated in anti-jamming GPS reception where a good number of both narrowband and wideband jammers are cancelled. 1...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} a new notion of rank for a semigroup S. The rank is associated with pairs (I,ρ), where ρ is a right congruence and I is a ρ-saturated right ideal. We allow I to be the empty set; {{in this case the}} rank of (∅, ρ) is the Cantor-Bendixson rank of ρ in the lattice of right congruences of S, with respect to a topology we title the finite type topology. If all pairs have rank, then we say that S is ranked. Our notion of rank is intimately connected with chain conditions: every right Noetherian semigroup is ranked, and every ranked inverse semigroup is weakly right Noetherian. Our interest in <b>ranked</b> semigroups <b>stems</b> from the study of the class ± bES of existentially closed S-sets over a right coherent monoid S. It is known that for such S the set of sentences in the language of S-sets that are true in every existentially closed S-set, that is, the theory TS of ± bES, has the model theoretic property of being stable. Moreover, TS is superstable if and only if S is weakly right Noetherian. In the present article, we show that TS satisfies the stronger property of being totally transcendental if and only if S is ranked and weakly right Noetherian...|$|R

The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate clonal variation in four hybrid poplar clones grown at three sites in North China and identify the superior clone. Study materials were collected from four clones of hybrid white poplar: Populus tomentosa “LM 50 ”, used as the control; two clones (Yiyang- 1 and Yiyang- 2), new hybrids of (P. tomentosa × P. bolleana) × P. tomentosa “Truncata”; and Yiyang- 3, a new hybrid of (P. tomentosa × P. bolleana) × P. tomentosa “LM 50 ”. In total, 192 individuals from four hybrid clones were randomly chosen for sampling. The growth traits of four 7 -year-old clones were examined at three sites. We also measured the wood properties of four 6 -year-old clones at the Fengfeng nursery. Variation in the growth traits and the <b>ranking</b> of <b>stem</b> volumes differed among sites. Fiber traits and wood chemical components showed significant interclonal variation.

The whole stover was separated into stem and leaves (leaf blade and sheath). The evaluation was based on morphological proportion, chemical composition, and in situ dry matter degradability. Stem contribution to whole stover was significantly varied from 65. 4 % for Himacy to 35. 1 % for Fetrita. No significant difference in crude protein (CP) content between the sorghum stover fractions. The stem tended to have a lower ash and silica content compared to leaves. Neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and lignin levels were highest (P Fetrita > Tabat > Hageen > Himacy. <b>Stems</b> <b>ranked</b> as followed; Tabat > Fetrita > Wad Ahmed > Hageen > Himacy in out flow rate of 0. 02 h- 1.

The cohorts in this study are a combination of modular Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (BHR) and Adept femoral heads on CPT stems. The study reviews the geometry of the taper interfaces to establish if the taper clearance angles was outside of the normal range for other taper interfaces. In addition the rates of material loss from the bearings and taper and a <b>ranking</b> of the <b>stem</b> damage were reviewed to determine if the levels of loss were above that seen for other similar joints. The material loss analysis demonstrated that the rates or levels of loss from the bearings, taper and stem were no different to levels published for manufacturer matched joints and in many cases were lower. The results demonstrate that the taper clearance angles for the mixed manufacturer joints (BHR-CPT: 0. 067 to - 0. 116, Adept-CPT: 0. 101 to - 0. 056) were within the range of other studies and manufacturer matched clearances (0. 134 to - 0. 149). Using components from different manufacturers has not in this instance increased the level of material loss from the joints, when compared to other similar manufacturer matched joints. <br/...|$|R

Virtual stands of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) across a range of structure types were stochastically generated and random sampling was simulated. We compared the bias and accuracy of stand quadratic mean diameter estimates, employing different <b>ranks</b> of measured <b>stems</b> from a set of the 10 trees nearest to the sampling point. We proposed several modifications of the original Weise’s rule based on the measurement and averaging of two different ranks centered to a target rank. In accordance with the original formulation of the empirical rule, we recommend the application of the measurement of the 6 th <b>stem</b> in <b>rank</b> corresponding to the 55 % sample percentile of diameter distribution, irrespective of mean diameter size and degree of diameter dispersion. The study also revealed that the application of appropriate two-measurement modifications of Weise’s method, the 4 th and 8 th ranks or 3 rd and 9 th ranks averaged to the 6 th central rank, should be preferred over the classic one-measurement estimation. The modified versions are characterised by an improved accuracy (about 25 %) without statistically significant bias and measurement costs comparable to the classic Weise method...|$|R
40|$|The leaf angle between {{stem and}} sheath (SSA) is an {{important}} rice morphological trait. The objective {{of this study was}} to develop and validate a dynamic SSA model under different nitrogen (N) rates for selected rice cultivars. The time-course data of SSA were collected in three years, and a dynamic SSA model was developed for different main <b>stem</b> leaf <b>ranks</b> under different N rates for two selected rice cultivars. SSA increased with tiller age. The SSA of the same leaf rank increased with increase in N rate. The maximum SSA increased with leaf rank from the first to the third leaf, then decreased from the third to the final leaf. The relationship between the maximum SSA and leaf <b>rank</b> on main <b>stem</b> could be described with a linear piecewise function. The change of SSA with thermal time (TT) was described by a logistic equation. A variety parameter (the maximum SSA of the 3 rd leaf on main stem) and a nitrogen factor were introduced to quantify the effect of cultivar and N rate on SSA. The model was validated against data collected from both pot and field experiments. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) was 11. 56 % and 14. 05 %, respectively. The resulting models could be used for virtual rice plant modeling and plant-type design...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Sufficient primary {{stability}} {{is a prerequisite}} for the clinical success of cementless implants. Therefore, {{it is important to have}} an estimation of the primary stability that can be achieved with new stem designs in a pre-clinical trial. Fast assessment of the primary {{stability is}} also useful in the preoperative planning of total hip replacements, and to an even larger extent in intraoperatively custom-made prosthesis systems, which result in a wide variety of stem geometries. Methods An analytical model is proposed to numerically predict the relative primary stability of cementless hip stems. This analytical approach is based upon the principle of virtual work and a straightforward mechanical model. For five custom-made implant designs, the resistance against axial rotation was assessed through the analytical model as well as through finite element modelling (FEM). Results The analytical approach can be considered as a first attempt to theoretically evaluate the primary stability of hip stems without using FEM, which makes it fast and inexpensive compared to other methods. A reasonable agreement was found in the stability <b>ranking</b> of the <b>stems</b> obtained with both methods. However, due to the simplifying assumptions underlying the analytical model it predicts very rigid stability behaviour: estimated stem rotation was two to three orders of magnitude smaller, compared with the FEM results. Conclusion Based on the results of this study, the analytical model might be useful as a comparative tool for the assessment of the primary stability of cementless hip stems. </p...|$|R
