The study was therefore conducted as a survey with the sample of the responding firms being from Block 7 of East of Nairobi region as classified by the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). A structures questionnaire was used to collect the data based mainly on the Likert Scale. This study found that the SMEs most strongly felt that the mode of payment <b>of</b> the <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> was time consuming and tedious and that they encountered problems when filing <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> returns. However, the frequency of filing tax returns was not viewed as having an effect on <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> collection. The SMEs indicated that they did not understand their obligations and the tax office did not value feedback about the way the tax system was which greatly affected <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> collection. The <b>turnover</b> was found to be prohibitive and higher than profit. Tax officers contributed to the <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> collection problem since they accepted bribes when offered to reduce tax liability or demanded for bribes when they visited. Further, the government failed to involve taxpayers when formulating tax policies with no visible improvements in government services. There was also poor political goodwill towards <b>turnover</b> <b>tax.</b> The suggested effective remedies for <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> collection included: putting in place tough laws to check evaders, frequent taxpayer education and sensitization, putting in place mechanisms to address public misconceptions or inaccuracies and providing information in a customer-focused way to reduce error.

This paper empirically examines the effect of this exogenous, institutional change in tax policy on stock trading volume in the Japanese market. To do so, we use panel data of stocks traded in both the Japanese and United States markets and compare changes in their trading volumes at the times of the tax changes. We use a well-established V-shape relationship between turnover and price change, with three different assumptions as regards how the price change relates to turnover across stocks and markets. Although a model allowing for both slope and intercept shifts does not offer any indications one way or the other, a more restricted model allowing only for an intercept shift clearly suggests a statistically significant increase in trading volume in the Japanese market but not in the United States markets for April 1999. However, such a result was not obtained for April 1996. These results indicate that the abolition <b>of</b> <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> in 1999, but not the rate reduction in 1996, contributed to the trading volume increase. <b>Turnover</b> <b>tax</b> Taxation on financial transactions Stock trading volume Japanese...|$|R

In the 1995 – 2000 period, the resulting gap between CPI and PPI led to massive foreign capital inflows.

There was introduced the value added tax system with differentiated rates, which remained in competency of governments of the individual states in 1973. The primary effort, after the implementation of the value added tax, was to complete the structural harmonization at first and then to try to harmonize the tax rates. The aim of all the above introduced efforts is to contribute to smooth functioning of the internal market (Široký 2007).

The district people's councils might work out medium-range plans, where the investment plan {{would be one of the}} elements. This could become the basis to work out yearly assignments for single service enterprises. As it appears synthetic measures supplemented with natural ones may be most adequate because they control the correct trends of their activities. As regards prices the author suggests that (the number of services centrally controlled should be limited and prices should be seasonally changed to be adjusted to the fluctuation of demand. He proposes a formula depending on counting in profil, <b>turnover</b> <b>tax</b> and overhead costs according to the interest on fixed and working assets of the enterprise to direct costs (particularly wages). To secure quantitative and qualitative development of services it is necessary to employ such a system of wages that the earnings of skilled service workers may be as those in the other branches of then national economy or even higher. As regards the supply a general reform in the national economy is needed. A antralization of the stock record of the spare parts is necessary for a proper management. The author suggests that a bonus fund should be built out of the profits to increase an influence upon the extend and direction of economic activities of service enterprises.

The tax is levied on the consumption thereof and the group <b>of</b> <b>turnover</b> <b>taxes.</b> The VAT model under Bulgarian law follows the common VAT regime within the EU model, where personal expenses are taxable by applying the credit (invoice) method. According to this method, each stage of production of goods or services and the implementation thereof to end users is chargeable with VAT on the entire value of the supply, such that through the mechanism of tax credit the final price of the goods or services includes a single VAT charge in the amount of the respective tax rate.A taxable person is any person who independently carries out an economic activity, whatever the purpose and results of that activity, as well as any person who performs accidental onerous intra-European Union supplies of new transport vehicles. „Independent economic activity” are the activities of producers, traders and persons supplying services, including mining and agriculture, as well as the practice of a liberal profession, including as private enforcement agents and notaries.|$|R

The author presents economic, fiscal and social effects of a value added tax. The considerations are illustrated by examples taken from the tax legislation of the EEC countries among which only Greece does not provide for a value added tax. The author refers to postulates of introducing the said tax in Poland. He claims that at present the economic and financial situation in Poland is not mature enough to introduce a value added tax.

The framework combines an institutional dimension (distinguishing between supranational, joint-decision and intergovernmental modes of EU policy making) and a policy dimension (distinguishing between market-creating, market-enabling, market-correcting and redistributive policies). As institutional modes differ in their capacity for conflict resolution, and as policy types differ in the likelihood of severe policy conflict, greater or lesser problem-solving capacity can be explained by the location of a particular policy area on both of these dimensions. Aus Anlass der Evaluierung des Max-Planck-Instituts für Gesellschaftsforschung entwickelt dieses Working Paper einen Bezugsrahmen, in dem die Ergebnisse der am Institut betriebenen Forschung zur europäischen Mehrebenenpolitik im Kontext der internationalen Literatur eingeordnet und diskutiert werden können. Der Bezugsrahmen verbindet eine institutionelle Dimension (in der zwischen supranationalen, verflochtenen und intergouvernementalen Interaktionsformen unterschieden wird) mit einer Policy-Dimension (in der zwischen marktschaffenden, marktfördernden, markt-korrigierenden und redistributiven Policy-Typen unterschieden wird). Da Interaktionsformen sich in ihrer Konfliktregelungskapazität, und da Policy-Typen sich in ihrer Konfliktwahrscheinlichkeit unterscheiden, kann die größere oder geringere Problemlösungsfähigkeit in einem bestimmten Politikfeld durch dessen Lage in beiden Dimensionen erklärt werden.
