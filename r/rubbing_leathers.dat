60|$|At seven o'clock, as {{had been}} {{arranged}} when they arrived, {{all the members of}} the band met at the bivouac for supper. There was a general feeling of excitement among them. They had known that hostilities must soon begin, but to find that the line had already been cut, and that the enemy were closing in in all directions, came almost as a surprise. This, however, in no way prevented them from enjoying their meal. After it was over they held, at Chris's suggestion, a sort of council. He had already told them what the general had said to him, and that they were to be inspected in the morning. As their saddlery was all new, there was nothing to be done in the way of burnishing buckles and <b>rubbing</b> up <b>leather.</b> As Chris remarked, all that would be necessary was an hour's work in the morning grooming their horses.|$|R

Over the next fifty years, he would compose more than 250 film scores, {{the high point of}} which was his 1954 music for Ishir≈ç Honda's Toho movie, Godzilla. Ifukube also created Godzilla's trademark roar - produced by <b>rubbing</b> a resin-covered <b>leather</b> glove along the loosened strings of a double bass - and its footsteps, created by striking an amplifier box.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{realizes the}} hazards of {{chromium}} contamination and pollution caused {{by the use of}} Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers commonly used in cotton roller ginning industries and attempts to eliminate the chromium contamination and pollution during the complete process. Most of the cotton ginning operations are performed by using double roller (DR) ginning machines which serve {{an important role in the}} cotton ginning industries. The rollers used in these industries are made of Chrome Composite Leather-Cladding (CCLC) covering fixed to a shaft. The CCLC coverings contain about 18 000 to 36 000 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in DR ginning machines, the lint cotton is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the cotton ginning process due to persistent <b>rubbing</b> of <b>leather</b> over stationary knife the chromium particles are carried into lint cotton such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance and are vulnerable to health hazards. To offset thi...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyzes}} {{dependence of}} mechanical properties (breaking force, elongation at break, static friction force and static friction coefficient) on integrated fabric structure factor j and raw material density r, among the fabrics of different raw material (cotton, wool, polypropylene, polyester and polyacrylnitrile) and woven in different conditions. The received results demonstrate that sometimes strong dependences exist (wool, polypropylene and polyacrylnitrile), whereas {{in some cases}} (cotton and polyester) there is no correlation. It was also discovered that the breaking force and elongation at break {{in the direction of}} weft increase, when fabric structure becomes more rigid. In the meantime variations of the curves in the direction of warp are insignificant. Regarding static friction force and static friction coefficient (found in two cases, when fabrics were <b>rubbing</b> against <b>leather</b> and materials), it was discovered that consistency of the curves is irregular, i. e. they either increase or decrease, when integrated fabric structure factor j growth. It was also identified that some dependences are not strong and relationship between explored and analyzed factors does not exist. Variation of all these mechanical properties with respect to material density r enables to conclude that increase of material density r results in poor dependences or they are whatsoever non-existent.

5|$|Franklin's machine used a {{belt and}} pulley system that could be {{operated}} by one person turning a crank. A large pulley {{was attached to the}} crank-handle, and a much smaller pulley was attached to a large glass globe. An iron axle passed through the globe. This allowed the globe to be rotated at high speed. When the crank was turned, the glass globe <b>rubbed</b> against a <b>leather</b> pad, which generated a large static charge, similar to the electrical charge that could be created by rubbing a glass tube with wool cloth by hand. The machine was unique improvement over others made in Europe at the time, as the glass globe could be spun faster with much less labor. A few revolutions of the handle was all that was needed to charge a Leyden jar.|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{discusses}} the pollution caused by Chrome Composite Leather-Clad (CCLC) rollers {{commonly used in}} cotton roller ginning industries and suggests an alternative roller material. The CCLC rollers contain about 18000 to 36000 mg/kg (ppm) total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic and carcinogenic to human health. When the seed-cotton is processed in Double Roller (DR) ginning machines, the lint is contaminated with chromium of about 140 to 1990 ppm as against the safety limits of 0. 1 ppm. During the ginning process due to persistent <b>rubbing</b> of <b>leather</b> over stationary knife, chromium particles are carried into the lint such that the spun yarns and cotton by-products contain about 100 to 200 ppm, which according to world environmental standards should not be more than 0. 1 ppm. Gin and mill workers are directly exposed to this carcinogenic substance. To offset this problem, pollution-free Rubberized Cotton Fabric (RCF) rollers have been fabricated, used and experimented in roller gins. RCF roller covering is made of multiple layers of fabrics bonded together using white rubber compounding which has a surface finish conducive to high ginning efficiency. This nullifies chromium contamination and pollution during the ginning process. On {{the basis of the}} design and development of various rollers with subsequent performance evaluation studies, pollution-free RCF washers / rollers have been demonstrated with reference to techno-commercial and eco-friendliness in ginneries.

5000|$|A pericardial {{friction}} rub is a {{very specific}} sign of acute pericarditis, meaning {{the presence of this}} sign invariably indicates presence of disease. However, absence of this sign does not rule out disease. This rub can be best heard by the diaphragm of the stethoscope at the left sternal border arising as a squeaky or scratching sound, resembling the sound of <b>leather</b> <b>rubbing</b> against each other. This sound should be distinguished from the sound of a murmur, which is similar but sounds more like a [...] "swish" [...] sound than a scratching sound. The pericardial rub is said to be generated from the friction generated by the two inflamed layers of the pericardium; however, even a large pericardial effusion does not necessarily present a rub. The rub is best heard during the maximal movement of the heart within the pericardial sac, namely, during atrial systole, ventricular systole, and the filling phase of early ventricular diastole.|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of screen printing on suede leather is the method to improve a high fashion of the apparel material. The motif was applied on the flesh or {{the grain of}} suede lether by screening method. The objective {{of this research is}} to identify the effect of using the pigment and aniline dye on the adhesion of the finish and the <b>rub</b> fastness suede <b>leather</b> finished with screen printing and also to add a kind of type of finish leather. In this research suede leather was used and colour paste with formulation of binder 350 grams, thickener 100 grams, pigment / aniline 150 grams, filler 70 grams, catalisator 20 grams and water 310 grams. The suede leathers were analyzed their adhesion of the finish (dry and wet) and the rub fastness (dry and wet). The results showed that the pigment and aniline affected the adhesion of the finish but did not affect the rub fastness. The adhesion of the finish of suede leather with pigment colour was 2130 g/cm (dry), 1865 g/cm (wet). While the adhesion of the finish of suede leather with aniline dye was 1720 g/cm (dry) and 1010 g/cm (wet) respectively. The suede leather with pigment and aniline colour resistance to dry and wet rubbin...|$|R
40|$|The Tibetan singing bowl {{is a type}} of {{standing}} bell. Originating from Himalayan fire cults as early as the 5 th century BC, they have since been used in religious ceremonies, for shamanic journeying, exor-cism, meditation and shakra adjustment. A singing bowl is played by striking or rubbing its rim with a wooden or leather-wrapped mallet. The sides and rim of the bowl then vibrate to produce a rich sound. When the bowl is filled with water, this excitation can cause crispa-tion of the water surface that can be followed by more complicated surface wave patterns and ultimately the creation of droplets. We here demonstrate the means by which the Tibetan singing bowl can levi-tate droplets. This is a sample arXiv article illustrating the use of fluid dynamics videos. The first part of the video shows a water-filled Tibetan bowl <b>rubbed</b> by a <b>leather</b> mallet that excites vibrations via a ‚Äùstick-slip ‚Äù process. The rim deflection indicates that the main deformation mode is the fundamental one associated with four nodes and four anti-nodes along the rim. We proceed by reporting the form of the flow induced by the moving rim, specifically, the evolution of the free surface with increasing rim forcing. The bowl is completely filled with water, and its fundamental deforma-tion mode excited acoustically. A loudspeaker produces a sinusoidal sound at a frequency f 0 = 188 Hz that corresponds to the fundamental frequency excited by rubbing the rim. 1 a...|$|R
6000|$|So {{one great}} lump of the servant's toil will {{practically}} disappear. Two others are already disappearing. In many houses {{there are still}} the offensive duties of filling lamps and blacking boots to be done. Our coming house, however, will have no lamps to need filling, and, as for the boots, really intelligent people will feel the essential ugliness of wearing the evidence of constant manual toil upon their persons. They will wear sorts of shoes and boots that can be cleaned by wiping in a minute or so. Take now the bedroom work. The lack of ingenuity in sanitary fittings at present forbids the obvious convenience of hot and cold water supply to the bedroom, {{and there is a}} mighty fetching and carrying of water and slops to be got through daily. All that will cease. Every bedroom will have its own bath-dressing room which any well-bred person will be intelligent and considerate enough to use and leave without the slightest disarrangement. This, so far as [...] "upstairs" [...] goes, really only leaves bedmaking to be done, and a bed does not take five minutes to make. Downstairs a vast amount of needless labour at present arises out of table wear. [...] "Washing up" [...] consists of a tedious cleansing and wiping of each table utensil in turn, whereas {{it should be possible to}} immerse all dirty table wear in a suitable solvent for a few minutes and then run that off for the articles to dry. The application of solvents to window cleaning, also, would be a possible thing but for the primitive construction of our windows, which prevents anything but a painful rub, rub, <b>rub,</b> with the <b>leather.</b> A friend of mine in domestic service tells me that this rubbing is to get the window dry, and this seems to be the general impression, but I think it incorrect. The water is not an adequate solvent, and enough cannot be used under existing conditions. Consequently, if the window is cleaned and left wet, it dries in drops, and these drops contain dirt in solution which remain as spots. But water containing a suitable solvent could quite simply be made to run down a window for a few minutes from pinholes in a pipe above into a groove below, and this could be followed by pure rain water for an equal time, and in this way the whole window cleaning in the house could, I imagine, be reduced to the business of turning on a tap.|$|R
40|$|This is {{the first}} piece that has been created {{as part of a}} wider on going {{practice}} based research project entitled ‚ÄúCan an artefact be created to store the memory of lost love‚Äù. The study hypothetically defines what love is in the context of differing relationships, such as familial, platonic and romantic the explanation of ‚Äòlost love‚Äô is to be explored as this changes the status and emotion felt. Lost love {{for the purpose of this}} study is defined as love felt for a person who is estranged from another, no longer in contact with or passed away from the participant. The reasoning behind using lost love as the starting point is considered here. ‚ÄúLost or dead loves, enshrined in an aura of imaginary perfection, seem to hover over all our loves‚Ä¶within the imagination, they take on a magical and healing power. We idealise their attributes, make them the bearers of all our good and wholeness, the healers of our wounds‚Äù (Appignanesi, 2011, p. 36). The study will capture a number of participants lost love narratives, which will then be translated in to the design of storage artefacts. These narratives of lost love portray heightened emotion; therefore creating the belief that this lost love can be transubstantiated and harnessed within an object. The chest is an area of the body synonymous with love. Our heart, being the symbol of love is encased here, our neck being a sensual area on display or waiting to be kissed. The N-exlace is an accessory or the means to ‚Äòstore‚Äô the love of a lost relationship. The natural veg tanned leather is moulded tightly to the curves and undulations of the body to allow a seamless fit as if the leather was the skin from earlier years. Imprinted on the leather are memories of the relationship, both good and bad. Images from happier times in photo booths, playfully pulling faces, letters and postcards received talking about the future and that pain of being apart and diary excerpts as the relationship broke down, knowing it was nearly over, but not sure where to turn or what to do. In the centre of piece is a bubble. The ghost of an object symbolizing the embodiment of the lost love. A locket once given as a gift. Like the love, the locket no longer remains, but the imprint on the person is still present, leaving memories that shape our character, lifestyle and fashion choices and in certain aspects our future relationships. The Design Process This is a personal piece, rather than creating from collected narratives. Therefore the locket, letters, photographs and diary entries are all my own. The design process started with collecting these souvenirs from a previous relationship or ‚Äòlost love‚Äô and experimenting with how the objects could be applied to create a new fashion artefact. Casting with translucent silicone is a predominant part of my work as it allows the detail of objects to be captured clearly and viewed as if they were still present. I like to re-imagine objects as being absent from their original location, but leaving a lasting impression in the space they once possessed. The locket here felt as if it should still be part of the skin and so I chose to embed it into the leather. Like tattoos, the memories from the relationship are captured on the leather/skin and remind the wearer about the relationship, both happy and sad times. The design and making process allowed me to rethink the ending of the relationship and acted as a therapeutic cathartic exercise remembering why choices were made, but how they have shaped who I have become. Making Process The leather was decorated with old photographs and excerpts by using acetone printing, where by a reverse image is placed face down on the leather, then acetone is painted on and rubbed through to create the print. This gives a distressed finish depending on how hard or regular the paper is <b>rubbed.</b> Traditional <b>leather</b> craft technique of wet moulding natural vegetable tanned leather to form the shape of the piece. It is then left to dry and set into place. The leather is finished using traditional edge burnishing techniques and carnauba cr√®me wax finishing. The locket was cast using a platinum cure silicone and a spherical mould. The locket was suspended just on the surface of the silicone to give the front half impression. The bezel of the locket remains as an idea of what once was there. The silicone mould was then secured in place by sandwiching between the leather and secured using silicone glue. Using rivets and a buckle and strap to keep the piece in place around the neck finishes the piece...|$|R
