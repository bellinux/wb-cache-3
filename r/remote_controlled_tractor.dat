25|$|Radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> (RF <b>remote</b> <b>control)</b> is used {{to control}} distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> the radio <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most <b>remote</b> <b>controls</b> use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> duplicator because it is able to copy existing <b>remote</b> <b>controls,</b> while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> in the market.|$|R
