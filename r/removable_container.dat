50|$|A CBS system {{includes}} a toilet (usually portable) with a <b>removable</b> <b>container</b> which is routinely exchanged for an empty container {{when it is}} full. The toilet design, which may incorporate the use of chemicals and a biodegradable plastic film, {{in the case of}} Loowatt, eliminates human contact with faeces and reduces odor and insects. All infrastructure associated with a CBS system is typically situated above ground, thereby reducing both construction costs  and vulnerability to flooding. Excreta-filled containers are sealed and transported to a designated disposal or composting site. Water needs are limited to the amount required for anal cleansing and hand washing.|$|E

This project is about designing and fabricating the <b>Removable</b> <b>Container</b> Trolley {{that can be used to}} helps people transporting load items more efficiently. The main objective in this project is to design a <b>Removable</b> <b>Container</b> Trolley. This project involves the process of designing the trolley by considering the shape. functionality. portability and the manufacturing cost for people to use it. The material of this design is easy to gain it. because it only using rectangular hollow steel and circular hollow steel. So that the method joining that can be compatible in assembled this trolley is welding processes. In assembled the wheel. fastening method is the best chosen because it's only use bolt and nut to bind the wheel with the base of this trolley. This project also required analysis to make sure the strength of the product to ensure the safety for the user indeed of publishing. After all the process had been done. this trolley may help us to understand the fabrication and designing process that involved in this project...|$|E

25|$|Container-based {{sanitation}} (CBS) {{refers to}} a sanitation system where human excreta is collected in sealable, <b>removable</b> <b>containers</b> (or cartridges) that are transported to treatment facilities. Container-based sanitation is usually provided as a service involving provision of certain types of portable toilets, and collection of excreta at a cost borne by the users. With suitable development, support and functioning partnerships, CBS {{can be used to}} provide low-income urban populations with safe collection, transport and treatment of excrement at a lower cost than installing and maintaining sewers. In most cases, CBS is based on the use of urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|R
50|$|In {{cases where}} the blades are <b>removable,</b> the <b>{{container}}</b> should have an o-ring or gasket between {{the body of the}} container and the base to seal the container and prevent the contents from leaking.

2500|$|There {{are several}} types of UDDTs: the single vault type which has only one feces vault; the double vault type which has two feces vaults that are used alternately; and the mobile or {{portable}} UDDTs which are {{a variation of the}} single vault type and are commercially manufactured or homemade from simple materials. A UDDT can be configured as a sitting toilet (with a urine diversion pedestal or bench) or as a squatting toilet (with a urine diversion squatting pan). The most important design elements of the UDDT are: source separation of urine and feces; waterless operation; and ventilated vaults (also called [...] "chambers") or <b>removable</b> <b>containers</b> for feces storage and treatment. If anal cleansing takes place with water (i.e., the users are [...] "washers" [...] rather than [...] "wipers"), then this anal cleansing water must be drained separately and not be allowed to enter the feces vault.|$|R
50|$|A Roll-off has a hoist and subframe, but no body, {{it carries}} <b>removable</b> <b>{{container}}s.</b> The container is loaded on the ground, then pulled {{onto the back}} of the truck with a winch and cable. The truck goes to the dump site, after it has been dumped the empty container is taken and placed to be loaded or stored. The hoist is raised and the container slides down the subframe so the rear is on the ground. The container has rollers on the rear and can be moved forward or back until the front of it is lowered onto the ground. The containers are usually open-topped boxes used for rubble and building debris, but rubbish compactor containers are also carried. A newer hook-lift system (“roller container” in the UK) does the same job, but lifts, lowers, and dumps the container with a boom arrangement instead of a cable and hoist.|$|R

5000|$|The shelter may cover very {{different}} sorts of toilets. A common {{one is the}} pit latrine or pit toilet, which collects human feces in {{a hole in the}} ground. When properly built and maintained they can decrease the spread of disease by reducing the amount of human feces in the environment from open defecation. [...] When the pit fills to within 0.5 meters (1.6 feet) of the top, it should be either emptied or a new pit constructed and the shelter moved or re-built at the new location. The management of the fecal sludge removed from the pit is complicated. There are both environment and health risks if not done properly. As of 2013 pit latrines are used by an estimated 1.77 billion people. This is mostly in the developing world as well as in rural and wilderness areas.Another system is the bucket toilet, consisting of a seat and a portable receptacle (bucket or pail).

40|$|Both the United States (US) and Russia have {{conducted}} {{a variety of}} space environment effects on materials (SEEM) flight experiments in recent years. A prime US example was the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), which spent 5 years and 9 months in low Earth orbit (LEO) from April 1984 to January 1990. A key Russian experiment was the <b>Removable</b> Cassette <b>Container</b> experiment, (RCC- 1), flown on the Mir Orbital Station from 11 January 1990 to 26 April 1991. This paper evaluates the thermal control coating materials data generated by these two missions by comparing: environmental exposure conditions, functionality and chemistry of thermal control coating materials, and pre- and post-flight analysis of absorptance, emittance, and mass loss due to atomic oxygen erosion. It will be seen that there are noticeable differences in the US and Russian space environment measurements and models, which complicates comparisons of environments. The results of both flight experiments confirm that zinc oxide and zinc oxide orthotitanate white thermal control paints in metasilicate binders (Z 93, YB 71, TP-co- 2, TP-co- 11, and TP-co- 12), are the most stable upon exposure to the space environment.

5000|$|These {{fuel tanks}} {{consisted}} of eighteen <b>removable</b> rubberized-compound <b>containers,</b> called cells, installed inside the main {{wings of the}} airplane, nine to each side. The main wings of the B-17 consisted of an [...] "inboard wing" [...] structural panel mounted to the fuselage and mounting the engines and flaps, and an [...] "outboard wing" [...] structural panel joined to the inboard wing and carrying only the ailerons. The Tokyo tanks were installed {{on either side of}} the joint (a load-bearing point) where the two wing portions were connected. Five cells, totalling 270 gal capacity, sat side by side in the outboard wing and were joined by a fuel line to the main tank delivering fuel to the outermost engine. The sixth cell was located in the space where the wing sections joined, with the remaining three cells located side-by-side within the inboard wing, and these four cells delivered 270 gal of fuel to the feeder tank for the inboard engine. The same arrangement was repeated on the opposite wing. The Tokyo tanks added 1,080 gal of fuel to the 1,700 gal carried in the six regular wing tanks and the 820 gal that could be carried in a tank that could be mounted in the bomb bay, for a combined total of 3,600 gal.|$|R
50|$|The fourth EVA of Volkov's {{career was}} during Expedition 46, with veteran {{cosmonaut}} Yuri Malenchenko. The spacewalkers performed {{works with the}} experiment Test at two locations: they took away samples from the outer surface of the docking compartment Pirs hatch and {{in the area of}} the cover window #8 at the service module Zvezda. The goal of the experiments was to develop methods for detecting leaks and control of elements of the exterior surface of the ISS.The cosmonauts also dismantled a monoblock responsible for exposing samples of organic and biological materials in open space (experiment Expose-R) and set the unit samples #2 from an experiment for the study of space influence on the mechanical properties of materials. At the same module, they had to replace a <b>removable</b> cassette <b>container,</b> where the samples are placed on the exterior of stations in conditions of prolonged exposure, change the orientation of the pressure control unit on the module Poisk.One of the important tasks were works on an experiment with the goal to develop technologies for sticking film thermal control coating, secure package screen-vacuum thermal insulation on the surface to be repaired and transactions that require bonding film materials in space flight.For more convenient travel on the outer surface of the ISS the spacewalkers installed handrails on the soft part of the conical device of the Functional Cargo Block Zarya. Upon completion of the main tasks, the cosmonauts started a photo documentation of the external surface of the ISS Russian segment. The spacewalk concluded after 4 hours 45 minutes.|$|R
40|$|A DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) {{instrument}} was implemented and operated onboard a long-distance passenger aircraft {{within the framework}} of the CARIBIC project (Civil Aircraft for the Regular Investigation of the atmosphere Based on an Instrument Container). The {{instrument was}} designed to keep weight, size and power consumption low and to comply with civil aviation regulations. It records spectra of scattered light from three viewing directions (nadir, 10 &deg; above and below horizon) using a miniaturized telescope system. The telescopes are integrated in the main pylon of the inlet system which is mounted at the belly of the aircraft. Fibre bundles transmit light from the telescopes to spectrograph-detector units inside the DOAS container instrument. The latter is part of the <b>removable</b> CARIBIC instrument <b>container,</b> which is installed monthly on the aircraft for a series of measurement flights. During 30 flight operations within three years, measurements of HCHO, HONO, NO 2 , BrO, O 3 and the oxygen dimer O 4 were conducted. All of these trace gases except BrO could be analysed with a 30 s time resolution. HONO was detected for the first time in a deep convective cloud over central Asia, while BrO, NO 2 and O 3 could be observed in tropopause fold regions. Biomass burning signatures over South America could be seen and measurements during ascent and descent provided information on boundary layer trace gas profiles (e. g. NO 2 or HCHO) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{microenvironment}} of the turfgrass rhizotron {{located at}} UNARDC near Mead was investigated. The rhizotron facility has two observation rooms, each containing 20 <b>removable</b> root cell <b>containers.</b> Root cell container variation, rhizotron observation room {{vertical and horizontal}} temperature gradients, soil temperature profile of the root cell containers versus the adjacent soil, vertical and horizontal temperature gradients within root cell containers, and root cell container media were investigated in the facility. ^ A complete randomized design was used due to a low coefficient of variation between root cell containers of 0. 58. The rhizotron observation room without circulation had a mean vertical gradient of 1. 1 C in a diurnal cycle. With air circulation the mean vertical temperature gradient was reduced to 0. 3 C. Horizontal temperature differences in the observation room had {{a standard deviation of}} 0. 13. Daily mean temperatures in the observation room ranged from 0. 1 to 16. 3 C warmer than ambient temperature. ^ Soil temperatures were assessed with thermocouples placed at five levels (i. e. vertical gradient) and three positions per level (i. e. horizontal gradient) in each root cell container. Mean temperature for horizontal gradient had no biological significance at the 25, 300, 600, and 1200 mm level. The 5 mm level had horizontal differences of 2. 1 C with biological significance. Soil temperatures in the root cell containers differed from the adjacent soil. Containers had higher temperatures at the 300, 600, and 1200 mm levels than the soil profile due to the observation room influence. Insulation of the root cell container reduced the observation room influence. ^ Silica sand; fritted clay; washed, river-sand; and sand/soil media had different soil temperature profiles. Fritted clay had the lowest temperatures at the 5 and 25 mm levels for the media tested. Media influence on soil temperature declined with depth. ^ Turfgrass growing in fritted clay had the greatest root length in the upper portion of the profile, but sand/soil mix had the greatest total root length. The fritted clay was the best medium with superior topgrowth, lower temperatures, acceptable root growth, lowest bulk density, and ease of handling. ...|$|R
40|$|The United States Department of Energy (DOE) has {{published}} a standard that specifies the criteria for preparation and packaging of plutonium metals and oxides for safe long-term storage (DOE-STD- 3013 - 96). This standard is followed for the packaging of materials resulting from the disassembly of nuclear weapons at Los Alamos National Laboratory under the Advanced Retirement and Integrated Extraction System (ARIES) project. Declassified plutonium metal or oxide material from the ARES project is packaged into doubly contained and welded type 304 L stainless steel containers that comply with the DOE standard. The 3013 - 96 standard describes requirements for maximum contamination limits on the outer surface of the sealed inner container. These limits are 500 dpm per 100 cm 2 for direct measurements and 20 dpm per 100 cm 2 for <b>removable</b> contamination. For <b>containers</b> filled, welded, and handled inside a highly contaminated glovebox line, these limits are difficult to obtain. Simple handling within the line is demonstrated to contaminate surfaces from 10, 000 to 10, 000, 000 dpm alpha per 100 cm 2. To routinely achieve contamination levels below the maximum contamination levels specified by the 3013 - 96 standard within a processing operation, a decontamination step must be included. In the ARIES line, this decontamination step is an electrolytic process that produces a controlled uniform etch of the container surfaces. Decontamination of the 3013 - 96 compliant ARIES inner container is well demonstrated. Within 30 to 50 minutes electrolysis time, tixed contamination is reduced to hundreds of dpm generally occurring only at electrode contact points and welds. Removable contamination is routinely brought to non-detectable levels. The total process time for the cycle (includes electrolysis, rinse, and dry stages) is {{on the order of}} 1. 5 to 2 hours per container. The ARIES inner container decontamination system highly automated and consists of a plumbing loop, electronic controls and process monitors, and a decontamination chamber or "fixture". The tixture is situated like an air lock between a contaminated and an uncontaminated section of a processing glovebox. The welded and leak tested container is placed into the fixture through a door on the contaminated side and the electrolysis process is run, including rinse and dry cycles. The container is then removed through a second door into the uncontaminated side where it is monitored for surface alpha contamination, leak checked, and reweighed...|$|R
