25|$|Ladder Companies are {{generally}} equipped with Seagrave aerials. Ladder length varies and often {{depends on the}} geographic area to which the unit is assigned. Those in the older sections of the city often use tiller trucks to allow for greater maneuverability. Before Seagrave was the predominant builder, Mack CF's built with Baker tower ladders were popular. Most FDNY aerials are built with 75’, 95' or 100' ladders. Tiller ladders, <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> ladders and mid-mount tower ladders are the types of trucks used. In 2010, The FDNY chose Ferrara over Pierce, and E-One for a new contract that issued for 10–100' rear-mount ladder trucks, using a chassis and stainless steel cab custom-designed to FDNY specifications. Delivery {{of the first of}} these new trucks is anticipated in the 1st quarter of 2011.|$|E

The construction is plastic although the lens' <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> is metal. The distance meter is recessed inside a window, but no {{depth of field}} meter or infrared index is present. The 7/8" [...] zoom ring is made of raised rubber ridges and operates over a 75 degree turning radius. The focus ring is similarly constructed with more closely spaced ridges and a 100 degrees of turning action. The ridges of both rings are parallel to the lens.|$|E
500|$|Her main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} three pairs of [...] Obukhov Model 1886 35-calibre guns mounted in two twin barbette mounts side by side forward and one aft of the superstructure. They had a maximum elevation of 15° and could depress to −2°. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across the bow and 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> could traverse 202°. Their rate of fire was one round every four minutes, fifty seconds, including training time. They fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] {{to a range of}} [...] at maximum elevation.

500|$|The British {{attack was}} {{interrupted}} due to reports of U-boats {{ahead of the}} British ships. Beatty quickly ordered evasive maneuvers, which allowed the German ships to increase the distance from their pursuers. At this time, Lions last operational dynamo failed, which reduced her speed to [...] Beatty, in the stricken Lion, ordered the remaining battlecruisers to [...] "Engage the enemy's rear", but signal confusion caused the ships to target Blücher alone. She continued to resist stubbornly; Blücher repulsed attacks by the four cruisers of the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron and four destroyers. However, the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron flagship, Aurora, hit Blücher twice with torpedoes. By this time, every main battery gun turret except the <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> had been silenced. A volley of seven more torpedoes was launched at point-blank range; these hits caused the ship to capsize at 13:13. In {{the course of the}} engagement, Blücher had been hit by 70–100large-caliber shells and several torpedoes.|$|E
500|$|She {{differed}} from her sisters {{mainly in the}} design of her gun mounts. Sinop had six [...] Obukhov Model 1877 30-caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts, two forward, side by side, and one aft. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across the bow and 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> could traverse 202°. Their rate of fire was one round every four minutes, thirty-five seconds, including training time. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only [...] ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. The seven [...] Model 1877 35-caliber guns were mounted on broadside pivot mounts in hull embrasures, except for one gun mounted in the stern in the hull. Six of the eight [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in small sponsons that projected from the hull with the aftermost pair mounted in hull embrasures to defend the ship against torpedo boats. Four [...] five-barreled revolving Hotchkiss guns were mounted in the fighting top. She carried seven above-water [...] torpedo tubes, one tube forward on each side, able to bear on forward targets, two other tubes were mounted on each broadside fore and aft of the central citadel; the seventh tube was in the stern.|$|E
500|$|She {{differed}} from her sister ships mainly in her main armament. She had six [...] Model 1886 35-caliber guns mounted in twin barbette mounts, two forward, side by side, and one aft. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across {{the bow and}} 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> could traverse 202°. They had a range of elevation from −2° to +15°. Chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns {{as far as they}} could go to one side produced a list of 7.6° and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position. This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list, but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill. The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance, but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed too expensive or inadequate. Their rate of fire was reportedly one round every fifteen to seventeen minutes, including training time. Sixty rounds per gun were carried. The main guns were mounted very low, (only [...] ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. They fired a 'light' shell that weighed [...] or a 'heavy' shell that weighed [...] The 'light' shell had a muzzle velocity of [...] while the 'heavy' shell could only be propelled at a velocity of [...] The 'light' shell had a maximum range of [...] when fired at an elevation of 15°.|$|E

500|$|The main {{armament}} of the Ekaterina II-class ships {{consisted of}} three pairs of [...] guns mounted in twin-gun barbettes. In an arrangement very unusual for such large guns, two barbettes were placed forward side-by-side, while the third barbette was aft of the superstructure. Each of the forward mounts could traverse 30° across the bow and 35° abaft the beam, or a total of 155°. The <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> could traverse 202°. The main guns were mounted very low, (only [...] ) above the main deck, and caused extensive damage to the deck when fired over the bow or stern. Two different guns were used; Ekaterina II and Sinop had 30-caliber Pattern 1877 guns while Chesma and Georgii Pobedonosets had 35-caliber Obukhov Pattern 1886 guns. Both guns had elevation limits of −2° to +15°. Their rate of fire was about one round every four to five minutes, including training time, and 60 rounds per gun were carried. Each ship had {{a different type of}} mount inside the barbette; Ekaterina II used bulky, hydraulically powered Moncrieff disappearing gun mounts which proved to be larger than estimated and the outer edges of the armored redoubt had to be carried out over the ships' sides on sponsons on the first two ships completed, Ekaterina II and Chesma, although Chesmas guns were not disappearing. By the time that Sinop and Georgii Pobedonosets were finished the gun mount had been reduced in size enough that the sponsons could be eliminated. But the new and smaller redoubt proved to be too small for the 12-inch 35-caliber gun and Sinop had to use the older 30-caliber weapon. In contrast the Georgii Pobedonosetss redoubt was designed to use the newer gun. Chesmas guns were mounted on unbalanced turntables and they caused her to list when the guns were trained to one side. Traversing all the guns as far as they could go to one side produced a list of 7.6° and made it very difficult for the turntable machinery to rotate the guns back to the fore-and-aft position. This problem had been anticipated and water tanks had been added to counteract the list, but they proved to be virtually useless because they took up to two hours to fill. The problem was partially cured in 1892 when the equipment was rearranged on the turntable to improve their balance, but more thorough solutions to the problem were either deemed to expensive or inadequate.|$|E
2500|$|Two single [...] {{guns were}} carried in open pivot mounts as the ship's main armament. Each gun had a {{magazine}} with {{a capacity of}} two hundred rounds underneath it, although only {{the one on the}} forecastle had a hoist. The ammunition for the <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> had to be hand-carried. Three single Vickers 2 pounder pom-poms and three [...] machine guns were intended as the anti-aircraft armament, but deteriorating relations with the United Kingdom prevented the Soviets from buying any of these weapons. Most ships completed without any AA guns as the Soviets needed some time to develop their own equivalent AA guns.|$|E
2500|$|Early in {{the life}} of the Viscount {{aircraft}} type, renewal of the inner lower booms included installation of new mount fittings for attachment of the rear of the two inboard engine nacelles to the lower booms. [...] New fittings were supplied without pre-drilled holes and the holes were drilled during installation to correctly align the engine nacelle with the wing. However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> fittings. Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms. [...] When new inner lower booms were installed in VH-RMQ in 1958, new engine nacelle <b>rear</b> <b>mount</b> fittings were also installed but when new booms were again installed in 1964 the fittings first installed in 1958 were re-used. [...] In the wreckage of the right wing of VH-RMQ there was evidence of an initial problem while trying to align the five holes in the old fitting with the bushes in the new boom. The bores of three bushes had been scored with a drill, possibly while maintenance personnel were trying to align three of the holes sufficiently to be able to insert the attachment bolts. Running a drill through the bush at Station 143 may have disturbed the bush and initiated a sequence of actions leading to fatal damage to the wall of the hole.|$|E
