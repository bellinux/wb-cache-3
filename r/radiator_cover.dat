Casey is named the most improved for {{coming out of his}} shell in the episode (despite Dez doing a better job overall) while Joe is named the worst (on Jo's insistence; Geoff had tried to name Charmaine for failing more challenges).

50|$|In 1931 Scania-Vabis {{presented}} a larger {{version of its}} standard truck, called the 335. The truck had a payload capacity of 4 to 5 tonnes and was sold with a six-cylinder engine in petrol or Hesselman version. In 1936 the truck was modernized with a more streamlined front with a slightly sloping <b>radiator</b> <b>cover.</b> More importantly the engine and cab was moved forward so that the engine was mounted above the front axle. This meant increased payload capacity with a longer loading platform and a better distribution of axle loads. From 1936 onwards the truck was offered with Scania-Vabis’ first pre-chamber diesel engine.|$|E
40|$|Low {{pressure}} {{hot water}} radiators {{are the most}} popular type of heat emitter used in UK buildings. Because of high surface temperatures, or for aesthetic reasons, radiators are often encased in some form of architectural casing which reduces their output. An alternative method of reducing surface touch temperature and enhancing the appearance of radiators may be achieved by using decorative covers. This research examines how the heat output from a radiator is affected by the application of an innovative magnetic decorative <b>cover</b> to the <b>radiator</b> surface. A series of tests was run which compared the heat output from a bare radiator, to the output when the radiator is installed (a) under a magnetic cover, and (b) within a traditional wooden cover. Since the heat output from a radiator is by convection and radiation, thermocouples were located on radiator and supporting wall surfaces, {{as well as in the}} air spaces around the radiator. By this means the temperature differences which drive both heat transfer mechanisms could be determined. Additionally, temperatures were also monitored by a thermal imaging camera. The scenario tests were carried out under steady state conditions at closed room space, with controlled room temperature. Results from the tests showed that magnetically applied <b>radiator</b> <b>covers</b> efficiency increased by 13 - 20 % relative to traditional <b>radiator</b> wooden <b>cover.</b> In terms of space-heating, this can reduce energy input needed to achieve comfort temperature. This demonstrates that magnetic <b>radiator</b> <b>covers</b> can offer improved heating system energy performance. Keywords: Convection, radiator, radiation, radwraps, heat transfer, wooden cover.

50|$|The second generation, which {{replaced}} {{the first generation}} in the mid-1990s, {{is equipped with a}} four-speed automatic transmission, power steering and bears serial numbers 39XX ~ 5XXX. The following additional changes were made compared to the first generation: switch to the chassis of the Toyota High Mobility Vehicle. It has full-time four wheel drive with a center differential, and the cab is equipped with air conditioning and radio.In comparison to the first generation, the front bumper shape was changed and the shape of the tail light as well as the style of the round front lights, to make the Toyota truck look similar to the High Mobility Vehicle. It uses the same wheels and tires as the High Mobility Vehicle. One of the identifying marks is the cutout for the back wheels. Compared to the High Mobility Vehicle the wheelbase has been shortened with good maneuverability for the cab-over shape. It does not feature four wheel steering. In addition, the radiator was lowered and the position and shape of the front <b>radiator</b> <b>cover</b> has been changed.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the vehicle cooling system strongly depends on the air flow through the radiator core. The flow through the radiator core in turn depends on other panels {{that are in the}} vicinity of the radiator and these include the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover,</b> grille, front inner panel, cowl, floor, etc. A clear understanding of the flow pattern inside the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover</b> is essential for optimizing the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover</b> shape to increase the flow through the radiator core, thereby increasing the thermal {{efficiency of}} the radiator. In this paper, CFD enabled optimization of airflow distribution inside the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover</b> is discussed. Starting from a CFD solution of the baseline design that was validated against indoor test data, a series of optimization cases were executed to arrive at the optimum configuration of the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover.</b> The airflow distribution inside the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover</b> and the flow through the radiator core was monitored to provide a quantitative basis for the optimization process. The CFD analysis was conducted using the commercial software FLUENT™, while the surface and volume mesh were generated using ANSA ™ and TGRID™, respectively. Use of ANSA ™ for surface meshing was instrumental in reducing the CFD cycle time. CFD analysis of the baseline design that was validated against test data showed that significant regions of re-circulating flow existed inside the <b>radiator</b> <b>cover.</b> This recirculation reduced the flow through the radiator core, leading to a build-up of hot air pockets close to the radiator surface and subsequent degradation of radiator thermal efficiency. The CFD enabled optimization led to <b>radiator</b> <b>cover</b> configuration that eliminated these recirculation regions and increased the flow through the radiator core by 34 %. It is anticipated that this increase in radiator core flow would significantly increase the radiator thermal efficiency...|$|E
