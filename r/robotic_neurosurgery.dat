40|$|Neurosurgery {{requires}} a great precision in tool positioning. Nevertheless, neurosurgeons, limited by their anthropomorphic structure, have a reduced dexterity when moving a surgical tool. The requirements of having both a magnification of the operative field and a tool miniaturization have overwhelmed the spatial {{resolution of the}} human hand. Robots, in contrast, are capable of minute, tremor-filtered movements and are indefatigable. These assets are invaluable in any microsurgical arena, particularly when manipulating delicate and diseased intracranial structures.

40|$|Purpose For the {{application}} of less invasive <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> to the resection of deep-seated tumors, a prototype system of a force-detecting gripper with a flexible micromanipulator and force feedback to the operating unit will be developed. Methods Gripping force applied on the gripper is detected by strain gauges attached to the gripper clip. The signal is transmitted to the amplifier by wires running through the inner tube of the manipulator. Proportional force is applied on the finger lever of the operating unit by the surgeon using a bilateral control program. A pulling force experienced by the gripper is also detected at the gripper clip. The signal for the pulling force is transmitted in a manner identical to that mentioned previously, and the proportional torque is applied on the touching roller of the finger lever of the operating unit. The surgeon can feel the gripping force as {{the resistance of the}} operating force of the finger and can feel the pulling force as the friction at the finger surface. Results A basic operation test showed that both the gripping force and pulling force were clearly detected in the gripping of soft material and that the operator could feel the gripping force and pulling force at the finger lever of the operating unit. Conclusions A prototype of the force feedback in the microgripping manipulator system has been developed. The system will be useful for removing deep-seated brain tumors in future master-slave-type <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> © 2013 CARS...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Computer Integrated Surgery {{has only}} existed for two decades, however {{it has already}} spread out world wide, with well over 100. 000 {{operations}} performed. In the near fu-ture, newly developed robotic systems may conquer even the most challenging fields—such as neurosurgery—to provide better patient care and medical outcome. This paper presents the major systems and different strategies applied in <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> Besides appropriate design, adequate control strategies are required to ensure maximal safety. This makes automated neurosurgery a technologically challenging area for researchers. It is also important during the design phase to consider market aspects. We anticipate that the future trends of clinical applications are outlined by the current leading research directions. The conclusions of the past years of inno-vation will lead forward {{on the path of}} further improvement...|$|E

40|$|The European project ACTIVE aims at {{developing}} an integrated redundant <b>robotic</b> platform for <b>neurosurgery.</b> During tele-operation, the surgeon perceives on a haptic device {{the interaction of}} the tool with the brain tissue by means of a force/torque sensor mounted on the slave. Moreover, active constraints prevent damage to eloquent areas and assist the surgeon by constraining and directing his motions. Having two sources of haptic feedback, and only one haptic device through which it can be displayed makes it difficult to distinguish between the two sources. In this extended abstract, we formalize the problem and propose a solution based on vibratory feedback. The platform that we’ve set up in order to take our findings from virtual reality to teleoperation is described, as well as the current work we’re performing in order to cover not only forbidden region active constraints, but also guidance forces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a review about <b>neurosurgery,</b> <b>robotic</b> assistants {{in this type}} of procedure, and the approach to the problem of brain tissue displacement, including techniques for obtaining medical images. It is especially focused on the phenomenon of brain displacement, commonly known as brain shift, which causes a loss of reference between the preoperative images and the volumes to be treated during image-guided surgery. Hypothetically, with brain shift prediction and correction for the neuronavigation system, minimal invasion trajectories could be planned and shortened. This would reduce damage to functional tissues and possibly lower the morbidity and mortality in delicate and demanding medical procedures such as the removal of a brain tumor. This paper also mentions other issues associated with neurosurgery and shows the way robotized systems have helped solve these problems. Finally, it highlights the future perspectives of neurosurgery, a branch of medicine that seeks to treat the ailments of the main organ of the human body from the perspective of many disciplines...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Development and {{evaluation}} of an effective attachment device for a bilateral brain tumor resection robotic surgery system based on the sensory performance of the human index finger in order to precisely detect gripping- and pulling-force feedback. Methods: First, a basic test was conducted to investigate {{the performance of the}} human index finger in the gripping- and pulling-force feedback system. Based on the test result, a new finger-attachment device was designed and constructed. Then, discrimination tests were conducted to assess the pulling force and the feedback on the hardness of the gripped material. Results: The results of the basic test show the application of pulling force on the side surface of the finger has an advantage to distinguish the pulling force when the gripping force is applied on the finger-touching surface. Based on this result, a finger-attachment device that applies a gripping force on the finger surface and pulling force on the side surface of the finger was developed. By conducting a discrimination test to assess the hardness of the gripped material, an operator can distinguish whether the gripped material is harder or softer than a normal brain tissue. This will help in confirming whether the gripped material is a tumor. By conducting a discrimination test to assess the pulling force, an operator can distinguish the pulling-force resistance when attempting to pull off the soft material. Pulling-force feedback may help avoid the breaking of blood pipes when they are trapped in the gripper or attached to the gripped tissue. Conclusion: The finger-attachment device that was developed for detecting gripping- and pulling-force feedback may {{play an important role in}} the development of future <b>neurosurgery</b> <b>robotic</b> systems for precise and safe resection of brain tumors. © 2017 CARSin Press / Embargo Period 12 month...|$|R
40|$|Concentric tube robot (CTR) {{comprises}} several precurved concentric tubes {{which can}} rotate and translate independently {{with respect to}} each other. Each pre-curved tube of a CTR can be controlled to rotate axially and translate along its axis, which enables the tip to bypass obstacles and finally reach the target position. The concentric tube robots enable surgeons to perform delicate procedures by combining the flexibility of elastic catheters {{with the use of}} operation tools, such as needles, forceps and grippers. Hence, many clinical applications of concentric tube robots are promising, such as transnasal <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery.</b> Concentric tube robots are suitable for such minimally invasive surgeries because they are able to present various flexible shapes with great dexterity, which strengthens the ability of collision avoidance and enlarges the reachability of operation tools. This paper describes an image based visual servoing method to control the concentric tube robot so that it can reach a desired position. A model-less control algorithm is developed by first estimating and adjusting the Jacobian matrix based on measurement of each incremental movement traced by a single camera, and then generating the next motion using the estimated Jacobian matrix. Therefore, no kinematic model is required to control the CTR during experiments and the experimental results reveal the feasibility and accuracy of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that realizes model-less feedback control of concentric tube robots based on visual servoing...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 06 Surgical robots {{have been}} widely used to assist {{surgeons}} to carry out dexterous surgical procedures via various ways. Robotically assisted surgery allows surgeons to overcome the limitations in the minimally invasive surgery and thus to enhance the surgical performance. Most of the robotically assisted surgery require surgeon’s operation directly or indirectly via a teleoperation station. A certain level of autonomy in robotic surgery could not only free the surgeon from some tedious and repetitive tasks, but also utilize the advantages of the robot: high dexterity and accuracy. This work considers the image-guided <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery,</b> aiming to semi-automate a neurosurgical procedure for clean up the tumor residues after manual removal of the brain tumor using a surgical robot, where the manual operation is a tedious and time-consuming task for surgeons due to long time integration of the fluorescent signal. The entire medical procedure is modeled using behavior tree framework, and encoded and tested on RAVEN TM II surgical robotic platform using a simulated brain phantom. Furthermore, a path planner is developed that automatically synthesize different ablation path plans to cover the entire tumorous regions. At the current stage, the path planner is able to generate three types of path patterns for the surgeon to choose the most reliable plan before robotic execution. Along with the generated path plans, other computed metrics such as the total number of the via-points in each plan, estimated time for the robotic execution, will also be delivered to the surgeon for reference...|$|E
40|$|The {{detection}} of tissue interface (e. g., normal tissue, cancer, tumor) {{has been limited}} clinically to tactile feedback, temperature monitoring, {{and the use of}} a miniature ultrasound probe for tissue differentiation during surgical operations, In neurosurgery, the needle used in the standard stereotactic CT or MRI guided brain biopsy provides no information about the tissue being sampled. The tissue sampled depends entirely upon the accuracy with which the localization provided by the preoperative CT or MRI scan is translated to the intracranial biopsy site. In addition, no information about the tissue being traversed by the needle (e. g., a blood vessel) is provided. Hemorrhage due to the biopsy needle tearing a blood vessel within the brain is the most devastating complication of stereotactic CT/MRI guided brain biopsy. A <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> testbed has been developed at NASA Ames Research Center as a spin-off of technologies from space, aeronautics and medical programs. The invention entitled "Robotic Neurosurgery Leading to Multimodality Devices for Tissue Identification" is nearing a state ready for commercialization. The devices will: 1) improve diagnostic accuracy and precision of general surgery, with near term emphasis on stereotactic brain biopsy, 2) automate tissue identification, with near term emphasis on stereotactic brain biopsy, to permit remote control of the procedure, and 3) reduce morbidity for stereotactic brain biopsy. The commercial impact from this work is the potential development of a whole new generation of smart surgical tools to increase the safety, accuracy and efficiency of surgical procedures. Other potential markets include smart surgical tools for tumor ablation in neurosurgery, general exploratory surgery, prostate cancer surgery, and breast cancer surgery...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of Neurosurgery craniectomy is a surgical procedure required due to diverse pathological processes. This procedure is usually performed manually by a surgeon using a milling device. As this procedure removes completely cranial bone, {{it has to be}} replaced by an implant. In order to achieve safety, efficiency of the process and accuracy for implant placement, such procedure requires good expertise and coordination of the surgeon. With the development of computer-assisted surgery and robotics, the application of such procedures took place also for craniectomy. These implementations are mainly intended to increase safety, accuracy and for optimization of the milling process. However the surgeon still has to be aware and perceive the status of the procedure to react or intervene in non-planned situations. The use of interface devices in terms of synergistic and haptic architectures is intended to re-integrate the surgeon to the control procedure, while preserving advantages of automatic parameter control. This work presents the investigation of the use of haptic technology in a <b>neurosurgery</b> <b>robotic</b> system for craniectomy, regarding aspects such as awareness, vigilance, workload, and safety as well as requirements of the milling process. A combination of haptic device and autonomous robot is proposed. For comparisons and evaluation of different operation modes (autonomous and synergistic as well as haptic master-slave interaction) experimental studies have been conducted using laboratory setups with different user groups, including computer based simulations. Results showed the potential of haptic technology in order to increase surgeons integration in the control of robotic system. Haptic feedback based control presented results similar to the autonomous implementation. Safety can be potentially increased due to faster surgeon reactions during the process, while milling process parameters could be controlled automatically. On the other hand, special care must be taken due to the increase of workload, however the haptic display solution showed lower increases compared to the synergistic mode...|$|R
40|$|Haptics {{provides}} sensory stimuli {{that represent}} the interaction with a virtual or tele-manipulated object, and it is considered a valuable navigation and manipulation tool during tele-operated surgical procedures. Haptic feedback can be provided to the user via cutaneous information and kinesthetic feedback. Sensory subtraction removes the kinesthetic component of the haptic feedback, having only the cutaneous component provided to the user. Such a technique guarantees a stable haptic feedback loop, while it keeps the transparency of the tele-operation system high, {{which means that the}} system faithfully replicates and render back the user’s directives. This work focuses on checking whether the interaction forces during a bench model neurosurgery operation can lie in the solely cutaneous perception of the human finger pads. If this assumption is found true, {{it would be possible to}} exploit sensory subtraction techniques for providing surgeons with feedback from neurosurgery. We measured the forces exerted to surgical tools by three neurosurgeons performing typical actions on a brain phantom, using contact force sensors, while the forces exerted by the tools to the phantom tissue were recorded using a load cell placed under the brain phantom box. The measured surgeon–tool contact forces were 0. 01 – 3. 49 N for the thumb and 0. 01 – 6. 6 N for index and middle finger, whereas the measured tool–tissue interaction forces were from six to 11 times smaller than the contact forces, i. e., 0. 01 – 0. 59 N. The measurements for the contact forces fit the range of the cutaneous sensitivity for the human finger pad; thus, we can say that, in a tele-operated <b>robotic</b> <b>neurosurgery</b> scenario, it would possible to render forces at the fingertip level by conveying haptic cues solely through the cutaneous channel of the surgeon’s finger pads. This approach would allow high transparency and high stability of the haptic feedback loop in a tele-operation system...|$|E
