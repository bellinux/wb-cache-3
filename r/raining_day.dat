When it is cold and raining, wearing shorts and t-shirt is not a good solution. The {{indentation}} indicates an exception to the rule, so the second day “cold and raining ” is an exception, needing a different conclusion. Because wearing shorts and a t-shirt was not a good solution, the exception, “raining- wear coat ” is added. To add the exception a difference between the first “Normal day ” and the second day is needed. Either raining or cold can be used as an attribute to distinguish between the two cases. When picking attributes an expert tends to perform better than a novice. Experts tend to be better at picking attributes to distinguish between cases and as a result end Key: Attribute – Conclusion Case: up with a more compact set of rules, see [Kang 95]. Experts are able to define complex attributes that distinguish between cases. Also by examining attributes picked by novices it has been possible to identify incorrect assumptions made by the novice. On the third day it is windy, hot and sunny, so the first conclusion is possible, but instead a new exception is added, “Windy- Take kite”. By adding this exception the next time it is windy the conclusion take kite will be used, this is because there are no exceptions to the “Windy-Take kite ” rule in the rule base.

The result for each parameter in water quality is classified based on National Water Quality Standard (NWQS) and Water Quality Index (WQI). A total of six sampling stations were selected for this study which are Laut Gumum, Laut Jerangking, Laut Kenawar, Laut Melai, Laut Pulau Balai and Resort Tasik Chini. Thirteen water quality parameters were analyzed based on in-situ and ex-situ analysis during two season's period. The methods used for laboratory analysis are based on APHA, HACH and IDEXX Colilert Methods. For physical parameter, the water quality findings were: turbidity (3. 1 - 61. 35 NTU), temperature (26. 44 - 31. 95 °C) and TSS (324. 33 mgIL). The findings for chemical parameter were BOD (1. 6 - 7. 55 mg/L), COD (13 - 67 mg/L), DO (2. 75 - 8. 38 mg/L), nitrate (0. 01 - 0. 14 mg/L), phosphate (0. 01 - 1. 23 mg/L), pH (4. 96 - 6. 48), ammoniacal nitrogen (0. 007 - 0. 073 mg/L), and electrical conductivity (16 - 35 RS/cm). The findings for biological parameter were total coliform (67 - 739 MPN/ 1 OOml) and E-coli (1. 7 - 135. 9 MPN/lOOml). The range of every parameter is higher during wet day compare to dry day. The water quality was majorly impacted at station Laut Jerangking due to nearest logging activities and rubber plantation while at station Laut Gumum due to nearest agricultural activities, palm oil plantation and settlement of indigenous people. From the analysis, the logging activities near Laut Jerangking did affected the water quality by physical, chemical and biological means. The deterioration of water quality cause the increasing growth of cat tail (Cabombafurcata) and the growth of water lily which can be easily found previously (Nelumbo nucfera) had currently decreasing. The NWQS for the lake in both seasons is in Class II while the WQI was classified under Class II which is slightly polluted. This shows that the lake is in degradation state which can cause long term deterioration if no drastic lake's restoration is carried out...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This {{paper was}} based on the Poyang lake Basin’s 55 a {{rainfall}} data (1959 ~ 2014). First, the recursive linear interpolation method was used to complete the daily precipitation observation data of 55 a to establish the Poyang lake basin’s data. Then the linear regression method was used to study the change trend of Poyang lake basin: the number of days of rainfall, <b>days</b> of light <b>rain,</b> <b>days</b> of heavy <b>rain,</b> <b>days</b> of rainstorm and days of continuous no rainfall. The results suggest that: 1) In the past 55 a, there is no apparently change trend in precipitation between the annual and flood season. The precipitation has been with cyclical fluctuations. 2) The monthly variation trends in the water level of stations in Poyang lake basin are basically in accordance with the precipitation’s trends. 3) The precipitation has similar characteristics in spatial distribution between the annual and flood season, most concentrates in Raohe basin and XinJiang basin. 4) The total number of rainy <b>days</b> and light <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> shows a decreasing trend, but the heavy <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> and rainstorm days increase significantly on versus.

Only COLs with a minimum spatial distribution, defined as {{more than a third of}} the rainfall stations that need to report rainfall on at least 1 day of a COL event, are considered for analysis of rainfall attributes. These attributes include the occurrence of COL <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> of different magnitudes, the distribution of the depth and temperature of the COL centres for the <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> of different magnitudes, the associated spatial distribution of rainfall as well as the associated atmospheric circulation.

40|$|Clear {{characterisation}} {{of daily}} rainfall over the southern African continent {{is necessary for}} the purpose of achieving sustainable human and agricultural-environmental development. In this research, daily rainfall variability over southern Africa is investigated to determine the relations between rainfall, rainfall frequency, and amount of <b>rain</b> per <b>rain</b> <b>day.</b> Firstly, the characterisation of daily rainfall over the region from 1950 to 1997 is given. This is followed by the analysis of daily rainfall variability during the 10 wettest and driest years. Thirdly, the influence of Sep-Nov and Dec-Feb seasons on the 10 wettest and driest years is then highlighted. Lastly, to determine whether the relation between the three rainfall parameters determined over the whole southern African region holds true for local areas, daily rainfall variability over Swaziland during the period of meteorological records is discussed. Analyses of daily rainfall over southern Africa indicate that on scales of days to years, rainfall departures from mean result from changes in both daily rainfall frequency and intensity. Positive rainfall changes are due to {{an increase in the number}} of rainy days and amount of rainfall falling on those <b>rain</b> <b>days.</b> Negative rainfall changes results from a decrease in rainfall frequency and rain falling on those <b>rain</b> <b>days.</b> Southern Africa does not show uniform changes in these rainfall variables, but patterns. of spatial and temporal variability. This variability increases from the Western regions of the subcontinent (i. e. rainfall variability increases from the eastern humid to the western arid regions of the subcontinent).

The occurrence of abrupt changes and trends were examined and identified using the Pettitt test, a combination of cumulative sum charts (CUSUM) and bootstrapping and the sequential version of Mann-Kendall rank tests. A sudden change and shift in {{the average of the}} total rainfall and annual number of <b>rain</b> <b>days</b> occurred in 1957. Annual total rainfall series from Madaba and Mafraq stations are also analyzed and showed similar change and shift points as that which appeared in AAM station.
