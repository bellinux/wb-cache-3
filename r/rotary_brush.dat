40|$|Caries {{are caused}} by dental plaque biofilms that create acids when they metabolize dietary sugars such as sucrose. Fluoride can prevent caries by (1) {{enhancing}} remineralization of tooth enamel, (2) reducing enamel solubility in acidic conditions, and (3) inhibiting or modifying biofilm metabolism and reducing acidification. The efficacy of fluoride is not systemic but topical. Therefore, more effective delivery of fluoride to stagnation sites, such as the interproximal regions of posterior teeth, {{may contribute to the}} reduction of caries in these regions. Power brushing generates turbulence and currents in the fluid (ie, toothpaste-saliva mixture), and it is expected to increase the delivery of fluoride and other solutes into otherwise stagnant areas. To test this hypothesis, we used a 2 -chamber method in which we measured the rate at which fluoride passed from one chamber into the other through a biofilm-colonized cellulose ester membrane under 3 conditions: no <b>brushing,</b> <b>rotary</b> power <b>brushing</b> (Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9000), and sonic brushing (Sonicare FlexCare). For comparative purposes, we used the mass transfer coefficient (K) of fluoride, which is a measure of how quickly fluoride is delivered through the biofilm-colonized membrane. Power brushing significantly increased the delivery rate of fluoride through the biofilm compared with no brushing (P <. 001). <b>Rotary</b> <b>brushing</b> increased the mass transfer coefficient of fluoride through the biofilm-colonized membrane by 79 % (P =. 002), whereas sonic brushing generated the greatest increase of 129 % (P <. 001). Sonic brushing generated a fluoride mass transfer coefficient that was 29 % greater than that of <b>rotary</b> <b>brushing</b> (P <. 05).

5000|$|The {{difference}} from conventional wire-brushing with an angle grinder lies {{first with the}} mounting of the bristles in the rotating brush. With a conventional <b>rotary</b> <b>brush,</b> the wire bristles are mounted rigidly in the hub, bristles sometimes being twisted or knotted in groups for extra stiffness. With bristle blasting, the wires are mounted resiliently in a flexible belt. As the brush rotates, immediately before contacting the work, rows of bristles are trapped behind a fixed [...] 'accelerator bar' , which causes them to bend backwards in their flexible mount. As the bristles pass the accelerator bar, they are released to spring forwards. The extra energy stored for each bristle when being flexed backwards is added to their kinetic energy when released, and when they impact {{the surface of the}} workpiece. This gives a more violent impact with the surface, thus greater cleaning power, compared to a simple <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> at the same speed.|$|E

An orthodontic treatment shadowed by repeated bonding failures can become unduly long and will decrease patient trust and compliance. Optical coherence tomography has been widely used in ophtalmology but is relatively new to dentistry. Using OCT one can detect aerial inclusions within the orthodontic adhesive or even identify incongruence between the bracket base and the tooth surface. The aim of our {{study was to identify}} bonding defects and reconstruct them three-dimensionally {{in order to be able}} to characterize them more accurately. We bonded 30 sound human permanent teeth with ceramic orthodontic brackets using a no-mix self-curing orthodontic adhesive. Prior to bonding all teeth were stored in tap water at 4 Â°C and then professionally cleaned with <b>rotary</b> <b>brushes</b> and pumice. The samples were processed by the same person and the <b>rotary</b> <b>brushes</b> were changed after every fifth tooth. All interfaces were investigated by means of OCT and 4 defects were found. Subsequently, the defects were reconstructed threedimensionally using an open-source program. By identifying and reconstructing bonding defects we could assess the quality of the bonding procedure. Since bonding tends to be more accurate in vitro where the environmental conditions are close to ideal, it is probable that defects found in vivo be even greater in number, which leads to the conclusion that this type of investigation is potentially valuable.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this in vitro study was to establish the antimicrobial efficacy {{and the effect of}} different activation methods on the smear layer at the coronal level of straight root canals of four different root canal irrigation solutions. The four irrigation solutions were 3. 5 % sodium hypochlorite liquid (NaOCl), 2 % sodium hypochlorite gel, chlorhexidine gluconate liquid and a mixture of 100 mg doxycycline capsules with 2 ml sterile water. ANTIMICROBIAL EFFECTS: The surfaces of four agar plates were inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and divided into four equal quadrants. Ten microlitres of each test solution was dispensed onto the four filter paper disks on each agar plate. The antibacterial activity of materials was apparent from circular clear inhibition zones forming around the filtration paper. The diameters of these inhibition zones were measured using a micrometer gauge. EFFECT ON SMEAR LAYER: Access cavities were prepared on fifty, extracted, single rooted, human teeth and the root canals prepared with rotary files. The teeth were randomly divided into five groups (n = 10) and each group irrigated with a different irrigation solution. Different activation methods were used in the coronal portion of each root canal. The solutions were activated in the canals using one of the following methods: a 30 gauge needle (Control), a sonic scaler tip, and a <b>rotary</b> <b>brush.</b> After sampling, the roots of the treated teeth were fractured and prepared for Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) according to standard methods. The one-way ANOVA test was used to determine whether there were any statistical significant differences between the different groups. The average zones of inhibition for 3. 5 % NaOCl, 2 % NaOCl, 2. 5 % chlorhexidine and doxycycline were 2. 7 mm, 2. 0 mm, 11. 2 mm and 12. 4 mm respectively.

In the first case, the nylon and sisal fiber were more efficient at higher rotations. PET bristles at 40 rpm rotation were inefficient, presenting a cleaning index (CI) lower than 50 %. The nylon brush treatment at 120 rpm was the most efficient cleaning process (CI= 91 %). However, nylon brushes at 160 rpm treatment showed the lowest CI (88 %). These results were probably associated to the fact that, at higher speeds, fruits tended to jump, causing a poor contact between bristles and fruits. The lowest CI was observed on coconut fiber at 80 and 120 rpm treatments. In general, cleaned fruits with nylon and sisal fiber at 120 rpm demonstrated higher post-harvest quality alterations when compared to cleaned fruits in these brushes at 160 rpm.

40|$|The Liquid Waste Technology Development {{organization}} is investigating technologies to support closure of radioactive waste tanks at the Savannah River Site (SRS). Tank closure includes {{removal of the}} wastes that have propagated to the tank annulus. Although amounts and types of residual waste materials in the annuli of SRS tanks vary, simple salt deposits are predominant on tanks with known leak sites. This task focused on developing and demonstrating a technology to inspect and spot clean salt deposits from the outer primary tank wall located in the annulus of an SRS Type I tank. The Robotics, Remote and Specialty Equipment (RRSE) and Materials Science and Technology (MS&T) Sections of the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) collaborated to modify and equip a Force Institute magnetic wall crawler with the tools necessary to demonstrate the inspection and spot cleaning in a mock-up of a Type I tank annulus. A remote control camera arm and cleaning head were developed, fabricated and mounted on the crawler. The crawler was then tested and demonstrated on a salt simulant also developed in this task. The demonstration showed that the camera is capable of being deployed in all specified locations and provided the views needed for the planned inspection. It also showed that the salt simulant readily dissolves with water. The crawler features two different techniques for delivering water to dissolve the salt deposits. Both water spay nozzles were able to dissolve the simulated salt, one is more controllable and the other delivers a larger water volume. The cleaning head also includes a <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> to mechanically remove the simulated salt nodules in the event insoluble material is encountered. The <b>rotary</b> <b>brush</b> proved {{to be effective in}} removing the salt nodules, although some fine tuning may be required to achieve the best results. This report describes the design process for developing technology to add features to a commercial wall crawler and the results of the demonstration testing performed on the integrated system. The crawler was modified to address the two primary objectives of the task (inspection and spot cleaning). SRNL recommends this technology as a viable option for annulus inspection and salt removal in tanks with minimal salt deposits (such as Tanks 5 and 6.) This report further recommends that the technology be prepared for field deployment by: (1) developing an improved mounting system for the magnetic idler wheel, (2) improving the robustness of the cleaning tool mounting, (3) resolving the nozzle selection valve connections, (4) determining alternatives for the brush and bristle assembly, and (5) adding a protective housing around the motors to shield them from water splash. In addition, SRNL suggests further technology development to address annulus cleaning issues that are apparent on other tanks that will also require salt removal in the future such as: (1) Developing a duct drilling device to facilitate dissolving salt inside ventilation ducts and draining the solution out the bottom of the ducts. (2) Investigating technologies to inspect inside the vertical annulus ventilation duct...|$|E

5000|$|In the 1990s, new {{polymers}} began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) {{soil particles}} into dry residues on contact. In the conventional cleaning process surfactant molecules attach themselves to oily soil particles, suspending them (emulsification) {{so that they}} can be easily rinsed away. Surfactant (detergent) molecules and emulsified soils which escape being rinsed away, remain in the fibre and continue to attract soiling, causing the condition of the carpet to degenerate; often re-soiling faster than before it was subjected to the cleaning process. Encapsulators are speciality detergent polymers which become part of the detergent system. As drying occurs (20-30 min. drytime), after cleaning, these encapsulators bind the detergent molecules and residual soils in a brittle, crystalline structure. Detergent and soil particles can no longer attract other soils and are easily removed by dry vacuuming. In addition to binding the detergent and soil residues the encapsulation chemistry coats the clean fibre with the same brittle film. This reduces the fibre’s affinity for oily and particulate soils. As this brittle film"breaks away" [...] and more soil is removed, the appearance of the fibre improves as opposed to soiling more rapidly. Products which also employ fluorochemical technology, display dramatically extended anti re-soiling time periods.Cleaning solution is applied by <b>rotary</b> machine, <b>brush</b> applicator, or compression sprayer.

Depois, com os melhores resultados, foram avaliadas a eficácia da limpeza em tomates e a qualidade pós-colheita dos frutos mensurada pela perda de massa (%), atividade respiratória (CO 2) e evolução da concentração de etileno. No primeiro ensaio, as cerdas de náilon, sisal e fibra de coco combinadas com as altas rotações tornaram a limpeza mais eficaz. A cerda PET e a rotação de 40 rpm foram ineficientes, apresentando um índice de limpeza (IL) {{inferior}} a 50 %. Para os tomates, o tratamento com náilon a 120 rpm foi o mais eficaz na limpeza (IL= 91 %); todavia, o tratamento com náilon 160 rpm apresentou um IL inferior (88 %), pois, devido à alta velocidade, os frutos pulavam e não eram envoltos pelas cerdas. Menores IL foram obtidos com fibra de coco a 80 e 120 rpm, mas não estatisticamente diferentes. De modo geral, frutos limpos com náilon e sisal a 120 rpm apresentaram as maiores alterações na qualidade pós-colheita quando comparados aos frutos limpos nessas mesmas cerdas a 160 rpm. Maior flexibilidade das cerdas proporciona maior contato fruto/cerdas, com melhoria na eficiência de limpeza, o que pode provocar alterações na qualidade pós-colheita do fruto, porém não significativas.

The nylon brush treatment at 120 rpm was the most efficient cleaning process (CI= 91 %). However, nylon brushes at 160 rpm treatment showed the lowest CI (88 %). These results were probably associated to the fact that, at higher speeds, fruits tended to jump, causing a poor contact between bristles and fruits. The lowest CI was observed on coconut fiber at 80 and 120 rpm treatments. In general, cleaned fruits with nylon and sisal fiber at 120 rpm demonstrated higher post-harvest quality alterations when compared to cleaned fruits in these brushes at 160 rpm. More bristles flexibility provides better contact fruit/bristles increasing cleaning efficiency, however, it can cause changes on post-harvest fruit quality, but no significant...|$|R
