Wilders was first accused of criminally insulting <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> groups and inciting hatred and discrimination. He {{was found not guilty}} in June 2011.

5|$|Because of <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> discrimination, Roman Catholics in {{the late}} 19th century were {{regularly}} excluded from labor unions, popular fraternal organizations, and other organized groups that provided such social services. Papal encyclicals issued by the Holy See prohibited Catholics from participating as lodge members within Freemasonry. McGivney intended to create an alternative organization. He also believed that Catholicism and fraternalism could be compatible and wanted to found a society to encourage men {{to be proud of}} their American-Catholic heritage.|$|E
5|$|Israelâ€™s culinary traditions {{comprise}} {{foods and}} cooking methods that span three {{thousand years of}} history. Over that time, these traditions have been shaped by influences from Asia, Africa and Europe, and <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> influences {{have resulted in a}} culinary melting pot.

40|$|Strategic {{alliance}} {{research has}} shown that national cultural similarity between partner firms can reduce transaction costs and positively influence cross-border alliance formation and performance. Yet, social identity research in psychology suggests that cultural similarity can give rise to in-group favoritism, which can lead partner firms sharing similar cultural backgrounds to cooperate with each other to defend their shared identity instead of pursuing economic efficiencies associated with cultural similarity. To investigate in-group favoritism associated with cultural similarity, we examine the influence of cross-regional <b>religious</b> similarity <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> similarity in the U. S. on domestic strategic alliance formation and alliance announcement returns. We find that cross-regional <b>religious</b> similarity <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> similarity in the U. S. positively affect the volume of interstate alliance activities, but are negatively associated with combined alliance announcement returns of partner firms. These findings suggest that cross-regional <b>religious</b> similarity <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> similarity facilitate interstate alliance activities between U. S. states, but investors seem to negatively interpret alliance decisions that can be potentially driven by in-group favoritism...|$|R
5|$|Michael J. McGivney, an Irish-American Catholic priest, {{founded the}} Knights of Columbus in New Haven, Connecticut. He {{gathered}} {{a group of}} men from St. Mary's Parish for an organizational meeting on October 2, 1881. Several months later, the Order was incorporated under the laws of the state of Connecticut on March 29, 1882; this was during the Golden age of fraternalism in the United States, when numerous civic, <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> associations were being founded. Although its first councils were all in Connecticut, the Order spread throughout New England and the United States in subsequent years. By 1889, there were 300 councils comprising 40,000 knights. Twenty years later, in 1909, there were 230,000 knights in 1,300 councils.|$|E
5|$|Durga Puja is the biggest, {{most popular}} and widely celebrated festival in West Bengal. The five-day-long {{colourful}} Hindu festival witnesses intense celebration across the state. Pandals are erected in various cities, towns and villages throughout West Bengal. The whole city of Kolkata undergoes a transformation during Durga Puja, as it is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of goddess Durga and her four children are worshipped and displayed. The idols of the goddess as brought in from Kumortuli, where idol-makers work round the year fashioning the clay-models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than a religious festival, where people across diverse <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> spectrum partake in the festivity. On Vijayadashami, {{the last day of}} the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being dumped into the rivers.|$|E
5|$|In 1928, the Nehru Commission {{composing}} {{of representatives}} of Indian political parties proposed constitutional reforms for India that apart from calling for dominion status for India and elections under universal suffrage, would guarantee rights deemed fundamental, representation for <b>religious</b> <b>and</b> <b>ethnic</b> minorities, {{and limit the}} powers of the government. In 1931, the Indian National Congress (the largest Indian political party of the time) adopted resolutions committing itself to the defence of fundamental civil rights, as well as socio-economic rights such as the minimum wage and the abolition of untouchability and serfdom. Committing themselves to socialism in 1936, the Congress leaders took examples from the constitution of the erstwhile USSR, which inspired the fundamental duties of citizens as a means of collective patriotic responsibility for national interests and challenges.|$|E

The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations.
