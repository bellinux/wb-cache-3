2500|$|In 1895 {{he began}} the {{experiments}} which would eventually lead to his invention of the <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>system.</b> He was a frequent visitor to Ireland and in 1905 he married the Hon.

[...] The marriage broke down and the couple were granted an annulment in 1927, after which he married the Countess Bezzi-Scali of Rome. He received numerous awards and honours including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1909 and was conferred with the hereditary title of Marchese in 1929. He died in Rome on 20 July 1937.|$|E
50|$|Beginning in 1896, Guglielmo Marconi {{produced}} a <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>system</b> that used spark transmitters, which {{could only be}} used by trained operators, and was limited to Morse code transmissions. In contrast, Collins sought to develop a wireless telephone {{that could be used}} by the general public for point-to-point communication.|$|E
25|$|In May 1910, the Radio Telephone Company and its {{subsidiaries}} were reorganized as the North American Wireless Corporation, but {{financial difficulties}} {{meant that the}} company's activities had nearly come to a halt. De Forest moved to San Francisco, California, and in early 1911 took a research job at the Federal Telegraph Company, which produced long-range <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>systems</b> using high-powered Poulsen arcs.|$|R

50|$|Following {{overland}} {{tests at}} Salisbury Plain during March 1897, on 13 May 1897, the Italian born and recently British based inventor, {{best known for}} his development of a <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>system,</b> Guglielmo Marconi, assisted by George Kemp (who was a Cardiff based Post Office engineer) transmitted and received the first wireless signals over open sea between Lavernock Point and Flat Holm island.|$|E

5000|$|In 1894, Professor Henry Russell {{conducted}} a classroom {{demonstration of the}} transmission and reception of electromagnetic radiation (radio signals). A fascinated Shoemaker conducted further experiments at his home, using a spark-gap transmitter, plus a coherer receiver of his own design, which used a galvanometer's needle to strike and reset the coherer after each received Morse code signal. However, he did not publicize or patent any of his early work, so when he later testified that he had constructed a <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>system,</b> in April, 1895 {{at the age of}} 16, which anticipated Guglielmo Marconi's original patent, the U.S. courts would not accept his statement, bluntly declaring that [...] "His testimony is so utterly unsupported and insufficient and improbable that it will not be discussed".|$|E
50|$|After a {{few years}} of {{development}} the arc technology was transferred to Germany and Great Britain in 1906 by Poulsen, his collaborator Peder Oluf Pedersen and their financial backers. In 1909 the American patents as well as a few arc converters were bought by Cyril Frank Elwell. The subsequent development in Europe and the United States was rather different, since in Europe there were severe difficulties for many years implementing the Poulsen technology, whereas in the United States an extended commercial <b>radiotelegraph</b> <b>system</b> was soon established with the Federal Telegraph Company. Later the US Navy also adopted the Poulsen system. Only the arc converter with passive frequency conversion was suitable for portable and maritime use. This made it the most important mobile radio system for about a decade until it was superseded by vacuum tube systems.|$|E
