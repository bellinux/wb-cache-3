We find that the evolution of the system depends strongly on the simulation method. But both in simulations with a Contact Dynamics algorithm, which prescribes the basic Coulomb's law of friction, and in simulations with molecular dynamics, which prescribes a regularized form of Coulomb's law, a steady state with very similar collective <b>rotation</b> <b>modes</b> is reached. As long as the static and dynamic friction coefficients are equal, the <b>rotation</b> <b>modes</b> are independent of the initial conditions.

5000|$|In {{experiments}} on single species plasmas, plasma rotation {{rates in the}} tens of kHz range are not uncommon, even in the slow <b>rotation</b> <b>mode.</b> This rapid rotation is necessary to provide the confining radial Lorentz force for the plasma. However, if there is neutral gas in the trap, collisions between the plasma and the gas cause the plasma rotation to slow, leading to radial expansion of the plasma until it comes in contact with the surrounding electrodes and is lost. This loss process can be alleviated by operating the trap in an ultra high vacuum. However, even under such conditions the plasma rotation can still be slowed through the interaction of the plasma with [...] "errors" [...] in the external confinement fields. If these fields are not perfectly cylindrically symmetric, the asymmetries can torque on the plasma, reducing the rotation rate. Such field errors are unavoidable in any actual experiment, and limit the plasma confinement time.|$|E

There is an objective based <b>rotation</b> <b>mode,</b> called Warzone (Killzone 2, Killzone 3, and Shadow Fall), where players play all game modes (2 rounds of Assassination, 1 round of Body Count, 1 round of Capture and Hold, 2 rounds of Search and Destroy, and 1 round of Search and Retrieve) {{one after the other}} until all modes have been played. Shadow Fall's game modes in Warzone are slightly different. Operations is a new mode for Killzone 3 which is a cinematic mini-campaign for the multiplayer mode. Killzone 3 also features a classic team deathmatch mode called Guerilla Warfare. Shadow Fall also has a team deathmatch, simply titled Team Deathmatch. Killzone and Killzone 3 are the only games in the series to feature offline split-screen co-op for two players, while Killzone is the only game in the series to feature offline split-screen multi-player in the Botzone mode (Botzone allows players to play against AI bots and is present in each installment). Liberation features an online co-op campaign as well as a multi-player mode that supports up to 6 players in ad-hoc and up to 8 players on infrastructure.

40|$|Weak lensing {{has become}} an {{increasingly}} important tool in cosmology {{and the use of}} galaxy shapes to measure cosmic shear has become routine. The weak-lensing distortion tensor contains two other effects in addition to the two components of shear: the convergence and rotation. The <b>rotation</b> <b>mode</b> is not measurable using the standard cosmic shear estimators based on galaxy shapes, as there is no information on the original shapes of the images before they were lensed. Due to this, no estimator has been proposed for the <b>rotation</b> <b>mode</b> in cosmological weak-lensing surveys, and the <b>rotation</b> <b>mode</b> has never been constrained. Here, we derive an estimator for this quantity, which is based on the use of radio polarisation measurements of the intrinsic position angles of galaxies. The <b>rotation</b> <b>mode</b> can be sourced by physics beyond ΛCDM, and also offers the chance to perform consistency checks of ΛCDM and of weak-lensing surveys themselves. We present simulations of this estimator and show that, for the pedagogical example of cosmic string spectra, this estimator could detect a signal that is consistent with the constraints from Planck. We examine the connection between the <b>rotation</b> <b>mode</b> and the shear B-modes and thus how this estimator could help control systematics in future radio weak-lensing surveys...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{studies of}} MHD modes, {{including}} dynamics and stability, using a biased electrode for rotation {{control on the}} High Beta Tokamak –- Extended Pulse (HBT-EP) are presented. When the probe is inserted into {{the edge of the}} plasma and a voltage applied, the rotation of long-wavelength kink instabilities is strongly modified. A large poloidal plasma flow results at the edge, measured with a bi-directional Mach probe with changes in edge kink <b>mode</b> <b>rotation</b> at different biases. This poloidal plasma rotation cannot fully account for the large <b>mode</b> <b>rotation</b> frequency on HBT-EP. By including the electron fluid motion, the <b>mode</b> <b>rotation</b> predictions agree with measurements, indicating that the modes travel with the electron fluid. A GPU-based digital feedback system is used to adjust the probe voltage in real time for controlling both the plasma flow and <b>mode</b> <b>rotation.</b> This active <b>mode</b> <b>rotation</b> control is desirable because it allows for MHD stabilization, as well as studies under conditions of varying <b>mode</b> <b>rotation</b> rates. <b>Mode</b> dynamics were studied using various diagnostics to understand how plasma conditions fluctuate during mode activity and to understand the interaction of the bias probe with the plasma during this activity. Phase-dependent mode behavior was observed, especially at slow <b>mode</b> <b>rotation,</b> which might be attributed to an intrinsic error field or a nonlinear interaction between the bias probe and the mode. Applied resonant magnetic perturbations were used to study the dynamic response of a stable plasma with different <b>mode</b> <b>rotations.</b> At slower rotation, the plasma had a greater response to the perturbations and the plasma reached a saturated response with large perturbations, similar to previous results. At large positive biases, the probe current induces a torque that opposes the natural direction of <b>mode</b> <b>rotation.</b> By applying a sufficiently large torque, a transition is induced into a fast <b>rotation</b> state (both <b>mode</b> and plasma <b>rotation).</b> High poloidal shear flows at the edge were measured in this state, similar to conditions in H-mode plasmas on other devices. The bias required to induce the transition is shown to depend on an applied error field. A technique was established using this transition to determine the natural error field on HBT-EP...|$|R

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that the shallow-water {{equations}} in a rotating framework admit exact solutions for which the velocity Components are linear and the height field is quadratic in the coordinate variables. The resulting 12 coefficients are, in general, functions of time and are governed by a set of nonlinear, coupled, ordinary differential equations. While previous analytical solutions have been plagued by a reduced number of degrees of freedom, the most general solution presented here contains 10 arbitrary constants of integration. These degrees of freedom can be sorted as follows: 4 are accounted for by inertial oscillations of the vortex' center of mass, 2 by an average circular structure (depth and radius), 2 by a circular pulsation mode (amplitude and phase), and 2 by 1 of 2 possible elliptical <b>rotation</b> <b>modes</b> (amplitude and phase). The complete solution with 12 degrees of freedom would be achieved if these 2 elliptical modes could be incorporated simultaneously. Unfortunately, the solution that includes the nonlinear interaction between the elliptical <b>rotation</b> <b>modes</b> has yet to be found. The present solution sheds some light on the behavior of time-dependent elliptical warm-core rings as observed in the ocean. It can be used as the basis for further theoretical investigations and testing of numerical models. 1...|$|R
