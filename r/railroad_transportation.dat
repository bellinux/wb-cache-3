5|$|Industrialist Charles M. Schwab {{bought the}} Montgomery Shoshone Mine in 1906 and {{invested}} heavily in infrastructure, including piped water, electric lines and <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation,</b> that served the town {{as well as the}} mine. By 1907, Rhyolite had electric lights, water mains, telephones, newspapers, a hospital, a school, an opera house, and a stock exchange. Published estimates of the town's peak population vary widely, but scholarly sources generally place it in a range between 3,500 and 5,000 in 1907–08.|$|E
5|$|Railroad Gazette was a trade journal first {{published}} in April 1856 that focused on <b>railroad,</b> <b>transportation</b> and engineering topics. Master mechanics read and used the publication to share information about railway matters with one-another. An article in the publication documented what was purported {{to be the first}} locomotive run in the United States on a railroad, which was stated as performed by the author of the article. It also reported about the Erie Railroad's Rochester Division's electrification and about the opening of the Thebes Bridge. Railroad Gazette editors included Arthur Mellen Wellington and Matthias Nace Forney, and Horace Cleveland was an article contributor.|$|E
5|$|The early {{settlers}} of Minnesota were anxiously seeking <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation,</b> but insufficient {{capital was}} available after the Panic of 1857. Rails were finally built in Minnesota in 1862, when the St. Paul and Pacific Railroad built its first ten miles (16km) of track from the Phalen Creek area in St. Paul {{to a stop}} just short of St. Anthony Falls. The railroad continued building track from Minneapolis to Elk River in 1864 and to St. Cloud in 1866, and from Minneapolis west to Howard Lake in 1867 and Willmar in 1869. Meanwhile, the Minnesota Central, an early predecessor of the Milwaukee Road, built a line from Minneapolis to Fort Snelling in 1865. The railroad gradually extended to Faribault, Owatonna, and Austin. It crossed the Iowa border and met up with the McGregor & Western line. This connection gave Minneapolis rail service to Milwaukee via Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, with through service beginning on October 14, 1867.|$|E

5|$|The {{responsibility}} of the North Korean logistics was divided between the Ministry of National Defense (MND), led by Marshal Choe Yong Gun, and the NKPA Rear Service Department, commanded by General Choe Hong Kup. The MND was mainly responsible for <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> and supply procurement, while the Rear Service Department was responsible for road transportation. The North Koreans relied on a logistical system which was very lean and substantially smaller than the United Nations' system. This logistics network was therefore capable of moving far fewer supplies, and this caused considerable difficulty for front line troops. Based on the efficient Soviet model, this ground-based network relied primarily on railroads to transport supplies {{to the front lines}} while troops transported those items onto the individual units on foot, trucks, or carts. This second effort, though more versatile, was also a substantial disadvantage because it was less efficient and often too slow to follow the moving front-line units.|$|E

It {{is located in the}} middle of the country and is now beginning to make a name for itself as an industrial power within Mexico. The state was once a major silver miner and a major source of <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation,</b> the latter due to its strategic location, midway between the three most populous areas, namely Mexico City, Guadalajara, and Monterrey.|$|E
25|$|During the 1890s, as {{the local}} {{limonite}} industry declined and <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> improved, Thomas Iron switched from using local ore to hematite from Michigan or overseas. However, they continued to use New Jersey magnetite. By 1891, the company's Richard Mine was the largest producer of ore in New Jersey. The declining importance of local ore also prompted Crane and Thomas to divest themselves of the Catasauqua and Fogelsville: 60% of the stock in the railroad was sold to the Reading in 1890, which leased it in 1893.|$|E

25|$|Birmingham {{was founded}} in 1871, during the post-Civil War Reconstruction period, through the merger of three {{pre-existing}} farm towns, notably, former Elyton. It was named for Birmingham, England, the UK's second largest city and then major industrial city. The Alabama city annexed smaller neighbors and developed as an industrial and <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> center, based on mining, the new iron and steel industry, and railroading. Most of the original settlers who founded Birmingham were of English ancestry. The city was developed {{as a place where}} cheap, non-unionized, and African-American labor from rural Alabama could be employed in the city's steel mills and blast furnaces, giving it a competitive advantage over unionized industrial cities in the Midwest and Northeast.|$|E
25|$|By 1860, {{when the}} first rumblings of secession began to be heard across the South, antebellum Nashville was a prosperous city. The city's {{significance}} as a shipping port made it a desirable prize {{as a means of}} controlling important river and <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> routes. In February 1862, Nashville became the first state capital to fall to Union troops. The state was occupied by Union troops {{for the duration of the}} war. The Battle of Nashville (December 15–16, 1864) was a significant Union victory and perhaps the most decisive tactical victory gained by either side in the war; it was also the war's final major military action, which afterward became almost entirely a war of attrition consisting largely of guerrilla raids and small skirmishes, with the Confederate forces in the Deep South almost constantly in retreat.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, {{citizens}} of Wilmington became {{eager to take}} advantage of <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation.</b> Plans were developed to build a railroad line from the capital of Raleigh to Wilmington. This was later changed when the {{citizens of}} Raleigh did not care to make the venture of a stock subscription to secure the railroad. The end point was changed to Weldon. When construction of the railroad line was finally completed in 1840, it was the longest single line of railroad track in the world. The railroad also controlled a line of steamboats that ran from Wilmington to Charleston; it was widely used for passenger travel and transportation of freight. Regular boat lines served Fayetteville, and packet lines traveled to northern ports. The city was a main stop-over point, contributing greatly to its commerce.|$|E

25|$|Multiple {{settlements}} comprise present-day Saginaw. On {{the west}} side of the river the first settlement around what had been Fort Saginaw developed into Saginaw, which was incorporated as a city in 1857, containing the seat of the Saginaw County government. On the east side of the river a parallel settlement, East Saginaw, developed which was incorporated first as a village in 1855, and then as a city in 1859. Also south of East Saginaw, on the east bank of the river, the village of Salina formed. Salina's name relates to the salty brine that led to a growing industry of salt production in the area. Both Saginaw and East Saginaw quickly became a hub for <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> in addition to ships making their way on the Saginaw River.|$|E
25|$|Columbia {{received}} its first charter as {{a town in}} 1805. An intendant and six wardens would govern the town. John Taylor, the first elected intendant, later served {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, both houses of Congress, and eventually as governor. By 1816, there were 250 homes in the town and a population of more than one thousand. Columbia became chartered as a city in 1854, with an elected mayor and six aldermen. Two years later, Columbia had a police force consisting of a full-time chief and nine patrolmen. The city continued to grow at a rapid pace, and throughout the 1850s and 1860s Columbia was the largest inland city in the Carolinas. <b>Railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> served as a significant cause of population expansion in Columbia during this time. Rail lines that reached the city in the 1840s primarily transported cotton bales, not passengers. Cotton was the lifeblood of the Columbia community; in 1850 virtually all of the city's commercial and economic activity was related to cotton.|$|E
25|$|Golden {{is part of}} {{the network}} of the Regional Transportation District which {{provides}} bus and light rail service throughout the Denver metropolitan area. Its bus routes 16, GS, and SkyRide F (once a day) connect Golden with other points of the Denver metropolitan area and Boulder. The West Corridor (W line) of the FasTracks light rail line, which parallels 6th Avenue into Golden to its terminal at the Jefferson County Government Center, opened to the public April 26, 2013. This is a modern version of the historic trolley line that Golden interests spearheaded in the 1890s. At the same time the W Line opened, a Community Call-n-Ride bus launched in Golden offering flexible service along with regular stops within the city itself. The new bus system was designed to complement the light rail, extending the transit service into the whole community, including the downtown corridor. Although passengers are no longer served by heavy rail, Golden continues to be served by <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation</b> for cargo, and has been continuously since 1870. These lines are owned by the BNSF railroad and serve business interests in the northeastern end of the city. Within the Coors Brewery grounds it becomes the brewery's own in-house railroad.|$|E

500|$|The {{confluence}} of the Yakima, Snake, and Columbia rivers has been a meeting place for native peoples for centuries. The archaeological record of Native American habitation of this area stretches back over ten thousand years. Tribes and nations including the Yakama, Nez Perce, and Umatilla used the area for hunting, fishing, and gathering plant foods. Hanford archaeologists have identified numerous Native American sites, including [...] "pit house villages, open campsites, fishing sites, hunting/kill sites, game drive complexes, quarries, and spirit quest sites", and two archaeological sites were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Native American use of the area continued into the 20thcentury, even as the tribes were relocated to reservations. The Wanapum people were never forced onto a reservation, and they lived along the Columbia River in the Priest Rapids Valley until 1943. Euro-Americans began to settle {{the region in the}} 1860s, initially along the Columbia River south of Priest Rapids. They established farms and orchards supported by small-scale irrigation projects and <b>railroad</b> <b>transportation,</b> with small town centers at Hanford, White Bluffs, and Richland.|$|E
