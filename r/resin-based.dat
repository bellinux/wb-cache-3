25|$|Australian {{railways}} use several gauges {{across the}} states, although {{in most cases}} 9mm gauge track is used. Some modellers have used Z gauge track for Nn3 models of Queensland Railways. N scale modelling in Australia has been a cottage-industry affair, with typically small runs of <b>resin-based</b> models being produced. Some etch-brass kits have also been released. In most cases, the kits have been bodies designed to run on mechanisms or bogies available from overseas. Some very fine models are starting to emerge from various Australian manufacturers with many kits now available.|$|E
25|$|Manufacturers {{have started}} to engage Chinese {{manufacturers}} to produce very high quality wagons and locomotives. The Victorian producer Aust-N-Rail pioneered this approach, while in 2011, BadgerBits released Australia's first ready-to-run N gauge locomotive, a 48 class retailing for around A$240. A new manufacturer has {{arrived on the scene}} (November 2011) with Australia-N Railways using both Australian locally manufactured detail accessories and top end Chinese factories to produce their new locomotives and rolling stock. Australia-N Railways is releasing a new 81 Class designed from the rails up manufactured in China, which will be retailing at A$180. Other kits continue to be released using the more usual method of <b>resin-based</b> castings, and it is now possible to model railways in all states other than Tasmania, although the coverage is highly variable.|$|E
2500|$|Pollock {{started using}} {{synthetic}} <b>resin-based</b> paints called alkyd enamels, which {{at that time}} was a novel medium. Pollock described this use of household paints, instead of artist’s paints, as [...] "a natural growth out of a need". He used hardened brushes, sticks, and even basting syringes as paint applicators. Pollock's technique of pouring and dripping paint is thought {{to be one of the}} origins of the term action painting. With this technique, Pollock was able to achieve a more immediate means of creating art, the paint now literally flowing from his chosen tool onto the canvas. By defying the convention of painting on an upright surface, he added a new dimension by being able to view and apply paint to his canvases from all directions.|$|E
50|$|Amalgam is {{typically}} compared to <b>resin-based</b> composites because many applications are similar and many physical properties and costs are comparable.|$|E

50|$|These {{sealants}} have hydrophilic properties, {{allowing them}} to be an alternative of the hydrophobic resin in the generally wet oral cavity. <b>Resin-based</b> sealants are easily destroyed by saliva contamination.|$|E
50|$|Chemically curable glass ionomer cements are {{considered}} safe from allergic reactions {{but a few}} have been reported with <b>resin-based</b> materials. Nevertheless, allergic reactions are very rarely associated with both sealants.|$|E
50|$|<b>Resin-based</b> {{sealants}} {{are normally}} the preferred choice of material for denture sealants. GIC material {{may be used}} as a provisional protective material when there are concerns regarding adequate moisture control.|$|E

50|$|When the two dental {{sealants}} are compared, {{there has}} always been a contradiction as to which materials is more effective in caries reduction. Therefore, there are claims against replacing <b>resin-based</b> sealants, the current Gold Standard, with glass ionomer.|$|E
50|$|G10 is {{very similar}} to Micarta and Carbon Fiber laminates, because they are all <b>resin-based</b> laminates, except that the base {{material}} used is glass cloth. G10 is the toughest of the glass fiber resin laminates and therefore the most commonly used.|$|E
50|$|Keter {{manufactures}} a {{wide range}} of household and garden <b>resin-based</b> products, plastic storage solutions, and outdoor furniture: outdoor furniture, lifestyle and gardening, outdoor storage products, tool storage, kids, indoor storage, home organization and bath. It is one of Israel's largest manufacturers of plastic outdoor and garden furniture.|$|E
50|$|It {{is worth}} remembering the {{unavailability}} of effective paint, at this time. The surface finishes that did exist either had poor adhesion to their substrate, or required either a porous or an organic substrate to bond to. Today's <b>resin-based</b> paints for metals {{had not been}} invented.|$|E
50|$|Keter Plastic Ltd. (כתר פלסטיק) is an Israeli {{manufacturer}} and marketer of <b>resin-based</b> household and garden consumer products.

5000|$|... acrylic {{polyester}}s, pure polyester PAN fibers {{are used}} to make carbon fiber by roasting them in a low oxygen environment. Traditional acrylic fiber is used more often as a synthetic replacement for wool. Carbon fibers and PF fibers are noted as two <b>resin-based</b> fibers that are not thermoplastic, most others can be melted.|$|E
50|$|The dried {{rhizomes}} of {{couch grass}} were broken up {{and used as}} incense in medieval northern Europe where other <b>resin-based</b> types of incense were unavailable. Elymus repens (Agropyron repens) rhizomes {{have been used in}} the traditional Austrian medicine against fever, internally as a tea, syrup, or cold maceration in water, or externally applied as a crude drug.|$|E
50|$|For {{the fabric}} bag based pillows, the vermiculite, the fabric bag and the {{graphite}} are noncombustible. The graphite expands but forms no bond with anything around it, unlike the <b>resin-based</b> instumescents. There {{is also no}} significant release of chemically bound water. Usually the bags are not entirely filled and cannot be significantly compressed, requiring mesh or grid installations to stay in place.|$|E
50|$|The oak {{is still}} alive, but is in decline. In 1829 it had 14 main branches, today only 8 are left. In the 1920s the hollow inside the trunk {{was covered with}} {{limestone}}. The limestone was removed in the 1960s, replaced with <b>resin-based</b> filling and covered with bark. The living sapwood is very thin (5-20 cm). The weakened trunk has begun to lean toward the heavy branches.|$|E
5000|$|Jesmonite is a {{versatile}} material {{and is used}} in several ways. It is typically used for creating sculptures and other three-dimensional works, but {{can be used with}} other materials as a ground for painting. It {{can be used as a}} surface material in building and construction. It is considered an attractive alternative to other <b>resin-based</b> materials, such as polyester and fiberglass. It can be used for casting and laminating.|$|E
50|$|The most {{popularly known}} use of {{cinnabar}} is in Chinese carved lacquerware, {{a technique that}} apparently originated in the Song dynasty. The danger of mercury poisoning may be reduced in ancient lacquerware by entraining the powdered pigment in lacquer, but could still pose an environmental hazard if the pieces were accidentally destroyed. In the modern jewelry industry, the toxic pigment {{is replaced by a}} <b>resin-based</b> polymer that approximates the appearance of pigmented lacquer.|$|E
50|$|This <b>resin-based</b> lens {{material}} {{was created by}} Kaenon. SR-91 was certified by Colts Laboratories and received a score of 40 lines of resolution, the highest score offered by the facility for optical clarity and acuity (20 is a passing score; anything beyond 40 is undetectable to the human eye). SR-91 was the first non-polycarbonate material to pass the high-mass impact ANSI Z.87.1 testing {{and was the first}} to combine this passing score with the highest marks for clarity.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, E.I. Cueto {{created the}} first sealant {{material}}, which was methyl cyanoacrylate. However, this material was susceptible to bacterial breakdown over time, therefore was not an acceptable sealing material. Bunonocore made further advances in 1970 by developing bisphenol-a glycidyl dimethacrylate, which is a viscous resin commonly known as BIS-GMA. This material {{was used as the}} basis for many <b>resin-based</b> sealant/composite material developments in dentistry, as it is resistant to bacterial breakdown and forms a steady bond with etched enamel.|$|E

50|$|<b>Resin-based</b> {{sealants}} {{require an}} absolutely dry surface until polymerization is complete, {{so it is}} essential to avoid salivary contamination of the sealant site. A rubber dam or cotton roll isolation technique can be used to isolate the sealant site from saliva which is the common reason for sealant failure. Glass ionomer sealants have the advantage of not needing a dry field to be effective. In fact, the application procedure for glass ionomers can involve pressing a saliva-moistened finger onto the occlusal surface to push the sealant material into the pits and fissures.|$|E
50|$|The {{restoration}} of the mill began in 1977. The cap frame was removed on 17 August 1979 by Messrs Lennard & Lawn, millwrights, based at Caston. The new cap was fitted on 2 August 1979. The first pair of sails were fitted on 17 May 1980 and the second pair on 26 May 1983. The tower was coated with Bellecoat Stipple, a black <b>resin-based</b> protective covering. Internally, new floors were fitted, and a new stage constructed around the mill. Replacement machinery was sourced from other windmills. The drive for the sack hoist came from Harpley.|$|E
5000|$|Also {{featured}} {{were the}} [...] "Banana Buggies" [...] {{mentioned in the}} theme song. These were seen driven by each live-action character in the opening and closing segments and occasionally in the wraparound and music video segments as well. The buggies were customized Amphicat six-wheel drive all-terrain vehicles each decorated to resemble the character who drove them. Plastic 1/25 scale model kits were issued by Aurora Plastics Corporation under catalog number 832 beginning in 1969. These were never reissued by Aurora, but have since been released as high-end, <b>resin-based</b> kits.|$|E
5000|$|Fast ChIP (qChIP): The fast ChIP assay {{reduced the}} time by {{shortening}} two steps in a typical ChIP assay: (i) an ultrasonic bath accelerates the rate of antibody binding to target proteins—and thereby reduces immunoprecipitation time (ii) a <b>resin-based</b> (Chelex-100) DNA isolation procedure reduces the time of cross-link reversal and DNA isolation. However, the fast protocol is suitable only for large cell samples (in the range of 106~107). [...] Up to 24 sheared chromatin samples can be processed to yield PCR-ready DNA in 5 hours, allowing multiple chromatin factors be probed simultaneously and/or looking at genomic events over several time points.|$|E
50|$|Vigier {{produces}} {{all their}} instruments in France. Vigier makes each guitar or bass {{in three to}} five months—partly by hand and partly with machines. Woods—such as alder, maple, and ash—come from French forests. Rosewood and mahogany are imported from India and Honduras respectively. Pre-cut raw wood logs are sorted and dried naturally for three to seven years to achieve the desired moisture content. Bodies and necks are drawn on the blanks using templates—then cut, dried, and stored in a controlled environment. In addition to wood, Vigier uses other materials such as copper and steel alloys (Delta metal and iMetal) and Phenowood, a <b>resin-based</b> composite material.|$|E
50|$|As {{with other}} {{composite}} materials, a dental composite typically {{consists of a}} <b>resin-based</b> oligomer matrix, such as a bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate (BISGMA), urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) or polyceram) (PEX), and an inorganic filler such as silicon dioxide (silica). Compositions vary widely, with proprietary mixes of resins forming the matrix, as well as engineered filler glasses and glass ceramics. The filler gives the composite wear resistance and translucency. A coupling agent such as silane is used to enhance the bond between these two components. An initiator package (such as: camphorquinone (CQ), phenylpropanedione (PPD) or lucirin (TPO)) begins the polymerization reaction of the resins when external energy (light/heat, etc.) is applied. A catalyst package can control its speed.|$|E
50|$|In {{the second}} half of the 1920s {{production}} gradually shifted from being almost entirely based on natural raw materials (linseed oil, natural resins and pigments obtained from metals) to increasingly using synthetic raw materials.Largely employed to make explosives during World War I, nitrocellulose became commonplace in formulations of coatings for cars and other vehicles. Lechler was the first in Italy to develop, make and sell a product based on such a raw material, i.e. Lechleroid which dried fast, could be sprayed and came in a broad range of colours. In those same years, as the first alkyd resins became available the company developed a product line made up of coloured synthetic <b>resin-based</b> enamels Syntex.|$|E
50|$|However, the {{addition}} of resin to glass ionomers, improves properties significantly, allowing it to be more easily mixed and placed. Resin-modified glass ionomers allow equal or higher fluoride release and {{there is evidence of}} higher retention, higher strength and lower solubility. <b>Resin-based</b> glass ionomers have two setting reactions: an acid-base setting and a free-radical polymerisation. The free-radical polymerisation is the predominant mode of setting, as it occurs more rapidly than the acid-base setting, which is comparatively slower. Only the material properly activated by light will be optimally cured. The presence of resin protects the cement from water contamination. Due to the shortened working time, it is recommended that placement and shaping of the material occurs as soon as possible after mixing.|$|E
50|$|The ideal {{source of}} energy should be high energy to excite the {{peroxide}} molecules without overheating the pulp of the tooth. Lights are typically within the blue light spectrum as this {{has been found to}} contain the most effective wavelengths for initiating the hydrogen peroxide reaction. A power bleaching treatment typically involves isolation of soft tissue with a <b>resin-based,</b> light-curable barrier, application of a professional dental-grade hydrogen peroxide whitening gel (25-38% hydrogen peroxide), and exposure to the light source for 6-15 minutes. Recent technical advances have minimized heat and ultraviolet emissions, allowing for a shorter patient preparation procedure. Most power teeth whitening treatments can be done in approximately 30 minutes to one hour, in a single visit to a dental professional.|$|E
5000|$|The 1990s {{presented}} great {{improvements in}} light curing devices. As dental restorative materials advanced, so too did {{the technology to}} cure these materials; the focus was to improve the intensity {{in order to be}} able to cure faster and deeper. In 1998 the plasma arc curing light was introduced. [...] It uses a high intensity light source, a fluorescent bulb containing plasma, in order to cure the <b>resin-based</b> composite, and claimed to cure resin composite material within 3 seconds. In practice, however, while the plasma arc curing light proved to be popular, negative aspects (including, but not limited to, an expensive initial price, curing times longer than the claimed 3 seconds, and expensive maintenance) of these lights resulted in the development of other curing light technologies.|$|E
