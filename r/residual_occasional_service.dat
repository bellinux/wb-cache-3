50|$|This {{book does}} not include some liturgical {{resources}} that ordinarily {{are included in the}} previous service books, namely, ordinations, installations, and <b>occasional</b> <b>services</b> such as dedications. At the time of its publication, a major study on ordination is before the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). This had precluded the finalization of an ordination rite. The decision was made to do as other churches have done and produce a book of <b>occasional</b> <b>services</b> separate from the Book of Common Worship, which would include additional liturgical resources needed by the church, such as ordinations, installations, dedications, and other <b>occasional</b> <b>services,</b> and liturgies needed by presbyteries to fulfill their responsibilities.|$|R

40|$|The thesis "Pastoral {{aspects of}} the baptism in the current {{discussion}} in the German speaking countries" analyzes critically the theological discussion since the seventies. The baptism is deprived of its closely sacramental and christological determination and is treated as an <b>occasional</b> <b>service.</b> Biographical and ritual concepts of the <b>occasional</b> <b>services</b> attribute to these acts a special theological significance that cannot be derived from Christ's commission to preach the gospel, but rather is rooted in a piety, which targets {{the life cycle of}} individuals and families. <b>Occasional</b> <b>services</b> are therefore seen as a pastoral accompaniment of man in his fault (and critical) stage of life. Its aim is to convey his emotional and cognitive stabilization and assist in re-establishing his fluctuating identity. The practice of the baptism, in this perspective, must regard ambivalent experiences of parents and provide them an appropriate religious intervention. Traditional theological contents of the baptism are markedly eliminated with regard to the situation of the distant Christians who became estranged from the reflected Christianity.
