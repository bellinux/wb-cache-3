40|$|Purpose : The {{potential}} of diversified portfolio {{leads to the}} <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problem. There are many kinds of methods or rules to allocate <b>risk</b> <b>capital.</b>  However, they have flaws, such as non-continuity, unfairness. In {{order to get a}} better method, we propose a new risk measure to be the base of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation rule. Design/methodology/approach : We proposed two kinds of allocation methods: one is marginal risk contribution based on iso-entropic coherent risk measure(IE), the other one is to combine the minimal excess allocation(EBA) principle and IE into <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. The iso-entropic coherent risk measure has many advantages over others; it is continuous and more powerful in distinguishing risks, consistent with higher-order stochastic dominances than other risk measures. And EBA is consistent with the amount of risk, which means fairness for <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation. Findings : Through cases, simulations and empirical application, it shows that these two allocation rules satisfy some good properties, can be more efficient, more precise and fairer. And the EBA based on IE may be the better one. Research limitations/implications : However, there are some problems still open. One is how to treat the negative value of allocation.

Specifically, we review the recent literature on this issue, and clarify the economic assumptions behind this framework.

First, <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocations are theoretically unnecessary without deadweight costs for raising capital, which are not usually assumed in the business practices of financial institutions. Second, the risk-adjusted rate of return is redundant as it provides no additional information beyond the net present value.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{analyzes}} <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problems. For <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation problems, {{the aim is}} {{to allocate}} the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> of a firm to its divisions. <b>Risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation is of central importance in risk-based performance measurement. We consider a case in which the aggregate <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> is determined via a coherent risk measure. The academic literature advocates an allocation rule that, in game-theoretic terms, is equivalent to using the Aumann-Shapley value as solution concept. This value is however not well-defined in case a differentiability condition is not satisfied. As an alternative, we introduce an allocation rule inspired by the Shapley value in a fuzzy setting. We take a grid on a fuzzy participation set, define paths on this grid and construct an allocation rule based on a path. Then, we define a rule as the limit of the average over these allocations, when the grid size converges to zero. We introduce this rule for a broad class of coherent risk measures. We show that if the Aumann-Shapley value is well-defined, the allocation rule coincides with it. If the Aumann-Shapley value is not defined, which is due to non-differentiability problems, the allocation rule specifies an explicit allocation. It corresponds with the Mertens value, which is originally characterized in an axiomatic way (Mertens, 1988), whereas we provide an asymptotic argument. ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{methodology}} for financial and insurance operational <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> estimation is pro-posed. It {{is based on}} using the finite time probability of (non) ruin as an operational risk measure, under a general ruin probability model, according to which operational losses may have any joint (dependent) discrete or continuous distribution, and the function, describing the accumulation of <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> may be any nondecreasing, positive real function hHtL. The probability of nonruin is explicitly expressed using closed form expressions, derived by Ignatov and Kaishev (2000, 2004) and Ignatov Kaishev and Krachunov (2001) and by setting it to a high enough preassigned value, say 0. 99, {{it is possible to}} obtain not just a value for the capital charge but a (dynamic) <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation strategy hHtL. In view of its generality, the proposed methodology is capable of accommodating any (heavy tailed) distributions, such as the Generalized Pareto Distribution, the Lognormal distribution the g-and-h distribution and the GB 2 distribution. Applying our methodology on numerical examples, we demonstrate that dependence in the loss severities may have a dra-matic effect on the estimated <b>risk</b> <b>capital.</b> In addition we also show that one and the same high enough survival probability may be achieved by different <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> accumulation strategies one of which may possibly be preferable to accumulating capital just linearly, as has been assumed by Embrechts et al. (2004). The proposed methodology takes into account also the effect of insurance on operational losses, in which case it is proposed to take the probability of joint survival of the financial institution and the insurance provider as a joint operational risk measure. The <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> allocation strategy is then obtained {{in such a way that}} the probability of joint survival is equal to a preassigned high enough value, say 99. 9 %...|$|R

It is assumed that the insurer’s objective is to maximize shareholder value under a solvency constraint imposed by a regulatory authority. In a one period model of a regulated market where the required solvency level is fixed, an insurer can maintain this level by two control variables: reinsurance and <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> supplied by shareholders. Two alternatives are considered in the paper. In the first one (conservative model) the required <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> is determined {{at the beginning of}} the period and does not depend on the reinsurance decision. In the second model insurers can reduce the required minimal level of the <b>risk</b> <b>capital</b> taking into account the purchase of reinsurance.
