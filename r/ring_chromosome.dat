25|$|In the {{majority}} of cases where monosomy occurs, the X chromosome comes from the mother. This may be due to a nondisjunction in the father. Meiotic errors that lead to the production of X with p arm deletions or abnormal Y chromosomes are also mostly found in the father.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Ring {{chromosomes}} {{are often}} associated with abnormal phenotypes because of loss of genomic material at one or both ends. In some cases no deletion has been detected and the abnormal phenotype {{has been attributed to}} mitotic ring instability. We investigated 33 different <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in patients with phenotypic abnormalities by array based comparative genomic hybridisation (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). RESULTS: In seven cases we found not only the expected terminal deletion but also a contiguous duplication. FISH analysis in some of these cases demonstrated that the duplication was inverted. Thus these <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> derived through a classical inv dup del rearrangement consisting of a deletion and an inverted duplication. DISCUSSION: Inv dup del rearrangements have been reported for several chromosomes, but hardly ever in <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Our findings highlight a new mechanism for the formation of some <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and show that inv dup del rearrangements may be stabilised not only through telomere healing and telomere capture but also through circularisation. This type of mechanism must be kept in mind when evaluating possible genotype-phenotype correlations in <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> since in these cases: (1) the deletion may be larger or smaller than first estimated based {{on the size of the}} ring, with a different impact on the phenotype; and (2) the associated duplication will in general cause further phenotypic anomalies and might confuse the genotype-phenotype correlation. Moreover, these findings explain some phenotypic peculiarities which previously were attributed to a wide phenotypic variation or hidden mosaicism related to the instability of the ring...|$|R

40|$|We have {{performed}} experiments using the WIL 2 -NS human B lymphoblastoid cell line and primary human lymphocytes to: (i) determine {{the importance of}} including measurements of nucleoplasmic bridges (NPB) in the cyto-kinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay; (ii) provide evidence that NPB originate from dicentric <b>chromosomes</b> and centric <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> In addition, we describe theoretical models that explain how dicentric <b>chromosomes</b> and centric <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> may result {{in the formation of}} NPB at anaphase. The results with WIL 2 -NS showed {{that it was possible to}} distinguish genotoxic effects induced by different oxidizing agents in terms of the NPB/micro-nucleus frequency ratio. The results with lymphocytes indicated a strong correlation: (i) between NPB, centric <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and dicentric chromosomes in metaphases (r> 0. 93, P 0. 93, P < 0. 0001). The dose–response curves with γ-rays were very similar for NPB, <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and dicentric chromosomes, as were the dose–response curves for MNi, acentric rings and fragments. However, not all acentric chromosomes and dicentric chromosomes/ centric rings were converted to MNi and NPB respectively, depending on the dose of radiation. Preliminary data, using FISH, suggest that NPB often represent DNA from a structural rearrangement involving only one or two homo-logous chromosomes. The results from this study validate the inclusion of NPB in the CBMN assay which provides a valuable measure of chromosome breakage/rearrangement that was otherwise not available in the micronucleus assay. The CBMN assay allows NPB measurement to be achieved reliably because inhibition of cytokinesis prevents the loss of NPB that would otherwise occur if cells were allowed to divide...|$|R
40|$|Acquired <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{have been}} found in most types of human neoplasia, with a {{frequency}} approaching 10 % in malignant mesenchymal tumours. In this study, the composition and dynamics of <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> were analysed in eight cases of acute myelogenous leukaemia, 17 solid tumours, and five cases with constitutional rings. Chromosomal banding and fluorescence in situ hybridisation were performed to determine the content and the structural heterogeneity of the rings. Telomeric repeats were detected using peptide nucleic acid probes or primed in situ labelling, whereas centromeric activity was evaluated by detection of kinetochore proteins. Mitotic instability was assessed by the frequency of anaphase bridges. The results suggest that human <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> can be structurally and functionally divided into two categories. In the first of these, size variation is minimal and rearrangement at cell division is uncommon. The majority of such rings contain subtelomeric sequences. Constitutional <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and most <b>rings</b> in leukaemias belong to this group, whereas only a few mesenchymal tumours exhibit rings of this type. The second category consists of rings with amplified sequences, primarily from chromosome 12, characteristically occurring in atypical lipomatous tumours and other subtypes of low or borderline malignant mesenchymal neoplasms. Variation in size and number is extensive, and breakage-fusion-bridge events occur at a high frequency. Abnormalities in pericentromeric sequences are common and, in some cases, kinetochores assemble in the absence of alphoid DNA. We conclude that {{it is not only the}} ring structure per se or the neoplastic nature of the host cell that determines ring instability, but probably also the functional role of the genes carried in the ring...|$|R

40|$|The severe {{phenotype}} {{of human}} females whose karyotype includes tiny <b>ring</b> X <b>chromosomes</b> has {{been attributed to}} the inability of the small <b>ring</b> X <b>chromosome</b> to inactivate. The XIST locus is expressed only from the inactive X chromosome, resides at the putative X inactivation center, and is considered a prime player in the initiation of mammalian X dosage compensation. Using PCR, Southern blot analysis, and in situ hybridization, we have looked for the presence of the XIST locus in tiny <b>ring</b> X <b>chromosomes</b> from eight females who have multiple congenital malformations and severe mental retardation. Our studies reveal heterogeneity within this group; some rings lack the XIST locus, while others have sequences homologous to probes for XIST. However, in the latter, the locus is either not expressed or negligibly expressed, based on reverse transcription-PCR analysis. Therefore, what these tiny <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> have in common is a level of XIST transcription comparable to an active X. As XIST transcription is an indicator of X chromosome inactivity, the absence of XIST transcription strongly suggests that tiny <b>ring</b> X <b>chromosomes</b> in females with severe phenotypes are mutants in the X chromosome inactivation pathway and that the inability of these rings to inactivate is responsible for the severe phenotypes...|$|R

Multicolor single-copy FISH analysis of metaphase cells from six high-grade tumors showed that extra 12 p material either occurred together with MDM 2 in <b>ring</b> <b>chromosomes</b> or was scattered over the genome as a result of complex structural rearrangements. Most tumors (8 / 10) not containing amplification of the assessed chromosome 12 loci exhibited a nondiploid pattern at evaluation with probes for centromeric alpha satellite sequences.

40|$|Ring {{chromosomes}} {{and small}} supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMC) are enigmatic types of derivative chromosomes, {{in which the}} telomeres are thought to {{play a crucial role}} in their formation and stabilization.

Additionally, telomeric signals were detectable at both ends of centric and neocentric sSMC with inverted duplication shape, as well as in complex sSMC. Apart from that, generally both ring- and centric minute-shaped sSMC did not present telomeric sequences neither detectable by FISH nor by a second protein-directed immunohistochemical approach. However, the fact that telomeres are absent does not automatically mean that the sSMC has a ring shape, as often deduced in the previous literature. Overall, the results obtained by FISH studies directed against telomeres need to be checked carefully by other approaches.
