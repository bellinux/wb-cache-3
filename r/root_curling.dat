40|$|Protein {{phosphatase}} 2 A (PP 2 A), a heterotrimeric serine/threonine-specific protein phosphatase, comprises a catalytic C subunit and {{two distinct}} regulatory subunits, A and B. The RCN 1 gene encodes {{one of three}} A regulatory subunits in Arabidopsis thaliana. A T-DNA insertion mutation at this locus impairs <b>root</b> <b>curling,</b> seedling organ elongation and apical hypocotyl hook formation. We have used in vivo and in vitro assays to gauge {{the impact of the}} rcn 1 mutation on PP 2 A activity in seedlings. PP 2 A activity is decreased in extracts from rcn 1 mutant seedlings, and this decrease is not due to a reduction in catalytic subunit expression. Roots of mutant seedlings exhibit increased sensitivity to the phosphatase inhibitors okadaic acid and cantharidin in organ elongation assays. Shoots of dark-grown, but not light-grown seedlings also show increased inhibitor sensitivity. Furthermore, cantharidin treatment of wild-type seedlings mimics the rcn 1 defect in <b>root</b> <b>curling,</b> root waving and hypocotyl hook formation assays. In roots of wild-type seedlings, RCN 1 mRNA is expressed at high levels in root tips, and accumulates to lower levels in the pericycle and lateral root primordia. In shoots, RCN 1 is expressed in the apical hook and the basal, rapidly elongating cells in etiolated hypocotyls, and in the shoot meristem and leaf primordia of light-grown seedlings. Our results show that the wild-type RCN 1 -encoded A subunit functions as a positive regulator of the PP 2 A holoenzyme, increasing activity towards substrates involved in organ elongation and differential cell elongation responses such as <b>root</b> <b>curling...</b>|$|E
40|$|Directional root {{expansion}} {{is governed by}} nutrient gradients, positive gravitropism and hydrotropism, negative phototropism and thigmotropism, as well as endogenous oscillations in the growth trajectory (circumnutation). Null mutations in phylogenetically related Arabidopsis thaliana genes MILDEW RESISTANCE LOCUS O 4 (MLO 4) and MLO 11, encoding heptahelical, plasma membrane–localized proteins predominantly expressed in the root tip, result in aberrant root thigmomorphogenesis. mlo 4 and mlo 11 mutant plants show anisotropic, chiral root expansion manifesting as tightly curled root patterns upon contact with solid surfaces. The defect in mlo 4 and mlo 11 mutants is nonadditive and dependent on light and nutrients. Genetic epistasis experiments demonstrate that the mutant phenotype is independently modulated by the Gβ subunit of the heterotrimeric G-protein complex. Analysis of expressed chimeric MLO 4 /MLO 2 proteins revealed that the C-terminal domain of MLO 4 is necessary but not sufficient for MLO 4 action in root thigmomorphogenesis. The expression of the auxin efflux carrier fusion, PIN 1 -green fluorescent protein, the pattern of auxin-induced gene expression, and acropetal as well as basipetal auxin transport are altered at the root tip of mlo 4 mutant seedlings. Moreover, addition of auxin transport inhibitors or the loss of EIR 1 /AGR 1 /PIN 2 function abolishes <b>root</b> <b>curling</b> of mlo 4, mlo 11, and wild-type seedlings. These results demonstrate that the exaggerated <b>root</b> <b>curling</b> phenotypes of the mlo 4 and mlo 11 mutants depend on auxin gradients and suggest that MLO 4 and MLO 11 cofunction as modulators of touch-induced root tropism...|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of soybean (Glycine max L. Merr. cv Maple Arrow) seeds to dehydration changed during germination. Seeds were tolerant of dehydration to 10 % moisture if dried at 6 hours of imbibition, but were susceptible to dehydration injury if dried at 36 hours of imbibition. Dehydration injury appeared as loss of germination, slower {{growth rates of}} isolated axes, hypocotyl and <b>root</b> <b>curling,</b> and altered membrane permeability. Increased electrolyte leakage due to dehydration treatment was observed only from isolated axes but not from cotyledons, suggesting that cotyledons are more tolerant of dehydration. The transition from a dehydration-tolerant to a dehydration-susceptible state coincided with radicle elongation. However, the prevention of cell elongation by osmotic treatment in polyethylene glycol (− 6 bars) or imbibition in 20 micrograms per milliliter cycloheximide did not prevent the loss of dehydration tolerance suggesting that neither cell elongation nor cytoplasmic protein synthesis {{was responsible for the}} change in {{sensitivity of}} soybean seeds to dehydration. Furthermore, the rate of dehydration or rate of rehydration did not alter the response to the dehydration stress...|$|E
40|$|A 3. 2 kb {{fragment}} of DNA cloned from Rhizobium leguminosarum {{has been shown}} to contain the genes necessary for the induction of <b>root</b> hair <b>curling,</b> the first observed step in the infection of leguminous plants by R. leguminosarum. The DNA sequence of this region has been determined and three open reading frames were identified: genes corresponding to these open reading frames have been called nodA, nodB and nodC and are transcribed in that order. Mutations within the nodC gene completely blocked <b>root</b> hair <b>curling.</b> However, a subcloned fragment containing only the nodC gene did not induce normal <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> (although some branching was observed), indicating that the nodA and B genes may also be required for normal <b>root</b> hair <b>curling.</b> From an analysis of the predicted amino acid sequences of the nodAB and C genes it appeared unlikely that their products are secreted; therefore it is concluded that the induction of <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> could be due to a secreted metabolite...|$|R

40|$|Auxin and {{cytokinin}} (CK) {{are both}} important hormones involved in {{many aspects of}} plant growth and development. However, the details of auxin biosynthesis and the interaction between auxin and CK are still unclear. Isolation and characterization of an auxin deficient mutant cytokinin induced <b>root</b> <b>curling</b> 2 (ckrc 2) in this work reveal that CKRC 2 encodes a previously identified member of YUCCA (YUC) flavin monooxygenase-like proteins (YUC 8). Our results show that, like other YUCs, CKRC 2 /YUC 8 is a rate-limiting enzyme for catalyzing the conversion of indole- 3 -pyruvic acid (IPyA) to indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA), acting downstream of CKRC 1 /TAA 1 in the IPyA pathway. Here we show that the transcription of both CKRC 1 /TAA and CKRC 2 /YUC 8 can be induced by CK and that the phytochrome-interacting factor 4 (PIF 4) is required for this upregulation. Transcription of PIF 4 itself is induced by CK via the AHKs-ARR 1 / 12 signalling pathway. These results indicate that PIF 4 plays {{an essential role in}} mediating the regulatory effect of CK on the transcriptions of CKRC 1 and CKRC 2 genes in the IPyA pathway of auxin biosynthesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{phytohormone}} auxin controls {{processes such as}} cell elongation, {{root hair}} development and root branching. Tropisms, growth curvatures triggered by gravity, light and touch, are also auxin-mediated responses. Auxin is synthesized in the shoot apex and transported through the stem, but the molecular mechanism of auxin transport is not well understood. Naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) and other inhibitors of auxin transport block tropic curvature responses and inhibit root and shoot elongation. We have isolated a novel Arabidopsis thaliana mutant designated roots curl in NPA (rcn 1). Mutant seedlings exhibit altered responses to NPA in <b>root</b> <b>curling</b> and hypocotyl elongation. Auxin efflux in mutant seedlings displays increased sensitivity to NPA. The rcn 1 mutation was transferred-DNA (T-DNA) tagged and sequences flanking the T-DNA insert were cloned. Analysis of the RCN 1 cDNA reveals that the T-DNA insertion disrupts a gene for the regulatory A subunit of protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A-A). The RCN 1 gene rescues the rcn 1 mutant phenotype and also complements the temperature-sensitive phenotype of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PP 2 A-A mutation, tpd 3 - 1. These data implicate protein phosphatase 2 A in the regulation of auxin transport in Arabidopsis...|$|E
40|$|Root {{development}} {{is sensitive to}} environmental stimuli. We have recently reported that the light signal could promote the helical growth of seminal roots and drive the wavy root morphology in rice (Oryza sativa L.) young seedlings. The light-stimulated wavy roots were mostly performed in indica-type rice varieties (e. g., Taichung Native 1; TCN 1) but not in japonica rice (e. g., Tainung 67; TNG 67). Here, we demonstrated that the light-driven circumutation trajectory of TCN 1 seminal roots could be changed if the seedling roots were grown in the medium containing high concentration of Phytagel. The data showed the root morphology would be modulated from wavy to curling when the Phytagel concentration was increased to 2 %. However, the touch-stimulated curling root phenotype could not be performed in dark. In addition, the touch-induced curling roots were not appeared in the TNG 67 rice cultivar. Although touch stimuli could not induce wavy/curling root phenotype in dark, it could modify the light-promoted helical growth to conduct curling roots in TCN 1 rice seedlings. Thus, {{it was suggested that}} there is a crosstalk mechanism between touching-induced <b>root</b> <b>curling</b> and light-stimulated root waving...|$|E
40|$|During {{analysis}} of early {{events in the}} infection and nodulation of Vicia hirsuta roots inoculated with normal and mutant strains of Rhizobium leguminosarum and strains containing cloned nodulation (nod) genes, a number of novel observations were made. (i) Alternating zones of <b>curled</b> and straight <b>root</b> hairs were seen on roots of V. hirsuta inoculated with the wild-type strain of R. leguminosarum. This phasing of <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> was not seen if plants were grown under continuous light or continuous dark conditions. (ii) Reduced nodulation and delayed nodule initiation was observed with a strain carrying a Tn 5 mutation in the nodE gene. In addition the phased <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> was absent, and <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> was observed {{along the length of}} the root. (iii) The nodABC genes cloned on a multicopy plasmid in a wild-type strain inhibited nodulation but induced a continuous <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> response. Those few nodules that eventually formed were found to contain bacteria which had lost the plasmid carrying the nodABC genes. (iv) With a strain of Rhizobium cured of its indigenous symbiotic plasmid, but containing the cloned nodABCDEF genes, continuous <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> on V. hirsuta was observed. However, no infection threads were observed, and surprisingly, it did appear that initial stages of nodule development occurred. Observations of thin sections of these early developing nodules indicated that early nodule meristematic divisions may have occurred but that no bacteria were found within the nodules and no infection threads were observed either within the nodule bumps or within any of the root hairs. It was concluded that for normal infections to occur, precise regulation of the nod genes is required and that overexpression of the <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> genes inhibits the normal infection process...|$|R
40|$|A first visible {{step in the}} {{nodulation}} of legumes by Rhizobium spp. is the deformation and <b>curling</b> of <b>root</b> hairs. We {{have identified}} and cloned DNA sequences encoding this function from two strains of Rhizobium japonicum (USDA 122 and USDA 110) with a weakly homologous probe from Rhizobium meliloti. <b>Root</b> hair <b>curling</b> encoded by the cloned DNA fragments was examined on soybeans (Glycine soja) after conjugative transfer of these sequences in broad-host-range vectors to various bacterial genera. Pseudomonas putida gave unambiguous expression of the <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> genes. This enabled us to identify the 8. 7 -kilobase EcoRI fragments encoding <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> from each strain. The phenotypes encoded by the plasmids pBS 1 (derived from strain USDA 122) and pBS 2 (derived from strain USDA 110) are distinct and represent a phenotype characteristic of their parent R. japonicum strains. Subclones of pBS 1 and pBS 2 were generated in single and multicopy vectors, and their expression was analyzed in P. putida. We established that a 4. 2 -kilobase internal Sa/I fragment of pBS 1 and a 3. 5 -kilobase SstI -EcoRI fragment of pBS 2 are sufficient to confer <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> on soybeans...|$|R
40|$|The early {{events in}} the alfalfa-Rhizobium meliloti {{symbiosis}} include deformation of epidermal root hairs and the approximately concurrent stimulation of cell dedifferentiation and cell division in the root inner cortex. These early steps have been studied previously by analysis of R. meliloti mutants. Bacterial strains mutated in nodABC, for example, fail to stimulate either <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> or cell division {{events in the}} plant host, whereas exopolysaccharide (exo) mutants of R. meliloti stimulate host cell division but the resulting nodules are uninfected. As a further approach to understanding early symbiotic interactions, we have investigated the phenotype of a non-nodulating alfalfa mutant, MnNC- 1008 (NN) (referred to as MN- 1008). Nodulating and non-nodulating plants were inoculated with wild-type R. meliloti and scored for <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> and cell divisions. MN- 1008 {{was found to be}} defective in both responses. Mutant plants inoculated with Exo- bacteria also showed no cell division response. Therefore, the genetic function mutated in MN- 1008 is required for both <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> and cell division, as is true for the R. meliloti nodABC genes. These observations support the model that the distinct cellular processes of <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> and cell division are triggered by related mechanisms or components, or are causally linked...|$|R
40|$|Raising {{the level}} of {{extracellular}} ATP to mM concentrations {{similar to those found}} inside cells can block gravitropism of Arabidopsis roots. When plants are grown in Murashige and Skoog medium supplied with 1 mM ATP, their roots grow horizontally instead of growing straight down. Medium with 2 mM ATP induces <b>root</b> <b>curling,</b> and 3 mM ATP stimulates lateral root growth. When plants are transferred to medium containing exogenous ATP, the gravity response is reduced or in some cases completely blocked by ATP. Equivalent concentrations of ADP or inorganic phosphate have slight but usually statistically insignificant effects, suggesting the specificity of ATP in these responses. The ATP effects may be attributable to the disturbance of auxin distribution in roots by exogenously applied ATP, because extracellular ATP can alter the pattern of auxin-induced gene expression in DR 5 -beta-glucuronidase transgenic plants and increase the response sensitivity of plant roots to exogenously added auxin. The presence of extracellular ATP also decreases basipetal auxin transport in a dose-dependent fashion in both maize (Zea mays) and Arabidopsis roots and increases the retention of [(3) H]indole- 3 -acetic acid in root tips of maize. Taken together, these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of extracellular ATP on auxin distribution may happen at {{the level of}} auxin export. The potential role of the trans-plasma membrane ATP gradient in auxin export and plant root gravitropism is discussed...|$|E
40|$|The WAG 1 and WAG 2 {{genes of}} Arabidopsis thaliana encode protein-serine/threonine kinases that {{are closely related}} to PINOID. In order to better {{understand}} the roles of WAG 1 and WAG 2, their gene expression profiles were analyzed. Promoter fusions to the gusA reporter gene demonstrate that the spatial patterns of the WAG promoter acitivity are partially overlapping in young seedlings and mature plants. WAG 1 and WAG 2 expression was analyzed after treatment with light or exogenously applied phytohormones by RT-PCR. Expression of WAG 1 and WAG 2 is repressed by light and the plant hormone cytokinin in young seedlings. The hormones auxin, brassinolide, and gibberellin increased WAG mRNAs but the changes were subtle. In order to determine what roles WAG 1 and WAG 2 play in seedling development, a reverse genetics approach was used to study the wagl, wag 2 and wag 1 /wag 2 mutant phenotypes for clues. Although the wag mutants do not contain detectable amounts of the corresponding mRNA, they are wild type in most respects. However, wag 1 /wag 2 double mutants exhibit a pronounced wavy root phenotype when grown vertically on agar plates, a phenotype observed in wild type plants only on plates inclined to angles less than 90 °. The wag 1 and wag 2 mutants also demonstrate enhanced root waving, but to a lesser extent. The double mutant roots are more resistant to the effects of the auxin transport inhibitor N- 1 -naphthylphthalamic acid on the inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>curling.</b> Moreover, the auxin responsive reporter DR 5 :GUS is more active in wag 1 - 1 /wag 2 - 1 roots than wild type roots raising the possibility that transport of auxin is affected in the wag mutants. The wag 1 - 1 /wag 2 - 1 mutant was crossed with mutants affected in gravitropism, auxin transport, auxin signaling, and auxin biosynthesis. From these studies, a model was proposed to describe how these processes interact during root waving. ...|$|E
40|$|The Mildew Locus O (MLO) protein {{family is}} best-known for its {{prominent}} role in the plant-powdery mildew interaction. Loss-of-function mutation of barley Mlo, respective wheat TaMlo 1 orthologues, Arabidopsis AtMLO 2, AtMLO 6 and AtMLO 12, and of tomato SlMlo 1 (to name but a few) results in durable broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew across these diverse plant species. However, the MLO protein family is more complex. In Arabidopsis, for instance, 15 MLO proteins are present, {{and in addition to}} the three above-mentioned MLOs, AtMLO 7 is required for proper pollen tube perception of the female gametophyte, and AtMLO 4 plus AtMLO 11 are involved in root thigmomorphogenesis and respective loss-of-function mutations lead to an aberrant <b>root</b> <b>curling</b> phenotype upon a tactile stimulus. I further investigated the diversity of the MLO family across eukaryotic species. First, I performed comprehensive phylogenetic analysis to resolve the relationship of the MLO subfamilies (clades) and to trace the origin of the MLO protein. By this work, I found that the MLO protein family likely originated in a single-celled eukaryotic organism that was the ancestor of both the plant kingdom and oomycetes, and diversified into seven MLO clades in land plants. Next, I addressed the question whether the MLO clade diversity reflects functional diversity. To this end, I explored the yet uncharacterized MLO clades II and VI in Arabidopsis based on available expression data and co-expression networks, i. e. AtMLO 1 and AtMLO 15 (clade II) for root hair development and AtMLO 3 (clade VI, closely related to AtMLO 2) for biotic stress response to various pathogens of fungal, oomycete and bacterial origin. However, I could not identify aberrant phenotypes in respective T-DNA insertion mutants. Furthermore, I characterized clade III (AtMLO 5, AtMLO 7, AtMLO 8, AtMLO 9, and AtMLO 10) single mutants and various mutant combinations thereof for fertility and analyzed mlo 7 and mlo 8 mutants for abiotic and biotic stress responses. Here, I found that only mlo 7 mutants are clearly affected in fertility (seed number) by 10 - 20 %, while mlo 8 mutants might be somewhat more susceptible to the adapted pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). Taken together, the data suggests that the MLO clades are functionally distinct, with potential further specialization within some of the clades. Additionally, I investigated the role of further plant MLO proteins in the interaction with powdery mildews. Here, I used Arabidopsis mlo 2 mlo 6 mlo 12 triple mutant plants that heterologously express one of four selected rose (Rosa hybrida) MLOs (RhMLO 1 -RhMLO 4) and found that RhMLO 1 and potentially RhMLO 3 and RhMLO 4 partially restore susceptibility to the powdery mildew fungus Golovinomyces orontii. A TALEN- and Cas 9 -based proof-of-principle approach to introduce powdery mildew resistance by targeted gene knock-out of MLO genes in barley and Arabidopsis was not successful. Finally, I generated and characterized a barley powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei, Bgh) isolate, termed Super-virulent K 1 (SK 1), that is partially virulent on mlo mutant plants. I quantified the extent of this limited virulence in comparison with the mlo-avirulent parent isolate Bgh K 1 and demonstrated that Bgh SK 1 shows about 20 - 30 % penetration success on barley mlo mutants and successfully completes its life cycle on this genotype, as evidenced by the formation of macroscopically visible colonies. A clear difference between the two fungal isolates on the non-hosts wheat and Arabidopsis was not found. Interestingly, Bgh SK 1 is hyper-virulent on mlo- 5 ror 1 and mlo- 5 ror 2 double mutants (ror 1 and ror 2 are suppressors of mlo resistance). On these double mutants penetration rates reach levels like on the wild type Mlo genotype cultivar Ingrid, while Bgh K 1 only shows 10 - 20 % entry rate (ΔK 1 /SK 145 %). I performed whole transcript shotgut sequencing (RNAseq) analysis of both isolates on both Ingrid and mlo as host plants at four time points (6, 12, 18, and 24 hours post inoculation (hpi)) to uncover the molecular basis for this phenotype. In preliminary analysis of the data I uncovered > 600 genes being at least 2 -fold upregulated in Bgh SK 1 on barley mlo at 6 hpi compared to wild type as the host. The data suggests that Bgh SK 1 overcomes mlo resistance by breaking a pre-penetration resistance pathway distinct from but potentially related to pathways involving Ror 1 or Ror 2, coinciding with significant transcriptomic adaptations at early infection stages to the new host barley mlo...|$|E

These mutant strains were derived from the wild-type R. trifolii ANU 843 and were unable to induce normal <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> (Hac- phenotype) or nodulation response (Nod- phenotype) in clover plants. These strains included several transposon Tn 5 -induced Nod-mutants, strain ANU 871, which possesses a 40 to 50 kilobase deletion of the resident Sym plasmid, and strain ANU 845 which is missing the Sym plasmid (pSym-). Strains ANU 845 (pSym-) containing either plasmid pRt 150 or pBR 1 AN were also used.

40|$|Rhizobia can infect {{roots of}} host legume plants and induce new organs called nodules, {{in which they}} fix {{atmospheric}} nitrogen.

40|$|Infection of alfalfa with Rhizobium meliloti exo mutants {{deficient}} in exopolysaccharide results in abnormal root nodules that are devoid of bacteria {{and fail to}} fix nitrogen. Here we report further characterization of these abnormal nodules. Tightly <b>curled</b> <b>root</b> hairs or shepherd's crooks were found after inoculation with Rm 1021 -derived exo mutants, but curling was delayed compared with wild-type Rm 1021. Infection threads were initiated in <b>curled</b> <b>root</b> hairs by mutants {{as well as by}} wild-type R. meliloti, but the exo mutant-induced threads aborted within the peripheral cells of the developing nodule. Also, nodules elicited by Rm 1021 -derived exo mutants were more likely to develop on secondary roots than on the primary root. In contrast with wild-type R. meliloti-induced nodules, the exo mutant-induced nodules lacked a well defined apical meristem, presumably due to the abortion of the infection threads. The relationship of these findings to the physiology of nodule development is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The gaseous hormone {{ethylene}} {{is one of}} {{the master}} regulators of development and physiology throughout the plant life cycle. Ethylene biosynthesis is stringently regulated to permit maintenance of low levels during most phases of vegetative growth but to allow for rapid peaks of high production at developmental transitions and under stress conditions. In most tissues ethylene is a negative regulator of cell expansion, thus low basal levels of ethylene biosynthesis in dark-grown seedlings are critical for optimal cell expansion during early seedling development. The committed steps in ethylene biosynthesis are performed by the enzymes 1 -aminocyclopropane 1 -carboxylate synthase (ACS) and 1 -aminocyclopropane 1 -carboxylate oxidase (ACO). The abundance of different ACS enzymes is tightly regulated both by transcriptional control and by post-translational modifications and proteasome-mediated degradation. Here we show that specific ACS isozymes are targets for regulation by protein phosphatase 2 A (PP 2 A) during Arabidopsis thaliana seedling growth and that reduced PP 2 A function causes increased ACS activity in the <b>roots</b> <b>curl</b> in 1 -N-naphthylphthalamic acid 1 (rcn 1) mutant. Genetic analysis reveals that ethylene overproduction in PP 2 A-deficient plants requires ACS 2 and ACS 6, genes that encode ACS proteins known to be stabilized by phosphorylation, and proteolytic turnover of the ACS 6 protein is retarded when PP 2 A activity is reduced. We find that PP 2 A and ACS 6 proteins associate in seedlings and that RCN 1 -containing PP 2 A complexes specifically dephosphorylate a C-terminal ACS 6 phosphopeptide. These results suggest that PP 2 A-dependen...|$|R
40|$|In Rhizobium meliloti 2011 {{nodulation}} genes (nod) {{required to}} nodulate specifically alfalfa {{are located on}} a pSym megaplasmid. Nod- derivatives carrying large pSym deletions were isolated. By complementation of these strains with in vivo- and in vitro-constructed episomes containing pSym of sequences and introduction of these episomes into Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we show (i) that from a region of pSym of about 360 kilobases, genes required for specific alfalfa nodulation are clustered in a DNA fragment of less than 30 kilobases and (ii) that a nod region located between nifHDK and the common nod genes is absolutely required for alfalfa nodulation and controls the specificity of <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> and nodule organogenesis initiation...|$|R
40|$|The <b>roots</b> <b>curl</b> in {{naphthylphthalamic acid}} 1 (rcn 1) mutant of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) has altered auxin transport, gravitropism, and {{ethylene}} response, providing {{an opportunity to}} analyze the interplay between ethylene and auxin in control of seedling growth. Roots of rcn 1 seedlings were previously shown to have altered auxin transport, growth, and gravitropism, while rcn 1 hypocotyl elongation exhibited enhanced ethylene response. We have characterized auxin transport and gravitropism phenotypes of rcn 1 hypocotyls and have explored the roles of auxin and ethylene in controlling these phenotypes. As in roots, auxin transport is increased in etiolated rcn 1 hypocotyls. Hypocotyl gravity response is accelerated, although overall elongation is reduced, in etiolated rcn 1 hypocotyls. Etiolated, but not light grown, rcn 1 seedlings also overproduce ethylene, and mutations conferring ethylene insensitivity restore normal hypocotyl elongation to rcn 1. Auxin transport is unaffected by treatment with the ethylene precursor 1 -aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid in etiolated hypocotyls of wild-type and rcn 1 seedlings. Surprisingly, the ethylene insensitive 2 - 1 (ein 2 - 1) and ein 2 - 5 mutations dramatically reduce gravitropic bending in hypocotyls. However, the ethylene resistant 1 - 3 (etr 1 - 3) mutation does not significantly affect hypocotyl gravity response. Furthermore, neither the etr 1 nor the ein 2 mutation abrogates the accelerated gravitropism observed in rcn 1 hypocotyls, indicating that both wild-type gravity response and enhanced gravity response in rcn 1 do not require an intact ethylene-signaling pathway. We therefore conclude that the RCN 1 protein affects overall hypocotyl elongation via negative regulation of ethylene synthesis in etiolated seedlings, and that RCN 1 and EIN 2 modulate hypocotyl gravitropism and ethylene responses through independent pathways...|$|R
40|$|Rhizobium meliloti Rm 1021 {{must be able}} to {{synthesize}} succinoglycan in order to invade successfully the nodules which it elicits on alfalfa and to establish an effective nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. Using R. meliloti cells that express green fluorescent protein (GFP), we have examined the nature of the symbiotic deficiency of exo mutants that are defective or altered in succinoglycan production. Our observations indicate that an exoY mutant, which does not produce succinoglycan, is symbiotically defective because it cannot initiate the formation of infection threads. An exoZ mutant, which produces succinoglycan without the acetyl modification, forms nitrogen-fixing nodules on plants, but it exhibits a reduced efficiency in the initiation and elongation of infection threads. An exoH mutant, which produces symbiotically nonfunctional high-molecular-weight succinoglycan that lacks the succinyl modification, cannot form extended infection threads. Infection threads initiate at a reduced rate and then abort before they reach the base of the root hairs. Overproduction of succinoglycan by the exoS 96 ::Tn 5 mutant does not reduce the efficiency of infection thread initiation and elongation, but it does significantly reduce the ability of this mutant to colonize the <b>curled</b> <b>root</b> hairs, which is the first step of the invasion process. The exoR 95 ::Tn 5 mutant, which overproduces succinoglycan to an even greater extent than the exoS 96 ::Tn 5 mutant, has completely lost its ability to colonize the <b>curled</b> <b>root</b> hairs. These new observations lead us to propose that succinoglycan is required for both the initiation and elongation of infection threads during nodule invasion and that excess production of succinoglycan interferes with the ability of the rhizobia to colonize <b>curled</b> <b>root</b> hairs...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of two exopolysaccharide-deficient mutants of Rhizobium leguminosarum, RBL 5808 and RBL 5812, {{revealed}} independent Tn 5 transposon integrations in {{a single}} gene, designated exo 5. As judged from structural and functional homology, this gene encodes a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase responsible for the oxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid. A mutation in exo 5 affects all glucuronic acid-containing polysaccharides and, consequently, all galacturonic acid-containing polysaccharides. Exo 5 -deficient rhizobia do not produce extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) or capsular polysaccharide (CPS), both of which contain glucuronic acid. Carbohydrate composition analysis and nuclear magnetic resonance studies demonstrated that EPS and CPS from the parent strain have very similar structures. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecules produced by the mutant strains are deficient in galacturonic acid, which is normally present in the core and lipid A portions of the LPS. The sensitivity of exo 5 mutant rhizobia to hydrophobic compounds shows {{the involvement of the}} galacturonic acid residues in the outer membrane structure. Nodulation studies with Vicia sativa subsp. nigra showed that exo 5 mutant rhizobia are impaired in successful infection thread colonization. This is caused by strong agglutination of EPS-deficient bacteria in the <b>root</b> hair <b>curl.</b> <b>Root</b> infection could be restored by simultaneous inoculation with a Nod factor-defective strain which retained the ability to produce EPS and CPS.

40|$|Water-tolerant legumes provide {{bacteria}} {{with special}} ways of invading roots to establish N- 2 -fixing symbiosis upon flooding. On well-aerated <b>roots,</b> <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> (RHC) invasion is used, whereas, under hydroponic conditions, rhizobia enter the cortex through cracks at lateral root bases (LRBs). Here, we compare the physiological and anatomical traits of these invasions. During waterlogging, accumulating ethylene inhibits the epidermal stages of RHC invasion. LRB invasion circumvents this step by direct colonization of the cortical tissue. By avoiding the epidermis for bacterial entry under hydroponic conditions, the stringent nodulation (Nod) factor perception {{systems that are}} active within the epidermis are not needed. Consequently, LRB invasion might be useful for analysing the requirement for Nod factor perception and other signal transduction systems downstream of the epidermis...|$|R

In aerated soils, the bacteria enter via the <b>root</b> hair <b>curling</b> mechanism. Submergence prevents this epidermal invasion by accumulation of inhibiting concentrations of ethylene and, under these conditions, the bacterial colonization occurs via intercellular cortical infection at lateral root bases. The transcriptome of both invasion ways was compared by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Clusters of gene tags were identified that were specific for either epidermal or cortical invasion or were shared by both. The data {{provide insight into}} mechanisms that control infection and illustrate that entry via the epidermis adds a layer of complexity to rhizobial invasion...|$|R
50|$|Nodules are growths on {{the roots}} of leguminous plants where the {{bacteria}} reside. The plant roots secrete amino acids and sugars into the rhizosphere. The rhizobia move toward the roots and attach to the root hairs. The plant then releases flavanoids, which induce the expression of nod genes within the bacteria. The expression of these genes results {{in the production of}} enzymes called nod factors that initiate <b>root</b> hair <b>curling.</b> During this process, the rhizobia are curled up with the root hair. The rhizobia penetrate the root hair cells with an infection thread that grows through the root hair into the main root. This causes the infected cells to divide and form a nodule. The rhizobia can now begin nitrogen fixation.|$|R
