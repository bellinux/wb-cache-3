Adult enthusiasts tend to use {{a wider range of}} high-performance motors that are better suited to powering large models. During Meccano's heyday, the electric motors available were universal wound (for use on DC or AC supplies) that were called the MECCANO MOTOR M-Series in the 1970s; these electric motors ranged from 3 volt to the E20R 20 volt Electric <b>Reversible</b> <b>Motor</b> depending on the motor model. They became better known as the M1, M3 and M5 Electric Motors. Particularly well known were the E020, E20R and E15R universal motors, issued after the Second World War. These could be run from a mains Meccano Transformer No.T20 1 AMP 20 Volts Set or, {{in the case of the}} E15R, a 12 V car battery. Earlier there had been short-lived (and potentially lethal) mains motors designed for DC mains with a domestic lightbulb in series to drop the voltage, followed by motors of the post-War pattern but wound for 4.5 or 6 V DC and suited to lead/acid accumulator power. These, as well as the latter accumulator are now rare if in good condition.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{statistics}} of steps and dwell times in <b>reversible</b> molecular <b>motors</b> {{differ from those}} of cycle completion in enzyme kinetics.

40|$|SummaryParkinson’s disease (PD) is a {{neurodegenerative}} disease caused {{by the loss of}} dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. PARK 2 mutations cause early-onset forms of PD. PARK 2 encodes an E 3 ubiquitin ligase, Parkin, that can selectively translocate to dysfunctional mitochondria to promote their removal by autophagy. However, Parkin knockout (KO) mice do not display signs of neurodegeneration. To assess Parkin function in vivo, we utilized a mouse model that accumulates dysfunctional mitochondria caused by an accelerated generation of mtDNA mutations (Mutator mice). In the absence of Parkin, dopaminergic neurons in Mutator mice degenerated causing an L-DOPA <b>reversible</b> <b>motor</b> deficit. Other neuronal populations were unaffected. Phosphorylated ubiquitin was increased in the brains of Mutator mice, indicating PINK 1 -Parkin activation. Parkin loss caused mitochondrial dysfunction and affected the pathogenicity but not the levels of mtDNA somatic mutations.

40|$|Abstract Background: Since the mid- 19 th century, {{epistaxis}} and migraine {{have been}} occasionally {{associated with each}} other. Nevertheless, we found only two cases in the contemporary medical literature. Sporadic hemiplegic migraine is a subtype of migraine with <b>reversible</b> <b>motor</b> deficits, without similar episodes in relatives. Case: We describe a 47 -year-old male {{with a history of}} migraine with a scintillating scotoma starting at the age of 20. In some of the episodes, he developed epistaxis in the resolution phase of migraine. At the age of 35, he experienced a visual aura followed by transient aphasia, left crural weakness and headache. Contralateral similar episodes occurred in the subsequent months. Neurological examination and MRI were normal. Mutations in CACNA 1 A, ATP 1 A 2, SCN 1 A and NOTCH 3 were excluded. Discussion: Three distinct aspects deserve our consideration. This is the first report of migraine-induced epistaxis involving aura; the scarcity of similar reports {{may be due to the}} lack of a guided anamnesis. The complex aura presented had a peculiar topography, inconsistent with the classical analytical neurological semiology. This may suggest that the spreading depression affects the brain bilaterally but in an uneven and elective manner. Lastly, the present report conveys that the late appearance of complex auras requires improbable interactions between environmental and endogenous conditions in individuals with a genetic predisposition...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a disease-specific measure for fatigue in patients with motor neurone disease (MND) by generating data that would fit the Rasch measurement model. Fatigue was defined as <b>reversible</b> <b>motor</b> weakness and whole-body tiredness that was predominantly brought on by muscular exertion and was partially relieved by rest. Methods: Qualitative interviews were undertaken to confirm the suitability of a previously identified set of 52 neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. Patients were recruited from five U. K. MND clinics. Questionnaires were administered during clinic or by post. A sub-sample of patients completed the questionnaire again after 2 - 4 weeks to assess test-retest validity. Exploratory factor analyses and Rasch analysis were conducted on the item set. Results: Qualitative interviews with ten MND patients confirmed the suitability of 52 previously identified neurological fatigue items as relevant to patients with MND. 298 patients consented to completing the initial questionnaire including this item set, with an additional 78 patients completing the questionnaire a second time after 4 - 6 weeks. Exploratory Factor Analysis identified five potential subscales that could be conceptualised as representing: ‘Energy’, ‘Reversible muscular weakness ’ (shortened to ‘Weakness’), ‘Concentration’, ‘Effects of heat’ and ‘Rest’. Of the original five factors, two factors ‘Energy ’ and ‘Weakness ’ met the expectations of the Rasch model...|$|E
40|$|Dengue is {{the most}} {{important}} mosquito-borne, arboviral infection found in tropical and sub-tropical climates. Clinical presentation varies from a severe flu-like illness to a potentially lethal dengue hemorrhagic fever. Dengue has been regarded as a nonneurotropic virus.

The neurological involvement in dengue virus infection includes encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, transverse myelitis, and Guillain-Barre syndrome.

40|$|We {{developed}} a novel technique that allowed reversible suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cerebellar network. We generated {{two lines of}} transgenic mice termed Tet and TeNT mice and crossed the two transgenic lines to produce the Tet/TeNT double transgenic mice. In the Tet mice, the tetracycline-controlled reverse activator (rtTA) was expressed selectively in cerebellar granule cells by the promoter function of the GABAA receptor � 6 subunit gene. In the TeNT mice, the fusion gene of tetanus neurotoxin light chain (TeNT) and enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) {{was designed to be}} induced by the interaction of doxycycline (DOX) -activated rtTA with the tetracycline-responsive promoter. The Tet/TeNT mice grew normally even after DOX treatment and exhibited a restricted DOX-dependent expression of TeNT in cerebellar granule cells. Along with this expression, TeNT proteolytically cleaved the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP 2 (also termed synaptobrevin 2) and reduced glutamate release from granule cells. Both cleavage of VAMP 2 / synaptobrevin 2 and reduction of glutamate release were reversed by removal of DOX. Among the four genotypes generated by heterozygous crossing of Tet and TeNT mice, only Tet/TeNT mice showed DOX-dependent <b>reversible</b> <b>motor</b> impairments as analyzed with fixed bar and rota-rod tests. Reversible suppression of glutamatergic neurotransmission thus can be manipulated with spatiotemporal accuracy by DOX treatment and removal.

40|$|We combine {{molecular}} simulations {{and mechanical}} modeling {{to explore the}} mechanism of energy conversion in the coupled rotary motors of F o F 1 -ATP synthase. A torsional viscoelastic model with frictional dissipation quantitatively reproduces the dynamics and energetics seen in atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of torque-driven γ-subunit rotation in the F 1 -ATPase rotary motor. The torsional elastic coefficients determined from the simulations agree with results from independent single-molecule experiments probing different segments of the γ-subunit, which resolves a long-lasting controversy. At steady rotational speeds of ∼ 1 kHz corresponding to experimental turnover, the calculated frictional dissipation of less than k B T per rotation {{is consistent with the}} high thermodynamic efficiency of the fully <b>reversible</b> <b>motor.</b> Without load, the maximum rotational speed during transitions between dwells is reached at ∼ 1 MHz. Energetic constraints dictate a unique pathway for the coupled rotations of the F o and F 1 rotary motors in ATP synthase, and explain the need for the finer stepping of the F 1 motor in the mammalian system, as seen in recent experiments. Compensating for incommensurate eightfold and threefold rotational symmetries in F o and F 1, respectively, a significant fraction of the external mechanical work is transiently stored as elastic energy in the γ-subunit.
