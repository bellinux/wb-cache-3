In order to solve the large-scale abnormal behavior data lacking problem in training process, a cloud based incremental SVM (CI-SVM) learning method is proposed. The original abnormal behavior data are first used to get the initial SVM classifier. And the larger abnormal behavior data of elderly collected by mobile devices are then gathered in cloud platform to conduct incremental training and get the new SVM classifier.

40|$|Rhythmic motions, {{regular or}} irregular, are an {{integral}} part of motor behavior both in health and in disease. Better understanding of its neural control mechanisms helps in developing methods for controlling the progression of diseases manifesting as rhythmic motions. I studied two specific aspects of rhythmic motions: bilateral coordination of hand tremors in human subjects and modular control of locomotion in invertebrates. Many types of tremors, including the physiological tremor (PT) and the essential tremor (ET) occur in limbs on both the sides of the body, with similar fundamental frequency of the oscillation. This raises the possibility that the contralateral tremors may have a common source or are otherwise coupled. However, while significant contralateral interaction is seen in these two types of tremors, only limited evidence of bilateral coherence has been shown in the previous literature. Therefore, in my study I explored the existence of a weak coupling between the left and right oscillators the may lead to intermittent bilateral coherence. I measured <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration</b> of the two hands and systematically assessed their bilateral coherence, using both stationary and non-stationary (wavelet-based) analyses methods.

Three of these subjects had been given training, before the mission, in voluntary control of these autonomic responses as a means of facilitating adaptation to space. Three of these subjects served as Controls, i. e., did not receive this training but took anti-motion sickness medication. Nearly 300 hours of flight data are summarized. These data were examined using time-series analyses, spectral analyses of heart rate variability, and analyses of variance.

We have previously reported on the design and application of 2 KHz data logging transceiver nodes, however, only one node may stream data at a time, since all nodes on the network use the same communications frequency. To overcome these limitations, second generation data logging transceivers were developed with software programmable radio frequency (RF) communications. Each node contains on-board memory (2 Mbytes), sensor excitation, instrumentation amplifiers with programmable gains & offsets, multiplexer, 16 bit A/D converter, microcontroller, and frequency agile, bi-directional, frequency shift keyed (FSK) RF serial data link. These systems are capable of continuous data transmission from 26 distinct nodes (902 - 928 MHz band, 75 kbaud). The system was demonstrated in a compelling structural monitoring application.

The {{objective of this}} study was to evaluate the effects of seat cushions on mitigating the higher frequency (> 10 Hz) multi-axis vibration associated with Navy E- 2 C Hawkeye operations. An E- 2 C crew seat was used in the laboratory during exposure to a selected operational signal. <b>Triaxial</b> <b>accelerations</b> were measured at the interface between the human and cushion (seat pan and seat back). The most pronounced effects were observed at the blade passage frequency (~ 73. 5 Hz). The highest vibration occurred at the seat pan in the fore-and-aft (X) direction of the subject (lateral direction of the aircraft). Substantial vibration was observed at the seat back in the vertical (Z) direction. Significantly lower levels of fore-and-aft (X) vibration occurred at the seat pan with all cushions as compared to the original E- 2 C cushion (P< 0. 05). The largest reduction in the X acceleration was about 40 % with a mean reduction of approximately 20 % among the cushions. The results raised questions regarding psychophysical effects and whether the vibration mitigation at the blade passage frequency is sufficient for reducing the reported symptoms...|$|R
40|$|Purpose—Determine if the {{leveling}} off (‘plateau/inverted-U’ phenomenon) {{of vertical}} ActiGraph activity counts during running at higher speeds {{is attributable to}} the monitor’s signal filtering and acceleration detection characteristics. Methods—Ten endurance-trained male participants [mean (SD) age= 28. 2 (4. 7) yrs] walked at 3, 5 and 7 km˙hr− 1, and ran at 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18 and 20 km˙hr− 1 on a force treadmill while wearing an ActiGraph GT 3 X monitor at the waist. <b>Triaxial</b> <b>accelerations</b> of the body’s center of mass (CoM) and frequency content of these accelerations were computed from the force treadmill data. Results—GT 3 X vertical activity counts demonstrated the expected ‘plateau/inverted-U’ phenomenon. In contrast, vertical CoM accelerations increased with increasing speed (1. 32 ± 0. 26 g at 10 km˙hr− 1 and 1. 68 ± 0. 24 g at 20 km˙hr− 1). The dominant frequency in the CoM acceleration signals increased with running speed (14. 8 ± 3. 2 Hz at 10 km˙hr− 1 and 24. 8 ± 3. 2 Hz at 20 km˙hr− 1) and lay beyond the ActiGraph bandpass filter (0. 25 to 2. 5 Hz) limits. Conclusion—CoM acceleration magnitudes during walking and running lie within the ActiGraph monitor’s dynamic acceleration detecting capability.

40|$|The aerial {{environment}} is heterogeneous {{in space and}} time and directly influences the costs of animal flight. Volant animals can reduce these costs by using different flight modes, each with their own benefits and constraints. However, the extent to which animals alter their flight modes in response to environmental conditions has rarely been studied in the wild. To provide insight into how a flight generalist can reduce the energetic cost of movement, we studied flight behaviour in relation to the aerial environmental and landscape using hundreds of hours of global positioning system and <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration</b> measurements of the lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus). Individuals differed largely in the time spent in flight, which increased linearly with the time spent in flight at sea. In general, flapping was used more frequently than more energetically efficient soaring flight. The probability of soaring increased with increasing boundary layer height and time closer to midday, reflecting improved convective conditions supportive of thermal soaring. Other forms of soaring flight were also used, including fine-scale use of orographic lift. We explore the energetic consequences of behavioural adaptations to the aerial environment and underlying landscape and implications for individual energy budgets, foraging ecology and reproductive success.

The measurements were performed in five elite breaststroke swimmers. A recording device for <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerations</b> and <b>triaxial</b> rotational angular velocity was mounted on the dorsal part of the pelvic girdle of the athlete. The task of the athlete was to swim one length of the 50 m swimming pool with the intensity similar to competition.

In this study, we developed a new method to calculate activity-specificmetabolic rates, and applied it to female fur seals. We attached biologgers(that recorded GPS locations, depth profiles, and <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration)</b> to 12 northern(Callorhinus ursinus) and 13 Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella), and used a hierarchicaldecision tree algorithm to determine time allocation between diving, transiting,resting, and performing slow movements at the surface (grooming, etc.). Weconcomitantly measured the total energy expenditure using the doubly-labelled watermethod. We used a general least-square model to establish the relationship betweentime–activity budgets and the total energy spent by each individual during their foragingtrip to predict activity-specificmetabolic rates. Results show that both species allocatedsimilar time to diving (~ 29 %), transiting to and from their foraging grounds(~ 26 – 30 %), and resting (~ 8 – 11 %). However, Antarctic fur seals spent significantlymore time grooming and moving slowly at the surface than northern fur seals (36 % vs. 29 %). Diving was the most expensive activity (~ 30 MJ/day if done non-stop for 24 hr),followed by transiting at the surface (~ 21 MJ/day). Interestingly, metabolic rates weresimilar between species while on land or while slowly moving at the surface (~ 13 MJ/day). Overall, the average field metabolic rate was ~ 20 MJ/day (for all activities combined).

The electronics of this archival datalogger measured 22 Ã� 14 Ã� 6. 5 mm, weighed 3 g, was powered by a Â½AA-sized battery weighing 10 g and housed in a transparent biocompatible tube sealed with titanium electrodes for electrocardiography (ECG). The combined weight of 32 g represented less than 2 % of the typical bodyweight of the geese. The primary tasks of the instrument were to continuously record a digitised ECG signal for heart-rate determination and store 12 -bit <b>triaxial</b> <b>accelerations</b> sampled at 100 Hz with 15 % coverage over each 2 min period. Measurement of atmospheric pressure provided an indication of altitude and rate of ascent or descent during flight. Geomagnetic field readings allowed for latitude estimation. These parameters were logged twice per minute along with body temperature. Data were stored to a memory card of 8 GB capacity. Instruments were implanted in geese captured on Mongolian lakes during the breeding season when the birds are temporarily flightless due to moulting. The goal was to collect data over a ten month period, covering both southward and northward migrations. This imposed extreme constraints on the design's power consumption. Raw ECG can be post-processed to obtain heart-rate, allowing improved rejection of signal interference due to strenuous activity of locomotory muscles during flight. Accelerometry {{can be used to}} monitor wing-beat frequency and body kinematics, and since the geese continued to flap their wings continuously even during rather steep descents, act as a proxy for biomechanical power.

The respective frequency response functions were then combined with frequency based source (engine radiated sound and forces transmitted through the mounts) data to estimate the response at the receivers. The response was characterized as the binaural sound pressure and driver 2 ̆ 7 s seat track <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration.</b> The results were verified by actual vehicle interior sound and vibration measurements and subjective (jury) evaluations at relevant operating conditions. The subjective evaluations indicated that, despite similar overall levels measured, the differences in perceived sound may still exist and are {{due to differences in}} transfer path contribution to interior sound, as seen from interaural sound measurements (between left and right ear). The adverse changes in interior vibration comfort were related to the change in rate of change of acceleration known as jerk. The Z-direction acceleration of the seat was found to be sufficient in describing interior vibration; the directions of vibration were indiscernible by the jury in subjective evaluations. Although there were slight differences in transfer path contribution the effect of using a more production efficient cast iron crank engine compared to a more durable steel crank engine, both used in the study, is negligible in terms of interior sound and vibration as indicated in estimated, objective and subjective results.

40|$|Introduction: The {{benefits}} of {{regular physical activity}} for children are significant. Previous research has addressed {{the quantity and quality}} of children 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity while in early childhood education and care (ECEC) settings, yet little research has investigated the social and physical environmental influences on physical activity in these settings. The outcomes of this study will be to measure these social and physical environmental influences on children 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity using a combination of a real-time location system (RTLS) (a closed system that tracks the location of movement of participants via readers and tags), accelerometry and direct observation. Methods and analysis: This study is the first of its kind to combine RTLSs and accelerometer data in ECEC settings. It is a cross-sectional study involving ∼ 100 educators and 500 children from 11 ECEC settings in the Illawarra region of New South Wales, Australia. A RTLS and Actigraph GT 3 X+ accelerometers will be concurrently used to measure the level and location of the children 2 ̆ 7 s and educators 2 ̆ 7 physical activity while in outside environments. Children and educators will wear accelerometers on their hip that record <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration</b> data at 100 Hz. Children and educators will also wear a tag watch on their wrist that transmits a signal to anchors of the RTLS and the triangulation of signals will identify their specific location. In addition to these, up to three random periods (10 - 25 min in length) will be used to collect observational data each day and assessed with the classroom assessment and scoring system to measure the quality of interactions. In conjunction with the real-time location system (RTLS) and accelerometers, these observations will measure the relationship between the quality of interactions and children 2 ̆ 7 s physical activity. Ethics and dissemination: The results of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations. Ethical approval was obtained through the University of Wollongong Human Research Ethics Committee (HE 14 / 330) ...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{has not been}} objectively measured in prospective cohorts with sufficiently large numbers to reliably detect associations with multiple health outcomes. Technological advances now make this possible. We describe the methods used to collect and analyse accelerometer measured physical activity in over 100, 000 participants of the UK Biobank study, and report variation by age, sex, day, time of day, and season. Participants were approached by email to wear a wrist-worn accelerometer for seven days that was posted to them. Physical activity information was extracted from 100 Hz raw <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration</b> data after calibration, removal of gravity and sensor noise, and identification of wear / non-wear episodes. We report age- and sex-specific wear-time compliance and accelerometer measured physical activity, overall and by hour-of-day, week-weekend day and season. 103, 712 datasets were received (44. 8 % response), with a median wear-time of 6. 9 days (IQR: 6. 5 - 7. 0). 96, 600 participants (93. 3 %) provided valid data for physical activity analyses. Vector magnitude, a proxy for overall physical activity, was 7. 5 % (2. 35 mg) lower per decade of age (Cohen's d = 0. 9). Women had a higher vector magnitude than men, apart from those aged 45 - 54 yrs. There were major differences in vector magnitude by time of day (d = 0. 66). Vector magnitude differences between week and weekend days (d = 0. 12 for men, d = 0. 09 for women) and between seasons (d = 0. 27 for men, d = 0. 15 for women) were small. It is feasible to collect and analyse objective physical activity data in large studies. The summary measure of overall physical activity is lower in older participants and age-related differences in activity are most prominent {{in the afternoon and}} evening. This work lays the foundation for studies of physical activity and its health consequences. Our summary variables are part of the UK Biobank dataset and can be used by researchers as exposures, confounding factors or outcome variables in future analyses...|$|R

An ambient vibration {{survey of the}} Humber Bridge {{was carried out in}} July 2008 by a combined team from the UK, Portugal and Hong Kong. The exercise had several purposes that included the evaluation of current technology for instrumentation and system identification and the generation of an experimental data set of modal properties to be used for validation and updating of finite element models for scenario simulation and structural health monitoring. The exercise was conducted as part of a project aimed at developing online diagnosis capabilities for three landmark European suspension bridges. Ten stand-alone <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration</b> recorders were deployed at locations along all three spans and in all four pylons during five days of consecutive one-hour recordings. Time series segments from the recorders were merged, and several operational modal analysis techniques were used to analyse these data and assemble modal models representing the global behavior of the bridge in all three dimensions for all components of the structure. The paper describes the equipment and procedures used for the exercise, compares the operational modal analysis (OMA) technology used for system identification and presents modal parameters for key vibration modes of the complete structure. Results obtained using three techniques: natural excitation technique/eignsystem realization algorithm, stochastic subspace identification and p-LSCF, are compared among themselves and with those obtained from a 1985 test of the bridge, showing few significant modal parameter changes over 23 years in cases where direct comparison is possible The measurement system and the much more sophisticated OMA technology used in the present test show clear advantages necessary due to the compressed timescales compared to the earlier exercise. Even so, the parameter estimates exhibit significant variability between different methods and variations of the same method, while also varying in time and having inherent variability.

40|$|Speed hump or {{also known}} as road hump is {{designed}} to ensure safety for both drivers and pedestrian. The use of speed humps in residential streets is an efficient way of controlling speed ofvehicles. However, in Malaysia some ofthe dimensions designed by the local authorities had been implemented on an 'ad hoc' basis without any proper standards or guidelines (HPU, 2002). Although Highway Planning Unit (HPU) and Standards and Industrial Research Institute of Malaysia (SIRIM) have stipulated specific ranges of dimensions for the installation of speed humps, however no perfect and ideal guidelines were introduced and were not properly enforced by the local authorities. Therefore, with many styles and inconsistent designs of the speed humps a well-established empirical study has been implemented to develop optimal designs consistency models. In this study, the geometric design of the speed hump was related to 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. The speed data were carried out by using a laser gun meter detector to obtain the spot speed data at the selected speed hump location and vibration data collection were carried out using <b>triaxial</b> <b>acceleration</b> transducers connected to Racelogic VBOX II SX. Multiple linear regression analysis was conducted to develop a statistical relationship between speed hump geometric, 85 th percentile speed and discomfort level. In the validation stage, the site empirical data were compared with the predicted data using the paired T -test and discrepancy measure such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Finally, the models have successfully developed and validated according to the statistical procedures in the study. The findings are hoped to provide a starting point towards {{the development of a}} standard for the speed humps in residential areas which will not only focus on the effectiveness but also considering the safety and discomfort level of the road users while travelling on the speed hump...|$|R
