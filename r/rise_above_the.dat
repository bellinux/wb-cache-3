5|$|Approximately 600 {{people had}} {{provided}} {{information at the}} time of the report's publication with 450 relating to Savile. This resulted in the formal recording of a total 214 alleged criminal offences across 28 police forces. No attacks within the West Mercia area are included in the figures, and Gray expected the number of recorded offences to <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> 214 considered by the report.|$|E
5|$|The 2004–08 {{volcanic}} activity of Mount St. Helens {{has been documented}} as a continuous eruption with a gradual extrusion of magma at the Mount St. Helens volcano. Starting in October 2004 there was a gradual building of a new lava dome. The new dome did not <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> caldera created by the 1980 eruption. This activity lasted until January 2008.|$|E
5|$|The line {{continues}} west {{through the}} 53rd Street Tunnel under the East River into Manhattan. After Lexington Avenue–53rd Street, the westbound tracks <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> eastbound tracks. A flying junction after Fifth Avenue/53rd Street, ties the westbound tracks into the southbound local tracks of the IND Sixth Avenue Line, which begin {{here as a}} merge of these connection tracks and the IND 63rd Street Line. At that junction, the Sixth Avenue express tracks turn west under 53rd Street, just {{to the south of}} the Queens Boulevard Line. The two lines share platforms at Seventh Avenue, but no connecting tracks are present.|$|E

5|$|Ficus obliqua occurs from Mount Dromedary (36° S) in {{southern}} New South Wales northwards {{along the coast}} and Great Dividing Range {{to the tip of}} Cape York Peninsula in north Queensland. Outside Australia it occurs on New Guinea and offshore islands, through eastern Indonesia to Sulawesi in the west and east into the southwestern Pacific, where it is found in New Caledonia, Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu. It had been thought to occur in Western Australia, but these collections have been now referred to Ficus brachypoda. Preferring soils with high nutrient and water content, it occurs on sandstone or latite soils in the Sydney region. The habitat is warm temperate to moist subtropical rainforest. Large specimens can <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> canopy as emergent trees.|$|E
5|$|Lōʻihi is {{following}} the pattern of development that is characteristic of all Hawaiʻian volcanoes. Geochemical evidence from Lōʻihi lavas indicates that Lōʻihi is in transition between the preshield and shield volcano stage, providing valuable clues to the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. In the preshield stage, Hawaiian volcanoes have steeper sides and {{a lower level of}} activity, producing an alkali basalt lava. Continued volcanism is expected to eventually create an island at Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi experiences frequent landslides; the growth of the volcano has destabilized its slopes, and extensive areas of debris inhabit the steep southeastern face. Similar deposits from other Hawaiian volcanoes indicate that landslide debris is an important product of the early development of Hawaiian volcanoes. Lōʻihi is predicted to <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface in 10,000 to 100,000 years.|$|E
5|$|Explosive eruptions may {{decrease}} and {{be followed}} by the eruption of viscous lava to form a lava dome in the newly formed crater. Precipitation would frequently trigger lahars and these would continuously create problems in the Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. If the lava dome continues to grow, it would eventually <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> crater rim. The lava would be cooling and expanding then may produce landslides to create a massive zone of blocky talus in the Squamish river valley. While the dome of lava grows, it would frequently subside to create large pyroclastic flows that would again travel down the adjacent Squamish and Cheakamus river valleys. Tephra swept away from the pyroclastic flows would create ash columns with elevations of at least , repeatedly depositing tephra on the communities of Whistler and Pemberton and again disrupting regional air traffic. Lava of the unstable dome may occasionally create minor pyroclastic flows, explosions and eruption columns. The community of Squamish would be abandoned, Highway 99 {{would be out of}} service and destroyed, and traffic adjacent to Vancouver, Pemberton and Whistler would remain forced to travel along a route to the east that is more lengthy than Highway 99.|$|E

25|$|As {{a star in}} {{the deep}} {{northern}} hemisphere of the sky, Beta Cassiopeiae is prominent to viewers in the northern hemisphere but not often seen by those in the southern hemisphere.

25|$|The actual {{existence}} of far-reaching type-differences, of which I have described eight groups in , has {{enabled me to}} conceive the two controversial theories of neurosis as manifestations of a type-antagonism.

25|$|Stars (and constellations) {{that are}} {{circumpolar}} in one hemisphere are always {{invisible in the}} high latitudes of the opposite hemisphere, and these never <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> horizon.

25|$|To {{the east}} of this divide, the {{elevation}} of the hilltops gradually decreases, and the landscape is more gently rolling. Within 30 miles (50 kilometers) of the coast, few hills exceed 300 feet (100 meters) in elevation. Near the coast, swamps, marshes, and ponds alternate with low hills. However, the Blue Hills, just south of Boston, <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surrounding landscape. The state probably {{takes its name from}} the Massachusett name for their highest point, Great Blue Hill, with an elevation of 635 feet (194 meters).|$|E
25|$|Specific {{rail-to-rail}} comparators with p-n-p input transistors, {{like the}} LM139 family, allow the input potential to drop 0.3nbsp&volts below the negative supply rail, {{but do not}} allow it to <b>rise</b> <b>above</b> <b>the</b> positive rail. Specific ultra-fast comparators, like the LMH7322, allow input signal to swing below the negative rail and above the positive rail, although by a narrow margin of only 0.2nbsp&V. Differential input voltage (the voltage between two inputs) of a modern rail-to-rail comparator is usually limited only by the full swing of power supply.|$|E
