Foran disse vanninntakene er det installert varegrinder som beskytter turbinene mot større objekter som kommer flytende med vannet. I mange tilfeller er turbinpassasje den eneste tilgjengelige vannveien for nedstrøms vandrende fisk. Valg av lysåpning i varegrinder foran turbininntakene har hittil først og fremst blitt gjort som følge av driftsmessige forhold av kraftverkseieren, og det har vært lite fokus på varegrinder som bevarings- og fiskeforsterkningstiltak i norske regulerte vassdrag med elvekraftverk. Dette til tross for at det har vært et tema i internasjonale fagjournaler i årtier. Varegrindene ved Hunderfossen kraftverk ble skiftet ut i løpet av vintrene 2009 / 10 og 2010 / 11. De gamle varegrindene hadde en lysåpning på 6 cm, mens de nye grindene har en lysåpning på 10 cm mellom de vertikalstilte elementene. Nedvandrende smolt kan passere med lysåpning 6 cm og med en åpning på 10 cm er det mulig for de fleste gytevandrende Hunderørretene å passere gjennom varegrindene under returvandringen mot Mjøsa. Fra et fiskebiologisk ståsted er det ikke ønskelig at hverken smolt eller støing passerer gjennom turbinen. Dette kan føre både til akutt dødelighet og skader med langtidsvirkning. For smolt som skal vandre videre gjennom Lågendeltaet med mye rovfisk (gjedde, abbor og lake) kan turbinpassasje føre til at de blir mer utsatt for predasjon. Hensikten med studiet var å undersøke om skifting til varegrind med større lysåpning (10 cm) gir økt risiko for at utgytt ørret (støing) og smolt passerer gjennom turbinene. Gytefiskundersøkelsen ble gjennomført høst og vår. Smoltundersøkelsen ble gjennomført om våren uten slipp av vann gjennom flom- og isluker, og resultatene er sammenlignet med tilsvarende telemetristudier i 1998. Videre er det undersøkt gytevandringer og gytested for radiomerket gytefisk oppstrøms dam og returvandring mot dam etter gyting. For utgytt ørret er det undersøkt terskelverdier for vannslipp over isluka i forhold til nedvandring forbi dammen og videre nedvandring gjennom minstevannføringsstrekningen til Fåberg. Materiale og metode; Til sammen ble det radiomerket 49 voksne Hunderørret fanget i fisketrappa ved Hunderfossen og 50 stk to-årig smolt fra settefiskanlegget ved Hunderfossen som alle ble satt ut ovenfor dammen. De radiomerkede ørretene ble peilet både manuelt og ved to automatiske dataloggingsstasjoner nedenfor Hunderfossen dam. Det ble gjennomført to forsøk med ulike vannslipp over isluka for å avdekke laveste funksjonelle terskelverdi og effekten av et kontinuerlig vannslipp på 5 m 3 /s over isluka i tre døgn. Resultater voksen ørret: Oppstrøms vandringer og gyteområder ble registrert for 40 gytevandrende Hunderørret. Gyting ble registrert på følgende syv lokaliteter; Strømshugguet ved Rybakken (3 stk), Øyer ved Tingberg (17 stk), Sæterfossen ved Skarsmoen (6 stk), Hovdefossen (1 stk), Tretten fra Lybekkstrømmen og ned til Hovdefossen (7 stk), Tretten ved Bådstø (5 stk) og Frya (1 stk). Dette er hovedsakelig de samme gyteplassene som er registrert tidligere. De mest intense periodene for returvandring foregikk i to puljer på henholdsvis høsten og våren; 10. – 31. oktober 2011 og 24. – 25. mai 2012. Det første forsøket med vannslipp over isluka avdekket en minste terskelverdi for på 3 m 3 /s for passasje av utgytt ørret. Dette tilsvarer et vannsøyle på 28 cm over lukekanten. Det andre lukeforsøket med 5 m 3 /s i tre døgn viste at 41, 7 % av utgytt ørret foran turbininntaket passerte isluka i løpet av første døgnet, og 83, 3 % hadde passert etter tre døgn. Background: All run-of-river {{hydro power}} plants have a turbine forebay {{area in which}} {{production}} water is drawn into the turbine shafts. In front of the intake shafts there are trash racks to avoid entrainment of coarse woody debris. In many cases the turbine waterway is the only available passage route for downstream migrating fish. The choice of spacing between the trash rack beams is generally based on operational considerations by the power plant owner, and only rarely considered in a conservational context by the authorities {{despite the fact that}} this has been an international research topic for decades. The old trash racks spaced 6 cm at Hunderfossen power plant was replaced with new and 10 cm spaced racks in 2009 / 10 and 2010 / 11. A 10 cm spacing provide very limited physical hindrance for migrating fish to pass the trash racks and enter the turbines. From a fisheries management point of view it is not desirable to allow neither smolts nor kelts of any species to pass through turbines due to the risks of instant mortality and long term damages. The lower reaches of River Gudbrandsdalslågen contain abundant populations of predator species like pike, perch and burbot which have the capacity to inflict delayed mortality through predation on damaged and perplexed smolts. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine whether the effect of increased spacing between the steel elements of the trash rack (from 6 to 10 cm) inflicted increased risk of turbine entrainment of trout kelts and smolts. The kelt surveys were conducted in autumn and spring, and smolt surveys were done in early spring without release of spillwater through the spillways. The effect from increased spacing is evaluated by comparing findings from previous telemetry studies in 1998. In addition the study revealed spawning locations above the Hunderfossen dam, and further explored the lower threshold values for downstream passage of kelts through the iceand trash spillway. Material and methods: In total 49 adult trout were captured and tagged during their upstream migration in the fishway, and 50 hatchery-reared 2 -year-old smolts were radio-tagged and released above the dam. Tracking was performed manually and by two automatic data logging stations. Two trials involving different water discharges through the ice- and spillway were conducted in order to reveal the lowest functional discharge required for downstream passage of kelts, and the effect of 3 -days release of 5 m 3 /s during the migration period. Results adult trout: The spawning sites for 40 trout were recorded between Rybakken in Øyer and Frya in Sør-Fron. The most intense return migration periods for kelts occurred in autumn (10 - 31 October) and spring (24 - 25 May). The lowest water discharge required for passing kelts through the ice- and trash spillway was 3 m 3 /s, which correspond to a 28 cm water column over the spillway crest. Release of 5 m 3 /s during a 3 days period (day and night) resulted in a passage efficiency of 41. 7 % after the first day, and 83. 3 % after three days. However, only two (20 %) out of 10 trout that successfully passed the spillway continued further downstream migration towards Lake Mjøsa during the lowest regulated water flow, one trout migrated downstream during an artificial freshet, and the remaining 7 trout over-wintered in the pools below the dam. Results smolt: In total, 50 radio tagged smolts were released at Granrudmoen Øyer on May 16, and unlike the results from smolt studies in 1998, many of them migrated directly towards the turbine intake. First records of smolt passage on the ADS station at Fåberg was on May 17 0739 am. In total 27 smolts were logged at this ADS station, and no records were detected on the ADS station on the regulated river section. The smolt passages at Fåberg occurred between 17 and 28 May, and 67 % had passed Fåberg within 4 days after release at Granrundmoen. Smolt migration took place during nighttime. The remaining 23 smolts were either killed in the turbines or passed the ADS station without being recorded. It is concluded that probably all smolts passed the power plant by descending through the turbines. The data does not provide sufficient power to estimate mortality from turbine passage. Conclusions and recommendations for kelts: The return migration of kelts from the spawning grounds occurs in two heats; during, and shortly after, spawning in October and in the early phase of the spring flood in May. Release of 5 m 3 /s over three days resulted in 83. 3 % passage efficiency of kelts, but 70 % of the passing kelts over-wintered in the pool below the dam, and only 30 % migrated to Lake Mjøsa. Aborted downstream migration may be a result of the 3 - 4 m free fall down to the concrete channel and friction damages to the skin, mucus and eyes during the descent. It is also recommended that the ice- and trash spillway is actively maneuvered to provide sufficient passage opportunities for kelts. The lower threshold value for kelt passage over the spillway crest was 3 m 3 s- 1, which corresponds to a 28 cm water column. It is recommended that the ice- and trash spillway should release 5 m 3 s- 1 from 5 October to 5 November each year. The height of the free fall from the spillway crest to the concrete channel floor should also be reduced to avoid injuries affecting the motivation to migrate. The concrete channel and the rock formations in the lower parts should be smoothed. Conclusions and recommendations for smolts: Compared to previous investigations when the old trash rack was present, hatchery-reared smolts quickly migrated towards the turbine forebay and descended without hesitation. This behaviour is interpreted as an effect of the new and coarser trash rack spacing. Whether these findings are representative for wild smolts is not clear, and similar investigations for wild smolts should be conducted. It is also recommended all hatchery-reared smolts are released below Hunderfossen dam to avoid losses from turbine mortality. Further, if wild smolts perform similarly, it is necessary to establish measures to prevent or reduce turbine entrainment of wild smolt. These include reduced rack spacing either as a permanent arrangement, or a temporary and <b>removable</b> <b>rack</b> to be installed during migration season. Selected measures and arrangements should be evaluated through further migration studies on wild and hatchery-reared smolts. © Norsk institutt for naturforskning.
