40|$|During {{the last}} year several {{significant}} disasters have occurred such as Superstorm Sandy on the East coast of the United States, and Typhoon Bopha in the Phillipines, along with several others. In support of these disasters NASA's Shortterm Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center delivered various products derived from satellite imagery {{to help in the}} assessment of damage and recovery of the affected areas. To better support the decision makers responding to the disasters SPoRT quickly developed several solutions to provide the data using open Geographical Information Service (GIS) formats. Providing the data in open GIS standard formats allowed the end user to easily integrate the data into existing Decision Support Systems (DSS). Both Tile Mapping Service (TMS) and Web Mapping Service (WMS) were leveraged to quickly provide the data to the enduser. Development of the deliver methodology allowed quick response to <b>rapidly</b> <b>developing</b> <b>disasters</b> and enabled NASA SPoRT to bring science data to decision makers in a successful research to operations transition...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Multiple Damaging Hydrological Events are <b>rapidly</b> <b>developing</b> into {{worldwide}} <b>disasters</b> with {{effects to}} the vi-able habitat for humankind and ecosystems. This research describes how data assimilation friendly models combining re-motely sensed and ground hydrological data {{could be used}} for developing a soft geovisual communication in order to re-duce the uncertainty in rainstorm hazard mapping. For this, a set of sequential GIScience rules was utilized for converting coding data of a Rainstorm Hazard Index (RHI) from point record to spatial information using TRMM–NASA satellite rain data as covariate. Examples of probability estimation for different precipitation durations, ranging from 3 to 48 hours and the quantification of hydrological hazard fields were used with probability maps of damaging rainstorms prone-areas for the test-region of Southern Italy. Results show that sub-regional rainstorm hazard modelling can provide probability maps for damaging events in Italy with a spatial variability resolution of around 20 km. Spatially finer estimates (e. g., at local-scale: < 10 km) can be ensured only with the availability of more accurate and detailed remote sensing rain data...|$|R
