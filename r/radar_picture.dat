2500|$|The <b>radar</b> <b>picture</b> of a raster-scan {{synthetic}} {{display is}} produced {{on a television}} screen and {{is made up of}} a large number of horizontal lines which form a pattern known as a raster. This type of display is much more complex than the radial-scan synthetic display and requires a large amount of memory. [...] There are a number of advantages for the operator of a raster-scan display and concurrently there are some deficiencies too. The most obvious advantage of a raster-scan display is the brightness of the picture. This allows the observer to view the screen in almost all conditions of ambient light. Out of all the benefits offered by a raster-scan radar it is this ability which has assured its success. Another difference between the radial-scan ...|$|E

LCDR Overstreet acknowledged the warning and complied with procedures to abort the mission and return to base. Approaching from the northeastern coast at supersonic speed, the MiGs easily overtook the EC-121, who could do little with their [...] "warning." [...] The MiGs were armed with 23mm cannons and AA-2 Atoll missiles; the EC-121 was unarmed and without a fighter escort. At 13:47 the radar tracks of the MiGs merged with that of Deep Sea 129, which disappeared from the <b>radar</b> <b>picture</b> two minutes later. The MiGs had blown the EC-121 out of the sky, and while {{the details of the}} incident have never been released to the public, it is assumed that an air-to-air missile was used as the North Korean press mentioned that a [...] "single shot" [...] downed the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|The {{integration}} of a Lassen Research PSP-32 processor in 1992 enabled Doppler capability. The new system was renamed the TAMU Aggie Doppler Radar (TAMU-ADRAD).

Starting in October 1998, live <b>radar</b> <b>pictures</b> from the ADRAD were available online during storms.|$|R
50|$|A high-resolution, north-oriented, {{coloured}} <b>radar</b> <b>picture</b> {{is displayed}} on PC display.

Different geographical maps can be overlaid on the radar display. A target position can be marked for further investigation, or combing of the area by ground forces.|$|E
50|$|An {{ambiguity}} {{function of}} this kind would be somewhat of a misnomer; it would have no ambiguities at all, and both the zero-delay and zero-Doppler cuts would be an impulse. This is not usually desirable (if a target has any Doppler shift from an unknown velocity it will disappear from the <b>radar</b> <b>picture),</b> but if Doppler processing is independently performed, knowledge of the precise Doppler frequency allows ranging without interference from any other targets which are not also moving {{at exactly the same}} velocity.|$|E

50|$|On 29 January, seven Kawasaki Ki-48 of the Army's Shichisi Mitate Tokubetsu Kōgeki Tai counter-attacked the Allied fleet at {{low level}} as the British {{aircraft}} were returning from Palembang. The British <b>radar</b> <b>picture</b> was confused {{by the presence of}} over 100 friendly aircraft and the first two or three Supermarine Seafire CAP interceptions did not occur until just before the Ki-48 formation entered the air defence zone. The last pair of Seafires chased the five remaining Ki-48s inside the screen, and with the support of returning Vought F4U Corsairs and Grumman F6F Hellcats which had just been scrambled, shot down all of them, amongst intense AA fire. One Seafire was slightly damaged and one Hellcat was written off by friendly fire, but the only ship to be damaged was the carrier , hit by heavy AA shells.Such success, minor by Pacific fighting standards at the time, gave the British Pacific Fleet useful expertise and confidence in its ability to deal with kamikaze attacks.|$|E
