Several reforms have been enacted since the late 1980 s to correct this situation. By making use of the decisions of the Italian Court of Cassation (which have shaped medical malpractice law) from 1970 to 2009, we show that these reforms had no general statistically significant impact on delays.

This study sought {{to determine whether a}} 50 percent increase in national operations could be achieved by limiting demand growth at large hub airports and instead growing traffic levels at the surrounding regional airports.

40|$|The {{importance}} of railway transportation {{has been increasing}} in the world. Considering the current and future estimates of high cargo and passenger transportation volume in railways, prevention or <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> due to any failure is becoming ever more crucial.

This paper presents a simple state-based prognostic method that aims to detect and forecast failure progression in electro-mechanical systems. The method is compared with Hidden Markov Model based methods on real data collected from a railway turnout system. Obtaining statistically sufficient failure progression samples is difficult considering that the natural progression of failures in electro-mechanical systems may take years. In addition, validating the classification model is difficult when the degradation is not observable. Data collection and model validation strategies for failure progression are also presented...|$|E

The main objectives for the introduction of a road pricing scheme, in a congested city network, include <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays,</b> environmental improvement and revenue increase. These objectives are closely associated with the concepts of sustainable mobility in urban areas with respect to social equity, economic effi ciency and environmental responsibility. This paper attempts to estimate the potential interrelation between urban road pricing and sustainable mobility management policy by modelling the impacts (traffi c network operation, environmental indices and revenue) of a hypothetic implementation of cordon tolls in the city centre of Thessaloniki (situated in northern Greece), which faces severe traffi c and environmental problems. The evalua-tion was carried out using the SATURN traffi c simulation model, which was developed at the Institute for Transport Studies, University of Leeds, UK. SATURN is a well-known transport analysis model which is widely used. In order to assess the impacts of traffi c scenarios, the software runs a simulation-assignment procedure simultaneously using commonly accepted algorithms that originate from transport theory such as all-or-nothing assignment, Wardorp’s principles.

40|$|Urban {{transportation}} systems {{are vulnerable to}} congestion, accidents, weather, special events, and other costly delays. Whereas typical policy responses prioritize <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> under normal conditions to improve the efficiency of urban road systems, analytic support for investments that improve resilience (defined as system recovery from additional disruptions) is still scarce. In this effort, we represent paved roads as a transportation network by mapping intersections to nodes and road segments between the intersections to links. We built road networks for 40 of the urban areas defined by the U. S. Census Bureau. We developed and calibrated a model to evaluate traffic delays using link loads. The loads may be regarded as traffic-based centrality measures, estimating {{the number of individuals}} using corresponding road segments. Efficiency was estimated as the average annual delay per peak-period auto commuter, and modeled results were found to be close to observed data, with the notable exception of New York City. Resilience was estimated as the change in efficiency resulting from roadway disruptions and was found to vary between cities, with increased delays due to a 5 % random loss of road linkages ranging from 9. 5 % in Los Angeles to 56. 0 % in San Francisco. The results demonstrate that many urban road systems that operate inefficiently under normal conditions are nevertheless resilient to disruption, whereas some more efficient cities are more fragile. The implication is that resilience, not just efficiency, should be considered explicitly in roadway project selection and justify investment opportunities related to disaster and other disruptions.

40|$|A smooth {{operation}} {{is a crucial}} factor {{for the success of}} the railway system. However, the railway is an open system and therefore very sensitive towards external disturbances which unavoidably lead to delays. Consequently, {{it is very important that}} a dispatcher is able to prevent late train from impeding other rides which would cause even more delays. To assist the dispatchers with their work, numerous computational methods for solving allocation conflicts have been developed in recent years. However, the methods were only evaluated superficially so far. A major problem in the evaluation is the lack of a gold standard which specifies an optimal solution for a given situation. Without this optimal solution one can only show that a method computes acceptable and plausible results, but it cannot be estimated how much potential is actually being utilized. In this thesis, an optimal solution method is developed using the approach of the mixed-integer linear programming (MIP). The method is based on a very detailed model of the railway infrastructure and of the train movements. Resource allocation is modelled by using the blocking time theory. After an optimization of the runtime behaviour, the MIP-solver Gurobi is able to determine an optimum scheduling decision within short time. For most situations, the computation only takes a few minutes. This thesis therefore shows that the computer hardware and the MIP solvers have reached a level which allows a realistic optimization of train dispatching. Using the optimal scheduling method, the quality of various heuristic scheduling methods is determined. Special emphasis is placed on analyzing a wide array of different models and approaches. In order to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the various methods more accurately, six dispatching regions with different properties and different types of fault situations are considered. The various scheduling methods are compared with respect to the quality of the found solutions and their real-time capability. Short runtimes are necessary because a significant <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> can only be achieved if the computation is complete long before the allocation conflict begins. The results are finally used to draw conclusions which heuristic is recommendable in which situation...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Loss-to-follow-up (LTFU) in the {{prevention}} of mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) programmes can occur at multiple stages of antenatal and follow-up care. This paper presents findings from a national assessment aimed at identifying major bottlenecks in Côte d'Ivoire's PMTCT cascade, and to distinguish characteristics of high- and low-performing health facilities. Methods: This cross-sectional study, based on a nationally representative sample of 30 health facilities in Côte d'Ivoire used multiple data sources (registries, patient charts, patient booklets, interviews) to determine the magnitude of LTFU in PMTCT services. A composite measure of retention – based on child prophylaxis, maternal treatment and infant testing – was used to identify high- and low-performing sites and determine significant differences using Student's t-tests. Results: Among 1, 741 pregnant women newly recorded as HIV-positive between June 2011 and May 2012, 43 % had a CD 4 count taken, 77 % received appropriate prophylaxis and 70 % received prophylaxis intended for their infant. During that time, 1, 054 first infant HIV tests were recorded. A conservative rate of adherence to antiretroviral therapy was estimated at 50 % (n= 219 patient charts). Significant differences between high- and low-performing sites included: duration of time elapsed between HIV testing and CD 4 results (29. 5 versus 56. 3 days, p= 0. 001); and density (number per 100 first antenatal care visits) of full-time physicians (6. 7 versus 1. 7, p= 0. 04), laboratory technicians (2. 3 versus 0. 7, p= 0. 046), staff trained in PMTCT (10. 7 versus 4. 7, p= 0. 01), and staff performing patient follow-up activities (7. 9 versus 2. 5, p= 0. 02). Key informants highlighted staff presence and training, the availability of medical supplies and equipment (i. e., on-site CD 4 machine), and the adequacy of infrastructure (i. e., space and ventilation) as perceived key factors positively and negatively impacting retention in care. Conclusions: Patient LTFU occurred throughout the PMTCT cascade from maternal to infant testing, with retention scores ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 83. Sites that scored higher had more dedicated and trained frontline health workers, and emphasised patient follow-up through outreach and the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> in care.

40|$|AbstractMany {{actions have}} been {{recently}} carried out within European cities {{with the aim}} of reducing the negative impacts on traffic and environment caused by city logistics. Promising results have been reported with the increasingly popular initiative of the use of small sized electric vehicles (SEV), due to their improved energy efficiency, local zero emissions and lower traffic disturbance. Along this paper, on a first step, the authors estimate the effects of adopting SEV from the city perspective. Therefore, authors analyze how the use of small sized electric vehicles such as tricycles and cargo cycles in city logistics affects traffic, energy efficiency and emissions. First, the authors identify what should be the geographical coverage of implementation of small sized electric vehicles solutions. Second, authors identify the market penetration share by small sized electric vehicles that lead to better results in terms of traffic, energy and environment to all stakeholders directly affected by city logistics operations. The assessment follows two distinct approaches, based on geographical coverage and on stakeholders’ impacts. The first one distinguishes the impacts of the initiative at street level, unit level and on the city system. Such analysis reflects the behaviour of the all spatial system and allows having a broader view on the geographical impact of the initiative. The second one distinguishes the respective impacts disaggregated by stakeholder group. It will be presented the environmental, operational and economic effects of 4 scenarios of market penetration by small sized vehicles, replacing diesel vans on city logistics by 10, 30, 50 and 100 %. The results show that the geographical scale that leads to better energy, environmental and traffic benefits is the street level, acknowledging the short distance scope of SEV's. At this geographical coverage, SEV lead to better improvements on the motorized mobility of the area, when the scenario represents a market penetration by 10 %, with a <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> by 10 %, distance travelled by 16 % and speed by 7 %. On a second step, authors estimate the effects of adopting SEV from the suppliers (industry) perspective, focusing on operational costs and determining the break-even point under the conditions previously defined. The methodology is applied to Porto (Portugal) and calibrated with real world on-road performance of SEV on different driving conditions. In the 10 % scenario the WTW energy consumption and CO 2 emissions are reduced by 3 to 4 %. Also for this scenario, 56 euros per year must be spent to save 1 MJ of energy in WTW, which does not proves the use of SEV's on city logistics as particularly effective...|$|E
30|$|Aviation {{infrastructure}} {{also plays}} an important role in fuel consumption optimization. Infrastructure improvements present a major opportunity for fuel consumption reduction in aviation. The design of an airport, including the location of the runways and taxiways relative to terminal buildings, clearly has an effect on aircraft fuel burn, because <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delays</b> and decreased taxiing time can provide significant aircraft fuel burn reduction. Airport congestion and improper air traffic management increase the fuel consumption. Airport congestion occurs whenever the actual traffic demand is greater than what the system can handle without the delay. According to Simaiakis et al. [109] airport surface congestion at major airports in the United States and Europe is responsible for increased taxi-out times, fuel burn and emissions. Air Traffic Management (ATM) {{plays an important}} role in reducing the environmental impacts of air transportation by reducing the inefficiencies during the operations of an aircraft [110]. Ryerson et al. [111] analyzed the possible fuel savings from Air Traffic Management (ATM) improvements and the study explored the impact of the airborne delay, departure delay, and excess planned flight time, and terminal efficiency in fuel consumption using econometric techniques. In addition the better terminal design can also reduce the fuel consumption. There are a number of ways that airports, airlines and ATM providers can improve the air transportation system to minimize fuel burn and emissions. These include improving the use of the airspace, air traffic control and operations and further improving the use of airspace and air traffic control includes the flexible use of airspace, route redesign, using the new tools and programmes to find most effective route, and reduced separation between the aircraft. Salah [112] developed the model of optimal flight paths taking into consideration jet noise, fuel consumption, constraints and extreme operational limits of the aircraft on approach. The results of this study showed that, the environmental impacts and fuel consumption are reduced by the use of aircraft trajectory optimization during arrivals. Beside this there are some constraints to the improved ATM which includes the air traffic controller (ATC). ATC prevents the ideal trajectory of the aircraft to be flown due to a number of reasons such as safe separation, congested airspace, restricted airspace, delay management and weather avoidance etc. The priorities of controller are also taken into the account. For air traffic controller the safety comes first thereafter the performance. Therefore, by optimizing the aviation infrastructure, there is the potential to reduce fuel consumption. A comprehensive list of the reviewed studies of aviation operations & infrastructure affecting FCO is presented in the literature [1, 3, 7, 11 – 20, 32, 33, 38, 40 – 42, 44, 48, 53, 54, 61, 67, 69, 70, 72 – 75, 85, 86, 94, 95, 98, 104 – 182].|$|E

This study aims at determining the actual epidemiology and intra-hospital prognosis of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock (CS) requiring circulatory assist device (CAD). MethodsWe analyzed data collected between June 06 and September 09 in the “Observatoire Régional Breton sur l’Infarctus (ORBI) ”, a registry of all patients admitted to an interventional cardiology centre of Brittany in the acute phase of a STEMI, within 24 h of symptoms onset. Main clinical data and intra hospital outcome were compared between ORBI patients requiring CAD for CS (group 1) and those who didn’t require CAD (group 2). ResultsAmong 2700 patients included in the ORBI registry, 101 patients (3. 7 %) required CAD: intra aortic balloon pump (IABP), 93 patients (3. 4 %), extra corporal life support (ECLS), 2 patients (0. 07 %), IABP and ECLS, 6 patients (0. 2 %). Main clinical data are summarized in table 1. Group 1 mortality was high (38 %), compared to the low mortality in group 2 (4 %, p< 0. 0001). Mean length of hospitalisation was significantly higher in the group 1 than in the group 2 (respectively 8. 9 ± 7 and 6. 7 ± 4 days, p= 0. 03). Factors associated with CAD requiring were: age, anterior area STEMI, coronary angioplasty, three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease and haemo dynamic parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, grade 3 or 4 Killip, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)). In group 1, predictive factors of mortality were: age, three-vessel or left main coronary artery disease, blood pressure, grade 3 or 4 Killip and LVEF.

40|$|International audienceIt is {{currently}} an acknowledged fact that interconnects introduce delays and consume power and chip resources. To {{deal with these}} issues, data coding for interconnect power and timing optimization has been introduced. In today's Systems On Chip, some of these techniques are no longer efficient due to their codec complexity or to their experimentations that are not realistic anymore. Based on some realistic observations on interconnect delay and power estimation, previous works have introduced the Spatial Switching technique, which allows the <b>reduction</b> <b>of</b> <b>delay</b> and power consumption for on-chip buses. This paper deals with some Spatial Switching improvements and also explains how to obtain automatically the best results in terms <b>of</b> power consumption <b>reduction</b> with the Spatial Switching technique by using the Interconnect Explorer tool...|$|R
