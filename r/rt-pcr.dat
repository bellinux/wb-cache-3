5|$|Morpholinos can {{interfere}} with pre-mRNA processing steps either by preventing splice-directing small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNP) complexes from binding to their targets at the borders of introns on a strand of pre-mRNA, or by blocking the nucleophilic adenine base and preventing it from forming the splice lariat structure, or by interfering with the binding of splice regulatory proteins such as splice silencers and splice enhancers. Preventing the binding of snRNP U1 (at the donor site) or U2/U5 (at the polypyrimidine moiety and acceptor site) can cause modified splicing, commonly excluding exons from the mature mRNA. Targeting some splice targets results in intron inclusions, while activation of cryptic splice sites can lead to partial inclusions or exclusions. Targets of U11/U12 snRNPs can also be blocked.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Noninvasive genetic {{tests that}} use {{cell-free}} fetal DNA (cffDNA) are used increasingly in prenatal care. A low amount of cffDNA can have detrimental {{effects on the}} reliability of these tests. A marker to confirm the presence of fetal nucleic acids is therefore required that is universally applicable and easy to incorporate. METHODS: We developed a novel multiplex, single-tube, noninvasive fetal sex determination assay by combining amplification of AMELY cffDNA with one-step reverse transcription (RT) -PCR of trophoblast-derived cell-free RNA (cfRNA), which functions as a sex-independent fetoplacental marker. We tested plasma samples from 75 pregnant women in duplicate in a blinded fashion. The fetus was considered to be male {{in the case of a}} positive result for AMELY and cfRNA amplification in both <b>RT-PCRs.</b> The fetus was considered to be female in the case of negative AMELY and positive cfRNA result in both <b>RT-PCRs.</b> In other cases, the test was repeated. We compared the results with invasive prenatal testing and pregnancy outcomes. RESULTS: The AMELY cffDNA amplification and cfRNA result was unambiguous and identical in duplicate in 71 of 75 plasma samples (95 %). Four samples (5 %) required an extra replicate because of an absent fetoplacental marker. Thereafter, fetal sex was correctly determined in all 75 plasma samples.

It {{is believed that}} an increased mechanosensitivity of HGPS cells is a causative factor for vascular cell death and vascular diseases in HGPS patients. However, the exact mechanism is unknown. Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are cationic channels that can act as cellular sensors for mechanical stimuli. The aim of this {{present study was to}} examine the expression and functional role of TRP channels in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) from the patients with HGPS. The mRNA and protein expression of TRP channels in HGPS and control (IMR 90) iPSC-ECs were examined by semi-quantitative <b>RT-PCRs</b> and immunoblots, respectively. Hypotonicity-induced cytosolic Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +]i) rise in iPSC-ECs was measured by confocal microscopy. <b>RT-PCRs</b> and immunoblots showed higher expressional levels of TRPV 2 in iPSC-ECs from HGPS patients than those from normal individuals.

40|$|Background: Pluripotent {{embryonic}} stem (ES) cells that can differentiate into functional cardiomyocytes {{as well as}} vascular cells in cell culture may {{open the door to}} cardiovascular cell transplantation. However, the percentage of ES cells in embryoid bodies (EBs) which spontaneously undergo cardiovascular differentiation is low (< 10 %), making strategies for their specific labeling and purification indispensable. Methods: The human connexin 40 (Cx 40) promoter was isolated and cloned in the vector pEGFP. The specificity of the construct was initially assessed in Xenopus embryos injected with Cx 40 -EGFP plasmid DNA. Stable Cx 40 -EGFP ES cell clones were differentiated and fluorescent cells were enriched manually as well as via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Characterization of these cells was performed with respect to spontaneous beating as well as via <b>RT-PCRs</b> and immunofluorescent stainings. Results: Cx 40 -EGFP reporter plasmid injection led to EGFP fluorescence specifically in the abdominal aorta of frog tadpoles. After crude manual enrichment of highly Cx 40 -EGFP- positive EBs, the appearance of cardiac and vascular structures was increased approximately 3 -fold. Immuno fluorescent stainings showed EGFP expression exclusively in vascular-like structures simultaneously expressing von Willebrand factor and in formerly beating areas expressing alpha-actinin. Cx 40 -EGFP-expressing EBs revealed significantly higher numbers of beating cardiomyocytes and vascular-like structures. Semiquantitative <b>RT-PCRs</b> confirmed an enhanced cardiovascular differentiation as shown for the cardiac markers Nkx 2. 5 and MLC 2 v, as well as the endothelial marker vascular endothelial cadherin. Conclusions: Our work shows the feasibility of specific labeling and purification of cardiovascular progenitor cells from differentiating EBs based on the Cx 40 promoter. We provide proof of principle that the deleted CD 4 (Delta CD 4) surface marker-based method for magnetic cell sorting developed by our group will be ideally suitable for transference to this promoter.
