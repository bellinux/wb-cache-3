40|$|Objective: We endeavoured to {{determine}} whether individuals who are not physicians are likely to arrive at correct diagnoses by using Internet resources. Methods: In this prospective study four non-physicians used Google to search for diagnoses. They reviewed the 26 diagnostic cases presented in the case records of the New England Journal of Medicine during 2005; they were blind to the correct diagnoses. The main measurement was the percentage of correct diagnoses arrived at by non-physicians by using Google. The diagnostic success of the four non-physicians was {{compared to that of}} four young physicians. Results: The average diagnostic success of non-physicians was 22. 1 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 5 - 39. 7 %). There was no statistically significant difference between the non-physicians regarding this outcome (p = 0. 11). They took 8. 9 +/- 6. 7 (mean +/- standard deviation) minutes for case <b>record</b> <b>reading</b> and 17. 4 +/- 7. 9 ininutes for Google searching per case. Non-physicians performed worse than physicians (50. 9 % [95 % CI 37. 4 - 64. 5 %]) in regard to diagnostic success (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Non-physicians, at least those who have similar characteristics to the participants in the present study, may occasionally reach correct diagnoses by performing a brief web-based search.

40|$|Dual-processing {{theories}} of conceptual change hypothesize that if {{children are more}} personally involved in a lesson they will process the information more deeply leading to more and stronger conceptual change (Dole & Sinatra, 1998). This study tests this theory by increasing personal involvement through anticipation of a future discussion. Furthermore, argumentative discussions using the Collaborative Reasoning (CR) approach {{are thought to be}} more involving than regular discussions (Chinn, Anderson, & Waggoner, 2001) so exposure to CR discussions was used to increase this effect.

First grade students from a Midwestern elementary school participated in an after school reading club that met daily. This reading experience was different from others because these first grade students were grouped by learning style preferences. Meanwhile, many classroom teachers respond {{to the challenge of}} differentiating reading instruction based solely on students’ reading ability levels creating a forever “reading below grade level” for struggling readers placed in low reading groups. The primary {{purpose of this study was}} to explore reading instruction utilizing learning style preferences of first grade students. An overarching question for this study, “How might reading instruction (nurture) aligned with the child’s learning style preference (nature) impact the child’s reading achievement?” To investigate this question the researcher created a supplemental reading experience after school by grouping children by their learning style preference to differentiate instruction. Utilizing the right kind of quality instruction with the right level of intensity and duration with the right children at the right time created an effective preventive program (Torgesen, 1998). That is differentiated instruction! A pretest and posttest assessment was conducted using running <b>record</b> <b>reading</b> assessments focusing on the total number of errors recorded. This quantitative research design, randomized pretest-posttest control group analyzed the collected data using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA).

Materials appreciation of literature is taught in schools since the students are in junior high schools (SMP) and continue on the high school level (SMA). A method or approach to learning in the applied repeatedly on the appreciation of a novel, can elevate the level of saturation and reduce the interest of the students of literature. This should be avoided for the success of the education, because a lot of literature to provide a useful value in life. Therefore, a new way in novel appreciation in should be developed so that the student does not feel stale and saturated to the appreciation of literature that is not less important compared to learning the language, there is even a close relationship between language and literature. One example is appreciate the novel with identify or analyze interfigure conversation. Based on the background of the problems raised in this research, namely (1) follow-existent said illocutionary are used in conversation interfigure novel of Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas, (2) follow the function said illocutionary are used in conversation interfigure novel of Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas, (3) the follow-mode illocutionary said what is used in conversation interfigure novel of Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas, and (4) the implications of what can be obtained from the characteristic illocutionary in the conversation interfigure novel of Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas to teaching literature appreciation. With this research the expected benefits, both theoretically and practically. Theoretically the benefits obtained in the two fields, namely fields of literature and field sosiolinguistic. In the field of literature, the results of this research can be used as reference in the theory of novel literature appreciation form, namely through analizing of conversation interfigure existing in it. Meanwhile, in the field sosiolinguistic this research study can treasure pragmatic especially the follow-illocutionary said based on form, function and the mode concept in accordance with the situation said. The practical results of this research {{can be used as a}} reference in the analysis of an alternative appreciation of literature. Research approach used was qualitative descriptive approach. Collecting data using a technique that involves the process of documentation and <b>record</b> <b>reading.</b> Data in this form of research tuturan illocutinary of the interfigure conversation in the novel of Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas from the text and the story is in the novel with the title "Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas.

Based on the analysis of data, obtained three illocutionary forms, five illocutiionary functions, two illocutionary modes characteristics and implications of illocutionary teaching literature appreciation in the novel of Midah Simanis Bergigi Emas. Three extant ilokusi is declaratif, imperatif and questioning, and the most dominant form is declaratif. Illocutionary the fifth function is found asertif, directive, expressive, and comisif declaration. Asertif functions include reporting, claims, and claims. Directive functions include ruled, commanded, ask, insist, recommend, demand, devise, and suggest. Expressive functions include blame, angry, worried, amazed and disappointed. Komisif function that includes a promise, offer, and threatening. Functions include the declaration, prohibit, recruit, and reject.

40|$|In {{spite of}} a voluminous {{bibliography}} on Juraj Julije Klović (1498 — 1578), there are nevertheless periods in his l ife which cannot be accounted for, contacts {{that have not been}} explored, and archival holdings not yet looked into. The aim of the present essay is to fill up this gap in part, There is first the problem of what the Croatian name of Georgius Iulius Clovius was. As there is no signature by his own hand nor a contemporaneous written record of his surname in a Croatian variant, there have been a series of attempts to reconstruct from the Latin and Italian variants (Clovius, Clovio) the Croatian form of Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname, Upon which in Klović 2 ̆ 7 s own native country was sought a name that might be most closely related to Klović 2 ̆ 7 s. Thus for the Croatian from of Clovius 2 ̆ 7 s surname the once or presently existing names in Klović 2 ̆ 7 s native country were suggested: Glović, Gobić, Kovičić, Klarić. The Croatian surname Klović is not {{to be found in the}} written records of the time in Klović 2 ̆ 7 s natlve country, As Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname occurs in his time also in the forms of Glovis and Glavis, this essay raises the query whether Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname in Croatian could have signified something that in its root concealed the meaning of key, s o that it was actually first translated into Latin es Clavis, which then, on account of the Italian eu. phony, passed into Clovio, which is possibly corroborated by Klović 2 ̆ 7 s cryptogram in Missal I. de Topusko. Or it may be that the ending of the surname in -ls, which is foreign to latinized Croatian surnemes, is actually a Greek or Grecized form. To be more explicit, Klovlć 2 ̆ 7 s father was a Macedonian«, and in the period under discussion it was possible to Include under this appellation also people of Greek, Albanian and Slavic nationalities, The existence of the Greek surname Klovius is noted by the Vatican Codex Vat. Graco 109, f. 79. The recently rediscovered charter of Cardinal Marin Grimani from 1538 brings Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname in the form of Clerouichius, a form whicT, however, might have been the scribe 2 ̆ 7 s error, for the word preceding the surname was clericus, so that -er in the surname might have been taken from the preceding word by error, in which stead. Clouichius ought to have stood, to which In Croatian Klović or even Klovičić would correspond. It may also be that the form Clerouichius represents the Macedonian. or Greek root of Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname. At any rate, of all Croatian and Greek variants of Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname that have been obtained through a recroatization or regrecization of the latinized forms of Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname, the advantage goes to the variant Klović. The author of the present essay suggests that Klović be called both by the surname Klović and by the artistic name by which he was known in the time in which he lived, to wit: Don Iulius Croata, similarly as Pietro Vanucoi was Pietro Perugino, and Paolo Cagliari Paolo Veronese. Thus in Croatian Clovius would be called thus: Juraj Julije Klović Hrvat (Croata). On his pictures Klović also signed himself as a Croat (Croata), and as a Macedonian (Macedo). The author of the essay sees no contradiction whatever in this, for Klović, as he had declared in his last will, was of a Macedonian father and. an Illyrian (Croatian) mother. As the artistic name, however, the word »Hrvat « (Croat) prevailed. The only written record on Klović 2 ̆ 7 s birthplace occurring in the second edition of Vasari 2 ̆ 7 s. Le vite., from i 568, states that Klović was born in the province of Croatia, in the diocese of Modruš,. in una villa detta Grisone. On the ground of studies on Vasari 2 ̆ 7 s • Le vite «and investigations on his literary legacy, the author of the present essay has established that Vasari must for certain have obtained Klović 2 ̆ 7 s biographic data either from Klović himself, or that they must have been authorized by Klović himself. To put i t more exactly, in the t ime when Vasari 2 ̆ 7 s »Le vite. had come into being, Klović was in connection with the author of »Le vite, Vasari, and with Vicenzo Borghini and Silvano Razzi, the correctors of the manuscript of Le vite. Taken all in all, the disputes regarding the reliability of Vasari 2 ̆ 7 s biographic data on Klović are quite graundless, According to Vasari, Klović 2 ̆ 7 s birthplace would be Grižane in Croatia, in the diocese of iModruš (which today is united with the srchdiocese of Rijeka. If under the name. villa detta Grisone. are to be understood the castle and estate of Griže, owned by the Frankopana or the Trsat Franciscans, then the tradition which still today lives in Klović 2 ̆ 7 s native country and which says that »a Friar and Frankopan. had discovered a gifted boy whom they gave an education, is quite understandable. If little Juraj Julije was born on a feudal estate, as a commoner naturally, this too would be in accord with the tradition according to which Klović was a child of poor parents who toiled on other people 2 ̆ 7 s soil. If under the appellation. villa detta Grisone the village of Grižane is meant, then, of course, these traditions cannot be precluded, and the query to be raised is, Where exactly was Klović born on the territory of Grižane? The traditions are at variance. Some place Klović 2 ̆ 7 s house of birth into Grižane 2 ̆ 7 s hamlets Antovo or Gobiće and poirrt to the foundations of some dilapidated house which was allegedly Klović 2 ̆ 7 s, while others hold that the village of Klarlći was Klović 2 ̆ 7 s birthplace, which does not lie at all on the territory of Grižane but on the territory of the adjacent village of Drivenik. They too would know the territory where Kiović 2 ̆ 7 s house of birth had stood. Still others believe that the village of Rudenice, which today belongs to Drivenik, is the birthplace of Klović, In the traditions relating to Klovlć 2 ̆ 7 s native country literary and original elements are intervowen. Of the traditions which the author of the present essay has recorded in Klović 2 ̆ 7 s native country it would seem that the one is the most original which expresses in folk language the miniaturistic talents of little Klović. Namely, the people, ignoring what miniaturistics spells, relate that little Juraj Julije had painted the Last Supper on one of his fingernails, while another variant has it that on a fingernail he had painted the Frankopan Castle Griže. Having noticed this, the Frias and Frankopan would have taken Klović to the Pauline Monastery at Crikvenica. The author of the present essay has investigated the archive of the Crikvenlca Paulines, but there is no trace of any record about Klović or the Pauline School, although the entire text makes it likely that Klović had received his first education from the Paulines of Crikvenica. Yet the possibility still remains that the Trsat Franciscans might have been concerned. Grižane, Klović 2 ̆ 7 s native place, was recorded not only by Vasari in print, but likewise by El Graco 2 ̆ 7 s brush, for accordigg to Lj. Babić, El Greco had contributed in Klović 2 ̆ 7 s portrait also a picture of the Grižane landscape. The author of this essay made a study of the Archive of the Congregation of the Lateran Regular Canons of St. Redeemer in Rome — Archivum pretiosum Congregationis Sanctissimi Salvatoris Canonicorum regularium Laterenensium in Urbe«. In the old inventory of the Archive is to be found also a written <b>record</b> <b>reading,.</b> Giullo Clovio P. Inf, 7 (2 ?) •. What had been contained here is not certain. Maybe the truth ought to be sought in the yet non-arranged part of the Archive. In the Codex »A 955 : Notae historicae Saneti Petri in vinculis i s t o be found an abstract from a charter on Klović from the year 1536. Under the signature M 665 there is a charter issued by Cardinal Marin Grimani on the 24 th August, 1536, at Perugia, to the following addressee:... di lecto nobis in Christo Georgio alias lulio clerico clerouichio de crouatia professori ac familiari nostro continuo commensali. Because of the conformity of the name (Juraj Julije), native land (Croatia), monastic belonging (Order of Regular Canons), place and Maecenas (Perugia, Cardinal Grimani), it was concluded that Klović was in question. However, the name Clerouichius is either the rull form of Klović 2 ̆ 7 s surname, which had not been used in unabbreviated form except in documents, or will most probably be an error committeed by the scribe on account of cler. in the name of the preceding word. The appellation »professor«may mean the monastic profession of the vow, that is, the status In the Order, but might well have meant the teacher. Maybe these are coincidences in respect of Klović, that is, that he was both a professor by monastic belonging and a professor by his teaching activities at Candiana and other monasteries, where, as evidenced by the Constitution of the Order from 1592, free skills and sacral sciences would have been taught. The benefice Klović had received through this charter was the parish church of St. Bartholomew, Castel Rigone, Perugia. By the very fact that Klović was appointed director and possessor of the parish :hurch, he will probably have been released ipso iure from his vows as a friar, transforming from a monastic into a lay priest. In the archival holdings of St. Sebastian at Mantua there Is no mention of Klović, truc, but there is a record of the numerical state of the monastery 2 ̆ 7 in the time when Klović joined it (Codex A 378), while another inventory, although one whole century after Klović 2 ̆ 7 s coming to that monastery, notes several miniatures, for which it i s not imposslble that they were by Klović (Codex A 376). Owing to the fact that Klović had left his body in chains to the Basilica of St. Peter to be buried, and some of his movable objects such as pictures, large and small, to the church and the vestry as an inalienable decoration, the writer of this essay came through his investigations to the following conclusion: Klović 2 ̆ 7 s bones remained in the basilica, but they were placed into a common ossuary, which now lies in the crypt of the basilica beneath the right-hand aisle between the first and second altars from the entrsnce door. In the inventories of the Archive of the Regular Canons there is no trace of the pictures that Klovlć had left to the church and the vestry. However, there is uncertainty as to whose are the pictures on the altar which lies between Michelangelo 2 ̆ 7 s Moses and Klović 2 ̆ 7 s memorial tablet. Furthermore, in the old vestry, which is not accessible to the public, one may find a number of pictures, large and small (numbered), which ought to be investigated as to whether they might come from Klović 2 ̆ 7 s legacy. Klović had willed to the Church»leatae Mariae consolationls de Vrbe unum offitium parvulum antiquum Dive Marie in parte miniatum quod modo penes se habere dixit perhaps for the reason that he might have belonged to the society of that hospital and church, and also maybe because he was treated in the hospital. La Consolazione, which was near the FarKlović was in contact with Girolamo Dai Libri, Bartolomeo, Sebastiano Luciani del Piombo, Torri (whose teacher he was), Silvano Razzi, Miniato Pitti, Vincenzo Bor ghini, Francesco de Medici, Giorgio Vasari and, as we know, El Greco. The author of the preserrt essay is also concerned with these contacts as they were recorded in the time of Klović 2 ̆ 7 s life. The author of the essay also investigated holdings in the secret archive of the Vatican that would maybe contain some data by Klović or on Klović. They are Garte Farnesiane and Fondo Pio (Vols. 56 and 57). The result was negative, most likely for the reason that, as an inmate of Cardinal Farnese, Klović was not in touch by correspondence with him...|$|E
