50|$|The <b>{{regulated}}</b> <b>dams</b> {{under the}} 1975 Reservoir Act are the Model Pond and the Men's Bathing Pond in the Highgate Chain. Highgate Number 1 pond {{would have been}} covered by the Act but the water level was lowered by the GLC in 1984. In the Hampstead chain, Hampstead Number 1 pond is also regulated under the 1975 Act.|$|R
50|$|The Commission {{has been}} {{involved}} in how the Souris River and Red River systems are shared among Saskatchewan, Manitoba and North Dakota. It also sets emergency water levels for the Rainy Lake system, including the Lake of the Woods, which crosses through Minnesota, Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario. Protection of Rainy River water quality is also addressed by the IJC. In the east, the Commission <b>regulates</b> <b>dams</b> and protects the water quality on the St. Croix River, which flows through New Brunswick and Maine.|$|R
50|$|The {{flow of the}} Verma {{river is}} <b>regulated</b> by <b>dams</b> and used at the Verma power station (originally built in 1923, {{expanded}} in 1953). The dam is about 420 meters above the power station. About 70 GWh are produced annually.|$|R

5000|$|Downstream, 2.5 mi north, a <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> {{controls}} the river flow. The area between {{is called the}} Pelton Regulating Reservoir. In 1982 the Confederated Tribes of Warm Springs installed a hydroelectric turbine unit in the <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> for additional power. [...] Between 2000 and 2005 the CTWS also asserted itself as a stakeholder in the project's re-licensing negotiations between Portland General Electric and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, winning key environmental, cultural, and water rights concessions.|$|E
50|$|The Flumenthal Dam is a <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> at Flumenthal, Switzerland, {{which was}} erected {{as the most}} {{important}} element of all the works of the Second Jura water correction. It was built to regulate the outflow of Seeland's three-lake hydrologic system as far downstream as Solothurn and the confluence with the river Emme River. It works in conjunction with the <b>Regulating</b> <b>Dam</b> Port at Seeland. The works started in 1966, and the dam and adjoining downstream hydroelecric power station were commissioned in 1970.|$|E
50|$|In Kymijoki, {{there are}} 12 {{hydroelectric}} plants and several <b>dams</b> to <b>regulate</b> the water level. The first power plants were built is 1882. The canal and dam at Kalkkinen {{is used to}} regulate the water level of Lake Päijänne. The Hirvivuolle <b>Dam</b> <b>regulates</b> water flow between eastern and western branches. The Paaskoski <b>Dam</b> near Tammijärvi <b>regulates</b> the flow into the Klåsarö branch and the Strömfors <b>Dam</b> <b>regulates</b> the water level of the Strömfors industrial area.|$|R
40|$|The main {{aim of the}} {{research}} was to identify the impact of hydrotechnical structures on the course of hydrographs of extreme water levels of canalized part of Brda River. The studies were made in order to evaluate the water management. Also they allowed to determine flood risk in the city of Bydgoszcz. The analyses were carried out on the basis of observations of water levels at the weir Czersko Polskie, which is <b>regulating</b> <b>damming</b> on the end part of the Brda River. However, a large influence on the hydrological situation in the analyzed section of Brda River have the water level of the Vistula River. It can caused a specific type of water damming of the Brda River, causing flooding of riverside areas in the centre of Bydgoszcz...|$|R

This thesis has evaluated four fishways in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland and provided new information for 51 migratory fish species. Fishways will be crucial for management and conservation of biodiversity...|$|R
50|$|The Flumenthal dam {{was erected}} in the 1970s on river Aare during the Second Jura water {{correction}} {{in order to}} regulate {{the waters of the}} Seeland's three lakes hydrological system further downstream of the <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> Port.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the Status {{sets the}} speed that the Aare should not exceed. If the flow {{increases}} too much, then the <b>Regulating</b> <b>Dam</b> Port must limit {{the flow of}} the Aare upstream, using the three lakes to absorb the crest of the flood, until the Emme's overflow subsides.|$|E
50|$|The river flows out of {{the lake}} in Biel/Bienne and after 2 km merges {{directly}} into the Nidau-Büren channel, which was also dug out during the Jura water correction, ensuring the outflow of River Aare, just before the <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> in Port which was commissioned in 1939. Before, La Thielle used to flow into the River Aare 7 km further downstream {{in the vicinity of}} Büren-an-der Aare.|$|E
50|$|The {{river flow}} is <b>regulated</b> by the <b>dam</b> at Orto-Tokoy Reservoir in Kyrgyzstan built in 1957, and the dam at Tasotkel Reservoir in Kazakhstan built in 1974.|$|R
50|$|Water flow {{downstream}} will be <b>regulated</b> by the <b>dam</b> {{which is}} expected to result in low releases (6 m3/s) during winter and very high releases (2,560 m3/s) when energy is being generated.|$|R
50|$|The {{water in}} the Niger River basin is {{partially}} <b>regulated</b> through <b>dams.</b> In Mali the Sélingué Dam on the Sankarani River is mainly used for hydropower, but also permits irrigation. Two diversion dams, one at Sotuba just downstream of Bamako, and one at Markala, just downstream of Ségou, are used to irrigate about 54,000 hectares. In Nigeria the Kainji Dam and the Jebba dam are used to generate hydropower.|$|R
50|$|The town {{lies on the}} Nidau-Büren channel, which links Lake Biel with Solothurn, dug {{out during}} the Jura water correction. Since then the {{community}} has been split into two parts {{on either side of}} the canal. The <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> Port, commissioned in 1939 and a small foot bridge, erected in the 1980s, connect both sides. The municipality stretches from the channel to the slopes of the Jensberg hill.|$|E
50|$|Thus, the Status {{sets the}} speed that the Aare should not exceed: if the flow {{increases}} too much, then the <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> Port must limit {{the flow of}} the Aare river upstream, the three Seeland lakes being used to absorb the crest of the flood, {{until the end of the}} overflow of the Emme river. The system was complemented by the Flumenthal dam during the Second Jura water correction.|$|E
50|$|In {{report by}} Philippine Daily Inquirer {{reporter}} Niña Calleja {{in that same}} month, MWSS senior deputy administrator Nathaniel Santos indicated that the main difference of the NCWSP from previous plans {{was that it would}} involve the construction of two smaller dams at the Kaliwa watershed instead of just the one. A main dam (Laiban Dam) would be built at the upper Kaliwa River in Barangay Laiban, and another <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> (Kaliwa Low Dam) further downstream.|$|E
50|$|Skjærsjøen is a {{regulated}} lake in Nordmarka, Oslo, Norway. It drains {{through the}} river Skjærsjøelva to Maridalsvannet, and also via tubes to the Hammeren Hydroelectric Power Station. It is <b>regulated</b> by the <b>dam</b> Skjærsjødammen from 1890.|$|R
5000|$|The dam helps control {{floods in}} the Mahanadi delta and irrigates 75000 km2 of land. Hydroelectricity is also generated. The Hirakud <b>Dam</b> <b>regulates</b> 83,400 km2 of Mahanadi's drainage. The {{reservoir}} has a storage capacity of [...] with gross of [...]|$|R
5000|$|Located near Vandalia, Ohio, Taylorsville <b>Dam</b> <b>regulates</b> the Great Miami River. It {{consists}} of [...] of earth, is 67 ft high and spans 2980 ft. When full, the dam would inundate 9,650 acre (39 km²). It {{was constructed in}} 1919.|$|R
50|$|The cantons of Vaud, Neuchatel and Fribourg {{asked for}} its replacement, {{but it was}} only modified, in 1911 and 1915. Finally, the {{building}} of the new <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> was started in Port in 1936, and completed and commissioned in 1939. This dam ensures the level control of the three lakes, as well as the flow of the Aare. The three lakes act as a buffer zone absorbing the waters of the Aare in the event of any upstream flooding.|$|E
5000|$|Finally, the {{building}} of the new <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> was started in Port in 1936, and it was completed and commissioned in 1939 and has been daily in use ever since. The dam includes a 12 x 25 m lock that is large enough for tour boats that run between Biel and Solothurn. In 1995 a hydroelectric plant was added to the lock. This plant, located near Brügg produces an average of 25 Million Kilowatt-hours per year.|$|E
5000|$|It {{takes its}} source in a moorland at over 900 metres of {{altitude}}, {{in the high}} valley of Les Convers, (see: Renan). It flows down the whole length of the valley of Saint-Imier, (Erguel), leaving it through the gorge of Taubenloch, it flows across the city of Biel/Bienne into the Lake of Bienne, at the altitude of 429 metres, upon a stretch of 45 kilometres. It leaves it through {{the last leg of}} the Thielle river, merging into the Nidau-Büren channel (Aare river), just before the <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> Port [...]|$|E
50|$|Galanta District (okres Galanta) is a {{district}} inthe Trnava Region of western Slovakia. The district {{lies on the}} lowland area. Through the district area flows River Váh and its level is <b>regulated</b> by <b>dam</b> in Kráľová nad Váhom. Historically {{the economy of the}} district area had relied on agriculture, now the production of white goods is of utmost importance. The district center is its largest town Galanta and there are 36 municipalities, in three of them are towns.|$|R
40|$|For decades, a dam {{was located}} on the Souhegan River, roughly 1, 800 feet {{upstream}} of its confluence with the Merrimack River. The dam, known locally as the Merrimack Village Dam (MVD), was located in a highly visible location in Merrimack, NH. The former owner of MVD, Pennichuck Water Works (Pennichuck), is a water supply company who purchased the dam in the 1960 s as a potential water supply source, {{but it was never}} developed. In the mid 2000 s, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) who <b>regulated</b> <b>dam</b> safety, issued Pennichuck a letter highlighting several deficiencies with the dam requiring extensive costs. NHDES also indicated that as an option to repairing the dam, they offer a program to assist owners with removing dams. After weighing the cost associated with dam repair, on-going liability, on-going operation and maintenance costs and the ecological restoration benefits, Pennichuck opted to conduct a feasibility study to determine if it was practical to remove the structure. Pennichuck applied and received numerous grants to help partially defray the cost of conducting a feasibility study and the eventual removal of a 20 -foot high, 180 foot-long concrete and stone masonry dam in 2008...|$|R
5000|$|Located near Fairborn, Ohio, Huffman <b>Dam</b> <b>regulates</b> {{the flow}} of the Mad River into the Great Miami River. It {{consists}} of [...] of earth, is 65 ft high and spans 3340 ft. The dam can contain [...] of flood water over 7300 acre.|$|R
5000|$|Finally, the {{building}} of the new <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> was started in Port in 1936, and completed and commissioned in 1939. This dam ensures the level control of the three lakes of Neuchâtel, Morat and Bienne, an area so called the [...] "Seeland”,as well as the outflow of the Aare river downstream toward Solothurn, Aargau and the junction with Emme River down to the merging with the Rhine River. The three lakes act as a buffer zone, absorbing waters of the Aare in the event of any upstream flooding as far as the lakes Thun and Brienz and of course “Grand Marais”.|$|E
50|$|The Orbe has {{its source}} near Rousses, forms the lac des Rousses before flowing down to lac de Joux in Canton of Vaud, Switzerland. It disappears {{naturally}} underground for {{a stretch of}} 4 km, to reappear in Vallorbe - where a special ecotourism site was created, the Vallorbe Caves (note, to re-edit - http://www.grottesdevallorbe.ch/). Soon after, in Orbe, the river merges with the Talent and takes the name of Thielle. Flowing through Yverdon-les-Bains, it joins the lac de Neuchâtel. It flows out of it through the Thielle channel to the Nidau-Büren channel in Nidau, just before the <b>regulating</b> <b>dam</b> Port established between Port and Brügg that controls the levels of the three lakes of Seeland.|$|E
50|$|Many small {{diversion}} dams {{block the}} Merced River downstream, {{many of which}} were built by the Merced Irrigation District to supply water to farms in the Central Valley. The lowermost, the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, was built just before 1907, and completely blocks the passage of anadromous fish up the Merced River. McSwain Dam, the other major lower dam, also serves as a forebay (<b>regulating</b> <b>dam)</b> for New Exchequer Dam. Aside from controlling flows in the lower river the dam also produces some hydroelectricity. Because of the nearly desiccated flow of the river as it nears the mouth, like most other rivers in the San Joaquin Valley, little water in the Merced River actually reaches the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
50|$|A smaller pond, {{called the}} Dartmouth <b>Dam</b> <b>Regulating</b> Pond or Banimboola Pondage, {{approximately}} 9 km downstream {{of the main}} dam, also across the Mitta Mitta River, is located adjacent the Banimboola Hydroelectric Power Station and forms part of the Dartmouth Dam complex of facilities.|$|R
50|$|Dickson <b>Dam</b> <b>regulates</b> {{the flow}} of the Red Deer River to control for floods and low winter flows, to improve quality of the river, to create a {{recreational}} resource and to provide a reliable, year-round water supply sufficient for future industrial, regional and municipal growth.|$|R
50|$|Since the Second Jura water correction, the Murgenthal Status {{regulates the}} maximum and minimum {{levels of the}} three lakes, {{as well as the}} maximum outflow downstream.
