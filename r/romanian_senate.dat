25|$|In December 2011, the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> {{unanimously}} {{adopted the}} draft law ratifying the Romania-United States agreement signed in September {{of the same}} year that would allow the establishment and operation of a US land-based ballistic missile defence system in Romania as part of NATO's efforts to build a continental missile shield.|$|E
25|$|The {{new regime}} was an authoritarian one, {{centered}} on Carol II, and {{confirmed by the}} 1938 Constitution of Romania. Parliament was practically dissolved, but, as a long-time member of the former Assembly, Gherman Pântea was assigned a permanent seat in the reorganized <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate.</b> Following Carol's administrative restructuring, he was also named counsel at the superior court of Ținutul Nistru. He was at odds with Grigore Cazacliu, the King's Resident (Governor), accusing him of dishonest business practices.|$|E
25|$|Isopescu-Grecul {{received}} in Vienna the Transylvanian Iuliu Maniu, {{of the more}} powerful Romanian National Party (PNR). Together, they visited General Stöger-Steiner, nominally {{in charge of the}} War Ministry, and demanded direct control over Romanian units in the Common Army. Stöger yielded within the hour, although he admitted that he no longer controlled the troops, which answered to a revolutionary committee. With this, the <b>Romanian</b> Military <b>Senate</b> took charge of public order in Vienna, reorganizing troops on national grounds and under a Romanian flag.|$|R

50|$|In 2009-2010, a media {{campaign}} {{followed by a}} parliamentarian initiative asked the Romanian Parliament to accept a proposal to change back the official name of country's Roma (adopted in 2000) to Țigan (Gypsy), the traditional and colloquial Romanian name for Romani, {{in order to avoid}} the possible confusion among the international community between the words Roma — which refers to the Romani ethnic minority — and Romania. The Romanian government supported the move on the grounds that many countries in the European Union use a variation of the word Țigan to refer to their Gypsy populations. The <b>Romanian</b> upper house, <b>Senate,</b> rejected the proposal.|$|R
25|$|On 28 June 2010, the Senate of Romania {{adopted a}} {{resolution}} {{on the situation}} in Georgia, reaffirming its support for Georgia's territorial integrity and recognizing the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia as integral parts of Georgia. The Senate condemned the recognition of Georgia's breakaway regions by a number of countries and emphasized the necessity of complying with the six-point ceasefire agreement of 12 August 2008. The <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> supported the Georgian Government's strategy with respect to the occupied territories. It condemned the continuation of the policy of changing the ethnic composition in the two regions and insisted on ensuring the unhindered return of refugees.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, he was {{involved}} in nationalist politics, supporting Alexandru Averescu, Nicolae Iorga and, ultimately, the extremist Iron Guard, of which he was among the most prominent intellectual backers. A theoretician of organicism, corporatism, and antisemitism, he inspired the creation of Iconar, a literary society, and founded the review Însemnări Sociologice. He was elected to the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1937, and reached the apex of his political career during the short-lived National Legionary State of 1940–1941. He served as Education and Arts Minister under this regime, targeting the country's Jewish community and his various political opponents. In the wake of the Legionnaires' rebellion, he was arrested, tried and acquitted, but later arrested again and interned.|$|E
25|$|Batzaria {{eventually}} {{settled in}} Romania {{and became a}} prolific contributor to Romanian letters, producing works of genre fiction and children's literature. Together with comic strip artist Marin Iorda, he created Haplea, {{one of the most}} popular characters in early Romanian comics. Batzaria also collected and retold fairy tales from various folkloric traditions, while publishing original novels for adolescents and memoirs of his life in Macedonia. A member of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> for one term, he was active on the staff of Romania's leading left-wing journals, Adevărul and Dimineața, as well as founder of the latter's supplement for children, before switching his allegiance to the right-wing Universul. Batzaria was persecuted and imprisoned by the communist regime, and spent his final years in obscure captivity.|$|E

2500|$|Authorities prosecuted {{those arrested}} (as many as 300 in one account) in the Dealul Spirii Trial, and {{attempted}} to connect them with Max Goldstein, a terrorist of uncertain affiliation who had detonated a bomb inside the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> on December 8, 1920. Charges {{were based on the}} group's rejection of Greater Romania and their advocacy of [...] "World revolution", which had raised suspicion that they were trying to overthrow the existing order through actions such as Goldstein's. In technical terms, this was formulated by the prosecutors as: ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2006, Macovei {{appointed}} 33-year-old lawyer Laura Kövesi as Prosecutor General [...] In February 2007, the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> Judicial Commission, however, {{voted to}} remove {{the authority of the}} Minister of Justice to nominate the Prosecutor General. The commission instead proposed assigning full authority over the nomination to the Superior Council of Magistrates (CSM). Macovei said that the Senate's measure, if approved by the full Parliament, would greatly impede the government's ability to combat corruption as the Prosecutor General is a central figure in that effort.|$|E
2500|$|Cristea {{strongly}} opposed {{the idea of}} a Concordat with the Vatican and the Romanian Orthodox Church issued a statement against it saying that [...] "the treaty subordinates the interests of the country and the sovereignty of the state to a foreign power". The <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> ratified it anyway on May 26, 1929, and Cristea, {{as a member of the}} regency, was forced to sign it. This has led again to discussions about the incompatibility between his two posts and there were discussions on whether Cristea would have resigned rather than sign the Concordat.|$|E
2500|$|The Sanielevicis {{were heavily}} {{involved}} in supporting the newly emancipated Jewish community of Greater Romania. Iosif Sanielevici was a Jewish member of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> in the 1922 legislature, and noted for his interventions in legislating medical practice. In 1926, Adevărul Literar şi Artistic published Henric Sanielevici's inquiry into the Jewish origins of Vasile Alecsandri, the celebrated founder of 19th-century Moldavian Romanticism. A significant part of Sanielevici's press contributions was dedicated to uncovering the Jewish roots of some eminently Romanian authors: he claimed that all people {{by the name of}} Botez (literally, [...] "baptism"), including poet Demostene Botez, were converted Jews.|$|E
2500|$|A regency, which {{included}} his uncle, Prince Nicolae, Patriarch Miron Cristea, and the country's Chief Justice (Gheorghe Buzdugan, and from October 1929, Constantin Sărățeanu) functioned {{on behalf of}} the 5-year-old Michael, when he succeeded Ferdinand in 1927. In 1930, Carol II returned to the country at the invitation of politicians dissatisfied with the Regency {{in the context of the}} Great Depression, and was proclaimed king by the Parliament. Michael was designated as Crown Prince with the title [...] "Grand Voievod of Alba-Iulia". In November 1939, Michael joined the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate,</b> as the 1938 Constitution guaranteed him a seat there upon reaching the age of eighteen.|$|E
2500|$|As of 2009, Lungu's {{work had}} been {{translated}} into nine languages, including a critically acclaimed French-language version of Raiul găinilor (Le paradis des poules, Éditions Jacqueline Chambon, 2005). In its Spanish translation, published in 2009, Sînt o babă comunistă! was included by El País daily in a [...] "best of" [...] chart for humorous literature. Also in 2009, a chart compiled by the satirical and lifestyle magazine Academia Cațavencu ranked Lungu 46th among the [...] "50 sexiest Romanian intellectuals". During the 2016 parliamentary election, Lungu ran for and won {{a seat in the}} <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> on the lists of the Save Romania Union. He subsequently left his prior position as director of the Museum of Romanian Literature.|$|E
2500|$|Brăileanu {{was sent}} to the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> {{following}} the general election of December 1937. This had resulted in minority rule by a LANC successor, the National Christian Party (PNC), with the king's endorsement. Writing in Însemnări Sociologice in January 1938, Brăileanu complained that the PNC's antisemitic program was incomplete, since it failed to target liberal democracy, [...] "that which has made kikes all-powerful". The LANC, he noted, had been too moderate, [...] "demagogic and corrupt"; the Iron Guard would need to reemerge and [...] "turn chaos to order". He nevertheless displayed his and his party's loyalty toward the king, explaining for Buna Vestire that [...] "the monarch represents the supreme principle of order and the political hierarchy".|$|E
2500|$|The {{initiative}} regarding founding the Prize [...] "Valeriu Boboc" [...] for {{the liberty}} of press and defending of democratic values was launched on April 19, 2010 by the Romanian senator Mihaela Popa. She said {{in front of the}} Senate that [...] "April 7 events opened the way of Moldova to Europe and Boboc is no longer just a name, but a symbol of struggle for democratic values and freedom of expression." [...] On April 23, the newspaper of a former ally of Communists Iurie Roşca, Flux, had a very hostile reaction to the initiative. The memorandum regarding founding the Prize [...] "Valeriu Boboc" [...] for {{the liberty of}} press and defending of democratic values was adopted on April 30, 2010 by the permanent bureau of the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In its 2007 {{annual report}} on Romania, Reporters without Borders {{characterized}} as [...] "encouraging" [...] {{reform of the}} Romanian penal code initiated by Macovei that would decriminalize defamation and libel. Macovei said the proposed reformed code, which included many other changes and had been posted on the [...] for public debate, was necessary for modernizing Romania's legal system and to comply with EU norms. It would replace a draft penal code passed into law in 2004, but never enacted, under former Justice Minister and subsequent Conservative Party Senator Rodica Stănoiu. [...] The <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> disagreed and, in February 2007, passed a measure to enact the so-called [...] "Stănoiu Code" [...] instead of Macovei's penal code. Macovei said the [...] "Stănoiu Code," [...] if passed by the full Parliament, would bring Romanian penal justice to a halt. [...] Macovei {{was supported by the}} European Commission in the debate, and the Stănoiu Code was not implemented.|$|E
2500|$|On February 13, 2007 the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> {{passed by}} secret ballot a simple motion calling for Macovei's resignation. The measure, titled [...] "Lying - Macovei's Way of Justice," [...] {{was the first}} such motion ever passed in the Romanian Parliament against an {{individual}} cabinet member. It was supported by 81 senators out of 137. The motion accused Macovei of delaying justice reform (including application of the 2004 Penal Code), intervening in the judicial process, facilitating the release of several criminals, and attacking activities of the Parliament. It also called for measures guaranteeing the independence of judges and prosecutors from political influence. [...] The vote was tabled by the Conservative Party, {{with support from the}} other opposition parties, primarily the Social Democratic Party (PSD) and the nationalist Greater Romania Party. [...] The number of votes against Macovei on the measure indicated that many Senators from her own center-right governing bloc did not support her.|$|E
2500|$|Cristescu led the faction that {{separated}} itself after the Party's Congress of 8–12 May 1921, and was elected {{as the first}} {{general secretary of the}} newly formed Socialist-Communist Party (soon to be the Romanian Communist Party). Those maximalists who had designated themselves as [...] "communists" [...] (including Gheorghe Cristescu) were arrested and indicted in the Dealul Spirii Trial: Romanian authorities attempted to connect them with Max Goldstein, a terrorist of uncertain affiliation who had detonated a bomb inside the <b>Romanian</b> <b>Senate</b> on December 8, 1920. The charge against the communists was based on their rejection of Greater Romania as a concept, and their commitment to [...] "world revolution" [...] and the Comintern, which raised suspicion that they were trying to overthrow the existing order through actions such as that of Goldstein. Constantin Argetoianu, Interior Minister in the second Alexandru Averescu cabinet and main instigator of the arrest, later admitted that his order lacked legal grounds, and stated that he had given Cristescu approval to hold congress with the knowledge that Comintern policies were to be submitted to a vote, thus causing the faction to incriminate itself.|$|E
