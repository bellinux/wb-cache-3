5|$|In 1936, Ayer wrote Language, Truth and Logic, {{in which}} he claimed that {{religious}} language is meaningless. He put forward a strong empirical position, arguing that all knowledge must either come from observations of the world or be necessarily true, like mathematical statements. In doing so, he rejected metaphysics, which considers the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> world beyond the natural world and science. Because {{it is based on}} metaphysics and is therefore unverifiable, Ayer denounced religious language, as well as statements about ethics or aesthetics, as meaningless. Ayer challenged the meaningfulness of all statements about God– theistic, atheistic and agnostic– arguing that they are all equally meaningless because they all discuss the existence of a metaphysical, unverifiable being.|$|E

25|$|According to Rand, {{attaining}} knowledge {{beyond what}} is given in perception requires both volition (or the exercise of free will) and adherence to a specific method of validation through observation, concept-formation, {{and the application of}} inductive and deductive reasoning. For example, a belief in dragons, however sincere, does not mean reality contains any dragons. A process of proof identifying the basis in <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> claimed item of knowledge is necessary to establish its truth.|$|E
25|$|Dein and Littlewood (2008) {{suggest that}} an individual’s prayer {{life can be}} viewed on a {{spectrum}} ranging from immature to mature. A progression on the scale {{is characterized by a}} change in the perspective of the purpose of prayer. Rather than using prayer as a means of changing the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> situation, a more mature individual will use prayer to request assistance in coping with immutable problems and draw closer to God or others. This change in perspective {{has been shown to be}} associated with an individual’s passage through adolescence.|$|E
25|$|According to some scholars, the Buddha nature {{which these}} sutras discuss, does not {{represent}} a substantial self (ātman). Rather, it is a positive expression of emptiness, and represents the potentiality to realize Buddhahood through Buddhist practices. In this view, {{the intention of the}} teaching of Buddha nature is soteriological rather than theoretical. According to others, the potential of salvation depends on the ontological <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> salvific, abiding core reality — the Buddha-nature, empty of all mutability and error, fully present within all beings.|$|E

25|$|The {{process of}} Magyarization {{did not succeed}} in {{imposing}} the Hungarian language as the most used language in all territories in the Kingdom of Hungary. In fact the profoundly multinational character of historic Transylvania was reflected in the fact that during the fifty years of the dual monarchy, the spread of Hungarian as the second language remained limited. In 1880, 5.7% of the non-Hungarian population, or 109,190 people, claimed to have a knowledge of the Hungarian language; the proportion rose to 11% (183,508) in 1900, and to 15.2% (266,863) in 1910. These figures reveal the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bygone era, one in which millions of people could conduct their lives without speaking the state's official language. The policies of Magyarization aimed to have a Hungarian language surname as a requirement for access to basic government services such as local administration, education, and justice.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{publication}} of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species in 1859, {{the position of the}} Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has slowly been refined. For about 100 years, there was no authoritative pronouncement on the subject, though many hostile comments were made by local church figures. In contrast with many Protestant objections, Catholic issues with evolutionary theory have {{had little to do with}} maintaining the literalism of the account in the Book of Genesis, and have always been concerned with the question of how man came to have a soul. Modern Creationism has had little Catholic support. In the 1950s, the Church's position was one of neutrality; by the late 20th century its position evolved to one of general acceptance in recent years. However, the church insists that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> single ancestor (commonly called monogenism) for the human race.|$|E
25|$|Roman Catholic Eucharistic Doctrine {{draws upon}} a quasi-Aristotelian {{understanding}} of reality, {{in which the}} core substance or essential <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given thing is bound to, but not equivalent with, its sensible realities or accidents. In {{the celebration of the}} Eucharist, by means of the consecratory Eucharistic Prayer, the actual substance of the bread and wine are changed into the body and blood of Christ. This change in substance is not, however, a physical change; the physical aspects or outward appearances of the bread and wine—their accidents—remain as before. This substantial change is called transubstantiation, a term reserved to describe the change itself. Protestant views on the fact of Christ's presence in the Eucharist vary significantly from one denomination to another: while many, such as Lutherans, Anglicans, Methodists and the Reformed agree with Roman Catholics that Christ is really present in the Eucharist, they do not accept the definition of transubstantiation to describe it.|$|E

25|$|In {{some large}} houses from the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, enormous and ingenious efforts of building and design were employed to keep the staff out of sight. The service wings were often only accessed by underground tunnels as at Rockingham house and Castle Coole, both, in Ireland. At Mentmore Towers, where the service wing is a large block the same size as the mansion itself, the main part of the house is built on artificially raised ground allowing it to tower over the service wings which are in <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> near similar height. The only windows to Mentmore's service wings were to an inner courtyard, thus preventing the servant's looking out on their employers, or their employers catching accidental sight of them. The outer, but blind, walls of the wings are of attractive dressed Ancaster stone adorned with niches and statuary, while the inner courtyard visible only to the servants is of common yellow brick. However the majority of the wing is hidden by dense planting.|$|E
25|$|All that exists, {{throughout}} all time and beyond, is one infinite divine Consciousness, free and blissful, which projects {{within the field}} of its awareness a vast multiplicity of apparently differentiated subjects and objects: each object an actualization of a timeless potentiality inherent in the Light of Consciousness, and each subject the same plus a contracted locus of self-awareness. This creation, a divine play, {{is the result of the}} natural impulse within Consciousness to express the totality of its self-knowledge in action, an impulse arising from love. The unbounded Light of Consciousness contracts into finite embodied loci of awareness out of its own free will. When those finite subjects then identify with the limited and circumscribed cognitions and circumstances that make up this phase of their existence, instead of identifying with the transindividual overarching pulsation of pure Awareness that is their true nature, they experience what they call “suffering.” To rectify this, some feel an inner urge to take up the path of spiritual gnosis and yogic practice, the purpose of which is to undermine their misidentification and directly reveal within the immediacy of awareness the fact that the divine powers of Consciousness, Bliss, Willing, Knowing, and Acting comprise the totality of individual experience as well—thereby triggering a recognition that one’s real identity is that of the highest Divinity, the Whole in every part. This experiential gnosis is repeated and reinforced through various means until it becomes the nonconceptual ground of every moment of experience, and one’s contracted sense of self and separation from the Whole is finally annihilated in the incandescent radiance of the complete expansion into perfect wholeness. Then one’s perception fully encompasses the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universe dancing ecstatically in the animation of its completely perfect divinity.|$|E

500|$|Curtis was the group's sole lyricist.

Imagery and words revolving around [...] "coldness, pressure, darkness, crisis, failure, collapse, loss of control" [...] recur in his songs. In 1979, NME journalist Paul Rambali wrote, [...] "The themes of Joy Division's music are sorrowful, painful and sometimes deeply sad." [...] Music journalist Jon Savage wrote that [...] "Curtis's great lyrical achievement was to capture the underlying <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> society in turmoil, {{and to make it}} both universal and personal," [...] while noting that [...] "the lyrics reflected, in mood and approach, his interest in romantic and science-fiction literature." [...] Musicologist Robert Palmer wrote that William S. Burroughs and J. G. Ballard were [...] "obvious influences" [...] to Curtis, and Morris also remembered the singer reading T. S. Eliot. Deborah Curtis also remembered Curtis reading works by writers such as Fyodor Dostoevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Jean-Paul Sartre, Franz Kafka, and Hermann Hesse..|$|E

[...] Sets {{for the series}} were constructed in a former supermarket warehouse in Burnaby, including a [...] "23,000-square-foot set" [...] for the interior of Clockworks Mental Hospital. Wylie called this the most complicated set, and felt [...] "trying to make a hospital feel fun is a perfect challenge." [...] The most difficult set for Wylie to create was the ice room inhabited by Oliver Bird in the astral plane, which he had to create in seven days. Wylie initially looked to have the set built by [...] "those people who make giant sheets of ice for ice sculptures and stuff", before eventually building the set out of visqueen. However, this did not work, and was a [...] "gigantic disappointment". Wylie had the set rebuilt within a week, with the second version using acrylic molded to look like thick sheets of ice. Another notable set featured a giant volume knob which Haller turns to [...] "control {{the volume of the}} voices he hears in his head". This was compared to the effects of films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Incredible Shrinking Man, and described by Gonzales as [...] "classic Noah Hawley". The sequence was filmed at the end of production on the season, and added to the second episode. All of Wylie's sets were built with [...] "external lighting features" [...] that could be controlled from a board, allowing the cinematographers to be flexible with lighting [...] "given that the <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> location can change drastically depending on our main character’s perceptions and actions." ...|$|E

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximately}} 1,000 feet long, {{was released}} on November 4, 1910. The film was released outside of the planned order due to a scheduling conflict. Originally The American and the Queen was planned to be released on this date, but it was instead pushed back to November 11. The film received mixed reviews from critics, H. Jeanval of The Moving Picture News stated that the costuming and lace curtains on {{the windows of the}} home betrayed the supposed poverty of the Morgan family. Walton, also of The Moving Picture News, stated, [...] "This title would be completely misunderstood by the majority of moving picture show attendants. Some sporadic 'reformer' who does not know the original and who has never seen the film will fill 'space' on the iniquity of moving pictures founded on this title. If he did see the film it has not the necessary power to grapple with the terrible <b>reality</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> too common incident in daily life." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was more picky in its wording and praise, stating: [...] "It was to be supposed that some company would finally present this familiar drama in pictorial form, and a reviewer must feel glad that it is over, for the film doesn't materially exalt the level of film output." [...] The review found the acting to be good, but found fault {{in the shadows of the}} actors fell towards a lamp instead of away from it. The New York Dramatic Mirror was not a neutral party for reviews and took a shot at the Thanhouser Company by running an article that stated: [...] "The Selig Company announces the production of Ten Nights in a Bar Room will not be confined to one reel, but will be given all the film that it requires for proper production. This departure from the restrictive limit of 1,000 feet gives promise that the drama will have adequate treatment." [...] Bowers states that the paper [...] "was acting the role of a spoiler, for the Selig version was not released until a half year later, in June 1911, and, except for spite, there was no reason to mention it now." ...|$|E
