40|$|The optimum <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> {{has been}} studied by many researches. It is an {{important}} step of forest road network planning. The goals of this study are determining the optimum <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> in Kheiroudkenar forest of Nowshahr in Northern Iran and study of effect of kind of skidder on skidding cost and <b>road</b> <b>spacing.</b> Continues time study method was used to determine the production rate of TAF and Timberjack 450 C skidders in two districts of Kheiroudkenar forest. The production models were developed using stepwise regression method with 46 working cycles for TAF and 44 for Timberjack. The total road construction and skidding cost were calculated for different <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> for both skidders in one-way and two-way skidding. Based on minimizing the sum of the road and skidding costs, the optimum <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> was estimated as 1714 m and road density of 5. 8 m/ha for two-way skidding by Timberjack and estimated optimum <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> of TAF was 1600 m and road density of 6. 25 m/ha. For one-way skidding, the optimum <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> of Timberjack was 1143 m and road density of 8. 8 m/ha, for skidding by TAF, the optimum spacing was estimated as 1114 m and road density of 8. 97 m/ha. The existing road density of Timberjack and TAF skidding sites was 28. 16 and 17. 11 m/ha respectively which are higher than optimum density.

40|$|To {{minimize}} {{the cost of}} logging, {{it is necessary to}} optimize the road density. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine optimal <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> (ORS) in Northern Austria. The stepwise regression method was used in modelling. The production rate of tower yarder was 10. 4 m 3 /PSHo (Productive system hours) and cost of 19. 71 €. m– 3. ORS was studied by calculating road construction cost, installation cost and yarding cost per m 3 for different <b>road</b> <b>spacing.</b> The minimum total cost occurred at 39. 15 €. m– 3 and ORS would be 474 m assuming uphill and downhill yarding. The optimal road density and yarding distance are 21. 1 m. ha– 1 and 90 m, respectively. A sample logging area was used to plan different roads and, using network analysis, the best solution was found based on a modified shortest path algorithm. The network analysis results were very different from the optimal <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> results that assumed roads and logging corridors could be located anywhere in the planning area at a constant cost. Mixed integer programming was also used to get a real optimal solution...|$|R

40|$|The {{calculation}} of optimum setting dimensions and road standards simultaneously on a timber sale {{is a common}} problem in uniform terrain. Analysis usually begins by evaluating certain road standards under various road spacings and profile geometries. Linear costs, single period entry and simplified skidding patterns are often assumed to permit simpler calculations and closed form solutions. Various skidding patterns, nonlinear costs, multiple periods, and variable road standards are not considered. In this paper, the simultaneous solution of spur <b>road</b> <b>spacing,</b> collector <b>road</b> <b>spacing,</b> and choice of collector road standards for linear and nonlinear skidding functions are considered. For the linear skidding function, a multiple period formulation is made. The <b>road</b> and landing <b>spacing</b> problem is solved by (1) complete enumeration, (2) a combination of complete enumeration and the Hooke and Jeeves pattern search method, and (3) by the Hooke and Jeeves pattern search method. The Hooke and Jeeves pattern search method provided the fastest solution times with solutions {{almost as good as}} the complete enumeration. The improvements in road spacings, and cost evaluation using the more complex assumptions are compared with simpler analyses...|$|R

25|$|The {{simplest}} and oldest arrangement {{consists of}} two turnouts and a fixed diamond crossing. Because the diamond needs to be relatively coarse, say 1 in 8, the curve radius is necessarily small, leading to a speed of perhaps 25 km/h. This type of junction is common on street-running tramways, where speeds are quite low and junction must fit into the available <b>road</b> <b>space.</b> Because the points are close together, the entire junction can be controlled by the mechanical point rodding of a single signal box.|$|E

The goal {{of this paper is}} to {{determine}} optimal <b>road</b> <b>spacing</b> (ORS) of yarding operations by tower yarder in Styria to help logging planners minimize logging costs. A total of 591 working cycles were used to develop the multiple regression model using stepwise method to predict yarding time per cycle. The production and cost in whole tree uphill yarding were 6. 70 m 3 /PSH and 27. 60 Euro/m 3, respectively.

25|$|Motorization of the 1930s {{raised a}} number of concerns, {{starting}} {{with the need to}} secure a continuous fuel supply. The new formations had a significantly larger footprint on the march: the 1932 French motorized division took up 52 kilometers of <b>road</b> <b>space</b> compared to 11.5 kilometers for a horse-mounted formation, raising concerns about control and vulnerability. The Spanish Civil War and other conflicts of 1930s did not provide definite solutions and the issues remained unresolved until the onset of World War II.

25|$|In {{practice}} {{there is}} a sliding scale of green transport depending on the sustainability of the option. Green vehicles are more fuel-efficient, but only in comparison with standard vehicles, and they still contribute to traffic congestion and road crashes. Well-patronised public transport networks based on traditional diesel buses use less fuel per passenger than private vehicles, and are generally safer and use less <b>road</b> <b>space</b> than private vehicles. Green public transport vehicles including electric trains, trams and electric buses combine the advantages of green vehicles with those of sustainable transport choices. Other transport choices with very low environmental impact are cycling and other human-powered vehicles, and animal powered transport. The most common green transport choice, with the least environmental impact is walking.|$|E
25|$|In April 2016 the Traffic Management Bureau {{under the}} Ministry of Public Security {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} new green license plates to identify new energy vehicles, as opposed to the country's standard blue plates.

The objective of the special plates is to facilitate police enforcement of the preferential policies that some local authorities apply to cleaner cars to help cut emissions and ease traffic. For example, central Beijing has in place a <b>road</b> <b>space</b> rationing scheme, a driving restriction regulation that bans conventional vehicles from entering the city for one day a week, but new energy vehicles are exempted from the restriction. Beijing also introduced a vehicle quota system in 2011, awarding new car licenses through a lottery, with a ceiling of 6 million units for 2017. New energy vehicles were placed in a special category where the odds of winning a license plate are much higher than conventional autos.|$|E

500|$|In April 2012, {{one of the}} {{committees}} of the São Paulo city council approved a bill to introduce congestion pricing within the same area as the existing <b>road</b> <b>space</b> rationing (...) by the last digit of the license plate, {{which has been in}} force 1996.

The bill still needs approval by two other committees before going for a final vote at the city council. Since 1995, 11 bills have been presented in the city council to introduce congestion pricing.|$|E
500|$|Inequality issue: A {{main concern}} is the {{possibility}} of undesirable distribution repercussions because of the diversity of road users. The use of the tolled road depends on the user's level of income. [...] Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge, then this policy is likely to privilege the middle-class and rich. The users who shift to some less-preferred alternative are also worse off. The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit. <b>Road</b> <b>space</b> rationing is another strategy generally viewed as more equitable than congestion pricing. However, high-income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand (such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a job site) are relatively more impacted.|$|E
500|$|The {{real-world}} demand {{functions for}} urban road travel {{are more complex}} than the theoretical functions used in transport economics analysis. Congestion pricing was developed as a first-best solution, {{based on the assumption that}} the optimal price of <b>road</b> <b>space</b> equals the marginal cost price if all other goods in the economy are also marginal cost priced. In the real world this is not true, thus, actual implementation of congestion pricing is just a proxy or second-best solution. Based on the economic principles behind congestion pricing, the optimal congestion charge should make up for the difference between the average cost paid by the driver and the marginal cost imposed on other drivers (such as extra delay) and on society as a whole (such as air pollution). [...] The practical challenge of setting optimal link-based tolls is daunting given that neither the demand functions nor the link-specific speed-flow curves can be known precisely. Therefore, transport economists recognize that in practice setting the right price for the congestion charge becomes a trial and error experience.|$|E
40|$|In forest engineering, time {{prediction}} {{models are}} common tools for evaluating production study of different forest machineries depending on stand and terrain parameters. Usually these models are developed using multiple regression method {{based on the}} statistical data collected by different time study methods.
