25|$|The 2011 study {{established}} eight unique derived traits or autapomorphies {{in which}} Scipionyx differed from its closest relatives. The praemaxilla has five teeth. Where the parietal and the frontal bone make contact, the depression {{in which the}} supratemporal fenestra, a skull <b>roof</b> <b>opening,</b> was present, shows a sinuous ridge on the postorbital. The lower branch of the squamosal has a rectangular end. The wrist consists of just two, superimposed, bones: a radial and a lower element formed by a fusion {{of the first and}} second carpal. This last element has the shape of a lens, not a crescent; is flattened; and is fused seamlessly. The first finger is conspicuously elongated, 23% longer than the third finger. The notch in the front edge of the ilium is directed to the front and only weakly developed. The front edge of the ischium shaft has a long obturator process with a rectangular end.|$|E

It was the first retractable roof major-sports venue in the world, covering 170,000 sq. feet, constructed with nearly 3,000 tons of Pittsburgh steel and supported solely by a massive 260-foot-long cantilevered arm on the exterior. Even though it was designed and engineered as a retractable-roof dome, the operating cost and repairs to the hydraulic jacks halted all full retractions after 1995, and the roof stayed permanently closed after 2001.

60|$|It {{was long}} before the child closed the window, and {{approached}} her bed. Again something of the same sensation as before--an involuntary chill--a momentary feeling akin to fear--but vanishing directly, and leaving no alarm behind. Again, too, dreams of the little scholar; of the <b>roof</b> <b>opening,</b> and a column of bright faces, rising far away into the sky, as she had seen in some old scriptural picture once, and looking down on her, asleep. It was a sweet and happy dream. The quiet spot, outside, seemed to remain the same, saving that there was music in the air, and a sound of angels' wings. After a time the sisters came there, hand in hand, and stood among the graves. And then the dream grew dim, and faded.|$|E

40|$|Value Engineering (VE) was {{developed}} during World War II {{as a method}} to find alternative methods and materials for processes and products that were limited and challenged by rationing. Since its creation, {{the use of the}} VE process has extended to the construction industry as a way to maximize the value of a project. This research is being conducted to aid future VE brainstorming efforts by studying past VE studies and looking for trends. 14 VE studies from four construction companies were obtained. One significant finding was that electric, HVAC, plumbing and wall finishes are the best categories to propose VE in because they had a large sample size (20 or more VE items), and the percent of VE items approved in these categories was around or above 70 %. This success rate was consistent when looking at the quantity of approved VE items and at the dollar value of the items. The categories that are not recommended for VE are elevators, fire protection, foundations, <b>roof</b> <b>openings,</b> canopies, stair construction, fixed furnishings, general and specialties. One reason for this conclusion is that the monetary value of these categories is less significant. Also, for elevators, fire protection, foundations, canopies, <b>roof</b> <b>openings,</b> canopies and stair construction, they are often specially engineered systems and specialized so there is little that is able to be changed. Fixed furnishings, general and specialties cover so many different topics that there is little consistency among VE items...|$|R

5|$|Wind {{causes the}} {{generation}} of sound. The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause {{a low level of}} environmental noise. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object. Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions. Examples of these parts are balconies, ventilation <b>openings,</b> <b>roof</b> <b>openings</b> or cables.|$|R

All four shared the same basic {{bodyshell}} but, whereas the De-Luxe models had a sliding sunroof, the Popular version had a fixed panel over the <b>roof</b> <b>opening.</b> In the ensuing years, many cars had the sliding roof removed but the presence of the drainage channels front and rear indicates the De-Luxe origins. Other features of the De-Luxe model were leather seats, chrome bumpers and a rear luggage rack.|$|E
50|$|The car was {{presented}} as an all-new design. It shared a six-light (three windows on each side) profile with its predecessor, but was more streamlined. Standard fittings included a sliding <b>roof,</b> <b>opening</b> windscreen and leather upholstery. The bonnet (hood) was now one piece and hinged at the rear, rather than opening at the sides. The body was 3 in longer than the earlier car, despite having a wheelbase that was (initially) 5.5 in shorter. It was also 0.5 in wider. A conventional chassis frame was retained, and the brakes were mechanical, with operation by a system of rods. Rigid beam axles were retained front and rear with conventional leaf springs.|$|E

5000|$|The targa style <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> {{became popular}} in the 1960s and 1970s, when there were fears that the Department of Transportation (DOT) in the United States would ban convertibles, due to {{concerns}} over the safety of occupants when a car overturns. As a result, manufacturers adopted Targa tops or T-tops. As Porsche helped to popularise this body style, they took out a trademark for the Targa name and manufacturers sought for alternative names for their removable tops. Porsche got the name [...] "Targa" [...] from the Targa Florio, the famous road race in Sicily where Porsche was very successful. Targa means [...] "plate" [...] in Italian.|$|E

50|$|The {{committee}} examined various projects, {{including a}} large indoor stadium at Exhibition Place with an air-supported dome, similar to BC Place in Vancouver.

Some of the proposed sites included Exhibition Place, Downsview Airport, and York University. The final site was located {{at the base of}} the CN Tower not far from Union Station, a major railway and transit hub. The Railway Lands were a major Canadian National Railway rail switching yard encompassing the CNR Spadina Roundhouse (the desolate downtown lands were part of a master plan for revitalizing the area, which includes CityPlace). Ultimately, the Robbie/Allen concept won because it provided the largest <b>roof</b> <b>opening</b> of all the finalists, and it was the most technically sound.|$|E
