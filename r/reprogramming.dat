5|$|The {{game was}} {{released}} on September 15, 2015 for Microsoft Windows and OS X, and on July 17, 2016 for Linux. Fox has expressed interest in releasing Undertale on other platforms, but is unable to port it to Nintendo platforms without <b>reprogramming</b> the game due to the engine's lack {{of support for the}} platforms. A patch was released in January 2016, fixing bugs and altering the appearance of blue attacks to help colorblind players see them better. Sony Interactive Entertainment announced during E3 2017 that Undertale would get a release for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita, a Japanese localization, and a retail version published by Fangamer. These versions were released on August 15, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for <b>reprogramming</b> {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost {{a decade and a half}} after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E

40|$|Somatic cells such as fibroblasts, <b>reprogrammed</b> to induced {{pluripotent}} stem cells, {{can be used}} {{to generate}} neural stem/progenitor cells or neuroblasts for transplantation. In this review, we summarize recent studies demonstrating that when grafted intracerebrally in animal models of stroke, <b>reprogrammed</b> neurons improve function, probably by several different mechanisms, e. g., trophic actions, modulation of inflammation, promotion of angiogenesis, cellular and synaptic plasticity, and neuroprotection. In our own work, we have shown that human skin-derived <b>reprogrammed</b> neurons, fated to cortical progeny, integrate in stroke-injured neuronal network and form functional afferent synapses with host neurons, responding to peripheral sensory stimulation. However, whether neuronal replacement plays a role for the improvement of sensory, motor, and cognitive deficits after transplantation of <b>reprogrammed</b> neurons is still unclear. We conclude that further preclinical studies are needed to understand the therapeutic potential of grafted <b>reprogrammed</b> neurons and to define a road map for their clinical translation in stroke...|$|R
5|$|The final boss fight {{takes place}} at the Altar Emerald temple. If the player defeats Eggman there without having all seven Chaos Emeralds, Eggman and Gemerl escape and fall {{off the edge of the}} temple. Peace is {{restored}} to the world, and Omochao snaps a picture of the five heroes. However, the game alerts the player that the Emeralds must still be collected for the true ending. If the player defeats Eggman at the temple with all the Chaos Emeralds, Gemerl stops running away with Eggman and attacks Sonic, causing the Emeralds to scatter. Gemerl uses them to take on a giant, orb-shaped form, but Sonic also uses their power to attain his Super Sonic form. With Eggman's help, Super Sonic destroys Gemerl. Tails later finds Gemerl's broken body on a beach, repairing and <b>reprogramming</b> it. The game ends as Cream plays with the now non-aggressive Gemerl at her mother Vanilla's house.|$|E
5|$|Turning Urine Samples into Brain Cells: This new {{technique}} of <b>reprogramming</b> ordinary cells present in urine into immature brain cells that can form multiple types of functioning neurons and glial cells {{was developed by}} Chinese researchers in China, and {{was published in the}} scientific journal Nature Methods in December 2012. Instead of using retrovirus, they used vectors which the researchers say is a breakthrough This does not involve embryonic stem cells which come with serious drawbacks when transplanted, such as the risk of developing tumours. This technique makes the procedure of generating Induced pluripotent stem cells far easier and non-invasive, as the cells can be obtained from a urine sample instead of a blood sample or biopsy. This research proves human excreta could be a powerful source of cells to study disease, bypassing some of the problems of using stem cells, and could be useful for research studying the cellular mechanisms of neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's and for testing the effects of new drugs that are being developed to treat them.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the main}} {{strategies}} for avoiding problems (1) and (2) has been to use minute compounds that can mimic the effects of transcription factors. These molecule compounds can compensate for a <b>reprogramming</b> factor that does not effectively target the genome or fails at <b>reprogramming</b> for another reason; thus they raise <b>reprogramming</b> efficiency. They also avoid the problem of genomic integration, which in some cases contributes to tumor genesis.|$|E

25|$|Imprinting {{may cause}} {{problems}} in cloning, with clones having DNA {{that is not}} methylated in the correct positions. It is possible that {{this is due to}} a lack of time for <b>reprogramming</b> to be completely achieved. When a nucleus is added to an egg during somatic cell nuclear transfer, the egg starts dividing in minutes, as compared to the days or months it takes for <b>reprogramming</b> during embryonic development. If time is the responsible factor, it may be possible to delay cell division in clones, giving time for proper <b>reprogramming</b> to occur.|$|E

25|$|Tumorigenicity: Depending on {{the methods}} used, <b>reprogramming</b> of adult cells to obtain iPSCs may pose {{significant}} risks that could limit {{their use in}} humans. For example, if viruses are used to genomically alter the cells, the expression of oncogenes (cancer-causing genes) may potentially be triggered. In February 2008, scientists announced {{the discovery of a}} technique that could remove oncogenes after the induction of pluripotency, thereby increasing the potential use of iPS cells in human diseases. In another study, Yamanaka reported that one can create iPSCs without the oncogene c-Myc. The process took longer and was not as efficient, but the resulting chimeras didn't develop cancer. Inactivation or deletion of the tumor suppressor p53, which is a key regulator of cancer, significantly increases <b>reprogramming</b> efficiency. Thus {{there seems to be a}} tradeoff between <b>reprogramming</b> efficiency and tumor generation.|$|E

40|$|SummaryThe {{application}} of cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine is gaining recognition. Here, {{we show that}} human bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), also known as bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal cells, can be <b>reprogrammed</b> into renal proximal tubular-like epithelial cells using cell-free extracts. Streptolysin-O-permeabilized BMSCs exposed to HK 2 -cell extracts underwent morphological changes—formation of “domes” and tubule-like structures—and acquired epithelial functional properties such as transepithelial-resistance, albumin-binding, and uptake and specific markers E-cadherin and aquaporin- 1. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the presence of brush border microvilli and tight intercellular contacts. RNA sequencing showed tubular epithelial transcript abundance and revealed the upregulation of components of the EGFR pathway. <b>Reprogrammed</b> BMSCs integrated into self-forming kidney tissue and formed tubular structures. <b>Reprogrammed</b> BMSCs infused in immunodeficient mice with cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury engrafted into proximal tubuli, reduced renal injury and improved function. Thus, <b>reprogrammed</b> BMSCs are a promising cell resource for future cell therapy...|$|R

25|$|Depending on {{the method}} used, <b>reprogramming</b> of adult cells into iPSCs for {{implantation}} could have severe limitations in humans. If a virus {{is used as}} a <b>reprogramming</b> factor for the cell, cancer-causing genes called oncogenes may be activated. These cells would appear as rapidly dividing cancer cells that do not respond to the body's natural cell signaling process. However, in 2008 scientists discovered a technique that could remove the presence of these oncogenes after pluripotency induction, thereby increasing the potential use of iPSC in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Reprogramming</b> {{of human}} cells to iPSCs was {{reported}} in November 2007 by two independent research groups: Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University, Japan, who pioneered the original iPSC method, and James Thomson of University of Wisconsin-Madison {{who was the first}} to derive human embryonic stem cells. With the same principle used in mouse <b>reprogramming,</b> Yamanaka's group successfully transformed human fibroblasts into iPSCs with the same four pivotal genes, OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and C-MYC, using a retroviral system, while Thomson and colleagues used a different set of factors, OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28, using a lentiviral system.|$|E
25|$|Interspecies nuclear {{transfer}} provides {{evidence of the}} universality of the triggering mechanism of the cell nucleus <b>reprogramming.</b> For example, Gupta et al., explored the possibility of producing transgenic cloned embryos by interspecies somatic cell {{nuclear transfer}} (iSCNT) of cattle, mice, and chicken donor cells into enucleated pig oocytes. Moreover, NCSU23 medium, which was designed for in vitro culture of pig embryos, was able to support the in vitro development of cattle, mice, and chicken iSCNT embryos up to the blastocyst stage. Furthermore, ovine oocyte cytoplast {{may be used for}} remodeling and <b>reprogramming</b> of human somatic cells back to the embryonic stage.|$|E

25|$|The task of {{producing}} iPS cells {{continues to be}} challenging due to the six problems mentioned above. A key tradeoff to overcome is that between efficiency and genomic integration. Most methods that do not rely on the integration of transgenes are inefficient, while those that do rely on the integration of transgenes face the problems of incomplete <b>reprogramming</b> and tumor genesis, although {{a vast number of}} techniques and methods have been attempted. Another large set of strategies is to perform a proteomic characterization of iPS cells. Further studies and new strategies should generate optimal solutions to the five main challenges. One approach might attempt to combine the positive attributes of these strategies into an ultimately effective technique for <b>reprogramming</b> cells to iPS cells.|$|E

25|$|NF-κB {{activates}} {{the expression}} of numerous genes {{that are involved in}} the transition between inflammation and regeneration, which encode cytokines, adhesion factors, and other molecules that can change cell fate. This <b>reprogramming</b> of cellular phenotypes normally allows the development of a fully functional intact tissue. NF-κB activity is tightly controlled by multiple proteins, which collectively ensure that only discrete clusters of genes are induced by NF-κB in a given cell and at a given time. This tight regulation of signal exchange between cells, protects the tissue from excessive inflammation, and ensures that different cell types would gradually acquire complementary functions, and specific positions. Failure of this mutual regulation between genetic <b>reprogramming</b> and cell interactions allows cancer cells to give rise to metastasis. Cancer cells respond aberrantly to cytokines, and activate signal cascades that can protect them from the immune system.|$|E
