COMMERCIAL CATCHES It has been recognised that the recent catches of grenadiers by EU-Portugal and EU-Spain in Subarea 3, previously reported to NAFO as roundnose grenadiers, correspond to <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> (Alpoim et al., 1994; Power and Parsons, 1998; Junquera, 1998). The reason for this misclassification could be mainly because roundnose grenadier was the only name that appears in the statistical data reporting forms. The misreporting has not yet been resolved in the official statistics before 1996, but the species are reported correctly since 1997. Beginning in 1990, more <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> has been caught than roundnose <b>grenadier</b> (Atkinson, 1995). <b>Roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> is taken as by-catch in the Greenland halibut fishery in the Regulatory Area mainly in Div. 3 LMN.

The biomass estimated for the beginning of 2005 was around 70. 000 tonnes, the highest in the time series. Fishing mortality has declined since 1999 and showed the lowest value in the time series in 2005. Over the last few years, there have been two years with very good recruitment at age 3, which may increase the exploitable biomass in the future. The assessment results showed that the current <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> Subarea 2 and 3 stock status is healthy. While the analysis indicated that there was a clear retrospective pattern in the model estimates (i. e., fishing mortality being underestimated and total biomass overestimated), the sensitivity analysis showed that the results were robust to the model set up. Although the short time series available, in addition to the wide age composition of this species, the low fishing mortality level estimate by XSA and the lack of convergence in the retrospective analyses, the results showed that the XSA model adequately fitted the data and that the XSA estimated trends are similar to those observed by research surveys.

No evidence of significant structure was found throughout the North Atlantic, with both sets of molecular markers yielding the same results of overall homogeneity. We posit two non-mutually exclusive scenarios that can explain such outcome: i) substantial high gene flow among locations, possibly maintained by larval stages, ii) very large effective size of post-glacially expanded populations.

Different {{assessment}} methods have been applied based on the available data: XSA, ASPIC and a qualitative assessment based on survey and fishery information. The fit of the data to the XSA and ASPIC has been very poor mainly due to lack of contrast and conflicting information from the surveys data. Therefore the results are not considered representative of the stock situation. There are not available surveys indices covering the total distribution, in depth and area, of this stock. Biomass indices from the surveys with depth coverage till 1400 meters are considered as the best survey information available to monitor trends in resource status because they cover the depth distribution of <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> fairly well. Surveys biomass indices present a general increasing trend in the period 1995 - 2004. In the period 2005 - 2012 all available indices show a clear downward trend except the Canadian Fall (2 J+ 3 K) index. In the most recent period (2013 - 2015) the information of the different indices is contradictory, the Canadian 2 J 3 K and the EU 3 L show an increase while EU-FC and EU 3 NO continue to decline.

40|$|This study, {{based on}} field and {{laboratory}} observations, investigated {{the role of}} parasites {{as the cause of}} disease outbreaks and mass mortality in wild and cultured fish in Newfoundland over three decades. One ciliated protozoan, Trichodina jadranica (Ciliophora), and Loma branchialis (Microspora) were responsible for mass mortality of cultured fry and fingerling Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) while a myxozoan, Tetracapsuloides bryosalmonae, and plerocercoids of a cestode, Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, caused a die-off of hatchery-reared Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus) and rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) respectively after transfer to outdoor cages. A hematophagous copepod, Lernaeocera branchialis, was associated with mortality of wild Atlantic cod both in the laboratory and possibly in the field. One additional parasite, a coccidian, Goussia caseosa, caused lesions in the swim bladder of the <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier,</b> Macrourus berglax, a deep-sea fish. It is surmised that parasites have {{played a major role in}} mortality of both wild and cultured fish in New-foundland. Recommendations are made to prevent potential die-offs in cultured fish...|$|R
40|$|According {{the autumn}} Canadian survey (2 J+ 3 K) and the Spanish 3 NO survey, the <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> total biomass indices would {{indicate}} a general increasing trend from 1995 onwards. The catch / biomass (C/B) indexes obtained using the Canadian autumn survey and the Spanish 3 NO biomass index {{in the period}} 1995 - 2004 show a clear decrease trend from 1995 to 2004, due to an increasing trend in the survey biomass and a decreased of catches. The Z estimate from the catch curve based upon commercial catch at age data (1992 - 2004) was 0. 355 for ages 8 to 20, the value estimate from the catch curve of the UE Flemish Cap survey (1994 - 2004) was 0. 511 for the same ages and 0. 394 for the catch curve of the Spanish 3 NO survey data (1997 - 2004). The Separable VPA (Pope and Shepherd, 1982) stock assessment model was fitted to the stock data, years 1993 to 2004 and ages 3 to 20, for the <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> Subarea 2 and 3. The model seems to fit adequately the data. The results of the Separable VPA were used to start a traditional VPA. The mean fishing mortality for ages 8 to 20 in the period 1993 - 2004 was 0. 259 and is similar than those calculated by the catch curves with the catch matrix data (0. 255) and with the Spanish 3 NO survey data (0. 294) for the same ages. Moreover the trend of F bar (8 - 14) of the VPA {{is similar to the}} catch/survey biomass ratio for the Canadian Autumn survey (2 J 3 K) and the Spanish 3 NO survey. However the VPA biomass trend is total different from the biomass trend of the Canadian Autumn (2 J 3 K) and Spanish 3 NO surveys, in the last years the biomass of the surveys show a great increase and the VPA biomass is stable at the lowest levels of the series. Recruits at age 3 have the same problem, survey show in 2004 the biggest recruitment of the series while VPA show for 2004 a normal recruitment...|$|R
40|$|A {{collection}} of 4770 histological slides collected in NAFO divisions 3 LMN in a depth range from 200 to 1500 m and covering a time period between 2001 and 2015, has been reviewed {{to obtain information}} on reproductive biology of Macrourus berglax. Especial {{attention has been paid}} in atresia because its potential impact on stock productivity. Spatial and temporal variability of size and age at maturity of female <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> was analyzed in NAFO divisions 3 LMN based on microscopic maturity staging and individual age readings. Spawning capable females are homogeneously distributed nearly year-round, but in scarce numbers what prevent to define a spawning season. This statement united to the high levels of atresia could indicate a reproductive migration. We observed a clear decrease in length at first maturity (L 50) of females from 27. 8 cm in the period 2005 - 2011 to 25. 6 cm in the last four years. The age at first maturity, A 50, varied between 13. 1 and 15 years, and there is not an evident trend of change over the years. Postprint 0, 000...|$|R

40|$|The {{specific}} {{composition of}} by-catch was studied: 17 species, their presence calculated by depth strata, month and Division, and variations in monthly yield by {{division in the}} Spanish Greenland halibut fishery, developed in the NAFO regulated area for the period 1991 - 1994. Two groups of species were identified depending {{on the importance of}} their presence in catches: the more and less frequent species. The more frequent species were considered those with a value of above 5 kg/h annual yield, i. e. Skate, Roundnose <b>grenadier</b> and <b>Roughhead</b> <b>grenadier,</b> American plaice, Witch flounder and Redfish. Analyzing the data on a monthly basis, however, reveals the presence of higher values of yield than other species. Some species show a stational pattern, such as Grenadiers, Skate and American plaice, particularly in Division 3 N. An other hand, other species have increased yields in recent years. In this fishery, the characteristic species of the demersal fisheries (Skate, American plaice) showed a wider bathymetric distribution than that considered typical in each case. The transfer of effort southwards (Divs. 3 NO) in recent years, mainly in the case of small vessels, has meant variation in the composition and relative abundance of by-catch in this fleet...|$|R
50|$|The <b>roughhead</b> <b>grenadier</b> {{can reach}} {{a length of}} one metre (yard). The head {{occupies}} about {{one quarter of the}} total length of the fish and it has a slender body and long tapering tail. There are some bony spiny scutes or scales on the upper side of the head but the lower side is scaleless. The snout is pointed and the small mouth is set far back on the lower side of the head with a short barbel underneath. There are 3 to 5 rows of sharp teeth in the upper jaw and 1 or 2 rows in the lower jaw. The eye is large and bulbous, giving the fish its alternative name of onion-eye grenadier. There are two dorsal fins, the front one having 11 to 13 finrays and the hind one running along the back to the tip of the tail. The anal fin is similarly long and narrow and there is no tailfin. The body is covered in large ridged, spiny scales. The general body colour is grey, darker underneath, with dark fins and dark edges to some of the scales.|$|R
