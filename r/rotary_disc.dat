2500|$|The Journal of Archaeological Science {{published}} a detailed {{study by the}} British Museum and the Smithsonian in May 2008. Using electron microscopy and X-ray crystallography, a team of British and American researchers found that the British Museum skull was worked with a harsh abrasive substance such as corundum or diamond, and shaped using a <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> tool made from some suitable metal. The Smithsonian specimen had been worked with a different abrasive, namely the silicon-carbon compound carborundum (Silicon carbide) which is a synthetic substance manufactured using modern industrial techniques. Since the synthesis of carborundum dates only to the 1890s and its wider availability to the 20th century, the researchers concluded [...] "he suggestion {{is that it was}} made in the 1950s or later".|$|E

40|$|Commonly, biocellulose was {{harvested}} from trees and cotton. However, Acetobacter xylinum, a gram-negative bacteria was discovered {{as being the}} microorganism capable of producing biocellulose by fermentation. This first generation of biocellulose is widely known as Nata whereby in Malaysia, this biocellulose was only produced as a dessert by food industries. However, there are some excellent properties of biocellulose make it able {{to be used in}} many fields. The modified biocellulose used for application other than dessert is defined as second generation biocellulose. This work aims to transfer the technology of a modified method for producing the second generation of biocellulose from bacteria. In this program, the designed <b>Rotary</b> <b>Discs</b> Reactor was being introduced to the company as a new method for biocellulose production. Efforts will be made {{with the help of the}} company to optimize and upscale the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Discs</b> Reactor for high production yield of biocellulose. This includes support for the expertise in fabricating, instrumentation, space and operational aspects. The biocellulose produced were further processed into a film for heavy metal removal in wastewater and powder as an additive in cement materials. This cooperation leads to a profitable outcome for the company by 30 % improvement in the production rate of biocellulose compared to conventional static fermentation (tray methods) and opens for new applications of biocellulose. On the other hand, the company, university, and students gain benefits from sharing knowledge, facilities, intellectual properties, expertise, increase networking and at the same time enhance the graduate attributes for a future working environment...|$|R

40|$|Acetobacter xylinum strains {{are known}} as {{efficient}} producers of cellulose. A. xylinum is an obligate aerobic bacterium that has an oxygen-based metabolism. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in a <b>rotary</b> <b>discs</b> reactor (RDR) {{is one of the}} most important factors that need to be observed during the cellulose synthesis by these bacteria. In this study, the effects of different discs rotation speed (5, 7, 9 and 12 rpm) and fermentation period (3, 4, 5 and 6 days) on the DO concentration and production of bacterial cellulose in a 10 -L RDR were examined. The highest yield was obtained at 7 rpm with a total dried weight of 28. 3 g for 4 days fermentation. The results showed that the DO concentration in the 10 -L RDR increased in the range of 13 to 17 % with increasing of discs rotation speed from 7 to 12 rpm. However, fermentation with high discs rotation speed at 12 rpm reduced the bacterial cellulose production. Analysis of data using Statistica 8. 0 showed a high coefficient of determination value (R 2 = 0. 92). In conclusion, discs rotation speed gave more significant effect on the DO concentration and production of bacterial cellulose in 10 -L RDR compared to fermentation period. This was further combined with synergistic effect from sufficient consumption of oxygen for the enhanced production of bacterial cellulose and providing the controlled environment for encouraging bacterial growth throughout the fermentation process...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s and 1980s {{improved}} application {{technologies such}} as controlled droplet application (CDA) received extensive research interest, but commercial uptake has been disappointing. By controlling droplet size, ultra-low volume (ULV) or very low volume (VLV) application rates of pesticidal mixtures can achieve similar (or sometimes better) biological results by improved timing and dose-transfer to the biological target (i.e. pest). No atomizer has been developed able to produce uniform (monodisperse) droplets, but <b>rotary</b> (spinning <b>disc</b> and cage) atomizers usually produce a more uniform droplet size spectrum than conventional hydraulic nozzles (see: CDA & ULV application equipment). Other efficient application techniques include: banding, baiting, specific granule placement, seed treatments and weed wiping.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. <b>Rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|E
50|$|Cinematography uses a <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> shutter {{in movie}} cameras, a {{continuously}} spinning disc which conceals the image with a reflex mirror during the intermittent motion between frame exposure.

50|$|In movie projection, {{the shutter}} admits {{light from the}} lamphouse to {{illuminate}} the film across to the projection screen. To avoid flicker, a double-bladed <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> shutter admits light two times per frame of film. There are also some models which are triple-bladed, and thus admit light three times per frame (see Persistence of vision).|$|E

40|$|A {{system of}} light harvesting, sensing and {{regulating}} was designed {{based on the}} photo-thermal and Seebeck effect of flexible CuO nanostructures. Cu@CuO meshes were prepared via self-oxidation of Cu mesh and utilized as the photo-thermal material. Upon irradiation by visible light, {{the temperature of the}} Cu@CuO mesh dramatically increases. The temperature difference between the irradiated and non-irradiated parts of the Cu@CuO mesh produced a measurable voltage output due to the Seebeck effect. The generated voltage was then converted into a digital signal to control a <b>rotary</b> neutral-density <b>disc</b> to filter the received light.

40|$|Polypropylene (PP) nanofibres {{have been}} electrospun from molten PP using a needleless melt-electrospinning setup {{containing}} a <b>rotary</b> metal <b>disc</b> spinneret. The {{influence of the}} disc spinneret (e. g., disc material and diameter), operating parameters (e. g., applied voltage, spinning distance), and a cationic surfactant on the fibre formation and average fibre diameter were examined. It was shown that the metal material used for making the disc spinneret {{had a significant effect}} on the fibre formation. Although the applied voltage had little effect on the fibre diameter, the spinning distance affected the fibre diameter considerably, with shorter spinning distance resulting in finer fibres. When a small amount of cationic surfactant (dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide) was added to the PP melt for melt-electrospinning, the fibre diameter was reduced considerably. The finest fibres produced from this system were 400 ± 290 [*]nm. This novel melt-electrospinning setup may provide a continuous and efficient method to produce PP nanofibres...|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a unique {{straight}} twin, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil-injected, dual <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve. The engine's ignition air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was pulled through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head then downward into the two internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors. The A1 had two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and inline with the crankshaft. The carburetors were enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, was the disc cover. The <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve was housed inboard of that cover. The A1 Samurai motor was lubricated by the Superlube system, with 2-stroke oil directly injected in the intake tract.Previously equipped with points, the ignition system was equipped in 1969 with a Capacitor discharge ignition including thyristor-based switching system then increased the voltage to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts reducing the unburned fuel mixture within the cylinders.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{numerical}} {{estimation of}} frictional torques {{is carried out}} of a <b>rotary</b> elastic <b>disc</b> on a hard and rough surface under different rotating conditions. A one dimensional spring- mass rotary system is numerically solved under the quasistatic condition with the rate and state dependent friction model. It is established that torque of frictional strength as well as torque of steady dynamic stress increases with radius and found to be maximum at {{the periphery of the}} disc. Torque corresponding to frictional strength estimated using the analytical solution matches closely with the simulation only in the case of high stiffness of the connecting spring. In steady relaxation simulation, a steadily rotating disc is suddenly stopped and relaxational angular velocity and corresponding frictional torque decreases with both steady angular velocity and stiffness of the connecting spring in the velocity strengthening regime. In velocity weakening regime, in contrast, torque of relaxation stress deceases but relaxation velocity increases. The reason for the contradiction is explained.
