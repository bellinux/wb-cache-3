5|$|The LHQ Medical <b>Research</b> <b>Unit</b> used human test subjects, all volunteers {{drawn from}} the Australian Army, {{including}} a small but notable group of 'Dunera Boys' (Jewish refugees) from the 8th Employment Company. The volunteers were infected with strains of malaria from infected mosquitoes, or from the blood of other test subjects, which was then treated with various drugs. The volunteers were rewarded with three weeks' leave and a certificate of appreciation signed by General Blamey. The LHQ Medical <b>Research</b> <b>Unit</b> researched quinine, sulphonamides, atebrin, plasmoquine, and paludrine.|$|E

50|$|Academic <b>research</b> <b>units</b> {{are made}} up of academia from many institutions. The most {{commonly}} found participants in these units are students and professors, however many firms with a coordinated market economy send their employees to these <b>research</b> <b>units.</b> These units are often publicly funded through the government, although they may be privately funded as well, and tend to be both politically and ideologically impartial. Academic <b>research</b> <b>units</b> are most common in liberal market economies with a decentralized government and open market. Prior to WWII, many of these <b>research</b> <b>units</b> were privately funded through philanthropic organizations, but following WWII, many governments began providing funding for academic <b>research</b> <b>units</b> by contracting out for policy research.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the highly {{centralized}} state, many of the knowledge regimes throughout France emerge from state-led <b>research</b> <b>units,</b> as individuals are given very few incentives or means to create or pursue their own <b>research</b> <b>units.</b> Other knowledge regimes emerge from scholarly <b>research</b> <b>units</b> that are funded through the central government.|$|R
5|$|Fairley was {{acutely aware}} that much {{remained}} unknown about malaria. In particular, {{he was interested in}} the possibility that sulphaguanidine (or a related sulphonamide) might be a causal prophylactic against malaria, as they could be manufactured in Australia, unlike atebrin and plasmoquine. Fairley decided to establish a unit in Cairns to investigate malaria. The LHQ Medical <b>Research</b> <b>Unit</b> commenced work in June 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Raffles Museum of Biodiversity Research, {{a natural}} history <b>research</b> <b>unit</b> of the National University of Singapore, {{assisted}} with {{the analysis of}} marine artefacts and corals that were uncovered at the site, and some 36 bags of samples have been deposited with the museum for further analysis. A Preliminary Site Report (dated 7 May 2006) was later compiled and submitted to the relevant authorities which outlined the research process, preliminary findings, variety of volunteers, {{and a list of}} the archaeology research team involved.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} the Brazilian <b>research</b> <b>unit</b> of the Fundação Getúlio Vargas {{regarding}} the effects of biofuels on grain prices. concluded that the major driver behind the 2007–2008 rise in food prices was speculative activity on futures markets under conditions of increased demand in a market with low grain stocks. The study also concluded that expansion of biofuel production was not a relevant factor and also {{that there is no}} correlation between Brazilian sugarcane cultivated area and average grain prices, as on the contrary, the spread of sugarcane was accompanied by rapid growth of grain crops in the country.|$|E

5|$|Fairley {{returned}} to the Australian Army during the Second World War as Director of Medicine. He {{played an important role}} in the planning for the Battle of Greece, convincing the British Commander-in-Chief, General Sir Archibald Wavell to alter his campaign plan to reduce the danger from malaria. In the South West Pacific Area, Fairley became responsible for co-ordinating the activities of all allied forces in the fight against malaria and other tropical diseases. Fairley again sounded the alarm on the dangers of malaria, persuading authorities in the United States and United Kingdom to greatly step up production of anti-malarial drugs. Through the activities of the LHQ Medical <b>Research</b> <b>Unit,</b> he fast-tracked research into new drugs. Fairley convinced the Army of the efficacy of the new drug atebrin, and persuaded commanders to adopt a tough approach to administering the drug to the troops.|$|E
5|$|Similarly 'marked' {{armed guards}} arrive {{from the plant}} and take Dillon away. Whilst being taken Dillon threateningly tells Quatermass not to follow. After the guards' {{departure}} Quatermass speaks with a tramp, who explains that {{there used to be}} a small government <b>research</b> <b>unit</b> consisting of a few huts by Winnerden Flats, and that a year ago they expanded and bulldozed the village, and built the plant and a prefab town for the construction workers. At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|Using {{draconian}} drills {{that required}} officers to place atebrin tablets in their men's mouths, the army attempted {{to reduce the}} incidence of malaria to zero. For the most part they were successful but in the Aitape-Wewak campaign the 6th Division suffered an epidemic of malaria despite its best efforts. Fairley was urgently recalled from a tour of South East Asia Command and given orders by General Blamey to personally proceed to Wewak and investigate the situation. A special section was formed from the LHQ Medical <b>Research</b> <b>Unit</b> to assist the 6th Division and certain relapsing personnel were evacuated to Cairns. The epidemic was ultimately brought under control by doubling the dosage of atebrin. Fairley was forced to confront the fact—confirmed by research at Cairns—that an atebrin resistant strain of malaria had arisen. The ability of malaria to develop resistant strains would have profound implications in the post-war world.|$|E
50|$|Advocacy <b>research</b> <b>units</b> {{are created}} by {{individuals}} who are independently motivated through their own values and morals. These <b>research</b> <b>units</b> are privately funded through organizations that directly correlate to the topic or issue being addressed through the <b>unit.</b> These <b>research</b> <b>units</b> are both politically and ideologically partisan in nature, and are more focused on discrediting research {{that has already been}} done by using the media to persuade politicians to alter certain policies. Advocacy <b>research</b> <b>units</b> are most common in political economies with decentralized states and open markets, as politicians are less likely to conform to political party standards and will seek advice through external resources.|$|R
50|$|Party <b>research</b> <b>units</b> are {{independently}} funded <b>research</b> <b>units</b> {{on behalf}} of a specific political party.

Political leaders will use the <b>research</b> from these <b>units</b> to pursue designated policy goals that will generate as much public approval and support as possible. These <b>research</b> <b>units</b> are most common in economies that operate through highly decentralized governments with several different political parties running for office during an election.|$|R

He worked {{for the next two}} years at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot. He said later that he could not continue to live in Israel because the same men who had, in his view, betrayed the Jewish community in Hungary were now in positions of power there. In 1960 he moved instead to England, where he worked for two years in the Neuropsychiatric <b>Research</b> <b>Unit</b> in Carshalton, Surrey, and seven years for the Medical Research Council.

5|$|McCall {{stayed on}} {{for one more}} season before he was {{released}} by manager Nicky Law in May 2002, shortly before the club went into administration {{for the first time}} after finishing 15th in Division One. His playing career at Bradford City had looked uncertain in December 2001 before Law arrived, when previous manager Jim Jefferies had left McCall out of the side in a 3–1 defeat at Manchester City following a training ground dispute. However, it was Jefferies who lost out in the dispute when he resigned his post a week later after summit talks with chairman Geoffrey Richmond. In April 2002, McCall's testimonial match against Rangers attracted a crowd of more than 21,000 to Valley Parade. McCall gave part of the proceeds from his testimonial to the Bradford burns <b>research</b> <b>unit,</b> which was set up following the 1985 fire. Two years after his benefit match, McCall played one more time in City colours in a Save Our City appeal match organised by Bradford's evening newspaper, the Telegraph & Argus, to raise funds for the club, who were now in administration for a second time.|$|E
