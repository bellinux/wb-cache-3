5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature,</b> and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a geographical area, it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E

The average July maximum of 23.2c(73.7f) is the third highest for a major settlement in the country, behind London and Colchester, illustrating the relative warmth of the area during the summer part of the year.The record maximum is 35.2c(95.4f), set during August 2003. Typically 24.9 days of the year will record a maximum temperature of 25.1c (77.2f) or above, and the warmest day of the year should reach 30.0c(86.0f), on average.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{research}} showed capsaicin {{to evoke}} a long-onset current {{in comparison to}} other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor. Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel {{has been shown to}} be a member of the superfamily of TRP ion channels, and as such is now referred to as [...] There are a number of different TRP ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a chemical burn, or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure. [...] The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of C fibers [...] culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.|$|E

2500|$|Thermal {{perturbations}} {{are by far}} {{the most}} common type of external stimulus used to induce SCO. There are many examples of complexes that exhibit SCO with the aid of thermal variation. One such example was reported in 2007 by Dunbar et al. in which a pentanuclear cluster exhibits the SCO phenomenon. Figure 11 shows the 32 trigonal bipyramid (TBP), with the FeII centers in the equatorial positions and Figure 12 shows a 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum at 300 K for the cluster. Dunbar et al. had found that increasing the temperature causes a major change in the cluster’s electronic structure. The amount of HS FeII present in any sample within the range of 4.2 K to 50 K does not change and remains under 20%, but at room temperature about two-thirds of the FeII ions in the sample of water-containing crystals exhibit a HS state, as shown by the absorption band at 2.1mm/s, while the other third of the ions remain in the LS state. This shows that either every TBP cluster converts from a [...] at 4.2 K to [...] at room temperature or that two-thirds of the clusters change from [...] to [...] over the same <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature.</b> In addition to the crystals containing water, Dunbar et al. studied the effect of interstitial solvent on SCO by studying acetonitrile-containing crystals as well. This study revealed a similar phenomenon but over a lower temperature range, data that support the conclusion that weak effects such as crystal packing environments can affect SCO as well.|$|E
60|$|A {{remarkable}} {{uniformity of}} temperature prevails {{throughout the year}} at Dorjiling, there being only 22 degrees difference between the mean temperatures of the hottest and coldest months; whilst in London, with a lower mean temperature, the equivalent difference is 27 degrees. At 11,000 feet this difference is {{equal to that of}} London. In more elevated regions, it is still greater, the climate becoming excessive at 15,000 feet, where the difference amounts to 30 degrees at least.* [This is contrary to the conclusions of all meteorologists who have studied the climate of the Alps, and is entirely due to the local disturbances which I have so often dwelt upon, and principally to the unequal distribution of moisture in the loftier rearward regions, and the aridity of Tibet. Professor James Forbes states (Ed. Phil. Trans., v. xiv. p. 489):--1. That the decrement of temperature with altitude is most rapid in summer: this (as I shall hereafter show) is not the case in the Himalaya, chiefly because the warm south moist wind then prevails. 2. That the annual <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> diminishes with the elevation: this, too, is not the case in Sikkim, because of the barer surface and more cloudless skies of the rearward loftier regions. 3. That the diurnal <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> diminishes with the height: {{that this is not the}} cane follows from the same cause. 4. That radiation is least in winter: this is negatived by the influence of the summer rains.] The accompanying table is the result of an attempt to approximate to the mean temperatures and ranges of the thermometer at various elevations.|$|E

But {{even if there are}} such, which planetoscopists doubt, they must be very different creatures in form and function from any we know on this one small world of ours. For just consider, Frida, what we mean by life. We mean a set of simultaneous and consecutive changes going on in a complex mass of organised carbon compounds. When most people say 'life,' however,--especially here with you, where education is undeveloped--they aren't thinking of life in general at all (which is mainly vegetable), but only of animal and often indeed of human life. Well, then, consider, even on this planet itself, how special are the conditions that make life possible. There must be water in some form, for there's no life in the desert. There must be heat up to a certain point, and not above or below it, for fire kills, and there's no life at the poles (as among Alpine glaciers), or what little there is depends upon the intervention of other life wafted from elsewhere--from the lands or seas, in fact, where it can really originate. In order to have life at all, as WE know it at least (and I can't say whether anything else could be fairly called life by any true analogy, until I've seen and examined it), you must have carbon, and oxygen, and hydrogen, and nitrogen, and many other things, under certain fixed conditions; you must have liquid water, not steam or ice: you must have a certain restricted <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature,</b> neither very much higher nor very much lower than the average of the tropics. Now, look, even with all these conditions fulfilled, how diverse is life on this earth itself, the one place we really know--varying as much as from the oak to the cuttle-fish, from the palm to the tiger, from man to the fern, the sea-weed, or the jelly-speck. Every one of these creatures is a complex result of very complex conditions, among which you must never forget to reckon the previous existence and interaction of all the antecedent ones. Is it probable, then, even a priori, that if life or anything like it exists on any other planet, it would exist in forms at all as near our own as a buttercup is to a human being, or a sea-anemone is to a cat or a pine-tree?" ...|$|E
