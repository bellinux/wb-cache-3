Methods: The students randomly were divided in two groups, A (n= 25) and B (n= 22) that received a routine course and simulation based education respectively. The chain of experiments was concerned to evaluate of skills proficiency and reduction error in clinical situation. These experiments includes, time and quality of iso-center setup for linear accelerator, geometrical error in patient positioning, time and accuracy for <b>radiation</b> <b>axis</b> and gantry angle. All experiments were designed in a human phantom. Statistical analysis were performed as the mean and standard deviation with a significance level of p-value < 0. 05. Results: The duration time for iso-center setup in group A and group B was 4. 17 ± 0. 76 min and 2. 45 ± 0. 80 min respectively. The geometrical error in group B was smaller than the group A (p< 0. 05). The time average for selection of <b>radiation</b> <b>axis</b> in group B was less than 15 sec (81. 8 % (n= 22)) versus 15 - 25 sec (75 %(n= 25)) in group A (p< 0. 01). The tasks correctness for group B was better than the group A (p< 0. 05). Also time duration for gantry angle in prone and supine position for group B was smaller than the A group, 72. 7 % less than 1. 5 min (n= 22) versus 16. 7 % (n= 25) respectively.

The integrated setup consists of a THz photomixer which is feeding a quasi-optical double slot antenna structure. Outset is taken in the physical model of a p-i-n diode photomixer implemented in Advanced Design System, Agilent. Several physical properties {{are added to the}} existing p-i-n model. Additionally the model is extended to a n-i-p-n diode model which can be employed in the n-i-p-n superlattice photomixer concept. The p-i-n diode and the nipn diode are modeled in the Verilog-A hardware description language and integrated into Advanced Design System. A double slot antenna design for 1 THz is proposed and simulated in an electromagnetic simulation tool. The design integrates photomixer, feeding network and biasing.

40|$|When {{massive stars}} form, they emit strong, {{hydrogen}} ionising radiation fields into their molecular cloud environment, forming HII regions. This {{is believed to}} be capable of inducing effects which can trigger further star formation through a process known as Radiative Driven Implosion. Hydrodynamic shock fronts are generated at the interface between ionised and un-ionised material. These shocks propagate into the clouds, and their motion and increase in density can result in the conditions required for star formation. Using the method of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics, the effect of varied initial geometrical and physical properties of a molecular cloud on the prospect of radiation triggered star formation is investigated over a large parameter space. The physical processes of the model include a detailed ray-tracing implementation of the ionising radiation, along with a thermodynamic model and chemical evolution for multiple species of atoms. A parameter d_euv, defined as the ratio of the initial ionising penetration depth to the scale length of the cloud along the <b>radiation</b> <b>axis,</b> was found to be an effective indicator of the final evolutionary prospects of the molecular clouds investigated. Low d_euv clouds typically exhibit shock front motion which converges on a focus or foci, and form symmetric or asymmetric B or C type Bright Rimmed Clouds depending on orientation. At medium d_euv there is a mixture of focus/foci convergent and linear or filamentary structure formation with cores formed indirectly, after disruption of material by the shock fronts. At high d_euv only fragment-core and irregular structures form, with the clouds being increasingly dominated by photoevaporation. At extremely high d_euv cores cannot form and the cloud will photoevaporate. In addition, qualitative impressions of the scope of structure morphologies, especially those for irregular morphologies, is compiled. Of note, it is found that the simple initial conditions of a uniform prolate cloud at inclinations to incident radiation are capable of producing a wide variety of the structures observed at HII boundaries...|$|E

40|$|Geological {{materials}} {{have been exposed}} continuously to natural ionizing radiation. Electron spin resonance (ESR) has been developed recently as one of dating techniques, which utilize radiation-induced defects like thermoluminescence (TL) and fission track detection. The methodology of ESR dating is as follows: 1. Detection of radiation-induced ESR signal in the sample. 2. Obtaining the accumulate dose of natural radiation (AD) received by the sample, by a sample calibration with additive artificial radiation, 3. Calculation of the age with the AD divided by the annual average dose of natural radiation (D). We have investigated ESR measurement of radiation-induced defects of a carbonate fish fossil found in northeastern Brazil. The geological period in which such a fish inhabited is called the Cretaceous (from 64 to 140 million years ago) in the Mesozoic era. ESR spectra were measured at the X-band on a JEOL JES-MS- 3 X spectrometer. The g value was obtained by referring to ESR spectra of 2 + Mn in MgO and DPPH. Resonance signal was observed at room temperature. The ESR spectra of the fish fossil is shown on {{the upper part of}} the figure, together with its g values which agree with those of CO 3," center (1). Two ESR intensities increase linearly with radiation dose of 60 Co y rays, as shown in the figure.

40|$|In {{a typical}} free {{electron}} laser (FEL), the electron beam interacts with a dipole undulator that has a sinusoidal magnetic field variation; the electron motion is sinusoidal in the plane transverse to this field and emits odd-numbered harmonic <b>radiations</b> along the <b>axis.</b> However, one need not limit the choice of undulator field profile to the sinusoid, providing other profiles result in significant advantages. In connection with the IFEL accelerator, in the past we {{have pointed out that}} the use of an undulator profile that approximates a square wave will result in an enhanced acceleration gradient, by as much as a factor of two (equivalent in effect to an increase of laser drive intensity by a factor of four). This improvement (essentially at the fundamental FEL resonance) results largely from the fact that, for a given peak undulator field amplitude, the rms electron acceleration obtained from the square wave undulator is larger than that from the sinusoid; furthermore, the electron orbit is stable as well. In this paper, we find additional advantages that should result particularly at harmonic numbers f > 1 if the undulator field profile is nearly ''square wave'': namely, a large enhancement of the harmonic spontaneous power radiated, together with enhanced FEL gain. The modification of undulatory to enhance FEL gain has been examined in the past, usually with a particular design in mind, but with similar conclusions...|$|R

This report highlights two specific areas that will provide further PPA technology enhancements, namely, an optimal gamma-ray detection system and the off <b>axis</b> <b>radiation</b> detection sensitivity. Detection of low-atomic number (Z) shielded nuclear material had been initially addressed by the inclusion of dedicated Geiger-Müller (GM) detectors co-located above each of the Photonuclear Neutron Detectors (PNDs). Several different radiation detectors were investigated to assess if this type of gamma-ray detector was optimal. The LND 719 GM detector was shown {{to have the best}} photon sensitivity and demonstrated an optimal ability to detect low-Z shielded nuclear material. Beyond the technical performance of this detector, its low cost and availability makes it a logical choice for a field-deployable system. In terms of off-axis detection sensitivity, simulation and benchmarking experiments have indicated that the PPA inspection system can successfully detect nuclear material (within 120 seconds) in various shielding configurations even when it is located at a distance of as much as 30 cm off the interrogating beam axis (the exact sensitivity to off-axis interrogations will be largely dependent on the actual shielding material). As a general rule, high-Z shielding will allow detection at larger off-axis distances than low-Z materials...|$|R
40|$|Resumen del trabajo presentado al CPAN Workshop on Technology Transfer, celebrado en Sevilla (España) del 24 al 25 de junio de 2013. [...] et al. In complex {{radiation}} therapy treatments with photons, such as Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), dose distribution verification is highly advisable prior to real dose delivery to patient. In fact, the increasing sophistication {{and complexity of}} IMRT treatments is a major challenge for Treatment Planning Systems (TPS), which might miscalculate under some circumstances. We have developed a detection system for radiation therapy treatment verification based on a single sided silicon strip detector (SSSSD) housed inside a cylindrical phantom. This work started {{in the frame of}} the project Radia, a collaboration between the University of Seville, Instalaciones Inabensa S. A. (a company of Abengoa group), CNA and the Virgen Macarena University Hospital of Seville. In our system, the detector is placed inside the cylindrical phantom with the detector plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cylinder, and parallel to the <b>radiation</b> beam <b>axis.</b> This allows to obtain dose maps in axial planes, which are the most relevant in the process of treatment planning since they correspond, in general, to the orientation of the CT slices of the patient used during such process. This is the main innovation with respect to other recently developed systems, based on diode and ionization chamber arrays. The cylindrical phantom is rotated so that data are taken for different relative orientations between the detector strips and the radiation fields. A software has been developed to operate the rotation of the phantom and to acquire the signals from the silicon strip detector. The dose maps are calculated from the set of data recorded for a certain sequence of relative orientations, using a reconstruction algorithm similar to that of computed tomography. A patent application of this procedure has been submitted to the Spanish Office of Patents (expedient nº P 201101009). Presently we are working on a new prototype, with these main improvements: -A new detector, featuring a special configuration designed in collaboration with the Spanish company ATI Sistemas S. L., built by Micron Semiconductor Ltd. (UK). It consists of a dual chip 32 x 32 SSSSD, mounted back to back and using materials with densities {{as close as possible to}} water density. -New electronics and software for phantom rotation control and for data acquisition and analysis, improving sensitivity, linearity and measurement bandwidth. Its performance is boosted with automated algorithms. -A new phantom, more versatile than the previous one and with a better control of angular position. -A new reconstruction algorithm to obtain the dose maps.

Devices such as the Sun Nuclear, DQA 3 are effective tools for analysis of daily dosimetry including flatness, symmetry, energy, field size and central <b>axis</b> <b>radiation</b> dose measurement. The DQA 3 can be used on the treatment couch of the linear accelerator or on a dedicated table/bed for superficial and orthovoltage x-ray machines. This device is levelled using its dedicated feet. This work has shown that depending on the quantity of backscatter material behind the DQA 3 device, the position of the levelling feet can affect the measured central axis dose by up to 1. 8 % (250 kVp and 6 MV) and that the introduction of more backscatter material behind the DQA 3 can lead to up to 7. 2 % (6 MV) variations in measured central axis dose. In conditions where no backscatter material is present, dose measurements can vary up to 1 %. As such this work has highlighted the need to keep the material behind the DQA 3 device constant as well as maintaining the accuracy of the feet position on the device to effectively measure the most accurate daily constancy achievable. Results have also shown that variations in symmetry and energy calculations of up to 1 % can occur if the device is not levelled appropriately. As such, we recommend the position of the levelling feet on the device be {{as close as possible to}} the device so that a constant distance is kept between the DQA 3 and the treatment couch and thus minimal levelling variations also occur. We would also recommend having no extra backscattering material behind the DQA 3 device during use to minimise any variations which might occur from these backscattering effects...|$|R
40|$|We present multiaperture spectropolarimetric {{observations}} of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 1068. The nuclear region of NGC 1068 was observed with three apertures (4. 3 sec x 1. 4 sec., 1. 0 sec., and 0. 3 sec.) by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These ultraviolet data allow us to study the scattered, nuclear light without the complication of polarization dilution caused by strong unpolarized starlight. In particular, we can determine the mechanism of the scattering and the size scale of the scattering region. Our data confirm the findings of Antonicci & Miller (1985) and Code et al. (1993). Shortward of 2700 A, the continuum polarization is constant, P is approximately 16 %, at a position angle of 97 deg, indicating electron scattering as the mechanism for the polarization. In addition, the narrow-line emission is much less polarized than the continuum, and two broad lines, Mg II lambda lambda 2796, 2804 and C III lambda 1909, are seen in polarized flux Ly-alpha and C IV {{are not included in}} our spectral region). The total flux data also indicate that from approximately 2200 A to approximately 3000 A, the spectrum of NGC 1068 is strongly affected by blended Fe II emission. These polarimetry data are explained by the occulation/reflection model proposed by Antonucci & Miller (1985). According to this model, NGC 1068 harbors a Seyfert 1 nucleus which is obscured along the line of sight by an opaque torus. The symmetry axis of the torus is alinged with the radio <b>axis.</b> <b>Radiation</b> from the broad-line region and feature continuum source can escape along the poles of the torus where it is scattered to us. This scattered light receives a partial linear polarization, perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the torus. Our measurements of the relative fluxes and polarized fluxes in the three apertures indicated that the scattering region is spatially extended on a scale of approximatley 1 sec. Also, in the 0. 3 sec aperture, {{and to a lesser extent}} in the 1. 0 sec aperture, the polarization is is somewhat higher, and the position angle somewhat lower, than in largest aperture. Presumably, isolating the central part of the relecting region results in less geometrical cancellation of the polarization and an angle indicative of the location of the innermost scattering paricles...|$|R
40|$|At the Laboratory of Acoustic Imaging and Sound Control, much {{research}} {{is done in}} the field of room acoustics. The impulse response is widely regarded as the most meaningful characteristic in room acoustics. For a certain combination of source and receiver position, the impulse response is the sound pressure at the receiver position as a function of time generated by an acoustic pulse emitted at the source position. A major requirement for the source is omnidirectionality: the source must radiate acoustic energy equally in all directions. In 1980, Beentjes [2] has developed an acoustic source consisting of a 32 -face source sphere and a separate bass loudspeaker. This source radiates omnidirectionally from 60 to 2800 Hz. Taking in account that the range of interest is from 50 to 5000 Hz, a successor is desirable. In the present research, the utility of a rotating loudspeaker for room response measurements is investigated. In theory, reproducing a linear frequency sweep with a rotating source results in decomposition of the directivity of the source. The contributions of the mono-pole, dipole and higher order pole terms to the directivity pattern of the source are separated. A monopole is omnidirectional, thus the response to an omnidirectional source can be calculated. Simulations confirm the theory, the directivity is decomposed. Use of a ‘normal’ linear frequency sweep results in a required measuring time of at least 100 minutes, which is not acceptable. Use of parallel linear frequency sweeps reduces the required time to a couple of minutes. A disadvantage of parallel sweeps is that the position of the turntable at the beginning must be the same as the position at the ending of the measurement. This requires a very constant angular velocity of the turntable. Doppler effects have a large influence on the impulse response. Doppler effects result in a complex directivity, resulting in many higher order pole contributions to the impulse response. In addition, the power spectrum gets the shape of a sinc-function, with a smaller central peak for a higher angular velocity. Experiments confirm the results of the simulation. The impulse response of a rotating loudspeaker under anechoic conditions shows many peaks at the positions corresponding to monopole, dipole and higher order poles. The S/N ratio in room measurements is 65 dB at best and 40 dB at worst, which is a very promising result. Using better equipment, the S/N ratio can become even higher. The rotating source in combination with a frequency sweep is a promising tool for impulse response measurements in rooms. The idea of creating a monopole with one loudspeaker is elegant and the achieved S/N ratio is very good. A negative point is the high demand on the measuring equipment (a very constantly rotating turntable is necessary). A problem that has not been investigated in this research, is the extension to 3 D. A rotating speaker has only a monopole directivity component in a horizontal plane perpendicular to the rotation <b>axis.</b> <b>Radiation</b> {{in the direction of the}} rotation axis is not influenced by the rotation. Therefore, a loudspeaker rotating on one axis does not radiate isotropically. Acoustical Imaging and Sound ControlImaging Science & TechnologyApplied Science...|$|R
40|$|THE UNIVERSITY OF MANCHESTER ABSTRACT OF THESIS {{submitted}} by Ken Darzy for the Degree of M. D. and entitled 'Pharmacological and physiological studies of anterior pituitary hormones secretion (GH, ACTH and TSH) in cranially irradiated adult cancer survivors with radiation-induced hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction'. Month and Year of submission: June 2008. This thesis describes {{the dynamics of}} GH, ACTH/Cortisol and TSH/T 4 secretion in adult cancer survivors irradiated for non-pituitary brain tumours or leukaemia. Stimulated and physiological hormonal secretions were studied simultaneously. It was shown that, in patients with severe radiation-induced GH deficiency diagnosed by failure to pass both the ITT and the GHRH + AST, pulsatile GH secretion and diurnal rhythm are preserved, yet with severe amplitude attenuation and an overall feminised pattern of GH secretion characterized by relatively higher inter-peak levels (tonic secretion) and increased secretory disorderliness, as measured by ApEn. Patients with normal individual peak GH responses to the ITT and the GHRH+AST still showed evidence of damage to the h-p axis, as the overall mean GH responses were reduced by 50 %. However, spontaneous fed and fasting GH secretion in this group was fully maintained both individually and at a group level compared with a matched control group. This finding argues against the previously held belief that somatotroph dysfunction is primarily due to radiation-induced GHRH deficiency, as the combined effect of reduced GHRH and secondary somatotroph atrophy {{would be expected to}} result in reduced spontaneous GH secretion. It was, therefore, concluded that radiation causes direct pituitary damage and that endogenous hyperstimulation of the h-p axis mediated by a compensatory increase in GHRH release restores normality of GH secretion in these patients with partially damaged somatotrophic axis (compensated GHD). Based on the findings in some patients, it was also suggested that 'near maximal' endogenous hyper-stimulation and GHRH release may limit further stimulation with the ITT, so much so, that a failed ITT response can occur in the presence of normal GHRH+AST response and normal spontaneous GH secretion.. These findings in adults has lead to the suggestion that failure of the hyperstimulated partially damaged h-p axis to increase GH secretion during periods of increased demand, such as growth and puberty may explain what has previously been described as radiation-induced GH neurosecretory dysfunction. It was reasonable to conclude that unlike the ITT, a failed response to the GHRH+AST almost always indicated GHD in the irradiated adult. On the contrary, failure to pass the ITT reflects 'a potential failure of the h-p axis to respond to increased demands and therefore it should remain the gold standard guide for the need for GH replacement therapy in children. Adult cancer survivors with normal ACTH reserve indicated by normal cortisol responses to the ITT have showed parallel and significant increases in fed and fasting 24 -hour integrated cortisol concentrations and secretion rates with no change in half-life. This has been attributed to a pro-active h-p-adrenal axis with increased CRH-ACTH release mediated by the direct effects of <b>radiation</b> on the <b>axis</b> or perhaps the higher level of chronic stress in cancer survivors. In addition, euthyroid adult cancer survivors have significantly increased stimulated and integrated 24 -hour TSH levels, especially in spinally irradiated patients with severe GHD. There was no change in the TSH bioactivity and the increase in TSH levels could be attributed to subclinical thyroidal damage, GHD-induced reduction in somatostatin tone and/or radiation-induced reduction in somatostatin and dopamine tone. The maximum TSH surge in the. 24 -hour profile was slightly but significantly reduced. The subnormal nocturnal TSH surge seen in some patients reflected a shift in the timing of the peak and/or nadir TSH levels rather than a genuine loss of the TSH diurnal rhythm, as similarly seen in some normal individuals. This finding argues against the existence of so-called hidden central hypothyroidism. In summary, this thesis has provided novel insights into the pathophysilogy and site of radiation damage and its relevance to the clinical application ofthe diagnostic tests currently in use.
