50|$|The {{original}} engine had 110 hp (82 kW) {{and gave}} the car {{a top speed of}} 90 mph.Suspension was Henry Ford-era transverse springs front and <b>rear,</b> with <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> front and torque tube rear, already quite outdated when the car was introduced. Brakes were cable-activated for 1936 to 1938; 1939 and onwards were hydraulic. The Zephyr was the first Ford product to have an all-steel roof, except the late 1931 Model AA truck.|$|R
50|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>axle,</b> {{also called}} a lazy axle, {{is not part}} of the drivetrain, but is instead free-rotating. The rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a <b>dead</b> <b>axle.</b> Many trucks and {{trailers}} use <b>dead</b> <b>axles</b> for strictly load-bearing purposes. A <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> located immediately in front of a drive axle is called a pusher axle. A tag <b>axle</b> is a <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> situated behind a drive <b>axle.</b> <b>Dead</b> <b>axles</b> are also found on semi trailers, farm equipment, and certain heavy construction machinery serving the same function. On some vehicles (such as motorcoaches), the tag axle may be steerable. In some designs the wheels on a lazy axle only come into contact with ground when the load is significant, thus saving unnecessary tire wear.|$|R
50|$|Several {{manufacturers}} offer computer-controlled airlift, so {{that the}} <b>dead</b> <b>axles</b> are automatically lowered when the main axle reaches its weight limit. The <b>dead</b> <b>axles</b> can still be lifted by the press of a button if needed, for better maneuverability.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Despite having fourteen-wheels, The MAZ-7917 is {{technically}} a twelve-wheeled vehicle due {{to one of}} the axles being unpowered (a <b>dead</b> <b>axle).</b> Because of this, the vehicle is a 14×12 instead of a 14×14.|$|R
50|$|The {{coach was}} 40 feet long, eight {{feet wide and}} almost 11 feet tall. It weighed 26,100 {{unloaded}} and 34,485 loaded. Unlike the future Scenicruiser, the GX-2 had its driving wheels {{at the very back}} of the coach. The intermediate tag axle, also called the <b>dead</b> <b>axle,</b> differed in having two wheels instead of four later.|$|R
50|$|The Noble uses a unibody frame {{based on}} a {{shortened}} Suzuki Alto platform. It carries the same MacPherson strut independent front suspension and a <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> <b>rear</b> suspension with a Panhard stabilizing rod. The body is constructed using high tensile and ultra high tensile steel, a choice that makes the car somewhat heavy for its size at 875 kg.|$|R
50|$|Mini {{choppers}} {{often use}} bicycle or moped rims and tires on front and large pneumatic tires in the rear. Commonly golf cart wheels or 205/50-10 style tires {{are used in}} the back. The rear also needs something to let the wheel spin, and that's where the axle comes in. There are two different types of axle setups used; a live and a <b>dead</b> <b>axle.</b>|$|R
50|$|Developed {{primarily}} {{for use as}} a Topol ICBM mobile launcher, the 7912 model is similar in design to the MAZ-547A but has seven axles instead of six, including one <b>dead</b> <b>axle.</b> In the mid-1980s, the MAZ-7917 variant was introduced, with an additional length of 1 m and crew cabins similar to the MAZ-7916 - and at present, the 8-axle MZKT-79221 variant is used to carry the Topol M, Topol's replacement.|$|R
5000|$|The Car de Luxe was an American {{automobile}} manufactured from 1906 until 1910. A sister marque to the Queen, the Car de Luxe had {{overhead valves}} which were operated by one rocker per cylinder. The 40/50 hp, 6755 cc car was actuated by a [...] "push-pull" [...] rod and an unusual back axle; the load was further taken by an I-beam <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> which carried a separate differential unit.|$|R
50|$|A {{live axle}} {{is a type}} of beam axle in which the shaft (or shafts, since live axles, while {{connected}} to move as a single unit, are seldom one piece) also transmits power to the wheels; a beam axle that does not also transmit power is sometimes called a <b>dead</b> <b>axle.</b> While typically used in vehicles with Hotchkiss drive, this suspension system can also be used with other types of power transmission.|$|R
50|$|The Edison-Beach {{battery railcar}} was {{developed}} by Thomas Edison and Ralph H. Beach. The latter headed the Railway Storage Battery Car Company and the Electric Car & Locomotive Corp. Car No. 105 of the Alaska Railroad was an Edison-Beach car. A notable feature of the Edison-Beach cars was the Beach drive system. Each wheel was mounted on ball bearings on a <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> and was driven by an individual traction motor through gearing.|$|R

50|$|The stagecoach was a four-wheeled vehicle {{pulled by}} horses or mules. The primary {{requirement}} {{was that it}} was used as a public conveyance, running on an established route and schedule. Vehicles that were used included buckboards and <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> wagons, surplus Army ambulances and celerity (or mud) coaches. On the outside were two back seats facing one another, which the British called 'baskets'. In addition to the 'stage driver' who guided the vehicle, a 'shotgun messenger', armed with a coach gun, often rode as a guard beside him.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{probably}} feed on detritus. Larvae {{have been}} <b>reared</b> on <b>dead</b> oak leaves.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> Kunzea ericoides and from an {{unidentified}} rotten log on the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Adults {{have been}} found mostly in forests. Larvae have been <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> wood and {{decaying}} organic material[...]|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> wood of apple (probably Malus domesticus) and from dead {{branches}} of Melicytus ramiflorus.|$|R
50|$|The larvae feed on Chrysanthemum species, {{including}} aster, blackberry and verbesina. Larvae {{have also}} been <b>reared</b> on <b>dead</b> leaves.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} {{recorded}} on beech, hazel, hemlock, maple, nettle and red spruce. Larvae have been <b>reared</b> on <b>dead</b> oak leaves.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{tremendous}} costs, {{the first}} locomotive, bearing factory number 1 {{and the name}} BORSIG, was finished in 1840. This locomotive had an interior frame, a two-axle front pivoted bogie and an extra <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> behind the only drive axle. On 21 July 1840, Borsig let it compete against a Stephenson-built locomotive on the Berlin-Jüterbog railroad. The Borsig locomotive won by 10 minutes, proving {{that in spite of}} the lack of experience, Germans could build locomotives that were at least as good as the British models, and so the import of locomotives and engineers was no longer necessary. After this victory, the number of orders rose quickly. A further six machines of this type were sold to the Berlin-Stettiner Eisenbahn and the Oberschlesische Eisenbahn in 1842.|$|R
50|$|Designed by Fritz Fiedler, the 326 {{featured}} a box-section frame that could readily be adapted for derivative models. Also innovative were the torsion bar rear suspension, {{inspired by the}} <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> suspension of the Citroën Traction Avant, and the hydraulic braking system, {{the first to be}} used on a BMW car. Styled by Peter Schimanowski, the 326 was offered as a four-door sedan and as a two- or four-door cabriolet. The 326 sedan was the first BMW available with four doors. The BMW 320, BMW 321, BMW 327, and BMW 335 were based on the 326. The streamlined form of the body contrasted with previous relatively upright BMWs: drag was presumably reduced further by including a fixed cover over the spare wheel at the back.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> wood of Pittosporum tenuifolium and Fuchsia excorticata and dead {{standing}} wood of a Coprosma species (probably Coprosma grandifolia).|$|R
25|$|Next, {{the fact}} that in midgear the valve opening should be the same for the piston in both front and <b>rear</b> <b>dead</b> centre {{positions}} is used to find the mid gear position of the pivot between the combination rod and reach rod. In practice the valve spindle length is adjusted to ensure this as part of setting the timing. Also the dimensions of the lead and lap lever are set so that the valve moves twice the lead + lap of the valve.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> {{branches}} of Pseudopanax crassifolius, dead rotten stems of Ripogonum scandens, dead branches of Coriaria arborea and dead Kunzea ericoides.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are {{scavengers}} {{and have}} been <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> sugarcane, dead bark of Artocarpus and other decaying vegetable matter, Plumeria, Reynoldsia and Sicana odorifera.|$|R
50|$|Before World War II (1934), {{the front}} wheel drive Citroen Traction Avant had {{independent}} front torsion bar suspension and a flexible trailing <b>dead</b> <b>axle,</b> also sprung by torsion bars. The flexibility of the axle beam provided wheel location features like a twist beam axle. The Czechoslovakian Tatra cars, designed by professor Hans Ledwinka in the mid-1930s, used all around independent torsion bar suspensions, along with air cooled rear engines. Also in the 1930s, prototypes of the first Volkswagen Beetle incorporated torsion bars—especially their transverse mounting style. Ledwinka's concept had been copied by Ferdinand Porsche, whose successors later had to acknowledge the influence of Ledwinka's sophisticated Tatra models on the Porsche-designed Kdf-Wagen of 1938 (later renamed the Beetle), a post-war lawsuit resulting in a DM3,000,000 settlement paid by Volkswagen to Ringhoffer-Tatra in 1961.|$|R
50|$|The {{biology of}} Acartophthalmus is almost unknown. The adults have mainly {{been found in}} forests, while larvae have been <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> wood and {{decaying}} organic material.|$|R

50|$|The N600 was {{introduced}} to the USA in 1969 as a 1970 model, and was the first Honda automobile to be officially imported to the United States. It was technologically advanced for its time, with an all alloy engine that could achieve 9000 rpm. Engine output was 36 - 45 hp (27 - 34 kW) and the N600 was capable of 81 mph (130 km/h). The lower-powered engine arrived in 1972; with milder cams and lowered compression it gave up some peak power and torque, while allowing for a less peaky delivery and higher drivability. It delivered surprisingly peppy performance because of its light weight (around 550 kg/1100 pounds), due to compact dimensions and some plastic parts (like the boot lid). The brakes on early models were very weak, despite having front discs and servo assistance. Rear suspension was a <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> on leaf springs.|$|R
50|$|The {{four-wheel drive}} Jeffery Quad truck became an {{important}} product for Nash. Approximately 11,500 Quads were built between 1913 and 1919. They served to move material during World War I under severe conditions. The Quad used Meuhl differentials with half-shafts mounted above the load-bearing <b>dead</b> <b>axles</b> to drive the hubs through hub-reduction gearing. In addition, it featured four-wheel steering. The Quad achieved {{the reputation of being}} the best four-wheel drive truck produced in the country. The newly formed Nash Motors became the largest producer of four-wheel drives. By 1918, capacity constraints at Nash meant the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Company began to assemble the Nash Quad under license and Nash patents. Nash became the leading producer of military trucks by the end of World War I. After the war ended, surplus Quads were used as heavy work trucks in fields such as construction and logging.|$|R
5000|$|The {{model was}} {{fitted with a}} [...] inline-six diesel engine, which {{produced}} between , and a gearbox with 8 forward speeds. For the time, Alfa Romeo Mille {{was one of the}} most innovative trucks.Alfa Romeo built the Mille in a rear-wheel drive 4x2 configuration. The Mille could carry 8 metric tons of cargo in the bed and a tow up to 18 tons; a fifth wheel tractor unit version was also made, rated for a 26.2 ton towing capacity. Independent firms offered conversion to three or four axles by adding one or two <b>dead</b> <b>axles,</b> steerable or fixed; maximum bed payload went up respectively to over 10 or 13 tons.Italian Bartoletti made a car transporter version of the Mille in 1963, which could carry up to 8 cars on two levels of the car and trailer.There was also special Mille [...] "Motori Aviazione" [...] made for transportation of aircraft engines made by Alfa Romeo.|$|R
50|$|Larvae {{have been}} <b>reared</b> from mixed <b>dead</b> {{branches}} and from dead twigs of Aristotelia serrata.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>dead</b> <b>axle</b> (or hub and bearings) is {{much less}} common than the live axle setup used on most mini choppers. As opposed to a [...] "live" [...] axle, where the axle spins along with the wheel, this axle does not spin. The wheel or hub has {{built-in}} bearings {{to allow it to}} spin. Depending on the setup, all spinning components are attached to the hub or to the rim itself. The bearings and hub spin on the axle. This is the type of setup that is used on most motorcycles. Often, the axle is inserted into slotted dropouts and the chain is adjusted by moving the wheel forward or backward within the slots. This allows the engine to be mounted which makes the bike's drive train much more rigid and reliable. There are also other advantages to this type of axle, including the possibility of a cleaner and more attractive rear axle area, but this setup is often more expensive than a live axle and custom parts are much more difficult to locate.|$|R
50|$|The larvae are {{scavengers}} {{and have}} been <b>reared</b> from <b>dead</b> or decayed materials including Alectryon macrococcus, Bambusa, banana, Ricinus communis, Clermontia, decayed fruits, dry cow dung, palm fronds, Pipturus, rotten wood, Sicana odorifera, sugarcane and Thespesia populnea. The full-grown larva is 15-18 mm long and dull dirty white.|$|R
