The complete data collection was analyzed using a descriptive statistic method. The research shows that; (1) mining <b>resources</b> <b>scarcity</b> shown by the rate of economic growth for mining sector tends to decrease {{in the last couple}} of years. Apart from that, the <b>scarcity</b> of the <b>resources</b> is identified by the difficulty of founding a profitable mining field either socially or economically.

25|$|The Derg's (1976) Proclamation No: 103 had public {{ownership}} of schools {{consistent with the}} socialist system. This still left a few private schools for children of politicians and wealthy families resulting in a higher quality of education for these children than for all others. Primary schooling expanded throughout the country with national enrolment reaching 34.1%. There were still regional disparities with more resources going to the south than to the north. Educational quality decreased with expansion largely due to <b>resource</b> <b>scarcity.</b> The Derg tried to resolve the problem of teacher shortage by recruiting 5,500 untrained teachers from those who had completed grade 12.

500|$|Author Thomas Homer-Dixon was a 44-year-old {{academic}} and {{director at the}} University of Toronto's Peace and Conflict Studies program {{at the time of}} publication. While the book took eight years to write, Homer-Dixon had been developing the ideas behind it for most of his career. As a youth, an interest in current events was fostered by his parents and led him to study causes of human violence at university. He graduated from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Arts and, in 1989, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a doctorate in Political science. He accepted the director position at the [...] Peace and Conflict Studies program in 1990. Homer-Dixon and his theories were featured in an article written by Robert D. Kaplan, in the February 1994 edition of The Atlantic Monthly, entitled [...] "The Coming Anarchy". The article made him into an emerging academic celebrity and resulted in several book deal offers. By 1997 Homer-Dixon, working out of his home office, had accumulated more than [...] of paper and was overwhelmed by the project, stating, [...] "I'm living the problem I'm describing." [...] In 1999, Homer-Dixon and Princeton University Press published Environment, Scarcity, and Violence containing Homer-Dixon's research on <b>resource</b> <b>scarcity</b> leading to violence. For The Ingenuity Gap, he re-organized the framework along three strands, thematic, geographical, and metaphoric, and structured it like a travelogue from which he could launch examples.|$|E

40|$|The “ethotic turn” in {{contemporary}} political thought {{is yet to}} theorize the sort of ēthos which is pertinent {{to the challenge of}} natural <b>resources</b> <b>scarcity.</b> This essay seeks to address this gap and has therefore two aims: first, tο offer an understanding of ēthos as mode of dwelling on the world; second, to sketch a particular appearance of this dwelling, one that invokes care for human affairs, but also the disposition to pursue justice, which is here affirmed as dike. An ethic that is informed by these two elements, care and dike, disposes us to address contemporary problems such as natural <b>resources</b> <b>scarcity</b> by urging us to think of the current state of affairs not in order to manage it, but to re-arrange it towards a more just direction. Heidegger's ontological scrutiny into “original ethics” proves pertinent to the task undertaken in the essay. We are human,“dwellers,” because we care to achieve a more just, that is less hubristic, rearrangement of the “scheme of things. ...|$|R

Everton’s narrative breadth shows the importance of historical perspectives on Maya landscapes for the conservation {{and development of the}} Maya Forest. Ford’s work converges with Everton’s and they have collaborated in the field and with presentations and publications that demonstrate the value of traditional Maya knowledge. Ford also collaborates with Ronald Nigh, an ethnologist and ecological anthropologist working with traditional Maya farmers. Their book, The Maya Forest Garden: Eight Millennia of Sustainable Cultivation of the Tropical Woodlands, examines both contemporary tropical farming techniques and the archaeological record to make the argument that these ancient techniques, still in use today, can support significant populations over long periods of time. They argue that traditional Maya practices serve as solutions to contemporary problems, such as sustainability, climate change, and natural <b>resource</b> <b>scarcity.</b>|$|E
