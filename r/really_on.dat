He had bombarded defenceless cities and 'killed' civilians, and it was claimed he used false flags and captured signalling equipment. He was praised by the Admiralty for his handling of the fleet, but his opponents in turn felt criticised for their failings. The public felt comforted that such an officer was <b>really</b> <b>on</b> the British side.|$|E

25|$|The chase {{was never}} <b>really</b> <b>on</b> for Bangladesh, who kept their run rate {{steadily}} above 4 an over {{but had to}} see the required rate explode to nearly nine an over. When {{that happened in the}} 28th over, and the score was at 121 for 2, the Bangladeshis tried to hit out, and duly lost three wickets to Dilshan's off spin. Shahriar Nafees was first to fall to Dilshan's spin, having made his second ODI fifty in six games, while Rafique and Ashraful followed shortly afterwards. Forced onto the back foot with the score 140 for 5, Bangladesh put on substitute Tushar Imran, who joined in a partnership of 71 with Bashar in 13 overs. However, the pair scored too slowly to have any chance of winning, instead just trying to save face. Sri Lanka saved their pace bowlers again, opting for Dilshan, Upul Chandana and even the medium pace of Mahela Jayawardene, as they used eight of their eleven possible bowlers in the innings.|$|E
25|$|Although scandalized by Don Ciccio's stories, the Prince at last {{asks the}} {{question}} that's <b>really</b> <b>on</b> his mind—what is Angelica truly like? Ciccio speaks rapturously of her beauty, poise, and sophistication, and then speaks {{about how her}} parents' vulgarity seems to have not affected her. The Prince bristles, and informs Don Ciccio that from now on, because Angelica and Tancredi are to be married, the Serdàras must be spoken about with appropriate respect. Ciccio, who has believed that Tancredi was attempting to seduce Angelica in order to embarrass her father, is horrified. He bursts out that for Tancredi and Angelica to marry will cause {{the end of the}} good qualities of the Salina and Falconieri families. The Prince thinks to himself, however, that the marriage will not be the end, but the beginning. As the Prince and Don Ciccio return to Donnafugata, it is impossible to tell which of them is Don Quixote and which is Sancho Panza.|$|E

25|$|He {{tells them}} {{that a few}} weeks after their shenanigans Chow hijacked half of a $42 million gold heist and, seeing how Alan has been the only one to {{communicate}} with Chow during his imprisonment, deduced that the Wolfpack could locate him and retrieve the gold. Marshall kidnaps Doug and gives the others three days to find Chow, or else Doug will be killed. Alan sets up a meeting with Chow in Tijuana, Mexico, where Stu and Phil will hide and attempt to drug him. However, Alan seemingly, accidentally (but <b>really</b> <b>on</b> purpose) reveals their location and Chow forces them to confess that they are working for Marshall. Chow explains his plan to retrieve the stolen gold from the basement of a Mexican villa he previously owned. Stu, Alan and Phil break into the house and successfully retrieve the gold, but Chow double-crosses them by locking them in the basement, rearming the security system and escaping in Phil's minivan. They are arrested but mysteriously released from the police station. They are picked up by a limousine and taken back to the villa, where they meet up with Marshall.|$|E
25|$|With most Republicans lukewarm about Beeson {{and some}} {{actually}} thinking of abstaining or voting against him, Eisenhower began lobbying conservative Southern Democrats {{to support the}} nomination. On January 29, Senators H. Alexander Smith (chair of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare) and Barry Goldwater then publicly questioned the truthfulness of Beeson's January 20 response about the newspaper article. The newspaper, the San Jose Mercury, said it stood by its story. Beeson then made the surprising request on January 30 to speak again before the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee. The request was granted. Democratic Senator James E. Murray said Beeson's integrity had been called into question, and all six Democrats on the Senate Labor and Public Welfare Committee said that new revelations that Farmer and Beeson had a pre-existing relationship indicated Beeson would not be independent of Farmer's influence. But during a six-hour hearing on February 2, Beeson admitted that the newspaper article was correct. When directly {{asked if he had}} submitted a letter of resignation, he said he had not but had given an oral resignation. He then admitted that he had not stopped making contributions to his company's pension plan, and implied he was <b>really</b> <b>on</b> a leave of absence. He also reversed his January 22 testimony and said Farmer had not recommended him to Eisenhower at all. His revelations led to an adjournment so that Paul L. Davies, president of Food Machinery & Chemical Corporation, could be brought in to testify.|$|E

[...] " [...] was then <b>really</b> <b>on</b> the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part.

500|$|The {{popularity}} of The Quatermass Experiment gained {{the attention of}} the film industry, and Hammer Film Productions quickly purchased the rights to make an adaptation. It was released in 1955, and starred the American actor Brian Donlevy, supported by the English actor Jack Warner, with Val Guest directing and co-writing the screenplay. Nigel Kneale was unhappy with the result, and was especially displeased with the casting of Donlevy as Quatermass. He stated in an interview, [...] " [...] was then <b>really</b> <b>on</b> the skids and didn't care what he was doing. He took very little interest in the making of the films or in playing the part. It was a case of take the money and run. Or in the case of Mr Donlevy, waddle." [...] The film was titled The Quatermass Xperiment to emphasise its X-certificate status. In America the film was renamed The Creeping Unknown after the title Shock! was considered for that territory, and an alternative opening title sequence with that name was prepared.|$|E
500|$|Idol briefly responded {{once more}} to the {{negative}} reception the album received on two occasions. In 1996, Idol gave an interview for his website {{in which he was}} asked if he'd pursue the style of Cyberpunk for a future album. Idol addressed the question by first explaining his interpretation of the failure of the album. [...] "You see the thing about Cyberpunk is that {{it was supposed to be}} like a homemade record, much like these rap bands are doing, all made <b>really</b> <b>on</b> home equipment. But it was very hard to make people understand that I was sort of making an alternative record. They don't allow you to make an alternative record..." [...] He then stated that he would not be pursuing the same style with any future album. In a 2005 interview, Idol simply stated [...] "...the idea that I was trying to do an overground-underground record just wasn't understood at the time." [...] Tony Dimitriades, a prominent music industry producer and manager, interpreted Idol's response at the time. [...] "He realized at that point, 'Well, if that's what people think, maybe I lost touch with my public.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Both Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune and Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune {{felt that}} Morgan gave [...] "his {{best and most}} {{believable}} performance of the season" [...] in [...] "Devil's Trap", with the latter adding, [...] "He was <b>really</b> <b>on</b> fire in that scene, and it brought a whole new intensity to his performance." [...] Diana Steenbergen of IGN found him [...] "menacing, with his low voice and the cruel words... trying to tear them apart emotionally before tearing Dean apart literally", and enjoyed the sadistic and [...] "vicious humor" [...] that makes the character [...] "more sinister". However, she believed that Azazel having a family was an unnecessary parallel with the Winchesters that [...] "doesn't quite make sense". After viewing the episode, Brian Tallerico of UGO gave his opinion that the series should follow Buffy the Vampire Slayer format of having a different recurring villain each season. [...] "If the firestarting demon is the Big Bad {{for the first two}} seasons, that's fine", he commented, [...] "but don't drag it out longer than that. Fans will get bored.

500|$|On {{its initial}} broadcast, the episode was watched by 3.99 million viewers. It {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. Karla Peterson of The San Diego Union-Tribune gave the episode an [...] "A", deeming it [...] "everything the season-closer needed to be". She noted that episode reveals why Azazel killed Jessica and Mary Winchester, {{and enjoyed the}} [...] "creative way" [...] Meg Masters was killed off, feeling the exorcism to be [...] "amazing". Peterson also praised the cliffhanger ending, believing it to be [...] "capable of pulling your eyeballs right out of your head". The acting was also praised, with Jensen Ackles being able to [...] "wring every ounce of blood, sweat and torment out of Dean's photogenically haunted psyche", Jared Padalecki making Sam [...] "real and conflicted", and Jeffrey Dean Morgan giving [...] "his best and most believable performance of the season". Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune collectively referred to [...] "Devil's Trap" [...] and its two preceding episodes as a [...] "really strong trilogy" [...] of [...] "must-see episodes". She found the possessed John to be [...] "Morgan's finest work on the show to date", believing that he [...] "was <b>really</b> <b>on</b> fire in that scene" [...] and [...] "brought a whole new intensity to his performance". She also thought that Bobby Singer's introduction and Meg Masters' exorcism were [...] "well done".|$|E
500|$|The {{character}} David Robert Jones is {{a reference}} to English musician David Bowie, who was born with that name. [...] "In Which We Meet Mr. Jones" [...] was the first appearance of the character. When actor Jared Harris was first cast for the part, he was told Jones was [...] "possibly a major, important character", {{as indicated by the}} episode's title. Whether his character would make a reappearance later in the season depended on how well received Jones was by the show's audience, Harris' performance, and if the writers felt they had more to tell about the character. [...] Harris later described Jones in a May 2009 interview, [...] "I think you could sense that there was a great bit of ambiguity about the character which was useful. He's a bad guy that might be on the right side. He just might be fighting for the good guys. Those guys are always great parts because you leave the audience guessing about what side he's <b>really</b> <b>on.</b> He's one of those guys that if he's fighting for the right cause, he's a tremendous ally. But if he's fighting on the wrong cause, he's a formidable opponent. He's an anti-hero who is fighting for the just cause". Harris asserted in a February 2009 interview that he did not sign a recurring contract, meaning that the character was not meant to be permanent. He affirmed this by believing the character's personality rendered Jones incapable of joining the regular cast, [...] "You'd have to keep [...] chained like a dog. You couldn't let him loose. You certainly couldn't let him use his hands. You know what the f--k he'd do".|$|E
500|$|The {{licensing}} arm of Paramount {{took the}} step of significantly expanding retail distribution beyond specialty stores (Hot Topic, Spencer's) to big chains (Target, J.C. Penney), which involved carefully stripping T-shirts of racy slogans {{from the television}} show. Licensing industry observers credited Comedy Central with carving out a profitable niche in an industry dominated by powerful partnerships that link fast-food chains and Hollywood movie studios, which was particularly tough for South Park, as no fast-food chains wanted to ally themselves with the show's racy content. Eventually, J.C. Penney ended the tie-ins with the show in April 1999 {{as a result of}} customer complaints. On July 7, 1999, Parker and Stone appeared on Late Night with Conan O'Brien to promote the film's release. During the interview, Parker and Stone showed a clip of the film in which a caricature of O'Brien, played by Brett Spiner, hands over Terrence and Phillip to the US government and jumps to his death from the set of Late Night. Upon seeing the clip, a bemused O'Brien responded that his interns saw the film and thought it was [...] "really funny", but were annoyed that the Late Night set was portrayed as {{on the top floor of}} the GE Building, when it was <b>really</b> <b>on</b> the sixth floor. The film also suffered negative publicity before release. It was initially reported that on the day of the Columbine High School massacre, a friend of the killers (Chris Morris) was seen wearing a black T-shirt depicting characters from South Park. Both Parker and Stone come from Colorado, and Stone went to Heritage High School, not far from Columbine High. He proceeded to take three days off from work following the shootings. [...] "Nothing seemed funny after that," [...] he said. South Park was, at the time, generally waning in popularity: ratings dropped nearly 40 percent with the premiere of the series' third season and, according to Entertainment Weekly, [...] "it [...] the pop-culture behemoth it was last year [...]" [...] In response to the decline, Parker commented, [...] "Suddenly we suck and we're not cool anymore. The funny thing is, last year we were saying the same things and we were hip, fresh, and cute. Now they're telling us we're pushing 30, we're failures, and we're sellouts." ...|$|E
