5|$|A raw 3D {{model of}} Jacob's wolf {{was the basis}} for {{creating}} the others. A muscle system, which gave the appearance of muscles firing and flexing, contributed to this model. From there, the initial fur layout went to painters who were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> color and groom. They also added characteristics, such as wet hair clumping together, and applied it to the fur. They refined this look before passing it off to the lighting and technical directors.|$|E
5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into disuse, the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{to merge}} the grammar {{school with the}} two {{secondary}} modern establishments to form a comprehensive school were resisted by the Grammar School's governors; in a voluntary-aided school, the local education authority was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> finances, but the governors and headmaster had autonomy over all other school policy. As {{a result of the}} governors' refusal, the LEA ceased to maintain the school, which became legally independent on 1 September 1983. The separate Queen's Schools, meanwhile, were merged to become a co-educational comprehensive school, now named Thomas Clarkson Academy.|$|E
5|$|The cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is {{an annual}} {{herbaceous}} legume from the genus Vigna. Due to its tolerance for sandy soil and low rainfall {{it is an}} important crop in the semi-arid regions across Africa and other countries. It requires very few inputs, as the plants root nodules are able to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making it a valuable crop for resource poor farmers and well-suited to intercropping with other crops. The whole plant is used as forage for animals, with its use as cattle feed likely <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> name.|$|E
5|$|The {{force at}} Romani, <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> defence when the battle began, {{consisted}} of infantry from the British 52nd (Lowland) Division, commanded by Major General W.

5|$|The {{survival}} {{of a living}} organism depends on the continuous input of energy. Chemical reactions that are <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> structure and function are tuned to extract energy from substances that act as its food and transform them to help form new cells and sustain them. In this process, molecules of chemical substances that constitute food play two roles; first, they contain energy that can be transformed and reused in that organism's biological, chemical reactions; second, food can be transformed into new molecular structures (biomolecules) that are of use to that organism.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s, Dasho Shingkhar Lam, former Secretary to Jigme Dorji Wangchuck and Sixth Speaker of the National Assembly (1971–74), was {{requested}} by the king to make several modifications to the flag; he is <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> current design, which has remained unchanged since 1969. The king was reportedly dissatisfied that the early square Bhutanese flags did not flutter like the rectangular Indian flag displayed on the visit of an Indian official to the country. The standard measurements of the flag of Bhutan were thereafter altered to resemble the flag of India, which was 9 feet by 6 feet.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1774, the species has {{been transferred to}} various Boletaceae genera in its taxonomic history, although it retained the original name given to it by German botanist Jacob Christian Schaeffer until a transfer to genus Suillellus in 2014. Several varieties, a subspecies, and a form have been described by European mycologists. Suillellus luridus is mycorrhizal, forming a symbiotic association with deciduous trees such as oak, birch and beech, and {{has been found to}} have a growth-enhancing effect on conifers in experiments. The fruit bodies are highly attractive to, and often infested by, insects, and several species of fly have been recorded feeding on them. Chemical analyses have revealed some aspects of the mushroom's components, including its volatile flavour compounds, its fatty acid and amino acid compositions, and the identities of the carotenoid compounds <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> colour.|$|E

5|$|Harlan, who had later {{directed}} the propaganda movie Kolberg (1945), {{was the only}} film director of the Third Reich {{to be charged with}} crimes against humanity. Harlan defended himself asserting that he had been neither Nazi nor antisemitic. He claimed that Goebbels had controlled his work and that he should not be held personally <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> content. He recounted the ways in which he had been forced to endure Goebbels' constant haranguing and meddling in the production of the film. In the end, the court condemned the film but exonerated the director. While Harlan had not acted nobly, the court recognized that he had operated under duress and should not be held responsible for the content of the film.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, {{controversy}} {{arose in}} the NP when lawyer Olaf Madsen– who had cooperated with Ola Thommessen for more than 20 years at the newspaper Verdens Gang and was <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> economic decisions– wanted to have more dividend for his investments in the newspaper. Editor Ola Thommessen considered this to be an inappropriate intervention in the editorial part of the newspaper, and took his staff with him and started a new newspaper named Tidens Tegn. Vogt supported Thommessen in his decision, and came {{at odds with the}} chairman of Morgenbladets board, lawyer and politician Edmund Harbitz. Both left Morgenbladet in the summer of 1913 {{as a result of the}} disaccord, although Vogt continued as theatre and literature critic in the paper until his 1927 death. As editor, Vogt was succeeded by C. J. Hambro.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided {{to select a}} site for permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making the producers of radioactive waste <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E

5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} {{the signing of the}} peace, the two states <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> structure, Persia and Sparta, took full advantage of the gains they had made. Persia, freed of both Athenian and Spartan interference in its Asian provinces, consolidated its hold over the eastern Aegean and captured both Egypt and Cyprus by 380 BC. Sparta, meanwhile, in its newly formalized position atop the Greek political system, took advantage of the autonomy clause of the peace to break up any coalition that it perceived as a threat. Disloyal allies were sharply punished—Mantinea, for instance, was broken up into five component villages. With Agesilaus {{at the head of the}} state, advocating for an aggressive policy, the Spartans campaigned from the Peloponnese to the distant Chalcidic peninsula. Their dominance over mainland Greece would last another sixteen years before being shattered at Leuctra.|$|E
5|$|Southern Rhodesia had no {{diplomatic}} powers, but largely oversaw its own {{contributions of}} manpower and materiel {{to the war}} effort, being <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> own defence. Rhodesian officers and soldiers were distributed in small groups throughout the British and South African forces {{in an attempt to}} prevent high losses. Most of the colony's men served in Britain, East Africa and the Mediterranean, particularly at first; a more broad dispersal occurred from late 1942. Rhodesian servicemen in operational areas were mostly from the country's white minority, with the Rhodesian African Rifles—made up of black troops and white officers—providing the main exception in Burma from late 1944. Other non-white soldiers and white servicewomen served in East Africa and on the home front within Southern Rhodesia. Tens of thousands of black men were conscripted from rural communities for work, first on the aerodromes and later on white-owned farms.|$|E
5|$|The Augustinian theodicy is a {{response}} to the evidential problem of evil, which raises the concern that if God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, there should be no evil in the world. Evidence of evil can call into question God's nature or his existence– he is either not omnipotent, not benevolent, or does not exist. Theodicy is an attempt to reconcile the existence and nature of God with evidence of evil in the world by providing valid explanations for its occurrence. The Augustinian theodicy asserts that God created the world ex nihilo (out of nothing), but maintains that God did not create evil and is not <b>responsible</b> <b>for</b> <b>its</b> occurrence. Evil is not attributed existence in its own right, but is described as the privation of good– the corruption of God's good creation.|$|E
