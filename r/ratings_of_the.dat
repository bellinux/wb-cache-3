5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James Gilbert and Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. Gilbert and Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E
5|$|That fall, CBS Reports, a news/documentary {{program at}} 7:30(et) on Wednesdays, was blamed {{in the press}} for the sharp drop off in the <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Beverly Hillbillies– the comedy had been number one in its first two seasons, but dropped to eighteenth when CBS Reports became the Hillbillies lead-in for its third season. (Hillbillies had aired at nine o'clock before moving up a half hour in 1964.) CBS responded by moving CBS Reports to Mondays.|$|E

5|$|Lawson {{was next}} signed to BBC Two {{to host a}} three-part cookery show {{entitled}} Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, which began on 6 December 2006 and aired weekly. The first two episodes secured the second highest <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> week for BBC Two, with the first episode debuting with a strong 3.5 million. The final episode {{went on to become}} the top show on BBC Two the week that it was aired. Nigella's Christmas Kitchen won Lawson a second World Food Media Award in 2007. Her influence as a food commentator was also demonstrated in late 2006, when after she had lauded goose fat as being an essential ingredient for Christmas, sales percentages of the product increased significantly in the UK. Waitrose and Tesco both stated that goose fat sales had more than doubled, as well as Asda's goose fat sales increasing by 65% from the previous week. Similarly, after she advised using prunes in a recipe on Nigella's Christmas Kitchen, Waitrose had increased sales of 30% year on year.|$|E

50|$|Depression {{has quite}} a well-evidenced link with a {{decrease}} in the motive to self-enhance. Depressives are less able to self-enhance in response to negative feedback than non-depressive controls. Having a depressive disposition decreases the discrepancy between one's own estimates of one's virtues and <b>the</b> estimates <b>of</b> a neutral observer, namely by increasing modesty. Illusions of control are moderated by melancholy. However, whilst <b>the</b> self-ratings <b>of</b> depressives are more in line with those of neutral observers than <b>the</b> self <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> normals, <b>the</b> self <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> normals are more in line with those of friends and family than <b>the</b> self <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> depressives.|$|R

40|$|A puzzling {{question}} {{arising from}} imagery research is why no {{relationship has been}} found between self-reports of imagery and performance on spatial tests thought to require <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> imagery. To investigate this, spatial ability, measured by performance on two spatial tests, was compared with performance on <b>the</b> Vividness <b>of</b> Visual Imagery Questionnaire (VVIQ; Marks, 1973) and a newly constructed imagery questionnaire. <b>The</b> choice <b>of</b> items and <b>ratings</b> for the new questionnaire was based on Kosslyn's (1980, 1994) theories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagery system. <b>Ratings</b> on the new questionnaire consistently correlated significantly with performance on the spatial tests, whereas ratings from the VVIQ did not. The new <b>ratings</b> captured more <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagery process than <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> vividness alone, but the largest change depended upon <b>the</b> type <b>of</b> item imagined. <b>Ratings</b> <b>of</b> items <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same type as used on the spatial tests predicted performance on the spatial tests, whereas vividness <b>ratings</b> <b>of</b> items recalled or constructed from long-term memory did not. Participants can successfully introspect on several different properties of their images, and their ratings do predict performance on tasks thought to require imagery. <b>The</b> large effect <b>of</b> item type raises questions about <b>the</b> predictive value <b>of</b> existing models <b>of</b> <b>the</b> imagery system especially in relation to <b>the</b> role <b>of</b> phenomenological properties of our images...|$|R
