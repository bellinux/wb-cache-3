To {{the north of the}} D21 terminus, the route a part of the European route E751 connects the cities of Koper, Slovenia, and Trieste, Italy, via G11 in Slovenia. The first section of the D21 route follows an overall eastern orientation. About [...] away from the borderline, it reaches the Kaštel border crossing, and after , there is an at-grade intersection where the traffic defaults to D510, which serves as a connector to the A9 motorway.

30|$|Routes in {{opposite}} directions, as in situation (h), are not allowed. Figure  7 h shows two <b>route</b> <b>segments,</b> coming from east and west, {{very close to}} each other. No matter if these <b>route</b> <b>segments</b> {{belong to the same}} route or not, this situation is illegal. Further route planning would result in a situation where overlapping routes run in different directions. Packets {{would not be able to}} path both routes. To implement this criterion, the target module checks if the route overlaps with the neighborhood of another route. Parallel running routes whose neighborhoods overlap should be excluded as (i). The reason for the two prohibitions is that possible deadlocks arise from these situations which are not covered by the implemented deadlock prevention. For the deadlock prevention, only intersections and direction changes are monitored.|$|R

40|$|Purpose. Walking can be {{incorporated}} into most people’s daily routines if the process is made convenient by a well-designed built environment. Walkability rarely is assessed in the workplace, where adults spend much of their time. Methods. From existing tools, we developed an instrument to audit walkability at a single government agency’s facilities, which were located in multiple states. We used a five-point scale to evaluate nine elements of walkability: pedestrian facilities, pedestrian-vehicle conflicts, crosswalks, route maintenance, walkway width, roadway buffer, universal accessi-bility, aesthetics, and shade. Weighted scores ranged from 20 to 39 (poor), to 40 to 69 (fair), to 70 to 100 (good). Results. Of 79 walking <b>route</b> <b>segments</b> surveyed on 10 agency campuses, 34 % were rated poor, 32 % fair, and 34 % good. Repeat assessment of 20 walking <b>route</b> <b>segments</b> by three independent observers yielded similar scores. Conclusion. Facility planners may find this walkability instrument useful in identifying and eliminating barriers to convenient walking opportunities in workplaces such as offic...|$|R
40|$|In the {{transport}} of radioactive material (RAM), e. g., spent nuclear fuel (SNF), stakeholders are generally most concerned about risks in high population density areas along transportation routes because of the perceived high consequences of potential accidents. The most significant portions of a transcontinental route and an alternative examined previously were evaluated again using population density data derived from US Census Block data. This method of characterizing population that adjoins <b>route</b> <b>segments</b> offers improved resolution of population density variations, especially in high population density areas along typical transport routes. Calculated incident free doses and accident dose risks for these routes, and the rural, suburban and urban segments are presented for comparison of their relative magnitudes. The results indicate that modification of this route to avoid major metropolitan areas through use of non-Interstate highways increases total risk yet does not eliminate a relatively small urban component of the accident dose risk. This conclusion is not altered by improved resolution of <b>route</b> <b>segments</b> adjoining high density populations...|$|R
40|$|Estimation of the {{potential}} radiological risks associated with highway transport of radioactive materials (RAM) requires input data describing population densities adjacent to all portions of the route to be traveled. Previously, aggregated risks for entire multi-state routes were adequately estimated from population data with low geographic resolution. Current demands for geographically-specific risk estimates require similar increases in resolution of population density adjacent to <b>route</b> <b>segments.</b> With the advent of commercial geographic information systems (GISs) and databases describing highways, U. S. Census Blocks, and other information that is geographically distributed, it became feasible to determine and tabulate population characteristics along transportation routes with 1 -kilometer resolution. This report describes an automated method of collecting population data adjacent to <b>route</b> <b>segments</b> (for calculation of incident-free doses) based on a commercial GIS. It also describes a statistical method of resolving remaining resolution issues, and an adaptation of the automation method to collection of data on population under a hypothetical plume of contamination resulting from a potentia...|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>route</b> <b>segment</b> of the filed {{flight plan}} does not usually change during the flight itself, the STAR to be flown might well vary {{according}} to the weather, the runway or approach in use, or the need to safely separate air traffic, among other factors. Thus a filed flight plan typically ends some distance from touchdown, where a STAR begins, and that is usually assigned and communicated to the pilot during the flight planned portion of the flight.|$|E
50|$|On May 6, 1902 {{along the}} way of the former omnibus route, tracks were laid, from Draakplaats to Nieuwstraat.

For a time of work, omnibuses which became unused temporarily replaced horse drawn cars. On July 9, 1902 horse drawn cars started to move on a former omnibus <b>route</b> <b>segment</b> from Nieuwstraat to Grote Markt.|$|E

The roadway is still a dirt road, about 12 ft wide. It was historically used by the Butterfield Overland Mail service between 1858 and 1861.|$|E

To create airline schedules between any airport pair, a network-building module has been developed using the Official Airline Guide (OAG) that provides flight segment information. Flight fares for routes are extracted from Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB 1 B). The observed segment passenger flows between airport pairs are also obtained from DB 1 B.
