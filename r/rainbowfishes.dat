500|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{exists in}} some species. Individuals of one sex, usually males develop {{secondary sexual characteristics}} that increase their chances of reproductive success. In dolphinfish, males have larger and blunter heads than females. In several minnow species, males develop swollen heads and small bumps known as breeding tubercles during the breeding season. The male green humphead parrotfish has a more well-developed forehead with an [...] "ossified ridge" [...] which {{plays a role in}} ritualised headbutting. Dimorphism can also take the form of differences in coloration. Again, it is usually the males that are brightly coloured; in killifishes, <b>rainbowfishes</b> and wrasses the colours are permanent while in species like minnows, sticklebacks, darters and sunfishes, the colour changes with seasons. Such coloration can be very conspicuous to predators, showing that the drive to reproduce can be stronger than that to avoid predation.|$|E

50|$|The Bedotiidae are {{a family}} of fish known as the Madagascar <b>rainbowfish,</b> Madagascan <b>rainbowfish,</b> or Malagasy <b>rainbowfish</b> due to their {{endemism}} to Madagascar. It includes two genera, Bedotia and Rheocles.|$|R
50|$|The blue-eyes are {{a family}} of atheriniform fish, the Pseudomugilidae, related to the <b>rainbowfishes.</b> They inhabit fresh and {{brackish}} water in Australia, New Guinea and nearby smaller islands. Blue-eyes are small fish, typically no more than 5 cm in length. Like rainbowfish, they spawn all year round, and attach their eggs to vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|... 'M. fluviatilis' forms {{schools in}} slow-flowing {{freshwater}} rivers, wetlands and billabongs. They inhabit rivers, drains, creeks, ponds and reservoirs, and occasionally stagnant water. They inhabit temperature ranges between 22 and 25°C. As their range is the southernmost of all <b>rainbowfishes,</b> Australian rainbowfish {{are the only}} species adapted to low winter temperatures of 10 to 15°C.|$|E
50|$|For {{freshwater}} community tanks, {{there are}} large numbers of species that make successful community fishes. Most of the livebearers, barbs, tetras, rasboras, danios, and <b>rainbowfishes</b> are peaceful, though a few species are fin nippers, most notably tiger barbs and serpae tetras. Angelfishes, gouramis, and Corydoras catfishes are also popular, though angelfish are predatory and will eat very small fish such as neon tetras and livebearer fry. If neon tetras are kept around fish unlikely {{to take advantage of}} their small size, they are very peaceful towards other fish.|$|E

40|$|The <b>rainbowfishes</b> of {{the family}} Melanotaeniidae {{represent}} {{one of the largest}} radiations of freshwater fishes from the Indo-Australian archipelago. A total of 75 nominal species have been described, among which several have become very popular among tropical fish hobbyists because of their tendency to form large schools of colourful individuals. Facing habitat loss and competition or predation by introduced species, this group has become a priority in the conservation of ornamental fishes in Indonesia. In this context, several expeditions have been conducted between 2007 and 2010 in Indonesian Papua with the aim to initiate a large-scale survey of the genetic resources in this group. We assessed the diversity of the Papua <b>rainbowfishes</b> with DNA barcoding. We sequenced the mitochondrial COI gene for 350 specimens belonging to 53 nominal species throughout the Indo-Australian archipelago. Unexpected levels of cryptic diversity and endemism were detected since additional cryptic lineages were detected in several watersheds from the Vogelkop and the Lengguru massif. DNA barcoding supports the presence of nearly 30 evolutionary lineages among the 15 nominal species sampled in the Vogelkop and all these lineages are endemic to a single lake or watershed. This result highlights that the diversity {{of the family}} ha...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{new species}} of <b>Rainbowfishes</b> are {{described}} from the Birds Head region by combining a cytochrome oxydase I gene (COI) phylogeny, 12 microsatellite loci and diagnostic morphological characters. The new species Melanotaenia klasioensis, M. longispina and M. susii belong to the "Central Ayamaru Plateau" cluster in the COI phylogeny and are genetically allied to M. ajamaruensis, M. boesemani, M. ericrobertsi and M. fasinensis. A Factorial Component Analysis made on the multilocus microsatellite genotypes reveals that these new species are genetically distinct {{from each other and}} from other species known from the area. With the same approach, we also describe M. manibuii, a species belonging to the "Northern Birds Head" mitochondrial clade and M. sembrae, a species genetically close to M. multiradiata. Three additional new species, M. naramasae, M. rumberponensis and M. sikuensis, belong to the "Birds Neck" cluster and are genetically allied to M. angfa and M. parva. The microsatellite markers were also used to distinguish M. angfa from M. parva, two species sharing the same mitochondrial haplotype. For the sake of comparison, the equivalent morphometric data are provided in appendix for the 20 valid species already described from the Birds Head area...|$|E

50|$|In the wild, the Running River <b>rainbowfish</b> is {{confined}} to a 13 km stretch of Running River, isolated between two gorges. In August 2015, ecologists Peter Unmack and Michael Hammer discovered that eastern <b>rainbowfish</b> had been introduced into the upper section of Running River, and were hybridising and introgressing with the Running River <b>rainbowfish.</b> Due to this hybridisation threat, the Australian Society for Fish Biology listed the Running River <b>rainbowfish</b> as critically endangered in September 2016.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rainbowfish</b> {{usually do}} best with {{tropical}} community fish, such as tetras, guppies, and other <b>rainbowfish.</b> However, two males may sometimes fight at breeding season {{if there are}} not enough females. <b>Rainbowfish</b> usually eat floating flakes in captivity, because in the wild they will often eat insects floating on the surface.|$|R
