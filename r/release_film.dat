500|$|Being {{a remake}} of an iconic film, and the starcast involved, Don {{was one of the}} most {{anticipated}} films of the year.

Jean Servais, Robert Manuel, and Jules Dassin are perfect." [...] French critic André Bazin said that Rififi brought the genre a [...] "sincerity and humanity that break with the conventions of a crime film, and manage to touch our hearts". In the February 1956 issue of the French film magazine Cahiers du cinéma, the film was listed as number thirteen in the top twenty films of 1955. The film was well received by British critics who noted the film's violence on its initial release.

500|$|In 1995, Lundgren {{appeared}} in Robert Longo's Johnny Mnemonic, co-starring Keanu Reeves.

The film was premiered in Japan first on 15 April 1995 and features a previously composed score by Michael Danna, different editing, and more scenes with Lundgren and Japanese star Takeshi Kitano. Critical response was negative overall; Roger Ebert said, [...] "Johnny Mnemonic {{is one of the great}} goofy gestures of recent cinema, a movie which doesn't deserve one nanosecond of serious analysis." [...] The film was a financial disappointment, grossing $19,075,720 in the domestic American market against its $26m budget. The cloak worn by Lundgren in the film is now located in the lobby of the Famous Players Coliseum in Mississauga, Ontario, it was his last theatrical <b>release</b> <b>film</b> until 2010.
