For this purpose, antibiotics Vancomycin, Kanamycin and Isoniazid were labelled with 99 mTc and their potential as infection imaging agent for diagnosis of infection was evaluated. Labelling of the drugs with 99 mTc was achieved using SnC 12 H 2 O as reducing agent. The optimum conditions for labelling and the effects of various factors such as ligand/ reductant ratio, pH, and incubation times were also studied. Radiochemical purity and stability of 99 mTc-vancomycin, 99 mTc-kanamycin and 99 mTc-isoniazid was determined by thin layer chromatography. Biodistribution studies of labelled complexes were performed in a model of bacterial infection in Sprague-Dawley rats.
