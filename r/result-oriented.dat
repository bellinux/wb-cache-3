In order to become more sustainable the future economy will transform from “sale of goods” to the “sale of services”. Belz and Peattie also stress the role of services as a part of sustainable solution, talking of product-related, use-oriented and <b>result-oriented</b> services. Product-related services are offered additionally and they optimize the product use, e.g. automobile companies offering courses on a more ecological and safe driving manner. In the case of use-oriented services, a service and not a product is sold to the consumer e.g. car-sharing. As for <b>result-oriented</b> services, consumers neither own nor operate a product e. g. public transportation, with consumers only enjoying the outcome of the product, the transportation services.|$|E

5000|$|In his 2000 book, The Warren Court and American Politics, Powe contended {{the flaw}} in the tenure of Chief Justice Earl Warren was an attempt at social {{engineering}} {{at the expense of}} fidelity to the Constitution.

Powe writes that 'it is difficult to speak of an overriding jurisprudence apart from the results reached.' But what were the right results? What drove the Court? For Powe, the answer is straightforward: 'From the justices' points of view, the Court's prime role was to facilitate the policies ordained by the elected branches.'" ...|$|E
5000|$|The IMF has {{outlined}} five core {{principles for}} the process through which PRSPs are elaborated.

It should also be <b>result-oriented</b> by focusing on outcomes that will benefit the poor, comprehensive in exploring and understanding the multidimensional nature of poverty, partnership-oriented by involving development partners such as the government, domestic stakeholders, and external donors. Lastly, {{the development of the}} PRSP should be based on a long-term perspective geared towards reducing poverty. These core principles are central to the goals of the PRS process.|$|E
5000|$|In {{his later}} years on the bench, Roberts was the only Justice on the Supreme Court not {{appointed}} (or {{in the case of}} Stone, who had become Chief Justice, promoted) by President Franklin D.

Roberts dissented bitterly in the 1944 case of Smith v. Allwright, which in finding the white primary unconstitutional overruled an opinion Roberts himself had written nine years previously. It was in his dissent in that case that he coined the oft-quoted phrase that the frequent overruling of decisions [...] "tends to bring adjudications of this tribunal into the same class as a restricted railroad ticket, good for this day and train only." ...|$|E
5000|$|Universal Tolerance Organization (UTO) is an {{independent}} non-governmental humanitarian organization based in Drammen, Norway. Established in 2012, the organization aims to contribute to global peace, security, justice, democracy, {{respect for human rights}} and sustainable development through understanding the concept of positive/active tolerance and its application in practice. Furthermore, it encourages the idea that all kinds of discrimination can be prevented, eliminated or reduced through true realization of active/positive tolerance in every aspect of life. These aspects include religious, political, cultural, ethnic and social norms, rights, structures and traditions. This way we have started to analyse problems associated with all types of intolerance from psychological, sociological, philosophical, legal and historical perspectives. In line with <b>result-oriented</b> approaches, the UTO also attempts to use a pool of expertise to introduce strategies and activities, as solutions, to tackle problems of intolerance through constructive, sustainable and peaceful means ...|$|E
50|$|Holmes in his {{earliest}} writings established a lifelong {{belief that the}} decisions of judges were consciously or unconsciously <b>result-oriented,</b> and reflected the evolving mores of the class and society from which judges were drawn. Holmes accordingly argued that legal rules are not deduced through formal logic but rather emerge from an active process of human self-government. He explored these theories in his 1881 book The Common Law. His philosophy represented {{a departure from the}} prevailing jurisprudence of the time: legal formalism, which held that law was an orderly system of rules from which decisions in particular cases could be deduced. Holmes sought to consciously reinvent the common law—to modernize it as a tool for adjusting to the changing nature of modern life, as judges of the past had done more or less unconsciously. He has been classed with the philosophic pragmatists, although pragmatism is what he attributed to the law, rather than his personal philosophy.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1990s, Faria was {{involved}} in a gun control debate regarding the CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC). Faria felt that the NCIPC's program on gun violence was biased against gun owners, promoting [...] "politicized, <b>result-oriented</b> research." [...] In March 1996, Faria testified before the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee for Labor, Health, and Human Services to that effect stating, [...] "I have yet to see a published report that has been funded by the NCIPC in which the benefits of firearms in the hands of law-abiding citizens have been published even though they are there ... if you don't conclude that guns are bad and {{that they need to be}} eradicated because they are a 'public health menace,' they are not published." [...] Congress eventually prohibited the CDC from funding gun research and proscribed public health officials from using taxpayer's money in lobbying and participating in politically partisan activities.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{plurality}} opinion signed by Justices Gerry L. Alexander and Charles W. Johnson, Justice Barbara Madsen wrote that [...] "Under this standard, DOMA is constitutional because the legislature {{was entitled to}} believe that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples furthers procreation, essential {{to the survival of}} the human race, and furthers the well-being of children by encouraging families where children are reared in homes headed by the children's biological parents." [...] Justice Gerry L. Alexander issued a separate concurring opinion, emphasizing the possibility that the legislature or people could expand the definition of marriage in the state. Justice James M. Johnson also issued a separate opinion, co-signed by Justice Richard B. Sanders, which concurred in the judgment only and suggested that the lower court rulings that held DOMA unconstitutional were <b>result-oriented</b> and disregarded the law. The reasoning in Madsen's plurality opinion {{is similar to that of}} New York's highest court in Hernandez v. Robles, which was decided on July 6, 2006.|$|E
5000|$|Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are {{documents}} {{required by the}} International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank before a country {{can be considered for}} debt relief within the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative. PRSPs are also required before low-income countries can receive aid from most major donors and lenders. [...] The IMF specifies that the PRSP should be formulated according to five core principles. The PRSP should be country-driven, <b>result-oriented,</b> comprehensive, partnership-oriented, and based on a long-term perspective. The PRS process encourages countries to develop a more poverty-focused government and to own their own strategies through developing the plan in close consultation with the population. A comprehensive poverty analysis and wide-ranging participation are vital parts of the PRSP formulation process. There are many challenges to PRS effectiveness, such as state capacity to carry out the established strategy. Criticism of PRSP include aid conditionality, donor influence, and poor fulfillment of the participatory aspect.|$|E
