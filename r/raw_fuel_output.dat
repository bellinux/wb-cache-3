40|$|The {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} {{to obtain a}} syngas provides a competitive means for clean FT（Fischer-Tropsch）liquid fuels from renewable resources. The feasibility of the process depends on the upgrading of <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas from gasifier to desired syngas. In this paper, partial oxidation reforming of biomass <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas with addition of 3 - 8 mol % O 2 were investigated over nickel based monolith catalysts prepared by wet impregnation of NiO {{on the surface of}} cordierite. The composition of producer syngas was analyzed by gas chromatogram (GC) and gas chromatogram- mass spectrum (GC-MS). The carbon deposition on the surface of catalyst was analyzed by method of thermogravimetry. The results showed that partial oxidation reforming process had excellent performance of upgrading biomass <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas. Under the reforming temperature of 780 ℃, above 99 % of biomass tar and other hydrocarbons in the <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas was converted into H 2 and CO. Only trace lighter hydrocarbons (< 1 mg/Nm 3) as aerosol and 0. 2 mol % CH 4 were remained in the syngas. No coke deposition was detected during 108 h lifetime test, which indicated that the addition of O 2 can effectively prohibit the coke formation on the surface of catalyst. The H 2 /CO ratio of producer syngas can be adjusted from 1. 2 to 2. 5 with addition of steam, which was suitable to the synthesis of FT liquid fuels. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} {{to obtain a}} syngas provides a competitive means for clean energy from renewable resources. The feasibility of the process depends {{on the performance of}} catalyst for upgrading of the <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas from gasifier. The highly stable NiO-MgO catalyst (Ni/(Ni +Mg) = 15, atomic ratio) was prepared by co-precipitation method for the reforming of <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas. Its performance was investigated under practical conditions of biomass gasification. The Ni(0. 03) Mg(0. 97) O and Ni/MgO catalysts (Ni/(Ni+Mg) = 15, atomic ratio) were also prepared for comparison. The NiO-MgO catalyst exhibited excellent reducibility and highly stable activity for the reforming of <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas without prereduction. No deactivation and very little carbon deposition were observed during 100 h lifetime test. The results of characterization (H(2) -TPR, TGA, XRD, XPS) indicated that the formation of nickel-magnesium solid solution inhibited the sintering of nickel particles for high temperature reaction. Due to Ni(2 +) ions diffusion, the Ni/Mg atomic ratio decreased gradually with increasing depth. The highly stable activity was attributed to the small nickel particles size, high dispersion of nickel particles in the solid solution structure, and the promotion by catalyst reducibility.

50|$|Like most {{gasoline}} stoves, the Svea 123 uses {{an inverted}} bell-shaped burner {{topped with a}} flame spreader (sometimes called a “target burner” or “plate burner” design). As the vaporized fuel exits the jet, it shoots upward and strikes {{the bottom of the}} flame spreader, where it mixes with air that is drawn into the burner housing by convection and, more importantly at higher flow rates, by Bernoulli effect entrainment. The air/fuel mixture flows around the bottom of the flame spreader where it burns with a blue flame. In this type of burner design, flame efficiency depends on how fast the vaporized fuel strikes the flame spreader and on how well the air and vaporized fuel mixes beneath the flame spreader (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone). As a result, this design works best at high <b>fuel</b> <b>output</b> levels; efficient combustion is indicated by a blue flame. As the <b>fuel</b> <b>output</b> is decreased (i.e., when the control valve is turned down) the velocity with which the fuel exits the jet is also decreased, and fuel mixing (i.e., the amount of turbulence in the air/fuel mixing zone) is likewise decreased. At very low <b>fuel</b> <b>output</b> levels, the <b>fuel</b> will no longer exit with sufficient velocity to fully strike the flame spreader and combustion will consequently be very inefficient, usually indicated by a yellow flame.|$|R

The design and operation of this-system were preliminarily discussed. Reforming of biomass <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas over NiO-MgO/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts was investigated in a multi tube reformer. The anti coking and anti-sintering properties of NiO-MgO/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalysts were Characterized. The {{results showed that the}} NiO-MgO/gamma-Al 2 O 3 /cordierite monolithic catalyst with a pore channel size of 7 x 7 mm could continuously deal with biomass <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas containing large amounts of fly ash.

The pressure drop, of the reformer was only below 700 Paeven under the conditions of fuel gas velocity of 1. 4 m/s and fly ash content of 330 g N- 1 m(- 3) in the <b>raw</b> <b>fuel</b> gas. The synthesis gas [H- 2 + CO > 60 vol %, H- 2 /CO ratio = 0. 9 - 1. 0, and lower heating value (LHV) > 10 MJ N- 1 m(- 3) ], could be produced by the biomass-gasification-reforming process under the conditions of total equivalence ratio (ERT) of 0. 27 (ERfirst of 0. 23, ERsecond of 0. 02, and ERthird of 0. 02) and steam/biomass (S/B) ratio of 0. 4. The cold gas efficiency was above 82 %. The characterization of the spent catalysts thermogravimetic (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) analyses indicated that the NiO-MgO solid solution structure in the catalyst could restrain the active Ni- 0 centers from agglomeration and decrease carbon deposition.

40|$|The {{gasification}} {{reactivity of}} the chars from both raw and torrefied wood, grape marc, and macroalgae {{has been investigated}} in this paper. The variations in char gasification reactivity were explained using further investigation of the physicochemical characteristics of the char that can influence the gasification reactivity, i. e., specific surface area, uniformity of the carbonaceous structure, and concentration of alkali metals (Na and K). It {{was found that the}} influence of the torrefaction process on the char gasification reactivity strongly depends upon the solid fuel properties and pyrolysis conditions. For a pyrolysis temperature of 800 °C, the gasification reactivity of the chars from both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae was lower than that of the chars from their corresponding <b>raw</b> <b>fuels.</b> This is mainly due to a lower specific surface area and a lower content of alkali metals (Na and/or K) in the chars produced from both the torrefied grape marc and the torrefied macroalgae than for those chars produced from their corresponding <b>raw</b> <b>fuels.</b> However, the opposite influence of torrefaction was found for the macroalgae char when the pyrolysis temperature was increased to 1000 °C. This is attributed mostly to the higher Na content and the more amorphous carbonaceous structure for the torrefied macroalgae char than for the raw macroalgae char. Peijun Guo, Woei L.
