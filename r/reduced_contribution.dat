Sufficient absorber must be used to <b>reduce</b> <b>contributions</b> to image density by beta radiation from uranium- 238 daughters. When appropriate absorbers are used, the density of the image of a uranium-containing fuel rod is proportional to the uranium- 235 enrichment in that rod.

Methods are discussed for <b>reducing</b> <b>contributions</b> to the image density of any single rod from radiation produced by all other rods in the assembly. The technique is useful for detecting missing rods, dummy rods, and rods containing depleted uranium. These defects can be detected by visual inspection of the autoradiographs.

40|$|We combine {{samples of}} nearby galaxies with Herschel {{photometry}} selected on their dust, metal, HI and stellar mass content, and compare these to chemical evolution models {{in order to}} discriminate between different dust sources. In a companion paper, we used an HI-selected sample of nearby galaxies to reveal a subsample of very gas-rich (gas fraction > 80 per cent) sources with dust masses significantly below predictions from simple chemical evolution models, and well below M-d/M-* and M-d/M-gas scaling relations seen in dust and stellar-selected samples of local galaxies. We use a chemical evolution model to explain these dust-poor, but gas-rich, sources {{as well as the}} observed star formation rates (SFRs) and dust-to-gas ratios. We find that (i) a delayed star formation history is required to model the observed SFRs; (ii) inflows and outflows are required to model the observed metallicities at low gas fractions; (iii) a <b>reduced</b> <b>contribution</b> of dust from supernovae (SNe) is needed to explain the dust-poor sources with high gas fractions. These dust-poor, low stellar mass galaxies require a typical core-collapse SN to produce 0. 01 - 0. 16 M-circle dot of dust. To match the observed dust masses at lower gas fractions, significant grain growth is required to counteract the <b>reduced</b> <b>contribution</b> from dust in SNe and dust destruction from SN shocks. These findings are statistically robust, though due to intrinsic scatter it is not always possible to find one single model that successfully describes all the data. We also show that the dust-to-metal ratio decreases towards lower metallicity...|$|E

The existing breeds of these species have not been selected for milk yield, at the exception of the Sicilo Sarde nucleus in Tunisia (Atti et al. 2006), where the vicinity with Sicily and the Ottoman colonization have induced an old tradition of cheese consumption made from ewe milk. Thus, the official figures reveal that milk from non cattle species (small ruminants and camel) represents respectively 21.3, 5.1 and 3.7 % of the overall output in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia (FAO STAT 2012), and its industrial processing remains rather weak.
