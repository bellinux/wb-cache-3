30|$|There {{are over}} 100 genera {{containing}} approximately 3000 species in <b>Rosaceae</b> which is medium-sized, but of high economic importance (Potter et al. 2007). As {{the third most}} important economical family in temperate regions, many edible fruits like apple (Malus), loquat (Eriobotrya), pear (Pyrus) and peach (Prunus) as well as ornamental plants such as rose (Rosa) are included. However, till now, phylogenetic relationships within <b>Rosaceae</b> family have been uncertain. Traditional morphological studies divided <b>Rosaceae</b> into 4 subfamilies including Spiraeoideae, Maloideae, Rosoideae and Prunoideae according {{to the type of}} fruit (Kalkman 1988). Molecular studies however, put forward different opinions that <b>Rosaceae</b> was divided into three subfamilies: Dryadoideae, Rosoideae and Spiraeoideae (Potter et al. 2007). As the plastid genome can offer useful phylogenetic information, several plastomes of <b>Rosaceae</b> plants have been sequenced and reported, such as Malus domestic ([URL] Pyrus pyriofolia (AP 012207.1), Prunus persica (HQ 336405) and Fragaria virginiana (NC_ 019602). Most of these studies focused on the comparative analysis and evolutionary studies within genera. Wang et al. (2013) reported the chloroplast genome of Prinsepia utilis and reconstructed phylogenetic relationships within <b>Rosaceae</b> but with low bootstrap values. So more closely related plastid genomes are needed to deal with intrafamilial classifications within <b>Rosaceae.</b>|$|R
40|$|Artículo de publicación ISIThe plant family <b>Rosaceae</b> is {{comprised}} of a highly diverse group of plants, {{with a wide range}} of ornamental and agricultural uses throughout the world. Comparative genomic analyses between rosaceous species are increasingly being used to assign putative function. With the wealth of new data, there is a need to standardize nomenclature to ensure uniformity and clarity across research groups. The <b>Rosaceae</b> Gene Name Standardization Committee was formed to develop a naming guideline for genes in <b>Rosaceae</b> family members. This manuscript details the issues involved with naming genes and proposes a common nomenclature system. The Genome Database for <b>Rosaceae</b> (GDR) (www. <b>rosaceae.</b> org) has developed a gene database that will support user-submitted gene names and annotations in addition to the predicted genes from whole genome sequences. GDR also hosts user-curated lists of gene class symbols. To facilitate standardization of gene names and avoid misinterpretation, the committee recommends that the GDR serve as the database of record for the names of <b>Rosaceae</b> genes and that gene names, gene class symbols, and gene annotation be registered in GDR prior to publication in peer reviewed journal...|$|R

40|$|The Genome Database for <b>Rosaceae</b> (GDR) is {{a central}} {{repository}} of curated and integrated genetics and genomics data of <b>Rosaceae,</b> an economically important family which includes apple, cherry, peach, pear, raspberry, rose and strawberry. GDR contains annotated databases of all publicly available <b>Rosaceae</b> ESTs, the genetically anchored peach physical map, <b>Rosaceae</b> genetic maps and comprehensively annotated markers and traits. The ESTs are assembled to produce unigene sets of each genus and the entire <b>Rosaceae.</b> Other annotations include putative function, microsatellites, open reading frames, single nucleotide polymorphisms, gene ontology terms and anchored map position where applicable. Most of the published <b>Rosaceae</b> genetic maps can be viewed and compared through CMap, the comparative map viewer.

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Rosaceae</b> include {{numerous}} economically {{important and}} morphologically diverse species. Comparative mapping between the member species in <b>Rosaceae</b> have indicated {{some level of}} synteny. Recently the whole genome of three crop species, peach, apple and strawberry, which belong to different genera of the <b>Rosaceae</b> family, have been sequenced, allowing in-depth comparison of these genomes. Results Our analysis using the whole genome sequences of peach, apple and strawberry identified 1399 orthologous regions between the three genomes, with a mean length of around 100 kb. Each peach chromosome showed major orthology mostly to one strawberry chromosome, but to more than two apple chromosomes, suggesting that the apple genome went through more chromosomal fissions {{in addition to the}} whole genome duplication after the divergence of the three genera. However, the distribution of contiguous ancestral regions, identified using the multiple genome rearrangements and ancestors (MGRA) algorithm, suggested that the Fragaria genome went through a greater number of small scale rearrangements compared to the other genomes since they diverged from a common ancestor. Using the contiguous ancestral regions, we reconstructed a hypothetical ancestral genome for the <b>Rosaceae</b> 7 composed of nine chromosomes and propose the evolutionary steps from the ancestral genome to the extant Fragaria, Prunus and Malus genomes. Conclusion Our analysis shows that different modes of evolution may have played major roles in different subfamilies of <b>Rosaceae.</b> The hypothetical ancestral genome of <b>Rosaceae</b> and the evolutionary steps that lead to three different lineages of <b>Rosaceae</b> will facilitate our understanding of plant genome evolution as well as have a practical impact on knowledge transfer among member species of <b>Rosaceae.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Rosaceae</b> fruit allergy is {{frequently}} associated with birch pollinosis in Central and Northern Europe and with grass pollen allergy in Central Spain. The main cross-reactive structures involved for birch pollinosis are Bet v 1 and profilin, and for grass pollinosis they are profilin and carbohydrate determinants. <b>Rosaceae</b> fruit allergy can occasionally {{be observed in}} patients without pollinosis. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the clinical presentation and the allergens involved in allergy to <b>Rosaceae</b> fruit without pollinosis. METHODS: Eleven patients from Central Spain allergic to apples, peaches, and/or pears but not to pollens were compared with 22 control subjects with combined grass pollen and fruit allergy. Skin prick tests and RASTs to apple, peach, and pear were performed. Cross-allergenicity was studied by RAST inhibition. Bet v 1 was tested with an indirect RAST, and profilin was tested in skin prick tests, histamine release, and RAST. RESULTS: <b>Rosaceae</b> fruit allergy without pollinosis is severe with 82 % of patients reporting systemic symptoms, mainly anaphylaxis (73 %), whereas oral symptoms are less frequent (64 %). Anaphylactic shock was observed in 36 % of patients. The fruit allergens involved showed cross-reactivity among <b>Rosaceae</b> species but were not related to profilin or Bet v 1. Ninety-one percent of patients with combined grass pollinosis and fruit allergy reported oral allergy, 45 % reported systemic symptoms, 18 % reported anaphylaxis, and 9 % reported anaphylactic shock. CONCLUSION: Allergy to <b>Rosaceae</b> fruits in patients without a related pollen allergy is a severe clinical entity.

40|$|The ethylene-insensitive 3 /ethylene-insensitive 3 -like (EIN 3 /EIL) {{proteins}} are {{a type of}} nuclear-localized protein with DNA-binding {{activity in}} plants. Although the EIN 3 /EIL gene family has been studied in several plant species, {{little is known about}} comprehensive study of the EIN 3 /EIL gene family in <b>Rosaceae.</b> In this study, ten, five, four, and five EIN 3 /EIL genes were identified in the genomes of pear (Pyrus bretschneideri), mei (Prunus mume), peach (Prunus persica) and strawberry (Fragaria vesca), respectively. Twenty-eight chromosomal segments of EIL/EIN 3 gene family were found in four <b>Rosaceae</b> species, and these segments could form seven orthologous or paralogous groups based on interspecies or intraspecies gene colinearity (microsynteny) analysis. Moreover, the highly conserved regions of microsynteny were found in four <b>Rosaceae</b> species. Subsequently it was found that both whole genome duplication and tandem duplication events significantly contributed to the EIL/EIN 3 gene family expansion. Gene expression analysis of the EIL/EIN 3 genes in the pear revealed subfunctionalization for several PbEIL genes derived from whole genome duplication. It is noteworthy that according to environmental selection pressure analysis, the strong purifying selection should dominate the maintenance of the EIL/EIN 3 gene family in four <b>Rosaceae</b> species. These results provided useful information on <b>Rosaceae</b> EIL/EIN 3 genes, as well as insights into the evolution of this gene family in four <b>Rosaceae</b> species. Furthermore, high level of microsynteny in the four <b>Rosaceae</b> plants suggested that a large-scale genome duplication event in the EIL/EIN 3 gene family was predated to speciation...|$|R
