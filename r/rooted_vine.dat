40|$|The genus Dioscorea is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most difficult groups for cyto-taxonomic studies because of the large number and small size of the chromosomes. The objective of the present study was to develop an efficient method of chromosome observation by identifying the optimum time for collecting root samples containing large numbers of metaphase cells. In the present investigation, two breeders’ lines developed at IITA, TDa 98 / 01183 (D. alata) and TDr 95 / 18544 (D. rotundata) which were identified as tetraploids (2 n = 4 x = 40) were used. To take samples for observation, root tips were collected from vine cuttings and seed tuber sets. In the root cells obtained from the seed tuber sets of both cultivars, TDa 98 / 01183 and TDr 95 / 18544, two peaks in the frequency of metaphase cells appeared in the diurnal cycle of cell division. The first peak was observed at seven hours after sunrise (1 : 00 pm) and the second at 19 hours after sunrise (1 : 00 am). In the roots of the seedlings obtained from vine cuttings, the first peak of frequency of metaphase cells appeared at four hours after sunrise (10 : 00 am) in both cultivars and the second peak at 16 hours (10 : 00 pm) in TDa 98 / 01183, but at 13 hours in TDr 95 / 18544 (7 : 00 pm). Based on the results obtained, a cycle of cell division {{is considered}} to exhibit a periodicity of about 12 hours.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} quality {{innovation}} in the grapevine nursery sector. The vegetative propagation of grapevines, scarcely considered by economic research, {{is the first step}} in the wine production chain as it influences both the type and the quality of wines as well as the quality and quantity of the performance of farm investments. This paper gives the results of a study carried out through a structural analysis of both national and regional grapevine nurseries and then through a direct survey of the largest Sicilian nurseries. The survey covers the main structural and productive issues as well as the commercial aspects of eight Sicilian grapevine nurseries and their innovative investments. The middle-low selling price level of Sicilian <b>rooted</b> <b>vines</b> is the result of limited regional marketing which suffers competition from the propagation materials produced by Northern Italy and abroad. So, the companies adopted technological innovations in the production process (paraffin, mulching, cold room storage and warm-house) in order to reduce costs. Innovations of the product to diversify farm production, although less frequent, were also adopted. Consequently, the opportunities for growth in this sector are subject to the companies' ability to upgrade products and differentiate supplies...|$|R

30|$|Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatus L. Lam.) is the world’s sixth most {{important}} food crop consumed after rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), potato (Solanum tuberosum L.), maize (Zea mays L.), and cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) (CIP 2010). It {{is also the}} third {{most important}} root crop grown in eastern Africa after cassava and potato (FAO 2011). Sweetpotato is both a staple and a food security crop in eastern and southern Africa, and is mainly grown by smallholder women farmers (Mutuura et al. 1992; Bashaasha et al. 1995; Andrade et al. 2009). Sweetpotato is also grown for its vines as planting material; leaves are often eaten as a vegetable while shoots and roots are used as animal feed in many countries. In Uganda and western Kenya, the sale of fresh sweetpotato <b>roots,</b> <b>vines</b> and processed foods in both local and urban markets is becoming increasingly popular thus contributing to household cash income (Abidin 2004; Kaguongo et al. 2012).

40|$|This review {{describes}} {{the critical factors}} on which successful grapevine propagation depends and discusses the steps {{that can be taken}} {{to improve the quality of}} planting material available to growers. Spasmodic occurrences of young vine decline and the failure of planting material have plagued the wine industry since the 1990 s. The syndrome now described as Petri disease has been identified as the probable cause of many of the failures, but hot water treatment (HWT) of dormant cuttings (50 °C/ 30 min), for the control of Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and other endogenous pathogens, has also been implicated in the losses. HWT is known to cause a temporary switch to fermentative respiration and early retarded growth in treated material, particularly in Pinot Noir, but the effects of HWT on dormant vine tissue are not yet fully understood. Poor nursery hygiene and poor storage and handling practices during propagation and planting have also been implicated in vine failure. Demand for planting material has exceeded supply and there has been little incentive for nurseries to improve their standards. The quality of planting material could be significantly improved by changing nursery practices, particularly by discontinuing the practice of soaking cuttings in water, treated or untreated, and by improving general standards of nursery hygiene and the management of cool rooms. There is a need to develop a set of universal quality standards for cuttings and <b>rooted</b> <b>vines.</b> Growers also need to be made aware of the characteristics and benefits of high quality planting material...|$|R
