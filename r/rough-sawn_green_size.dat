40|$|In {{order to}} avoid using {{polyvinyl}} alcohol (PVA), an eco-friendly sizing technology with atmospheric pressure plasma treatment and <b>green</b> <b>sizing</b> recipes has been developed and evaluated with respect to sizing properties and desizing efficiency. The {{results show that the}} eco-friendly sizing technology can endow cotton yarn with better sizing properties, including significantly improved size-pick-up, breaking strength, breaking elongation, abrasion resistance and substantially reduced yarn hair, than the traditional sizing technology with the use of PVA. Compared with a typical traditional sizing technology using PVA and modified starch, the optimized eco-friendly sizing technology can impart the yarn an increase of 19. 4 %, 5. 3 %, 3. 4 % and 169. 2 % for the size-pick-up, breaking strength, breaking elongation and the abrasion resistance time, respectively, and a reduction of 59. 3 % for the yarn hairiness index value at level 1. The sizing properties can be obviously improved by the atmospheric pressure plasma treatment, which can roughen the fiber surface, etch away the hydrophobic cuticle layer and introduce polar groups. The glycerol in the <b>green</b> <b>sizing</b> recipes can effectively reduce the yarn hairiness and increase size-pick-up and abrasion resistance. The eco-friendly sizing technology has no observable negative influence on desizing of cotton fabrics. Furthermore, a better water diffusion in the fabric can be achieved because of the improved hydrophilicity by using the plasma treatment. Keyword...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between annual softwood sawmill production and lumber processing variables was ex-amined {{using data from}} Sawmill Improvement Program (SIP) studies of 650 softwood mills. The variables were lumber recovery factor (LRF); headrig and resaw kerf width; total sawing variation, rough <b>green</b> <b>size,</b> and oversizing-undersizing for 4 / 4 and 8 / 4 lumber; planer allowance; and average log diameter and length. All variables except planer allowance and average log di-ameter were significantly influenced by annual sawmill production. The conversion efficiency of the mills in terms of most of these variables increased as sawmill size increased but decreased at annual production levels approaching or exceeding 100 million board feet. Study sawmills were grouped by geographic region and annual production class. Weighted values of LRF, sawing, and resource variables were calculated for each region by weighting by the percentage of mills of that production class in each category.

40|$|High {{porosity}} Nb, Mo-Re, and Ir metals with controlled {{pore size}} {{have been produced}} in various shapes by a powder metallurgy method. Production of these materials involves tailoring the size of powders to attain the correct <b>green</b> pore <b>size</b> for a given packing density through various combinations of presintering, milling, or sieving. Powders were slurry cast into soft tooling to create complex shapes and test pellets, which were then debound and vacuum sintered to the desired density and pore size. With these techniques, densities as low as 35 % may be attained. In the case of spherical powders, the pore size can be accurately predicted using a particle packing equation. In the case of non-spherical powders, the equation predicts a pore size larger than measured. Background: The <b>green</b> pore <b>size</b> of a powder compact {{is a function of}} particle size, particle shape, particle size distribution, and packing density.

40|$|Green {{space has}} a cooling effect that can {{contribute}} to the mitigation of the urban heat island. This study presents an integrated assessment of the cooling effect of green space in Beijing using Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper data and multiple regression analysis. The results showed that the average land-surface temperature for green space was 304. 94 K, which was 5. 32 K lower than that for commercial and residential land. Through analysis of 98 green space sites, this study found that the normalized difference vegetation index difference between a green space site and the surrounding built-up areas, the <b>green</b> space <b>size,</b> and the <b>green</b> space shape affected the cool island intensity of green space (GCII). However, because of its significant multicollinearity with <b>green</b> space <b>size,</b> the <b>green</b> space shape was excluded in the subsequent multiple regression analysis. Furthermore, for green space sites with a size over 10 ha, size had a close relationship with the GCII variances.

40|$|AbstractHong Kong is an ageing society. According to the World Health Organization, an {{estimated}} 22 % {{of its residents}} will be 65 years old or above by the year 2030. Physical activities provide an important way for older people to stay healthy. Green space is recognized as an important environmental setting for physical activity. Therefore, improving elderly accessibility to green space is useful in promoting more physical activity among them. The {{aim of this study}} is to modeling and assessing the elderly accessibility to urban green spaces in Hong Kong, by (1) modeling urban green spaces available for elderly people using the landscape fragmentation index (LFI) of green space patches, and (2) accessibility analysis in terms of both distance and time for elderly people to get urban green space patches. As a result, regions with LFI from high to low and accessibility from good to poor are Kowloon, Hong Kong Island, and New Territories. Kowloon has the highest LFI and accessibility. However, it is limited by small <b>size</b> <b>green</b> space patches which may not be in good quality and attractive for elder people. New Territories, due to its large number of available lands, has the largest proportion of big <b>size</b> <b>green</b> space patches. However, they are limited by their poor accessibility. Based on these evidences, we would suggest the prior improvement (1) in Kowloon is to have more green spaces with larger sizes, (2) in New Territories is to increase the green space accessibility either by improving the walking routes or building more small to median <b>size</b> <b>green</b> space patches that can well cover the whole region...|$|R
