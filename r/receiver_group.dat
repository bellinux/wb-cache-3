25|$|After {{missing the}} playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre {{announced}} that he would return for the 2007 season; it {{would turn out to be}} one of his best. The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13–3, earning a first round bye in the playoffs. The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide <b>receiver</b> <b>group,</b> finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back Ryan Grant, acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42–20. Grant rushed for three touchdowns and over 200 yards, while Favre tossed three touchdown passes and 1 snowball to receiver Donald Driver in celebration.|$|E

40|$|Scalable Reliable Multicast Protocols {{that reduce}} {{processing}} requirements on receivers and senders {{have been the}} subject of much research in recent years. In [12] and [6] we propose a new protocol that <b>groups</b> <b>receivers</b> for error recovery into fixed-size groups, thus reducing their processing requirement to O(1). We expand on this work by applying the concept of Local Recovery to <b>receiver</b> <b>groups,</b> which further improves the processing requirements on the sender while maintaining a constant O(1) requirement on the receivers. Furthermore, we extrapolate the concept of <b>receiver</b> <b>grouping</b> to repair servers resulting in further reduction in the sender’s processing requirements.

50|$|The rifle {{consists}} of two main assemblies: the barreled <b>receiver</b> <b>group</b> and the frame, coupled together {{by means of an}} axis pin located above the trigger guard. The barrel group has an integral MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail used to mount optical sights. The frame or lower receiver contains the trigger group, the bolt and bolt carrier assembly, return mechanism and magazine well. A removable handguard is installed in front of the trigger which completes and encloses the trigger guard.|$|E
50|$|The M79 {{is easy to}} operate. To load, the {{grenadier}} {{pushes the}} barrel locking latch on the <b>receiver</b> <b>group</b> to the right. Gravity will pull down the barrel, opening the action and exposing the breech. The hammer is cocked when the breech is opened. A round then may be loaded. The break action must then be closed manually. Closing the breech will cause the barrel locking latch to return to center. The safety must then be pushed to the forward position in order to ready the weapon for firing.|$|E
50|$|The {{weapons were}} gas {{operated}} with annular gas piston located around the barrel and a vertically moving bolt, {{which made it}} possible to minimise the length of the <b>receiver</b> <b>group.</b> A U-shaped rammer/extractor was used to chamber and extract the cartridge by pushing it into the chamber where after discharge was pulled back from the chamber and again, upon feeding the new cartridge, pushed forward and slightly up into an ejection tube above the barrel where finally exiting above the muzzle. Due to this ejection mechanism it was possible to fire from both right and left arm positions.|$|E
50|$|The system {{consists}} of a phased array <b>receivers</b> <b>grouped</b> in two separate arrays - one composed of 48 LOFAR Low-Band Antennas (LBA) covering the 10-90 MHz band and another composed of 48 LOFAR High-Band Antenna (HBA) covering the 110-270 MHz range. The HBA array is oriented {{in the direction of}} the EISCAT Tromsø radar, which transmits at approximately 224 MHz. Together with the EISCAT transmitter, KAIRA forms a bistatic radar system, capable on performing observation with at least 20 simultaneously beams pointing at different altitudes along the EISCAT transmitter beams.|$|R
40|$|This {{quasi-experimental}} study set out {{to examine}} the effect of peer corrective feedback on feedback givers and receivers in L 2 writing. The forms in focus were a/an, the, and the past tense. The study was conducted in an EFL classroom setting with 45 learners of English in three writing classes which served as the feedback givers, receivers, and the control group.   Over four sessions of treatment, the givers reviewed the writing of the receivers with two functions of English articles (a/an as the first mention and the as the anaphoric reference) and simple past tense (regular and irregular) as the features in focus without receiving any comments from others on their writing. The receivers received feedback from peers, but were excluded from giving any feedback to others. The control group neither gave nor received any peer feedback. The study followed a pretest, immediate post-test, delayed post-test design. Statistical analyses run on the data obtained from a picture description task and a grammaticality judgment task indicated that the givers group improved significantly more than the <b>receivers</b> <b>group</b> and the <b>receivers</b> <b>group,</b> in turn, improved significantly more than the control group in terms of the forms targeted.

50|$|Another {{problem with}} the weapon {{was that it was}} overcomplicated {{compared}} to the M203. It was difficult to disassemble and had many small parts that could be easily lost while cleaning the weapon in the field. Where the M203 broke down into <b>receiver</b> <b>group,</b> barrel group, hand guard group and quadrant sight (the quadrant sight being the smallest piece), the XM148 broke down into barrel, pistol grip, receiver, hand guard, quadrant sight, and several small pins and clips. These issues led the U.S. military to adopt the M203 over the XM148, though the U.S. Air Force did keep a number of the XM148s. In fact U.S. Air Force Security Forces were still being trained on the XM148 in lieu of the M203 as late as 1989. Some security police units still had them in their armories until the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|The AEK-999 {{uses the}} same <b>receiver</b> <b>group</b> as the PKM. The most {{important}} change is a new barrel, made of the same steel used in aviation machine guns for greater durability.

This new barrel can {{be removed from the}} gun for inspection or maintenance, {{but it is not a}} quick-change barrel for swapping out in combat situations. To further enhance its capabilities, the AEK-999 is fitted with a small polymer forend under the barrel, and the folding bipod is moved forward and attached to the barrel rather than the gas tube. If necessary, the AEK-999 can be equipped with a suppressor. It can also accept all standard PKM accessories, including tripod mount, and 100-round clip-on belt boxes.|$|E

50|$|Visually, the M79 grenade {{launcher}} resembles a large bore, break-action, sawed-off shotgun, and is simple in design, having only five major parts: a <b>receiver</b> <b>group,</b> a fore-end assembly, a barrel group, a sight assembly, and a stock. The fore-end assembly beds the barrel to the receiver. The stock {{is made out}} of wood or fiberglass. A rubber pad affixed to the buttstock absorbs some recoil. The front sight is a fixed blade. The rear sight on the M79 is a folding ladder-style leaf-type sight. When folded, the leaf sight acts as a fixed sight for close range. A grenadier may simply point and shoot with high accuracy. When unfolded, the leaf-type sight could be adjusted for ranges from 75 meters to 375 meters, in 25-meter increments. Additionally, Appendix A of U.S. Army field manual for the M203 includes instructions for attaching the M16 rifle grenade sight to the M79's stock and marking the sling for indirect fire at elevations greater than 40°.|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} reliable multicast transport (RMT) protocol techniques that are suited for satellite networks adopt various design techniques that may limit or enhance their scalability to large <b>receiver</b> <b>groups</b> in one-to-many topologies. Satellite networks (with high bandwidth capacity and multi-spot beam support at the Extra High Frequency (EHF) spectrum), may provide a complementary solution to scalability although at a cost. Prolonged link fades due to varying weather patterns predominantly cause packet loss and unnecessary retransmission (form source or receiver) when link is unavailable.

However, the more surprising result for Treadwell, in fact, was not his 40-yard dash time but a disappointing -inch (0.85 m) vertical jump, a half-inch better than he did in Indianapolis. He also completed the 20-yard shuttle in 4.30 seconds and the 3-cone drill in 7.04 seconds. Based on his combine and Pro Day numbers, among the 43 wide receivers that were evaluated in Indianapolis, Treadwell’s 40-yard dash time would have placed him 28th. His twelve reps in the bench press was tied for 22nd within the group and his combine vertical jump tied for 23rd. His broad jump of 9'9" [...] (2.97 m) ranked 12th and his campus numbers in the 20-yard shuttle and 3-cone drill would have placed 17th and 16th, respectively.
