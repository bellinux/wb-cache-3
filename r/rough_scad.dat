It is native to parts of the western Atlantic Ocean, including seas off the eastern coasts of North and South America and the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Diel {{changes in}} feeding {{activity}} and dietary {{composition of the}} <b>rough</b> <b>scad</b> Trachurus lathami were investigated through the analysis of stomach contents of 307 fish sampled over a 24 -h period on the continental shelf off Ubatuba (23 º 35 'S 45 ºW). Stomach contents were analyzed by frequency of occurrence (O%), percent number (N%), percent mass (M%), and feeding index (FI% = O% * M%). <b>Rough</b> <b>scad</b> fed on mollusks (Gastropoda, Crepidula sp.), crustacean (Ostracoda, Copepoda, decapod larvae), chaetognat and teleostean fish. The main items were calanoid copepods (Eucalanus sp. and Centropages sp.). According {{to the analysis of}} the stomach fullness and prey digestion, T. lathami is both a diurnal and nocturnal feeder, showing some seasonal variation in feeding time. According to the Chronobiology concept, it was raised the hypothesis of circadian rhythm in feeding of this fish, probably synchronized by light/dark cycle...|$|E
40|$|We {{present data}} on ichthyoplankton distribution, abundance, and {{seasonality}} and supporting environmental information for four species of coastal pelagics {{from the family}} Carangidae: blue runner Caranx crysos, Atlantic bumper Chloroscombrus chrysurus, round scad Decapterus punctatus, and <b>rough</b> <b>scad</b> Trachurus lathami. Data are from 1982 and 1983 cruises off Louisiana sponsored by the Southeastern Area Monitoring and Assessment Program (SEAMAP). Bioprofiles on reproductive biology, early life history, meristics, adult distribution, and fisheries characteristics are also presented for these species. Maximum abundances of larval blue runner, Atlantic bumper, and round scad were found in July inside the 4 O-m isobath, although {{during the rest of}} the cruises these species were rarely found together. Larval Atlantic bumper were captured in June and July only; blue runner in May, June, and July; and round scad in all seasons. Atlantic bumper larvae, concentrated mostly off western Louisiana, were by far the most abundant carangid in 1982 and 1983. Larval blue runner were the second most abundant summer-spawned carangid in 1982 and 1983, but their abundance and depth distribution varied considerably between years. Relative abundance of larval round scad off Louisiana was low, and they were captured only west of the Mississippi River delta, although they are reported to dominate carangid populations in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. <b>Rough</b> <b>scad</b> were primarily winter/spring and outer-shelf (40 - 182 m) spawners. They ranked third in overall abundance, but were the most abundant target carangid on the outer shelf. Ecological parameters such as surface salinity, temperature, and station depth are presented from capture sites for recently hatched larvae < 2. 5 mm notochord length, except round scad) as well as for all sizes of fish below 14 mm standard length.

40|$|ABSTRACT The <b>rough</b> <b>scad,</b> Trachurus lathami Nichols, 1920, {{is a small}} {{pelagic species}} {{distributed}} along the West Atlantic coast. It is most abundant in the Southern Brazil (28 ° 30 ’- 34 °S) and in the Southeastern Brazilian Bight (SEBB, 22 °- 28 ° 30 ’S). The <b>rough</b> <b>scad</b> is fished by purse seines, which main target is the Brazilian sardine, Sardinella brasiliensis (Steindachner, 1879). Age and growth are vital to understand {{the life cycle of}} a species, to fishery management and ecosystem modeling. This study aimed to assess the age and growth of T. lathami, to identify its age structure in the SEBB, and to evaluate what causes the wide differences among Trachurus species in terms of body size and growth parameters. Data available on T. lathami was attained between 2008 and 2010 from surveys at SEBB. A total of 278 whole otoliths of T. lathami, total length between 27 mm and 208 mm, were analyzed and compared with the only other source of otolith data, from 1975. Three blind readings were performed and assessed using traditional methods to study fish age and growth. Zero up to eight rings were found, each ring corresponding to one year in the life of an individual of this species. The von Bertalanffy growth model parameters were L∞ = 211. 90 mm and K = 0. 319 year- 1. The results of the analyses have shown similarities between 1975 and 2008 - 2010, indicating that the otolith development, the growth pattern and the age structure remained stable. T. lathami is the smallest species of Trachurus and it has the highest growth rates among them. This is probably related to the different temperatures where larvae/juvenile and adult grow, to the absence of a strong fishing pressure and to decadal population variability...|$|E
40|$|Acoustic fish {{detection}} is {{a valuable}} tool for the continuous monitoring of fish schools. However, changes in species composition or mixed multispecies situations still complicate the analysis of acoustic data. Validation of echo recordings is usually accomplished by trawling, but only at point locations. However, species proportions and size distributions in the catch can be biased because of gear selectivity and fish avoidance. In this paper, techniques involving training and testing of artificial neural networks (ANNs) are applied for the automatic recognition and classification of digital echo recordings of schools in the Southwest Atlantic. Energetic, morpho-metric, and bathymetric school descriptors were extracted from the echo-recordings as the input for the ANNs. Several pelagic and demersal fish species known to aggregate into schools were considered, including anchovy, <b>rough</b> <b>scad,</b> longtail hoki, sprat, and blue whiting. Different types of ANNs were tested. Best performances were obtained by levelling the input data (number of schools) per species. Correct classification rates up to 96 % were obtained, depending on the species, type of network, {{and the number of}} school descriptors utilized. Some of these species inhabit areas geographically distant from each other. Hence, the contribution of the school position as a descriptor was investigated. By deleting the geographical location of the schools from the ANN input data, the average performance decreased to some extent but was still satisfactory, proving the networks were able usually to recognize fish species based only on the intrinsic characteristics of the school. The results have encouraged further testing of this method as a useful tool fo...|$|E
