5|$|As {{its name}} implies, Parasaurolophus was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} closely related to Saurolophus because of its superficially similar crest. However, it was soon reassessed {{as a member of}} the lambeosaurine subfamily of hadrosaurids—Saurolophus is an hadrosaurine. It is usually interpreted as a separate offshoot of the lambeosaurines, distinct from the helmet-crested Corythosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, and Lambeosaurus. Its closest known relative appears to be Charonosaurus, a lambeosaurine with a similar skull (but no complete crest yet) from the Amur region of northeastern China, and the two may form a clade Parasaurolophini. P. cyrtocristatus, with its short, <b>rounder</b> crest, may be the most basal of the three known Parasaurolophus species, or it may represent subadult or female specimens of P. tubicen.|$|E
5|$|As well as copper, a new {{substance}} was found, extracted and exploited: this was variously called wad, black lead, plumbago or black cauke, {{and is now}} known as graphite.
