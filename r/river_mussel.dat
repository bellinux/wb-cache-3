50|$|This <b>river</b> <b>mussel</b> needs gravel river {{beds and}} swift-flowing, well-oxygenated water. The {{reduction}} in range {{seems to be}} principally due to damming and the consequential silting up of rivers below the dam and competition from zebra mussels.|$|E

5000|$|Typical {{freshwater}} species (such as many <b>river</b> <b>mussel</b> {{species in}} the family Unionidae) have a range which may consist {{of a series of}} adjacent river systems, a series of adjacent tributaries, or part of a single large river system. Large rivers and small tributary creeks typically share few species, and distribution patterns suggest large lowland rivers represent substantial barriers to the dispersal of species adapted to small upland streams. Endemism is common in some families, and species may be endemic to a single creek or spring. In contrast, some of the tiny pill clams have a nearly worldwide distribution (Burch, 1972) ...|$|E
40|$|Thick shelled <b>river</b> <b>mussel</b> Unio crassus (included in IUCN Red Data List) is a benthic, filter-feeding animal very {{susceptible}} to any changes of water chemistry. In this paper {{we report on}} the new sites of this species in the Małopolska region – an area of strong anthropogenic pressure. Physical and chemical param-eters have been compared between 8 rivers inhabited and not inhabited by the mussel. Results indicate that despite economic development of the region, it retains clear rivers; however, subtle differences in water chemistry can influence the occurrence of this endangered species...|$|E
40|$|To date, five species {{listed in}} the European Union Habitats and Species Directive {{are present in the}} Nord – Pas-de-Calais region (northern France) : the Roman snail, Helix pomatia Linnaeus, 1758; the Thick shelled <b>River</b> <b>mussel,</b> Unio crassus Philipsson, 1788; the Rhamshorn snail, Anisus vorticulus (Troschel, 1834); the Desmoulins Whorl snail, Vertigo moulinsiana (Dupuy, 1849) and the Narrow-mouth Whorl snail, Vertigo angustior Jeffreys, 1830. The giant Pearl Mussel, Margaritifera auricularia (Spengler, 1793), {{although}} cited in ancient literature, is not considered as still extant. This paper presents the state of knowledge, history, distribution, habitats and threats to these species in the Nord – Pas-de-Calais region.

40|$|Laboratory {{investigation}} {{was carried out}} on the abundance and composition of bacteria in the digestive system {{of a total of}} 35 specimens, including bivalve molluscs, i. e. swan mussel Anodonta cygnea (Linnaeus, 1758) from Lake Spėra (Širvintos district) and swollen <b>river</b> <b>mussel</b> Unio tumidus (Philipson, 1788) from the Curonian Lagoon near Juodkrantė, zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) from the Curonian Lagoon near Juodkrantė and an anostracan – Chirocephalus josephinae (Grube, 1853) from a pond in Ilčiukai village, Utena district, and in the water of related water bodies. Studies on bivalve molluscs (swan mussel and swollen <b>river</b> <b>mussel),</b> zebra mussel and an anostracan – Chirocephalus josephinae, as well as microbiological investigation of water demonstrated that the number of microorganisms in the digestive system of mollusc and anostracan species fluctuated and varied between different species and water bodies. The greatest percentage of HDB among total heterotrophic bacteria was found in the digestive system of swollen river mussels (21. 53 %) and in zebra mussels (19. 99 %) caught in the Curonian Lagoon and in the water of the lagoon (24 %). A considerably smaller percentage of HDB was detected in the digestive system of swan mussels from Lake Spėra (17. 6 %) and in the water of the lake (16. 66 %). The smallest percentage of HDB was found in the digestive system of Chirocephalus josephinae (6. 63 %) and in the water of the Ilčiukai pond (2. 72 %). According to the values of abundance of petroleum hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (HDB) and total coliform bacteria (TCFB) in the digestive system of aquatic organisms we can state that the water ecosystem of Ilčiukai pond was the least contaminated with petroleum, its products and sewage water, and the Curonian Lagoon water ecosystem was the most contaminated. Abundance of petroleum hydrocarbons degrading bacteria {{could be used as a}} bioindicator reflecting the level of ecosystem pollution petroleum and its products. DOI: [URL] </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results of}} a malacological survey of four small tributaries of the brook Javorka near Lázně Bělohrad in East Bohemia (Czech Republic). Only 15 species of aquatic molluscs (7 gastropods, 8 bivalves) were found at 31 sites during research realised in 2010, 2011 and 2012. Molluscan assemblages of all tributaries were similar and consisted of common and widespread molluscs as Galba truncatula, Radix peregra, Anodonta anatina, Pisidium subtruncatum or P. casertanum. The occurrence of endangered river pea mussel (Pisidium amnicum) was confirmed at three tributaries but only at lower parts near its inflows to the brook Javorka. The research {{was focused on the}} endangered thick-shelled <b>river</b> <b>mussel</b> (Unio crassus), and the occurrence of numerous population was confirmed at the brook Lukavecký potok. In the brook Chotečský potok a small population of this bivalve was found. Only a few specimens were found at remaining two tributaries...|$|E
40|$|This is the Species {{management}} in aquatic Habitats WRc Interim 1997 document {{produced by the}} Environment Agency in 1997. This document reports progress on R&D Project 640, which aims to provide information on species of conservation value of particular relevance to the Environment Agency, in relation to its activities affecting aquatic environments. A range of stand-alone outputs is being produced, comprising Species Action Plans, practical management guidelines for Agency staff and third parties, and various research outputs to improve the knowledge base on the status and ecological requirements of priority species. The species of conservation values are: water shrew, daubenton’s bat, Kingfisher, yellow wagtail, Grey wagtail, sand martin, reed bunting, dipper, marsh warbler, great crested new, spined loach, brook lamprey, river lamprey, sea lamprey, shining rams-horn snail, little whirlpool rams-horn snail, depressed <b>river</b> <b>mussel,</b> a freshwater pea mussel, native crayfish, and triangular club-rush. The process of species selection was altered {{during the course of}} the project by the report on biodiversity by the UK Biodiversity Steering Group (1995). Whilst still including species that were not particularly endangered but were greatly influenced by the activities of the Agency, the project addressed species on the ‘short’ and ‘middle’ priority lists of the Biodiversity report, particularly those for which the Agency had specific responsibilities...|$|E
