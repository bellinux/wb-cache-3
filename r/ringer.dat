5|$|The {{libretto}} {{was published}} in Mantua in 1607 {{to coincide with the}} premiere and incorporated Striggio's ambiguous ending. However, Monteverdi's score published in Venice in 1609 by Ricciardo Amadino shows an entirely different resolution, with Orpheus transported to the heavens through the intervention of Apollo. According to <b>Ringer,</b> Striggio's original ending was almost certainly used at the opera's premiere, but {{there is no doubt that}} Monteverdi believed the revised ending was aesthetically correct. The musicologist Nino Pirrotta argues that the Apollo ending was part of the original plan for the work, but was not staged at the premiere because the small room which hosted the event could not contain the theatrical machinery that this ending required. The Bacchantes scene was a substitution; Monteverdi's intentions were restored when this constraint was removed.|$|E
5|$|The series' {{first season}} {{was the basis}} for the 2010 live-action film, The Last Airbender, written and {{directed}} by M. Night Shyamalan. It was intended as the first of a trilogy, with each of the three films based upon one of the three television seasons, but the film's reception was overwhelmingly negative from critics and series fans alike; it had a six-percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes and received five Razzies at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture. Although the film originally shared the title of the television series, it was changed to The Last Airbender because producers feared that it would be confused with the James Cameron film Avatar. The Last Airbender stars Noah <b>Ringer</b> as Aang, Nicola Peltz as Katara, Jackson Rathbone as Sokka, Dev Patel as Zuko, and Shaun Toub as Iroh.|$|E

40|$|In the {{physiological}} study of fertilization in fish eggs, T. Yamamoto (1961) found that <b>Ringer's</b> solution {{is not only}} excellent {{for the preservation of}} ripe unfertilized eggs of medaka, but can be used as an insemination solution. According to him, the medaka eggs are activated by the penetration of spermato-zoa and undergo embryonic development in <b>Ringer's</b> solution. In the dog salmon, the ripe eggs retain their fertilizability for several hours in <b>Ringer's</b> solution {{as in the case of}} medaka but are not activated by insemination in this solution (K. Yamamoto, 1951). It is possible to assume that such a failure of activation is due to the absence of real penetration of the dog salmon egg by a spermatozoon. To examine this possibility, Kusa (1950) carried out an interesting experiment and concluded that the effective spermatozoon had actually penetrated into the egg in <b>Ringer's</b> solution. However he did not observe the behavior of spermatozoa which had penetrated such eggs. Therefore the fate of spermatozoa after penetrat-ing dog salmon eggs in <b>Ringer's</b> solution was traced cytologically in the present study. Materials and Methods The materials used in the present study were derived from matured individuals of the dog salmon, Oncorhynchus keta. Ripe eggs taken from the abdominal cavity of the females were repeatedly washed with <b>Ringer's</b> solution and were artificially inseminated in the same solution. Two minutes later, the eggs were thoroughly washed with a large amount of <b>Ringer's</b> solution to reduce the number of excess spermatozoa adhering to the egg surface. The · inseminated eggs were maintained in newly prepared <b>Ringer's</b> solution at 10 ° 0. The <b>Ringer's</b> solution used had th...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Isolated frog skin epithelia undergo marked, but {{reversible}} swelling {{when the}} external skin surface is bathed with conventional NaCI <b>Ringer's</b> {{and the internal}} surface with KC 1 <b>Ringer's</b> solutions. In 2 hours, epithelial thickness increased by over twofold. When NaCl <b>Ringer's</b> was replaced {{on both sides of}} the skin, volume returned to control levels in less than 1 hour. When sulfate, rather than chloride, was the predominant anion, exposure of the internal surface to high potassium concentrations did not evoke changes in epithelial cell volume. With both KCI and K 2 SO 4 <b>Ringer's,</b> an immediate drop in DC resistance across the skin occurred. This was followed by partial recovery. Both the immediate drop and partial recovery were unrelated to changes in volume. A slow, sustained secondary drop in resistance was observed with KCI but not K 2 SO 4 <b>Ringer's.</b> This slower drop was associated temporally with swelling. When epithelial cell swelling occurred (i. e. with KC 1 <b>Ringer's),</b> the characteristic response of the skin to vasopressin was abolished. However, with sulfate as anion, vasopressin elicited-an increase in short-circuit current and/o...|$|R

40|$|The {{membrane}} potential of frog sartorius muscle fibers in a Cl- and Na-free <b>Ringer's</b> solution when sucrose replaces NaCl {{is about the}} same as that in normal <b>Ringer's</b> solution. The K+ efflux is also about the same in the two solutions but muscles lose K and PO 4 in sucrose <b>Ringer's</b> solutions. The {{membrane potential}} in sucrose <b>Ringer's</b> solution is equal to that given by the Nernst equation for a K+ electrode, when corrections are made for the activity coefficients for K+ inside and outside the fiber. For a muscle in normal <b>Ringer's</b> solution, the measured membrane potential is within a few millivolts of EK. This finding is incompatible with a 1 : 1 coupled Na-K pump.

40|$|Studies were {{designed}} to compare the segmental analysis of sodium reabsorption along the nephron during volume expansion with either 10 % body weight <b>Ringer's</b> or 0. 6 % body weight hyperoncotic albumin. Total kidney and nephron glomerular filtration rate increased similarly with both, but urinary sodium excretion (12. 7 vs. 4. 0 μeq/min, P < 0. 001) and fractional sodium excretion (5. 0 vs. 1. 6 %, P < 0. 001) increased {{to a greater extent}} with <b>Ringer's.</b> Fractional reabsorption of sodium in the proximal tubule was diminished in both groups but to a significantly greater extent during <b>Ringer's</b> (P < 0. 005). Absolute reabsorption was inhibited only in the <b>Ringer's</b> group. Delivery of filtrate out of the proximal tubule was greater in the <b>Ringer's</b> studies, 45 vs. 37 nl/min (P < 0. 001). However, both fractional and absolute sodium delivery to the early and late distal tubule were not significantly different in the two groups. Fractional reabsorption in the collecting duct decreased from 96 % in hydropenia to 31 % during <b>Ringer's</b> but fell only slightly to 80 % in the albumin studies. Absolute collecting duct reabsorption was also greater in the albumin studies, 0. 55 vs. 0. 21 neq/min (P < 0. 001), which could totally account for the difference in urinary sodium excretion between the two groups. 22 Na recovery in the final urine after end distal microinjections was 71 % during <b>Ringer's</b> infusion and 34 % during albumin (P < 0. 001). From these data we conclude that: (a) <b>Ringer's</b> solution has a greater inhibitory effect on proximal tubular sodium reabsorption, and (b) in spite of this effect, differences in mucosal to serosal collecting duct sodium transport are primarily responsible for the greater natriuresis during <b>Ringer's</b> infusion...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The optimal {{strategy}} for fluid management during gastrointestinal surgery remains unclear. Minimizing {{the variation in}} arterial pulse pressure, which is induced by mechanical ventilation, is a potential strategy to improve postoperative outcomes. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective, randomized study with lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> solution and 6 % hydroxyethyl starch solution. METHOD: A total of 60 patients who were undergoing gastrointestinal surgery were randomized into a restrictive lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> group (n= 20), a goal-directed lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> group (n= 20) and a goal-directed hydroxyethyl starch group (n= 20). The goal-directed fluid treatment was guided by pulse pressure variation, which was recorded during surgery using a simple manual method with a Datex Ohmeda S/ 5 Monitor and minimized to 11 % or less by volume loading with either lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> solution or 6 % hydroxyethyl starch solution (130 / 0. 4). The postoperative flatus time, the length of hospital stay and the incidence of complications were recorded as endpoints. RESULTS: The goal-directed lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> group received {{the greatest amount of}} total operative fluid compared with the two other groups. The flatus time and the length of hospital stay in the goal-directed hydroxyethyl starch group were shorter than those in the goal-directed lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> group and the restrictive lactated <b>Ringer’s</b> group.
