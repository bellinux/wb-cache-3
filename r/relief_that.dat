5|$|In addition, if civil {{proceedings}} are taken against the Government, section 27 of the Government Proceedings Act bars the High Court from granting injunctions against it. In place of an injunction, the Court {{may make a}} declaration concerning the parties' rights. The Court also may not make an injunction against a government officer if the effect of doing so would be to provide <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> {{could not be obtained}} against the Government directly. Section 2(2) of the Act makes it clear that the term {{civil proceedings}} includes proceedings for judicial review.|$|E
5|$|On 12 February 2014, Channel 5 {{confirmed}} to Broadcast magazine {{that it was}} in the process of filming a similar documentary, provisionally titled Living on the Social, in which individuals and families would discuss their lives on welfare.

The Yorkshire Post reported a similar approach to residents in Bridlington in April.

5|$|The Enterprise {{attempts}} {{to rescue the}} freighter Sanction, which is trapped in a star's magnetic field. An agreement is reached to transport over {{the crew of the}} freighter, but they surprisingly send over a cargo barrel first. The Enterprise crew {{attempts to}} transport the freighter's crew, but is only successful in recovering four of them before their ship is destroyed. Two, T'Jon (Merritt Butrick) and Romas (Richard Lineback), are scruffy and unshaven, while the other two, Sobi (Judson Scott) and Langor (Kimberly Farr), are groomed and well dressed. They all show <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> the barrel made it over, and little remorse for the lost ship and crewmen. Both groups start to fight over the ownership of the barrel, and are escorted to the observation lounge under guard.|$|E
5|$|The Philadelphia Mint {{received}} the models from Ortmayer. On May 23 its superintendent, Edwin Dressel, sent O'Reilly a memorandum from Chief Engraver John R. Sinnock, {{stating that the}} sculptor's models were in too high relief, and suggesting that Ortmayer come to the mint to discuss the matter. A letter from O'Reilly to Melish on June 18 reports that after some modification, Sinnock wrote that the coin was at the very limit of high <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> the mint could coin, and that dies for the Cincinnati piece {{were expected to be}} tested by coining trial strikes in early July.|$|E
5|$|Those {{who engage}} in self-harm face the {{contradictory}} reality of harming themselves {{while at the same}} time obtaining relief from this act. It may even be hard for some to actually initiate cutting, but they often do because they know the <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> will follow. For some self-harmers this relief is primarily psychological while for others this feeling of relief comes from the beta endorphins released in the brain. Endorphins are endogenous opioids that are released in response to physical injury, act as natural painkillers, and induce pleasant feelings and would act to reduce tension and emotional distress. Many self-harmers report feeling very little to no pain while self-harming and, for some, deliberate self-harm may become a means of seeking pleasure.|$|E

5|$|English naval {{power was}} vital to Edward I's {{successful}} campaigns in Scotland from 1296, using largely merchant ships from England, Ireland {{and his allies}} in the Islands to transport and supply his armies. Part {{of the reason for}} Robert I's success was his ability to call on naval forces from the Islands. As a result of the expulsion of the Flemings from England in 1303, he gained the support of a major naval power in the North Sea. The development of naval power allowed Robert to successfully defeat English attempts to capture him in the Highlands and Islands and to blockade major English controlled fortresses at Perth and Stirling, the last forcing Edward II to attempt the <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> resulted at English defeat at Bannockburn in 1314. Scottish naval forces allowed invasions of the Isle of Man in 1313 and 1317 and Ireland in 1315. They were also crucial in the blockade of Berwick, which led to its fall in 1318.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Maryland had a {{new head}} coach, Ron Vanderlinden, and he {{immediately}} saw that Navy was a natural rival for his team, but {{was unaware of the}} past history. Vanderlinden attempted to renew the game, {{but it was not until}} after his <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> the idea materialized. In 2001, Ralph Friedgen was hired as his successor and spearheaded efforts to reinvigorate the team's old rivalries, including that against Navy. Friedgen, who played for Maryland as an offensive guard, was at the 1964 game as a recruit. He had also coached for nine years as Georgia Tech's offensive coordinator, and he harbored nostalgic feelings for a rivalry with the passion of Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate. Friedgen stated that, in addition to the rivalries with West Virginia and Virginia, a renewed in-state series would be even more meaningful. In 2002, the two schools agreed to meet for the first Crab Bowl Classic in forty years, scheduled for 2005.|$|E

5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate <b>relief</b> <b>that</b> comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who has difficulty pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E

25|$|A {{year later}} the {{songwriter}} Sammy Cahn and four music publishers, {{unhappy with the}} absence of a royalties provision in the Athens agreement, filed a class action copyright infringement suit against Sony.

The suit brought Sony to heel. In July 1991, Sony, as part of larger agreement between the recording industry and consumer electronics makers, agreed to support legislation creating a royalty scheme for digital media. In exchange, Cahn and the publishers agreed to drop the suit.|$|E
25|$|The burial chamber was a vault {{constructed}} of four courses of well-dressed granite. It had one opening, which was sealed with a 3.5 ton block after the burial.
