40|$|Context The healthy ageing {{assumptions}} {{may lead}} to substantial changes in paths of aggregate healthcare expenditures, notably catastrophic expenditures {{of people at the}} end of the life. But clear assessments of involved amounts are not available when we specifically consider ambulatory care (as drug expenditures) generally offered to chronically-ill people who can remain in this health-status for a long time onward. The Government and Social Security need tools to predict the future cost of health in particular drugs expenditures taking account epidemiological changes on future. This study estimates the evolution in reimbursable outpatient drug expenditures, attributable to age structure and chronic conditions changes, of the French population up to 2029. * Methods Matched data from both the 2004 Health and Social Protection Survey (carried out by IRDES) and from French Social Security databases were used in this study. We estimate the effects of epidemiological and life expectancy changes on French health expenditures until 2029 by applying a markovian microsimulation model from a nationally representative database. The originality of these simulations holds in using an aggregate indicator of morbidity-mortality, capturing vital risk and making it possible to adapt the quantification of life expectancies by taking into account the presence of severe chronic pathologies. Three epidemiological scenarios were constructed. * Findings We forecast future national drugs expenditures, under different epidemiological scenarios of chronic morbidity: Trend scenario, healthy ageing scenario and medical progress scenario. For the population aged 25 +, results predict an increase in <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drug</b> expenditures of between 1. 1 % and 1. 8 % (annual growth rate), attributable solely to the ageing population and changes in health status. * Conclusion The small difference between the healthy ageing scenario (1. 1 %) and the simple continuation of trends scenario (1. 4 %) indicates that, contrary to expectations, reduced chronic conditions of future cohorts does not imply a large saving in terms of drug expenditures...|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} be taken in charge by health insurance, care and {{products}} must meet two conditions: being provided by a public or private practitioner duly authorized to exercise, and being included on the list of <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs</b> and products. Health insurance operate on the basis of tariffs set by convention or authority. Health insurance does not support all the expenses within the rates used to calculate benefits. In principle, the insured is required to advance the expenses, social security then reimbursing the insured.

30|$|To {{ensure the}} {{viability}} of the AMO, the informative mission on the drug pricing in Morocco suggests that the refund shall be {{made on the basis of}} a Reference Price. A drug whose price is higher than the reference price by more than 30 % should not be reimbursed. This selective reimbursement will end the uncontrolled proliferation of GDs and exclude immediately from refund all the expensive medications with a generic on the market. If these measures are accompanied by an information campaign targeting prescribers, so that patients are not harmed, they should result in the promotion of GDs and in reductions of more than 40 % of the price of these drugs. The mission suggests also that <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs</b> by AMO should have a visible distinctive label on their packaging to guide the prescribers and patients.|$|R
40|$|China's recent {{healthcare}} reforms aim {{to provide}} fair and affordable {{health services for}} its huge population. In this paper, we investigate the association between China's health insurance and out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare expenditure. We further explore the heterogeneity in this association. Using data of 32, 387 middle-aged and elderly individuals drawn from the 2011 and 2013 waves of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), we report five findings. First, having health insurance {{increases the likelihood of}} utilizing healthcare and reduces inpatient OOP expenditure. Second, healthcare benefits are distributed unevenly: while low- and medium-income individuals are the main beneficiaries with reduced OOP expenditure, those faced with very high medical bills are still at risk, owing to limited and shallow coverage in certain aspects. Third, rural migrants hardly benefit from having health insurance, suggesting that institutional barriers are still in place. Fourth, health insurance does not increase patient visits to primary care facilities; hospitals are still the main provider of healthcare. Nonetheless, {{there is some evidence that}} patients shift from higher-tier to lower-tier hospitals. Last, OOP spending on pharmaceuticals is reduced for inpatient care but not for outpatient care, suggesting that people rely on inpatient care to obtain <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs,</b> putting further pressure on the already overcrowded hospitals. Our findings suggest that China's health insurance system has been effective in boosting healthcare utilization and lowering OOP hospitalization expenditure, but there still remain challenges due to the less generous rural scheme, shallow outpatient care coverage, lack of insurance portability, and an underdeveloped primary healthcare system...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on {{governance}} of the pharmaceutical sector in Israel. It traces {{the relationships between the}} state, industry, and sick funds from before the establishment of National Health Insurance (NHI) in 1995 to the beginning of this decade, in particular as they have grappled with the challenge of making national formulary decisions in a rational manner. Subsequent to the introduction of NHI there have been shifts in the modes and mix of governance. This research shows empirically that a relatively complex mix of hierarchical and network modes of governance can be successfully established {{over an extended period of}} time when flexibility is maintained through the implementation process. The system for defining and updating a standard basket of health services has coped well with the challenge of managing a range of difficult and potentially volatile stakeholder relationships in the pharmaceutical sector and of distancing ministers from controversies of funding and listing decisions. Government has succeeded in containing drug costs whilst still maintaining a basket of <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs</b> that, from an international perspective, is comprehensive and technologically advanced. On the other hand, network arrangements appear to have delayed the introduction of suitable accountability relationships and hindered their development. The state has traditionally played an intermediary role between unavoidable corporate interests of industry and sick funds, with little transparency and to the detriment of more pluralistic access to decision making. Governance arrangements in Israel appear to limit the potential and incentive of the state and the sick funds to realize their potential countervailing powers in subsidy and pricing decisions...|$|R
40|$|Substandard {{drugs are}} an issue ofconcern. Estimates show that coun-terfeit drugs made up 10 % {{of the global}} drug supply in 2003. 1 Over 2. 5 million {{counterfeit}} drugs were seized at the Eu-ropean Union’s borders in 2007. 2 Euro-pean Union estimates show {{that in the last}} 5 years, 27 cases of counterfeit drugs were found in the legal supply chain and 170 cases in the illegal supply chain. 3 Furthermore, UK and US studies have reported dispensing error rates of up to 24 % in community pharmacy and have shown that patients run the risk of re-ceiving recalled or expired drugs at the point of dispensing. 4 Counterfeit, re-called, and expired drugs pose a threat to patient health and safety because of ther-apeutic inadequacy and the emergence of resistance or toxicity; they also raise concerns over potential litigation. 5 AegateProtect is a patient safety com-munications service that is based on mass serialization technology (a method of assigning a unique number to each drug pack) and is linked to patient medi-cation records. The service verifies the authenticity of a drug in real time and passes on safety or regulatory informa-tion before the community pharmacist dispenses the item to the patient. Belgium and Greece pio-neered this authentication service in 2006 and 2007, re-spectively, because all <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs</b> display a unique serialized number and pharmacies have the necessary in-formation technology systems in place to run the service. Aegate carried out a pilot study in over 40 pharmacies in the state of New York, demonstrating that the service is ap-plicable across different environments. The authentication service may be used by pharmaceutical companies, regula-tors, pharmacy associations, buying groups, and pharmacy chains...|$|R
40|$|Pharmaceutical {{policy in}} Italy has been {{reshaped}} {{as a result}} of the 1993 - 4 crisis in which it was revealed that pharmaceutical companies, policy makers and top Department of Health officers had constructed an illegal system to set prices. Following this crisis, the rise of technical competency and leadership in the Italian Department of Health and, since 2000, in the Drug Regulatory Agency (Agenzia Italiana del Farmaco; AIFA) has achieved major improvements in many aspects of Italian pharmaceutical policy. These improvements have included increased transparency of decision making, the use of evidence-based medicine principles for reimbursement and pricing, and the use of generic drugs to lower prices. As a result of these changes, pharmaceutical expenditure has been controlled and equity has improved, mainly because co-payments have been reduced, thus reducing private expenditure on <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs.</b> However, a short-term approach to cost containment has prevailed, and Italian pharmaceutical policy has neglected industrial parameters. Hence, the trend in pharmaceutical expenditure has been erratic, and Italy has not favoured localization of research and development and production in its territory. The dominant issue of Italian health policy in recent years has been devolution of powers to regions, the intermediate tier of the Italian State. Overall, devolution has increased regional accountability on healthcare spending. However, regions react to enhanced freedom in different ways, reflecting their institutional capacity and competencies. This process has also affected pharmaceutical policy, more than in other decentralized healthcare systems (such as Germany and Spain). Such a situation is causing increasing regional variations and geographical equity concerns. In addition, the regional level appears rather inadequate to promote an industrial perspective unless it is supported by national initiatives.

40|$|Background: The {{aim was to}} {{determine}} distribution and trends in the outpatient utilization of antipsychotics to evaluate the rationality of antipsychotic drug prescribing during the ten year period. Subjects and methods: The epidemiological method of descriptive and analytical observation was used. Data on drug utilization from Zagreb Municipal Pharmacy were {{used to calculate the}} number of defined daily doses (DDD) and DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (DDD/TID) using the World Health Organization Anatomical-Therapeutic-Chemical methodology. The ratio of typical versus atypical antipsychotics served as an indicator on assessing the rationality of the utilization. Data on the use of anticholinergics in the treatment of neuroleptic side effects were also included. Results: Outpatient utilization of antipsychotics showed a declining pattern from 14. 17 in 2001 to 8. 42 DDD/TID in 2010. The utilization of atypical antipsychotics increased by 60 % (from 3. 68 to 5. 89 DDD/TID), while the utilization of typical antipsychotics decreased by 76 % (from 10. 49 to 2. 53 DDD/TID). The drugs showing the largest increase were olanzapine (from 1. 21 to 2. 78 DDD/TID) and quetiapine (from 0 to 0. 68 DDD/TID). The typical/atypical antipsychotic ratio changed from 1 : 0. 4 in 2001 to 1 : 2. 3 in 2010. A 2. 3 -fold decrease was recorded in the utilization of anticholinergics (from 2. 05 to 0. 91 DDD/TID). Conclusions: Total consumption of neuroleptics significantly decreased. A decrease was also recorded in the utilization of anticholinergics. Study results pointed to two favorable features, i. e. low use of typical antipsychotics and the ratio of typical and atypical antipsychotics. Implementation of the new clinical guidelines for nervous system disorders and updating of the list of <b>reimbursable</b> <b>drugs</b> with the addition of new ones contributed to the observed improvement in the prescribing patterns during the study period. Using the WHO ATC/DDD methodology and rationality indicators in the assessment of trends in the outpatient utilization of psychopharmaceuticals over a ten-year period proved efficient in the evaluation of prescribing rationality...|$|R
40|$|Background. Antisecretory {{drugs for}} acid-related {{diseases}} are the second <b>reimbursable</b> group of <b>drugs</b> in the Italian Healthcare System. To control health costs after {{the launching of}} generic lansoprazole in the market (early 2006), several Italian Regional Health Authorities have introduced rules to favour the prescription of less costly generic drugs. Aim. To evaluate the prescription of Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) from Jan 2005 to Dec 2007 in a primary care setting of South Italy. Methods. Analysis has been performed on a database of 100 medical practitioners that have managed an average of 144. 000 inhabitants during the observation period. Evaluations performed are the following: 1) PPI prescription (total and separately for Lansoprazole - L; Esomeprazole - E; Pantoprazole - P; Rabeprazole - R; and Omeprazole - O); 2) prevalence of the reimbursement purpose (Gastroprotection - G; Acid- Related Disease - ARD); 3) prevalence of patients with ARD categorized {{on the basis of}} PPI prescriptions as drugs box/year (1 - 3 short treatment - ST; 4 - 11 long treatment - LT; > 12 very long treatment - VLT). Data were expressed as Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR). Results. Patients with PPI prescriptions (at least one prescription) in the study population were 7188 (5. 52 %), 8972 (6. 62 %) and 10437 (7. 40 %) in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. Total growth of PPI prescription in the three years expressed as CAGR was 16 %, whereas the growth for each molecule was: L + 66 %; E + 9 %; P + 8; R + 4 %; O - 10 %. The reimbursement purpose was significantly higher for G (CAGR + 44 %) than for ARD (CAGR + 8 %; p< 0. 01). In the three years we found an increase of ARD patients with ST (2005 : 3687; 2006 : 4165; 2007 : 4522), LT (2599, 2995, 3231) and VLT (2120, 2944, 3550) with a significant highest CAGR for VLT patients (ST + 7. 0 %; LT + 7. 5 % and VLT + 18. 7 %; p< 0. 01). Analysis of each PPI prescription showed a highest CAGR for L in VLT patients (78 %), while the lowest one was for O in VLT patients (- 14 %). Conclusion. The launching in the market of generic PPIs has unexpectedly increased the prescription of whole drug class during the period 2005 - 2007. This increase appears prevalently related to gastroprotection purpose and to the use of generic lansoprazole. In the three years under examination, we observed a marked increase in a very long duration PPI treatment for acid related diseases that caused a relevant resource consumption. Our data suggest that the appropriateness of PPI prescription after generic PPI introduction should be carefully monitored to distinguish between cost-effective from cost-ineffective PPI treatment...|$|R
