40|$|The <b>RET</b> {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} has {{a critical role in}} kidney organogenesis and the development of the enteric nervous system. Two major isoforms, <b>RET</b> 9 and <b>RET</b> 51, differ in the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal tail as a result of alternative splicing. To determine the roles of these isoforms in vivo, we used targeted mutagenesis to generate mice that express either <b>RET</b> 9 or <b>RET</b> 51. Monoisoformic <b>RET</b> 9 mice, which lack <b>RET</b> 51, are viable and appear normal. In contrast, monoisoformic <b>RET</b> 51 animals, which lack <b>RET</b> 9, have kidney hypodysplasia and lack enteric ganglia from the colon.

40|$|The {{receptor}} {{tyrosine kinase}} <b>Ret</b> plays {{a critical role in}} the development of the mammalian excretory and enteric nervous systems. Differential splicing of the primary <b>Ret</b> transcript results in the generation of two main isoforms, <b>Ret</b> 9 and <b>Ret</b> 51, whose C-terminal amino acid tails diverge after tyrosine (Y) 1062. Monoisoformic mice expressing only <b>Ret</b> 9 develop normally and are healthy and fertile. In contrast, animals expressing only <b>Ret</b> 51 have aganglionosis of the distal gut and hypoplastic kidneys. By generating monoisoformic mice in which Y 1062 of <b>Ret</b> 9 has been mutated to phenylalanine, we demonstrate that this amino acid has a critical role in <b>Ret</b> 9 signaling that is necessary for the development of the kidneys and the enteric nervous system. These findings argue that the distinct activities of <b>Ret</b> 9 and <b>Ret</b> 51 result from the differential regulation of Y 1062 by C-terminal flanking sequences. However, a mutation which places Y 1062 of <b>Ret</b> 51 in a <b>Ret</b> 9 context improves only marginally the ability of <b>Ret</b> 51 to support renal and enteric nervous system development. Finally, monoisoformic mice expressing a variant of <b>Ret</b> 9 in which a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif was mutated develop normally and are healthy.

50|$|The {{most widely}} practiced method of <b>retting,</b> called water <b>retting,</b> is {{performed}} by submerging bundles of stalks in water.

40|$|<b>RET</b> gene {{is crucial}} for the {{development}} of enteric nervous system, and dys-regulation of <b>RET</b> expression causes Hirschsprung disease.

The mechanisms by which HOXB 5 regulate <b>RET</b> transcription are unclear. Thus, unraveling the regulatory mechanisms of HOXB 5 on <b>RET</b> transcription could lead {{to a better understanding of}} the etiology of Hirschsprung disease. In this study, we identified and confirmed HOXB 5 binding to the multi-species conserved sequence (MCS+ 9. 7) in the first intron of the <b>RET</b> gene. We developed a <b>RET</b> mini-gene reporter system, and showed that MCS+ 9. 7 enhanced HOXB 5 trans-activation from <b>RET</b> promoter in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells and in chick embryos. The deletion of HOXB 5 binding site interfered with HOXB 5 trans-activation. Furthermore, transfection of HOXB 5 induced endogenous <b>RET</b> transcription, enhanced the co-precipitation of TATA-box binding protein with the transcription start site of <b>RET,</b> and induced histone H 3 K 4 trimethylation in chromatin regions upstream and downstream of <b>RET</b> transcription start site. In conclusion, (i) HOXB 5 physically interacted with MCS+ 9. 7 and enhanced <b>RET</b> transcription, (ii) HOXB 5 altered chromatin conformation and histone modification of <b>RET</b> locus, which could facilitate the formation of transcription complex, and enhance <b>RET</b> transcription, (iii) expression of <b>RET</b> was mediated by a complex regulatory network of transcription factors functioning in a synergistic, additive and/or independent manners.

40|$|The {{product of}} the <b>RET</b> {{proto-oncogene}} is a protein belonging to the receptor-like tyrosine kinase superfamily. <b>RET</b> is expressed in several neural crest-derived cell lineages and has been implicated in the correct development of the peripheral nervous system.

40|$|The glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) {{are critical for}} nervous system development and maintenance. GFLs promote survival and growth via activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) <b>Ret.</b> In sympathetic neurons, the duration of <b>Ret</b> signaling is governed by how rapidly <b>Ret</b> is degraded after its activation. In an effort to elucidate mechanisms that control the half-life of <b>Ret,</b> we have identified two novel <b>Ret</b> interactors, CD 2 -associated protein (CD 2 AP) and Cbl- 3. CD 2 AP, an adaptor molecule involved in the internalization of ubiquitinated RTKs, is associated with <b>Ret</b> under basal, unstimulated conditions in neurons. After <b>Ret</b> activation by GDNF, CD 2 AP dissociates. Similarly, the E 3 -ligase Cbl- 3 interacts with unphosphorylated <b>Ret</b> and dissociates from <b>Ret</b> after <b>Ret</b> activation. In contrast to their dissociation from autophosphorylated <b>Ret,</b> an interaction between CD 2 AP and Cbl- 3 is induced by GDNF stimulation of sympathetic neurons, suggesting that CD 2 AP and Cbl- 3 dissociate from <b>Ret</b> as a complex. In neurons, the overexpression of CD 2 AP enhances the degradation of <b>Ret</b> and inhibits GDNF-dependent survival, and gene silencing of CD 2 AP blocks <b>Ret</b> degradation and promotes GDNF-mediated survival. Surprisingly, Cbl- 3 overexpression dramatically stabilizes activated <b>Ret</b> and enhances neuronal survival, even though Cbl-family E 3 ligases normally function to trigger RTK downregulation. In combination with CD 2 AP, however, Cbl- 3 promotes <b>Ret</b> degradation rapidly and almost completely blocks survival promotion by GDNF, suggesting that Cbl- 3 acts as a switch that is triggered by CD 2 AP and oscillates between inhibition and promotion of <b>Ret</b> degradation. Consistent with the hypothesis, Cbl- 3 silencing in neurons only inhibited <b>Ret</b> degradation and enhanced neuronal survival in combination with CD 2 A...|$|R

50|$|Several {{methods are}} used for <b>retting</b> flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the <b>retting</b> is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are {{standing}} out from the stalks.

It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of <b>retting</b> also produces quite an odor. Stream <b>retting</b> is similar to pool <b>retting,</b> but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond <b>retting,</b> but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream <b>retting</b> were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.|$|E

Recent genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation-based studies have identified 10 putative E 2 receptor-alpha (ESR 1) and RA receptor alpha-binding sites at the <b>RET</b> locus, of which we demonstrate only two (<b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8) display significant E 2 regulatory response when assayed independently in MCF- 7 breast cancer cells. We demonstrate that endogenous <b>RET</b> expression and <b>RET</b> 249. 8 regulatory activity are cooperatively regulated by E 2 and RA in breast cancer cells. We identify key sequences that are required for <b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8 E 2 responsiveness, including motifs known to be bound by ESR 1, FOXA 1 and TFAP 2 C. We also report that both <b>RET</b> 249. 8 regulatory activity and endogenous <b>RET</b> expression are completely dependent on ESR 1 for their (E 2) -induction and that ESR 1 is sufficient to mediate the E 2 -induced enhancer activity of <b>RET</b> 249. 8 and <b>RET</b> 132. 8.
