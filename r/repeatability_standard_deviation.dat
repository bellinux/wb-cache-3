Batches of two reference materials. water and sand. both spiked with radionuclides (Ba- 133, Cs- 134, Cs- 137, K- 40, Co- 57 and Co- 60) were used in an intra- and interlaboratory test. For the water and sand, 10 and 9 laboratories, respectively, agreed to analyse three samples of each reference material strictly according to the pre-normative protocol. The interlaboratory test programme showed that for both reference materials the values for the reproducibility standard deviation were 1. 5 - 6 times larger than those for the <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation.</b> This extra variation is caused by the parameter 'laboratory. For both reference materials the <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> was found in the range 0. 9 - 2. 0 % of the mean activity concentration: the reproducibility standard deviation ranged from 2. 5 - 6. 0 %. Bias of the test method was found for Cs- 134 (- 6. 8 %) and Ba- 133 (- 2. 3 %) in case of the spiked water and for Cs- 134 (- 7. 8 %) in case of the spiked sand. This bias is attributed to no or insufficient correction for coincidence summing. In general, the interlaboratory test showed satisfactory agreement between laboratories, In the light of regulations on radioactivity in materials it is concluded that for measurement of this activity the Dutch protocol may serve as a blueprint for an (European Community) protocol.

40|$|Precision {{criteria}} for the quantification of metals in acetic acid 3 % and acetic acid 4 % migration solutions for different analytical techniques were calculated and are presented in this report. They were derived from two interlaboratory comparisons (ILC 03 / 04 2014) data, including <b>repeatability</b> and reproducibility <b>standard</b> <b>deviations.</b> Three groups of analytical techniques were identified from the ILCs: Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma Optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) and atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS).

Methods: Cervical transfer impedance was measured at 14 frequencies between 76 and 625 000 Hz from 11 pregnant subjects at term. Repeated measurements were taken with two probes (3 mm and 12 mm diameter) applied softly (approximately 0. 7 Newton of force), and firmly (approximately 2. 2 Newton) {{to the surface of}} the cervix by two observers.

40|$|In Europe, dynamic olfactometry, as {{described}} by the European standard EN 13725, has become the preferred method for evaluating odor emissions emanating from industrial and agricultural sources. Key elements of this standard are the quality criteria for trueness and precision (repeatability). Both are linked to standard values of n-butanol in nitrogen. It is assumed in this standard that whenever a laboratory complies with the overall sensory quality criteria for n-butanol, the quality level is transferable to other, environmental, odors. Although olfactometry is well established, little {{has been done to}} investigate inter laboratory variance (reproducibility). Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} estimate the reproducibility of odor laboratories complying with EN 13725 as well as to investigate the transferability of n-butanol quality criteria to other odorants. Based upon the statistical analysis of 412 odor measurements on 33 sources, distributed in 10 proficiency tests, it was established that laboratory, panel and panel session are components of variance that significantly differ between n-butanol and other odorants (a = 0. 05). This finding does not support the transferability of the quality criteria, as determined on n-butanol, to other odorants and as such is a cause for reconsideration of the present single reference odorant as laid down in EN 13725. In case of non-butanol odorants, <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (sr) and reproducibility standard deviation (sR) were calculated to be 0. 108 and 0. 282 respectively (log base- 10). The latter implies that the difference between two consecutive single measurements, performed on the same testing material by two or more laboratories under reproducibility conditions, will not be larger than a factor 6. 3 in 95 % of cases. As far as n-butanol odorants are concerned, it was found that the present <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> (sr = 0. 108) compares favorably to that of EN 13725 (sr = 0. 172).

However, ambulatory HRV measurements obtained through use of these systems have not previously been validated against standard clinical measurements such as Holter recordings. The objective {{of this study was}} to validate HRV obtained using a commonly used system, Actiheart, during occupational and leisure-time activities. Method Full-day ambulatory electrocardiography (ECG) signals were recorded from 8 females simultaneously using Actiheart and Holter recorders, and signals were processed to RR-interval time series. Segments of 5 -minute duration were sampled every 30 minutes, and spectral components of the heart rate variability were calculated. Actiheart and Holter values were compared using Deming regression analysis and Bland-Altman plots. Results In total, 489 segments were available with an HRV value from both Actiheart and Holter recordings after filtering out segments with > 10 % interpolated beats. No systematic differences between Actiheart and Holter HRV were found. The random deviations between Actiheart and Holter were comparable to the <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> between consecutive Holter measurements.

A laboratory biofilm reactor system, called the CDC biofilm reactor (CBR) system, has been devised for growing biofilms under moderate to high fluid shear stress. The reactor incorporates 24 removable biofilm growth surfaces (coupons) for sampling and analysing the biofilm. Following preliminary experiments to verify the utility of the CBR system for growing biofilms of several clinically relevant organisms, a standard operating procedure for growing a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm was created.

The accelerated soiling and weathering method was applied four times by each laboratory to replicate coupons of 12 products representing a wide variety of roofing categories (single-ply membrane, factory-applied coating (on metal), bare metal, field-applied coating, asphalt shingle, modified-bitumen cap sheet, clay tile, and concrete tile). Participants reported initial and laboratory-aged values of solar reflectance and thermal emittance. Measured solar reflectances were consistent within and across eight of the nine participating laboratories. Measured thermal emittances reported by six participants exhibited comparable consistency.

40|$|A good primary {{stability}} of cementless femoral stems {{is essential for}} the long-term success of total hip arthroplasty. Experimental measurement of implant micromotion with linear variable differential transformers is commonly used to assess implant primary stability in pre-clinical testing. But these measurements are often limited to a few distinct points at the interface. New techniques based on micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) have recently been introduced, such as Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) or markers-based approaches. DVC is however limited to measurement around non-metallic implants due to metal-induced imaging artifacts, and markers-based techniques are confined to {{a small portion of the}} implant. In this paper, we present a technique based on micro-CT imaging and radiopaque markers to provide the first full-field micromotion measurement at the entire bone-implant interface of a cementless femoral stem implanted in a cadaveric femur. Micromotion was measured during compression and torsion. Over 300 simultaneous measurement points were obtained. Micromotion amplitude ranged from 0 to 24 µm in compression and from 0 to 49 µm in torsion. Peak micromotion was distal in compression and proximal in torsion. The technique bias was 5. 1 µm and its <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> was 4 µm. The method was thus highly reliable and compared well with results obtained with linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) reported in the literature.

Possible applications include pre-clinical testing of implants and validation of patient-specific models for pre-operative planning...|$|E

The accurate measurement of vitamin D in milk is necessary to provide adequate supplementation advice for risk groups and to monitor regulatory compliance. Currently used liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods are capable of measuring only four analogues of vitamin D in unfortified milk. We report here an accurate quantitative analytical method for eight analogues of vitamin D: Vitamin D 2 and D 3 (D 2 and D 3), 25 -hydroxy D 2 and D 3, 24, 25 -dihydroxy D 2 and D 3, and 1, 25 -dihydroxyD 2 and D 3. In this study, we compared saponification and protein precipitation for the extraction of vitamin D from milk and found the latter to be more effective. We also optimised the pre-column derivatisation using 4 -phenyl-l, 2, 4 -triazoline- 3, 5 -dione (PTAD), to achieve the highest sensitivity and accuracy for all major vitamin D forms in milk. Chromatography was optimised to reduce matrix effects such as ion-suppression, and the matrix effects were eliminated using co-eluting stable isotope labelled internal standards for the calibration of each analogue. The analogues, 25 -hydroxyD 3 (25 (OH) D 3) and its epimer (3 -epi- 25 (OH) D 3) were chromatographically resolved, to prevent over-estimation of 25 (OH) D 3.

The optimized method provided good sensitivity (limits of quantitation 1. 2 – 2. 6 ng), <b>repeatability</b> (relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 2 – 9 %), and reproducibility (relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> 10 – 17 %). Passive sampling by means of polar organic chemical integrative samplers was applied to monitor river waters used as supply sources for drinking water treatment plants in the Liguria region of Italy. The analytes showed a different distribution at the three sites considered; bisphenol A {{proved to be the}} most abundant, ranging from 185 to 459 ng per sampler...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} whether {{the analysis of}} stable isotope ratios D/H and 13 C/ 12 C in ethanol and acetic acid and of 18 O/ 16 O in water {{can be applied to}} the ingredients of “aceto balsamico di Modena IGP” (ABM) to evaluate their authenticity. We found that impurities in the extraction solution do not affect the 13 C/ 12 C of acetic acid and the D/H values of acetic acid are not affected under a composite NMR experiment. The <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of <b>repeatability</b> and <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of reproducibility are comparable in wine vinegar and ABM and generally lower than those quoted in the official methods. This means that the validation parameters quoted in the official methods can also be applied to the ingredients of ABM. In addition, we found no changes in the isotopic values from wine to vinegar and to ABM, and from the original must to the ABM must, providing experimental evidence that reference data from wine databanks can also be used to evaluate the authenticity of vinegar and AB...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The aim of {{this study}} is to analyze {{possible}} random and systematic measurement errors and to detect methodological limits of the previously established method. Findings To examine the distribution of random errors (<b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation)</b> of the detection procedure, collective samples were taken from two uncontaminated rooms using a sampling vacuum cleaner, and 10 sub-samples each were examined with 3 parallel cultivation plates (DG 18). In this two collective samples of new dust, the total counts of Aspergillus spp. varied moderately by 25 and 29 % (both 9 cfu per plate). At an average of 28 cfu/plate, the total number varied only by 13 %. For the evaluation of the influence of old dust, old and fresh dust samples were examined. In both cases with old dust, the old dust influenced the results indicating false positive results, where hidden moist was indicated but was not present. To quantify the influence of sand and sieving, 13 sites were sampled in parallel using the 63 -μm- and total dust collection approaches. Sieving to 63 -μm resulted in a more then 10 -fold enrichment, due to the different quantity of inert sand in each total dust sample. Conclusion The major errors during the quantitative evaluation from house dust samples for mould fungi as reference values for assessment resulted from missing filtration, contamination with old dust and the massive influence of soil. If the assessment is guided by indicator genera, the percentage standard deviation lies in a moderate range. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{last few}} years have brought {{a vast amount of}} {{information}} about mycotoxin inactivation agents (mycotoxin binders) which are applied with the aim to reduce the toxic effects of mycotoxins in animals. The influence of the addition of mycotoxin binders to animal feed on the analytical performance of the methods for the determination of mycotoxins was studied and the results are presented in this report. Standardised methods already available or currently under consideration at the European Standardization Committee (CEN) have been applied for the analysis of mycotoxins in feed materials. Samples of 20 commercial mycotoxin inactivation agents were collected from various companies. The following mycotoxins were included in the study: aflatoxin B 1, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, fumonisins B 1 + B 2, T 2 and HT 2 toxins. Naturally contaminated or spiked feed materials and the maximum recommended amounts of the mycotoxin detoxifying agents were used in the experiments. A binder (or binders combined in a group) was mixed with feed material containing the corresponding mycotoxin, and the feed material with and without binder was analysed using the appropriate method. For data evaluation, the obtained mean values were compared by Student¿s t test (independent two-sample t test with unequal sample sizes and equal variance). The <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of each method based on collaborative trial data was used as an estimate of method variability. No significant differences (p = 0. 05) in mycotoxin levels between binder free material and the material containing different binders have been found under the applied conditions. JRC.

40|$|Recently, {{the use of}} {{substances}} that can suppress or reduce absorption, promote the excretion of mycotoxins or modify their mode of action in feed, so-called mycotoxin binders, has been officially allowed in the European Union as technological feed additives. The influence of the addition of mycotoxin binders to animal feed on the analytical performance of the official methods for the determination of mycotoxins was studied {{and the results are}} presented. Where possible standardised methods for analysis were applied. Samples of 20 commercial mycotoxin binders were collected from various companies. The following mycotoxins were included in the study: aflatoxin B 1, deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, ochratoxin A, fumonisins B 1 and B 2, T- 2 and HT- 2 toxins. A binder (or binders combined in a group) was mixed with feed material containing the mycotoxin, and the feed material was analysed. For data evaluation, the mean values were compared by Student’s t-test (an independent two-sample t-test with unequal sample sizes and equal variance). The <b>repeatability</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> of each method was used as an estimate of method variability. No significant differences (p¼ 0. 05) in mycotoxin levels between binder-free material and the material containing different binders were found. Further, the possible effects of binder addition in combination with processing (pelletising) on the amount of aflatoxin B 1 determined in feed were studied. Three commercial mycotoxin binders containing hydrated sodium calcium aluminosilicate (HSCAS) as the main component were used in these experiments. Feed samples with and without mycotoxin binders were pelletised with and without steam treatment. After pelletising, materials were analysed for AFB 1. Only the combination pelletising and a mixture of binders added at a total level of 1. 2 % had a significant effect (41 % reduction) on the amount of AFB 1 determined. JRC.

40|$|A {{method for}} the {{simultaneous}} analysis of nucleosides and nucleotides in infant formula using reversed-phase liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry is described. This approach is advantageous for compliance testing of infant formula over other LC-MS methods {{in which only}} nucleotides or nucleosides are measured. Following sample dissolution, protein was removed by centrifugal ultrafiltration. Chromatographic analyses were performed using a C 18 stationary phase and gradient elution of an ammonium acetate/bicarbonate buffer, mass spectrometric detection and quantitation by a stable isotope-labelled internal standard technique. A single laboratory validation was performed, with spike recoveries of 80. 1 – 112. 9 % and <b>repeatability</b> relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> of 1. 9 – 7. 2 %. Accuracy as bias was demonstrated against reference values for NIST 1849 a certified reference material.

40|$|Pressurised liquid {{extraction}} (PLE) {{represents a}} powerful technique {{which can be}} conveniently used for rapid extraction of mineral oil saturated (MOSH) and aromatic hydrocarbons (MOAH) from dry foods with a low fat content, such as semolina pasta, rice, and other cereals. Two different PLE methods, one for rapid determination of superficial contamination mainly from the packaging, the other for efficient extraction of total contamination from different sources, have been developed and optimised. The two methods presented good performance characteristics in terms of <b>repeatability</b> (relative <b>standard</b> <b>deviation</b> lower than 5 %) and recoveries (higher than 95 %). To show their potentiality, the two methods have been applied in combination on semolina pasta and rice packaged {{in direct contact with}} recycled cardboard. In the case of semolina pasta it was possible to discriminate between superficial contamination coming from the packaging, and pre-existing contamination (firmly enclosed into the matrix) ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} a rapid and simple high {{performance}} liquid chromatographic method with UV absorption detection at 242 nm for determining domoic acid in shellfish samples is reported. Domoic acid was extracted from shellfish tissue {{by using a}} mixture of methanol-water (50 : 50, v/v). The analyses were performed on a Water symmetry C- 8 (4. 6 x 250 mm, 5 num) achieving an excellent separation, more than 3 min, between the analyte and tryptophan (a well known interference) {{in a short time}} of analysis (15 min lasts the complete run). The in-house validation of the method provided good results with respect to <b>repeatability</b> (Relative <b>Standard</b> <b>Deviation</b> (RSD) minor or equal to 2. 21 percent) and recovery (minor or equal to 91. 2 per cent). Domoic acid was not found when the method was applied to shellfish products purchased on local markets. JRC. I. 5 -Physical and chemical exposure...|$|R
