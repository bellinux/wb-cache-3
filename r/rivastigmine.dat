5|$|Five {{medications}} {{are currently}} {{used to treat}} the cognitive problems of AD: four are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (tacrine, <b>rivastigmine,</b> galantamine and donepezil) and the other (memantine) is an NMDA receptor antagonist. The benefit from their use is small. No medication has been clearly shown to delay or halt the progression of the disease.|$|E
25|$|In a large {{clinical}} {{trial of the}} <b>rivastigmine</b> patch in 1,195 patients with Alzheimer's disease, the target dose of 9.5mg/24-hour patch provided similar clinical effects (e.g. memory and thinking, activities of daily living, concentration) as the highest doses of <b>rivastigmine</b> capsules, but with one-third fewer reports of nausea and vomiting.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rivastigmine</b> {{tartrate}} is a {{white to}} off-white, fine crystalline powder that is both lipophilic (soluble in fats) and hydrophilic (soluble in water). It comes {{in a variety of}} administrations including a capsule, solution and a transdermal patch. Like other cholinesterase inhibitors, it requires doses to be increased gradually over several weeks; this is usually referred to as the titration phase. Oral doses of <b>rivastigmine</b> should be titrated with a 3mg per day increment every 2 to 4 weeks.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rivastigmine</b> has {{demonstrated}} treatment {{effects on the}} cognitive (thinking and memory), functional (activities of daily living) and behavioural problems commonly associated with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease dementias.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rivastigmine</b> capsules, liquid {{solution}} and patches {{are used for}} the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type and for mild to moderate dementia related to Parkinson's disease.|$|E
25|$|<b>Rivastigmine,</b> an {{acetylcholinesterase}} inhibitor, inhibits both butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase (unlike donepezil, which selectively inhibits acetylcholinesterase). It {{is thought}} to work by inhibiting these cholinesterase enzymes, which would otherwise break down the brain neurotransmitter acetylcholine.|$|E
25|$|Usage of <b>rivastigmine</b> was {{associated}} with a higher frequency of reports of death as an adverse event in the Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database compared to the other acetylcholinesterase inhibiting drugs donepezil and galantamine.|$|E
25|$|Its {{efficacy}} {{is similar}} to donepezil and tacrine. Doses below 6mg/d may be ineffective. The effects {{of this kind of}} drug in different kinds of dementia (including Alzheimer's dementia) are modest, and it is still unclear which AcCh(ButCh) esterase inhibitor is better in Parkinson's dementia, though <b>rivastigmine</b> is well-studied.|$|E
25|$|The {{treatment}} {{will depend}} on the cause of memory loss, but various drugs to treat Alzheimer’s disease have been suggested in recent years. There are four drugs currently approved by the FDA for the treatment of Alzheimer’s, and they all act on the cholinergic system: Donepezil, Galantamine, <b>Rivastigmine,</b> and Tacrine. Although these medications are not the cure for Alzheimer’s, symptoms may be reduced for up to eighteen months for mild or moderate dementia. These drugs do not forestall the ultimate decline to full Alzheimer's.|$|E
2500|$|The strong {{potency of}} <b>rivastigmine,</b> {{provided}} by its dual inhibitory mechanism, has been postulated {{to lead to}} more nausea and vomiting during the titration phase of oral <b>rivastigmine</b> treatment. This enforces the importance of taking oral forms of these drugs with food as prescribed. [...] However, rates of nausea and vomiting are markedly reduced with the once-daily <b>rivastigmine</b> patch (which can be applied {{at any time of}} the day, with or without food).|$|E
2500|$|When given orally, <b>rivastigmine</b> is well absorbed, with a {{bioavailability}} {{of about}} 40% in the 3-mg dose. [...] Pharmacokinetics are linear up to 3mg , but nonlinear at higher doses. [...] Elimination {{is through the}} urine. [...] Peak plasma concentrations are seen in about one hour, with peak cerebrospinal fluid concentrations at 1.4–3.8 hours. [...] When given by once-daily transdermal patch, the pharmacokinetic profile of <b>rivastigmine</b> is much smoother, compared with capsules, with lower peak plasma concentrations and reduced fluctuations. The 9.5mg/24 h <b>rivastigmine</b> patch provides comparable exposure to 12mg/day capsules (the highest recommended oral dose).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rivastigmine</b> was {{developed}} by Marta Weinstock-Rosin of the Department of Pharmacology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and sold to Novartis by Yissum for commercial development. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of physostigmine. [...] It has been available in capsule and liquid formulations since 1997. In 2006, it became the first product approved globally {{for the treatment of}} mild to moderate dementia associated with Parkinson's disease; and in 2007 the <b>rivastigmine</b> transdermal patch became the first patch treatment for dementia.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rivastigmine</b> is {{classified}} as pregnancy category B, with insufficient data on risks associated with breastfeeding. In cases of overdose, atropine is used to reverse bradycardia. [...] Dialysis is ineffective due to the drug's half-life.|$|E
2500|$|In {{people with}} either type of dementia, <b>rivastigmine</b> {{has been shown}} to provide {{meaningful}} symptomatic effects that may allow patients to remain independent and ‘be themselves’ for longer. In particular, it appears to show marked treatment effects in patients showing a more aggressive course of disease, such as those with younger onset ages, poor nutritional status, or those experiencing symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations. [...] For example, the presence of hallucinations appears to be a predictor of especially strong responses to <b>rivastigmine,</b> both in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's [...] patients. These effects might reflect the additional inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase, which is implicated in symptom progression and might provide added benefits over acetylcholinesterase-selective drugs in some patients. Multiple-infarct dementia patients may show slight improvement in executive functions and behaviour. No firm evidence supports usage in schizophrenia patients.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Rivastigmine</b> (sold {{under the}} trade name Exelon) is a {{parasympathomimetic}} or cholinergic {{agent for the}} treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type and dementia due to Parkinson's disease. The drug can be administered orally or via a transdermal patch; the latter form reduces the prevalence of side effects, which typically include nausea and vomiting.|$|E
2500|$|They are {{examples}} of enzyme inhibitors, and increase the action of acetylcholine by delaying its degradation; some {{have been used as}} nerve agents (Sarin and VX nerve gas) or pesticides (organophosphates and the carbamates). Many toxins and venoms produced by plants and animals also contain cholinesterase inhibitors. [...] In clinical use, they are administered in low doses to reverse the action of muscle relaxants, to treat myasthenia gravis, and to treat symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (<b>rivastigmine,</b> which increases cholinergic activity in the brain).|$|E
2500|$|Treatment of the {{movement}} and cognitive portions of the disease may worsen hallucinations and psychosis, while treatment of hallucinations and psychosis with antipsychotics may worsen parkinsonian or ADHD symptoms in DLB, such as tremor or rigidity and lack of concentration or impulse control. Physicians may find the use of cholinesterase inhibitors represents the treatment of choice for cognitive problems and donepezil (Aricept), <b>rivastigmine</b> (Exelon), and galantamine (Reminyl) may be recommended {{as a means to}} help with these problems and to slow or prevent the decline of cognitive function. [...] DLB may be more responsive to donepezil than Alzheimer's disease. Memantine also may be useful. Levocarb may help with movement problems, but in some cases, as with dopamine agonists, may tend to aggravate psychosis in people with DLB. Clonazepam may help with rapid eye movement behavior disorder; table salt or antihypotensive medications may help with fainting and other problems associated with orthostatic hypotension. Botulinum toxin injections in the parotid glands may help with sialorrhea. Other medications, especially stimulants such as the ADHD drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) and modafinil, may improve daytime alertness, but as with the antiparkinsonian drug Levocarb, antihyperkinetics such as Ritalin increase the risk of psychosis. Experts advise extreme caution in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. When these medications must be used, atypical antipsychotics are preferred to typical antipsychotics; a very low dose should be tried initially and increased slowly, and patients should be carefully monitored for adverse reactions to the medications.|$|E
