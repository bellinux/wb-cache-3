The two main schools of thought hold that either religion evolved due to natural selection and has selective advantage, or that <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> evolutionary byproduct of other mental adaptations. Stephen Jay Gould, for example, believed that <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> exaptation or a spandrel, in other words that religion evolved as byproduct of psychological mechanisms that evolved for other reasons.|$|R

25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. <b>Religion</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

Several major holidays have robots associated with them, including the murderous Robot Santa and Kwanzaa-bot. While very few episodes focus exclusively on religion within the Futurama universe, they do cover a wide variety of subjects including predestination, prayer, the nature of salvation, and religious conversion.|$|E

25|$|Freedom of <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{fundamental}} right {{according to the}} Indian Constitution. The Constitution also suggests a uniform civil code for its citizens as a Directive Principle. This has not been implemented until now as Directive Principles are Constitutionally unenforceable. The Supreme Court has further held that the enactment of a uniform civil code all at once may be counter-productive to {{the unity of the}} nation, and only a gradual progressive change should be brought about (Pannalal Bansilal v State of Andhra Pradesh, 1996). In Maharishi Avadesh v Union of India (1994) the Supreme Court dismissed a petition seeking a writ of mandamus against the government to introduce a common civil code, and thus laid the responsibility of its introduction on the legislature.|$|E
25|$|The {{conversion}} of Khazars to Judaism is reported by external sources {{and in the}} Khazar Correspondence, though doubts persist. Hebrew documents, whose authenticity was long doubted and challenged, are now widely accepted by specialists as either authentic or as reflecting internal Khazar traditions. Archaeological evidence for conversion, on the other hand, remains elusive, and may reflect either the incompleteness of excavations, or that the stratum of actual adherents was thin. Conversion of steppe or peripheral tribes to a universal <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fairly well attested phenomenon, and the Khazar conversion to Judaism, though unusual, {{would not have been}} unique.

25|$|The Mayos are {{the most}} {{numerous}} indigenous ethnic group in the state with more than 75,000 who have maintained their language and traditions.

Mayo houses often have a cross made of ironwood to protect against evil. Ethnically pure Mayos tend to segregate themselves from mestizos and other ethnicities. The Mayos make their living from subsistence farming, working on larger farms and combing wild area for herbs, fruits and other resources. They also work making crafts in wood making utensils and decorative items.|$|E
