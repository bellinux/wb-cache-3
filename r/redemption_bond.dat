40|$|Evidence on the {{magnitude}} of risk aversion is essential in understanding the behavior of asset prices. Both the equity premium puzzle and the credit spread puzzle {{address the problem of}} a reasonable size of agents’ risk aversion. The estimation of risk aversion is, however, impeded by the fact that observed prices depend on risk preferences and probability beliefs. The market for German <b>redemption</b> lottery <b>bonds</b> (Tilgungsanleihen) constitutes an exceptionally clean environment to study investors’ risk preferences independent of subjective probability beliefs as the probabilities of price changes caused by redemption lotteries are objectively known. The focus of this thesis is to analyze the systematic redemption risk of lottery bonds. Our contribution to the literature is twofold. On the theoretical side, we develop a fully specified dynamic equilibrium model to price <b>redemption</b> lottery <b>bonds.</b> On the empirical side, we employ the valuation model to estimate implied risk aversion coefficients from transaction prices of German lottery bonds. Our most important findings are threefold: estimated relative risk aversion coefficients are significantly positive, of moderate magnitude, and time dependent...|$|R
5000|$|In 1671 his Waardije van Lyf-renten naer Proportie van Los-renten was {{published}} ('The Worth of Life Annuities Compared to Redemption Bonds'). This work combined {{the interests of}} the statesman and the mathematician. Ever since the Middle Ages, a Life annuity was a way to [...] "buy" [...] someone a regular income from a reliable source. The state, for instance, could provide a widow with a regular income until her death, in exchange for a 'lump sum' up front. There were also <b>Redemption</b> <b>Bonds</b> that were more like a regular state loan. De Witt showed - by using probability mathematics - that for {{the same amount of money}} a bond of 4% would result in the same profit as a Life Annuity of 6% (1 in 17). But the 'Staten' at the time were paying over 7% (1 in 14). The publication about Life Annuities is seen as the first mathematical approach of chance and probability. After the violent deaths of the brothers the 'Staten' issued new Life Annuities in 1673 for the old rate of 1 in 14.|$|R

50|$|The levelling-off of {{the growth}} of the debt in the years before 1740, and again after 1750, caused a curious dilemma for the Dutch rentiers: they kept accumulating capital from <b>bond</b> <b>redemptions</b> and {{retained}} <b>bond</b> earnings, due to an undiminished high average propensity to save (though their wealth allowed them to wallow in luxury at the same time). However, there were few attractive investment opportunities for this new capital in the domestic Dutch economy: as explained in the article on the economic history of the Netherlands, structural problems militated against expansion of the private sector, and the public debt hardly expanded (even decreased after 1750). This development gave undeniable discomfort to Dutch investors. It presented them with two unenviable alternatives: hoarding (which apparently happened on an appreciable scale, leading to a large increase in the amount of money in circulation, while the velocity of circulation dropped), or investing abroad.|$|R

40|$|The {{ports and}} harbors of Japan are {{operated}} by local public bodies {{that act as}} port authorities. The systems for constructing port facilities are roughly classified into two types depending on their sources of revenue. In the first type of system (used mainly for channels, breakwaters, berths, etc.), the national government and the port authority share the cost of construction. In {{the second type of}} system (used for cargo handling facilities, reclaimed lands etc.), the port authority raises funds by itself through a port-related bond-financed project, under which it issues bonds. One characteristic of such bond-financed projects is that the costs of operating the facility and redeeming the bonds are funded through usage fees for the cargo terminal and profit from the sale of reclaimed land. The authors first described Japan’s port facilities and the structure of port and harbor management, and analyzed the financial situation of port authorities. Next, the authors pointed out that as the capital, maintenance, and management costs of port facilities grow in response to the new risks of large-scale natural disasters and other factors, port authorities are being forced to take measures to address this. Lastly, using the example of Hakata Port, the authors argued that incentive assistance to shipping companies and logistics companies could effectively address the conflicting demands of reinforcing international competitiveness, strengthening disaster restoration capabilities, and enabling the smooth <b>redemption</b> of <b>bonds</b> in bond-financed projects. Based on the above analysis, the authors propose that facility usage fees and land prices be reduced through incentive subsidies as a measure to reduce the deficits of port authorities. This will enable the early <b>redemption</b> of <b>bonds</b> and an increase in local tax revenue, since a greater number of businesses can be attracted, as shown in the case study of Hakata Port...|$|R

50|$|Until late 2014 {{there existed}} eight undated gilts, which {{made up a}} very small {{proportion}} of the UK government's debt. They had no fixed maturity date. These gilts were very old: some, such as Consols, dated from the 18th century. The largest, War Loan, was issued in the early 20th century. The <b>redemption</b> of these <b>bonds</b> was {{at the discretion of}} the UK government, but because of their age, they all had low coupons, and so for a long time there was little incentive for the government to redeem them. Because the outstanding amounts were relatively very small, there was a very limited market in most of these gilts. In late 2014 and early 2015 the government gave notice that four of these gilts, including War Loan, would be redeemed in early 2015. The last four remaining gilts, with coupons of 2.5% or 2.75%, were redeemed on 5 July 2015.|$|R

When accounting for the interest over 110 years, the value was estimated at $3,574,636.84.

25|$|The {{mortgage}} bonds were {{a way for}} {{the bank}} to raise funds. The bonds, nominal value 100 rubles, were sold to the public by the borrower or the bank. The bank guaranteed <b>redemption</b> of the <b>bonds</b> with its capital and the mortgaged property. A market developed for these bonds. Initially, the market price fluctuated between 81 and 93.25 rubles. Due to the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the price dropped to 78 rubles. When prices rebounded and stabilized at 92–96 rubles, Russian government ordered to lower the interest rate to 5% in 1886. In 1895, the bonds traded at 99–102 rubles and the government lowered the interest to 4.5%. In 1900, among Russian land banks, only Moscow Land Bank had more outstanding mortgage bonds. During the Russian Revolution of 1905, the bond price dropped to 68 rubles. After the revolution, the market recovered and in early 1913 Vilnius Land Bank had 146.5 million rubles worth of mortgage bonds outstanding. In 1913 they traded at an average of 86 rubles.|$|R
50|$|The most {{prolific}} author on dedicated portfolio theory, Martin L. Leibowitz, {{was the first}} to refer to dedicated portfolios as “cash matching” portfolios. He demonstrated how they are the simplest case of the technique known as bond portfolio immunization. In his sketch of its history, he traces the origin of immunization to Frederick R. Macaulay who first suggested the notion of “duration” for fixed income securities in 1938. Duration represents the average life of the coupon payments and <b>redemption</b> of a <b>bond</b> and links changes in interest rates to the volatility of a bond’s value. One year later, J.R. Hicks independently developed a similar formulation referred to as the “average period.” In 1942, T.C. Koopmans pointed out in a report that, by matching the duration of the bonds held in a portfolio to the duration of liabilities those bonds would fund, the effects of interest rate changes could be mitigated or nullified completely, i.e. immunized. In 1945, Paul Samuelson formulated essentially the same concept, calling it the “weighted-average time period.” None of these earliest researchers cited each other’s work, suggesting each developed the concept independently. The work culminated in a 1952 paper by a British actuary, F. M. Redington.|$|R
50|$|The Solidus Bond {{utilizes}} SHA-256 elliptical encryption on a decentralized {{block chain}} {{to create and}} redeem debt instruments issued in a digital currency. The bonds are brought into existence upon command by any investor via algorithm rather than fiat. Coupon payments and <b>bond</b> <b>redemption</b> are also executed by algorithm, {{eliminating the need for}} brokerages and theoretically reducing bond duration to zero, making credit ratings obsolete. Investors choose bond size and bond maturity of seven days to 10 years. Payments are emitted from the block chain to the SwiftCoin wallet chosen by the investor at the time of bond creation. There are no commissions or fees to pay. The only requirement to purchase a Solidus Bond is a SwiftCoin wallet and a sufficient balance of the SwiftCoin digital currency to cover the face value of the bond. Bond ownership is conveyed solely through possession. There are no accounts, records, or user databases and the block chain ledger is not public. Interest rates are set by the market and were 18% in 2016. Holders of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies convert to SwiftCoin to access the Solidus Bond block chain, then cash back into their initial currency at bond expiry. Solidus Bonds are not open source. Unlike Bitcoin, Solidus Bonds cannot be mined.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{identifies}} {{a number}} of key areas of economic modernization - modernization of property, modernization of financial system, modernization of regional governance and modernization of social sphere. The problems that arise in these areas and their solutions are noted. Disclosure of modernization of the real sector of the economy is made. Mechanisms of technological renovation and restructuring, the sources of the rapid modernization of public production are defined. Modernization of property includes: mass privatization of state property, aimed at its commercial use and creation of favorable economic environment for small business development. Modernization of the financial system must follow the path of reducing the tax burden on business and increasing the role of banks (assets of the banks should not be less than 150 % of GDP). Technological upgrade in the real sector will allow raising productivity by 2 - 3 times in the next 7 - 10 years, to halve energy intensity of GDP, to create material conditions for manufacturing of innovative products. The restructuring will help diversify the economic structure and exports, create competitive advantages for taking leading position in the field of aerospace engineering, production and export of electricity and electric machine manufacturing products, production of finished goods made from synthetic materials of forest products over time to become the world's leader.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the price {{sensitivity}} of fixed-income securities to the interest rate changes, expressing a dominant source of financial risk the financial institutions or other market participants manage. The most common modelling technique used by practitioners for measuring and managing the bond price sensitivity is the Macaulay's duration normally expressed in the modified duration form, also known as weighted average maturity of the bond, or the bond price sensitivity to the interest rate changes. Taking into account {{the fact that the}} standard concept of the duration has its limitations as the accuracy for small yield changes, a nonparallel shift in the yield curve or option-free bond assumption, we derive and describe the effective duration and convexity models for determining the expected theoretical price of the bonds with embedded options enabling the <b>bond</b> <b>redemption</b> prior to the maturity. To demonstrate computation and effect of the embedded option in a bond contract we use fun- damental characteristic of an option-free bond and two most common types of embedded options - call option and put options giving the issuer the right to call or prepay the debt obligation prior to the scheduled principal payment date (call option) or giving the investor the right to require the issuer to purchase the bond at a specified price (put option). To determine the theoretical price of the embedded option rights we use these two methods coupled with the modified Black model to cope with limitation of the traditional Macaulay's dura- tion approach. The results show a significant impact of the embedded options on the effective duration and convexity of fixed income securities...|$|R
40|$|The Social Security {{trust funds}} are {{projected}} to become exhausted in 2033, according to the 2013 Social Security Trustees Report. If Congress does not act before then, the trust funds {{would be unable to}} pay full Social Security benefits on time. The Social Security Act does not specify what would happen to benefits if the trust funds became insolvent. However, it is clear that full Social Security benefits could not be paid on time because the Antideficiency Act prohibits government spending in excess of available funds. After insolvency, Social Security would continue to receive tax income, from which approximately 77 % of benefits could be paid. Either full benefit checks would be paid on a delayed schedule or reduced benefits would be paid on time. In either case, Social Security beneficiaries and qualifying applicants would remain legally entitled to full benefits and could take legal action to claim the balance of their benefits. Social Security solvency could be restored by cutting Social Security’s spending, increasing its income, or some combination of the two. Over the long range (i. e., over the next 75 years), the Social Security trustees estimate that the trust funds have a shortfall of $ 9. 6 trillion in present value terms, or 2. 72 % of taxable payroll. The sooner Congress acts to fill this gap, the smaller the changes to Social Security need to be, because earlier changes could be spread to a larger number of workers and beneficiaries {{over a longer period of}} time. If Congress waits until the moment of insolvency to act, the trust funds’ annual deficits could be eliminated with benefit cuts of about 23 % in 2033 that will gradually rise to about 27 % by 2087. Congress could also eliminate annual deficits by raising the Social Security payroll tax rate from 12. 40 % to 16. 1 % in 2033, then gradually increasing it to 17. 2 % by 2086. To maintain annual balance after 2086, larger benefit reductions or tax increases would be required. Prompt action to restore Social Security solvency would be advantageous. The combined trust funds began to run annual cash-flow deficits in 2010. Cash-flow deficits require the <b>redemption</b> of government <b>bonds</b> accumulated in earlier years. Cash-flow deficits do not affect Social Security directly. However, if the non-Social Security portion of the federal budget is in deficit, redemption of trust fund bonds puts additional pressure on the overall federal budget. Earlier changes would allow workers and beneficiaries time to adjust their retirement plans. Finally, if Congress were to act today, the benefit cuts or tax increases necessary to restore solvency until 2087 would be smaller than those needed if Congress waited until the trust funds became insolvent to act...|$|R
