5|$|Silver {{does not}} react with air, even at <b>red</b> <b>heat,</b> and thus was {{considered}} by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to <b>red</b> <b>heat)</b> and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air {{to form the}} black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, {{with the exception of}} the notoriously reactive fluorine gas, with which it forms the difluoride. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{is useful}} in the {{manufacture}} of chemical equipment on account of its low chemical reactivity, high thermal conductivity, and being easily workable. Silver crucibles (alloyed with 0.15% nickel to avoid recrystallisation of the metal at <b>red</b> <b>heat)</b> are used for carrying out alkaline fusion. Copper and silver are also used when doing chemistry with fluorine. Equipment made to work at high temperatures is often silver-plated. Silver and its alloys with gold are used as wire or ring seals for oxygen compressors and vacuum equipment.|$|E
5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin was {{the creator}} of the long-running BBC police drama Z-Cars (1962–1978). He also wrote the {{screenplay}} for the films The Italian Job (1969) and Kelly's Heroes (1970) and scripts for television series such as Colditz (1972–1974), The Sweeney (1975–1978) (which was created by his brother Ian Kennedy Martin) and Reilly, Ace of Spies (1983). Following Edge of Darkness, he wrote the screenplays for the films <b>Red</b> <b>Heat</b> (with Walter Hill) (1988) and Bravo Two Zero (1999). He died in September 2009.|$|E

25|$|During the 1980s, audiences had an {{appetite}} for action films, with both Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone becoming international stars. Schwarzenegger's roles reflected his sense of humor, separating him from more serious action hero films. He {{made a number of}} successful action films in the '80s, such as Commando (1985), Raw Deal (1986), The Running Man (1987), Predator (1987), and <b>Red</b> <b>Heat</b> (1988).|$|E

25|$|Milton Chantry was {{incorporated}} into the fort's perimeter and was converted into an artillery barracks. By the 1790s, additional buildings had been constructed, including quarters for the commanding officer, stables and magazines. The rear of the fort was originally open, {{but by the end}} of the 18th century a defence wall and caponier with loopholes for muskets had been built to close it off. A kiln was also built to heat shot to a <b>red</b> <b>heat</b> for setting ships on fire.|$|E
25|$|Cutting is {{initiated}} by heating the edge or leading face (as in cutting shapes such as round rod) {{of the steel}} to the ignition temperature (approximately bright cherry <b>red</b> <b>heat)</b> using the pre-heat jets only, then using the separate cutting oxygen valve to release the oxygen from the central jet. The oxygen chemically combines with the iron in the ferrous material to oxidize the iron quickly into molten iron oxide, producing the cut. Initiating {{a cut in the}} middle of a workpiece is known as piercing.|$|E
25|$|Walter Hill (born January 10, 1942) is an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. He {{is widely}} {{known for his}} action films and revival of the Western genre.

40|$|Many {{buildings}} were designed and calculated by advanced software tools and simulation tools. However in real practice these buildings do not achieve the calculated energy efficiency, but use up to 40 to 50 % more energy. One {{of the reasons}} for the discrepant ion between designed performance and real performance is the human behavior of which no real adequate integration into the design tools exists Therefore new design approaches are needed to implement the real behavior of occupants of buildings. Human-in-the-loop Technology is developed; a technology to implement user behavior. By starting from the human perspective and use available and new technology, we determined the critical performance indicators for the perceived human comfort. To further optimize the performance of these systems, further development is done into the possibilities and use of infra <b>red</b> <b>heating</b> systems for individual comfort control on workplace level...|$|R
50|$|Murexide test is a {{color test}} for uric acid {{and some other}} purines. The (solid) sample is first treated with conc. nitric acid, which is slowly {{evaporated}} away; subsequent addition of ammonia solution (NH4OH) gives a purple color if uric acid was present, due to formation of murexide, or a yellow color that turns to <b>red</b> on <b>heating</b> if a xanthine is present.|$|R
25|$|Hill {{returned}} to the buddy-cop genre with <b>Red</b> <b>Heat</b> (1988), a sort of Glasnost-era reworking of 48 Hrs. with Arnold Schwarzenegger as a stoic Soviet cop who travels to Chicago to catch a Russian drug-dealer (Ed O'Ross). Schwarzenegger is partnered with a wisecracking American cop (James Belushi), who is as laid-back and mouthy as his Soviet counterpart is taciturn and humorless. Hill directed and rewrote Troy Kennedy Martin's script. The movie, whilst profitable, {{was considered to be}} a box office disappointment compared to other Schwarzenegger films around this time.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of radioactivity {{and its associated}} heating properties in 1895 prompted a re-examination of the apparent age of the Earth. This had previously been estimated by its cooling rate {{under the assumption that}} the Earth's surface radiated like a black body. Those calculations had implied that, even if it started at <b>red</b> <b>heat,</b> the Earth would have dropped to its present temperature in a few tens of millions of years. Armed with the knowledge of a new heat source, scientists realized that the Earth would be much older, and that its core was still sufficiently hot to be liquid.|$|E
25|$|To {{the extent}} that a hot surface emits thermal {{radiation}} but is not an ideal black-body radiator, the color temperature of the light is not the actual temperature of the surface. An incandescent lamp's light is thermal radiation, and the bulb approximates an ideal black-body radiator, so its color temperature is essentially {{the temperature of the}} filament. Thus a relatively low temperature emits a dull red and a high temperature emits the almost white of the traditional incandescent light bulb. Metal workers are able to judge the temperature of hot metals by their color, from dark red to orange-white and then white (see <b>red</b> <b>heat).</b>|$|E

50|$|By May 1899, {{the plans}} had been firmed up {{to include a}} two-story {{structure}} with basement, with an interior to be finished in <b>red</b> oak. <b>Heat</b> would be provided by steam, with electric fans and an automated clock and signal system. The main floor assembly room was expanded to seat 700. Construction was set to begin in June, with completion in October. The original building was located at 154th Street and Columbia Avenue.|$|R
25|$|While {{working the}} {{attachment}} in Philadelphia, House {{was asked if}} he could help one of Union's western branches in making the paper dishes, as they had trouble in drying them. When House produced samples with a round flange, the design was accepted and he was given a contract to build a machine that would make twenty thousand paper dishes in 10 hours. Much work was required to maintain the heat at 800 to 900 degrees, which was necessary to dry a dish in two (2) seconds. Mr. House involved a system of using superheated steam which kept the dies at <b>red</b> <b>heat.</b> The press was first tested at his factory in Bridgeport before being shipped to Clinton, Iowa.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{vacuum tubes}} strongly resembled incandescent light bulbs and {{were made by}} lamp manufacturers, who had the equipment needed to manufacture glass envelopes and the vacuum pumps required to evacuate the enclosures. De Forest used Heinrich Geissler's mercury displacement pump, which left behind a partial vacuum. The development of the diffusion pump in 1915 and improvement by Irving Langmuir {{led to the development}} of high-vacuum tubes. After World War I, specialized manufacturers using more economical construction methods were set up to fill the growing demand for broadcast receivers. Bare tungsten filaments operated at a temperature of around 2200°C. The development of oxide-coated filaments in the mid-1920s reduced filament operating temperature to a dull <b>red</b> <b>heat</b> (around 700°C), which in turn reduced thermal distortion of the tube structure and allowed closer spacing of tube elements. This in turn improved tube gain, since the gain of a triode is inversely proportional to the spacing between grid and cathode. Bare tungsten filaments remain in use in small transmitting tubes but are brittle and tend to fracture if handled roughly – e.g. in the postal services. These tubes are best suited to stationary equipment where impact and vibration is not present.|$|E

50|$|Žažar is {{also known}} locally as Žajžar. The priest and {{historian}} Peter Hicinger explained the name as meaning žarišče 'focal point of a fire', from the verb žariti 'to <b>heat</b> (<b>red</b> hot)'. In the past it was known as Saschar or Schaschar in German.|$|R
500|$|In 1803, Smithson Tennant {{analyzed}} the insoluble residue {{and concluded that}} it must contain a new metal. Vauquelin treated the powder alternately with alkali and acids and obtained a volatile new oxide, which he believed to be of this new metal—which he named ptene, from the Greek word [...] (ptènos) for winged. However, Tennant, who {{had the advantage of}} a much larger amount of residue, continued his research and identified two previously undiscovered elements in the black residue, iridium and osmium. He obtained a yellow solution (probably of cis–2−) by reactions with sodium hydroxide at <b>red</b> <b>heat.</b> After acidification he was able to distill the formed OsO4. He named it osmium after Greek osme meaning [...] "a smell", because of the ashy and smoky smell of the volatile osmium tetroxide. Discovery of the new elements was documented {{in a letter to the}} Royal Society on June 21, 1804.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{released}} in Japan as Shakunetsu-no ketto (Fight Under the <b>Red</b> <b>Heat)</b> in April 1954, where it was distributed by Nippon Cinema Corporation (NCC). It was the first Tamil film dubbed in Japanese, and the second Indian film released in Japan; {{the first was the}} 1952 Hindi film Aan, which {{was released in}} Tokyo in January 1954. NCC later collapsed, and no information about Chandralekha Japanese release survives. During the 1950s (when foreign currency was scarce in India), barter was a common means of exchange with overseas business partners; Reitaku University's Tamaki Matsuoka believes that this was the case with Chandralekha. An NCC pamphlet about the film called Vasan the [...] "Cecil B. DeMille of the Indian film industry". A Danish version of the film, Indiens hersker (India's Ruler), was released on 26 April 1954. An abridged English-language version of Chandralekha, Chandra, was screened in the United States and Europe during the 1950s.|$|E

50|$|Glühwein {{is usually}} {{prepared}} from <b>red</b> wine, <b>heated</b> and spiced with cinnamon sticks, cloves, star aniseed, citrus, sugar {{and at times}} vanilla pods. It is sometimes drunk mit Schuss (with a shot), which means that rum or some other liquor has been added. Fruit wines, such as blueberry wine and cherry wine, are occasionally used instead of grape wine {{in some parts of}} Germany. There is also a variation of Glühwein which is made with white wine. However, white Glühwein is less popular than its red counterpart.|$|R
50|$|The normal {{primary and}} {{secondary}} hues in tanzanite are blue and violet. Untreated tanzanite is a trichroic gemstone, meaning that light that enters this anisotropic crystal gets refracted on different paths, with different color absorption {{on each of the}} three optical axes.
