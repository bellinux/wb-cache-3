Also that year he headed organizing the committee of the First All- Union Conference on the Atomic Nucleus. Kurchatov studied neutron absorption by the nuclei and discovered nuclear isomerism two years later in 1935. Later in 1935 he held a seminar on neutron physics, while also working with L.V. Mysovskii at the State Radium Institute. In 1937 he investigated <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> absorption by nuclei. Kurchatov started {{to take part in}} cyclotron and the development in 1941 jointly with A.I. Alikhanov of the LFTI cyclotron and completed it after World War II. Finally he helped with the discovery of the fission process with O.Hahn and F. Strassman and then they started an in depth investigation of uranium. This investigation brought about determining the number of secondary fission neutrons; isolating uranium-235 as a fissile isotope; and, finally discovering the spontaneous fission of uranium-238 with G.N. Flerov and K.A. Pertzhak. In 1941, the Kurchatov group had joined the ranks of the leading laboratories in Europe and the United States. Then this group started working on chain reactions. Kurchatov was aware of the unique prospects of this new research area and {{became a member of the}} Uranium Committee at the Academy of Sciences. V.G.

40|$|AbstractThe {{scientific}} {{interest in}} the <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> induced capture and fission reactions on 239 Pu is continuously rising during the last decade. From a practical point of view, this is because more precise data on capture and fission cross sections, fission fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions, variation of prompt fission neutron and gamma yields in the <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> region, are needed for the modelling of new generation nuclear power plants and for nuclear spent fuel and waste transmutation. From a heuristic and fundamental point of view, such a research improves our {{knowledge and understanding of}} the fission phenomena itself. To achieve these goals more powerful neutron sources and more precise fission product detectors have to be used. At the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics (FLNP), where already half a century the thermal and <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> induced nuclear reactions are studied, a new electron accelerator driven white spectrum pulsed neutron source IREN has been built and successfully tested. The improved characteristics of this facility, in comparison with those of the former pulse neutron fast reactor IBR- 30, will allow measuring some of the neutron-nuclear reaction data with better precision and accuracy. A new experimental setup for detecting gamma rays (and neutrons) has been designed and is under construction. It will consist of 2 rings (arrays) of 12 NaI(Tl) detectors each (or 1 array of 24 detectors) with variable ring diameter and distance between both rings. Such a setup will make possible not only to measure the multiplicity, energy and angular anisotropy of prompt fission gammas, but also to separate the contribution of prompt fission neutrons by their longer time-of-flight from the fissile target to the detectors. The signals from all the 24 detectors will be recorded simultaneously in digitized form and will be stored on the hard disk of the personal computer for further off-line analysis.

We investigate the possibility to use this technique for the industrial production of Mo- 99 and Xe- 125 by <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> capture in Mo- 98 and Xe- 124, respectively. Their daughters, i. e. Tc- 99 m and I- 125, are widely used in medical applications. The high neutron flux needed is produced by bombarding a thick Be target with 65 or 75 MeV proton beam (few microamperes). This target is placed at the centre of a large cubic lead assembly (1. 6 m side, purity: 99. 999 %). The neutrons are progressively slowed down by elastic scattering on lead, and their energies "scan" the region where neutron resonances occur (in the eV range). Samples are properly located in the lead assembly where the <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> capture probability is maximised. This paper presents the very promising results obtained by activation of metallic Mo-nat foils and Xe-nat. The results obtained on Au, In and W samples are also presented.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to obtain {{experimental}} data on the incident neutron energy dependence of the relative weights of the two main asymmetric fission modes, which make up the mass distribution of the 235 U(n,f) -reaction. This dependence of the fission modes {{as a function of}} incident neutron energy in 235 U(n,f) was discovered in Ref. [1]. But so far it is the only measurement where fission mode fluctuations in <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> induced fission were detected. The statistical significance of the data of Ref. [1] below 8 eV was not high enough to draw conclusions on the physical nature of the fluctuations. Based on the progress in fission cross-section and the multi-modal model calculations reported in Ref. [2] it was found reasonable to analyse the data of the measurement reported in Ref. [3]. Measurements of fission fragment (FF) mass and total kinetic energy (TKE) distributions of 235 U(n,f) were carried out at the Dubna IBR- 30 time of flight spectrometer in the <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> energy range from thermal up to 35 eV. In the energy range from thermal to 8. 77 eV individual resonances could be resolved, but for the higher incident neutron energies the resolution degraded due to the rather large (4 s) width of the neutron pulse. The data analysis was carried out in two steps. At first the experimental difficulties were investigated i. e. the very close proximity to the source, the alignment of the ionisation chamber was checked and necessary improvements were made. At the final step FF mass yield and TKE distributions were evaluated for various incident neutron energy intervals and the difference of these values obtained for thermal and <b>resonance</b> <b>neutron</b> energies was constructed. In contrast to Ref. [1] we realised true relative measurements (with respect to thermal energy). The data analysis confirmed the main characteristics of the asymmetric fission modes obtained in Ref. [1] from thermal neutron induced fission of 235 U as well as the scale of the fluctuation of the fission mode weights in different neutron resonances (~ 15 % for the standard I and ~ 4 % for the standard II mode). Some differences between {{the results of the present}} work to the results obtained in Ref. [1] could be explained by the worse neutron energy resolution of the present investigation as well as due to the data analysis, where new calibration results obtained after the publication of Ref. [1] were used. References 1. 	F. -J. Hambsch, H. -H. Knitter, C. Budtz-Jorgensen, and J. P. Theobald, Nucl. Phys. A 491, 56 (1989). 2. F. -J. Hambsch, Proc. 12 th Int.
