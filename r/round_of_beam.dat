40|$|Using a {{two-dimensional}} fluid description, we investigate the nonlinear radial-longitudinal dynamics <b>of</b> intense <b>beams</b> in isochronous cyclotrons in the nonrelativistic limit. With a multiscale analysis separating the time scale {{associated with the}} betatron motion and the slower time scale associated with space-charge effects, we show that the longitudinal-radial vortex motion can be understood in the frame moving with the charged beam as the nonlinear advection <b>of</b> the <b>beam</b> by the E×B velocity field, where E is the electric field due to the space charge and B is the external magnetic field. This interpretation provides simple explanations for the stability <b>of</b> <b>round</b> <b>beams</b> and {{for the development of}} spiral halos in elongated beams.

40|$|A {{method of}} {{measuring}} the spot size or bunch length of intense charged particle beams is proposed. The {{relation between the}} size (widths and length) of a charged particle beam and the beam' s electric field forms {{the basis for a}} sub-micron beam size monitor. When the beam passes through a low pressure gas of high Z atoms, the beam field causes multiple ionizations of the gas atoms. The appearance of ionized atoms in a given charge state gives information about the field <b>of</b> the <b>beam</b> and hence its size. Sample calculations show that appearance thresholds can indicate the spot size <b>of</b> <b>round</b> <b>beams</b> with 10 nm accuracy or the bunch length <b>of</b> <b>round</b> or flat <b>beams</b> with up to 10 #m accuracy.

40|$|Abstract. The {{synchrotron}} radiation {{is an important}} light source used to improve the measurement resolution and efficiency of scientific equipments. The electrons in radio frequency system are accelerated by the {{synchrotron radiation}} superconducting cavity. Tensile or compressive loads along the axial direction may be applied on this thin-walled shell cavity for compensating the frequency shift due to the variations of surrounding condition. In {{order to avoid the}} failure of the thin-walled shell cavity before the frequency tuning process, the finite element method and experiment were used to predict the deformation behavior and limit load of thin-walled shell cavity. The parameters such as thickness, material properties and radius <b>of</b> <b>round</b> <b>beam</b> tube were discussed. The finite element results show that the limit loads were overestimated when the material properties were assumed to be linear elastic. When the cavity becomes thicker, the limit loads and the maximum compressive displacements of thin-walled shell cavity increase. The analysis method used in this paper can help us find the tunable ranges of synchrotron radiation superconducting cavities with different thicknesses, material properties and geometries...|$|R

We tested twenty pieces of green wood with average length, diameter and conicity of 750 cm, 30 cm and 4 %, respectively. Two static bending tests were applied at three points of each piece, being nondestructive and using different distances between supports. In the first trial, the length and diameter relationship (L/ d) was set as being equal to 24; yet in the second test, it was set at 12. The elasticity moduli were estimated by a successive use <b>of</b> the Timoshenko <b>beam</b> theory equation, which takes into account the shearing stress effect on displacement calculations. The results of both longitudinal and shear moduli were related through the least square assessment method; thus, we could find a relationship of G = E/ 43.

40|$|For {{the last}} decade, {{optimization}} <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> orientations in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) {{has been shown}} to be successful in improving the treatment plan. Unfortunately, the quality of a set <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> orientations depends heavily on its corresponding beam intensity profiles. Usually, a stochastic selector is used for optimizing beam orientation, and then a single objective inverse treatment planning algorithm is used for the optimization <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> intensity profiles. The overall time needed to solve the inverse planning for every random selection <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> orientations becomes excessive. Recently, considerable improvement has been made in optimizing beam intensity profiles by using multiple objective inverse treatment planning. Such an approach results in a variety <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> intensity profiles for every selection <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> orientations, making the dependence between beam orientations and its intensity profiles less important. This thesis takes advantage of this property to accelerate the optimization process through an approximation of the intensity profiles that are used for multiple selections <b>of</b> <b>beam</b> orientations, saving a considerable amount of calculation time. A dynamic algorithm (DA) and evolutionary algorithm (EA), for beam orientations in IMRT planning will be presented. The DA mimics, automatically, the methods <b>of</b> <b>beam's</b> eye view and observer's view which are recognized in conventional conformal radiation therapy. The EA is based on a dose-volume histogram evaluation function introduced as an attempt to minimize the deviation between the mathematical and clinical optima. To illustrate the efficiency of the algorithms they have been applied to different clinical examples. In comparison to the standard equally spaced beams plans, improvements are reported for both algorithms in all the clinical examples even when, for some cases, fewer beams are used. A smaller number <b>of</b> <b>beams</b> is always desirable without compromising the quality of the treatment plan.
