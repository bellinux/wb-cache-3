[...] With only Provost and the {{producers}} knowing {{the real reason}} for the changes, the press was told the show had done all the [...] "boy and his dog" [...] stories possible, but Lockhart speculated that Provost's mother wanted too much money. and Reilly later stated that the producers' decision was based upon trading four advanced salaries for future star Robert Bray's starting salary. Lockhart loved her role as [...] "Lassie's mother", but accepted her fate, telling columnist Bob Thomas: It was an actor's dream -- steady work, excellent pay, a wonderful cast and crew, and a chance to do a good scene now and then...Now I'm <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> playing all those tramps and neurotic and alcoholic women.

I was very surprised and very happy when I got a phone call on Sunday to say that something could be happening here ... Dropping into League One isn't a worry for me because this is a club on the up and I didn't want to be stuck at Stoke just picking my money up because that isn't me" [...] On 18 June 2013, having made sufficient first-team appearances for Sheffield United, Higginbotham activated a clause in his contract to extend it for the following season.|$|E

The less fuss made the better, in my opinion. She won't miss much by not going to school, as far as THAT goes. Mr. Phillips isn't any good at all as a teacher. The order he keeps is scandalous, that's what, and he neglects the young fry and puts all his time on those big {{scholars}} he's getting ready for Queen's. He'd never have got the school for another year if his uncle hadn't been a trustee--THE trustee, for he just leads the other two around by the nose, that's what.

2500|$|The shuttle astronauts <b>went</b> <b>to</b> {{sleep as}} planned but were {{awakened by the}} sound of a master alarm on board Atlantis at 22:07 GMT. The tone {{signaled}} a failure with one of Atlantis's five IBM AP-101 General Purpose Computers (GPCs) No. 4. The alarm prompted Commander Ferguson to head to Atlantis and evaluate the issue. GPC-4 was running system management software at the time of failure. Ferguson with the help of Ground Control later transferred the failed GPC's programs onto GPC-2. The transfer took about 45 minutes, bypassing an expected period of loss of signal by utilizing communications at White Sands, New Mexico. After activating GPC-2 and with Atlantis in good shape, Ferguson and other crew members <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> sleep. [...] "You all have done an absolutely fabulous job.

5000|$|Daybreak had {{initially}} costed the drama at £8 million, which with some trimming {{they had been}} able to pare back to £7 million. Channel 4 committed £4 million, roughly in line with the channel's hourly rate for prestige drama. Other sources of funding were more difficult. In France, a deal giving Canal + first-run subscription broadcast rights, with free-to-air rights on ARTE a year later, was negotiated by Daybreak's long-standing production contact Georges Campana, bringing in a further £1 million. SBS (a frequent co-producer with ARTE) secured Australian rights, and some top-up funding was obtained from the E.U. media fund. However pre-sale negotiations for America and Germany ran into the sand. Eventually, having put back filming from an original autumn 2009 start, and with everything else <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> Kosminsky <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Channel 4 and said that without another £1 million the series wasn't going to happen. Exceptionally, Channel 4 agreed the extra funding, and filming started in Israel in early 2010 under the revised title Homeland, beginning with the period scenes at Stella Maris. [...] Channel 4 presented its support as part of a £20 million investment in drama, also including This is England '86 and Any Human Heart, made possible by cancellation of the £50 million per series it was previously spending on Big Brother.|$|R

And since no one knew her inward feelings, all were puzzled except Winton. The nursing of her child was promptly stopped.|$|R

[...] When an unbroken horse would be brought in, this cowboy chief would give it to an Indian to ride bareback. [...] After the animal was well broken, it would {{be taken away from}} the Indian and given to a cowboy to ride. [...] Then the Indian would be given another unbroken horse. [...] For a while we said nothing about it, but finally it began to be just a little too much to stand. [...] One day one of the Indians came to me just before it was time to enter the arena. [...] His horse was saddled and bridled, but he was leading the horse by the bridle. [...] I asked him what was the matter, and {{he said it was a}} wild horse and he was not going to ride it into the arena. [...] I went to the chief cowboy and said, ‘I do not think you are doing right. [...] You know our Indian boys have to ride bareback, but you always give them the wild horses to ride. [...] Then, when they have the horse nicely broken, you give to a cowboy. [...] Why don’t you give the wild horses to the cowboys to break in? [...] They ride on saddles, and it would not be so hard for them.’ [...] But the chief cowboy only said, “Well, I can’t be bothered by a little thing like that. [...] You will have to see Buffalo Bill about the horses.’ [...] But I retorted, “You know very well that Buffalo Bill does not know what you do with the horses. [...] He does not know that you give the wild ones to the Indian boys to ride until they are broken in. [...] Give that horse back to that Indian boy or he will not go into the arena today.’ [...] That was all, but the boy got his horse in time to enter the arena with the others. [...] Just as I was <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> to the Indians, I looked at Buffalo Bill, and he had a twinkle in his eye. [...] After that, we had no more trouble with the horses. [...] Although Buffalo Bill never said anything to me, I knew he had fixed things to our satisfaction.” ...|$|E
