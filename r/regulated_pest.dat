The assay detected A. woodi down to a 1  % incidence level in bees and 1000 copies of the target DNA when using plasmid standards. Initial testing showed no cross-reaction with the other two Acarapis species from different geographical regions or with other species of mites associated with bees. However, during extensive testing of bees, a rare population of Acarapis externus mite was identified that did cross-react with the assay.

Many disputes about the justification of this classification have arisen during the past years as records have been published regarding the presence of this pathogen in South Africa. Results of several surveys conducted from 1985 in stone fruit orchards, revealed that M. laxa is the only causal agent of brown rot in South Africa. However, another notification of non-compliance (interception of regulated pests) was received by the National Plant Protection Organisation of South Africa in 2003 stating that M. fructicola was detected on consignments of South African Prunus fruits (P. domestica) in the United Kingdom. A detection survey according to inspections and sampling relevant to the biology of Monilinia species were conducted in the identified orchards at various stages throughout the year. Molecular techniques with species-specific primers for M. fructicola, M. laxa and M. fructigena based on the EPPO Diagnostic Protocol for M. fructicola were used for the identification of presumptive positive Monilinia isolates. The absence of M. fructicola from South African stone fruit orchards was again confirmed by this survey and its status in South Africa can be reported as: absent, not known to occur, confirmed by a detection survey.

The original publication is available at [URL] drivers of population fluctuation, especially for agricultural pests, {{is central to the}} provision of agro-ecosystem services. Here, we examine the role of endogenous density dependence and exogenous factors of climate and human activity in regulating the 37 -year population dynamics of an important agricultural insect pest, the cotton bollworm (Helicoverpa armigera), in North China from 1975 to 2011. Quantitative time-series analysis provided strong evidence explaining long-term population dynamics of the cotton bollworm and its driving factors. Rising temperature and declining rainfall exacerbated the effect of agricultural intensification on continuously weakening the negative density dependence in regulating the population dynamics of cotton bollworms. Consequently, ongoing {{climate change and}} agricultural intensification unleashed the tightly <b>regulated</b> <b>pest</b> population and triggered the regional outbreak of H. armigera in 1992. Although the negative density dependence can effectively regulate the population change rate to fluctuate around zero at stable equilibrium levels before and after outbreak in the 1992, the population equilibrium jumped to a higher density level with apparently larger amplitudes after the outbreak. The results highlight the possibility for exogenous factors to induce pest outbreaks and alter the population regulating mechanism of negative density dependence and, thus, the stable equilibrium of the pest population, often to a higher level, posing considerable risks to the provision of agroecosystem services and regional food security. Efficient and timely measures of pest management in the era of Anthropocene should target the strengthening and revival of weakening density dependence caused by climate change and human activities.

40|$|In January 2005, {{mild mosaic}} and {{chlorosis}} were observed on leaves of shallot (Allium cepa var. aggregatum) ‘Red Prisma’ growing in Marlborough, New Zealand. Leaves from 100 plants were collected and bulked into groups of ten. Three composite samples {{tested positive for}} Shallot mite-borne latent virus (ShMbLV) using polyclonal antiserum (supplied by Dr. E. Barg, Biologische Bundesanstalt, Germany) in an antigen-coated plate enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ACP-ELISA). Similar symptoms were seen in shallot ‘Jermor’ in the same region in December 2007. Leaves from these plants also tested positive for ShMbLV by ACP-ELISA. To confirm {{the identification of the}} samples from 2007, dried tissue of the type isolate of ShMbLV was obtained (Van Dijk & van der Vlugt, 1994). RNA was extracted from diseased shallot samples and the ShMbLV type isolate and tested by RT-PCR using primers that amplify a ca. 750 bp fragment between the coat protein (CP) and ORF 6 region of allexiviruses (Chen et al., 2004). For both samples, amplicons of the expected size were obtained and sequenced directly. Analysis showed a 93 to 95 % nucleotide identity with Shallot virus X (ShVX) (GenBank Accession No. M 97264). RT-PCR was then done using specific primers designed to amplify a 912 bp fragment of ShVX including the CP gene (ShVX-CPF: 5 '-ATTTAGGGGTGAAGGTCTGT- 3 '; ShVX-CPR: 5 '-GAGTTTTGAGGTCGTTGG- 3 '). Amplicons of the correct size were obtained from both diseased shallot samples and the ShMbLV type isolate. Subsequently, one-step immunocapture RT-PCR was performed using the ShMbLV antiserum and the ShVX-specific primers, and bands of the correct size were obtained for both samples. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. A BLAST search showed that the sequence from shallot (EU 835197) and that of the type isolate of ShMbLV (EU 835196) showed 93 % and 95 % nucleotide identity, respectively, with ShVX (M 97264). According to the criteria demarcating species in the genus (Adams et al., 2004), we suggest that ShMbLV should be considered a synonym of ShVX as previously proposed (Van Dijk & van der Vlugt, 1994). This is the first report of ShVX in New Zealand and until these findings it was considered a <b>regulated</b> <b>pest.</b> However, no phytosanitary measures will be imposed to eradicate the virus and it is likely to spread in the future, especially as the vector, Aceria tulipae, is present in New Zealand.

40|$|An {{interesting}} conundrum {{in biological}} control questions {{the efficiency of}} generalist predators as biological control agents. Theory suggests, generalist predators are poor agents for biological control, primarily due to mutual interference.

We show that the inclusion of predator interference alone, can cause {{the solution of the}} top predator equation to blow-up in finite time, while there is global existence in the no interference case. This result shows that interference could actually cause a population explosion of the top predator, enabling it to control the target species, thus corroborating recent field evidence. Our results might also partially explain the population explosion of certain species, introduced originally for biological control purposes, such as the cane toad (Bufo marinus) in Australia, which now functions as a generalist top predator.

The effects of soil type and inoculum density were studied. The Hendrickx centrifuge method, developed originally for extraction of free living nematodes from soil, performed better than the method used by the Dutch Plant Protection Service.

Parameter estimation {{was carried out in}} a Bayesian framework accounting for uncertainty in the measurement. Thousands of agricultural landscapes were generated under agronomic specifications dealt with as constraint satisfaction problems. Population dynamics was simulated on each landscape with the fitted reaction-diffusion model mentioned above, and two metrics of abundances allowed the assessment of the regulation performance of the landscape spatial arrangements. One metric is a mean field performance criterion assessing the regulation performance from the landscape composition only, the other is a spatial performance metric assessing the performance resulting from the whole landscape spatial configuration. The former is computed with a non-spatialised form of the population dynamics model, the latter results from the reaction-diffusion model of the population dynamics. Comparing these metrics enabled to quantify the impact of spatial arrangements, hence allowing arrangements proposals. This framework was applied to the case study of a ground beetle species involved in the biological regulation of weeds. The arrangement proposals abides by the productive agronomic constraint that is the landscape composition, while they allow for significant habitat quality enhancement (or deterioration) for the beneficial organism (or a pest). Minor adaptations of our integrated data-driven approach would suit numerous situations ranging from the provision of enhanced ecosystem services to land management for conservation...|$|R

The ever-changing focus on environmental protection, endangered species considerations, occupational health and safety, and animal rights have put vertebrate pest control operators in the precarious position of correctly interpreting the steady stream of laws and regulations passed by government. The consequences of failing to stay abreast of these changing regulations and correctly interpreting them can lead to very costly fines and possible imprisonment. Maintaining close contact with the many agencies that <b>regulate</b> the <b>pest</b> control industry and their enforcement personnel is essential to navigating and promoting a successful, long-term business in today 2 ̆ 7 s hostile, anti-business environment...|$|R
