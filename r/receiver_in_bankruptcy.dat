60|$|During May 1905 {{the play}} was {{produced}} in England {{for the first time}} at a private performance by the New Stage Club. No one present will have forgotten the extraordinary tension of the audience on that occasion, those who disliked the play and its author being hypnotised by the extraordinary power of Mr. Robert Farquharson's Herod, one of the finest pieces of acting ever seen in this country. My friends the dramatic critics (and many of them are personal friends) fell on Salome with all the vigour of their predecessors twelve years before. Unaware of what was taking place in Germany, they spoke of the play as having been 'dragged from obscurity.' The Official <b>Receiver</b> <b>in</b> <b>Bankruptcy</b> and myself were, however, better informed. And much pleasure has been derived from reading those criticisms, all carefully preserved along with the list of receipts which were simultaneously pouring in from the German performances. To do the critics justice they never withdrew any of their printed opinions, which were all trotted out again when {{the play was}} produced privately for the second time in England by the Literary Theatre Society in 1906. In the Speaker of July 14th, 1906, however, some of the iterated misrepresentations of fact were corrected. No attempt was made to controvert the opinion of an ignorant critic: his veracity only was impugned. The powers of vaticination possessed by such judges of drama can be fairly tested in the career of Salome on the European stage, apart from the opera. In an introduction to the English translation published by Mr. John Lane it is pointed out that Wilde's confusion of Herod Antipas (Matt. xiv. 1) with Herod the Great (Matt. ii. 1) and Herod Agrippa I. (Acts xii. 23) is intentional, and follows a mediaeval convention. There is no attempt at historical accuracy or archaeological exactness. Those who saw the marvellous decor of Mr. Charles Ricketts at the second English production can form a complete idea of what Wilde intended in that respect; although the stage management was clumsy and amateurish. The great opera of Richard Strauss does not fall within my province; but the fag ends of its popularity on the Continent have been imported here oddly enough through the agency of the Palace Theatre, where Salome was originally to have been performed. Of a young lady's dancing, or of that of her rivals, I am not qualified to speak. I note merely that the critics who objected to the horror of one incident in the drama lost all self-control on seeing that incident repeated in dumb show and accompanied by fescennine corybantics. Except in 'name and borrowed notoriety' the music-hall sensation has no relation whatever to the drama which so profoundly moved the whole of Europe and the greatest living musician. The adjectives of contumely are easily transmuted into epithets of adulation, when a prominent ecclesiastic succumbs, like King Herod, to the fascination of a dancer.|$|E

Bank records later revealed that he withdrew $20,000 shortly before taking up the position in April 1930 at the relatively young age of 41. This caused suspicion that a payment to Tammany Hall politicians had secured his appointment. While acting as official <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> a <b>bankruptcy,</b> Crater sold a property at {{a tiny fraction of}} the $3 million that the city paid to get it back shortly afterward. The huge profit generated in the transaction later caused speculation that he had been killed in a dispute over the money made on a corrupt scheme, although no evidence of corruption was ever found.|$|R
50|$|Escheat {{can still}} occur in England and Wales, {{if a person}} is made {{bankrupt}} or a corporation is liquidated. Usually this means that all the property held by that person is 'vested in' (transferred to) the Official <b>Receiver</b> or Trustee <b>in</b> <b>Bankruptcy.</b> However, it is open to the Receiver or Trustee to refuse to accept that property by disclaiming it. It is relatively common for a trustee <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> to disclaim freehold property which may give rise to a liability, for example the common parts of a block of flats owned by the bankrupt would ordinarily pass to the trustee to be realised in order to pay his debts, but the property may give the landlord an obligation to spend money for the benefit of lessees of the flats. The bankruptcy of the original owner means that the freehold is no longer the bankrupt's legal property, and the disclaimer destroys the freehold estate, so that the land ceases to be owned by anyone and effectively escheats to become land held by the Crown in demesne. This situation affects a few hundred properties each year.|$|R

40|$|It {{is open to}} the United States Congress {{under its}} {{constitutional}} authority to create separate bankruptcy courts. Instead of doing so, Congress has directed United States district courts to serve as bankruptcy courts on a part-time basis. It also is within the congressional prerogative to confer upon the chosen bankruptcy courts exclusive jurisdiction over all controversies arising under the Bankruptcy Act. But that jurisdiction has been fractionated, with some reserved to bankruptcy courts and the balance distributed to two kinds of nonbankruptcy courts, namely United States district courts sitting as ordinary federal courts and state courts. Jurisdiction may be classified as either plenary or summary. Summary jurisdiction is the power to adjudicate controversies in summary proceedings. Plenary jurisdiction is comparable judicial power to adjudicate in plenary proceedings—that is, an ordinary suit at law or in equity in which the trustee or <b>receiver</b> <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> happens to be a party. Bankruptcy courts exercise plenary jurisdiction in a few instances, but practically all of their cases involve summary jurisdiction. Nonbankruptcy courts exercise plenary jurisdiction.

It does not deal with summary jurisdiction in reorganizations, arrangements, or other rehabilitative proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act.

As a coalescence of procedure and jurisdiction, summary jurisdiction has several perplexing aspects...|$|E
5000|$|A trustee <b>in</b> <b>bankruptcy</b> must {{be either}} an Official Receiver (a civil servant) or a {{licensed}} insolvency practitioner.
