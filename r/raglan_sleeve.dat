40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the differences of body compensation image on variations in the shoulder height and width of power shoulder <b>raglan</b> <b>sleeve</b> jacket. Nine samples were examined: 3 variations of the shoulder height and 3 variations of the shoulder width. The data was evaluated by 123 fashion design majors. The results were as follows; as a result of analyzing the body compensation image according to changes in the shoulder height and width of power shoulder <b>raglan</b> <b>sleeve</b> jacket, five factors were selected; the shoulder compensation factor, the bust compensation factor, the waist compensation factor, the arm compensation factor and the neck compensation factor. Among these factors, the shoulder compensation factor is the most important factor. Examining the major effect of the body compensation image based on changes in the shoulder height and width of power shoulder <b>raglan</b> <b>sleeve</b> jacket, it had an independent influence on factors about waist, neck, shoulder and arm compensation except a factor about bust compensation, had an influence on interacting effect of factors about shoulder, bust, waist, arm compensation, and it had no influence on interacting effect of a factor about neck compensation. This shows that the shoulder height has larger effect on neck compensation image than the shoulder width in power shoulder <b>raglan</b> <b>sleeve</b> jacket...|$|E

2500|$|A typical {{trench coat}} is a ten-buttoned, {{double-breasted}} long coat made with tan, black, khaki, or beige fabric. Trench coats often have cuff straps, <b>raglan</b> <b>sleeves,</b> shoulder straps and a belt. The trench coat was typically worn as a windbreaker or as a rain jacket, {{and not for}} protection from the cold in winter or snowy conditions (although many come with removable wool liners for additional warmth, they are usually not as warm as an overcoat). [...] Period advertisements from World War I reveal that the trench coat was sized to wear over the British Warm, to offer water protection when the temperature was cold enough to require the heavier coat, which explains the traditionally generous sizing of trench coats; however, makers {{in recent years have}} resized trench coats downwards to conform more closely to overcoat sizing, as the two coats, trench and overcoat, would rarely if at all be worn together today.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1967 This {{study was}} {{developed}} (1) {{to compare the}} durability and comfort of stretch and nonstretch in certain selected denim and gingham fabrics, (2) to test specific designs as to their self-help features and (3) to test special features in the designs which might be adapted easily to ready-made clothing for handicapped children. Two shirt designs and two trouser designs were developed for boys who wore leg braces, had limited finger coordination and had varying degrees of deformity in the shoulders. These designs were then constructed into 16 shirts from woven stretch and nonstretch gingham and 16 pairs of trousers from woven stretch and nonstretch denim. Eight boys, {{ranging in age from}} five to 12 years, were selected from the Children's Hospital School in Eugene, Oregon. Each boy had two outfits of the same design, one of stretch fabric and the other of nonstretch. Each outfit was worn once a week for a total of 12 wearings. All garments were laundered after each wearing by a selected laundress who followed a set procedure. The designs and special features were evaluated by two therapists and the mothers of the eight subjects during interviews with the writer. The writer also held discussions with the children. The fabrics were evaluated by the laundress and the writer by examinations of the garments after each laundering. From these evaluations the following results were apparent: 1. The woven stretch fabrics had better abrasion resistance than the nonstretch when worn over corrective appliances and retained their color and dimensional stability. 2. A pull-over style shirt with a dickey and <b>raglan</b> <b>sleeves</b> was desirable for boys who could raise their arms but had little finger coordination. 3. A shirt with a front opening with Velcro fasteners was satisfactory for boys who had limited finger coordination and could not raise their arms. 4. <b>Raglan</b> <b>sleeves</b> in shirts were desirable for boys with poor coordination and deformed shoulders. 5. Elastic at the waistband of trousers was desirable for those who needed larger trousers to fit over leg braces and pelvic bands. 6. A leg opening closed with a zipper or Velcro was desirable in trousers worn over leg braces...|$|R
