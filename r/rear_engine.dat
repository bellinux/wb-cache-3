50|$|Malaxa had an {{air-cooled}} 3-cylinder 2-strokes <b>rear</b> radial <b>engine,</b> <b>rear</b> {{wheel drive}} (RR layout), and {{was capable of}} developing 30-35 bhp. The top speed was 105-120 km/h and the gas mileage was 10 l/100 km.|$|R
25|$|The {{prototype}} first flew on 30 May 1939 {{powered by}} two Walter Sagitta I-SR air cooled vee piston engines. The trial flights identified {{problems with the}} cooling of the <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> and general engine performance. It was proposed to use Rolls-Royce or Daimler-Benz engines in the production aircraft. Concerns were also raised about the pilot clearing the rear propeller {{if he had to}} bail out and an ejector seat was studied. As a provisional solution, rails were put {{on both sides of the}} forward fuselage for the Fokker test pilot, Gerben Sonderman, to use to bail out in an emergency. The aircraft was flown 11 times for a total flight time of less than four hours. The rear fuselage paneling was modified significantly before the last few flights in an attempt to address chronic <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> cooling problems. On the 11th flight in April, the undercarriage was damaged, and the programme was abandoned in May 1940 when the German forces invaded the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1930s, Stout in {{co-operation}} with L.B. Kalb of Continental Motors, a major {{manufacture of}} lightweight air cooled aircraft engines, {{and did some}} extensive research and pre-production development into <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> drive automobiles which were powered by aircraft engines. Stout even commissioned the well known Dutch auto designer John Tjaarda to design some streamlined car bodies, although none of the car designs ever reached production.|$|E
25|$|In {{many ways}} the car was a typical example of its time, with a <b>rear</b> <b>engine,</b> front radiator, inboard front {{suspension}} and a monocoque chassis. In fact the car was Cooper's first monocoque chassis, although by this time such an arrangement had already become standard in Formula 1, having been pioneered by the Lotus 25 four years earlier. The T81 made its race debut in the 1966 Syracuse Grand Prix.|$|E

25|$|The next model {{produced}} by TVR was the Grantura Mark 1, which used a fastback-style body over the existing chassis design (with the same trailing-arm independent suspension front and <b>rear.)</b> <b>Engine</b> options included the Ford 100E sidevalve (normally aspirated or supercharged), the Ford 105E OHV unit, two different Coventry Climax units, or the MGA's BMC B-series. The {{interior of the}} Grantura was cramped, with the short doors and 17"-diameter steering wheel proving impediments to ingress. Climax-powered cars would be finished with a leather interior, while cars with the lower-specification engines were trimmed with vinyl.|$|E
25|$|Ob'yekt 914 - {{experimental}} IFV. This {{vehicle was}} developed in the early 1960s by a design team led by I. V. Gavalov at the Volgograd Tractor Works (VTZ) and the prototype was ready for trials in 1964. The Ob.914 was armed with two 7.62mm PKT general-purpose machine guns mounted in the hull {{on either side of the}} driver. It had a crew of two and could transport up to eight fully equipped soldiers (two of whom operated the PKTs). Its combat weight was 14.4 tons. After a series of trials in 1964, the Ob.765 was selected to become the BMP-1 due mostly to the <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> design which obliged the infantry to mount and dismount through the single door in the rear of the right hand side of the vehicle and roof hatches. It was also felt that the Ob.765 had a better overall layout.|$|E

50|$|Cars with <b>rear</b> <b>engines,</b> {{such as the}} Volkswagen Beetle and {{the early}} Porsches, {{necessarily}} have no radiator grilles in front, and so have horn grilles placed below their headlights. Some motor scooters have this feature as well, placed below the handlebars. Their horn grilles may be made of cheap plastic. These vehicles and the cheaper cars have only one horn.|$|R
50|$|The Janémian was a French {{automobile}} manufactured from 1920 until 1923. Built by a M.

500|$|The Mogador-class ships {{retained}} the unit arrangement of their propulsion spaces used in earlier contre-torpilleurs. They used a new high-pressure Indret boiler rated at [...] While this gave more power for its weight and size, {{it proved to}} be fragile and difficult to maintain. Each set of Rateau-Bretagne geared turbines was rated at [...] and consisted of four main turbines, a high-pressure, a medium-pressure and two low-pressure with a reversing turbine in each of the main low-pressure turbine cases. There were also two small cruise turbines operating in parallel in each engine room. At low speeds, steam was directed to the cruise turbines, but at higher speeds it was diverted to the high-pressure turbine. At [...] the cruise turbines were decoupled entirely using a Vulcan clutch. This didn't work properly and several ship's captains recommended that the cruise turbines be deleted from future classes entirely. Each of the two shafts was driven by single reduction gearing. The port shaft was driven by the <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> room and was significantly shorter than the starboard shaft which was driven by the forward engine room. This caused a significant disparity between the turning circle, depending on which direction the ship was turning.|$|E
2500|$|The engines were {{connected}} to a common gearbox that was mounted in the nose. The <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> {{was connected to the}} nose-mounted gearbox by a long drive shaft similar to the American Bell P-39 Airacobra. [...] The gearbox did not combine the power output of the two engines. [...] Instead, the <b>rear</b> <b>engine</b> drove the forward controllable-pitch propeller, while the front engine independently drove the rearward fixed-pitch propeller.|$|E
