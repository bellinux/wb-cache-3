40|$|In this paper, {{we examine}} <b>the</b> price {{dynamics}} <b>of</b> on-line art auctions of modern Indian art using functional data analysis. The purpose {{here is not}} just to understand what determines <b>the</b> final prices <b>of</b> art objects, but also the price movement during <b>the</b> entire <b>auction.</b> We identify several factors, such as artist characteristics (established or emerging artist; prior sales history), art characteristics (size; painting medium [...] canvas or paper), competition characteristics (current number of bidders; current number of bids) and auction design characteristics (opening bid; position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lot in <b>the</b> <b>auction),</b> that explain <b>the</b> dynamics <b>of</b> price movement in an on-line art auction. We find that the effects on price vary over <b>the</b> duration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction,</b> with some <b>of</b> these effects being stronger at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> (such as <b>the</b> opening bid and historical prices realized). In some cases, <b>the</b> rate <b>of</b> change in prices (velocity) increases at <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction</b> (for canvas paintings and paintings by established artists). Our analysis suggests that the opening bid is positively related to on-line auction price levels <b>of</b> art at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction,</b> but its effect declines toward <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> <b>The</b> order in which the lots appear in an art auction is negatively related to the current price level, with this relationship decreasing toward <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> This implies that lots that appear earlier have higher current prices during <b>the</b> early part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction,</b> but that effect diminishes by <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Established artists show a positive relationship with the price level at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Reputation or popularity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artists and their investment potential as assessed by previous history of sales are positively related to the price levels at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> <b>The</b> medium (canvas or paper) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting does not show any relationship with art auction price levels, but <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> <b>the</b> painting is negatively related to the current price during <b>the</b> early part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>auction.</b> Important implications for auction design are drawn from the analysis.
