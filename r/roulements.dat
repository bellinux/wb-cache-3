50|$|<b>Roulement</b> is a {{term used}} by the British Army to signify major combat units (usually {{battalion}} strength) that are deployed on short tours of duty, normally for six months. It is also used in the wider British Military to mean the deployment of a strength of personnel on continuing operations. Translate from the French Language, <b>roulement</b> means rolling.|$|R

50|$|Viking {{has been}} {{deployed}} operationally with British Forces in southern Afghanistan, supporting both 3 Cdo Bde and other <b>roulements.</b> The {{need for the}} RMASG came about because the Viking was so successful with 3 Cdo Bde on Op Herrick 5 that the incoming forces on Op Herrick 6 requested that the Vikings stay on creating a problem as the Army has no Viking trained drivers. The solution was the RMASG, an expanded unit that could continue to operate the Viking for future <b>roulements,</b> {{this led to the}} drivers of the RMASG having one of the highest operational tempos in the forces.|$|E
50|$|In 2003, 9,500 reservists, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them from the Reserve, were mobilised to take part in Operation TELIC, the invasion of Iraq; in contrast only some 420 Regular Reservists were called-up. Approximately 1,200 members of the Army Reserve deployed annually on tours of duty in Iraq, Operation HERRICK in Afghanistan and elsewhere, normally on six month-long <b>roulements.</b> They cannot be used in operations for more than twelve months in any three-year period - making most of those who have already served ineligible for call up for two years afterwards, although reservists may choose to volunteer for additional deployments.|$|E

50|$|In {{the year}} 2004, NTN Mie Corporation and Shangzhou NTN-Guangyang Corporation were formed for bearing {{fabrication}} while Nagano Works, Kuwana Works, Iwata Works, and Okayama Works earned ISO/TS16949 and ISO9001 certifications. Next year, NTN Kamiina Corporation and NTN's General Research & Development Center (Iwata) were formed domestically while NTN Investment Corporation (China), NTN-NIDEC (Thailand) and NTN Manufacturing India were formed abroad. The year after, in 2006, NTN Corporation made two grand investments. These investments included infusions into IFA-Antriebstechnik GmbH, {{a producer of}} constant velocity joints in IFA Group as well as SNR <b>Roulements,</b> a sub-tier of Renault (which became part of NTN Corporation in 2008). During that same year, NTN Fukuroi Corporation became the company's third local factory for constant velocity joints.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dawn of a}} {{new century}} saw a return to active service for the squadron. Once again {{operating}} in a field squadron role, it reformed at RAF Honington in 2001 before moving to RAF Lossiemouth. It was not long before war beckoned again and the squadron was deployed in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the invasion the squadron had several <b>roulements</b> back in the region. The squadron deployed three times to Afghanistan; twice to Kandahar Airfield and once to Camp Bastion. Whilst on Force Protection (FP) duties at Kandahar, the squadron suffered a casualty in Senior Aircraftman Christopher Bridge, who was killed when the vehicle he was travelling in struck an IED. The squadron was on FP duties at Camp Bastion when the Taliban launched an attack on the base popularly known as [...] "The Battle of Bastion". This involved squadron personnel actively engaging and repelling enemy forces as part of a wider force including other UK forces and the US Marines. Some weeks after the attack, controversy raged when images of 51 squadron personnel were released showing them kneeling next to dead Taliban fighters with their thumbs up.Most recently, 20 personnel from the Regiment deployed in support of Operation Shader.|$|E

50|$|The British Army has {{historically}} deployed infantry battalions for 6-month and 24-month <b>roulement</b> tours of Northern Ireland. Other Corps {{such as the}} Royal Armoured Corps (R.A.C.), when being used as infantry are deployed only on 4-month tours. During Operation Banner, this was {{more to do with}} the cost of re-training back to role than any operational reason. An R.A.C. crewman cost an estimated £500,000 to train and skills were lost during any longer tour. Royal Marine commando battalions and Royal Artillery serving as infantry in Northern Ireland are also <b>roulement</b> units.|$|R
