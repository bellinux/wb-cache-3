25|$|The {{weather is}} {{reported}} every half-hour during the program's first three hours, though since Al Roker {{took over as}} weather reporter, an interview is conducted by him {{in place of the}} national weather forecast at least once during the show, leaving only the local weather inserts by NBC stations. Today weather <b>reporters</b> <b>have</b> included Bob Ryan (1978–1980); Willard Scott (1980–1996); and Al Roker (1996–present). Until Ryan's hiring, no one on the show had practical experience or academic credentials in meteorology. Since NBC's purchase of The Weather Channel in 2008, personnel from that network frequently participate in Today forecast segments, at the site of a weather event or from the cable channel's suburban Atlanta headquarters, or as a fill-in for Roker.|$|E
25|$|The {{lockdown}} {{resulted in}} a heated debate about section 44. The section was raised {{as an example of}} the junta's illegitimacy and unjust means, by the temple and many other critics. While proponents pointed out that all would be finished if Luang Por Dhammajayo only gave himself over to acknowledge the charges, critics pointed out that Luang Por Dhammajayo would be imprisoned and defrocked if brought into custody. News reporters compared the temple's resistance with the Burmese Saffron Revolution in 2007, some reporters expecting defeat soon, others a new opposition movement. Many <b>reporters</b> <b>have</b> also questioned the practicality of using section 44 and many resources to arrest one person for acknowledging a charge of a non-violent crime. It has been pointed out that it is more viable to try Luang Por Dhammajayo in absentia to determine guilt first.|$|E

Some <b>reporters</b> <b>have</b> said they love it and some don't. I came to Australia for my fans". The negative media attention continued after her show in Melbourne when it was alleged that fans had placed tickets for the remaining Australian shows on sale on the online shopping website eBay, for as little as 99 cents. However, Dainty said that the holders of the tickets were not Spears's fans, stating [...] "They're just profiteers.

500|$|In September 2014, Rob Walker of Yahoo! called PewDiePie's {{popularity}} [...] "insane", writing, that it [...] "strikes me as {{considerably more}} curious — I mean, {{you know who}} Rihanna is, but would you recognise this kid if he were standing in line behind you at the bank?" [...] Walker, among other reporters and some casual gamers, have questioned the reasons for his popularity, while other <b>reporters</b> <b>have</b> criticised his rise in notability. Walker commented on PewDiePie's interaction with his audience, writing, [...] "While he can be raucous and crude, it always comes across as genuine. He constantly addresses his audience as a bunch of peer-like friends, as opposed to distant, genuflecting fans. He's certainly {{more than willing to}} make fun of himself in the process." [...] In 2015, The Verge wrote, [...] "Love it or hate it, his success — like so many other YouTube personalities — isn't just in playing games but actually connecting and talking directly to an audience. No agent, press release, or any other intermediary. He just hit record." [...] He refers to his fan base as the [...] "Bro Army" [...] and addresses his audience as [...] "bros". On this, Walker wrote, [...] "Profanity aside, it's a bummer that his persona includes constant references to his viewers as [...] "bros," [...] and that he's loose with words like [...] "bitch" [...] when his gaming adventures lead him into contact with female villain characters. Given how smart this guy clearly is when he speaks directly, I suspect he could modify his demeanor in a way that remained engaging to a young fan base but somehow contributed to improving gamer-land’s sometimes disturbingly bro-centric attitude." [...] However, both Walker and Reed have commented on PewDiePie's intelligence, with Reed opining, [...] "He's much more thoughtful and self-aware than he seems in many of his videos." ...|$|E
