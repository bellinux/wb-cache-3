40|$|BACKGROUND : Rest tremor is a {{hallmark}} of Parkinson's disease (PD), but its pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. Nigro-striatal dopamine deficiency correlates best with bradykinesia, but not with tremor. Oscillating neurons in one or multiple localizations within the basal gangliathalamo- cortical loop may cause <b>rest</b> <b>tremor,</b> and an active contribution of the cerebellum and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections has been postulated. OBJECTIVE : To compare the pattern of grey matter volume in PD patients with and without tremor to identify structural correlates of <b>rest</b> <b>tremor.</b> METHODS : Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of a high-resolution 3 Tesla, T 1 -weighted MR images, pre-processed according to an optimized protocol using SPM 2, was performed in 24 patients with mild to moderate PD comparing local grey matter volume in patients with (n = 14) and without <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> (n = 10). RESULTS : Grey matter volume is decreased in the right quadrangular lobe and declive of the cerebellum in PD with tremor compared to those without (PFDR < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate {{for the first time}} morphological changes in the cerebellum in PD patients with <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> and highlight the involvement of the cerebellum and cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit in the pathogenesis of parkinsonian <b>rest</b> <b>tremor...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1868, French {{neurologist}} Jean-Martin Charcot first {{characterized the}} distinction between multiple sclerosis (MS), with its resulting intention tremor, and the <b>resting</b> <b>tremor</b> characteristic of Parkinson's disease.

50|$|Clinical {{features}} that distinguish Parkinson-plus syndromes from idiopathic PD include symmetrical onset, {{a lack of}} or irregular <b>resting</b> <b>tremor,</b> and a reduced response to dopaminergic drugs (including levodopa). Additional features include bradykinesia, early-onset postural instability, increased rigidity in axial muscles, dysautonomia, alien limb syndrome, supranuclear gaze palsy, apraxia, involvement of the cerebellum including the pyramidal cells, {{and in some instances}} significant cognitive impairment.|$|E
40|$|Background: Benign tremulous parkinsonism (BTP) is {{a tremor}} {{dominant}} syndrome characterized by mild, levodopa-resistant parkinsonism with limited disability or progression.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} whether functional activation or inhibition of the cerebellum by {{transcranial magnetic stimulation}} modulates <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease. Background: Rest tremor in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease (PD) is disabling and responds often incompletely to conventional therapy. The pathogenesis remains largely unknown and therapeutic alternatives are needed. Functional imaging, neurophysiology and structural studies, and stereotactic surgery point to an involvement of the cerebellum and the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway in generation of Parkinsonian tremor, but the precise nature of the functional disturbance remains unknown. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled, cross-over study design, 15 PD patients with <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> underwent single sessions of continuous TBS (cTBS, inhibitory), intermittent (iTBS, excitatory) and sham stimulation of both cerebellar hemispheres. Assessment of <b>rest</b> <b>tremor,</b> motor function and neurophysiology were performed before and after each intervention including a 14 -day monitoring of tremor and motor activity. Results: Continuous TBS, intermittent TBS and sham stimulation of the cerebellum had no effects on tremor and motor performance and failed to restore cerebello-cortical inhibition in Parkinson 2 ̆ 7 s disease.

50|$|Usually the {{diagnosis}} is established on clinical grounds. Tremors can start at any age, from birth through advanced ages (senile tremor). Any voluntary muscle in the body may be affected, although the tremor is most commonly seen in the hands and arms and slightly less commonly in the neck (causing the person's head to shake), tongue, and legs. A <b>resting</b> <b>tremor</b> of the hands is sometimes present. Tremor occurring in the legs might be diagnosable as orthostatic tremor.|$|E

Often the two symptoms coexist.The parkinsonian features of x-linked dystonia parkinsonism include festinating gait, bradykinesia, blepharospasm, and postural instability.

40|$|OBJECTIVE—To characterise {{postural}} tremors {{in patients}} with Parkinson's disease. Rest tremor is a well recognised cardinal symptom of Parkinson's disease, but postural tremors associated with the disease may cause more disability than the more typical <b>rest</b> <b>tremor.</b> Postural tremor of Parkinson's disease {{has been attributed to}} enhanced physiological tremor, clonus, or coexistent essential tremor. It is postulated that one type of postural tremor in Parkinson's disease represents a <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> that re-emerges after a variable delay while maintaining posture, hence "re-emergent tremor".  METHODS—Accelerometry, peak frequency, peak frequency amplitude, root mean square (RMS) amplitude, and latency were determined in 18 patients (mean age: 63. 2 (SD 9. 8) years) with Parkinson's disease who had clinically evident postural tremor, 20 (mean age: 66. 9 (SD 5. 8) years) with typical essential tremor, and seven (mean age: 68. 7 (SD 15. 3) years) with the combination of pre-existing essential tremor and subsequent Parkinson's disease (essential tremor/Parkinson's disease). Latency, the time interval starting with the assumption of an outstretched posture and ending with the onset of postural tremor, was measured by marking the start time by a pulse produced from interrupting a beam to a photocell when the arm reached a horizontal position.  RESULTS—The latency for the re-emergent tremor (9. 37 (SD 10. 66) s), present in 12 of 18 patients with Parkinson's disease, was significantly (p< 0. 0005) longer than the latency for postural tremor of essential tremor (1. 29 s in one patient, absent in 19 others); five of seven essential tremor/Parkinson's disease patients had an observed latency (6. 57 (SD 8. 23 s) which was also significantly (p< 0. 005) longer than that for essential tremor. There was no difference in the mean tremor frequency (~ 5. 5 Hz) between the re-emergent tremor and the more typical Parkinson's disease <b>rest</b> <b>tremor.</b> The amplitudes were generally higher for the postural tremor associated with Parkinson's disease compared with those of essential tremor.  CONCLUSION—These studies suggest that the re-emergent tremor of Parkinson's disease can be differentiated from the postural tremor of essential tremor and that it may share pathophysiological mechanisms with the more typical <b>rest</b> <b>tremor.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that essential tremor (ET) represents {{a risk factor for}} the development of Parkinson's disease (PD). Patients with long-standing ET who develop PD tend to have a tremor-dominant subtype. To further clarify this association, we examined patients from kindreds with autosomal dominant ET who had signs of isolated PD but did not meet criteria for overlapping ET. We identified 22 patients with PD meeting these diagnostic criteria, and 90 % (20 of 22) had tremor-predominant subtype of PD. Unilateral <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> was the presenting symptom in 15 of 22 patients, bradykinesia or rigidity in 5 of 22, and gait problems in 2 of 22. Postural tremor was relatively mild, and the severity of kinetic tremor tightly correlated with <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> (r = 0. 83, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Implantation of {{electrodes}} in the {{subthalamic nucleus}} (STN) for {{deep brain stimulation}} is a well-established method to ameliorate motor symptoms in patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD). This study investigated the pathophysiology of <b>rest</b> and postural <b>tremor</b> in PD. In 14 patients with PD, we recorded intraoperatively local field potentials (LFPs) in the STN (at different recording depths) and electromyographic signals (EMGs) of the contralateral forearm. Using coherence analysis we analysed tremor epochs both at rest and hold conditions in patients of the akinetic-rigid or of the tremor-dominant PD subtype. Data analysis revealed significant LFP-EMG coherence during periods of <b>rest</b> and postural <b>tremor.</b> However, strong differences between both tremor types were observed: local maxima (cluster) of <b>rest</b> and postural <b>tremor</b> did not match. Additionally, during <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> coherence occurred significantly more frequently at single tremor frequency than at double tremor frequency in tremor-dominant {{as well as in}} akinetic-rigid patients. In contrast, during postural tremor in patients with akinetic-rigid PD coherence was predominantly at double tremor frequency. The data suggest a specific topography of 'tremor clusters' for <b>rest</b> and postural <b>tremor.</b> Furthermore, we presume that the same tremor mechanisms exist in patients with tremor-dominant and akinetic-rigid PD, but to different degrees...|$|R

40|$|By definition, <b>rest</b> <b>tremor</b> is an {{involuntary}} oscillation occurring while the body segment is maintained at rest, fully supported against gravity. To {{look for a}} <b>rest</b> <b>tremor,</b> the patient is seated with the upper limbs relaxed and the forearms on the thighs, or the patient is lying horizontally in complete repose. Rest tremor is typically in the 3 – 6 Hz frequency range (Fig. 7. 1) and may reach high levels of severity. Rest tremor is usually asymmetrical, in general starting distally in the arms and legs. Typically, tremor in the upper limbs reminds the “pill rolling” movement. Lips and jaw can be affected, with a rhythmic clicking of teeth. Head and trunk are usually spared. Rest tremor may disappear or subside with action (posture, movement, maintaining an isometric force, exerting a specific task) and is associated with reciprocal activation in antagonistic muscles. In some cases, patients can reduce the tremor by holding one hand with the other or crossing the legs. Rest tremor often increases with mental stress (i. e. counting backwards) or contralateral motion (Froment manoeuvre). However, this feature is not specific. Rest tremor disappears during sleep, as most tremulous disorders. SCOPUS: ch. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
