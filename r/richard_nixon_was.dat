5|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Gerald Ford {{moves into}} the house across the street after Bush leaves. When {{originally}} conceived, <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> going to move in instead, though this was changed to Bob Dole following Nixon's death. The writers then decided it would be funnier if it were Ford since they believed he was the politician who best represented Homer. Keeler's first draft also included a musical number in the style of Tom Lehrer's satirical recordings, although this ended up being cut.|$|E
5|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> buried {{beside his}} wife Pat {{on the grounds}} of the Nixon Library. He was survived by his two daughters, Tricia and Julie, and four grandchildren. In keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the Nixon Library lobby from April 26 to the morning of the funeral service. Mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. At its peak, the line to pass by Nixon's casket was three miles long with an {{estimated}} 42,000 people waiting.|$|E
5|$|Born in Ely, Nevada, {{she grew}} up with her two {{brothers}} {{in what is now}} Cerritos, California, graduating from high school in 1929. She attended Fullerton Junior College and later the University of Southern California. She paid for her schooling by working multiple jobs, including pharmacy manager, typist, radiographer, and retail clerk. In 1940, she married lawyer Richard Nixon and they had two daughters. Nixon campaigned for her husband in his successful congressional campaigns of 1946 and 1948. <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> elected Vice President in the Eisenhower administration, whereupon Pat undertook many missions of goodwill with her husband and gained favorable media coverage. She assisted her husband in both his unsuccessful 1960 presidential campaign and later in his successful 1968 presidential campaign.|$|E

5|$|United States Congressman Larry McDonald from Georgia, who at {{the time}} was also the second {{president}} of the conservative John Birch Society, was on the flight. Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Senator Steve Symms of Idaho, and Representative Carroll Hubbard of Kentucky were aboard sister flight KAL 015, which flew 15 minutes behind KAL007; they were headed, along with McDonald on KAL 007, to Seoul, South Korea, in order to attend the ceremonies for the thirtieth anniversary of the U.S.–South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty. The Soviets contended former U.S. president <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> to have been seated next to Larry McDonald on KAL 007 but that the CIA warned him not to go, according to the New York Post and Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS); this was denied by Nixon.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{before the}} 1960 Presidential election, <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> alarmed {{when it was}} {{revealed}} that his brother, Donald, received a $205,000 loan from Hughes. It has long been speculated that Nixon's drive to learn what the Democrats were planning in 1972 was based in part on his belief that the Democrats knew about a later bribe that his friend Bebe Rebozo had received from Hughes after Nixon took office.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{the merits}} of these debates or claims, {{it is clear that}} the Communist {{strategy}} of attritional conflict engendered an increasing war-weariness among their American opponents, whether the pressure was applied over time or more acutely during Tet, or whether guerrilla or conventional warfare was prominent at a particular time. After 1968, the US increasingly sought to withdraw from the conflict, and the future freedom of action by US leaders such as <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> hindered by domestic anti-war opposition.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> mask <b>is</b> a mask {{with the}} {{likeness}} of <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon.</b> These <b>were</b> commercially available and quite popular in {{the waning days of}} the <b>Nixon</b> Administration.

25|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> elected {{president}} of the United States in 1968, promising to end the Vietnam War. In November 1969, the My Lai Massacre by American troops of between 347 and 504 civilians in a Vietnamese village was exposed, leading to increased public opposition in the United States to the war. The nature of the draft also changed in December 1969, with the first draft lottery since World War II. This eliminated deferments allowed in the prior draft process, affecting many college students and teachers.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{progressive}} {{leaders in}} the Republican party supported environmental protection. Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was a prominent conservationist whose policies {{eventually led to the}} creation of the National Park Service. While Republican President <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> not an environmentalist, he signed legislation to create the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970 and had a comprehensive environmental program. However, this position has changed since the 1980s and the administration of President Ronald Reagan, who labeled environmental regulations a burden on the economy. Since then Republicans have increasingly taken positions against environmental regulation.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, billionaire Walter Annenberg, former {{ambassador}} to the United Kingdom under President <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon,</b> <b>was</b> the United States' most generous living philanthropist. By 1998, Annenberg had given away more than $2 billion and {{the assets of the}} Annenberg Foundation he had established in June 1989 with $1 billion had grown to $3 billion and ranked as the 12th largest in the U.S. Every weekday from May through November, Annenberg was driven from his home in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania to his Annenberg Foundation headquarters in St. Davids, Pennsylvania, where, as its sole director, he reserved virtually every decision for himself when making grants.|$|E

25|$|Since the amendment's adoption, five {{presidents have}} served two full terms: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Jimmy Carter and George H. W. Bush sought a second term, but were defeated. <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> elected {{to a second}} term, but {{resigned}} before completing it. Lyndon B. Johnson was the only president under the amendment to be eligible to serve more than two terms in total, having served for only fourteen months following John F. Kennedy's assassination. However, Johnson withdrew from the 1968 Democratic Primary, surprising many Americans. Gerald Ford sought a full term, after serving out {{the last two years}} and five months of Nixon's second term, but was not elected.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{an option}} for prosecutors, when {{bringing}} conspiracy charges, to decline to indict {{all members of the}} conspiracy (though the existence of all members may be mentioned in an indictment). Such unindicted co-conspirators are commonly found when the identities or whereabouts of members of a conspiracy are unknown, or when the prosecution is concerned only with a particular individual among the conspirators. This is common when the target of the indictment is an elected official or an organized crime leader, and the co-conspirators are persons of little or no public importance. More famously, President <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> named as an unindicted co-conspirator by the Watergate special prosecutor, in an event leading up to his eventual resignation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> {{a popular}} {{incumbent}} president in 1972, {{as he was}} credited with achieving détente with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union. Polls showed that Nixon held a strong lead in the Republican primaries. He was challenged by two candidates, liberal Pete McCloskey from California and conservative John Ashbrook from Ohio. McCloskey ran as an anti-war candidate, while Ashbrook opposed Nixon’s détente policies towards China and the Soviet Union. In the New Hampshire primary McCloskey garnered 19.8% of the vote to Nixon’s 67.6%, with Ashbrook receiving 9.7%. Nixon won 1323 of the 1324 delegates to the Republican convention, with McCloskey receiving the vote of one delegate from New Mexico. Vice President Spiro Agnew was re-nominated by acclamation; while both the party’s moderate wing and Nixon himself had wanted to replace him with a new running-mate (the moderates favoring Nelson Rockefeller, and Nixon favoring John Connally), it was ultimately concluded {{that the loss of}} Agnew’s base of conservative supporters would be too big of a risk.|$|E

25|$|Ceaușescu was {{prepared}} {{to take a more}} decisive step in questioning Soviet policies. In the early years of his rule, he generally relaxed political pressures inside Romanian society, which led to the late 1960s and early 1970s being the most liberal decade in Socialist Romania. Gaining the public's confidence, Ceaușescu took a clear stand against the 1968 crushing of the Prague Spring by Leonid Brezhnev. After a visit from Charles de Gaulle earlier in the same year, during which the French President gave recognition to the incipient maverick, Ceaușescu's public speech in August deeply impressed the population, not only through its themes, but also because, uniquely, it was unscripted. He immediately attracted Western sympathies and backing, which lasted well beyond the 'liberal' phase of his rule; at the same time, the period brought forward the threat of armed Soviet invasion: significantly, many young men inside Romania joined the Patriotic Guards created {{on the spur of the}} moment, in order to meet the perceived threat. President <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> invited to Bucharest in 1969, which was the first visit of a United States president to a Socialist country after the start of the Cold War.|$|E
500|$|The {{number of}} media outlets {{increased}} and PR talent from wartime propaganda entered the private sector. The practice {{of public relations}} became ubiquitous to reach political, activist and corporate objectives. The development of the press into a more real-time media also led to heightened scrutiny of public relations activities and those they represent. For example, <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> criticized for [...] "doubletalk" [...] and [...] "stonewalling" [...] in his PR office's responses to the Watergate scandal.|$|E
500|$|In 1950, California Congressman <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> {{elected to}} the Senate, {{defeating}} Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas. With the six-year term secured, Nixon campaign officials discussed how to further his career. Campaign manager Murray Chotiner and campaign chairman Bernie Brennan proposed a year-round campaign {{for the next six}} years, leading up to a re-election bid in 1956. Nixon's Southern California campaign treasurer Dana Smith suggested what became known as [...] "the Fund", to be administered by himself, which would pay for Nixon's political expenses.|$|E

[...] After Nixon departed, the Hornet was brought alongside the five-ton Command Module where it was placed aboard by the ship's crane, placed on a dolly and moved next to the MQF. The Hornet sailed for Pearl Harbor where Columbia and the MQF were airlifted to the Manned Spacecraft Center.|$|E
500|$|G. Harrold Carswell was unsuccessfully {{nominated}} by Richard Nixon in 1970, and {{was convicted in}} 1976 of battery for making an [...] "unnatural and lascivious" [...] advance to a male police officer working undercover in a Florida men's room. Some therefore claim him as the only gay or bisexual person nominated to the Court thus far. If so, {{it is unlikely that}} Nixon was aware of it; White House Counsel John Dean later wrote of Carswell that [...] "hile <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> always looking for historical firsts, nominating a homosexual to the high court would not have been on his list".|$|E
500|$|Taibbi's {{work was}} {{inspired}} by Hunter S. Thompson, who had previously published Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72. Taibbi explained, [...] "What made Thompson's work on that 1972 campaign art, {{as opposed to just}} snappy periodical writing, was Thompson's obsession with Nixon. It was like the two men were linked in another dimension." [...] Taibbi contrasted his publication with Thompson's reporting from 1972, [...] "unlike previous campaigns I've covered for the magazine, 2016 had a lot in common with 1972. <b>Richard</b> <b>Nixon</b> <b>was</b> the defining monster of Thompson's era. We've now found ours in Donald Trump." ...|$|E
