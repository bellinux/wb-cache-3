50|$|A {{number of}} Streptopelia species {{are very similar}} in appearance, all having semi-collars and subdued plumage tones. The <b>ring-necked</b> <b>dove</b> is {{distinguished}} from its locally sympatric sister species, the African collared dove, by call, the paler bases of the tail feathers, and the grey rather than pink crown feathers.|$|E
50|$|The <b>ring-necked</b> <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia capicola), {{also known}} as the Cape turtle dove or half-collared dove, is a {{widespread}} and often abundant dove species in East and southern Africa. It is a mostly sedentary bird, found in a catholic variety of open habitats. Within range, its penetrating and rhythmic, three-syllabled crooning is a familiar sound at any time of the year. Its name is derived from the semi-collar of black feathers on the lower nape, a feature shared with a number of Streptopelia species. Like all doves they depend on surface water. They congregate in large flocks at waterholes in dry regions to drink and bathe.|$|E
40|$|Avian vocalizations {{function}} in mate attraction and territorial defence. Vocalizations {{can act as}} behavioural barriers and {{play an important role}} in speciation processes. Hybrid zones illustrate behavioural barriers are not always impermeable and provide a natural laboratory to examine the role of vocalizations in the causes and consequences of hybridization. This thesis examines a hybrid zone between two species of African doves: the vinaceous (Streptopelia vinacea) and <b>ring-necked</b> <b>dove</b> (S. capicola) by investigating its composition and history with molecular techniques, the mechanisms underlying the variation in dove coos and the response to hybrid signals within and outside the hybrid zone. The variation in hybrid signals and the possibility of learning which vocalizations to respond to can {{play an important role in}} facilitating further introgression between the two species.

50|$|The Barbary dove, ringed turtle <b>dove,</b> ringneck <b>dove,</b> <b>ring-necked</b> turtle <b>dove,</b> or {{ring dove}} (Streptopelia risoria) is a {{domestic}} {{member of the}} dove family (Columbidae).|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasing}} human-wildlife conflicts with birds and growing opposition to lethal techniques, nonlethal methods {{need to be}} developed to help manage bird populations. DiazaCon™ is a promising oral contraceptive that acts by directly inhibiting the conversion of desmosterol to cholesterol. Because cholesterol is essential for the production of the steroid reproductive hormones testosterone, progesterone, and estradiol, DiazaCon™ also indirectly inhibits the formation of these hormones. These hormones are essential for sperm and egg production, and the production of egg yolk precursors in the liver. Because DiazaCon™ is cleared slowly from the liver, its contraceptive effects are long-lasting. Initial research with Coturnix quail (Coturnix coturnix) helped determine DiazaCon’s mechanism of action. Further research showed efficacy in monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus) and mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos) and <b>ring-necked</b> <b>doves</b> (Streptopelia risoria) were also studied as potential candidates for DiazaCon™ contraception. Mallards and <b>ring-necked</b> <b>doves</b> were used as model species for Canada geese (Branta canadensis) and pigeons (Columba livia), respectively. DiazaCon™ application over a very short time results in long-lasting contraceptive effects, an advantage for target species, but a disadvantage for nontarget species. Care must be taken when delivering DiazaCon™ to determine what nontargets are present and how best to avoid them. Timing of delivery is also critical to ensure maximal reproductive effects, and information on the reproductive cycles of the species of interest is needed...|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of some 700 feral cattle {{within the park}} is cause for concern as they compete with wildlife for valuable forage. Larvae of the Lepidopteran Parapoynx diminutalis {{has also been a}} serious pest, and considerably inhibited the growth of Nymphoides cristatum during June-July 1986. High levels of pollutants in Ajan Bund are believed to be responsible for the increasing number of piscivorous birds seen in a dazed state and unable to fly. Fewer birds were recorded in 1984 than in previous years. Four sarus cranes and 40 <b>ring-necked</b> <b>doves</b> were found dead outside the park during 1988 and early 1989, possibly due to pesticide poisoning, and a study of the impact of pesticide use in surrounding areas on the park has been initiated in addition to studies on heavy metal contamination. Disturbance from visitors can be a cause for concern, especially during December and January when visitors come to see the cranes.|$|R
5000|$|These doves {{are usually}} found {{alone or in}} pairs, {{although}} they do form larger flocks around roosts or sources of food and water, sometimes comprising hundreds of birds. They are quite noisy in these groups, {{not only for the}} various calls they make throughout the day, or often into (mainly moonlit) nights, but also due to the loud clatter of their wings when they take flight.Their song is a loud and harsh “kuk-COORRRR-uk, ...” (sometimes interpreted as 'how's father?' or 'work harder') which they may repeat ten to forty times. Less often a repeated “wuh-ka-RROOO, ...” may be given. A raspy, snarling “kooorr”, or “knarrrrrr”, call is often given when it alights on a perch, arrives at an incubating mate or chases another <b>dove</b> away. <b>Ring-necked</b> <b>doves</b> roost in treetops during the night and forage for food on the ground by day. Peak foraging times are early morning and late afternoon, and they drink mainly in the morning. When they walk on the ground, their heads bob back and forth with each small step.|$|R
5000|$|Originally not {{conceived}} as art, this work {{began with a}} gift {{of a pair of}} <b>Ring-necked</b> Mourning <b>doves</b> and led to the design of their environment. The doves were given free rein of the artist’s studio. A bicycle wheel was hung for a perch, with an adaptation of a Zen archer’s target nailed to the floor below. The material trace of the work lay in photographs and 1969 bronze and silver casts of broken eggshells. [...] "View works" ...|$|R
40|$|A viral agent {{has been}} {{isolated}} from five fatal cases of naturally occurring inclusion body disease {{in three different}} falcon species, namely, the prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), the red-headed falcon (F. chiquera), and the peregrine falcon (F. peregrinus). The virus {{has been shown to}} possess the physical, chemical, and biological properties of a herpesvirus and has been used to reproduce inclusion body disease in the prairie falcon, merlin (F. columbarius), and American kestrel (F. sparverius). A similar disease was also produced with this virus in the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), screech owl (Otus asio), and <b>ring-necked</b> turtle <b>dove</b> (Streptopelia risoria). Serological comparison of the falcon herpesvirus with other known avian herpesviruses revealed that the virus is antigenically closely related to a pigeon herpesvirus and an owl herpesvirus while differing from the former in host range. No antigenic relationship to infectious laryngotracheitis virus, duck virus enteritis, or Marek's disease virus could be demonstrated...|$|R
5000|$|Lead shot-related {{waterfowl}} poisonings {{were first}} {{documented in the}} US in the 1880s; by 1919, the spent lead pellets from waterfowl hunting was positively identified as {{a major source of}} deaths of bottom-feeding waterfowl. [...] Once ingested, stomach acids and mechanical action cause the lead to break down and be absorbed into the body and bloodstream, resulting in death. [...] "If a bird swallows only one pellet, it usually survives, although its immune system and fertility are likely to be affected. Even low concentrations of lead {{have a negative impact on}} energy storage, which affects the ability to prepare for migration." [...] Upland game birds such as mourning <b>doves,</b> <b>ring-necked</b> pheasants, wild turkey, northern bobwhite quail and chukars can also ingest lead and thus be poisoned when they feed on seeds.|$|R
5000|$|Desert Canyon was {{the fifth}} and final phase of Discoveryland. Large red stone rocks were {{constructed}} of fabricated rock, lath and rebar over three concrete and block buildings. A concrete gun was used to build a reddish-color cement-like compound, which was then hand troweled for the rock-like appearance. As visitors followed a somewhat narrow path, they saw two exhibits. Originally they were for fennec and kit foxes, {{but over the years}} an ocelot and a coati were housed in the exhibits. Next visitors saw an aquarium housed Utah native fish species like June suckers. On top of a small mesa, angora goats and Navajo sheep lived overlooking an Anasazi cliff dwelling. Before construction on the new African Savanna started, an old angora goat and a few Navajo sheep moved into the old bighorn sheep exhibit on the south pathway. Other small glass exhibits housed Harris antelope squirrels, armadillos, a screech owl, a long-eared owl, an American kestrel, mourning <b>doves,</b> <b>ring-necked</b> pheasants, Bullock's orioles, and ravens. Desert Canyon also housed a small amphitheater. Live animal shows were held there ...|$|R
