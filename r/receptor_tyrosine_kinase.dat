25|$|Interstitial {{deletion}}s: an intra-chromosomal deletion that {{removes a}} segment of DNA from a single chromosome, thereby apposing previously distant genes. For example, cells isolated from a human astrocytoma, a type of brain tumor, {{were found to have}} a chromosomal deletion removing sequences between the Fused in Glioblastoma (FIG) gene and the <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> (ROS), producing a fusion protein (FIG-ROS). The abnormal FIG-ROS fusion protein has constitutively active kinase activity that causes oncogenic transformation (a transformation from normal cells to cancer cells).|$|E
25|$|The first cancer genome was sequenced in 2008. This study sequenced {{a typical}} acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) genome and its normal {{counterpart}} genome {{obtained from the}} same patient. The comparison revealed ten mutated genes. Two were already thought to contribute to tumor progression: an internal tandem duplication of the FLT3 <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> gene, which activates kinase signaling and {{is associated with a}} poor prognosis and a four base insertion in exon 12 of the NPM1 gene (NPMc). These mutations are found in 25-30% of AML tumors and are thought to contribute to disease progression rather than to cause it directly.|$|E
25|$|Tyrosine kinase inhibitors {{are another}} investigational drug class {{that may have}} {{applications}} in ovarian cancer. Angiogenesis inhibitors in the <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> inhibitor group, including pazopanib, cediranib, and nintedanib, have {{also been shown to}} increase progression free survival (PFS), but their benefit for overall survival has not been investigated as of 2015. Preliminary research showed that cediranib combined with platins in recurrent ovarian cancer increased the time to second recurrence by 3–4 months and increased survival by 3 months. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is being used in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in platinum-sensitive cancers with p53 mutations. Nintedanib is being researched as a potential therapy in combination with cyclophosphamide for people with recurrences.|$|E
40|$|This work unveils a {{previously}} unidentified {{function of the}} tumor suppressor pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) in inhibiting oncogenic signaling by suppressing the steady-state levels of <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> such as the EGF receptor.

25|$|The {{following}} human Gla-containing proteins ("Gla proteins") {{have been}} characterized {{to the level}} of primary structure: blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating growth arrest specific gene 6 protein (Gas6), and the four transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the function of which is at present unknown. Gas6 can function as a growth factor to activate the Axl <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> and stimulate cell proliferation or prevent apoptosis in some cells. In all cases in which their function was known, the presence of the Gla residues in these proteins turned out to be essential for functional activity.|$|E
25|$|Mutations (DNA changes) in the RET proto-oncogene, {{located on}} {{chromosome}} 10, {{lead to the}} expression of a mutated <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase</b> protein, termed RET (REarranged during Transfection). RET is involved in the regulation of cell growth and development and its germline mutation is responsible for nearly all cases of hereditary or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma. Its germline mutation may also be responsible for the development of hyperparathyroidism and pheochromocytoma. Hereditary medullary thyroid cancer is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, meaning that each child of an affected parent has a 50% probability of inheriting the mutant RET proto-oncogene from the affected parent. DNA analysis makes it possible to identify children who carry the mutant gene; surgical removal of the thyroid in children who carry the mutant gene is curative if the entire thyroid gland is removed at an early age, before there is spread of the tumor. The parathyroid tumors and pheochromocytomas are removed when they cause clinical symptomatology. Hereditary medullary thyroid carcinoma or multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2) accounts for approximately 25% of all medullary thyroid carcinomas.|$|E

2500|$|Neural crest cell {{migration}} {{occurs in a}} rostral to caudal direction without the need of a neuronal scaffold such as along a radial glial cell. For this reason the crest {{cell migration}} process is termed “free migration”. Instead of scaffolding on progenitor cells, neural crest migration {{is the result of}} repulsive guidance via EphB/EphrinB and semaphorin/neuropilin [...] signaling, interactions with the extracellular matrix, and contact inhibition with one another. While Ephrin and Eph proteins have the capacity to undergo bi-directional signaling, neural crest cell repulsion employs predominantly forward signaling to initiate a response within the receptor bearing neural crest cell. Burgeoning neural crest cells express EphB, a <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinase,</b> which binds the EphrinB transmembrane ligand expressed in the caudal half of each somite. When these two domains interact it causes receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of rhoGTPases, and eventual cytoskeletal rearrangements within the crest cells inducing them to repel. This phenomenon allows neural crest cells to funnel through the rostral portion of each somite.|$|E

Many cytoplasmic proteins regulated by such receptors contain Src-homology (SH) 2 and 3 domains, and the SH 2 - and SH 3 -containing protein Grb 2, like its homologue from Caenorhabditis elegans, Sem- 5, appears {{to play an important}} role in the control of Ras by <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> Here we show that overexpression of Grb 2 potentiates the EGF-induced activation of Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase by enhancing the rate of guanine nucleotide exchange on Ras.

40|$|AbstractProtein {{tyrosine}} phosphatases (PTPs) are key regulators in {{a variety}} of signal transduction processes. However, substrates for most PTPs have not been determined. In a previous report, we demonstrated that in a transient expression system the intracellular phosphatases PTPs 1 B and TC preferentially dephosphorylated the precursor form of several <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> In this paper we show that the dephosphorylation of kinase precursors is a specific feature of PTPs 1 B and TC that is not shared by two other intracellular PTPs, PTPH 1 or SHP- 1. By contrast, the receptor phosphatase PTPα preferentially dephosphorylated the β-subunit of the insulin receptor localized on the cell surface. The insulin receptor was a better substrate for PTPα than for other receptor type PTPs. We conclude that the intracellular PTPs 1 B and TC regulate the autophosphorylation of <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> during their posttranslational processing while receptor type PTPs regulate the mature, cell surface localized <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> © 1997 Federation of European Biochemical Societies...|$|R

40|$|Infected {{cell protein}} 0 (ICP 0) is a 775 -residue {{multifunctional}} {{herpes simplex virus}} protein associated with numerous functions related to transactivation of gene expression and repression of host defenses to infection. We report that an uncharted domain of ICP 0 located between residues 245 and 510 contains multiple SH 3 domain binding motifs similar to those required for binding to CIN 85, the Mr 85, 000 protein that interacts with Cbl. CIN 85 and Cbl are involved in endocytosis and negative regulation of numerous <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases.</b> We report that ICP 0 binds CIN 85 in a reciprocal manner and that the complexes pulled down by ICP 0 also contain Cbl. We tested the role of ICP 0 in the down-regulation of <b>receptor</b> <b>tyrosine</b> <b>kinases</b> by using epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a prototypic receptor. In transfection assays, ICP 0, {{in the absence of}} other viral genes, down-regulated EGF-dependent expression of a reporter gene (luciferase). ICP 0 also down-regulated both total and cell surface levels of EGFR in EGF-independent manner. In wild-type virus-infected cells, the surface levels of EGFR were also decreased in the absence of EGF stimulation. Stimulation by EGF enhanced the decrease in surface EGFR.
