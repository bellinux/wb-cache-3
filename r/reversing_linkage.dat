40|$|We {{investigate}} the causal links between human capital, openness through trade and FDI, {{and economic growth}} using quarterly data for Thailand over the period 1973 : 2 - 2000 : 4. A number of hypotheses are investigated including, in particular, FDI-led growth and export-led growth, {{as well as the}} <b>reverse</b> <b>linkages</b> from growth to FDI and exports. The importance of human capital is highlighted as complementary to trade and FDI inflows, underlying the importance of technology adoption. We find that, after controlling for domestic investment, government expenditure and imports, support for FDI-led growth is not as strong as export-led growth, although allowing for the joint interaction of FDI and human capital reveals a positive FDI effect above a minimum threshold of human capital, estimated to be around 4. 5 years of average secondary schooling attainment. Extending our study using multivariate causality tests conducted within a vector error correction framework, we also find significant effects of domestic investment and trade openness, providing support for import-led growth, but direct support for FDI-led growth as well as growth-led FDI is again relatively weak, reinforcing the conclusion that trade openness has played a more significant role than FDI in influencing Thai economic growth. But the results reveal a subtle role for technology transfer through the complementary effect of trade on FDI, and FDI on government expenditure, which thereby influences human capital development with spillovers onto domestic investment and growth. This leads us to argue that there is a potential role for FDI interacting with human capital in influencing the future development of the Thai economy, given its recently active policy of FDI promotion.

40|$|Core {{samples of}} coal and rock were {{obtained}} from the HQ- 1 environmental test well at the Pricetown I, Underground Coal Gasification Test Site. A comprehensive analytical program was performed to characterize the coal samples. The rocks associated with the coals are composed of clay size material containing low amounts of organic matter and hydrocarbon gas relative to the coal seams. The fine grained sediment above and below the coal seams appear to be an effective gas seal. The coals were encountered in two intervals of 1 foot and 6 feet thickness separated by 2 feet of shale. The coals are classified as high volatile A or B bituminous based on vitrinite reflectance, fixed carbon, and calorific value. Coal maceral analysis shows that the coal is heterogeneous in petrographic properties. The vitrinite group is the predominant maceral constituent. Fusinite, semi-fusinite, massive micrinite, and sporinite are present in varying amounts. The distribution of porous fusinite layers within the coal seams may be important in the <b>reverse</b> <b>linkage</b> stage of the gasification process. The coal in the bottom seam contains an average of 45. 6 standard cubic feet of free methane per ton of coal. This methane may assist in initiating the gasification process. Thermal Conductivity and Laser Thermal Diffusivity experiments were also performed on selected coal samples as well as on samples of the grout used in the instrumentation wells. While the thermal conductivity values were influenced by the tars and oils generated during the heating of the coal, the laser thermal diffusivity values were obtained at sufficiently low temperatures to minimize the influence of the tars and oils...|$|R

Moreover, the characterization of unknown metabolites is challenging, since these cannot be assigned a candidate structure by using a reference database. In this case study, integrated LC-MS/MS based plant metabolomics allows us to detect several hundred metabolites in a sample; and integrated omics analyses, e. g., large-scale <b>reverse</b> genetics, <b>linkage</b> mapping, and association mapping, provides a powerful tool for candidate structure selection or rejection.

40|$|With {{its focus}} on {{synthetic}} reactions that are highly specific and reliable, 'click' chemistry has become a valuable tool for many scientific research areas and applications. Combining the modular, covalently bonded nature of click-chemistry linkages with an ability to <b>reverse</b> these <b>linkages</b> and reuse the constituent reactants in another click reaction, however, is a feature that is not found in most click reactions.

We present examples of simple and ultrafast macromolecular functionalization, polymer-polymer linking and polymer crosslinking under ambient conditions without the need for a catalyst. Moreover, when triazolinediones are combined with indole reaction partners, the reverse reaction can also be induced at elevated temperatures, and the triazolinedione reacted with a different reaction partner, reversibly or irreversibly dependent on its exact nature. We have used this 'transclick' reaction to introduce thermoreversible links into polyurethane and polymethacrylate materials, which allows dynamic polymer-network healing, reshaping and recycling...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between the house-price {{expectations}} of mortgage lenders and the extent of subprime lending. It argues that bubble conditions in the housing market are likely to spur subprime lending, with favorable price expectations easing the default concerns of lenders and thus increasing their willingness to extend loans to risky borrowers. Since the demand created by subprime lending feeds back onto house prices, such lending also helps to fuel an emerging housing bubble. The paper, however, focuses on the <b>reverse</b> causal <b>linkage,</b> where subprime lending is a consequence rather than a cause of bubble conditions. These ideas are illustrated in a theoretical model, and empirical work tests for a connection between price expectations and the extent of subprime lending. †The views expressed in this paper {{are those of the authors}} and do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, or the Fed-eral Reserve System.

However, high-rank coals, such as anthracites, are far less permeable, making the gas production rate more limited if UCG is employed [35].

40|$|This long awaited {{second edition}} traces the {{original}} developments from the 1970 s and brings {{them up to}} date with new and previously unpublished material to give this work a new lease {{of life for the}} early twenty-first century and readers new to the topic. In the winter of 1970 - 71, Colman Altman had been finding almost exact symmetries in the computed reflection and transmission matrices for plane-stratified magnetoplasmas when symmetrically related directions of incidence were compared. At the suggestion of Kurt Suchy the complex conjugate wave fields, used to construct the eigenmode amplitudes via the mean Poynting flux densities, were replaced by the adjoint wave fields that would propagate in a medium with transposed constitutive tensors, to yield a scattering theorem – reciprocity in k-space [...] in the computer output. To prove the result analytically, one had to investigate the properties of the adjoint Maxwell system, and the two independent proofs that followed, in 1975 and 1979, proceeded according to the personal preference of each of the authors. The proof given in this volume, based on the hindsight provided by later results, is much more simple and concise. Later, when media with bianisotropic constitutive tensors were investigated, it was found that conjugate (reciprocal) media and wave fields could be formed by any orthogonal spatial mapping of those in the original problem, after media and fields were reversed in time. The result was still quite general and not limited to stratified systems. The second line of development was to find the link between reciprocity in k-space and Lorentz reciprocity involving currents and sources in physical space. This was done for plane-stratified media by applying the scattering theorem to the plane-wave spectrum of eigenmodes radiated by one current source and reaching the second source. The <b>reverse</b> <b>linkage</b> between Lorentz reciprocity and reciprocity in k-space had already been found. However, {{this was the first time}} that the results were presented in a systematic and mathematically well-defined procedure to serve as a tool for solving problems of reciprocity and scattering symmetries. The use of time reversal gives rise to problems of causality when sources are present, but when the interaction between two systems is involved the non-causal effects are irrelevant. The insight gained during these investigations enabled the authors to present many of the earlier theorems and results, both their own and those of others, in a compact and unified approach, which has been the main strength of this book. This new edition has been revised, corrected and updated where necessary to give a complete picture of this interesting topic for the present generation of scientists...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a new {{approach}} to study the linkage between science and technology. Unlike most contributions to this area we do not trace citations of scientific literature in patents but explore citations of patents in scientific literature. Our analysis is based on papers recorded in the 1996 - 2000 annual volumes of the CD-Edition of Science Citation Index (SCI) of the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) and patent data provided by the US Patent and Trademark Office. Almost 30, 000 US patents were cited by scientific research papers. We analysed the citation links by scientific fields and technological sectors. Chemistry-related subfields tended to cite patents more than other scientific area. Among technological sectors, chemical clearly dominates followed by drugs and medical patents as the most frequently cited categories. Further analyses included a country-ranking based on inventor-addresses of the cited patents, a more detailed inspection of the ten most cited patents, and an analysis of class-field transfers. The paper concludes with the suggestions for future research. One of them is to compare our 'reverse' citation data with 'regular' patent citation data within the same classification system to see whether citations occur, irrespectively of their directionality, in the same fields of science and technology.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the causes, processes {{and consequences of}} industrial specialization. Specifically, three sets of questions are addressed. First, how do trade and financial openness affect industrial specialization across countries? Second, how does trade openness affect industrial composition across industries and how do firm-level dynamics play an important role? Third, what are the macroeconomic consequences of specialization? In particular, how does specialization matter for economic growth and cross-border portfolio investments? Chapter 2 investigates the roles of trade and financial openness, separately and in conjunction {{with each other in}} affecting industrial specialization. The results show that both trade and financial openness have a positive relationship with industrial specialization. In addition, the effect of trade (financial) openness on specialization is enhanced by the level of financial (trade) openness, suggesting that they are complementary in their effects on specialization. Chapter 3 takes a closer look at which industries are driving the trade-specialization nexus, and how firm-level dynamics play a critical role. I argue and find that industries need 'room to move' in order for increasing trade openness to translate into increased specialization. The true drivers of the trade-specialization nexus are productive firms, who benefit from the increase in trade-openness and can appropriate resources from less productive firms. This causes the industry in which they operate to expand, {{at the expense of other}} industries, in which there is no room to make such moves. In order words, the intra-industry potential for reallocation determines whether there is a trade-specialization nexus. While chapters 2 and 3 focus on the determinants and processes of industrial specialization, chapters 4 and 5 examine its macroeconomic consequences. Chapter 4 first develops a proxy for the maturity of a country's export bundle based on the product life cycle theory. Then, the results show that the effect of export maturity on growth is very different across three clusters of countries. In the most developed cluster, countries tend to grow more rapidly when they export new and innovative products that are in an early stage of the product life cycle. In contrast, a cluster of emerging countries appears to grow faster by exporting more mature products that are in the later stages of their life cycle. Finally, the effect of export maturity on growth seems insignificant in the cluster of developing countries. While chapter 2 has established the finding that financial openness promotes specialization through risk-sharing, chapter 5 investigates the <b>reverse</b> <b>linkage</b> by examining the effects of ongoing changes in industrial structure on cross-border portfolio investments in a bilateral setting. The results reveal a strong negative relationship between structure dissimilarity and bilateral portfolio investments, indicating that investors tilt their foreign portfolio towards countries with similar industrial structures. The diversification motive therefore does not seem to play a role. These finds suggest that investors have a preference for familiarity when investing abroad. In other words, they prefer to invest in similar countr...|$|R

This model gave the values of various {{parameters}} such as water influx, percent devolatilization, percent gasification, amount of coal affected, thermal efficiency, etc., for the various phases of the test. Both hourly and daily values of the test data were used. At certain times, there was air loss to the coal seam or air gain from the coal seam as related to the underground reactor. Mass balances are modified accordingly. Realistic pyrolysis temperatures have been chosen for the different phases of the test based on the thermocouple responses. The nitrogen and argon balances gave similar results. The mass balance results showed that approximately 702 tons of coal was affected during the test. Approximately 232 tons of coal was completely gasified.
