At the time of German unification 1990, infrastructure in East Germany was in a very bad condition. After {{more than ten years}} of rebuilding, most of the remaining need for infrastructure investments is probably in the road sector. Therefore, the planned new motorway connections to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania as well as to Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia will have to be completed and, furthermore, numerous defects of <b>regional</b> and <b>local</b> <b>road</b> networks will continuously have to be repaired. In the railway sector, the high-speed route Nuremberg-Erfurt as well as improvements in the existing network (as far as they are justified by the prospective transport demand) are on the agenda. The least need for investments is left in the telecommunications and – after realization of current investment plans – in the airport sectors.

40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of the network of motorways in Azerbaijan, the organization of operation and maintenance of motorways is still not fully modernized. Currently, more than sixty regional units across the country are responsible for the maintenance of the entire road network. These units carry out their duties equally on main, <b>regional</b> and <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> The modern way of operation of motorways requires a different approach with the specific procedures and regulation of relations for this type of network. Based on existing organization and capacity, as well as institutional changes/strengthening of the Agency for State Roads, it was found that operators from the public sector can provide maintenance of motorways in a certain period. Such a proposal must be accompanied by organizational changes in terms of reduction of existing units through the establishment of specialized regional units for maintenance of motorways that will be responsible for longer sections/sectors of about 200 - 300 km. This paper presents an analysis of the necessary capacity to maintain the motorway network in Azerbaijan, and estimate of the total costs for setting up new units for maintenance of motorways...|$|R
40|$|More {{than half}} the {{travellers}} use travel information and can therefore {{be used as a}} policy instrument to affect travel behaviour of individuals. Developing a successful travel information services requires several prerequisites. For recreational travel, transport data on the <b>regional</b> and <b>local</b> <b>roads</b> is of utmost importance. This information is currently not available in the Netherlands. Consequently, additional effort should be directed to acquire the necessary transport data and to stimulate travel information services that support door-to-door trips. Furthermore, the effect of external factors on the use of travel information should be taken into account when developing new information services. As the experience with public transport can be transferred less easily to other trips relative to experience with car travel, public transport users use more travel information than car users. As a consequence additional attention should be given to increase the public transport information; not only on travel websites but also on the destination websites. Besides changing travel behaviour, travel information enhances the quality of the trip. Travellers may find this aspect more important than changing their travel behaviour. To increase the perception of trip quality, the government should increase its effort to stimulate the distribution of individual travel information, for all trip motives...|$|R
40|$|The {{implementation}} of effective and cost-efficient programmes such as lowcost road and traffic engineering measures (LCM) cannot {{be viewed as}} an activity with a `high political profile'. LCMs are taken almost invisibly. However, if these measures are shown to be highly effective, then the interest of politicians and bureaucracy could be stimulated, the more when significant results are feasible at a low cost. This observation has important implications for the organisation and procedures used to implement LCM. In this context, the following points deserve special attention. Firstly, the problem that while <b>regional</b> and <b>local</b> <b>road</b> authorities might have the capacity to apply LCM, they do not have enough expertise to investigate and design LCM schemes. In many countries, central government has adopted some level of responsibility for the support of <b>regional</b> and <b>local</b> government; the roles of the various parties must be defined. A related topic deals with the question of which in-house expertise is appropriate for all road authorities and how and where to cooperate with other road authorities or with private consultants. Another key element in this approach would be how to finance the investigation, design and {{implementation of}} LCM schemes and related questions about the allocation of funding within the budget of road authorities. A final important item to be dealt with is the collection and dissemination of reliable information on the effects and costs of LCM schemes (in terms of accident reduction and in terms of understanding these effects). An evaluation system should form part of the LCM programmes, whilst the learning capacity of the design community will certainly be improved by cooperation at <b>local,</b> <b>regional,</b> national and international level...|$|R

With the set criteria, first upgrades to motorway level were allocated, and subsequently upgrades to <b>regional</b> and <b>local</b> <b>roads.</b> This was done until no more road segments could be upgraded because funds were depleted or because no more segments that meet the criteria were available in a region. This method assumes that network investment decisions follow an ad-hoc rationale of catering for transport demand where this is needed the most. We {{believe this is a}} fair assumption as long as strategic network investment plans are unknown for the regions that receive funding. We must acknowledge that the used transport demand figures are obtained from a rather coarse method that for example {{does not take into account}} spatially varying car ownership or the lessening effects that national borders have on transport flows [48]. We expect that this method is nonetheless useful here to demonstrate the effects that potential infrastructure investments may have on accessibility levels. Finally, the network improvements were assumed to be completed by 2030, with linearly improving traveltimes between 2006 and 2030 that fed into the LUISA accessibility computations.|$|R

40|$|In this paper, two parishes on Gotland {{have been}} the focus for intense study {{regarding}} the organisation and formation of local communications networks. The parishes of Buttle and Fröjel have been studied {{to see if it}} is possible to say anything about local communication during the 6 th century, a task that earlier research has shown to be difficult. The parishes represent two different types of landscapes, one costal and one inland. The paper has also asked questions about how the development and quality of the roads and communications networks have changed over time. It also discuss how the topographical- and cultural landscape has influenced the organisation of the communications network. The following questions are asked in this paper; 1. How was local communication (communications between the farmstead, its economic resources and its connections to the larger communications network) in the parishes organised? 2. What can be said about the communications networks development and quality through time? 3. How was the topographical- and cultural landscape organisation connected to the communications network?   The main methodology used in the paper is the retrogressive methodology used to recreate a possible 6 th century communications network. This methodology utilises and studies the relationship between the earliest known communications network, registered in the 18 th century maps, together with Iron Age sites registered, in the FMIS database, as well as topographical and geological maps to recreate a possible 6 th century communications network. The analysis shows {{that it is hard to}} grasp the local communications during the 6 th century. The local communications only emerge when the <b>local</b> <b>roads</b> merge with the regional ones. In many cases, the <b>local</b> <b>roads</b> were probably not much more than paths in the edges of the fields or only identified by the use of known landmarks. The investigation also shows that the <b>regional</b> (and <b>local)</b> <b>roads</b> were situated closer to the 6 th century settlements than previously thought. It is also shown that the development of the road network has steadily lead to a more refined and rationalised network. The largest changes can be related to the 19 th century laga skifte and to the later introduction of motor vehicles. Before the 19 th century the situation is quite stable, only some minor changes during the 18 th century can be seen until you reach the beginning of the middle ages. The major changes probably relate to changes in the landscape organisation in relation to the introduction of Christianity. However, it might also relate to the expansion of cultivated land and the resulting changes of settlement patterns. The investigation also shows that the topographical landscape on Gotland provides little hindrance for the organisation of the landscape. Instead, it feels very much like an artificial landscape where borders and organisation are created by humans, rather than by natural landscape formations. The borders in this case are created by the use of graves and their location in the landscape...|$|R
