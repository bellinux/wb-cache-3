40|$|The {{increase}} in the frictional resistance of a surface caused {{by the presence of}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> was determined by towing four planing surfaces of the same dimensions. One surface was smooth and represented a surface without <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> or one with perfectly flush countersunk rivets. The other three surfaces were each fitted with the same number of full-size <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> but of a different type arranged in the same pattern on each surface. The surfaces were towed at speeds representative of the high water speeds encountered by seaplanes during take-off and the range of Reynolds Number covered by the test was from 4 x 10 (exp 6) to 18 x 10 (exp 6). The <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated were oval countersunk, brazier, and round for rivets having shanks 5 / 32 inch in diameter. The oval countersunk heads were sunk below the surface by dimpling the plating around them. The results of the tests showed that, for the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> investigated, the {{increase in}} the friction coefficient of the surface is directly proportional to the height of the <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The order of merit in regard to low resistance is flush countersunk, oval countersunk (whether sunk below the surface or not), brazier, and round...|$|R

40|$|December 2006. "Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 62 - 64) This thesis {{presents a}} study of the effect of controllable riveting parameters, mainly squeeze force, rivet length, rivet diameter tolerance, hole countersunk depth and hole diameter tolerance, on the quality of formed rivet. The quality of a formed rivet is determined by the geometry of its head formation {{and the extent to which}} the hole is filled. The study determines maximum allowable tolerance on drilled hole in a 0. 064 ” thick aluminum sheet for a 1 / 8 ” rivet. The study is performed using finite element simulation of the riveting process. Theoretical relations between squeeze force and formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry derived in this study is used to validate the finite element model. Statistical design of experiment is employed to analyze the simulation data of riveting and determine the effect of individual factors, their interactions and relationship with the quality of formed <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> The results demonstrate that the correct formation of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> geometry depends upon all the factors studied. However, correct geometry of <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> is not enough to determine the quality of a riveted joint, because the countersunk <b>rivet</b> <b>head</b> does not expand enough to fill up the hole completely, thereby creating a gap and leading to a loose rivet. The gap increases with the increase in tolerances in drilled hole, limiting its allowable tolerances to 0. 006 ”. The length of rivet has no significant effect on the gap formation. To ensure the elimination of gap formation, an alternate procedure with reduced countersunk depth is studied, which allows for increased allowable tolerance in drilled hole. Results show that with as little as 0. 01 ” reduced countersunk depth, the allowable tolerances on drilled hole could be increased to 0. 03 ”, without compromising on the quality of the joint...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigation}} of machine-countersunk flush rivets for aircraft described in reference 1 revealed {{the necessity of}} having {{the height of the}} <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> greater than the depth of the countersunk holes if tightly riveted joints were to be obtained. If ordinary roundhead rivets were inserted from {{the opposite side of the}} joint and the countersunk heads formed in the driving of the rivets filled the countersunk holes completely, still tighter joints were obtained. In either case the rivets protruded above the skin surface after driving, and the protruding portion of the <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> had to be removed in order to obtain flush rivets.

40|$|Abstract. A {{frictional}} contact model is adopted {{for the analysis}} of conventional solid rivet setting. Material properties for the selected plates and rivets are obtained from analytical method using elastic constants and tensile strengths for each material. Rigid- and elasto-plastic models are selected for process analysis in this paper. Process variables are selected to investigate the effect of variables on the successful rivet setting and servicing in any structure as force transmitting member. Major variables in riveting process are material variables such as material properties and geometrical variables, which are dimensions of head, shank, and blank diameters. Analysis in this study is concentrated on the influence of variety of materials and of shank dimensions on the contact area after rivet setting, i. e. after forming process of <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> Soft and hard materials are selected as mother materials to investigate how the selection of material influences on the riveting process in quantitative manner.

Lead punching simulating 1 / 8 inch <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> were attached in full-span rows at a pitch of 1 inch at various chord positions. Tests were made at velocities varying from 40 to 120 miles per hour to investigate the scale effect. Rivets at the 5 percent chord position the upper surface of the airfoil produced the greatest increase in drag for a single row. Nine rows of rivets on both surfaces, simulating rivet spacing of multispan construction, increased the drag coefficients by a constant amount at velocities between 100 and 120 miles per hour. Accordingly, if rivets spaced the same as those on the test airfoil were used on a Clark Y wing of 300 square feet area and operated at 200 miles per hour, the drag would be increased over that for the smooth wing by 55 pounds and the power required would be increased by 29 horsepower...|$|R
40|$|Fatigue tests {{carried out}} on three {{configurations}} (unexpanded, cold expanded and riveted) of fiber metal laminate material clearly demonstrated the beneficial effect of riveting compared to cold expansion in zero load transfer joints, for an approximately equivalent level of interference. Digital image correlation {{was used to measure}} the in-plane surface strain on cold expanded and riveted coupons during fatigue loading, and for the first time, digital image correlation was combined with pressure sensitive films to measure the strains resulting from the application of the rivet, including those under the <b>rivet</b> <b>head.</b> A comparison of the resultant strain field showed that the application of a rivet significantly reduces the stress concentration at the central hole and is effective in extending fatigue life. Some <b>rivet</b> <b>heads</b> were removed by milling, and the results from subsequent fatigue tests were used together with closed-form calculations to explain the findings of this study.

Most of the tests were made with an airfoil of 5 -foot chord. The air speed was varied from 80 to 500 miles per hour and the lift coefficient from 0 to 0. 30.
