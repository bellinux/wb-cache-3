50|$|In {{the home}} shop the {{radial arm saw}} is an {{alternative}} to the table saw. Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The radial arm saw requires less clearance or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The <b>radial</b> <b>saw</b> is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs to be placed {{in the center of the}} shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a horizontal boring machine and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and disk sander. The major shortcoming of most current radial arm saws for home-use is that, most radial arm saws that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. A high-quality radial arm saw has carefully machined track arm ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the ability of}} an alignment jig/saw guide to reproduce appropriate osteotomy positions in the tibial plateau leveling osteotomy (TPLO) in the dog. Lateral radiographs of 65 clinical TPLO procedures using an alignment jig and freehand osteotomy performed by experienced TPLO surgeons using a 24 mm <b>radial</b> <b>saw</b> blade between Dec 2005 -Dec 2007 and Nov 2013 -Nov 2015 were reviewed. The freehand osteotomy position was compared to potential osteotomy positions using the alignment jig/saw guide. The proximal and distal jig pin holes on postoperative radiographs were used to align the jig to the bone; saw guide position was selected to most closely match the osteotomy performed. The guide-to-osteotomy fit was categorized by {{the distance between the}} actual osteotomy and proposed saw guide osteotomy at its greatest offset (≤ 1 mm = excellent; ≤ 2 mm = good; ≤ 3 mm = satisfactory; > 3 mm = poor). Sixty-four of 65 TPLO osteotomies could be matched satisfactorily by the saw guide. Proximal jig pin placement 3 - 4 mm from the joint surface and pin location in a craniocaudal plane on the proximal tibia were significantly associated with the guide-to-osteotomy fit (P = 0. 021 and P = 0. 047, respectively). The alignment jig/saw guide can be used to reproduce appropriate freehand osteotomy position for TPLO. Furthermore, an ideal osteotomy position centered on the tibial intercondylar tubercles also is possible. Accurate placement of the proximal jig pin is a crucial step for correct positioning of the saw guide in either instance...|$|E
25|$|A <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> has a {{circular}} saw {{mounted on a}} sliding horizontal arm. In addition to making length cuts a <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> may be configured with a dado blade to create cuts for dado, rabbet or half lap joints. Some <b>radial</b> arm <b>saws</b> allow the blade to be turned parallel to the back fence allowing a rip cut to be performed. In 1922, Raymond De Walt of Bridgeton, New Jersey invented the <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw.</b> A patent was applied for in 1923 and awarded to De Walt in 1925.|$|R

50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} miter saw began to replace the <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw,</b> but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since miter saws are unable to perform rip cuts. The <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the compound miter <b>saw,</b> the <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|R

50|$|Raymond Elmer DeWalt (October 9, 1885 - May 8, 1961) was an American {{inventor}} and entrepreneur, {{he invented}} the <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> in 1922.

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw,</b> table saws and hand saws were most {{commonly}} used for crosscutting lumber. Table saws can easily rip stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a table saw blade. In contrast, when a <b>radial</b> arm <b>saw</b> is used for crosscutting, the stock remains stationary on the saw's table, and the blade is pulled through it.|$|R
40|$|The name Value {{activation}} {{refers to}} the basic understanding of wood, where at present there are properties that are not fully exploited, but with help of a new sawing pattern could be fully utilized. The basic idea lies at an industrial level producing <b>radial</b> <b>sawn</b> timber with good profitability and with lesser and mostly a controllable moisture movement. In short it implies an activation of values of timber {{that has not been}} exploited in ordinary industrial production to date. This paper gives one example how the basic ideas in the concept of Value activation can be implemented in the industry. A new manufacturing system, the PrimWood Method, producing <b>radial</b> <b>sawn</b> timber, well adjusted to the conditions of the Swedish hardwood sawmill industry is presented. The manufacturing system generates knot and defect-free hardwood products with vertical annual rings. Utilizing the proposed manufacturing system in the Swedish hardwood sawmill industry imply an increased focus on hardwood in consumer products, which gain both forestry, sawmill industry and the wood manufacturing industry...|$|R
