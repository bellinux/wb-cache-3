40|$|The {{amino acids}} content <b>of</b> musts and <b>wines</b> <b>of</b> theree grape {{varieties}} e. g. Wälschriesling, Piont white and Traminer has been investigated. Great differenciss {{were found between}} the varieties in the content of total as well as individual amino acids in muts. Arginine was the predominant amino acid in musts of Wälschriesling and Traminer, and proline in the must of Pinot white. In larger quantities were found amino acids: glutamic acid, alanine, serine and threonine. In smaller amounts were present phenylalanine, valine, aspartic acid, leucine- hystidine and isoleucine, while tyrosine, methionine, lysine and glycine were found in very small qurantities. Wines were analized after the first <b>racking</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines.</b> Arginine, proline, alanine and gIutamic acid were acid were found in large amounts. In smaller quantities were found: serine, threonine, lysine and aspartic acid, and in a very small amounts were present phenylalanine, valine, leucine. hystidine,isoleucine, tyrosine, glycine and methionine. During conversion <b>of</b> must to <b>wine</b> by alcoholic fermentation,the quantity of total amino acids decreased. The decrease ranged from 10 per cent in Traminer to 40 respectiv by 50 per cent in Wälschriesling and Pinot White...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the use of}} the {{analytical}} method known as HPLC-FD and previously used the method for extraction of ochratoxin A by immunoaffinity columns, we have analyzed the possible effect of the clarification and filtration process on 54 samples of 2013 newly fermented wine, which have finished alcoholic fermentation process and racking, without knowing in advance whether there and how is the amount <b>of</b> OTA in <b>wine.</b> The <b>racking</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wine</b> before clarification and filtration followed by adequate clarification and filtration process during winemaking seems to be crucial in the reduction or complete elimination of the analyzed mycotoxin (OTA). The results of all analyzed samples have been below the limit allowed by the EU for ochratoxin A i. e. 2 ng/ml, and as such does not represent a risk to human health...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{properties}} that wrought iron has, wine racks {{that are made}} of this material are the most surprising and innovative in shape and design and as a result, they are often used more for decorative purposes than for storing wine. They come in various sizes {{and yet it is}} common that a <b>wine</b> <b>rack</b> made <b>of</b> wrought iron holds only one bottle <b>of</b> <b>wine.</b>|$|R

Since the physical and chemical indexes <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> grape are numerous, we firstly adopt principal component analysis to select the main physical and chemical indexes which can represent most of the property <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> grape. Then, we take the comprehensive score <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> quality as the quality index <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> grape. Later, taking the contribution rate in principal component analysis and quality <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> as the fuzzy evaluation weights, {{we set up a}} fuzzy comprehensive evaluation model for the grading <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> grape according to the international standard <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> grade. The grades of the red and white wine grape all belong to 3, 4 and 5 grade, respectively and the grading result can well prove that the quality <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> can reflect the quality <b>of</b> <b>wine</b> grape to some extent...|$|R
