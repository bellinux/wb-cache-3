5000|$|Rifamycins {{were first}} {{isolated}} in 1957 from a fermentation culture of Streptomyces mediterranei at the laboratory of Gruppo Lepetit SpA in Milan by two scientist named Piero Sensi and Maria Teresa Timbal, {{working with the}} Israeli scientist Pinhas Margalith. Initially, a family of closely related antibiotics was discovered referred to as Rifamycin A, B, C, D, E. The only component of this mixture sufficiently stable to isolate in a pure form was Rifamycin B, which unfortunately was poorly active. However, further studies showed that Rifamycin B was essentially inactive, but was spontaneously oxidized and hydrolyzed in aqueous solutions, to yield the highly active Rifamycin S. Simple reduction of Rifamycin S yielded the hydroquinone form called Rifamycin SV, which became {{the first member of}} this class to enter clinical use as an intravenous antibiotic. Further chemical modification of Rifamycin SV yielded an improved analog <b>Rifamide,</b> which was also introduced into clinical practice, but was similarly limited to intravenous use. After an extensive modification program Rifampin was eventually produced, that is orally available and has become a mainstay of Tuberculosis therapy ...|$|E
40|$|A {{randomised}} controlled {{trial has}} been performed in 150 patients undergoing biliary operations to determine whether an antibiotic which is excreted almost entirely in bile (<b>rifamide)</b> is to be preferred to one having satisfactory serum levels only (gentamicin). Patients were allocated {{to one of three}} groups: 50 received gentamicin, 50 received <b>rifamide,</b> and there were 50 controls who received no antibiotic cover. In the absence of duct obstruction, <b>rifamide</b> achieved extremely high bile levels but low serum concentrations. However, in jaundiced patients, both the bile and the serum concentrations of <b>rifamide</b> were too low to be of therapeutic value.

Despire poor bile levels, gentamicin was associated with a significant reduction of wound infection from 22 % to 6 % and septicaemia from 14 % to 2 % compared with controls.

40|$|EDITORIAL COMMENT Studies {{have been}} made of the biliary {{excretion}} of the antibiotic <b>rifamide</b> in patients with T-tube drainage of the bile ducts. Using a therapeutic dose, the concentration achieved is 100, 000 times the minimal inhibitory concentration for Gram-positive and about 100 times that for Gram-negative micro-organisms. Concentrations in the gall bladder were less but were of thera-peutic value, particularly with Gram-positive organisms. <b>Rifamide</b> is a new semisynthetic derivative of the famnily of rifamycins, a group of antibiotics isolated by Sensi, Margalith, and Timbal in 1959 from the fermentation broths of S. mediterranei n. sp., which also includes rifamycin SV, fairly widely used in clinical practice. <b>Rifamide</b> is the diethylamide of rifamycin B, one of the compounds which are found in the fermenta-tion broths, and has the following structural formula:-The chemical and physico-chemical properties of this compound have been described by Maggi, Galo, and Sensi (1965); it is an orange-yellow crystalline powder of which the sodium salt is soluble in water (1 P 5 g. / 10 ml.). Toxicological studies were carried out in labpra-tory animals by Dezulian, Serralunga, and Maffi (1966). The LD. 0 of <b>rifamide</b> administered sub-cutaneously {{has been shown to be}} of the order of 640 mg. /kg. in mice, 2, 500 mg. /kg. in rats an...|$|E
40|$|Determination of {{the minimum}} {{inhibitory}} concentrations of <b>rifamide</b> necessary to inhibit organisms isolated from the biliary tract showed that the organisms were almost invariably sensitive to concentrations which are readily attainable in the biliary tract. Three cases of severe acute inflammation of the biliary tract were treated and this led to rapid clinical improvement. In 61 patients undergoing biliary surgery a random group was given <b>rifamide</b> 150 mg twice daily, beginning 24 hours before operation and continuing for three days afterwards. In the untreated group eight patients had infected bile at operation and five subsequently developed a wound infection. In the <b>rifamide</b> group three had infected bile at operation and only one developed a wound infection. A similar number of postoperative chest infections occurred in each group of patients. There is some evidence of reduction in length of hospital stay in the treated patients...|$|E
40|$|Rifamycins {{are highly}} active against Chlamydia trachomatis, but the {{possible}} develop-ment of resistance {{has been of}} concern. The ability of rifampin, <b>rifamide,</b> and DL 473 to induce resistance in chlamydiae {{and the effect of}} combinations of antibiotics on chlamydiae were evaluated in tissue culture. When chlamydiae were exposed to step-wise increases in the concentration of rifampin or <b>rifamide,</b> resistance rapidly emerged. Stepwise resistance did not emerge after exposure to DL 473, although organisms resis-tant to one rifamycin were resistant to all three. Single-step emergence of resistance to rifampin or DL 473 was also demonstrated. However, these resistant organisms were difficult to maintain in tissue culture. Combinations of ampicillin, erythromycin, or a tetracycline with rifampin or DL 473 were neither synergistic nor antagonistic against chlamydiae. However, subinhibitory amounts of erythromycin or oxytetracycline pre-vented the emergence of resistance to rifampin. Such combinations may prove useful in therapy for chlamydial infections. Chlamydiae are extremely sensitive in vitro to the action of the rifamycins. One of these drugs...|$|E
