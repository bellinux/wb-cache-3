40|$|A central {{result in}} the {{economic}} theory <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> is that, if an injurer's liability equals the victim's loss, then either the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> strict <b>liability</b> or the <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> negligence can induce the injurer to behave properly.

This paper reevaluates the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> strict <b>liability</b> and negligence when the injurer's information is imperfect. Two questions are addressed: Under each rule, should the level <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> imposed on the injurer still equal the victim's loss?

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{behavior}} of experimental markets in which product quality is endogenously determined and cannot be observed by buyers prior to purchase. Several theories suggest that with asymmetric information about product quality between buyers and sellers and the absence of properly defined <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability,</b> markets cannot be expected to generate products of "optimal grade. " According to such theories markets will be informationally inefficient. Information that exists will not be properly used because the wrong people have it. As a result, products that can be cheaply produced but are of undesirable quality ("lemons") will drive good grade products from the market because buyers will be improperly informed at the time of purchase. However, very little noncontroversial evidence exists regarding the proposition. Several modes of behavior and institutions can theoretically intervene to mitigate the problems. In addition, theories are hard to test because measurements of preferences, cost, knowledge, and so forth, of sufficient precision to determine whether a market has "failed" are difficult in naturally occurring environments.

40|$|In toxic tort litigation, a {{plaintiff}} has no {{cause of action}} for increased risk of harm unless that risk is proven by a preponderance of the evidence {{to lead to a}} future physical injury. This rule of law is based on an antiquated concept of uncertainty, and evinces the law 2 ̆ 7 s detachment from the knowledge gained from other intellectual disciplines and the everyday workings of the world. This article argues that freedom from increased risk should be a legally cognizable interest, the violation of which gives rise to an independent cause of action. When analyzed under finance theory, increased risk harms a person by increasing costs, reducing economic asset value, and imposing a negative value option. The resulting damage for increased risk can be quantified more accurately by applying securities and derivatives pricing techniques used in the financial markets. Lastly, this article suggests that the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and damages proposed here create the singular circumstance in law where the application of a statute of limitations would be a suboptimal solution for defendants.

40|$|The basic <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in {{tort law}} is fault. The basic <b>rule</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> in {{contract}} law is no fault. This is {{perhaps one of}} the most striking divides within private law, the most important difference between the law of voluntary and nonvoluntary obligations. It is this fault line (speaking equivocally) that the present Symposium explores. Is it a real divide-two opposite branches <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> within private law-or is it merely a rhetorical myth? How can it be justified? As law-and-economics scholars, this fault/no-fault divide between contract and tort is all the more puzzling. In law and economics, legal rules are understood as incentives, evaluated within a framework in which parties take actions to prevent different types of loss. Tortfeasors can take measures to avoid accidents; contracting parties can take measures to avoid loss from breach. The context of the loss can diverge between contract and tortaccidents to strangers versus harm to a known breached-against party-but the underlying framework of incentives is similar, if not identical. Robert Cooter famously described this underlying framework as a unified 2 ̆ 2 model of precaution, 2 ̆ 2 and Richard Craswell showed how to think of the breach-or-perform decision as a problem of precaution, mirroring the framework of tort law. Thus, to those of us who take the idea of a unified model seriously, a significant puzzle looms large: if these two branches of law share the same underlying framework, why do they follow different liability regimes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractOn November 22, 2006, the European Commission {{presented}} its Green Paper: Modernising {{labour law}} {{to meet the}} challenges of the 21 st century. The Paper gives a different vision of the future of European labour law, one which helps increasing flexibility combined with employment security and reduces labour market segmentation. As an effect of this, a number of member states reconsidered their regulation and started legislation to reach a better level of flexibility. In Hungary the new Labour Code came into force in 2012, modified the rules of the employer's liability for damages, namely the causes for justification and created different grounds for the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> for damages in labour law. The Act also gave rise to a number of “new” legal institutions, mostly in the field of atypical types of employment that result in a considerably more flexible employment, thus providing employers with what is necessary for flexible employment. In the paper it is observed how the EU directives in the field of working conditions narrow the flexible employment through the example of Hungary. As a conclusion it can be stated, that the EU must broaden its legislative activities in order to protect the employees. In addition, extending unified labour law regulations to most legal institutes possible can be justified, as it creates a unified framework for employers and contributes to the promotion of equality within the European Union...|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} negligent infliction of emotional distress, {{one of the}} most controversial and least uniform fields of tort law. A review of the judicial and scholarly literature has shown that traditional tort analysis fails. In its stead, the common law has not found an alternative theory of liability that balances the competing interests. Rather, the approach has been to create rules of law based on probabilistic templates. Its dual purpose is to preclude individualized analysis and to limit aggregate liability. This article rejects the current doctrines as inherently arbitrary and proposes a complete overhaul of the law. To find a more principled solution, the notion of duty must be reconceptualized beyond arbitrary divisions and foreseeability of risk. Because of the unpredictable nature of mental injuries and its consequences on the application of the rules of law, the concepts of duty and foreseeability must be distinguished in finer gradations. The formulation of duty should be a dynamic calculus that considers the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s interests, the defendant 2 ̆ 7 s culpability, and the social policy considerations. When such analysis is engaged, it is entirely possible for a more principled theory to coexist with the practical policy of limiting liability. This approach requires that the <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and damage be adjusted to reflect the interests and culpabilities at issue...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to examine the}} general {{principles}} of European administrative law, recognized and interpreted by the European Court of Justice. An understanding of these fundamental elements of law is, therefore, vital to any study not only of the European Union law but also of the national legal system itself. Moreover the impact of these principles is pervasive: they are relevant in all branches and {{at all levels of the}} EU law. Because of the fundamental importance of the European principles for the development of administrative law, the first chapter of this study aims to identify the European principles that are more innovative for the national administrative activity. The second chapter analyzes the implications of article 1, paragraph 1, of the 7 August 1990, n. 241 Law, that was modified by the 11 February 2005, n. 15 Law with the intent of enriching the catalogue of the general principles of administrative action.

40|$|The {{argument}} of this thesis {{is that the}} legal liability of the administration in France and England, at first sight very different, is actually very similar. In France, {{the existence of a}} separate system of administrative courts with jurisdiction in delictual actions against the administration haG led to a division between public and private law. In practice, however, the distinction is less clear than might be supposed because the substantive rules of public and private law are very similar, while in some cases the State is answerable to the civil courts. Although French law is drafted in terms of general principle in contrast to the English common law, the existing <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> are not in practice dissimilar. Two theoretical bases of liability are, however, relatively novel: the risk principle (which applied to the administration can be used to impose liability for all unlawful or invalid administrative acts) and the principle of Equality before Public charges (which {{can be used as a}} theoretical basis for a system of administrative compensation). On examination, the adoption of these principles into English law is seen to necessitate a change in our traditional constitutional balance of power. Nor, in any event, are they actually the basis of the French system. Neither French nor English law is, at the end of the day, coherent and all—embracing. Both need to be buttressed by statutory and extra— statutory administrative compensation schemes. These should be seen as an acceptable and efficient substitute for civil liability and their development, co—ordination and rationalisation encouraged accordingly...|$|E
40|$|Harvard Professors David Rosenberg and Charles Fried have {{presented}} a provocative, sweeping {{critique of the}} theoretical foundations of tort liability that leaves virtually no aspect of our current tort system untouched, or perhaps more accurately, unscathed. Their article throws down the gauntlet to defenders of traditional tort law. For instance, Rosenberg and Fried take aim at the jury system, arguing that ex post liability rules created by juries are inefficient and should be replaced, whenever possible, by ex ante liability rules set by legislative bodies. And they attack the idea that compensation plays a legitimate role in structuring our tort system. In their view, {{in this era of}} near-universal access to insurance, deterrence is the only legitimate basis for creating <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability.</b> Despite my trepidation in picking up the gauntlet and doing battle with two eminent scholars, I take issue with much of their thesis, so much so that I began my oral remarks by saying 2 ̆ 2 so much to disagree with, so little time. 2 ̆ 2 But I was not asked to engage in a point-by-point debate over theory.

40|$|In European legal scholarship, many {{articles}} {{discuss the}} equilibrium {{reached in the}} case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) when the EU antitrust prohibitions apply to, and restrain, the free and ordinary use of intellectual property rights (“IPRs”). We call this the antitrust-IP intersection. The most interesting feature of this literature is perhaps the common assumption that a unifying substantive perspective, vision or theory on IPR underpins the intersection point reached by the antitrust case-law. Whilst the theory of “absolutism” can be quickly disposed of, several other theories like inherency, exceptionalism or complementarity {{have been described as}} the lynchpin of the antitrust-IP intersection. Our paper offers a different reading of the case-law. It submits that the antitrust-IP intersection does not rest on any unitary theory which, in turn, bespeaks the Court’s vision of the social function of IPRs. Instead, the main feature of the CJEU case-law is that a specific methodology is applied to antitrust cases with IPR ramifications. The CJEU deals with most of such cases under a rule-based approach, instead of a standard-based approach. By rule-based approach, we refer to the ex ante setting of structured tests of liability, by opposition to ex post case-by-case resolution on grounds of a pre-determined, general standard (e. g., reasonableness, competition on the merits, efficiency, fairness, equity, etc.). As will be seen below, this approach has many virtues, not least in terms of legal certainty. But it also has a major qualification. Whilst the Court has consistently formulated <b>rules</b> <b>of</b> <b>liability</b> and justifiability at the antitrust and IP intersection, it has at the same time often embedded abstract standards within those rules.
