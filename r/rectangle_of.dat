5|$|Soon after {{battalion}} headquarters was established, the battalion's first commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel William Cannon, began choosing his officers, {{who then}} set about {{the task of}} forming their own companies and platoons, as the unit structure was built up around four rifle companies– designated 'A' through to 'D'– with a battalion headquarters and a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons including signals, pioneer, anti-aircraft, transport, administration and mortars. The battalion's companies were formed largely along territorial lines, with 'A' Company being drawn mainly from the Mildura and north-eastern regions of Victoria, while 'B' Company was drawn from Geelong, the Western District, Prahran, Brighton and the Mornington Peninsula. 'C' Company consisted largely of men from Ballarat and Melbourne's inner suburbs, and men of Scottish ancestry, while those of Irish ancestry formed 'D' Company. Once the battalion's complement of men had arrived at Puckapunyal and formation was complete, basic training began in May 1940. On 18 August, the battalion was presented its regimental colours in a ceremony {{by members of the}} 14th Battalion, who had served during World War I. This was done in order to establish links with the units of the First Australian Imperial Force, and later, in early October, the 2/14th Battalion changed its Unit Colour Patch from a black over blue diamond to the yellow and blue <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> its earlier counterpart. Shortly after this, although still only partially trained, the battalion received orders to deploy overseas, and on 18 October the men embarked upon the Aquitania in Sydney, New South Wales, bound for the Middle East.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{earliest}} decimal measuring devices, developed in 1620 by the English clergyman and mathematician Edmund Gunter, introduced two new units of measure— the chain and the link—and a new measuring device: Gunter's chain. Gunter's chain was one chain (one tenth of a furlong) in length and consisted of 100links, making each link 0.001 furlongs. The decimal nature of these units and of the device {{made it easy to}} calculate the area of a <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> land in acres and decimal fractions of an acre.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that the scaling limit of self-avoiding walks (SAWs) at the critical temperature is (i) conformally invariant, and (ii) describable by Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with parameter κ = 8 / 3. We consider SAWs in a rectangle, which originate at its centre and end when they reach the boundary. We assume that the scaling limit of SAWs is describable by SLE_κ, with the value of κ to be determined. It has previously been shown by Guttmann and Kennedy GK 13 that, in the scaling limit, {{the ratio of the}} probability that a SAW hits the side <b>of</b> the <b>rectangle</b> to the probability that it hits the end <b>of</b> the <b>rectangle,</b> depends on κ. By considering <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> fixed aspect ratio 2, and also <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> aspect ratio 10, we calculate the probabilities exactly for larger and larger rectangles. By extrapolating this data to infinite rectangle size, we obtain the estimate κ = 2. 66664 ± 0. 00007 for <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> aspect ratio 2 and κ = 2. 66675 ± 0. 00015 for <b>rectangles</b> <b>of</b> aspect ratio 10. We also provide numerical evidence supporting the conjectured distribution of SAWs striking the boundary at various points in the case <b>of</b> <b>rectangles</b> with aspect ratio 2.

Each team has 11 players, one of whom is a goalkeeper. The offside rule is also employed. A goal cannot be scored from a stroke-in or goal throw, but unlike football, a goal cannot be scored directly from a stroke-off or corner stroke. All free strokes are “direct” and allow a goal to be scored without another player touching the ball.|$|E
25|$|The oldest type of {{footwear}} is peasant sandals (opinci) {{worn with}} hemp canvas, woollen or felt foot wraps (obiele) or woollen socks (călțuni).

Opinci were worn throughout Romania and over a wide area of south and east Europe being known as opanke (Serbia), tservuli (Bulgaria), opinci (Macedonia), etc. Opinci are made of a single <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> cow, ox or pig hide gathered round the foot in various ways.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Middle Ages, the royal residence was on the Île de la Cité.

The fortified castle was a great <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> 72 by 78 metres, with four towers, and surrounded by a moat. In the centre was a circular tower thirty meters high.

In a typical Bengali text, orthographic words, words as they are written, can be seen as being separated from each other by an even spacing. Graphemes within a word are also evenly spaced, but that spacing is much narrower than the spacing between words.|$|E
25|$|The bolt in {{the bolt}} lock is a <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> metal that is {{constrained}} to slide only back and forward.

Small knobs extend through {{the handle of the}} knife on both sides allowing the user to slide the bolt backwards freeing the knife to close. The Axis Lock used by knife maker Benchmade is functionally identical to the bolt lock except that it uses a cylinder rather than a rectangle to trap the blade. The Arc Lock by knife maker SOG is similar to the Axis Lock except the cylinder follows a curved path rather than a straight path.|$|E
25|$|These can {{contribute}} to control of blowflies and tsetse-flies for example. The blowfly traps contain a liquid that smells like the rotting flesh of a carcass {{and the structure of}} the trap is designed to prevent the flies from escaping once attracted in. Horse-flies can be controlled by traps that attract the flies to a suspended black ball that mimics a potential host; flies attracted become trapped in a cone above. For area wide control of tsetse-flies targets (these do not trap the flies) that combine a <b>rectangle</b> <b>of</b> dark blue or black cloth and often an attractant chemical act as simple mimics of the fly's host. When the flies land on the cloth they contact the synthetic pyrethroid that is impregnated into the cloth.|$|E
