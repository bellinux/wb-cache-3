40|$|Tooth {{extraction}} is {{a simple}} procedure that is frequently performed {{in the practice of}} dentistry. Bleeding is a common complications of tooth extraction. There are several materials or methods that may be used to control the bleeding. To minimize side effect, it might need natural ingredients as a <b>replacement.</b> <b>Tannin</b> and flavonoid is a compounds that can reduce bleeding time. Green tea and black tea are plants that have these compounds with different concentrations. Aims {{of this study is to}} determine the differences in the effectiveness of water steeping green tea leaves and black tea leaves as a hemostasis effect on wound cut-tail mice (Mus musculus). This is an experimental research with study design post-test only control group design. Samples were 30 male mice which divided into three groups. One negative control group (aquadest) and two treatment group (green tea and black tea). Mice that match the criteria is cutted the tail equal to 3 mm from the tip of the tail, then the ingredients is applied to the wound. Blood is dripped on absorbent paper until bleeding stop and data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis. There are significant differences between negative control group and the treatment group. In the treatment groups there were significant differences in the bleeding time between green tea group and black tea group. As a conclusion, water steeping from green tea leaves have a better effect than black leaves tea as hemostasis on wound cut-tail mice...|$|E
40|$|International audienceTannin-based foams were {{successfully}} prepared, using Norway spruce and maritime pine tannins. Various parameters, including {{the amount of}} procyanidins, were varied in order to observe the effect {{of changes in the}} density of the foam, on the structure its pores, and on the homogeneity, compressive strength, and compressive modulus of the foams. It was found that an optimum amount of spruce tannin exists, which results in a foam with the lowest density whereas the amount of cross-linker affects homogeneity, and the foam morphology is defined by the surfactant A partial <b>replacement</b> of pine <b>tannin</b> with spruce tannin decreased the foaming temperature and led to decreased compressive strength and a decreased compressive modulus of the foams. The main attribute affecting the reaction was the amount of polyphenols, or the amount of impurities (cellulosic sugars) present in the tannin extract...|$|R
40|$|Raw {{materials}} for adhesive production are conventionally from expensive petrochemicals, which affect synthetic resins relative to total costs of glued products. Phenol <b>replacement</b> with <b>tannins</b> (i. e., plant polyphenols) in Phenol-Formaldehyde resins is imperative since tannin adhesives are equally resistant to moisture and microbial degradation. Tannin was extracted from Tetrapleura tetraptera (i. e., bark, leaf and fruit) using distilled water and 1 % NaOH through Soxhlet extraction. Tannin presence, Extract yield and polyphenol/tannin content (i. e., Stiasny numbers) were respectively determined from {{qualitative and quantitative}} analyses. The solvent type and plant part influenced the yield and tannin content. All the three parts, especially the bark, contained tannin. Extract yield was greater in 1 % NaOH (39. 54 % [from leaf] to 77. 05 % [from fruit]) than in distilled water (12. 96 % [from fruit] to 18. 16 % [from leaf]). Conversely, Stiansy numbers for tannin, at all plant parts, were greater for the water-soluble extracts (i. e., 67. 50, 68. 96 and 87. 50 % from the leaf, fruit and bark respectively) than in 1 % NaOH (i. e., 33. 72, 21. 94 and 37. 42 % correspondingly). The large extract yields (i. e., 39. 54 - 77. 05 % for 1 % NaOH) and high Stiasny numbers particularly for the water-soluble extracts (e. g. 87. 50 % for the bark) demonstrate the potential of T. tetraptera extracts as agents fo...|$|R
