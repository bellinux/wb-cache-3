500|$|Prior to {{agreeing to}} create XIVs score, Uematsu had already planned to compose [...] "Kimi ga Iru Kara", {{the theme song}} for Final Fantasy XIII. Wanting him to fully focus on XIV, Square Enix asked XIIIs main {{composer}} Masashi Hamauzu to write the song instead. Thus, XIII was the first main-series Final Fantasy game soundtrack to not include Uematsu's work. Despite XIV being an MMO and thus a new genre for him, Uematsu treated it as any other video game project. Compared to his previous work within the series, Uematsu had considerable creative freedom while composing the soundtrack, because {{the rest of the}} production team did not fully envision beforehand how the soundtrack would sound or fit into the game. Uematsu created a mixture of orchestral and rock pieces for the game's battle themes. There was a momentary crisis when he lost most of the data for his completed tracks and needed to hire a data <b>recovery</b> <b>service.</b> He worked as a freelance composer during the project for Square Enix, also composing the music for The Last Story, a game from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi. The game's theme song, [...] "Answers", was sung by Susan Calloway. She was chosen by Uematsu, who had worked with her during the first Distant Worlds concert and was impressed by her singing abilities.|$|E

Service work is usually chairing a meeting but may be as simple as cleaning up after the meeting, putting away chairs, or answering a phone. Additionally, there are basic, formalized service positions at the group level to help the group perform its function: examples include treasurer, secretary and Group Service Representative (GSR) who represents the group in the larger service structure.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the types of <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> {{strategies}} and <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times on customer satisfaction. An analysis of the pilot test data and expert reviews provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the scales. Empirical descriptive statistics and regression analysis indicated the most influential effect of different service strategies and <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times on customer satisfaction. Three <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> strategies and two <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> times were examined in this study. Firm <b>service</b> <b>recovery,</b> customer <b>service</b> <b>recovery,</b> and joint <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> each took place within thirty minutes as customers’ expected <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> timeframe and within two hours as over customers’ expected <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> timeframe after a service failure. The results showed that all six <b>service</b> <b>recoveries</b> (3 by 2) have significant positive effects on customer satisfaction levels. However, the findings indicated that joint <b>service</b> <b>recovery</b> in thirty minutes had the greatest positive effect on hotel guests’ customer satisfaction levels. If the resolution is efficient, customer satisfaction increases. Implications, limitations, and recommendations for future study were also discussed. ...|$|R
