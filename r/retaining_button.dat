2500|$|With Alonso {{moving to}} McLaren for the [...] season, {{when they would}} be using Honda engines, the team had not {{announced}} in November 2014 whether they would be <b>retaining</b> <b>Button</b> or Magnussen as Alonso's teammate, leaving both 2014 drivers wondering whether they would be driving in Formula One in 2015. Button commented that his father would have been [...] "livid" [...] about his uncertain future. After the last race of the season, at which Hamilton won the Drivers' Championship {{for the second time}} and had been a teammate of Button's in the past, Hamilton said that [...] "McLaren would be smart" [...] to keep Button. [...] "Developing, building a team, stabilising a team, you need strong drivers to lead the team, and he's the full package." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{team was}} {{eventually}} saved by a management buy-out led by team principal Ross Brawn {{and chief executive}} Nick Fry, and would enter the 2009 season as Brawn GP. The team <b>retained</b> Jenson <b>Button</b> and Rubens Barrichello as drivers, and would use engines supplied by Mercedes. Honda would continue to provide financial support during the team's first year, and the Virgin Group who were linked to purchasing the team, would sponsor the cars throughout the season. Brawn won the overall title in what {{would prove to be}} its lone season before another identity change.|$|R
50|$|The College Inn Bar is a {{rectangular}} two story masonry building with 25 ft of street frontage, and 100 ft deep. The bar, {{made by the}} Brunswick-Balke Calendar Company of Chicago, features elaborate woodwork, with a mirrored marble and wood backbar. The mirrors were painted with western scenes in 1953. The barroom features taxidermy mounts and an arched vision screen with stained glass inserts, crowned by two stuffed golden eagles. Beyond the barroom is a lounge that used to feature ten curtained private booths, removed during Prohibition. The lounge <b>retains</b> call <b>buttons</b> and painted murals.|$|R
50|$|Battle Dress, Olive Drab, War Aid {{was made}} in the U.S.A. for the British Army and was widely seen in the Mediterranean theatre. Note the American use of 'Battle Dress' as two words. The blouse {{featured}} exposed buttons on the outer pockets, which also bore no box pleats. The fly front of Battledress, Serge was <b>retained.</b> Cuff <b>buttons</b> were exposed, and there were two inside pockets. A small, internal hanger loop was introduced to the collar. The collar was closed by double hook-and-eye arrangement. Tailoring was of good quality and the wool blend tended to be finer than British-made blouses. Type-specific plastic buttons were introduced.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the release}} of the Surface Pro 4, Microsoft {{introduced}} an updated version of the Surface Pen. While using the same technology to the Surface Pro 3 pen, it has only one (non-customizable) button on the side rather than two, and brings back the top-mounted eraser (<b>retaining</b> the <b>button</b> functionality) and also allows customizing the button (called the [...] "magic button") to perform different actions. The default options are: single-click opens OneNote, double-click takes a screenshot, press-and-hold launches Cortana. This version of the pen is bundled with the Surface Pro 4, the Surface Book and the Surface Studio, [...] it can also be purchased separately for the Surface Laptop. It is also compatible with the Surface Pro 3 and Surface 3.|$|R
5000|$|The larger end cap (the [...] "bottom" [...] of the bottle) has at its centre a small {{spring-loaded}} <b>button</b> <b>retained</b> {{by a thin}} wire, {{which serves}} as a [...] "fuse blown" [...] indicator. When the fuse blows, the wire breaks and the indicator button is ejected by the spring. A missing or displaced indicator thus pinpoints a blown fuse. The removable part of the fuse holder has a small window to allow inspection of the indicator without removal of the fuse. The indicator button usually has a coloured dot indicating the fuse rating (see table).|$|R
5000|$|And so forth. During the 1980s, {{stampings}} {{began to}} include the model number, a trend that continued under Camilluss ownership. The Coleman era (1984-1990) saw the use of some COLEMAN WESTERN stamps as well as ColemanWestern markings on the <b>retaining</b> strap <b>buttons</b> of knife sheaths.IDENTIFYING WESTERN STATES POCKETKNIVES Western States early knives follow the traditional numbering system of a pattern number, along with letters and other numbers that described the knife's features. Unfortunately, the numbering system was an internal protocol for employees and pattern numbers were not marked on the companys products until 1954. With Camillus now out-of-business, much of that inside company information has beenlost. Collectors today must identify early knives from catalogs and application of the numbering system. Most of the old stock numbers can be deciphered by using the numbering key explained below. Some older pocketknife numbers have a zero inserted justbefore the pattern number to signify a modification, usually in material or finish, such as (9393 or 93093) ...|$|R
5000|$|The U.S. Army Air Forces Class 13 Catalog {{listed the}} garment as [...] "Jacket, Flying, Type A-2," [...] with Spec. No. 94-3040. It {{describes}} the jacket's construction as [...] "seal brown horsehide leather, knitted wristlets and waistband (skirt)." [...] Broadly similar in construction to the A-1, it replaced the A-1's buttoned front and pocket flaps with a zipper and hidden snap fasteners (although some very early A-2's <b>retained</b> the pocket <b>buttons).</b> The A-1's stand-up knitted collar, which buttoned closed, was supplanted in the A-2 by a shirt-style leather collar, with hidden snaps at the points and a hook-and-eye latch at the throat. Stitched-down shoulder straps were also {{added to the}} design. Sizes were listed as ranging in even numbers from 32 through 54.|$|R
50|$|Initially upon {{conversion}} to artillery, the 56th A/T Rgt retained the King's Own cap badge in white metal, though in October 1939 this {{was replaced by}} the RA's grenade collar badge, worn as a cap badge. However, all ranks retained the King's Own buttons in service dress. While serving in Burma the regiment wore a white metal King's Own lion collar badge on a red/blue RA diamond patch on the turn-up of their bush hats. While serving with 1st Airborne Division, 223 Bty wore an embroidered shoulder title bearing the words 'ANTI-TANK BATTERY'. The 66th A/T Rgt also <b>retained</b> King's Own <b>buttons</b> on service dress. After the war the regiment wore a red lanyard in place of the white RA one, which it retained as R Bty of 306th HAA Rgt.|$|R
5000|$|Its {{design is}} an {{evolution}} of the DualShock 2 (DS2) controller, <b>retaining</b> its pressure-sensitive <b>buttons,</b> layout and basic shape. Unlike the DS2, however, it is a Bluetooth wireless controller (it will also function as a wired controller via USB) and features motion sensing technology. It also does not feature vibration motors (these were re-added in the DualShock 3). The L2 and R2 buttons were replaced with analog triggers and the precision of the analog sticks was increased from 8-bit to 10-bit. In place of the [...] "Analog" [...] button is a button labeled with the PlayStation logo, which allows access to the system menu. The underside of the case is also slightly enlarged to accommodate the internal battery. The Sixaxis is constructed of slightly translucent plastic, rather than the opaque plastic used on the DualShock 2 (and the later DualShock 3).|$|R
5000|$|In OS X Yosemite, {{many of the}} Aqua {{elements}} and icons were simplified and flattened, following a similar design change in iOS 7. Apple incorporated the same saturated frosted-glass effect, called [...] "Vibrancy", across the system. Examples include: the Dock, the menubar, sidebars, Notification Center and Mission Control. A similar effect was applied to toolbars, but they maintained their gray appearance. Toolbar buttons became white and Apple introduced a compacter type of toolbar that removed the window title, but <b>retained</b> the toolbar <b>buttons</b> (for example, Safari). Certain controls, such as checkboxes and radio buttons, gained animations, whereas animations in other places were removed, such as the [...] "poof" [...] animation when removing an icon from the Dock and the [...] "cube" [...] animation when fast-switching to another user account. Apple changed the system typeface into Helvetica Neue. Yosemite also added a 'dark theme' you can turn on in the settings which makes the dock and toolbar black ...|$|R
5000|$|Pistons {{are made}} of forged {{aluminum}}. They have three rings and aluminum <b>buttons</b> <b>retain</b> the 1.156 x 3.300 in steel wrist pin. The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high thrust load operation encounterd. The top ring is an L-shaped section [...] "Dykes" [...] ring that provides a good seal during combustion but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber during intake strokes as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an oil scraper ring whose function is to scrape {{the majority of the}} oil film off of the cylinder wall as the piston descends, to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This [...] "oil scraping" [...] also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts, the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after BDC.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of project 4480 {{was to build}} an environmental management system by using a visual or map based approach to develop new ways to manage environmental data on a large farm or an estate of several farms. Geographic information system (GIS) techniques are extremely powerful, {{but they tend to}} be complex, and often require a high degree of skill and training in order to use them. Using systems analysis, the fundamental environmental management data were identified and a simplified spatial approach was developed to manage these environmental data. Johnstown Castle Research Centre consists of three farms, ornamental grounds, forests, lakes and streams. A set of database tables was generated to hold farm environmental data on these farms. These included: annual management summary data giving the average number of different types of animals, the amount of organic manure and N, P and K nutrients produced by them, fertiliser purchases, organic and chemical nutrient usage on the farm, achievement of nutrient management planning targets, etc. monthly livestock information recording the numbers of livestock of different types for the three farms, together with management comments on the changes and transfer that take place over the month, detailed land use and nutrient use information for each field or plot on the estate, recent soil analyses information for the experimental plots, analysis results of recent water samples which are taken regularly at sampling points throughout the estate. The topographical, soil and site features were digitised, in order to collect information on the overall and individual farm boundaries. This included roads, hedges and ditches, streams, rivers and lakes, the buildings and most particularly, the boundaries of all field and experimental plots. When the digitisation was complete, a set of bespoke programs was built, using the GIS system, ArcView. To make the system "user friendly", the menu system was customised by removing complex features; <b>retaining</b> only those <b>buttons</b> and menu options that served a purpose useful to the application. The programs were unified into a PC system called Johnstown Castle Environmental Monitoring System or JCEMS. For the future, it is envisaged that the maps and spatial techniques will be embodied into an Access database system and developed for use by other research stations and farms.
