However, by the late 16th century, it had become genealogically <b>rigid,</b> <b>based</b> on the ideas of blood purity. The membership of the Rajput class was now largely inherited rather than acquired through military achievements. A major factor behind this development was the consolidation of the Mughal Empire, whose rulers had great interest in genealogy. As the various Rajput chiefs became Mughal feduatories, they no longer engaged in major conflicts with each other. This decreased the possibility of achieving prestige through military action, and made hereditary prestige more important.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a flexible beam clamped to a <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> {{at one end}} and free at the other end. We assume that the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> rotates with a constant angular velocity and that the motion of the flexible beam takes place on a plane. To suppress the beam vibrations, we propose dynamic control laws for boundary control force and torque, both applied to the free end of the beam. We show that, under some conditions, one of which is the strict positive realness of the actuator transfer functions which generate the boundary control force and torque, the beam vibrations asymptotically decay to zero if the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> angular frequency is sufficiently small. Moreover, if the transfer functions are proper but not strictly proper, we show that the decay is exponential. We also give a bound on the constant angular velocity above which the system becomes unstable. © 1994...|$|E
40|$|Flexible {{manipulator}} generally can {{be modeled}} as a coupling {{system with a}} flexible beam and a rigid moving base. This paper investigates the vibration responses and power flow of a flexible manipulator with a moving base (FMMB).

With the dynamic model, vibration responses of the FMMB for the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> having disturbance velocities and accelerations are specifically presented. Subsequently, to investigate {{the effect of the}} disturbances on the vibration energy distributions of the FMMB, power flow of the FMMB is exhibited. To verify the dynamic model, an ADAMS physical model of the FMMB is constructed. It reveals that the motion characteristics of the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> have a noticeable effect on the vibration responses and power flow of the FMMB and should be considered.

Multiple elastic subsystems are rigidly mounted on the rigid body; the elastic degrees of freedom are constrained relative to the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> body. A mathematical model is developed for this multibody attitude system that exposes the dynamic coupling between the rotational degrees of freedom of the base body and the deformation or shape degrees of freedom of the elastic subsystems. The models are used to assess passive dissipation assumptions that guarantee asymptotic stability of an equilibrium solution. These results are motivated and inspired by...|$|E
30|$|From this {{comfortable}} approach “the {{processes of}} innovation through ICTs {{that have been}} implemented in university institutions have {{tended to focus on}} the translation of materials and tools into digital formats.

In this regard, Steven Johnson (2010) believes that innovation can only occur in an environment that facilitates relationships between people and diverse materials that can be explored and recombined. The university system, like the school system, is usually <b>rigid,</b> <b>based</b> on the principles of repetition and vertical control, and against risk or error, concepts outlawed from academic vocabulary. The projects to incorporate technologies in education therefore prefer the product to the process, with the aim of efficiency based on the transmission of contents.|$|R

The <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> analysis neglects {{soil-structure interaction}} effects that occur during an earthquake loading and that affect the structure’s behavior.

40|$|Many future {{applications}} of robotic systems will require manipulators to operate from moving vehicles. Such vehicles will be compliant {{in comparison to}} the <b>rigid</b> <b>bases</b> on which most manipulators are mounted today. Base compliance can seriously degrade system performance. Statically base compliance may lead to error in the position of the end effector, and dynamically base compliance may interact with the motion of the manipulator and impair the stability of the system. The accuracy of the manipulator may be improved by modelling the base compliance and compensating for its deflection. Further improvement in accuracy may be achieved by endpoint feedback control of the position of the end effector relative to the task frame.

40|$|International audienceIn {{ship and}} {{aircraft}} turbine rotors, the rotating mass unbalance {{and the different}} movements of the rotor base are among the main causes of vibrations in bending. The goal {{of this paper is}} to investigate the dynamic behavior of an on-board rotor under <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> excitations. The modeling takes into consideration six types of base deterministic motions (rotations and translations) when the kinetic and strain energies in addition to the virtual work of the rotating flexible rotor components are computed. The finite element method is used in the rotor modeling by employing the Timoshenko beam theory. The proposed on-board rotor model takes into account the rotary inertia, the gyroscopic inertia, the shear deformation of shaft as well as the geometric asymmetry of shaft and/or rigid disk. The Lagrange's equations are applied to establish the differential equations of the rotor in bending with respect to the <b>rigid</b> <b>base</b> which represents a noninertial reference frame.
