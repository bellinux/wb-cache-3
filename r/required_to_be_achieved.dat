40|$|Abstract—Support for {{intelligent}} and autonomous re-source management is one key factor {{to the success}} of modern sensor network systems. The limited resources, such as exhaustible battery life, moderate processing ability and finite bandwidth, restrict the system’s ability to serve multiple users simultaneously. It always happens that only a subset of tasks is selected with the goal of maximizing total profit. Besides, because of uncertain factors like unreliable wireless medium or variable quality of sensor outputs, it is not practical to assume that both demands and profits of tasks are deterministic and known a priori, both of which may be stochastic following certain distributions. In this paper, we model this resource allocation challenge as a stochastic knapsack problem. We study a specific case in which both demands and profits follow normal distributions, which are then extended to Poisson and Binomial variables. A couple of tunable parameters are introduced to configure two probabilities: one limits the capacity overflow rate with which the combined demand is allowed to exceed the available supply, and the other sets the minimum chance at which expected profit is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved.</b> We define relative values for random variables in given conditions, and utilize them to search for the best resource allocation solutions. We propose heuristics with different optimality/efficiency tradeoffs, and find that our algorithms run relatively fast and provide results considerably close to the optimum. I...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} patterning fine line interconnections over non-planar surfaces and introduces {{the idea of using}} holographic masks for more challenging geometries. Design/methodology/approach – A photolithographic method for achieving grossly non-planar interconnects is described. The patterning of electrical interconnections onto the piezo-electric actuators of an ink-jet print head is used as an example. Uniform coverage of the substrate <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> using an electro-depositable photoresist. The required pattern is transferred via a custom-designed chrome-on-glass mask using a standard mask aligner. Findings – Large arrays of 100 ?µm-pitch electrical interconnections were successfully deposited onto 500 ?µm-high high piezo-electric actuators. It <b>was</b> necessary <b>to</b> modify the shapes of the line segments on the mask in order to compensate for diffractive line broadening. For more extreme 3 D geometries it becomes necessary to consider the use of holographic masks.

40|$|Abstract—Consider an {{arbitrarily}} connected {{broadcast network}} of N nodes that all wish to recover k desired packets. Each node {{begins with a}} subset of the desired packets and broadcasts messages to its neighbors. For the case where nodes must transmit an integer number of packets, this paper provides necessary and sufficient conditions which characterize the set of all transmission schemes that permit universal recovery (in which every node learns all k packets). By relaxing the integer transmission constraint, this paper gives a computable lowerbound on the amount of information <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> broadcast <b>to</b> <b>achieve</b> universal recovery. Furthermore, a network-coding-based scheme (computable in polynomial time) can always achieve this lower bound if packet splitting is permitted. In this way, packet splitting can provide a significant reduction in the amount of communication required for universal recovery. For cliques with N nodes, this paper shows that splitting the packet into N − 1 chunks allows the lower bound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> with high probability. I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effects of MeV ion {{irradiation}} on the adhesion and quality of diamond films on WC-Co tool-bits and silver films on soda glass. Diamond films of about 3 mu m thickness were prepared, using the hot filament CVD technique, on WC-Co tool-bits. Silver films of 1000 Angstrom thickness were prepared, using the Joule evaporation technique, on soda glass. 100 MeV I- 127 beam was irradiated on the films at various doses up to 1 x 10 (14) ions/cm(2). Adhesion strength was measured using a pin-pull test. Scotch tape test was also performed {{on some of the}} films; SEM images show no morphological modifications of the diamond films after irradiation. Laser Raman spectra show that the irradiation causes almost complete elimination of non-diamond carbon present in the films. Adhesion strength of the diamond films as determined by Pin-pull test show improvement at least by 65 kgf/cm(2) after irradiation. Improvement in the adhesion of silver films is found to be dependent on the amount of electronic energy loss (S-e) at the film-substrate interface. It is shown that for silver film on soda glass S-e > 0. 7 keV/Angstrom, is needed if the adhesion is <b>required</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> at a dose of 1 x 10 (13) ions/cm(2) using ion irradiation of 100 MeV I- 127 beam.

We prove an approximate inversion result and derive a characterization of the optimal initial measures by means of duality and the minimization of a suitable quadratic functional on the solutions of the adjoint system. We prove the sparsity of the optimal initial measures showing that they are supported in sets of null Lebesgue measure. As a consequence, approximate controllability can be achieved efficiently by means of controls that are activated in a finite number of pointwise locations. Moreover, we discuss the finite element numerical approximation of the control problem providing a convergence result of the corresponding optimal measures and states as the discretization parameters tend to zero.

40|$|A {{large number}} of studies have {{established}} that raised cholesterol levels increase the probability of the development of atherosclerotic vascular disease, and that reducing serum cholesterol will result in fewer cardiac events in the treated population, both in those with and without evidence of pre-existing coronary disease. More direct evidence that this <b>is</b> due <b>to</b> alteration of the progression of the atheromatous plaques has resulted from angiographic studies demonstrating the halting of progression or even regression of the stenotic lesions. Some workers have found a relationship between the extent of lowering of the serum lipoproteins and the likelihood of regression, although it has not been clear whether this continues to hold true at the lower extremes, nor whether there may be a threshold level which <b>requires</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> before regression may take place. The principal purpose of these studies <b>was</b> <b>to</b> investigate the effects of applying very intensive lipid-lowering therapy, including LDL-apheresis, in a group of patients with coronary artery disease and moderately severe hypercholesterolaemia to achieve subnormal lipoprotein levels, and comparing the effects of such treatment with those achieved in another group of subjects treated with drug therapy to the currently recommended therapeutic targets for such patients. The studies involved the measurement of lipids and lipoproteins before and after apheresis and at regular intervals throughout the two-year study period. ApoB metabolism was assessed at baseline and following completion of the treatment period, and the data analysed using a multicompartmental mathematical model. The patients were assessed non-invasively by exercise electrocardiography at regular intervals, and by thallium scintigraphy at baseline and at annual intervals. The principal end-point was the proportion of arterial segments undergoing regression or progression in each group assessed by computer-assisted analysis of coronary angiograms performed at baseline and on completion of the intervention. The results from these studies demonstrated radical differences in lipoprotein concentration and composition during treatment. There was increased catabolism of LDL precursors with diminished flux of apoB which may reflect up-regulation of the LDL-receptor, but a rapid return to pre-treatment lipid levels indicated the effects on lipoprotein metabolism were transient. There was a reduction in the progression of coronary disease in the majority of lesions, with a small number in each group undergoing definite regression. There were significant differences in the changes in exercise tolerance with treatment, and the likely mechanisms for this are discussed. The thallium scans demonstrated no difference between the groups in the number of segments with improved perfusion, but <b>were</b> shown <b>to</b> have some value in the non-invasive assessment of predicting angiographic changes in the proximal segments, particularly in the right coronary artery. The findings are put into the context of the recent publications on cholesterol reduction in coronary disease; implications for clinical management are drawn, and areas of potential future research are highlighted...|$|R
