2500|$|Gas leaks: [...] Air leaks can {{be caused}} by burst or leaky hoses, {{defective}} o-rings, blown o-rings, particularly in yoke connectors, loose connections, and several of the previously listed malfunctions. Low pressure inflation hoses may fail to connect properly, or the non-return valve may leak. A burst low pressure hose will usually lose gas faster than a burst high pressure hose, as HP hoses usually have a flow <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice</b> in the fitting that screws into the port, as the SPG does not need high flow, and a slower pressure increase in the gauge hose is less likely to overload the gauge, while the hose to a second stage must provide high peak flow rate to minimize work of breathing. A relatively common o-ring failure occurs when the yoke clamp seal extrudes due to insufficient clamp force or elastic deformation of the clamp by impact with the environment.|$|E
5000|$|There is no {{standard}} {{regarding the}} size of the <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice</b> for non-aviation use and that is what leads to differences in readings between leak-down testers generally available from different manufacturers. Most often quoted though is a restriction with a [...]040in. hole drilled in it. Some poorly designed units do not include a <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice</b> at all, relying on the internal restriction of the regulator, and give much less accurate results. In addition, large engines and small engines will be measured in the same way (compared to the same orifice) but a small leak in a large engine would be a large leak in a small engine. A locomotive engine which gives a leak-down of 10% on a leak-down tester is virtually perfectly sealed while the same tester giving a 10% reading on a model airplane engine indicates a catastrophic leak.|$|E
5000|$|With a non-turbulent [...]040" [...] orifice, {{and with}} a {{cylinder}} leakage effective orifice size of [...]040", leakage would be 50% at any pressure. At higher leakages the orifice can become turbulent, and this makes flow non-linear. Also, leakage paths in cylinders can be turbulent at fairly low flow rates. This makes leakage non-linear with test pressure. Further complicating things, nonstandard <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice</b> sizes will cause different indicated leakage percentages with the same cylinder leakage. Leak down testers are most accurate at low leakage levels, and the exact leakage reading is just a relative indication that can vary significantly between instruments.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} two experimental investigations for cavitation {{characteristics of}} <b>restriction</b> <b>orifices.</b> The first experiment {{is about the}} spatial distribution of cavitation shock pressure in a pipe at the downstream of <b>restriction</b> <b>orifices.</b> The second experiment is the investigation of butterfly valve throttling to the cavitation in a multiperforated orifice installed piping. From {{the results of the}} experiment for the cavitation shock pressure, it is concluded the maximum shock pressure remarkably increases with the decrease of cavitation number regardless of the orifice types. The maximum shock pressure becomes smallest on cone type orifice, and largest on single hole orifice. Multiperforated orifice is between this two. The results of the experiment for occurrence of cavitation due to the interference of butterfly valve show that the cavitation occurs at a relatively high cavitation number when the multiperforated orifice is placed at 1 D downstream of the butterfly valve. The butterfly valve throttling accelerates the cavitation at the multiperforated orifice because of the closed orifice installation...|$|R
40|$|The GTRAN {{program was}} {{developed}} to solve transient, as well as steady state, problems for gas piping systems. GTRAN capabilities allow {{for the analysis of}} a variety of system configurations and components. These include: multiple pipe junctions; valves that change position with time; fixed <b>restrictions</b> (<b>orifices,</b> manual valves, filters, etc.); relief valves; constant pressure sources; and heat transfer for insulated piping and piping subjected to free or forced convection. In addition, boundary conditions can be incorporated to simulate specific components. The governing equations of GTRAN are the one-dimensional transient gas dynamic equations. The three equations for pressure, velocity, and density are reduced to numerical equations using an implicit Crank-Nicholson finite difference technique. Input to GTRAN includes a description of the piping network, the initial conditions, and any events (e. g. valve closings) occuring during the period of analysis. Output includes pressure, velocity, and density versus time. GTRAN is written in FORTRAN 77 for batch execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer. GTRAN was developed in 1983...|$|R
30|$|In {{single-phase}} fluid flow, {{the theoretical}} analysis to evaluate pressure drop caused by abrupt contraction {{of the flow}} area is accomplished with one-dimensional analysis. We begin by considering the <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction</b> case: as a fluid stream passes through a sharp edge “thin” <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction,</b> the flow contracts to an area smaller {{than that of the}} orifice itself. This smaller area, A c, is called the vena contracta (Van Ness and Abbott 2008). As fluid converges toward the opening of an orifice, it builds up considerable inward radial momentum that causes the flow stream to continue to flow “inwards” for a distance downstream of the restriction (Darby 2001; Sahin and Ceyhan 1996). As the flow stream continues downstream of the vena contracta the flow expands in an irreversible process to the pipe cross-sectional area, A. Correspondingly, the pressure of the flow stream decreases across the restriction and continues to decrease to the point of the vena contracta, with some recovery of pressure occurring as the flow stream expands outward to the pipe cross-sectional area.|$|R
50|$|A leak-down tester is {{essentially}} a miniature flow meter similar in concept to an air flow bench. The measuring element is the <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice</b> and the leakage in the engine is compared to the flow of this orifice. There will be a pressure drop across the orifice and another across any points of leakage in the engine. Since the meter and engine are connected in series, the flow is the same across both. (For example: If the meter was unconnected {{so that all the}} air escapes then the reading would be 0, or 100% leakage. Conversely, if there is no leakage there will be no pressure drop across either the orifice or the leak, giving a reading of 100, or 0% leakage).|$|E

5000|$|The {{operating}} principle {{makes use of}} the high gain effect when a [...] "flapper" [...] plate is placed a small distance from a small pressurised nozzle emitting a fluid. The example shown is pneumatic. At sub-millimetre distances a small movement of the flapper plate results in a large change in flow. The nozzle is fed from a chamber which is in turn fed by a restriction, so changes of flow result in changes of chamber pressure. The nozzle diameter must be larger than the <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice</b> in order to work. The high gain of the open loop mechanism can be linearised using a pressure feedback bellows on the flapper to create a force balance system with a linear output. The [...] "live" [...] zero of 0.2 bar or 3 psi is set by the bias spring which ensures that the device is working in its linear region.|$|E
40|$|<b>Orifice</b> <b>restriction</b> is a {{traditional}} form of throttle used in aerostatic guide way. Practically, self-excited vibration or even air hammer phenomenon will appear in gas film interior when supply gas enlarges or the film thickness decreases to micron scale. In order to analyze the process from the pressure inlet {{to the entrance of}} completely developed laminar flow, Reynolds Equation coupled with the first order velocity slip is used. Since it has rarefied property, turbulence model and molecular dynamics theory are adopted based on molecular collision theory. This paper reveals the internal cyclone law in gas chamber and the relationship between essence of the shock formation and the gas molecule velocity excitation. Further study shows that, supply pressure, film parameters and chamber parameters have important influences on cyclone phenomenon and shock wave...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBased on the {{structure}} of a certain type of aviation axial-piston pump’s valve plate which adopts a pre-pressurization fluid path (consisting a damping hole, a buffer chamber, and an orifice) to reduce flow ripple, a single-piston model of the aviation axial-piston pump is presented. This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction</b> effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The effects of the pre-pressurization fluid path on the flow ripple and the instantaneous pressure in the piston chamber have been studied and optimized design recommendations for the aviation axial-piston pump have been given out...|$|R
40|$|This project {{addresses}} {{the need for}} new solutions to correct problems in existing EWB water systems, specifically, the need to control flow rates and water pressures at selected points within a water supply system. The proposed solution is to design and implement a variable flow pressure restrictor (VFPR) that can be installed into the existing water systems. Traditional pressure regulators are cost prohibitive for this application, so the main point of the research is to find a simpler, less expensive alternative that still maintains functionality and reliability. The study covers the selection of suitable hardware for the purpose, design of the new VFPR, method of testing, and results of testing the selected type of restrictor. Through testing it was determined that the simple <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction</b> hardware, with interchangeable orifice sizes, would be suitable for the application. A table of orifice sizes with pressure and flow characteristics related to each was created as a guide for student engineers to use while installing this hardware in the field...|$|R
40|$|If the {{pressure}} {{difference in a}} pipe, up- and downstream of a <b>restriction</b> <b>orifice,</b> is above a critical value, the flow becomes choked and an under-expanded jet occurs. For very large pressure differences, the gas experiences a significant temperature drop, downstream of the orifice. The cold gas causes {{the temperature in the}} pipe material to decrease and its material properties to change. In the oil and gas industry, this problem typically occurs during pressurization or depressurization of gas pipelines. The temperature distribution in a 2 ” pipeline, due to a flow restriction, has been investigated, using the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM. The fluid and the pipe were simulated separately using a quasi-transient approach. The natural gas was modelled as pure methane. The results show a minimum pipe temperature of 191, 8 K (- 81, 2 °C) compared to 177, 1 K (- 95, 9 °C) in Olga simulations performed by Aker Solutions. The upstream pipe is almost unaffected by the low temperatures, while approximately 0, 5 m of the downstream pipe experiences temperatures below the minimum design temperature (- 46 °C). After approximately 40 seconds, the temperature in the entire pipe is above the limit. In Aker’s report, this time is estimated to 228 seconds. A grid independence test was conducted and the temperature at the fluid surface was found to vary ± 1 %, when the number of cells was increased by 40 %. In the under-expanded jets, the locations and diameters of the normal shocks, known as Mach disks, are in agreement with experimental data, except for the cases with nozzle pressure ratios (NPR) above 80. The expressions that describe the Mach disk location and diameter are developed for free jets. In the cases with NPR above 80, the wall heavily influences the structure of the jets and thus the jets are no longer free. Based on the validation against experimental data, as well as validation of the solver’s accuracy, it is assumed that the obtained results give a satisfactory estimate of the actual temperature distribution in the pipe...|$|E
50|$|Bourdon tubes measure gauge pressure, {{relative}} to ambient atmospheric pressure, {{as opposed to}} absolute pressure; vacuum is sensed as a reverse motion. Some aneroid barometers use Bourdon tubes closed at both ends (but most use diaphragms or capsules, see below). When the measured pressure is rapidly pulsing, such as when the gauge is near a reciprocating pump, an <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction</b> in the connecting pipe is frequently used to avoid unnecessary wear on the gears and provide an average reading; when the whole gauge is subject to mechanical vibration, the entire case including the pointer and indicator card can be filled with an oil or glycerin. Tapping {{on the face of}} the gauge is not recommended as it will tend to falsify actual readings initially presented by the gauge. The Bourdon tube is separate from the face of the gauge and thus has no effect on the actual reading of pressure. Typical high-quality modern gauges provide an accuracy of ±2% of span, and a special high-precision gauge can be as accurate as 0.1% of full scale.|$|R
40|$|Ambulance {{suspensions}} often give a poor ride {{which may}} result in deterioration in the condition of ill or injured patients. To reduce patient vibration, purpose-built ambulances or ambulances with modified chassis can be used. A potentially lower cost and more effective alternative is to provide additional isolation for the stretcher only. This thesis describes the design and performance of a pneumatic stretcher suspension which uses a novel linkage to provide isolation in bounce and pitch. Results of linear and non-linear analyses are presented which characterise the behaviour of the suspension. The kinematics of the suspension linkage are shown to give to a vertical stiffness which reduces in compression. Pneumatic cylinders connected to auxiliary tanks are used as springs. These give the suspension essentially load-independent natural frequencies of around 0. 46 Hz in bounce and pitch. Damping is provided by fitting a flow restriction between the cylinders and tanks. By simulating {{the response of the}} stretcher to realistic random floor vibrations, it is concluded that a low level of damping is required and that an <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction</b> is preferable to a capillary restriction. These simulations are {{believed to be the first}} for which pneumatic damping is assessed by using a realistic random input. Additional simulation results demonstrate that improved isolation is possib 1 e by using an innovative semi-active pneumatic damper which is controlled according to the skyhook damping principle. A mechanical shaker which uses adjustable stroke round cams is described. Suspension tests carried out using this shaker are detailed. Various combinations of patient mass, pneumatic damping level, and shaker stroke and frequency are used. Acceleration transmissibilities are presented which indicate both that good levels of vertical isolation are obtained (eg. greater than 90 % isolation above 5. 2 Hz), and that isolation performance is largely independent of patient mass. Coulomb damping is shown to have a detrimental effect on isolation - particularly for low acceleration or high frequency inputs. The results of road tests are presented. These show that the suspension provides isolation above 1 Hz and reduces r. m. s. accelerations by 45 - 60 %. The suspension is concluded to offer the potential to reduce patient vibration at reasonable cost, although improvements to the design are required in moving to a production model...|$|R
40|$|Extrusion honing is a {{technique}} used for the finish machining of engineering components. The process {{may be used to}} deburr, radius or polish depending on the specific application. Extrusion honing utilises a polyborosiloxane polymer, which is mixed with fine abrasive particles and forced through or around components using an extrusion honing machine to achieve the machining action. It is evident that the machining process is very dependent upon the physical and mechanical characteristics of the polyborosiloxane. However, the process to date has largely been developed empirically, and further developments will require a greater understanding {{of the relationship between the}} characteristics of the polymer and the machining action. The rheology of the C- 11 polyborosiloxane has been investigated using a concentric cylinder, a slit-die and a capillary rheometer. The shear history of the polyborosiloxane prior to testing with the capillary rheometer was found to significantly affect the results produced. At shear strain rates up to 100 s- 1 and a temperature of 30 °C the rheology of the polyborosiloxane has been approximated to a power law equation (K. = 989 KPas; n= 0. 935). At shear strain rates greater than 100 s- 1 the pseudoplasticity of the polyborosiloxane increases significantly. Using this power law equation the velocity, shear strain rate and the shear stress within the polyborosiloxane in an extrusion die has been modelled mathematically. In some cases the extrusion barrel pressure and the mass flow rate through the extrusion die have both been shown to vary considerably during the constant ram velocity extrusion of polyborosiloxane in the capillary rheometer. It is tentatively proposed that such variations in the extrusion barrel pressure during capillary flow are a result of periodic slipping and sticking of the polyborosiloxane to the extrusion die wall. This mechanism is thought to be considerably influenced by the polyborosiloxane temperature, the extrusion ram velocity and the flow passage geometry. It is proposed that the measured variations in the mass flow rate of the polyborosiloxane through the extrusion dies are a result of pressure induced density variations within the extrusion barrel. This mechanism has been mathematically modelled. Temperature profiles within the C- 11 polyborosiloxane have been measured on an extrusion honing machine and the results suggest significant heat generation towards the periphery of the restriction. These results have been used to model mathematically the heat generation and transfer within the polyborosiloxane during operation of the extrusion honing machine. It is proposed that heat generation during extrusion honing is by friction at the medium/workpiece interface and internal shear within the medium. Both of these mechanisms would cause the greatest heat generation towards the periphery of an <b>orifice</b> <b>restriction...</b>|$|R
