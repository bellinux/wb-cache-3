Later that year, Star Films {{signed an agreement with}} the Gaumont Film Company to distribute all of its films. But in the autumn of 1910, Méliès made a deal with Charles Pathé that would eventually destroy his own film career.

Despite the extravagance of these féeries that had been extremely popular just a decade before, both films failed financially.|$|E
