5|$|Trans Polar made a {{demonstration}} trip to Stockholm on 13 June 1970—legal {{because it was}} without paying customers. The airline applied for permission to operate out of Sweden, but this was <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Swedish Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) and appeals were <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Ministry of Enterprise, Energy and Communications. The reason was that it lacked a permanent organization, did not have sufficient experience in large-scale charter operations and could not document that its charter operations {{would be based on}} their own resources. Despite the lack of permission, Trans Polar sub-chartered a round trip from Stockholm to London on 28 June. It then operated four flights from Stockholm to Rhodes, Palma de Mallorca and London between 4 and 6 July. Trans Polar claimed that they were flying courtesy trips and that the passengers had agreed to be compensated the part of the package trip which would have been paid to Trans Polar. The arguments were <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> CAA, who stated that this was a typical post-excuse and that in case of a courtesy trip the airline should not be collecting the fare in the first place. The incident was investigated by both Norwegian and Swedish police.|$|E

5|$|A revised design {{turned the}} {{mezzanine}} floor {{into an area}} {{that could be used}} as an arts venue, cinema, music auditorium or conference room for 120 to 150people.

This would have been half a metre less in height than the previous design, and did not include the tower. The plan was initially <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> council, but was subsequently approved in April 2008, before being <b>rejected</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Planning Inspectorate.
