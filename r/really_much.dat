500|$|Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier {{stated that}} the {{introduction}} of Wagg and Cutts represented [...] "yet another {{turning point in the}} series", praising the characterisation of Wagg as [...] "bitter and successful social satire". They were critical of Syldavia's inclusion as an antagonist in the story, stating that the Syldavian attempts to kidnap Calculus [...] "strains believability" [...] because they had appeared as allies of Calculus and Tintin in both the preceding two-volume story arc, Destination Moon (1953) and Explorers on the Moon (1954), and in the earlier King Ottokar's Sceptre (1939). Ultimately, they felt that [...] "the plot seems somewhat shoe-horned into the familiar universe" [...] and [...] "one feels that Hergé's heart was not <b>really</b> <b>much</b> into the action part of the story", ultimately awarding it three stars out of five.|$|E
500|$|Regarding {{his looks}} in the film, Ram Charan said, [...] "Personality wise there isn’t <b>really</b> <b>much</b> {{difference}} to Kalabhairava but I {{have to tell you}} minor changes like the shape of my mustache, a slight voice modulation, the background scale, the atmosphere and even the ‘Chandrabindu’ worked wonders on screen and gave a totally different look and feel and I felt like it was an altogether different side of me. When I was told of the characterization of ‘Kalabhairava’, I had an impression of a young, passionate soldier and naturally it had to have a great body and an authoritative voice. So, we also worked on it. We actually went to Rajasthan and observed the local culture and their way of dressing, we researched a lot about their costumes, history and great personalities 400 years ago and planned it accordingly." [...] Ram Charan sported a long hairdo for both of his characters in the film.|$|E
500|$|The Hot Lunch {{script was}} sent to Alan Parker {{after the release of}} his {{previous}} film Midnight Express (1978). He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was <b>really</b> <b>much</b> more interested in where the pain was in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite this, the duo {{have not}} staged a {{full-scale}} tour or performed shows since 2010. Garfunkel confirmed to Rolling Stone in 2014 {{that he believes}} they will tour in the future, although Simon had been too [...] "busy" [...] in recent years. [...] "I know that audiences {{all over the world}} like Simon and Garfunkel. I'm with them. But I don't think Paul Simon's with them," [...] he remarked. In a 2016 interview with NPR's David Greene, when asked about the possibility of reuniting, Simon stated; [...] "Well, I don't think most people do [...] The fact is, is, like, we did do two big reunions, and we're done. There's nothing <b>really</b> <b>much</b> to say. You know, the music essentially stopped in 1970. [...] And, you know, I mean, quite honestly, we don't get along. So it's not like it's fun. If it was fun, I'd say, OK, sometimes we'll go out and sing old songs in harmony. That's cool. But when it's not fun, you know, and you're {{going to be in a}} tense situation, well, then I have a lot of musical areas that I like to play in. So that'll never happen again. That's that." ...|$|E
500|$|Spears' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed by most critics. Linda Stasi of the New York Post asserted that Spears looked [...] "slim [...] trim and gorgeous" [...] and that [...] "her acting was {{nothing short of}} adorably believable". Stasi concluded that Spears' cameo was the highlight of [...] "Ten Sessions". David Hinckley of New York Daily News echoed similar sentiments, avouching that she [...] "proved [...] she can act every bit as well as she can sing". Michelle Zoromski of IGN argued however that while Spears' {{appearance was}} a [...] "nice change of pace from her latest public appearances", it was nonetheless a [...] "bit clunky and not as seamless as other guest roles have been on the show". Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club was also less enthusiastic about the singer's performance. Bowman opined: [...] "The Big Britney Episode, as it will henceforth be known, wasn't <b>really</b> <b>much</b> to get all huffy over. You can say this for the [...] team: They tend to minimize the annoyance factor of their special guest stars. Britney was a sideshow, and she got her couple of laughs, but she didn't hog the screen time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Douglas's {{view of a}} Jewish {{plot was}} nuanced. In 1920 he would, whilst {{recognizing}} [...] "the Jewish Peril", noted that [...] "Christian Charity forbids us to join in wholesale and indiscriminate abuse and vilification of an entire race". In 1921 he would state it was not acceptable to [...] "shift responsibility" [...] on to the Jews. In his Autobiography in 1929 he would write [...] "I feel {{now that it is}} ridiculous to make accusations against the Jews, attributing them qualities and methods which are <b>really</b> <b>much</b> more typically English than Jewish" [...] , and then indicate the country only had itself to blame if the Jews came in and trampled on it.|$|E

2500|$|Legacy admissions {{have had}} a history of controversy; {{economist}} Peter Sacks criticized the practice of legacy admissions as a [...] "social reproduction process" [...] in which [...] "elite institutions have an implicit bargain with their alumni ... 'You give us money, and we will move your kid {{to the front of the}} line.'" [...] Another agreed that legacies perpetuated a [...] "hereditary aristocracy". But an opposing view is that all colleges, to varying extents, make choices as part of the admissions process, including state schools that charge in-state residents (with taxpaying parents) a lower rate than out-of-state residents, and it was argued that there was not <b>really</b> <b>much</b> difference between taxpaying parents contributing to a state school as well as generous alumni contributing to a private school—both with the possibility that it will help their offspring get into college. Consultant Donald Dunbar suggested that admitting legacies encourages future donations, and in turn these incoming money flows help the school subsidize the education of more minority students; another source suggested that alumni gifts was important in helping a college pay for need-blind programs. Legacy admissions was criticized by Daniel Golden in his book The Price of Admission in which elite schools gave [...] "heavy preferences to the wealthy", according to essayist Neal Gabler in the Boston Globe.|$|E
