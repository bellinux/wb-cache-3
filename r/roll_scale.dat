40|$|The {{motivation}} for completing this specific project was because Ausgrid is currently conducting a small tiral of four Amorphous Steel Core (ASC) 200 kVA pole top transformers. this trail {{is part of}} a strategy to reduce operating costs of the distribution network, which would be specifically achieved by larger <b>scale</b> <b>roll</b> out of ASC transformers. With this in mind two apsects of this trial deserved further investigation: - A more meaningful economic comparison with specific attention to the performance of these transformers in comparison with existing cold rolled gain oriented (CRGO) legacy transformers across a range of load profiles. - an investigation into the possible increased levels of inrush current in these 'new' tranformers and what implications this increase level of inrush current might have on existing protection schemes used on Ausgrid's 11 kV distribution system. Both these investigations were carried out using Matlab applications and the results were as follows: - The ASC transformers out performed economically the legacy CRGO transformers across all load profiles. This performance was {{due to the fact that}} these transformers exhibited reduced no load and load losses characteristics. What further influenced these results in the ASC favour was that the purchase price of these ACS transformers is only 10 % higher than existing transformers. - The ASC transformers developed inrush current levels well below those designed for in existing protection schemes ad as such there is no implications if large <b>scale</b> <b>roll</b> out of these transformers was implemented. With these results in mind there was 3 significant recommendation made before larger <b>scale</b> <b>roll</b> out of these transformers: - Re-assess the manufactured quality of the transformers after a two year period. - Assess the performance characteristics of other capacity transformers. - Rectify an error within the inrush current simulator to ensure the validity of results presented in this report. ...|$|R

A bitumen based emulsion, Orimulsion, has proven to be an effective hydrophobic binder, which helps not only with the briquetting process but also in the expulsion of water from the coal.

40|$|Quasi-two-dimensional roll {{vortices}} {{are frequently}} observed in hurricane boundary layers. It {{is believed that}} this highly coherent structure, likely caused by the inflection-point instability, {{plays an important role}} in organizing turbulent transport. Large-eddy simulations are conducted to investigate the impact of wind shear characteristics, such as the shear strength and inflection-point level, on the roll structure in terms of its spectral characteristics and turbulence organization. A mean wind nudging approach is used in the simulations to maintain the specified mean wind shear without directly affecting turbulent motions. Enhancing the radial wind shear expands the <b>roll</b> horizontal <b>scale</b> and strengthens the roll's kinetic energy. Increasing the inflection-point level tends to produce a narrow and sharp peak in the power spectrum at the wavelength consistent with the roll spacing indicated by the instantaneous turbulent fields. The spectral tangential momentum flux, in particular, reaches a strong peak value at the roll wavelength. In contrast, the spectral radial momentum flux obtains its maximum at the wavelength that is usually shorter than the roll's, suggesting that the roll radial momentum transport is less efficient than the tangential because of the quasi-two-dimensionality of the roll structure. The most robust rolls are produced in a simulation with the highest inflection-point level and relatively strong radial wind shear. Based on the spectral analysis, the roll-scale contribution to the turbulent momentum flux can reach 40  % in the middle of the boundary layer...|$|R
