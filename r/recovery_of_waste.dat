40|$|The main {{research}} problem of this thesis {{is to find}} out the means <b>of</b> promoting the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> packaging <b>waste</b> generated in thefast food industry. The <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> packaging <b>waste</b> generated in the fast food industry is demanded by the packaging waste legislation and expected by the public. The means are revealed by the general factors influencing the <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> packaging <b>waste,</b> analysed by a multidisciplinary literature review and a case study focusing on the packaging waste managementof McDonald's Oy operating in Finland. The existing solid waste infrastructure does not promote the recovery ofpackaging waste generated in the fast food industry. The theoretical <b>recovery</b> rate <b>of</b> the packaging <b>waste</b> is high, 93 %, while the actual recovery rate is only 29 % consisting of secondary packaging manufactured from cardboard. The total <b>recovery</b> potential <b>of</b> packaging <b>waste</b> is 64 %, resulting in 1 230 tonnes ofrecoverable packaging waste. The achievable <b>recovery</b> potential <b>of</b> 33 %, equalling 647 tonnes <b>of</b> packaging <b>waste</b> could be recovered, but is not recovered mainly because <b>of</b> non-working <b>waste</b> management practises. The theoretical <b>recovery</b> potential <b>of</b> 31 %, equalling 583 tonnes <b>of</b> packaging <b>waste</b> can not be recovered by the existing solid <b>waste</b> infrastructure because <b>of</b> the obscure status <b>of</b> commecial <b>waste,</b> the improper operation ofproducer organisations, and the municipal autonomy. The sorting experiment indicated {{that it is possible to}} reach the achievable recovery potential inthe existing solid waste infrastructure. The achievement is promoted by waste producer -oriented waste management practises. The theoretical recovery potential can be reached by increasing the consistency <b>of</b> the solid <b>waste</b> infrastructure through governmental action...|$|R

40|$|This paper formulates a {{theoretical}} model which allows different waste management strategies in equilibrium, {{depending on the}} technology of waste recovery and the utility functional specification. In the model there are two waste treatment alternatives: ‘not-recovered waste’, composed of landfill and incineration without recovery and ‘recovered waste’, which is the aggregate of recycling, composting and incineration with recovery. We show that if recovery activities present constant or economies of scale then it is optimal to have zero not-recovered waste. The presence of diseconomies of scale in <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> can either result in an equilibrium with zero or positive not-recovered waste, but <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> is necessarily positive. We test {{for the presence of}} an EKC, and find that it is only compatible in our model when we assume decreasing marginal utility of consumption, and diseconomies of scale are limited. However, in the presence of (constant) economies of scale in recovery, we observe complete decoupling...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} this study was to identify and develop future opportunities and initiatives for the reduction and <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> generated by the food processing and foodservice sectors in the state. The food processing sector, as defined in the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system, represents a major portion of Georgia’s industrial base, and in 1995 employed 58, 700 workers, with total payrolls of $ 1. 42 billion, and consumed $ 9. 41 billion of raw materials to produce $ 16. 21 billion of manufactured goods, with $ 6. 80 billion of value added (U. S. Bureau of the Census, 1998). With respect to institutional food waste generators, restaurants employed 253, 800 statewide, 139, 700 of them in the Atlanta Metropolitan Service Area (Georgia Department of Labor, 2000). Other establishments considered potential generators <b>of</b> institutional food <b>waste</b> include retail food stores, educational institutions, healthcare establishments, correctional institutions, and hotels and lodgings. The potential for waste generation in the food processing and institutional food sectors, given their considerable size and broad scope, was thought to be substantial, hence the development of alternatives and opportunities for the reduction and <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> these <b>wastes</b> was expected to have major impacts, not only in preserving solid waste disposal (i. e. ...|$|R
