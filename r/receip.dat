METHODS—We used the linked Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results-Medicare claims dataset from 1992 – 2005 to identify women aged ≥ 80 newly diagnosed with lymph node negative, estrogen receptor positive tumors, ≤ 5 centimeters. To estimate life expectancy, we matched these women to women of similar age, region, and insurance, not {{diagnosed with breast}} cancer. We examined 5 -year mortality of matched controls by illness burden (measured with the Charlson Comorbidity Index [CCI]) using Kaplan-Meier statistics.

40|$|Dynamic discrete-choice {{models are}} an {{important}} tool in studies of state dependence in benefit receipt. A common assumption of such models is that benefit receipt sequences follow a conditional Markov process. This property has implications for how estimated period-to-period benefit transition probabilities should relate when receipt processes are aggregated over time. This paper assesses whether the conditional Markov property holds in welfare benefit receipt dynamics in Norway using high-quality monthly data from administrative records. We find that the standard conditional Markov model is seriously misspecified. Estimated state dependence is affected substantially by the chosen time unit of analysis, with the average treatment effect of past benefit receipt increasing {{with the level of}} aggregation. The model can be improved considerably by permitting richer types of benefit dynamics: We find strong evidence for both duration and occurrence dependence in benefit receipt. Allowing for heterogeneity in the entry and persistence processes, we find important disparities in the effects of observed and persistent unobserved characteristics. Based on our preferred model, the month-to-month persistence probability in benefit <b>receip...</b>|$|E

40|$|Summary. Using {{canonical}} regressio n analysis, {{the paper}} exam ines the associati ons between housing condition s, race, poverty and vin tage structure age in Cleveland, Ohio ’ s {{east and west}} sides. It is found that African-American s are concentrated in the oldest at-risk housing stocks on Clevelan d’s east side, but chronic poverty rather than quality de ® cien cy is most associat ed with their presence. On the west side, the oldest housing stock is experiencing the most deteriora tion, but a linkage between race and at-risk vin tage units is not estab lished; rather, chronic poverty is directly associate d with age depreciatio n. Lastly, in exam ining the effects of housing conditions, race and mortgage lending, {{it is found that}} credit access {{has little to do with}} race; rather, housing conditions and the age-depreciatio n process most affect cred it <b>receip</b> t and operate independently of race.

40|$|Paying bill {{is no more}} a {{nightmare}} {{for the people in}} recent days with the advent of technology. E-payment system has introduced multiple facilities of paying bills to the members. Now the members can pay their bills online by using the internet, if the facility available. They can also pay the same through net banking services. But according to a recent survey, only 6 % Indians use Internet and out of these internet users only 42 % people have the knowledge to make payment through electronic system. Hence it can be easily concluded that in our country majority of the members are out of this comfort zone to utilize these facilities due to different limitations. So {{there is a need for}} a system which can serve a member to pay multiple bills sitting in their houses instead of surfing the internet or walking a distance to a physical location. The proposed system is a multipurpose bill payment system that behaves as a payment cart. The responsibility will be taken by an organization (preferably sister concern of an existing bank or RBI registered NBFC) which is supposed to have tie-ups with the sectors where payment has to be done. The people can avail the facilities only by registering themselves with this serving organization and with <b>receip...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Recent {{trends in}} global {{vaccination}} coverage have shown increases with most countries reaching 90 % DTP 3 coverage in 2008, although pockets of undervaccination continue {{to persist in}} parts of sub-Saharan Africa particularly in the urban slums. The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine the vaccination status of children aged between 12 - 23 months living in two slums of Nairobi and to identify the risk factors associated with incomplete vaccination. Methods: The study was carried out as part of a longitudinal Maternal and Child Health study undertaken in Korogocho and Viwandani slums of Nairobi. These slums host the Nairobi Urban Health and Demographic Surveillance System (NUHDSS) run by the African Population and Health Research Centre (APHRC). All women from the NUHDSS area who gave birth since September 2006 were enrolled in the project and administered a questionnaire which asked about the vaccination history of their children. For the purpose of this study, we used data from 1848 children aged 12 - 23 months who were expected to have received all the WHO-recommended vaccinations. The vaccination details were collected during the first visit about four months after birth with followup visits repeated thereafter at four month intervals. Full vaccination was defined as receiving all the basic childhood vaccinations by the end of 24 months of life, whereas up-to-date (UTD) vaccination referred to <b>receip...</b>|$|E

40|$|Release {{measures}} are being published prior to final data editing and final weighting {{to provide access}} to the most recent information from NHIS. The estimates will be updated as each new quarter of NHIS data becomes available. Two additional periodical reports are published through the Early Release Program. Health Insurance Coverage: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey (1) is published quarterly and provides additional estimates of health insurance coverage. Wireless Substitution: Early Release of Estimates From the National Health Interview Survey (2) is published in June and December and provides selected estimates of telephone coverage. Other Early Release reports and tabulations on special topics are released as needed. In addition to these reports, preliminary microdata files containing selected NHIS variables are produced as part of the Early Release Program. For each data collection year (January through December), these variables are made available four files are made available approximately 5 to 6 months following the completion of data collection for the quarter. NHIS data users can analyze these files through the NCHS Research Data Center without having to wait for the final annual NHIS microdata files to be released in about June following the end of the data collection year. The 15 measures included in the present report are lack of health insurance coverage and type of coverage, having a usual place to go for medical care, obtaining needed medical care, receipt of influenza vaccination, <b>receip...</b>|$|E
40|$|Three {{models of}} {{sequential}} effects in psychophysical tasks are defined and experimental results described. These appear most {{consistent with a}} model in which the momentary value of the criterion is modified by memory traces, an independent trace being retained for each relevant past event. On this basis, a theory of criterion setting is developed: A long-term process determines an initial value for the criterion, and two short-term processes adjust the criterion (a) to match current changes in the expected probabilities of signals and (b) to maximize the information transmitted by the subject's responses. The theory is applied to results in the literature. Although signal detection theory (SDT; Green & Swets, 1966), which is now widely applied, includes the hypothesis of a decision criterion and puts forward normative prescriptions for its value, {{the problem of how}} a subject maintains his criterion at the appropriate value and adjusts that value to take account of relevant intercurrent events has largely been ignored. It is regrettable that criterion setting should generally be treated as a given but unexamined fact, because its proper understanding may clarify important psychological aspects of decision in all areas and may help to explain some still unresolved problems such as the causation of sequential effects. The object of the present article is to present a theory of criterion setting developed by the first author. As this theory arose from a consideration of some features of sequential dependencies, we begin with a brief discussion of the latter. It is a familiar but still unexplained observation that the outcomes of successive psychophysical decisions are related (Verplanck, This work was done while the authors were in <b>receip...</b>|$|E
