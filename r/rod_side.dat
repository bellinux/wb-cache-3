50|$|A {{differential}} cylinder {{acts like a}} normal cylinder when pulling. If the cylinder however has to push, the oil from the piston <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> of the cylinder is not returned to the reservoir, but goes to the bottom side of the cylinder. In such a way, the cylinder goes much faster, but the maximum force the cylinder can give is like a plunger cylinder. A {{differential cylinder}} can be manufactured like a normal cylinder, and only a special control is added.|$|E
50|$|The above {{differential}} cylinder is also called a regenerative cylinder control circuit. This term {{means that the}} cylinder is a single rod, double acting hydraulic cylinder. The control circuit includes a valve and piping which during {{the extension of the}} piston, conducts the oil from the <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> of the piston {{to the other side of}} the piston instead of to the pump’s reservoir. The oil which is conducted to the other side of the piston is referred to as the regenerative oil.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic {{cylinders}} {{get their}} power from pressurized hydraulic fluid, which is typically oil. The hydraulic cylinder {{consists of a}} cylinder barrel, in which a piston connected to a piston rod moves back and forth. The barrel is closed on one end by the cylinder bottom (also called the cap) and the other end by the cylinder head (also called the gland) where the piston rod {{comes out of the}} cylinder. The piston has sliding rings and seals. The piston divides the inside of the cylinder into two chambers, the bottom chamber (cap end) and the piston <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> chamber (rod end / head end).|$|E
5000|$|Usually, {{each pair}} of {{corresponding}} pistons from each bank of cylinders share one crankpin on the crankshaft, either by master/slave rods or by two ordinary connecting <b>rods</b> <b>side</b> by side. However, some V-twin engine designs have two-pin cranks, while other V configurations include split crank-pins for more even firing.|$|R
50|$|A {{coupling}} <b>rod</b> or <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> {{connects the}} driving wheels of a locomotive. Steam locomotives in particular usually have them, but some diesel and electric locomotives, especially older ones and shunters, also have them. The coupling rods transfer {{the power to}} all driving wheels.|$|R

5000|$|The {{steering}} rack is almost conventional. As {{with a normal}} power-assisted steering setup, there is a rack-and-pinion, and a stepped hydraulic ram with a dividing plate (the piston) in the middle. On {{one side of the}} plate, the piston area is half the area of the other, giving twice the area for the fluid to work on. Thus, with full system pressure on the small area side of the ram, and half system pressure on the large area side, the ram remains perfectly balanced and centred. This is because the lower pressure is working on a larger surface area. The smaller side of the piston is at constant hydraulic pressure, the other side only varies in pressure. NOTE: The author seems to be describing the DS power steering piston and rod, on which the piston {{is in the middle of}} the rod. The SM's steering cylinder has the piston on the end of the rod, which rod's cross-sectional area is half the area of the other side of the piston. Full hydraulic pressure is admitted to the <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> at all times while the pressure on the other side of the piston (its [...] "head") is regulated.|$|E
40|$|This {{engineering}} note {{documents the}} testing of the set pressure of the EC hydraulic drive cylinder relief valve. The purpose of the relief valve {{is to provide a}} safety measure in the event that oil becomes trapped in the <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> of the cylinder and pressure is applied to the cap side. The note includes an explanation of the procedure used and a summary of the result of the testing done on February 14, 1991 by Gary Trotter. The result was that the cylinder relief valve relieved at the correct set pressure of 10, 500 psig. The basic concern is {{for the protection of the}} cylinder. The pump is capable of providing up to 10, 500 psi of pressure to either side of the cylinder. The cylinder is rated for 10, 500 psi. Under normal operating conditions, the valves would be open, and the pumping pressure would automatically flow oil into one side, and remove oil from the other side. If, however, the valve for the other side was closed, so that oil could not be removed, then the pressure would build in that side. If the <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> is pressurized to the maximum pump pressure of 10, 500 psi, the cross sectional area ratio of 2. 29 results in a pressure of approximately 4600 psi in the cap side, which is well under the rated pressure. If, however, the cap side is pressurized to 10, 500 psi, the cross sectional area would produce a pressure of approximately 24, 000 psi in the <b>rod</b> <b>side,</b> which could damage the cylinder. Therefore, the pressure on the <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> must be limited to the rated pressure of 10, 500 psi. In reality, the maximum operating force on the piston would be under 11, 000 Ibs., which would result in the maximum cylinder pressure being under 8000 psi to the <b>rod</b> <b>side,</b> and under 3500 psi to the cap side. Therefore, the relief is only needed as a safety precaution in the case that oil becomes trapped...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} results of a Monte Carlo {{simulation}} study of isolated comb copolymer cylindrical brushes. The conformational characteristics of molecules consisting of a flexible backbone densely grafted with side chains strongly depend on the rigidity of the side chains, which is exemplified by using both fully flexible and totally rigid side chains. The short length scale fluctuations of the backbone are not affected by the presence of rigid <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> chains, whereas flexible side chains induce local stretching of the backbone. However, at the large length scale, the persistence length λ of the cylindrical brush is considerably larger for rigid <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> chains than for flexible side chains. Moreover, for rigid side chains the ratio between the persistence length λ and the diameter D of the brush increases approximately linearly {{as a function of the}} rod length L, thus supporting the possibility of lyotropic behavior. In contrast to this, in the case of flexible side chains, λ/D is approximately independent of the side chain length M. ...|$|E

40|$|Dynamics of a {{hydraulic}} system {{is influenced by}} several parameters, in this case mainly by proportional control valve, oil bulk modulus, oil viscosity, mass load etc. This paper will be focused on experimental measurement and mathematical simulation of dynamics of {{a hydraulic}} system with proportional control valve, linear hydraulic cylinder and mass load. The measurement is performed on experimental equipment that enables realization of dynamic processes of the hydraulic system. Linear hydraulic cylinder with mass load is equipped with position sensor of piston. The movement control of piston rod is ensured by the proportional control valve. The equipment enables to test an influence of parameter settings of regulator of the proportional control valve on position and pressure system responses. The piston position is recorded by magnetostrictive sensor that is located in drilled piston <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> of the linear hydraulic cylinder. Pressures are measured by piezoresistive sensors on the piston side and the piston <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> of the hydraulic cylinder.

40|$|Eleven infant boys {{presented}} with chin-up head posture, tonic downgaze and, on attempted upgaze, large-amplitude upward saccades with deceleration during the slow phase downward. The gaze-evoked upward saccades disappeared {{at the age}} of 2 or 3 years. In addition, they had high-frequency, small-amplitude horizontal pendular nystagmus that remained. Among these infant boys were 2 pairs of maternally related half-brothers, 2 cousins, and 2 siblings. Visual acuity ranged from 0. 1 to 0. 6, ERG-amplitudes (both A- and B-wave) were reduced, and severe myopia was found in 5 cases. Eight boys had CACNA 1 F mutations, and 1 boy had a NYX mutation, compatible with incomplete or complete congenital stationary nightblindness (iCSNB or cCSNB), respectively. This points to a defective synapse between the rod and the ON-bipolar cell causing the motility disorder: CACNA 1 F is located on the <b>rod</b> <b>side</b> of this synapse, whereas NYX is located {{on the side of the}} ON-bipolar cell. The coexistence of horizontal and vertical nystagmus has been previously described in dark-reared cat...|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> that spans multiple axles with a scotch yoke used at each intermediate axle. This approach was quite common when <b>side</b> <b>rods</b> were used to link a jackshaft to 2 or more driving wheels on electric locomotives and some early internal combustion locomotives. The Swiss Ce 6/8II Crocodile locomotive is a prominent example, but there were others.|$|R
50|$|All {{the driving}} wheels have an {{out-of-balance}} {{which is caused}} by their off-center crank pins and attached components. The main driving wheels have the greatest unbalance since they have the biggest crankpin {{as well as the}} revolving portion of the main rod. They also have the valve gear eccentric crank and the back end of the eccentric rod. In common with the linked driving wheels they also have their own portion of the <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> weight. The part of the main rod assigned a revolving motion was originally measured by weighing it supported at each end. A more accurate method became necessary which split the revolving and reciprocating parts based on the position of the center of percussion. This position was measured by swinging the rod as a pendulum. The unbalance in the remaining driving wheels is caused by a crankpin and <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> weight. The <b>side</b> <b>rod</b> weights assigned to each crankpin are measured by suspending the rod on as many scales as there are crankpins or by calculation.|$|R

40|$|The Non-Equilibrium Plasma Pinch (NEPP), {{also known}} as the Dense Plasma Focus (DPF) is well known as a source of {{energetic}} ions, relativistic electrons and neutrons as well as electromagnetic radiation extending from the infrared to X-ray. In this dissertation, the operation of a 15 kJ, Mather type, NEPP machine is studied in detail. A large number of experiments are carried out to tune the machine parameters for best performance using helium and hydrogen as filling gases. The NEPP machine is modified to be able to extract the copious number of electrons generated at the pinch. A hollow anode with small hole at the flat end, and a mock magnetron without biasing magnetic field are built. The electrons generated at the pinch are very difficult to capture, therefore a novel device is built to capture and transport the electrons from the pinch to the magnetron. The novel cup-rod-needle device successfully serves the purpose to capture and transport electrons to monitor the pinch current. Further, the device has the potential to field emit charges from its needle end acting as a pulsed electron source for other devices such as the magnetron. Diagnostics tools are designed, modeled, built, calibrated, and implemented in the machine to measure the pinch dynamics. A novel, UNLV patented electromagnetic dot sensors are successfully calibrated, and implemented in the machine. A new calibration technique is developed and test stands designed and built to measure the dot 2 ̆ 7 s ability to track the impetus signal over its dynamic range starting and ending in the noise region. The patented EM-dot sensor shows superior performance over traditional electromagnetic sensors, such as Rogowski coils. On the other hand, the cup-rod structure, when grounded on the <b>rod</b> <b>side,</b> serves as a diagnostic tool to monitor the pinch current by sampling the actual current, a quantity that has been always very challenging to measure without perturbing the pinch. To the best of our knowledge, this method of measuring the pinch current is unique and has never been done before. Agreement with other models is shown. The operation of the NEPP machine with the hole {{in the center of the}} anode and the magnetron connected including the cup-rod structure is examined against the NEPP machine signature with solid anode. Both cases showed excellent agreement. This suggests that the existence of the hole and the diagnostic tool inside the anode have negligible effects on the pinch...|$|E

5000|$|Some early {{locomotives}} used small diameter DC {{traction motors}} mounted on individual axles, but the majority, especially for AC powered locomotives, {{had only one}} or two large diameter motors.
