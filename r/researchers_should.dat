25|$|Several obituaries {{describe}} Liberati's professional experience, {{highlighting the}} main features of his work and the ideas he supported. He believed that within a health system, research should {{be an integral part}} of its mission, especially where lack of commercial interests prevents the possibility of private investment, and that <b>researchers</b> <b>should</b> concentrate on what is relevant to patients, not to their careers or to drug companies. Moreover, he strongly believed that developing alliances with consumers is necessary for setting research priorities, and that research results should be easily accessible to people who need to make decisions about their own health.|$|E

500|$|The philosopher Paul Thagard {{asserts that}} astrology cannot be {{regarded}} as falsified in this sense until it has been replaced with a successor. In the case of predicting behaviour, psychology is the alternative. To Thagard a further criterion of demarcation of science from pseudoscience is that the state-of-the-art must progress and that the community of <b>researchers</b> <b>should</b> be attempting to compare the current theory to alternatives, and not be [...] "selective in considering confirmations and disconfirmations." [...] Progress is defined here as explaining new phenomena and solving existing problems, yet astrology has failed to progress having only changed little in nearly 2000 years. To Thagard, astrologers are acting as though engaged in normal science believing that the foundations of astrology were well established despite the [...] "many unsolved problems," [...] and {{in the face of}} better alternative theories (psychology). For these reasons Thagard views astrology as pseudoscience.|$|E

2500|$|Rusty Barrett {{suggests}} {{that the idea of}} the homogeneous speech community could perhaps be more accurately replaced by one of a queer community based on community spirit or a queer cultural system, since language use varies so greatly. Kulick proposes, instead of studying speech communities that he concludes [...] "do not and cannot exist" [...] because of methodological problems, <b>researchers</b> <b>should</b> study [...] "language and desire" [...] through examining repression in the context of linguistics, considering both what is said and what is not or cannot be said. Kulick addresses the need for consideration of the role of sexuality in sexual identity, unlike some lavender linguists who neglect sexuality in favor of linguistic features that might be more likely than sexuality to legitimize gay identity.|$|E

2500|$|After being {{defeated}} repeatedly by Western {{nations in}} the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology {{as part of the}} Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communist victory in 1949 science and technology research was organized based on the model of the Soviet Union. It was characterized by a bureaucratic organization led by non-scientists, research according to the goals of central plans, separation of research from production, specialized research institutes, concentration on practical applications, and restrictions on information flows. <b>Researchers</b> <b>should</b> work as collectives for society rather than as individuals seeking recognition. Many studied in the Soviet Union which also transferred technology. The Cultural revolution, which sought to remove perceived [...] "bourgeois" [...] influences and attitudes, caused large negative effects and disruptions. Among other measures it saw the scientific community and formal education attacked, intellectuals were sent to do manual labor, universities and academic journals were closed, most research ceased, and for nearly a decade China trained no new scientists and engineers.|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, Northwestern University {{professor}} of clinical medical humanities and bioethics Alice Dreger commented on Bailey's {{response to the}} negative reactions: [...] "Bailey may claim he was not insensitive, but {{given the number of}} people he offended with his prose, he is obviously, objectively wrong—being perceived as insensitive by this many people surely means you have been insensitive. (Especially if you don’t get that.)" [...] Physician Charles Allen Moser, though, believes that Bailey caused his own controversy by being mean spirited. [...] "To call a transsexual who denies Autogynephilia vigorously autogynephilic or an autogynephile-in-denial is also inflammatory and inappropriate. One can convey the same point with more cautious language. In general, <b>researchers</b> <b>should</b> avoid inciting hostility from their subjects. Stating that a subject is in denial or misleading the researcher usually leads to an angry reaction. Ridiculing someone for their beliefs, religious, political, or gender identification is never a good strategy. Ignoring these common courtesies will probably lead to an ugly confrontation, such as this “controversy.” Being a researcher does not confer immunity from the consequences of incivility." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{design that}} is {{selected}} for any study {{is like a}} skeleton which supports the {{different parts of the}} research. It is the research design which determines how the data should be collected, analyzed and interpreted. This article attempts to delineate the different research approaches: qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods design. At this juncture, the crucial issue is the gathering of information in order to get an understanding of the problem more deeply and find appropriate ways of dealing with it. Therefore, the data collection discusses the different types of data that should be obtained. After collecting the necessary data, the <b>researcher</b> <b>should</b> analyze them in detail. Thus, the data analysis is dealt at length. It is crucial that before carrying out the real study, the researcher ensure that the research design, data collection instruments and data analysis work well. Therefore, the pilot study comes to the aid of the researcher to help approach the actual phase of the research more confidently. Finally, every <b>researcher</b> <b>should</b> consider the rights of the participants and take heed of some rules during and after the research process.

40|$|This {{article is}} a {{continuation}} of the previous module on designing questionnaires and clinical record form in which we have discussed some basic points about designing the questionnaire and clinical record forms. In this section, we will discuss {{the reliability and validity of}} questionnaires. The different types of validity are face validity, content validity, criterion validity, and construct validity. The different types of reliability are test-retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and intra-rater reliability. Some of these parameters are assessed by subject area experts. However, statistical tests should be used for evaluation of other parameters. Once the questionnaire has been designed, the <b>researcher</b> <b>should</b> pilot test the questionnaire. The items in the questionnaire should be changed based on the feedback from the pilot study participants and the researcher's experience. After the basic structure of the questionnaire has been finalized, the <b>researcher</b> <b>should</b> assess the validity and reliability of the questionnaire or the scale. If an existing standard questionnaire is translated in the local language, the <b>researcher</b> <b>should</b> assess the reliability and validity of the translated questionnaire, and these values should be presented in the manuscript.
