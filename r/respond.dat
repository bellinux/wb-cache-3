40|$|Rates and {{patterns}} of key-press <b>responding</b> maintained under schedules in which <b>responding</b> resulted in intravenous injections of cocaine were studied in squirrel monkeys and rhesus monkeys.

Under FR 10 or FR 30 schedules, performance was characterized by high rates of <b>responding</b> (usually more than one response per second) in each ratio.

40|$|Local {{patterns}} of <b>responding</b> were studied when pigeons pecked for food in concurrent variable-interval schedules (Experiment I) and in multiple variable-interval schedules (Experiment II). In Experiment I, {{similarities in the}} distribution of interresponse times on the two keys provided further evidence that <b>responding</b> on concurrent schedules is determined more by allocation of time than by changes in local pattern of <b>responding.</b> Relative <b>responding</b> in local intervals since a preceding reinforcement showed consistent deviations from matching between relative <b>responding</b> and relative reinforcement in various postreinforcement intervals. Response rates in local intervals since a preceding changeover showed that rate of <b>responding</b> is not the same on both keys in all postchangeover intervals. The relative amount of time consumed by interchangeover times of a given duration approximately matched relative frequency of reinforced interchangeover times of that duration. However, computer simulation showed that this matching was probably a necessary artifact of concurrent schedules. In Experiment II, when component durations were 180 sec, the relationship between distribution of interresponse times and rate of reinforcement in the component showed that <b>responding</b> was determined by local pattern of <b>responding</b> in the components. Since <b>responding</b> on concurrent schedules appears to be determined by time allocation, this result would establish a behavioral difference between multiple and concurrent schedules. However, when component durations were 5 sec, local pattern of <b>responding</b> in a component (defined by interresponse times) was less important in determining <b>responding</b> than was amount of time spent <b>responding</b> in a component (defined by latencies). In fact, with 5 -sec component durations, the relative amount of time spent <b>responding</b> in a component approximately matched relative frequency of reinforcement in the component. Thus, as component durations in multiple schedules decrease, multiple schedules become more like concurrent schedules, in the sense that <b>responding</b> is affected by allocation of time rather than by local pattern of <b>responding...</b>|$|R
