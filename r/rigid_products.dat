The objective is to find the optimal design proposal of a thing walled aerospace component, for which a predecessor design subsists. ANSYS is used to develop the FE model of initial design space of component. TOSCA is used for topology optimization, data reduction and smoothing of optimization results for CAD compatible output. The optimized model is then imported in CATIA to incorporate necessary refinements for manufacturing, machining and geometric restrictions. To validate this new design proposal, optimized model is then imported in ANSYS and analyzed again under the stipulated loads and boundary conditions.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this thesis, three innovative electrochemical devices have been studied. A {{part of the work}} is devoted to an already existing device, laminates which are debonded by the application of a voltage. This type of material can potentially be used {{in a wide range of}} applications, including adhesive joints in vehicles to both reduce the total weight and to simplify the disassembly after end-of-life, enabling an inexpensive recycling process. Although already a functioning device, the development and tailoring of this process was slowed by a lack of knowledge concerning the actual electrochemical processes responsible for the debonding. The laminate studied consisted of an epoxy adhesive, mixed with an ionic liquid, bonding two aluminium foils. The results showed that the electrochemical reaction taking place at the releasing anode interface caused a very large increase in potential during galvanostatic polarization. Scanning electron microscopy images showed reaction products growing out from the electrode surface into the adhesive. These reaction products were believed to cause the debonding through swelling of the anodic interface so rupturing the adhesive bond. The other part of the work in this thesis was aimed at innovative lithium ion (Li‑ion) battery concepts. Commercial Li-ion batteries are two-dimensional thin film constructions utilized in most often mechanically <b>rigid</b> <b>products.</b> Two routes were followed in this thesis. In the first, the aim was flexible batteries that could be used in applications such as bendable reading devices. For this purpose, nano-fibrillated cellulose was used as binder material to make flexible battery components. This was achieved through a water-based filtration process, creating flexible and strong papers. These paper-based battery components showed good mechanical properties as well as good rate capabilities during cycling. The drawback using this method was relatively low coulombic efficiencies believed to originate from side-reactions caused by water remnants in the cellulose structure. The second Li-ion battery route comprised an electrochemical process to coat carbon fibers, shown to perform well as negative electrode in Li-ion batteries, from a monomer solution. The resulting polymer coatings were ~ 500  nm thick and contained lithium ions. This process could be controlled by mainly salt content in the monomer solution and polarization time, yielding thin and apparently pin-hole free coatings. By utilizing the carbon fiber/polymer composite as integrated electrode and electrolyte, a variety of battery designs could possibly be created, such as three-dimensional batteries and structural batteries.

40|$|Economic {{reform is}} {{sometimes}} seen as damaging to a government's re-election chances, but anecdotal evidence from OECD countries would {{not seem to}} strongly support this perception. This paper tests this hypothesis on a sample of 21 OECD countries over the period 1985 - 2003, controlling for other economic and political factors that may affect re-election. It is found that the chances of re-election for incumbent governments are not significantly affected by their record of pro-market reforms. However, the electoral impact of reform is found to differ strongly depending on which types of policies are considered. In particular, reform measures that {{are more likely to}} hurt large groups of 'insiders' seem electorally more damaging. A series of framework conditions appears to affect the impact of reforms on re-elections. Reformist governments in countries with <b>rigid</b> <b>product</b> and labour markets tend to be voted out of office, suggesting the existence of a 'rigidity trap'. While fiscal stimulus is not an effective instrument to 'sweeten the pill' and raise the odds of re-election, the presence of liberal financial markets appears to soften electoral resistance to structural reform. The latter finding is of particular relevance in the current financial crisis: forward-looking governments should not rush to over-regulate financial markets in order not to compromise the feasibility of product and labour market reforms".

The physical properties of <b>rigid</b> PVC <b>products</b> {{can be related to}} formulation, preblending and processing characteristics. A fuller understanding between these interrelations involves investigation of a complete processing system from powder additives to end product. A knowledge of these relationships can lead to a optimisation of formulation aspects and processing conditions. Fillers and lubricants have often been incorporated into PVC compounds on a empirical basis, however in this investigation a wide range of compositions were carefully chosen and included a calcium carbonate filler at levels up to 40 phr. These were dry blended and then characterised by bulk density and filler content. The premix was processed using an instrumented twin screw extruder, a wide processing 'window' being chosen to provide a product range with large variations in fusion level. Further compounds were extruded, incorporating two different impact modifiers. The extrudates was assessed for degree of fusion by differential thermal analysis, solvent immersion and microscopy. The filler distribution, surface appearance and residual grain structure was observed using a range of microscopy techniques and the results related to operating conditions. A measure of fusion level was obtained from mast er curves of heat of fusion versus processing temperature'. The filler level did not influence the degree of fusion. Various mechanical properties of the pipe were assessed. Impact performance was measured using an instrumented falling weight impact tester and the subsequent fracture behaviour depended on the composition and fusion level. Impact properties were dramatically reduced at a critical filler content and ductile-brittle transition temperatures were obtained for the extrudates by testing at low and high temperatures. Tensile properties did not follow the trends observed during impact testing but indicated a progressive reduction in tensile properties with increasing filler content...|$|R

They utilize a technology called laser sintering to streamline the prototyping process for many of their <b>rigid</b> snowboard binding <b>products.</b> Laser sintering is a manufacturing technology that takes digital files and constructs parts in three dimensions by depositing and consolidating layers of material using a laser. Currently, one of its biggest limitations is the restricted range of polymer materials that are available. The most common polymer materials used in laser sintering are Nylon- 12 or Nylon- 11. While these materials allow for the creation of robust rigid functional prototypes like snowboard binding baseplates or high backs, their ductility and elasticity is limited. The Burton product line includes many parts that demand more flexibility, especially for cold weather application such as straps, padding, or footwear components. This paper will discuss a scientific research collaboration between Loughborough University and Burton Snowboards to identify, characterize, develop, and test a new elastomer laser sintering material.

We found that the addition of 25 mole % or more of 1, 1 -dichloroethane significantly improves the fire resistance of PIR foams blown with pentanes. Small scale Mobil 45 test results show that the weight loss of 1, 1 -dichloroethane/cyclo-pentane (25 mole/ 75 mole) foams is about 40 % less than the corresponding cyclo-pentane blown foams. A further reduction of weight loss was found when more 1, 1 -dichloroethane was added. Similar results were obtained when 1, 1 -dichloroethane was used as a coblowing agent with normal pentane, iso-pentane and a mixture of cyclo-pentane/iso-pentane (50 / 50).

40|$|Lignin (wood in Latin) is {{a natural}} amorphous, {{aromatic}} polymer that acts as the essential glue and support that gives vascular plants their structural rigidity and colour. It is found mostly between but also within the plant cells and in the cell walls. Lignin consists of p-coumaryl (almost exclusively in grasses), coniferyl (common in softwoods) and sinapyl alcohol (common in hardwoods) monomers that form dimers with different linkage types depending on the types of monomer radicals combined together. As the result of lignin biosynthesis is a complex aromatic network where the Î² â€“ aryl ether (Î²-O- 4) linkage type is the most abundant one between monomer units. Within each type {{there is a lot}} of variation: lignins differ from species to species, and from one tissue to the next in the same plant [...] even within different parts of the same cell. Pulping industry separates lignin from biomass and the lignin waste is combusted on-site as energy for steam generation. Lignin is however potentially a renewable source of aromatic platform compounds that are important in other fields of industry. Many of these platform chemicals are currently obtained from fossil fuel sources. Hence there is an environmentally friendly need to develop efficient methods to convert lignin into high-value <b>products.</b> <b>Rigid</b> molecular structure of lignin and the abundant amount of hydrogen bonds in it makes it highly recalcitrant towards conventional solvents and mild reaction conditions.
