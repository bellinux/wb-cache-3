40|$|This study {{evaluated}} vaccinia-vectored vaccines expressing glycoproteins gB, gC, or gD of pseudorabies virus (PRV) in pigs. The vaccines {{are based}} on an attenuated vaccinia virus strain, NYVAC, which has reduced virulence and replicative capacity for certain species, including swine. The <b>recombinant</b> vaccinia <b>vaccines</b> were unable to prevent replication of virulent pseudorabies virus or latency but {{they were able to}} decrease the amount of virus shed after challenge and decrease clinical signs. In particular, pigs vaccinated with the recombinants expressing either gB or gD were protected at a level comparable to an inactivated PRV virus that was given for comparison. No lesions or clinical signs were seen following vaccination in these studies and no seronegative pigs in contact with vaccinia-vaccinated pigs ever seroconverted. No significant increase in protection occurred by giving recombinants expressing multiple glycoproteins and there was no virus neutralizing antibody response or protection induced when the <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> were given orally or intranasally. The response to the recombinants is dose dependent but there was no indication that prior immunity to the vaccinia parent virus had any inhibitory effect on subsequent vaccination with these recombinants. The gB recombinant, but not the gD recombinant, was able to stimulate an active immune response in piglets with passive immunity from PRV or NYVAC/gD vaccinated dams. The NYVAC/PRV <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> were compatible with differential serologic tests currently on the market. We could not demonstrate significant cell-mediated immune responses after vaccination with the <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> but they may prime this type of response. In summary, the NYVAC/PRV <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> afforded protection comparable with that of PRV vaccines currently on the market, were safe, and offer some advantages over currently available vaccines such as elimination of attenuated PRV viral strains, better induction of immunity in the presence of passive immunity, and more sensitive differential testing capabilities...|$|R

Species of Eimeria are ubiquitous where poultry are raised and are known to cause drastic reductions in performance and induce mortality, thereby affecting the overall health status of poultry. Chemotherapy has been the predominant form of disease control for many years, even though vaccination is steadily gaining importance as a feasible control method. The objective of this review is to highlight recent advancements in understanding the role of host immunity against coccidiosis. In addition, pros and cons associated with chemotherapy and the role of vaccination as an increasingly popular disease control method are discussed. Finally, the role played by <b>recombinant</b> <b>vaccines</b> as a potential vaccination tool is highlighted.
