40|$|This {{work is a}} {{study on}} the {{viability}} of the use and on the performance of thermal insulating solutions of buildings based on loose-fill lightweight granular materials. Selected products included expanded polystyrene, clay and vermiculite granules, and also others which use represents a way of recycling and adding value to waste and byproducts of several industries, such as granulated and <b>regranulated</b> <b>cork</b> and polystyrene, and autoclave cellular concrete granules. This experimental research had two components: one developed in the testing laboratory and the other on site. Laboratory testing was concerned with the fundamental properties to the viability of selected materials, namely, thermal conductivity, water and fire behaviour, settling under vibration, corrosiveness and fungal attack resistance. On site evaluation of the performance of real solutions was centered on three test cells that have been built and monitored, in order to enable the study of the application conditions, thermal resistance, hygrothermal behaviour and displacements suffered by granular thermal insulting layers aspects of the test cells performance related with the presence of the insulting materials have also been studied, such as heating energy consumption, thermal inertia and hygrothermal conditions of constructions solutions and ambiences. Complementing this research study, an overall presentation of the available loose-fill insulting materials is made, and the interest of their use is justified. Factors that most affect their behaviour are referred to, and the consequences that their use may have on different aspects of the performance of the buildings are also mentionedAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.

40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} that cork used as oil-spill sorbents, contaminated with liquid hydrocarbons, herein demonstrated with hexadecane, can be biologically treated by Rhodococcus opacus B 4 with concomitant lipids production. R. opacus B 4 consumed up to 96 % of hexadecane (C 16) impregnated in natural and <b>regranulated</b> <b>cork</b> sorbents after 48  h incubation, producing 0. 59  ±  0. 06  g of triacylglycerol (TAG) g  1 of C 16 consumed with a TAG content of 0. 60  ±  0. 06  g g  1 of cellular dry weight (CDW) and 0. 54  ±  0. 05  g TAG g  1 of C 16 consumed with a TAG content of 0. 77  ±  0. 04  g g  1 (CDW), respectively. TAG was mainly composed by fatty acids of 16 and 18 carbon chains demonstrating {{the feasibility of}} using it as raw material for biodiesel production. In addition, the obtained lipid-rich biomass (whole cells) {{can be used for}} biomethane production, at a yield of 0. 4  L CH 4 g  1 (CDW). The obtained results support a novel approach for management of oil-spill contaminated cork sorbents through its valorisation by producing bacterial lipids, which can be used as feedstocks for biofuels production.
