5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} in Europe the Australian government decided against contributing Australian forces to the occupation forces that were sent to Germany {{as part of the}} post war settlement so that it could begin the <b>repatriation</b> of the AIF early. Lieutenant General Sir John Monash was appointed Director-General of <b>Repatriation</b> and Demobilisation and oversaw the process in Britain, while Lieutenant General Henry Chauvel took charge of the efforts in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|He {{served as}} Vice-President of the Executive Council (1909–10) and Minister for Defence (1913–14) in two {{short-lived}} Liberal governments before his appointment {{as the first}} Minister for <b>Repatriation</b> in 1917. He organised the new department and co-ordinated Australia's <b>repatriation</b> effort, and was briefly acting Prime Minister in 1919, when he settled a seamen's strike. Millen resigned from the ministry in February 1923 and died later that year, his illness attributed to his heavy workload in the post-war years.|$|E

5|$|In December 1945, Hōshōs {{overhanging}} {{flight deck}} at the bow {{was cut off}} and her hangars were modified to carry more passengers. Thereafter, she undertook more <b>repatriation</b> missions beginning with one to Wewak on 5 January 1946 and subsequent trips to China. In total, the carrier made nine <b>repatriation</b> trips before 15 August 1946 and transported about 40,000 passengers.|$|E
5|$|Nauru had {{residents}} as of July , {{making it}} the second smallest sovereign state after Vatican City. The population was previously larger, but in 2006 1,500people left the island during a <b>repatriation</b> of immigrant workers from Kiribati and Tuvalu. The <b>repatriation</b> was motivated by wide-scale reductions-in-force in the phosphate mining industry. It is the least-populated country in Oceania.|$|E
5|$|<b>Repatriation</b> of Canadian internees and {{remaining}} American internees {{was announced in}} August 1943 (not all American internees had been repatriated in June 1942). Preparations similar to the prior <b>repatriation</b> were made, including messages and reports to be delivered. The ship, the Teia Maru, reached Hong Kong on 23 September, taking on board 73 Canadian internees, 24 American internees, and 13 Latin American internees. The ship sailed to Goa, where an exchange of prisoners and internees with Japan took place.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>repatriations</b> were {{agreed to}} in the Yalta Conference; Stalin claimed the repatriated people were Soviet {{citizens}} as of 1939, although {{many of them had}} left Russia before or soon {{after the end of the}} Russian Civil War, or had been born abroad. Most of those Cossacks and Russians fought the Allies in service to the Axis powers, yet the <b>repatriations</b> included non-combatant civilians as well.|$|R

5|$|The {{process of}} <b>repatriation</b> {{did not end}} there, though. Upon their return to Australia the effort shifted towards placing the {{returned}} soldiers into employment, or education {{and taking care of}} those that were too badly injured to work. In order to meet these needs the Commonwealth established the <b>Repatriation</b> Department, tasked with managing the placement of returned soldiers into employment, training, education, housing. Eventually this also included the colossal task of managing the provision of war pensions, managing <b>repatriation</b> hospitals and convalescent homes and administering the Soldier Settlement Scheme. The total cost of these provisions was considerable, and in June 1935 it was estimated to have cost approximately £238,000,000 which was more than the total amount spent on defence during the war.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the <b>repatriation</b> of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the <b>repatriation</b> and acceptance of Rosas was a success, the acceptance of the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|Downes, in {{his role}} as DGMS, pressed for the {{construction}} of major military hospitals in the capital cities. He argued that, after the war, they should be handed over to the <b>Repatriation</b> Commission for the care of sick and disabled ex-service personnel. Despite strong opposition on the grounds of cost, Downes won his case in October 1940. Time soon vindicated his judgement; and today the major military hospitals in the state capital cities, the Concord <b>Repatriation</b> General Hospital in Sydney, the Austin Hospital in Melbourne and Greenslopes Private Hospital in Brisbane remain his greatest legacy.|$|E

5|$|Former {{prisoners of}} war were given a high {{priority}} for <b>repatriation</b> back to Australia and discharge. Planning for the recovery of prisoners of the Japanese, most of whom had been held in harsh conditions, had begun in 1944 and the 2nd and 3rd Australian Prisoner of War Reception Groups were established at Singapore and Manila respectively in August 1945. By the end of September most of the prisoners recovered from Singapore, Java and Sumatra had been returned to Australia along with about half of those recovered from the Bangkok area. Transport shortages delayed the <b>repatriation</b> of Australian prisoners from Formosa, Japan and Korea, but almost all were on their way home by mid-September.|$|E
5|$|Millen {{introduced}} the Australian Soldiers <b>Repatriation</b> Bill, which provided for a paid <b>repatriation</b> commission and higher pensions for servicemen, into the Senate in March 1920. In {{response to the}} bill, and vigorous lobbying of Hughes by the veterans' movement, the bill faced difficulty in its passage and Senator Josiah Thomas successfully moved a resolution that a minister in one house might appear {{on the floor of}} the other. This bill would have allowed Millen to address the House of Representatives, where he was facing fierce criticism from the Country Party, although ultimately neither house acted on the resolution.|$|E

As a result, a Resettlement Board was established in November, and {{at a meeting of the}} Board on 8 February 1944 <b>repatriation</b> priorities were finally agreed. On 6 April 1944 the first group of 1,367repatriates arrived on the Rock directly from the United Kingdom and on 28 May, the first <b>repatriation</b> party left Madeira, and by the end of 1944 only 520non-priority evacuees remained on the island.|$|E
