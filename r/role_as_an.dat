50|$|Medea is {{generally}} {{agreed to be}} the most interesting and lifelike character in the poem yet even she may be considered unconvincing in some respects.

On the other hand, Apollonius emphasizes the technical aspect of her magical powers, such as her mastery of drugs, a touch of realism that may seem to downplay her <b>role</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sorceress.|$|R

5|$|Despite these {{frightening}} character traits, however, Edward's contemporaries {{considered him}} an able, even an ideal, king. Though not loved by his subjects, he was feared and respected. He met contemporary expectations of kingship in his <b>role</b> <b>as</b> <b>an</b> able, determined soldier {{and in his}} embodiment of shared chivalric ideals.
