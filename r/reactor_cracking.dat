Fluid Catalytic Cracking (FCC) units {{are widely used}} in the oil refining industry to crack low value hydrocarbons into a range of higher value hydrocarbons including gasoline. Because of its feed processing flexibility, the FCC process is considered a primary conversion unit in an integrated refinery and optimal FCC operation can {{have a significant impact}} on the refinery profitability. Because of its important role in the refinery, the FCC process has recently attracted renewed interest both from academia and industry, with the main emphasis on better understanding and operating the process. In general, several possible alternatives can usually be postulated or envisioned to realize operational improvements, and the critical task is then to rank order these alternatives. Rank ordering the available alternatives requires the utilization of suitable: 1. process models describing each alternative, 2. tools to quantitatively assess the operational performance achievable with each alternative. "Operational performance" here refers to the quality of closed loop process response. The different alternatives have often been analyzed and compared through extensive simulations. However, because of stringent environmental and economic requirements, most industrial plants, including the FCC process have evolved into highly complex and integrated processes and ranking through simulation might be infeasible. In ranking design alternatives through simulation, two crucial factors must be considered if the conclusions drawn from such studies are to be reasonably reliable: • Detailed case studies need to be conducted for all the alternatives. These case studies typically require considering the effect of a wide range of disturbances, inputs, operating conditions, model structures and parameters, control structures and parameters. It might be necessary to examine many hundreds if not thousands of possible alternatives. Moreover, the effect of many other aspects of practical operation such as plant/model mismatch, process constraints, sensor/actuator failures, etc. on the operational performance must also be considered for each case, and makes the assessment significantly more involved. • While qualitative "good/bad" indicators might have been sufficient in the past, it is becoming more important to quantitatively rank order the available alternatives in todays highly competitive environment. Indeed, choosing a "slightly better" alternative over a "good" alternative can {{have a significant impact on}} the sustained profitability of the process. Because of the large number of possible cases that must be considered, contradictory conclusions can often be drawn when using such an approach to rank the available alternatives. Such a simulation approach is therefore infeasible except possibly for the simplest of cases. This suggests the utilization of more efficient screening tools to effectively assess the many design alternatives possible for improved process operation while accounting for the practical considerations just discussed. With respect to the requirements (1) and (2) above for ranking the possible alternatives, we note that: 1. FCC models: The renewed interest in improved FCC operation is partially reflected by the recent publication in the open literature of two first principles models claiming to describe the essential features of the FCC process dynamics (Arbel, Huang, Rinard, Shinnar and Sapre 1995, McFarlane, Reineman, Bartee and Georgakis 1993). 2. Tools for operational performance assessment: The structured singular value (SSV) framework introduced by Doyle (1982) provides a quantitative measure of the achievable operational performance, explicitly accounts for plant/model mismatch, and also permits the approximate incorporation of many of the practical requirements indicated above into the analysis. Utilizing the two first principles FCC models and the structured singular value framework, several aspects of the design and control of FCC processes have been addressed in this thesis, with special emphasis on quantitatively ranking possible design/control options from an operational performance improvement viewpoint: 1. Model IV FCC units differ from other cracking units in that model IV FCC units do not have slide valves in the catalyst circulation lines to enable direct control of catalyst circulation rate through the unit. Reducing fluctuations in catalyst circulation rate is found to significantly improve closed loop performance of this FCC unit. Based on this process insight: (1) an operational modification: operating the regenerator with the catalyst overflow weir always flooded, and (2) a design modification: installing slide valves in the catalyst circulation U- tubes are studied and shown to reduce catalyst flow fluctuations and improve the operational performance of the FCC unit. It is interesting to note that essentially all new FCC units and revamped older FCC units typically include both the above two modifications. To reflect this current FCC operation it is assumed for all the subsequent analysis in this thesis that the above two modifications are already incorporated into the FCC design. 2. A quantitative rank ordering of possible control structures for FCC operation in both partial combustion (PC) mode and complete combustion (CC) mode operation is undertaken. It is argued that intentional transitions between the PC and CC modes is rare. For FCC units operated within design specifications, 2 x 2 control structures are found to be sufficient for effective regulatory control. In particular, it is found that high coking feeds cannot be processed in CC mode operation as the safe upper limit on regenerator temperature can be violated. For PC mode regulation, riser temperature [ [...] . ] and regenerator dense bed temperature [ [...] . ] are the most suitable choice for controlled variables. For CC mode regulation, [ [...] . ] are the most suitable choice for controlled variables, where [ [...] . ] is the flue gas [ [...] . ] molar concentration. If higher coking feeds are to be processed, the FCC would need to be refitted with additional process units, as discussed in Point 4 below. For both PC and CC modes, using feed temperature [ [...] . ] and combustion air rate [ [...] . ] as manipulated variables is found to provide operational performance levels comparable to those achieved with more conventional control structures typically used in industry (using catalyst circulation rate [ [...] . ] and combustion air rate). That feed temperature can be an effective manipulated variable can have significant implications for the improved operation of older FCCs (e. g. the Model IV) where catalyst circulation rate cannot be directly manipulated. 3. Decentralized regulatory control of the FCC unit operating in PC mode is examined in detail. Decentralized PI controllers are considered, as they are most often used in the industrial setting. It is found that (1) Decentralized PI controllers can provide satisfactory regulation over the normal FCC operating range. (2) A common regulatory control strategy for PC mode operation is to use decentralized PI controllers for the pairing [ [...] . ](notation in Point 2). It is shown that "tightening" the two PI controllers in fact reduces the process interactions and improves operational performance. This is counterintuitive - typically, detuning the controllers is expected to reduce process interactions and improve performance. (3) Certain FCC operating points are unstable. In the absence of control action, the FCC process would either drift to a stable operating point at a higher regenerator temperature or wind down to the cold state (negligible regenerator combustion and <b>reactor</b> <b>cracking).</b> It is shown that reasonable transitions to unstable operating points can be effectively handled with an appropriately tuned decentralized PI controller. (4) A theoretical development that provides insight into possible changes in the sign of the steady—state and infinite frequency relative gain array (RGA) elements is also presented. It is found to be related to the non—minimal phase behavior of one or more of the following (a) the overall plant, (b) the individual loop transfer functions, (c) the remaining system if some controlled variable and the associated manipulated variable is removed. Stable plants for which pairing for performance can correspond to negative steady—state RGA pairings are thus identified. 4. There is a growing need in the oil refining industry to process higher coking feeds in FCC units. However, FCC units operated in the CC mode might not be able to process sufficiently high coking feeds (as discussed in Point 2 above), and would have to be refitted to accommodate this greater feed processing flexibility. The most significant operating limitation is found to be the upper limit on regenerator temperature. The two possible refitting options considered here to alleviate the impact of this constraint are: (1) converting to partial combustion mode (PC mode) operation by installing a CO boiler and (2) extending complete combustion mode (CCE mode) operation by installing a catalyst cooler. The main objective is to compare the steady—state and dynamic characteristics of these two refitting options. From a steady state viewpoint, it is found that installing the catalyst cooler has a distinct advantage over installing the CO boiler when processing high coking feeds - because the regenerated catalyst is always clean burned. In particular, the product yields as well as overall conversions are typically higher. A comparison of dynamic characteristics suggests that while a simple decentralized control strategy provides satisfactory performance over a wide operating regime in PC mode, a more sophisticated control strategy might be required to achieve tight control over a comparable operating range in CCE mode with the catalyst cooler...|$|E

Specifically, it has been demonstrated {{with the use of a}} gas-liquid and gas-only jet that an optimum distance exists between the nozzle and draft tube for entrainment of solids. For both cases, this optimal distance occurs as the jet touches the draft tube wall. However, for a gas-only jet this occurs at a shorter distances due to the increased angle of expansion.

30|$|Generally, various {{reactions}} such as catalytic cracking, thermal cracking, hydrogen transfer, isomerization and condensation reactions {{occur in}} the FCC <b>reactor.</b> Catalytic <b>cracking</b> is preferred over thermal cracking for maximum propylene production. As {{the severity of the}} FCC increases, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propylene production increase as well. Therefore, maximum propylene production in FCC units is achieved by operating at high reaction temperature, short residence time and high catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratio for a given feed and catalyst system. Catalyst back-mixing occurs in conventional FCC up-flow reactor systems, where the catalyst rises upwards by drag forces of the vaporized hydrocarbons, thereby allowing for the production of undesirable by products [2].|$|R

Typical concentrations of sulphates and other anions in the primary water are of the order of 1 ppb. The values can increase temporarily to much higher values during chemical transients.

Dust formation associated with evaporation and liquid or solid particles emission are also serious issues to influence plasma contamination. In order to estimate the lifetime of the components during above mentioned events (ELMs, disruptions, VDEs), the thermal erosion mechanisms and performance of carbon-based and high Z materials have been investigated using energetic electron beam facilities. Moreover, a thorough calibration of an electron beam in the high heat flux facility JUDITH was done. For the evaluation of erosion data obtained in different test facilities several factors {{have to be taken}} into account. Different material erosion processes at identical heat loads induced by different facilities take place due to different beam generation and beam modes (static/scanned beam). The different degradation processes were created by different surface tensions and vapor recoil pressures at local spots in the loaded area. Molten and re-solidified material remained within the loaded area by fast scanning of the electron beam in JUDITH, which leaded to a rippling surface. Erosion scenarios have been elucidated on pure W and carbon-based materials. For W, the thermal erosion is initiated by convection of melt, strong evaporation or boiling processes. Moreover the formation of a vapor cloud was observed in the simulation experiments indicating vapor shielding on the surface. From screening tests on different high Z materials, pure W was found to show the highest resistance against thermal shock under plasma disruption conditions and are suitable for the components in Tokamak fusion reactors. A castellated structure was found to help reducing crack formation compared to monolithic structure. For carbon-based materials (isotropic graphite, carbon fiber composites (CFCs), Si-doped CFC), material erosion in different particle emission regimes, and characterization of emitted particles have been studied. "Small" and "Big" particle emission regimes have been identified under brittle destruction, which represents the combined action of sublimation, crack formation and ejection of solid particles. These regimes were related to the ejected particle size and maximum erosion depth. The resulting erosion patterns on the test samples and the morphology of the ejected particles differ significantly for the three materials.

Results are presented for the pyrolysis of 1, 2 -di hydronaphthalene, perhydronaphthalene and perhydroindan between 700 and 900 °C at atmospheric pressure {{in a stream}} of nitrogen as the inert carrier gas and with a residence time of 0. 5 s in the <b>reactor.</b> The <b>cracking</b> of decalin, perhydronaphthalene, gives high yields (up to 30 % by weight) of BTX, more than 20 % ethylene and 15 – 20 % methane. In contrast, the pyrolysis of 1, 2 -dihydronaphthalene or of tetralin resulting from only partial hydrogenation of naphthalene, gives very small yields of benzene and other light aromatics. The main reaction is dehydrogenation and the re-formation of naphthalene. It {{has been shown that}} the complete hydrogenation of naphthalene makes it possible to break one of the two rings between 750 and 850 °C and to produce simultaneously significant amounts of ethylene and light aromatics. The same phenomena have been observed in the pyrolysis of perhydroindan and other completely hydrogenated polyaromatic compounds. It can be concluded that complete hydrogenation causes the stability of the rings, which is characteristic of polyaromatics, to disappear. The industrial interest of the results obtained lies in the simultaneous {{production of}} light aromatics and ethylene from perhydropolyaromatic compounds formed by the hydrogenation of coal. © 1980, All rights reserved.

After the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) allowed Davis-Besse to delay shutting down to inspect its <b>reactor</b> vessel for <b>cracked</b> tubing, the plant found that leakage from these tubes had caused extensive corrosion on the vessel head [...] a vital barrier preventing a radioactive release. GAO determined (1) why NRC did not identify and prevent the corrosion, (2) whether the process NRC used in deciding to delay the shutdown was credible, and (3) whether NRC is taking sufficient action {{in the wake of}} the incident to prevent similar problems from developing at other plants. ...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, TEM has become a {{powerful}} technique to study cracks and specially crack tips. However, the number of publications including TEM results has not grown as it was expected. The main reason for this might be difficulties in the sample preparation. In this work we present a novel FIB sample preparation technique which {{has proved to be}} an ideal tool for preparing cross sectional samples containing crack tips. The morphology of intergranular stress corrosion cracking (IGSCC) has been investigated in Alloy 600 subjected to constant load and slow strain rate tests in simulated primary circuit pressurized water <b>reactor</b> conditions. <b>Cracks</b> were observed to nucleate at high-angle grain boundaries and propagate to depths of a few tens of micrometer along such boundaries, still in the initiation stage. Electron diffraction, energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) have been used to identify the different corrosion products and precipitates. Elemental mapping was employed to reveal changes in composition in the crack tip area. Major observations at cracks and grain boundaries include: the presence of different oxides in different locations, differences in grain boundary oxides and open crack/free surface oxides. These observations suggest that IGSCC involves oxygen diffusion through a porous oxide region along grain boundaries to the bare metal. This is a novel concept that offers an alternative to previous mechanisms proposed in the literature e. g. H embrittlement, slip-dissolution, etc., for which no supporting evidence has been found. </p...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the earlier}} work {{presented}} {{in the area of}} on-line fault diagnosis focuses on knowledge based and qualitatively reasoning principles and attempts to present possible root causes and consequences in terms of various measured data. However, there are many unmeasurable operating variables in chemical processes that define the state of the system. Such variables essentially characterise the efficiency and really need to be known in order to diagnose possible malfunction and provide a basis for deciding on appropriate action to be taken by operators. This paper is concerned with developing a soft sensor to assist in on-line fault diagnosis by providing information on the critical variable that is not directly accessible. The features of dynamic trends of the process are extracted using a wavelet transform and a qualitative interpretation, and then are used as inputs in the neural network based fault diagnosis model. The procedure is illustrated by reference to a refinery fluid catalytic <b>cracking</b> <b>reactor.</b> (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
