Originally {{developed for the}} iron ore industry, the Helix Dumper system can handle many types of fine-grained and potentially sticky commodities.When the Helix Dumper wagon enters the unloading area, a wheel {{at the top of}} the wagon makes contact with the spiral-shaped <b>rigid</b> <b>guide</b> that constitutes the unloading station. As the wheel travels along the path of the guide, the wagon chassis remains on the rails while the body of the wagon is rotated 148 degrees to dump its load.

40|$|RNA polymerases (RNAP) {{carry out}} transcription, {{the first step}} in the highly {{regulated}} process of gene expression. RNAPs are complex multisubunit enzymes, which undergo extensive structural rearrangements during the transcription cycle (initiation−elongation−termination).

Here we focused on the RNAP−F/E subcomplex, which forms a stable heterodimer that binds the nascent RNA and thereby stimulates the processivity of elongation complexes. We used the pulsed-EPR method DEER and fluorescence spectroscopy to probe for conformational changes within the F/E dimer. Our results demonstrate that, upon binding of RNA, F/E remains in a stable conformation, which suggests that it serves as a structurally <b>rigid</b> <b>guiding</b> rail for the growing RNA chain during transcription...|$|R

The main design requirement of such manipulators is to minimize link dynamic deflection and its active end vibrations, and obtain high position accuracy during its high speed motion.

40|$|Internationally, {{there are}} two types of headforms used for impact {{attenuation}} testing of motorcycle helmets. These two types of test headforms follow specifications established by the International Standards Organization (ISO), or the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Both headforms are low resonance, rigid castings, but they differ in size, shape and weight. The headforms are supported by a <b>rigid</b> <b>guide</b> assembly that limits their motion to the vertical direction only. Different impact locations are obtained by adjustment of the headform on a spherical ball joint. Performance criteria are based on acceleration time history measurements from a uniaxial accelerometer located at the headform center of mass. A second variation on the IS 0 headform is found in some European helmet standards that utilize an unrestrained headform instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer. These constrained headforms respond to impact with motion in many directions and performance criteria are based on the resultant of three axis acceler-ation time histories. Impact attenuation tests were performed on 180 motorcycle helmets of three different designs and under environmental conditions specified by helmet performance standards. Selected tests were recorded on high-speed (1000 Hz) videotape for motion analysis. Test apparatus designs differ greatly and guided free-fall apparatus with restrained headforms produces consistently more rigorous tests than apparatus without headform guide or restraint.

40|$|The {{temporary}} or supplementary thread {{has been}} {{employed as a}} supportive structure {{in the manufacture of}} utilitarian and decorative woven textiles for over a hundred years. First developed by wool cleaners and finishers during the mid 19 th century, the technique has been repeatedly employed to aid innovative yarn and fabric development by some of the textile industry’s leading engineers. The devoré technique, also known as burn out, developed from this temporary thread process during the late 1880 s. The popularity of devoré with textiles engineers reached its peak in the 1920 s when a period of high decoration coincided with innovation in new artificial fibers such as viscose rayon and cellulose acetate. The post war resurgence in textile engineering and fashion designing during the Art Deco period engendered numerous highly decorative devoré and temporary thread processes that utilized metallic, rayon, wire and latex threads. Fabric Innovation from Established Processes The devoré procedure of chemically removing single or multiple fibers from a constructed fabric {{can be traced to the}} wool cleaning industries of the mid to late 19 th century and the carbonizing treatment, employed to remove plant debris trapped within wool fleece. By treating wool in sulphuric acid solution, contaminating plant matter was reduced to dust when the wool was heated. The earliest forms of woven devoré follow the same principle of destruction, only the plant matter was replaced with cotton threads constructed within a wool woven textile. Initially it was American and European yarn manufacturers who recognised the economic potential of the temporary thread technique. Delicate wool fibers were twisted (spun) with a cotton thread which acted as a secure <b>rigid</b> <b>guide</b> during fabric construction. The earliest forms of fabric patterning using carbonizing treatments favored localised thread removal using printed carbonising pastes, whereupon cotton or linen threads previously twisted with wool or silk threads, and used for the warp or weft (or both), were burnt away revealing delicate lace-like open work effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with information structures used in rigid formations of autonomous agents that have leader-follower architecture. The focus of the paper is on sensor/network topologies to secure control of rigidity. This papers extends the previous rigidity based approaches for formations with symmetric neighbor relations to include formations with leader-follower architecture. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for rigidity of directed formations, with or without cycles. We present the directed Henneberg constructions as a sequential process for all <b>guide</b> <b>rigid</b> digraphs. We refine those results for acyclic formations, where <b>guide</b> <b>rigid</b> formations had a simple construction. The analysis in this paper confirms that acyclicity is not {{a necessary condition for}} stable rigidity. The cycles are not the real problem, but rather the lack of guide freedom is the reason behind why cycles have been seen as a problematic topology. Topologies that have cycles within a larger architecture can be stably rigid, and we conjecture that all <b>guide</b> <b>rigid</b> formations are stably rigid for internal control. We analyze how the external control of guide agents can be integrated into stable rigidity of a larger formation. The analysis in the paper also confirms the inconsistencies that result from noisy measurements in redundantly rigid formations. An algorithm given in the paper establishes a sequential way of determining the directions of links from a given undirected rigid formation so that the necessary and sufficient conditions are fulfilled...|$|R

40|$|Orthopaedic {{surgeons}} can be {{assisted by}} Patient Specific Surgical Guides (PSSGs) during {{the determination of}} prostheses’ alignment in joint replacement surgeries. These guides are designed preoperatively – using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computer Tomography (CT) – to have a matching contact surface with the patient’s bone. This enables the surgeon to place the guide in a uniquely planned position intraoperatively. Saw slots and drill holes are incorporated in PSSGs to create the crucial saw planes and drill holes for prostheses positioning. Tissues not detected by MRI or CT cannot be accounted for {{in the design of}} the guide’s matching surface. When such undetected tissues are present at the bone contact, they can introduce a positional error of the surgical guide. In our study multiple concepts are created which possibly decrease the positional error. The choice is made to develop a rigid and a compliant pin-based guide. Pin-based guides are configurable and thus suitable for multiple patients, since a patient-specific fit can be created. When relatively much contact points are used for the fit, compliant pins are able to absorb local irregularities. Therefore, a compliant guide can result in a lower positional error when a contact is placed onto an undetected tissue. Using more contact points will increase the ability of a compliant guide to result in a lower positional error. The two guide types are compared to their sensitivity to bony deviations in an experimental validation. The guides are placed onto a printed distal femur bone model with bony deviations. The actually reached position is measured using the optical tracking system Qualisys and is compared to the obtained position without bony deviations. For each guide four contact sets are tested to investigate the effect of the number of contact points. For validation of the experimental data, the positional error is calculated for the <b>rigid</b> <b>guide</b> with six contact points using an analytical model. Analysis of the measurement data results in a significantly lower rotational error for compliant guides compared to rigid guides. No significance is found between the translations of the two guide types. Further development of the compliant guide can be considered, since a significantly lower rotational error is obtained.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} {{reported}} that range measurement inconsistency, or equivalently mismatches in prescribed inter-agent distances, may prevent the popular gradient controllers from <b>guiding</b> <b>rigid</b> formations of mobile agents to converge to their desired shape, and even worse from standing still at any location. In this paper, instead of treating mismatches as the source of ill performance, we take them as design parameters and show that by introducing such a pair of parameters per distance constraint, distributed controller achieving simultaneously both formation and motion control can be designed that not only encompasses the popular gradient control, but more importantly allows us to achieve constant collective translation, rotation or their combination while guaranteeing asymptotically no distortion in the formation shape occurs. Such motion control results are then applied to (a) the alignment of formations’ orientations and (b) enclosing and tracking a moving target. Besides rigorous mathematical proof, experiments using mobile robots are demonstrated to show the satisfying performances of the proposed formation-motion distributed controller...|$|R
30|$|The TVT procedure, being a suburethral sling operation, {{carries the}} hazard of bladder {{penetration}} [1 – 3]. This complication, although relatively frequent, is widely {{accepted as a}} mild surgical complication because it necessitates only 24 -h drainage and no further surgical measures for damage repair or bleeding control. Failure to detect and correct this operative complication may lead to dysuria and recurrent urinary tract infection, urinary calculi formation, and a reduced therapeutic success rate. Hence, as with other urinary incontinence corrective surgery techniques, diagnostic cystoscopy is mandatory during this procedure. This provides immediate recognition and correction of TVT bladder penetration, ensuring that this surgical complication is kept within acceptable limits. Reported here are 68 out of 524 TVT patients (13 %) diagnosed and treated successfully for bladder penetration. A reduction in the penetration rate from 24 % (12 patients) in the first 50 operated patients to 6 % (three patients) in the last 50 operated patients indicates that the surgeon’s experience may have a reductive influence on TVT bladder penetration. Ulmsten et al., in their original report of the TVT procedure, advocated introducing a straight inserter into the Foley catheter before placing the needle {{in order to reduce}} the bladder penetration rate. Although reasonable, this recommendation was never challenged. The data reported here place doubt on the necessity of this step when an experienced surgeon performs the TVT. Because this is a series study and the last 50 patients did not have the <b>rigid</b> catheter <b>guide,</b> the surgeon’s learning curve might be a confounding variable responsible for the decline in the bladder penetration rate. Therefore, these data should be confirmed by a double-armed study before adopting a change in procedure.|$|R
40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 DM) {{is frequently}} {{regarded as a}} disease of obesity and its occurrence in individuals of normal body mass index (BMI) is often regarded as indicating a non-obesity-related subtype. However, the evidence for such a distinct, common subtype is lacking. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) cohort of people diagnosed with T 2 DM in the 1970 s and 1980 s had a median BMI of only 28  kg/m 2. UKPDS data {{form the basis of}} current understanding of the condition even though one in three of those studied had a BMI of less than 25  kg/m 2. BMI, though, is a population measure and not a <b>rigid</b> personal <b>guide.</b> Weight loss is considered de rigueur for treating obese diabetic individuals, but it is not usually considered for those deemed to have a normal BMI. Given the new evidence that early T 2 DM can be reversed to normal glucose tolerance by substantial weight loss, it is important to explain why non-overweight people respond to this intervention as well as obese individuals. We hypothesize that each individual has a personal fat threshold (PFT) which, if exceeded, makes likely the development of T 2 DM. Subsequent weight loss to take the individual below their level of susceptibility should allow return to normal glucose control. Crucially, the hypothesized PFT is independent of BMI. It allows both understanding of development of T 2 DM in the non-obese and remission of diabetes after substantial weight loss in people who remain obese by definition. To illustrate this concept, we present the distribution curve of BMI at diagnosis for the UKPDS cohort, together with a diagram explaining individual behaviour within the population. The concept of PFT is of practical benefit in explaining the onset of diabetes and its logical management to the non-obese majority of people with T 2 DM...|$|R
40|$|New {{approach}} to preventing long acupuncture needles from buckling and contamination during insertion In acupuncture practice, inserting a long needle (with its shaft measuring 40 mm or more) by only holding the needle handle without touching the shaft represents a significant chal-lenge. The long fine needle shaft can easily bend (also known as ‘buckle’) during insertion. Although one may use a guide tube or a needle inserter {{to help the}} initial insertion, buckling will still occur when advancing the needle in soft tissue to reach the depth required for therapeutic effect. In a recent study we reported that the buckling of the acupuncture needle could be significantly reduced by changing the design of its handle. 1 However, {{as shown in figure}} 1 A–C, it is impossible to prevent long needles from buckling by simply having a stiffer handle, even after using conventional guide tubes for the initial insertion. Consequently, some clinicians use the other hand to hold {{the lower part of the}} needle shaft to assist further insertion. However, this approach would violate the guide-lines for clean and safe clinical prac-tice of acupuncture stipulated by the WHO, the Chinese Medicine Board of Australia and other professional bodies. 2 – 5 There have been previous attempts to solve the buckling problem, a notable example being the invention of a ‘puncturing guid-ance tube’. 6 This consists of a cylin-drical body with two parts of different diameters. The upper portion has a large diameter with a funnel-shaped rim at the top which allows the needle to be put through easily. The lower portion, with a small diameter, is to prevent the Figure 1 Commonly used acupuncture needles and guide tube: (A) needle with copper coil handle; (B) needle with plastic handle; (C) needle with stainless steel handle; (D) <b>rigid</b> plastic <b>guide</b> tube...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{considers}} {{the transmission of}} sound waves through a layer of fluid or solid contained in a wave-guide of a simple form. The main aim {{is to find the}} transmission coefficient for a lowest order incident mode and to fine the lengths of the layer for which the transmission is a maximum or minimum. The first part of the thesis gives the exact solution for transmission through a layer of inviscid fluid, and for transmission through a layer of viscous fluid when the boundaries of the <b>guide</b> are <b>rigid</b> and lubricated. It also gives approximate solutions for transmission through a layer of viscous fluid when the boundaries of the guide are pressure-free and when they are rigid but not lubricated. The second part of the thesis considers transmission through a layer of solid. It gives the exact solution, in infinite series form, to the problem of the transmission of any incident waveguide mode through a stretched membrane contained in a <b>rigid</b> circular <b>guide.</b> It is shown that above a certain frequency an incident plane wave can never be completely transmitted or completely reflected. Below this frequency complete transmission or reflection can occur, but the frequencies at which it does occur depend on the medium surrounding the membrane. The solution is discussed and results are given for a particular case and compared with approximate solutions obtained by other authors. The same analysis is applied to transmission through a thin plate. The second part of the thesis also contains work on transmission through a thick layer of elastic solid. An exact solution is found using an approximate equation of motion for the solid which should be valid at low frequencies. An attempt is made to find a solution based on the exact equations for the solid, but it is necessary to use an approximation...|$|R
40|$|The 2004 {{edition of}} Austroads <b>rigid</b> {{pavement}} design <b>guide</b> {{has been based}} on the work of Packard and Tayabji (1985) which is known as the PCA method. In this method, a number of input parameters are needed to calculate the required concrete base thickness based on the cumulative damage process due to fatigue of concrete and erosion of subbase or subgrade materials. While the PCA method has been known as the most widely used mechanistic design procedure for rigid pavement, it has a number of limitations. This paper reviews the 2004 design guide, introduces a design software specifically developed to study the guide and highlights some important points. In addition, a finite element program EverFE 2. 23 has been used to determine the critical configuration and position of axle groups. Results of the current study show the complex interdependence of the many parameters. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the critical location of axle groups on pavement is not as simple as described in the guide but depends on the boundary condition between concrete base and subbase as well as the temperature and moisture gradients within the depth of the concrete base...|$|R
