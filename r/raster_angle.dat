The objective of this project was to conduct additive manufacturing to produce aircraft engine components by Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), using commercially available polyetherimides-Ultem 9085 and experimental Ultem 1000 mixed with 10 % chopped carbon fiber. A property comparison between FDM-printed and injection molded coupons for Ultem 9085, Ultem 1000 resin and the fiber-filled composite Ultem 1000 was carried out. Furthermore, an acoustic liner was printed from Ultem 9085 simulating conventional honeycomb structured liners and tested in a wind tunnel. Composite compressor inlet guide vanes were also printed using fiber-filled Ultem 1000 filaments and tested in a cascade rig. The fiber-filled Ultem 1000 filaments and composite vanes were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and acid digestion to determine the porosity of FDM-printed articles which ranged from 25 to 31 %. Coupons of Ultem 9085, experimental Ultem 1000 composites and XH 6050 resin were tested at room temperature and 400 F to evaluate their corresponding mechanical properties.

40|$|In {{rough milling}} of {{sculptured}} surface parts, decisions on process parameters concern feedrate, spindle speed, cutting speed, width of cut, <b>raster</b> pattern <b>angle</b> {{and number of}} machining slices of variable thickness. In this paper three rough milling objectives are considered: minimum machining time, maximum removed material and maximum uniformity of the remaining volume {{at the end of}} roughing. Owing to the complexity of the modelled problem and the large number of parameters, typical genetic algorithms cannot achieve global optima without defining case-dependent constraints. Therefore, to achieve generality, a hierarchical game similar to a Stackelberg game is implemented in which a typical Genetic Algorithm functions as the leader and micro-Genetic Algorithms as followers. In this game, one of the leader's parameters is responsible for creating a follower's population and for triggering the optimisation. After properly weighing the three objectives, the follower performs single-objective optimization in steps and feeds the leader back with the objective values as they appear prior to weighing. Micro-Genetic Algorithm (follower) chromosome consists of the distribution of machining slice thickness, while the typical Genetic Algorithm (leader) consists of the milling parameters.

40|$|Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM) is an {{additive}} manufacturing {{process by which}} a 3 D object is created from plastic filament. Single extruder is commonly used nowadays,but there are several researcher in company had make a inovation to this technology which are the two extruder can print with two material and colors. This concept of this development are developed by several manufacturers such as Flashforge,Leapfrog, Marketbot, Duplicator and other machines {{that have been developed}} by using multiple extrusion and two type materials. The study is focusing on the cabality of singning and joining two different material that often used in the RP especially foor FDM method which are PLA and ABS material. Each of the materials have the different temperature for bed and print. Hence, the main strength of this project is to identify, evaluate and do analysis on the joining of different materials in one sample or product by using the dual extrusion of machine. Two type of joining are used in this study which are Butt joint and Lap joint. The paramater used are Infill,air gap and <b>raster</b> <b>angle</b> is fixed to 10 %,spare and 45 /- 45. Sample for tetsing will follow the ASTM 638 Tensile test and Iso 718 for flexural test. Flexural test,ABS and PLA is the most flexural compared to others,whice are maximum value Force is 65 N and for strok is 7. 5 mm,and for the tensile test ABS and ABS with butt joint are the most high value which are maximum value for Stress 27 MPA and for the strain is 5 %. The result show that combination of PLA with ABS are not so similar with the combination of ABS and ABS. The result is based on the data by using UTM machine...|$|E
40|$|Fused {{deposition}} modeling is one {{of rapid}} prototyping system that produces prototypes from plastic materials such as ABS (acrylonitrile-butadiene-styrene) by laying the tracks of semi-molten plastic filament onto a platform in a layer-wise manner from bottom to top. The present work attempts experimental investigations to study influence of important process parameters viz., layer thickness, part orientation, <b>raster</b> <b>angle,</b> air gap and raster width along with their interactions on dimensional accuracy of Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) processed part. The part produced from FDM machine does not match with dimension of CAD model due to presence of shrinkage. However, shrinkage is more prominent in length and width direction but a positive deviation is observed in thickness direction. It is essential to study the effect of each parameter on responses such as percentage change in length, width, and thickness of specimen. A design of experiment (DOE) is used to study the effect of process parameters on responses. Optimum parameters setting to minimize percentage change in length, width and thickness of standard test specimen have been found out using Taguchi’s parameter design. Experimental results indicate that optimal factor settings for each performance characteristic are different. There are number of techniques available for predicting responses using input parameters e. g. genetic algorithm, artificial neural network, fuzzy inference system (FIS) etc. But present work uses Fuzzy Inference System (Mamdani Fuzzy logic) to predict the dimensional accuracy in part produced by FDM machine. This method is capable of {{taking into account the}} uncertainty and impreciseness in measurements which is commonly encountered in shop floor. The model uses all input and output variables in linguistic terms enabling it convenient for practitioners. The inference engine in Mamdani type FIS uses rules which are obtained with help of design of experiment technique (DOE) ...|$|E
40|$|Rapid {{prototyping}} (RP) {{technology is}} currently receiving huge attention as a prospective alternative {{to replace the}} conventional wax material as a master pattern in the investment casting (IC) process. This is because the RP technology allows simple to complex patterns to be fabricated directly from a computer model in a shorter time without using any hard tooling. However, quality of the RP patterns remains to be solved due to the staircase effect caused by the layered building method. Additionally, inappropriate settings of the RP parameters and the IC process variables such as pattern structure designs, shell preparation and burnout temperature may cause serious defects in the ceramic mould. This study was undertaken to investigate the use of RP patterns from three RP technologies in the IC process. These RP technologies include fused deposition modeling (FDM), multijet modeling (MJM) and 3 D Printer (3 DP) using acrylonitrile butadine styrene (ABS), SR 200 acrylate and ZP 150 powder based materials respectively. Experiments were conducted to assess {{the influence of the}} process parameters on the quality of RP patterns using design of experiment (DOE) method in order to obtain the best RP process parameters in minimizing the RP responses such as dimensional accuracy (DA), surface roughness (SR) and build time (BT). In addition, the effects of the internal pattern structures {{on the quality of the}} ceramic shell moulds that are suitable for the IC process were also evaluated and analysed. Based on the results of analysis of variance (ANOVA), it was found that layer thickness (LT) and road width (RW) for FDM, LT and shell value core (SVC) for 3 DP and part orientation (PO) for MJM were significant parameters affecting the DA. Findings also showed that LT, PO, air gap (AG) and RW for FDM, PO and part position (PP) for MJM, LT and SVC for 3 DP significantly affect the part SR. It was observed that LT, <b>raster</b> <b>angle</b> (RA), PO and interaction of LT and PO for FDM, LT and PO for 3 DP, PO and PP for MJM were significant parameters influencing the part BT. Results from the main effects plot indicated that all significant parameters should be set at low level in order to obtain better DA and SR. In addition, all significant parameters for FDM and 3 DP should be set at high level and MJM at low level to achieve faster part BT. Empirical models for the RP responses were established based on the experimental data using the regression equation and can be readily applied to predict the respective responses. Comparing the results of different RP part internal structures and the casting parts, it was observed that the part with internal structure produces the lowest deviation of 0. 006 mm on DA compared to hollow structure of 0. 013 mm. However internal structure had no significant effect on part SR and at the same time also resulted in longer process time. It was also found that the optimum shell thickness of ST 3, ST 2 and ST 1 for ABS, acrylate SR 200 and ZP 150 powder based materials can minimise the occurrence of shell cracking of the IC ceramic mould...|$|E
