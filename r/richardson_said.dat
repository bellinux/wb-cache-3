500|$|The {{production}} spent $4 {{million to}} restore Dealey Plaza to 1963 conditions. Stone utilized {{a variety of}} film stocks. <b>Richardson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "It depends {{whether you want to}} shoot in 35 or 16 or Super 8. In many cases the lighting has to be different." [...] For certain shots in the film, Stone employed multiple camera crews shooting at once, using five cameras {{at the same time in}} different formats. <b>Richardson</b> <b>said</b> of Stone's style of direction, [...] "Oliver disdains convention, he tries to force you into things that are not classic. There's this constant need to stretch." [...] This forced the cinematographer to use lighting in diverse positions and rely very little on classic lighting modes. The shoot lasted 79 days with filming finished five months before the release date.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Richardson {{revealed}} that executive producer Lucy Allan {{was going to}} return Ste to his [...] "bad" [...] ways. <b>Richardson</b> <b>said</b> that Ste had portrayed the whole [...] "bad thing" [...] and mellowed. He felt Ste was emulating fellow character Tony Hutchinson (Nick Pickard), because Ste was [...] "running a restaurant, camping it up like him and talking like him". Allan wanted to change that and see him regain some old habits. These changes did not happen because Allan quit her position soon after.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} shot over 15 days in Los Angeles and Malibu, California. Swanberg and cinematographer Ben Richardson decided to shoot on 35 mm film rather than digitally, {{as most of}} Swanberg's {{previous}} films had been made. They decided to shoot on film, <b>Richardson</b> <b>said,</b> because [...] "there is a certain visual integrity to a film-derived image that is still lacking for me {{in most of the}} digitally-derived imagery that we see". Although the film's dialogue was improvised, the actors rehearsed each scene before filming so that the scene could be blocked out due to the constraints of working with film rather than digital.|$|E
500|$|The song {{is carried}} by an [...] "anthemic" [...] {{sound and the}} [...] "riveting vocals" [...] of lead vocalist Dawn Michele. Bassist Wendy Drennen said that [...] "Unbreakable" [...] was about [...] "overcoming a {{defeated}} mentality and finding the power to remain strong amid the landscape, not allowing fear to hold us back from having victory over the things that used to control us". It is also lyrically based on the Biblical account of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery; the song's first line states, [...] "Where {{are the people that}} accused me?" [...] <b>Richardson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The people in charge were ready to kill her, and Jesus speaks up for her, changes their minds and makes them feel ashamed for accusing her ... She knows she’s guilty, and yet she’s suddenly free and given a second chance." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2010, {{speculation}} arose that Richardson {{would leave}} the show, due to his participation in ITV ice skating competition Dancing on Ice. <b>Richardson</b> <b>said</b> [...] "I'm not leaving, I'm staying put". He added his participation in the reality television series was for [...] "fun", and stating: [...] "I still want to stay at Hollyoaks and progress in my career there" [...] {{because he did not}} think he was a good enough actor to pursue other projects. However, he later revealed he was not sure executive producer Paul Marquess would renew his contract. In November 2010, Richardson commented on his future with the show, branding it a new era and thankful to be part of it. Richardson stated: [...] "Marquess loved everything I've been doing and wanted to keep me on. I'm hoping to stick with the show no matter what." ...|$|E

500|$|Richardson {{began the}} 1960s with a failure. Enid Bagnold's play The Last Joke was savaged by the critics ("a {{meaningless}} jumble of pretentious whimsy" [...] was one description). His {{only reason for}} playing in the piece was the chance of acting with Gielgud, but both men quickly regretted their involvement. Richardson {{then went to the}} US to appear in Sidney Lumet's film adaptation of Long Day's Journey into Night, alongside Katharine Hepburn. Lumet later recalled how little guidance Richardson needed. Once, the director went into lengthy detail about the playing of a scene, and when he had finished, <b>Richardson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Ah, I think I know what you want – a little more flute and a little less cello". After that, Lumet was sparing with suggestions. Richardson was jointly awarded the Cannes Film Festival's Best Actor prize with his co-stars Jason Robards Jr and Dean Stockwell.|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "City Girl" [...] {{received}} moderate critical acclaim. Pitchfork Media writer Mark <b>Richardson</b> <b>said</b> that [...] "on first listen {{it sounds}} like a demo of a pre-Loveless track, possibly from the You Made Me Realise era" [...] and while there was [...] "no exploration on that front … the melody and voice are familiar and welcome." [...] Writing for Stylus Magazine, Andrew Unterberger called [...] "City Girl" [...] "a worthy opener" [...] and added that [...] " [...] where Kevin's at right now—making pretty pop songs. There is so little to this song that it's almost enough to make you think Kevin's lost his mind." [...] Unterberger summarised the song as [...] "gorgeous, and definitely has that sighing quality to it that makes the film so delectable." [...] Exclaim! journalist Michael White noted that it was [...] "the indisputable highlight of the soundtrack" [...] and AllMusics Heather Phares described [...] "City Girl" [...] as an [...] "open-ended piece" [...] and [...] "naïve [...] guitar-driven" [...] but added that it did not compare to Shields' compositions on Loveless (1991).|$|E
500|$|On the tour, {{the dynamic}} nature of Bradman's batting contrasted sharply with his quiet, solitary off-field demeanour. He was {{described}} as aloof from his teammates {{and he did not}} offer to buy them a round of drinks, let alone share the money given to him by Whitelaw. Bradman spent a lot of his free time alone, writing, as he had sold the rights to a book. On his return to Australia, Bradman was surprised by the intensity of his reception; he became a [...] "reluctant hero". Mick Simmons wanted to cash in on their employee's newly won fame. They asked Bradman to leave his teammates and attend official receptions they organised in Adelaide, Melbourne, Goulburn, his hometown Bowral and Sydney, where he received a brand new custom-built Chevrolet. At each stop, Bradman received a level of adulation that [...] "embarrassed" [...] him. This focus on individual accomplishment, in a team game, [...] "...permanently damaged relationships with his contemporaries". Commenting on Australia's victory, the team's vice-captain Vic <b>Richardson</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "...we could have played any team without Bradman, but we could not have played the blind school without Clarrie Grimmett". A modest Bradman can be heard in a 1930 recording saying [...] "I have always endeavoured to do my best for the side, and the few centuries that have come my way have been achieved in the hope of winning matches. My one idea when going into bat was to make runs for Australia." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{his return}} from North Korea, Richardson dealt {{with the issue of}} a pardon for William H. Bonney, aka Billy the Kid, for killing Sheriff William J. Brady of Lincoln County, New Mexico some 130 years ago. [...] Following up on the promise of a pardon at the time by then-territorial {{governor}} Lew Wallace, <b>Richardson</b> <b>said</b> he could not pardon Bonney posthumously because {{he did not want to}} second-guess his predecessor's decision. [...] "It was a very close call", <b>Richardson</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "The romanticism appealed to me to issue a pardon, but the facts and the evidence did not support it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Richardson {{was born}} in Los Angeles and lives in Long Beach. She was raised by a single mother after her parents {{divorced}} when she was two. Her father {{was a member of}} the Teamsters.

5000|$|As {{part of a}} {{diplomatic}} mission, Richardson traveled to North Korea in early April 2007 for meetings with government officials and successfully recovered the remains of six U.S. servicemen in that country.

It follows that an allotment which is invalid under s 37(4) cannot be validated under s 7."However, as the Securities Act only prohibited validation, and not any other forms of relief, the court granted relief in the form of damages, which was similar to if validation had been granted, effectively granting validation via the back door.|$|R
