5|$|On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg {{discontinued}} {{the investigation}} as {{he found no}} basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish case law extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech {{must be taken into}} consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection</b> against discrimination, insult and degradation. In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.|$|E

25|$|Children's {{rights are}} defined in {{numerous}} ways, including {{a wide spectrum}} of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. Rights tend to be of two general types: those advocating for children as autonomous persons under the law and those placing a claim on society for protection from harms perpetrated on children because of their dependency. These have been labeled as the right of empowerment and as the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E

Nevertheless it is necessary to enunciate that social relationships are various so far, that frequently it is not in power of legislator to involve all human acting by enumerative legal regulation.

25|$|In the colonies, {{the success}} of Thomas Paine's {{pamphlet}} Common Sense had boosted public support for independence. On July 2, Congress {{voted in favor of}} independence with twelve affirmatives and one abstention, issuing its declaration on July 4. Washington read the declaration to his men and the citizens of New York on July 9, invigorating the crowd to tear down a lead statue of the King, melting it to make bullets. British Tories criticized the signatories for not extending the same standards of equality to slaves. Patriots followed independence with the Test Laws, requiring residents to swear allegiance to the state in which they lived, intending to root out neutrals or opponents to independence. Failure to do so meant possible imprisonment, exile, and, in some cases, death. American Tories were barred from public office, forbidden from practising medicine and law, forced to pay increased taxes, barred from executing wills or becoming guardians to orphans. Congress enabled states to confiscate Loyalist property to fund the war, and offered them a choice between swearing loyalty to the republic, or either face exile, or forfeit the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection.</b> Quakers, who remained neutral, had their property confiscated. States later prevented Loyalists from collecting any debts they were owed.|$|E

In November 2001, President Bush asserted authority to try captives from the War before [...] "military commissions" [...] instead of through the civilian court system. Many captives {{from the war}} were held at Camp X-Ray, which was opened at the United States' Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba in January 2002. While the United States has an indefinite lease on Guantanamo Bay, Cuba still maintained de jure sovereignty over the area. Because of the mixed jurisdiction, the Bush administration stated that the captives {{are not subject to}} American law and have no <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection</b> under the United States Constitution nor the American justice system.|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 1963, {{more than}} one hundred E-meters were seized by U.S. marshals at the [...] "Founding Church of Scientology" [...] building, now known as the L.Ron Hubbard House, located in Washington, D.C. The church was accused of making false claims that the devices {{effectively}} treated some 70 percent of all physical and mental illness. The FDA also charged that the devices did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended. Upon appeal, the E-meters were returned, with the direction that they should be used only in [...] "bona fide religious counseling", and that all meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits. In the decision, the court gave recognition to Scientology’s “constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection</b> from the government’s excessive entanglement with religion” as written by James R. Lewis, in Scientology.|$|E
2500|$|The court's ruling {{generated}} two dissents. [...] The first, by Associate Justice William Brennan, {{asserted that}} {{whether or not}} the Due Process Clause gave Joshua DeShaney a constitutional <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection</b> against abuse was a non-sequitur, since it was not an argument presented to either of the lower courts or even to the Supreme Court and [...] "no one, in short, has asked the Court [...] to proclaim that, as a general matter, the Constitution safeguards positive as well as negative liberties." [...] He {{went on to say that}} Rehnquist used a flawed interpretation of the Estelle and Youngberg precedents, which Brennan held [...] "to stand for the much more generous proposition that, if a State cuts off private sources of aid and then refuses aid itself, it cannot wash its hands of the harm that results from its inaction." [...] Finally, Brennan argued that the Wisconsin child-protection laws created a regime in which private citizens and government bodies other than a Department of Social Services had no power or role to intervene with child abuse other than notifying the DSS. [...] As such, Brennan held that the child-protection laws constituted the same custodial [...] "deprivation of liberty" [...] that Rehnquist's opinion held necessary for a Due Process violation.|$|E
40|$|Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights {{sets out}} a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> data <b>protection</b> which sits alongside, and in {{addition}} <b>to,</b> the established <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy in the Charter. The Charter's inclusion of an independent <b>right</b> <b>to</b> data <b>protection</b> differentiates it from other international human rights documents which treat data protection as {{a subset of the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy. Its introduction and its relationship with the established <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy merit an explanation. This paper explores the relationship between the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> data <b>protection</b> and privacy. It demonstrates that, to date, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) has consistently conflated the two rights. However, based on a comparison between the scope of the two rights as well as the <b>protection</b> they offer <b>to</b> individuals whose personal data are processed, it claims that the two rights are distinct. It argues that the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> data <b>protection</b> provides individuals with more rights over more types of data than the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy. It suggests that the enhanced control over personal data provided by the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> data <b>protection</b> serves two purposes: first, it proactively promotes individual personality rights which are threatened by personal data processing and, second, it reduces the power and information asymmetries between individuals and those who process their data. For these reasons, this paper suggests that there ought to be explicit judicial recognition of the distinction between the two rights...|$|R

60|$|Indeed, {{how should}} the {{principle}} of religious toleration have been acknowledged at first?--It would require stronger arguments than any which I have heard as yet, to prove that men in authority have not a right, involved in an imperative duty, to deter those under their control from teaching or countenancing doctrines which {{they believe to be}} damnable, and even to punish with death those who violate such prohibition. I am sure that Bellarmine would have had small difficulty in turning Locke round his fingers' ends upon this ground. A <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>protection</b> I can understand; but a right to toleration seems to me a contradiction in terms. Some criterion must in any case be adopted by the state; otherwise it might be compelled to admit whatever hideous doctrine and practice any man or number of men may assert to be his or their religion, and an article of his or their faith. It was the same Pope who commanded the Romanists of England to separate from the national church, which previously their own consciences had not dictated, nor the decision of any council,--and who also commanded them to rebel against Queen Elizabeth, whom they were bound to obey by the laws of the land; and if the Pope had authority for one, he must have had it for the other. The only true argument, as it seems to me, apart from Christianity, for a discriminating toleration is, that it is of no use to attempt to stop heresy or schism by persecution, unless, perhaps, it be conducted upon the plan of direct warfare and massacre. You cannot preserve men in the faith by such means, though you may stifle for a while any open appearance of dissent. The experiment has now been tried, and it has failed; and that is by a great deal the best argument for the magistrate against a repetition of it.|$|E
