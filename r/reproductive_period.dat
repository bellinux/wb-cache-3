5|$|Since camels have a {{slow growth}} rate; they reach sexual {{maturity}} only in advanced years. The age of sexual maturity varies geographically and {{depends on the}} individual, as does the <b>reproductive</b> <b>period.</b> Both sexes might mature by {{three to five years}} of age, though successful breeding could take longer. Mating occurs once a year, and peaks in the rainy season. The mating season lasts three to five months, but may last a year for older animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's <b>reproductive</b> <b>period</b> is termed menopause. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the <b>reproductive</b> <b>period.</b> Thinner pack ice over the Bering Sea has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E

40|$|Squaretail coralgrouper (Plectropomus areolatus) were {{captured}} and tagged at a fish spawning aggregation (FSA) site with conventional and acoustic tags {{to assess their}} vulnerability to fishing and spatial dynamics during <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods.</b> Males outnumbered females in catch and, on average, were larger than females. Findings revealed a high vulnerability to fishing, particularly during <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods,</b> and most fish were recaptured within the 5 -month spawning season and within 10 − 12 km of the aggregation site. Individual and sex-specific variability in movement to, and residency times at, the FSA site indicates that individual monthly spawning aggregations represent subsets of the total reproductive population. Some individuals appeared to move along a common migratory corridor to reach the FSA site. Sex-specific behavioral differences, particularly longer residency times, appear to increase the vulnerability of reproductively active males to fishing, particularly within a FSA, which could reduce reproductive output. Both fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data indicate that only males were present within {{the first month of}} aggregation. The combined results indicate that reproductively active P. areolatus are highly vulnerable to fishing and that FSAs and migratory corridors of reproductively active fish should be incorporated into marine protected areas. The capture of P. areolatus during <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods</b> should be restricted as part of a comprehensive management strate...|$|R

25|$|Globally {{dermatitis}} affected approximately 230million {{people as}} of 2010 (3.5% of the population). Dermatitis is most commonly seen in infancy, with female predominance of eczema presentations occurring during the <b>reproductive</b> <b>period</b> of 15–49 years.

25|$|The Lithobiomorpha and Scutigeromorpha {{lay their}} eggs singly in holes in the soil, and the female fills the holes with soil and leaves them. The number of eggs laid ranges from about 10 to 50. Time of {{development}} of the embryo to hatching is highly variable and may take from one to a few months. Time of development to <b>reproductive</b> <b>period</b> is highly variable within and among species. For example, it can take 3 years for S. coleoptrata to achieve adulthood, whereas under the right conditions, lithobiomorph species may reach a <b>reproductive</b> <b>period</b> in 1 year. In addition, centipedes are relatively long-lived when compared to insects. For example, the European Lithobius forficatus may live for 5 to 6 years, and the wide-ranging Scolopendra subspinipes can live for over 10 years. The combination of {{a small number of}} eggs laid, long gestation period, and long time of development to reproduction has led authors to label lithobiomorph centipedes as K-selected.|$|E
40|$|Sex steroids with thyroid hormones {{were studied}} during {{reproduction}} in the European barbel Barbus barbus L., {{a new species}} for European aquaculture. In female barbel, the period between two successive ovulations (every 12 - 18 days) was characterized by high estradiol- 17 beta (E- 2) levels (> 300 pg. ml(- 1)) and a sinusoidal variation of these levels. Outside the <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods,</b> the E- 2 plasma concentration was significantly lower (100 pg. ml(- 1)) and invariation. The spermiating males showed significantly higher testosterone (T) plasma values than non-spermiating ones. The opposite was noticed for the plasma thyroxine (T- 4) concentrations: low values in males and females during reproduction, high values outside <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods.</b> Spermiating males had a higher triiodothyronine (T- 3) plasma concentration compared to non-spermiating ones, whereas no significant difference is seen for the females.

500|$|The {{house sparrow}} {{is a very}} social bird. It is gregarious at all seasons when feeding, often forming flocks {{with other types of}} birds.

The house sparrow feeds mostly on the ground, but it flocks in trees and bushes.

This was the first study to assess plasma glucose values as an indicator of stress response to evaluate variation and the effect of reproductive activity for wild adult red drum in Florida. Red drum (n= 126) were collected from NASA's Kennedy Space Center waters during three <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods</b> in 2011. Samples were obtained from the branchial vessels of the gill arch. Plasma glucose levels were significantly different among <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods,</b> with the highest mean values recorded during the spawning period, September- October (38. 23 mg / dL +/- 10. 0).

2500|$|More recent {{research}} indicates that the [...] "common disease-rare variant" [...] {{may be a better}} explanation for many common diseases.

40|$|In many organisms {{survival}} {{depends on}} body size. We investigate {{the implications of}} size-selective mortality on life-history evolution by introducing and analysing a new and particularly flexible life-history model with the following key features: the lengths of growth and <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods</b> in successive <b>reproductive</b> cycles can vary evolutionarily, the model does not constrain evolution to patterns of either determinate or indeterminate growth, and lifetime number and sizes of broods are the outcomes of evolutionarily optimal life-history decisions. We find that small changes in environmental conditions can lead to abrupt transitions in optimal life histories when size-dependent mortality is sufficiently strong. Such discontinuous switching results from antagonistic selection pressures and occurs between strategies of early maturation with short <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods</b> and late maturation with long reproductive cycles. When mortality is size-selective and the size-independent component is not too high, selection favours prolonged juvenile growth, thereby allowing individuals to reach a mortality refuge at large body size {{before the onset of}} reproduction. When either component of mortality is then increased, the mortality refuge first becomes unattractive and eventually closes up altogether, resulting in short juvenile growth and frequent reproduction. Our results suggest a new mechanism for the evolution of life-history dimorphisms...|$|R

40|$|The polychaetous annelid Neanthes acuminata complex has a {{widespread}} distribution, with the California population {{referred to as}} N. arenaceodentata. The reproductive pattern in this complex is unique, in that the female reproduces once and then dies, whereas the male can reproduce up to nine times.

Reproductive success and protein expression patterns were measured over the nine <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods.</b> The percent success of the male in producing juveniles increased {{during the first three}} <b>reproductive</b> <b>periods</b> and then decreased, but the number of juveniles produced was similar through all nine periods. iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics were used to analyze the dynamics of protein expression patterns.
