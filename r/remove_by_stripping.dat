40|$|Bauxite residue (red mud) is a {{waste product}} of the alumina {{refining}} in the Bayer process and contains significant concentrations of critical metals, including scandium. Greek bauxite residue contains exploitable levels of scandium and is thus considered a suitable source for its production. A process was developed to recover scandium from Greek bauxite residue {{using a combination of}} sulfation-roasting-leaching and solvent extraction with the hydrophobic ionic liquid betainium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide, [Hbet][Tf 2 N]. Sulfation-roasting-leaching was the preferred leaching technique to dissolve scandium from bauxite residue because of the low acid consumption, good selectivity towards scandium and low co-dissolution of the major elements. The scandium concentration in the leachate was increased by applying multistage leaching, during which the obtained leachate is contacted multiple times with freshly roasted material. In a next step, scandium was selectively extracted from the obtained leachate with [Hbet][Tf 2 N]. To improve the separation between scandium and iron, Fe(III) was reduced to Fe(II) by addition of ascorbic acid to the sulfate leachate prior to extraction. The phase ratio and pH of the extraction were optimized to achieve high extraction and concentration of scandium in the ionic liquid phase. Co-extracted metal ions were scrubbed from the loaded ionic liquid phase by HCl and the purified scandium was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>stripping</b> with H 2 SO 4.

Since these three early-type dwarfs reside in densely crowded regions close {{to the center of}} the Virgo cluster, and several Hi-detected dwarfs in the outskirts of Virgo were not detected by Herschel(implying a dust content < 104 M⊙), this might imply that dust in dwarfs is more closely related to the molecular gas, which is more centrally peaked in a galaxy’s potential well and therefore, not easily <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> any <b>stripping</b> mechanism.

40|$|We quantitatively {{examine the}} effects of {{accretion}} and environment on the HI content of galaxies within a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that reproduces basic observed trends of HI in galaxies. We show that our model broadly reproduces the observed scatter in HI at a given stellar mass as quantified by the HI mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the HI richness versus local galaxy density. This shows that the predicted HI fluctuations and environmental effects are roughly consistent with data with few minor discrepancies. For satellite galaxies in >= 10 ^ 12 M_* halos, the HI richness distribution is bimodal and drops towards the largest halo masses. The depletion rate of HI once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid at higher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows much less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests that, up to halo mass scales probed here (<= 10 ^ 14 M_*), star formation is mainly attenuated by starvation, but HI is additionally <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>stripping</b> once a hot gaseous halo is present. In low mass halos, the HI richness of satellites is independent of radius, while in high mass halos they become gas-poor towards the center.

We show that our simulation model broadly reproduces the observed scatter in H I at a given stellar mass as quantified by the HI mass function in bins of stellar mass, as well as the H I richness versus local galaxy density. The predicted H I fluctuations and environmental effects are roughly consistent with data, though some discrepancies are present at group scales. For satellite galaxies in & 1012 Mhalos, the H I richness distribution is bimodal and drops towards the largest halo masses. The depletion rate of H I once a galaxy enters a more massive halo is more rapid at higher halo mass, in contrast to the specific star formation rate which shows much less variation in the attenuation rate versus halo mass. This suggests that, up to halo mass scales probed here (. 1014 M), star formation is mainly attenuated by starvation, but H I is additionally <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>stripping</b> once a hot gaseous halo is present. In low mass halos, the H I richness of satellites is independent of radius, while in high mass halos they become gas-poor towards the center, confirming the increasing strength of the stripping with halo mass. By tracking the progenitors of galaxies, we show that the gas fraction of satellite and central galaxiesdecreases from z = 5 ! 0, tracking each other until z⇠ 1 after which the satellites’ H I content drops much more quickly, particularly for the highest halo masses. Mergers somewhat increase the H I richness and its scatter about the mean relation, but these variations are consistent with arising form inflow fluctuations, unlike in the case of star formation where mergers boost it above that expected from inflow fluctuations. In short, our simulations suggest that the H I content in galaxies is determined by their ability to accrete gas from their surroundings, with stripping effects playing a driving role once a hot gaseous halo is present...|$|R
40|$|Systemic lupus {{erythematosus}} (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with multiple immune disturbances whose mechanisms remain unclear. We examined {{the interaction of}} antilymphocyte antibodies with cultured normal T lymphocytes. T cells were prepared by E-rosetting after petri-dish removal of adherent cells and cultured for 2 - 7 d {{in the presence of}} SLE sera or normal human sera. Cultured T cells were washed and sonicated, and the amount of cell-associated IgG was quantitated by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) methods. T cells cultured with 27 of 39 SLE sera showed marked increments of associated immunoglobulin G (IgG) although this was not observed with sera from mixed connective tissue disease patients containing high titers of ribonucleoprotein antibody or normal donors. The effective factors for IgG association in SLE sera were absorbed with normal peripheral blood lymphocytes or T cells. Anti-T cell IgG cytotoxic activity strongly correlated with T cell IgG association (P less than 0. 01). T cell-associated IgG was not <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> <b>stripping</b> of cell membrane IgG from living cells by acid buffer treatment; indirect immunofluorescence of cells fixed after 2 - 4 d of culture revealed cytoplasmic IgG staining. IgG anti-T cell antibodies appeared to associate inside the cell membrane or to penetrate into the cytoplasm of cells. T cell Fc receptor blocking by heat-aggregated IgG or anti-beta 2 -microglobulin antibody did not alter IgG cell association. Since pepsin-digested SLE sera showed no T cell association activity, whole IgG antibody molecules appeared to be necessary for interaction with cultured T cells. In addition, reduction and alkylation of active SLE sera completely nullified T cell reactivity. When normal T cells were cultured with SLE sera showing marked IgG T cell association, viability of cultured T cells decreased rapidly after 4 d, which suggests that IgG anti-T cell antibodies were associated with cell destruction.

As has been observed in both nuclear- and electron-induced single-nucleon knockout reaction analyses, the theoretical two-nucleon knockout cross sections overestimate the measured values, requiring a suppression of the two nucleon shell-model transition strengths.

Material and methodsGreat saphenous veins were <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> Babcock <b>stripping</b> and irradiated with laser energy delivered by a laser diode emitting at 980 nm. In total, 279 vein segments (5 cm long) were treated using powers from 5 – 15 W. Vein segments were opened longitudinally and the circumference measured in the treated and untreated regions to assess thermal shrinkage. ResultsThe greatest shrinkage and minimum number of perforations was achieved using lower or medium power (8 to 12 W) with longer exposure to administer laser energy. The median percentage vein shrinkage was 50 % (power 5 W), 45 % (8 W), 40 % (10 W), 45 % (12 W) and 59 % (15 W). When a higher power was used (15 W), the perforations were more frequent and carbonisation was marked. ConclusionsOur data suggests that similar efficacy with fewer vein perforations may be obtained with low or medium power settings and increased exposure when undertaking laser obliteration of saphenous trunks.

This work proposes a new methodology for the column design for any particular type of packing and contaminant avoiding the necessity of a pre-defined diameter used in the classical approach. It also renders unnecessary the employment of the graphical Eckert generalized correlation for pressure drop estimates. The hydraulic features are previously chosen as a project criterion and only afterwards the mass transfer phenomena are incorporated, in opposition to conventional approach. The design procedure was translated into a convenient algorithm using C++ as programming language. A column was built in order to test the models used either in the design or in the simulation of the column performance. The experiments were fulfilled using a solution of chloroform in distilled water. Another model was built to simulate the operational performance of the column, both in steady state and in transient conditions. It consists in a system of two partial non linear differential equations (distributed parameters). Nevertheless, when flows are steady, the system became linear, although there is not an evident solution in analytical terms.

Their permeation rates through heat-isolated epidermis and dermatomed (200 - to 250 -µm) skin sections were essentially the same. However, when the stratum corneum was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> tape <b>stripping,</b> the respective permeability coefficients were increased > 30 -fold, establishing the stratum corneum as the principal barrier to their skin permeation.

The free base is thus responsible for the relatively facile skin permeation of these drugs. Factoring of the independent permeability coefficients of the ionized and free-base forms was possible, with the latter being over two log orders larger than seen for the protonated species. Permeability coefficients of fentanyl and sufentanil through skin sections obtained from different cadavers varied four- to fivefold.

However, the lining of the skin by the stratum corneum is a major obstacle to vaccine delivery. In this study we examined the effect of skin barrier disruption on the immune responses to the cross-reacting material CRM 197, a nontoxic mutant of diphtheria toxin (DTx) that is considered as a vaccine candidate. Application of CRM 197, together with cholera toxin (CT), onto the tape-stripped skin of mice elicited antibody responses that had anti-DTx neutralizing activity. Vaccine delivery onto mildly ablated skin or intact skin did not elicit any detectable anti-CRM 197 antibodies. Mice immunized with CRM 197 alone onto the tape-stripped skin mounted a vigorous antigen-specific proliferative response. In contrast, the induction of cellular immunity after CRM 197 deposition onto mildly ablated or intact skin was adjuvant dependent. Furthermore, epidermal cells were activated and underwent apoptosis that was more pronounced when the stratum corneum was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> tape <b>stripping.</b> Overall, these findings highlight the potential for transcutaneous delivery of CRM 197 and establish a correlation between the degree of barrier disruption and levels of antigen-specific immune responses.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Hydrophilic {{drugs are}} poorly absorbed when applied topically, due to low {{partitioning}} through the lipid matrix of the stratum corneum. Cutaneous blood flow rapidly clears the absorbed drug, which {{may result in}} low tissue levels. This is of importance for topically applied drugs whose site of action is within the epidermis or dermis. Dermal drug levels can be measured using cutaneous microdialysis, which {{is a means of}} continuously sampling substances from the dermal extracellular fluid. OBJECTIVES: To measure the contribution of stratum corneum barrier and microvascular perfusion in determining dermal tissue levels of hydrophilic drugs (aciclovir and penciclovir) in vivo. METHODS: Studies were performed using microdialysis of the volar surface of the forearm of healthy volunteers (n = 55) over a 5 -h collection period. Stratum corneum was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> tape <b>stripping,</b> and barrier disruption quantified by measurement of transepidermal water loss (TEWL); dermal microvascular perfusion was modulated by inclusion of noradrenaline in the microdialysis perfusate. RESULTS: With intact skin and normal cutaneous blood flow the concentration of penciclovir recovered was below assay threshold (0. 05 ng x mL(- 1). With noradrenaline-induced local vasoconstriction, the area under the curve of drug absorbed through normal skin (+/- SEM) was 13. 3 +/- 2. 9 ng mL(- 1) h(0 - 5) for penciclovir and 27. 6 +/- 10. 6 ng mL(- 1) h(0 - 5) for aciclovir. Removal of the stratum corneum (to glistening) <b>by</b> tape <b>stripping</b> increased penciclovir absorption by 1300 -fold and aciclovir absorption by 440 -fold, confirming the stratum corneum as the major barrier to hydrophilic drug absorption. Sequential barrier disruption <b>by</b> tape <b>stripping</b> gave a close correlation between penciclovir concentration absorbed per hour and barrier disruption measured by TEWL (r 2 = 0. 9283). There was a 15. 6 -fold difference in the recovery of penciclovir through barrier-deficient skin with and without cutaneous blood flow. There was no relationship between fibre depth and amount of drug dialysed, which suggests free movement of antiviral drug on reaching the aqueous environment of the dermis. CONCLUSIONS: This study defines {{for the first time the}} relationship between the degree of mechanical barrier impairment and drug absorption at the same anatomical site in humans, and the role of blood flow in drug clearance in vivo...|$|R

Glabrous skin was sampled with a 26 -cm 2 contact plate containing Trypticase soy agar. Five antiseptic solutions and four antimicrobial ointments were evaluated. The antiseptic solutions (10 % povidone-iodine, 2 % aqueous iodine, 2 % tincture of iodine, 70 % ethanol, and 0. 5 % chlorhexidine-ethanol) were applied for 15 s with a gauze sponge. The antimicrobial ointments (iodophor, silver sulfadiazine, mupirocin, and a triple-antibiotic ointment containing neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin) were applied and covered for 6 h with gauze. After treatment, the surface was sampled, 15 to 25 keratinized layers were subsequently <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> sequential <b>stripping</b> with cellophane tape, and the stratum corneum was sampled. All agents were effective in eradicating CNS from the surface (80 of 88 trials). However, only 2 % iodine (17 of 20 trials), iodophor (8 of 12), mupirocin (6 of 10), and the triple-antibiotic ointment (9 of 11) eradicated CNS from the stratum corneum reliably (greater {{than or equal to}} 50 % of trials).

40|$|Green tea (Camellia sinensis) and Ginkgo biloba {{extracts}} in cosmetic formulations {{have been}} suggested to protect the skin against UV-induced damage and skin ageing. Thus, {{it is very important}} to assess the human skin penetration of their major flavonoids to verify if they penetrate and remain in the skin to exert their proposed effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the human skin penetration of epigallocatechin- 3 -gallate (EGCG) and quercetin from green tea and G. biloba extracts vehiculated in cosmetic formulations. This study was conducted with fresh dermatomed human Caucasian skin from abdominal surgery mounted on static Franz diffusion cells. Skin samples were mounted between two diffusion half-cells and 10 mg/cm(2) of formulations supplemented with 6 % of green tea or G. biloba extract were applied on the skin surface. The receptor fluid was removed after 6 and 24 h and analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography for the quantification of the flavonoids. The stratum corneum was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> tape <b>stripping</b> and immersed in methanol and the epidermis was mechanically separated from the dermis and triturated in methanol to extract EGCG and quercetin. The results showed that the flavonoids under study penetrated into the skin, without reaching the receptor fluid. The majority of EGCG was quantified in the stratum corneum (0. 87 mu g/cm(2)), which was statistically higher than the EGCG concentrations found in viable epidermis (0. 54 mu g/cm(2)) and in the dermis (0. 38 mu g/cm(2)). The majority of quercetin was quantified in the viable epidermis (0. 23 mu g/cm(2)), which was statistically higher than the EGCG concentration found in the stratum corneum layer (0. 17 mu g/cm(2)). Finally, it can be concluded that EGCG and quercetin from green tea and G. biloba extracts vehiculated in cosmetic formulations presented good skin penetration and retention, which can favor their skin effects.

40|$|Identification and treatment/elimination {{of point}} sources of mercury (Hg) to East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC) within the Y- 12 Plant have reduced base flow mercury {{concentrations}} considerably; but, after all such actions are completed, nonpoint sources {{will continue to}} add mercury to the creek. Studies conducted in 1996 {{on the use of}} air stripping to remove elemental mercury from Outfall 51, a mercury-contaminated natural spring, demonstrated that the addition of trace concentrations of stannous chloride (SnCl{sub 2 }) converted a large fraction of the dissolved mercury in the outfall to elemental mercury, which could subsequently be <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> air <b>stripping.</b> Dissolved mercury is the dominant form in EFPC at the north/south (N/S) pipes, where it emerges from the underground storm drain network. More than 50 % of that mercury is capable of being rapidly reduced by the addition of a 3 [...] 5 fold molar excess of stannous chloride. Upon conversion to the volatile gaseous (elemental) form, mercury would be lost across the air-water interface through natural volatilization. EFPC within the Y- 12 Plant is shallow, turbulent, and open to sunlight and wind, providing conditions that facilitate natural evasion of volatile chemicals from the water. Preliminary calculations estimate that 75 % or more of the elemental mercury could be removed via evasion between the N/S pipes and the Y-l 2 Plant boundary (Station 17). Alternatively, elemental mercury might be removed from EFPC in a short reach of stream below the N/S pipes by an in-situ air stripping system which bubbles air through the water column. The purpose of these proposed experiments is to test whether natural volatilization or in-situ air stripping may be used to further reduce baseflow concentrations of mercury in EFPC. Results of this experiment will be useful for understanding the transport and fate of other volatile chemicals in the upper reaches of EFPC...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of cleaning up}} contaminated ground water and aquifer solids from so-called "town gas" sites using photolytic ozonation and chemical in situ aquifer reclamation (CISR) techniques was investigated in the laboratory. At the actual site, coal was thermally oxidized to produce methane for municipal distribution. The degradation left a coal tar which, if released into the ground,could contaminate ground water and aquifer solids {{with a number of}} organic substances, including aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzene, toluene, xylene (BTX), and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at environmentally significant concentrations. Photolytic ozonation was used to destroy BTX and PAHs in ground-water samples taken from the Taylorville "town gas" site, using a stirred- tank reactor in the laboratory. Ozonation was found to be as effective as ozone/UV for this treatment. This is often seen in natural waters, and it is thought to be due to the presence of natural "promoters" for the free-radical reactions that are largely responsible for the destruction of organic compounds during treatment. Estimated treatment costs were $ 4. 05 per thousand gallons (Kgal) for destruction of BTX and PAHs by ozonation, and $ 2. 57 per Kgal if the BTX was <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> air <b>stripping</b> prior to ozone treatment. A chemical in situ treatment method using persulfate as a source of free radicals destroyed organic contaminants that were adsorbed to the aquifer solids. PAHs were reduced by 34 percent after 12 days of treatment and by 52 percent after 40 days. Preliminary evidence suggests that mobilization of contaminants by?? oxidation of the natural and/or adsorbed organic matter associated with the solids may be important.

40|$|Abstract: The MODerate {{resolution}} Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) is {{consisted of}} cross-track scan mirror and linear arrays of ten detectors. Because 1) the abnormal {{behavior of the}} response of each detector, 2) optical cross–talk and shortwave infrared thermal leak, and 3) reflectance, emissivity, or polarization of each scan mirror side are the cause of artificial strips appearing in the images. The histogram modification algorithm by Weinreb 1989 {{seemed to be the}} most promising way in correcting the strip noise. It is based on an assumption that each sensor view a statistically similar sub scenes. However, undesirable side-effect of Weinreb’s algorithm arise from the certain cases which are statistical differences sensitivity in the image data recorded by the individual detectors, and detector saturation generates stripe. In this paper, the modification of Weinreb’s algorithm was developed and implemented by acquiring image statistics from homogeneous subimages and <b>removing</b> saturated <b>strip</b> <b>by</b> a method based on local gray tone statistics from the facet model...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedIt Is {{essential that the}} force vector {{of the weight of}} a coring tool act along a line that is parallel to the longitudinal axis of the core barrel. Such an alignment enables corers to obtain deeper, less disturbed core samples. The probability of bending the core barrel is furthermore greatly reduced. A fin assembly that provides the maximum righting moment for one shape of coring tool does not necessarily provide the maximum moment for a different shape. The optimum fin design is determined by testing. A fin assembly for a particular coring tool has been devised which reduces the probability of the force vector not acting parallel to the longitudinal axis. The optimum design is a vane-shroud fin assembly. The shape of the shroud is conical. Slotting the shroud <b>by</b> <b>removing</b> longitudinal <b>strips</b> improves the righting capability at higher angles of deviation, but is slightly inferior to the full shroud at lesser angles.

40|$|Current {{methods for}} {{measuring}} dermal exposure to skin irritants and allergens, such as acrylates, have significant drawbacks for exposure assessment. A noninvasive sampling method {{has been developed}} and tested for measuring dermal exposure to a multifunctional acrylate employing a tape stripping of the nonviable epidermis (stratum corneum). Samples were subsequently extracted and a gas chromatographic method was employed for quantitat-ive analysis of tripropylene glycol diacrylate (TPGDA). This method was tested in 10 human volunteers exposed to an a priori determined amount of TPGDA or a UV-radiation curable acrylate coating containing TPGDA (UV-resin) at different sites on hands and arms. On the average, the first tape stripping removed 94 % (coefficient of variation 16 %) of the theoretical quantity of deposited TPGDA and 89 % (coefficient of variation 15 %) of the theoretical quan-tity of deposited TPGDA in UV-resin 30 min after exposure. Quantities of TPGDA recovered from two consecutive tape strippings accounted {{for all of the}} test agent, demonstrating both the efficiency of the method to measure dermal exposure and the potential to determine the rate of absorption with successive samples over time. In general, the amount <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> the first <b>stripping</b> was greater for TPGDA than for UV-resin while the second stripping remove...|$|R
40|$|This project {{investigates the}} in-situ {{degradation}} of semi{{volatile organic compounds}} (SVOCs) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) using in-well sonication, in-well vapor stripping, and bioremediation. Pretreating groundwaters with sonication techniques in-situ would form VOCs that can be effectively <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> in-well vapor <b>stripping</b> and bioremediation. The mechanistic studies focus on the coupling of megasonics and ultrasonics to soften (i. e., partially degrade) the SVOCs; oxidative reaction mechanism studies; surface corrosion studies (on the reactor walls/well); enhancement due to addition of oxidants, quantification of the hydroxyl radical formation; identification/quantification of degradation products; volatility/degradability of the treated waters; development of a computer simulation model to describe combined in-well sonication/in-well vapor stripping/bioremediation; systems analysis/economic analysis; large laboratory-scale experiment verification; and field demonstration of the integrated technology. Benefits of this approach include: (1) Remediation is performed in-situ; (2) The treatment systems complement each other; their combination can drastically reduce or remove SVOCs and VOCs; (3) Ability to convert hard-to-degrade organics into more volatile organic compounds; (4) Ability to remove residual VOCs and softened SVOCs through the combined action of in-well vapor stripping and biodegradation; (5) Does not require handling or disposing of water at the ground surface; and (6) Cost-effective and improved efficiency, resulting in shortened clean-up times to remediate a site. ...|$|R
40|$|Volatile organic {{compounds}} {{are a common}} source of groundwater contamination {{that can be easily}} <b>removed</b> <b>by</b> air <b>stripping</b> in columns with random packing and using a counter-current flow between the phases. This work proposes a new methodology for column design for any type of packing and contaminant which avoids the necessity of an arbitrary chosen diameter. It also avoids the employment of the usual graphical Eckert correlations for pressure drop. The hydraulic features are previously chosen as a project criterion. The design procedure was translated into a convenient algorithm in C++ language. A column was built in order to test the design, the theoretical steady-state and dynamic behaviour. The experiments were conducted using a solution of chloroform in distilled water. The results allowed for a correction in the theoretical global mass transfer coefficient previously estimated by the Onda correlations, which depend on several parameters that are not easy to control in experiments. For best describe the column behaviour in stationary and dynamic conditions, an original mathematical model was developed. It consists in a system of two partial non linear differential equations (distributed parameters). Nevertheless, when flows are steady, the system became linear, although there is not an evident solution in analytical terms. In steady state the resulting ODE can be solved by analytical methods, and in dynamic state the discretization of the PDE by finite differences allows for the overcoming of this difficulty. To estimate the contaminant concentrations in both phases in the column, a numerical algorithm was used. The high number of resulting algebraic equations and the impossibility of generating a recursive procedure did not allow the construction of a generalized programme. But an iterative procedure developed in an electronic worksheet allowed for the simulation. The solution is stable only for similar discretizations values. If different values for time/space discretization parameters are used, the solution easily becomes unstable. The system dynamic behaviour was simulated for the common liquid phase perturbations: step, impulse, rectangular pulse and sinusoidal. The final results do not configure strange or non-predictable behaviours...|$|R
