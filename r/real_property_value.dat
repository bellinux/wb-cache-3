It is one of 18 individual fire districts that protect the unincorporated area surrounding the city of Louisville, Kentucky. Highview is primarily residential with a light commercial and industrial base. It is a combination career/volunteer department that operates from 3 stations. The district has an ISO Class 3 rating and maintains a modern fleet of 17 vehicles. The department consists of a suppression force of 13 full-time and 41 volunteer firefighters. The career personnel work in three platoons and are available 24 hours a day. Volunteers are available at all hours. [...] In addition to fire and rescue functions, Highview personnel are trained in hazardous materials, operations and technician levels, and lends members to the Jefferson County Trench, Louisville Metro Urban Search and Rescue Team, and Swift Water Rescue Teams. As many of the firefighters are also nationally registered Emergency Medical Technicians, the department provides Basic Life Support assistance to Louisville Metro EMS on an as needed basis. The Highview Fire District is governed by a seven-member Board of Trustees. Three of these positions are appointed by the Mayor, two are elected property owners, and two are firefighter representatives. The operations budget is funded by a tax base. The current tax rate is 10 cents per $100 of assessed <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

The systematic information provided by Cadastre about wealth of land to each of the administrative jurisdictions includes quantitative and qualitative aspects as a basis for the decision-making process, mainly for the public service on development planning and on tax-system.

40|$|Today, {{nobody has}} {{doubts about the}} need for real {{property}} taxation. The main issue in the analysis of the real property taxation is related to the correctness of taxation. In this case the correctness of taxation is understood as the right and grounded estimation of taxable value.

In the course of property valuation for taxation in most cases the single valuation is not applied since it is too time and work consuming, and in some way expressing a subjective opinion of a valuer; difficult to apply for valuation of many property objects, also the costs are too high.

40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this degree {{paper is to}} analyze the fiscal impact of nonresidential {{development}} on annexed territory in the City of East Point, Georgia. The analysis projects the direct, current, public costs and revenues associated with nonresidential development on one hundred fifty (150) acres of annexed land. The analysis considers the current costs and revenues of the development {{as if it were}} completed and operating today. The Proportional Valuation Method (PVM), developed by Robert W. Burchell and David Listokin (1980) was used to conduct the analysis. PVM is an average costing approach used to project the impact of nonresidential development on local costs and revenues. The method assigns costs attributable to the share of the <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>value</b> that nonresidential use adds to a city 2 ̆ 7 s real property tax base. The method employs a two step process to assign a share of municipal costs to the new development. First, a share of the city 2 ̆ 7 s total operating expenditures is given to all local nonresidential uses. Second, a portion of these nonresidential costs is allocated to the incoming nonresidential facility. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the costs and revenues associated with the development of an office industrial park complex on 150 acres of nonresidential land acquired by the City of East Point, Georgia. This study is significant because of the fact that the analysis provides useful information which the officials of the City of East Point can use to determine whether the annexation will impact positively on the revenue base of the city.

Također, u radu se razmatraju i efekti uvođenja i primjene ovog poreznog oblika u Hrvatskoj. Provedena analiza ukazuje na značajne razlike u prihodnom potencijalu ovog poreznog oblika između novih zemalja članica (EU- 10) i zemalja koje su postale članicama prije 2004. godine (EU- 17). Prihodi od periodičkog poreza na nekretnine čine u prosjeku 0, 5 posto BDP-a (1, 7 posto ukupnih poreznih prihoda) EU- 10, dok na razini EU- 17 oni čine 1, 0 posto BDP-a (2, 5 posto ukupnih poreznih prihoda). Na temelju usporednog pregleda predmeta oporezivanja, načina utvrđivanja porezne osnovice, poreznih stopa te poreznih olakšica i izuzeća po zemljama članicama Europske Unije (uključujući i Hrvatsku), vidljivo je kako je u većini zemalja članica EU porez na nekretnine izvor proračuna lokalnih vlasti koje ujedno određuju i visinu poreza. U radu se zaključuje kako bi prilikom provođenja poreznih reformi koje uključuju i reforme poreza na nekretnine, valjalo voditi računa o specifi čnosti poreznog sustava pojedine zemlje. The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{consider}} the main features of immovable property tax, the arguments for using real property taxation and to give a survey of recurrent property tax regimes across EU countries. Recent empirical studies have identifi ed taxes on real estate property as least detrimental to GDP growth. In line with these results the Council of Europe invites Member States to review their tax systems, shifting tax intensity from labour taxes towards taxes on consumption and property. However, when interpreting aforementioned results, we should take into account the fact that these fi ndings are based on a sample of OECD countries whose tax systems are traditionally based on the taxation of income, profi ts and property. In contrast, tax structure in Croatia is rather different. Croatian tax system is predominantly based on consumption taxation. The most abundant source of budget revenues is Value Added Tax – VAT which accounts for 60 % of total tax revenues of government budget revenues, followed by special taxes and excise (18. 3 % of total government budget revenues). The one part of the paper is dedicated to the analysis of importance of recurrent tax on real estate property across EU member states. The importance is measured by the share of the revenues of recurrent property taxes in the total governmental revenues and in the GDP. The results of the analysis indicate that there is a signifi cant gap between the new EU countries (EU- 10) and the old member states (EU- 17) in terms of recurrent taxes on property in GDP and in total tax revenues. In 2011 the average for EU- 10 countries was around 0. 5 % in GDP (1. 7 % total tax revenues) vs 2. 0 % GDP average for EU- 17 countries (2. 5 % of the total tax revenues). In addition, this paper examines the application of recurrent property tax in the EU Countries. The research leads to the conclusion that in most of the EU member states the recurrent property tax is a local tax and it is typically levied at the sub-central level. On the other hand, objects taxable with recurrent property tax, tax rates, procedure for setting tax rates, tax reliefs and exemptions signifi cantly differ in the EU member states.
