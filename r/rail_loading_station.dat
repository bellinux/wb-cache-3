40|$|In this paper, {{computer}} simulation {{is used to}} evaluate the effects of various control rules on the performance of a flexible manufacturing system (FMS) operating under different manufacturing environment. Alternative routings are available, if the operation of a part can be performed by more than one machine. Three control rules, namely, dynamic alternative routings, planned alternative routings, and no alternative routings, are proposed to control the selection of alternative routings for each part. The effects of the universal <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> and also those of the dedicated <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> are investigated. In addition, the impact of buffer existence on the system's performance is also examined by considering machines with and without local buffers. The effects of changing production ratios of different part types on the performance of various operational control rules are also investigated. Moreover, the effects of system having machine breakdown are also discussed. The simulation results indicate that the FMS with dedicated <b>loading</b> <b>stations</b> outperforms the FMS with universal <b>loading</b> <b>stations</b> in all aspects. The dynamic alternative routings generally produces the best results in system performance if the universal <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> is provided. The planned alternative routings generally gives the best system performance when both the dedicated <b>loading</b> <b>stations</b> and local buffers are available. The no alternative routings usually remains {{at the bottom of the}} rank, occasionally with some exceptions. Problems in actual implementation are also highlighted. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
50|$|Wildebeest {{features}} two stations: a <b>station</b> for <b>loading</b> and a <b>station</b> for unloading. To {{enter the}} station, guests {{walk through the}} ride entrance and up the ramp. Guests then navigate a multitude of queue switchbacks. After passing through the switchbacks, guests approach the <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b> The <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> is split in half by the conveyor belt that eventually takes the boats up the lift hill. On {{the side of the}} station closest to the queues there is a grouping area, where riders from the main line and single riders line merge to ensure every seat is filled. The side of the <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> opposite the queues is the location of the ride operator's controls. At the end of the ride, boats enter the unloading station, at which point riders unload. The empty boats then pass over a series of rollers arranged in a curve that carry the boat back to the <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} set up a queuing theory model and propose an {{improved}} method of capacity calculation, the existing equipment of <b>loading</b> <b>station,</b> railway line situation and technological processes were analyzed, then each operation time was determined in this paper. And queuing system of Nanping Station was taken for example. Based on the system structure and operations of the <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> analysis, a survey of the event flows of the arrivals and services in subsystems to derive the queue parameters of queuing subsystem was made. At last, the system capacity of the <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> was calculated out...|$|R

40|$|A {{computer}} model was developed using COREsim {{to perform a}} time motion study for the Low Enriched Uranium (LEU) <b>Loading</b> <b>Station</b> operations. The project is to blend Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) with Natural Uranium (NU) to produce LEU to be shipped to Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) for further processing. To cope with a project cost reduction, the LEU <b>Loading</b> <b>Station</b> concept has changed from an enclosed building with air-conditioning to a partially enclosed building without air conditioning. The LEU <b>Loading</b> <b>Station</b> is within a radiological contaminated area; two pairs of coveralls and negative pressure respirator are required. As a result, inclement weather conditions, especially heat stress, will affect and impact the LEU loading operations. The purposes of the study are to determine the climatological impacts on LEU Loading operations, resources required for committed throughputs, {{and to find out}} the optimum process pathways for multi crews working simultaneously in the space-lim ited LEU <b>Loading</b> <b>Station...</b>|$|R

50|$|Six Flags Astroworld and Intamin AG partnered in 1979 {{to build}} the world's first river rapids ride in 1980 called Thunder River. The water ride became so popular at Astroworld that Six Flags debuted two new river rapids in 1981 at Six Flags Magic Mountain and at Six Flags Great Adventure, 1983 at Six Flags Over Texas, and 1984 at Six Flags Great America. The version at Six Flags Over Texas {{features}} a dual <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> where boats can be loaded at {{twice the rate of}} one <b>loading</b> <b>station.</b> The Magic Mountain version doesn't feature a dual <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> but is built to feature one. The Great America version also doesn't feature a dual <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> but features a turning station where the station moves in a circle with the boat where riders can depart and get on. The Six Flags Over Texas and Six Flags Magic Mountain rides operate from spring to the end of Fright Fest in October. The Six Flags Great America ride operates from spring to around Labor Day. At some parks, the ride is transformed into a Fright Fest maze during October. At Six Flags Over Texas the rise is closed during both Fright Fest and Holiday in the park.|$|R

40|$|In {{the context}} of future {{e-mobility}} concepts one important research question is the location for public <b>loading</b> <b>stations.</b> Nowadays a study for Berlin has analyzed a location distribution for a e-mobility structure based on existing electricity infrastructure. In contrast to that this paper will analyze the end customer perspective regarding possible <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> spots in e-mobility concepts {{in the city of}} Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia. The paper at hand describes and compares two different methods of research. On the one hand a consumer survey {{and on the other hand}} an analysis of existing data of liable parking areas in Duisburg. Based on this analyzed data a classification of the consumer's behavior will be enabled. This classification can be grouped in 3 categories: short-term, mid-term and long-term parking. These three categories can determinate which locations and which kind of <b>loading</b> <b>station</b> are requested by the today's consumers parking behavior and by the survey results of the interviewed consumers...|$|R
