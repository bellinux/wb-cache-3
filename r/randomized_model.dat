Under periodic boundaries, instead of updating all cars of the same colour at once during each step, the <b>randomized</b> <b>model</b> performs [...] updates (where [...] is the side length of the presumably square lattice): each time, a random cell is selected and, if it contains a car, it is moved to the next cell if possible. In this case, the intermediate state observed in the usual BML traffic model does not exist, due to the non-deterministic nature of the randomized model; instead {{the transition from the}} jammed phase to the free flowing phase is sharp.|$|E

40|$|The minmax regret {{problem for}} {{combinatorial}} optimization under uncertainty {{can be viewed}} as a zero-sum game played between an optimizing player and an adversary, where the optimizing player selects a solution and the adversary selects costs with the intention of maximizing the regret of the player. The conventional minmax regret model considers only deterministic solutions/strategies, and minmax regret versions of most polynomial solvable problems are NP-hard. In this paper, we consider a <b>randomized</b> <b>model</b> where the optimizing player selects a probability distribution (corresponding to a mixed strategy) over solutions and the adversary selects costs with knowledge of the player’s distribution, but not its realization. We show that under this <b>randomized</b> <b>model,</b> the minmax regret version of any polynomial solvable combinatorial problem becomes polynomial solvable. This holds true for both interval and discrete scenario representations of uncertainty. Using the <b>randomized</b> <b>model,</b> we show new proofs of existing approximation algorithms for the deterministic model based on primal-dual approaches. We also determine integrality gaps of minmax regret formulations, giving tight bounds on the limits of performance gains from randomization. Finally, we prove that minmax regret problems are NP-hard under general convex uncertainty. United States.
