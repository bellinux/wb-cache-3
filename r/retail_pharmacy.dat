5|$|Simpson {{opened his}} own chemist shop in Brunswick West in 1918. On 12 August 1919 he married Jean Elizabeth Watson at the Congregational Church in Ascot Vale, Victoria. Their {{marriage}} produced two children, {{a son who}} died in infancy and a daughter, Jean Marjorie. One of the witnesses at their wedding ceremony was a fellow Militia officer, Alan Ramsay, who later married Jean's sister Edna. In 1937, Simpson banded together with D. E. Robertson and A. E. Moore to create the Allied Master Chemists of Australia Ltd, today better known as Amcal. They invited other pharmacists to join them to compete against the growing market power of major retailers. The business grew from 12 members in 1937 to over 100 by 1946. Today Amcal is the largest <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacy</b> chain in Australia.|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{overall volume}} of {{antibiotic}} {{consumption in the}} community {{is one of the}} foremost causes of antimicrobial resistance. There is much ad-hoc information about the inappropriate consumption of antibiotics, over-the-counter availability, and inadequate dosage but there is very little actual evidence of community practices. Methods: This study surveyed antibiotic use in the community (December 2007 -November 2008) using the established methodology of patient exit interviews at three types of facilities: 20 private <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> 10 public sector facilities, and 20 private clinics to obtain a complete picture of community antibiotic use over a year. The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification and the Defined Daily Dose (DDD) measurement units were assigned to the data. Antibiotic use was measured as DDD/ 1000 patients visiting the facility and also as percent of patients receiving an antibiotic. Results: During the data collection period, 17995, 9205, and 5922 patients visiting private <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> public facilities and private clinics, respectively, were included in our study. 39 % of the patients attending private <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> and public facilities and 43 % of patients visiting private clinics were prescribed at least one antibiotic.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{determinants of}} ex-manufacturer prices for originator and generic drugs across a large sample of countries. We focus on drugs to treat HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria in middle and low income countries (MLICs), with robustness checks to other therapeutic categories and other countries. We examine effects of per capita income, income dispersion, number {{and type of}} therapeutic and generic competitors, and whether the drugs are sold to <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> vs. tendered procurement by NGOs. The cross-national income elasticity of prices is 0. 4 across high and low income countries, but is only 0. 15 between MLICs, implying that drugs are least affordable relative to income in the lowest income countries. Within-country income inequality contributes to relatively high prices in MLICs. Number of therapeutic and generic competitors only weakly affects prices to <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> plausibly because uncertain quality leads to competition on brand rather than price. Tendered procurement attracts multi-national generic suppliers and significantly reduces prices for originators and generics, compared to prices to <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Pharmacy Practice), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Pharmaceutical {{care can}} be defined as “the care that a given patient {{requires}} and receives which assures safe and rational drug usage” (Mikael et al., 1975 : 567). The supply of medication is an important link in the health care chain, and the supply of chronic medication specifically was reviewed in this study. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2008 d) states that chronic disease and related deaths are increasing in low- and middle-income countries, causing 39 % and 72 % of all deaths in low- and middle-income countries respectively. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the difference between chronic medication prescribing patterns and subsequent claiming patterns for community (retail) and mail order (courier) pharmacies in the South African private health care sector. Computerized claims data for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010 were extracted from the database of a South African pharmaceutical benefit management company. The chronic database consisted of 6 191 147 prescriptions (N = 17 706 524), 14 045 546 items (N = 42 176 768) at a total cost of R 2 126 516 154. 00 (N = R 4 969 436 580. 88). A quantitative, retrospective, cross-sectional drug utilisation review was conducted, and data were analysed using the Statistical Analysis System® programme. Various providers of chronic medication were analysed, namely dispensing doctors, dispensing specialists, courier <b>pharmacies</b> and <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Chronic medication represented 34. 97 % of all medication prescribed. <b>Retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> dispensed 79 % of this chronic medication (n = 2 441 613 items) and courier pharmacies 19 % (n = 610 964 items). Courier pharmacies dispensed 1 147 687 prescriptions containing chronic medication and <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> dispensed 4 900 282. The average cost per prescription for chronic medication at <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> was R 325. 43 ± R 425. 74 (2009) and R 335. 10 ± R 449. 84 (2010), and that of courier pharmacies was R 398. 56 ± R 937. 61 in 2009 and R 436. 57 ± R 1199. 46 in 2010. The top-five chronic medication groups dispensed by both these pharmacy types were selected according to the number of unique patients utilising these medications for at least four consecutive months. The most utilised chronic medication groups were ACE inhibitors (n = 1 611 432), statins (n = 1 449 732), diuretics (n = 962 670), thyroid medication (n = 885 891) and oral antidiabetics (n = 696 631). The average medication possession ratio for <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> indicated that, on average, statins, diuretics, thyroid medication and oral antidiabetics were undersupplied by <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Courier pharmacies tended to oversupply more often than <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> with the cost of oversupplied medication ranging from 9 % to 11 % of total courier pharmacy medication costs. The average chronic prescription, item and levy cost did not vary significantly between courier and <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> This indicates that the relative cost of acquiring chronic medication is similar at <b>retail</b> and courier <b>pharmacy.</b> The medication possession ratios of the top-five chronic medication groups, however, did differ significantly. In order to choose the most appropriate provider, the medical scheme provider needs to consider the over- and undersupply of medication. Oversupply may lead to unnecessary costs whilst undersupply may lead to future noncompliance and associated health problems. The costs associated with undersupply of medication in the South African health care sector need further investigation. Doctora...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the functional strategies of <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in South Africa with a view to identify and evaluate variables which universally and significantly influence their profitability. The study devoted attention to both external, uncontrollable variables and internal, controllable variables. The functional strategies were assessed by means of management audit criteria. A sample of 800 <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> was selected from the 2 755 <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in South Africa at the time of the study. A response rate of 32 % was achieved. Multiple regression analysis was used in this study and the influences identified may be summarised as follows: Positive influences: General management : Written mission statement; Strength and weaknesses analysed. Marketing management: Location in a medical centre; Trading hours; Number of prescriptions dispensed. Personnel: Number of management courses attended. Purchasing: Purchase ratio. Financial management: Single proprietorship; Partnership. Negative influences: General management : Lack of a written mission statement. Marketing management: Location in a shopping centre; Location on the street front; Pricing by means of percentage mark-up (Pricing may be regarded as a variable related to both marketing and financial management.) Personnel: -. Purchasing: -. Financial management: Discounts afforded to medical schemes; Close corporation In order to enhance and improve their profitability, retail pharmacists should capitalise on those variables which influence profitability positively and modify those variables which were found to influence profitability negatively.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to address an {{important}} gap in the literature by investigating the relationship between organizational climate and performance in small businesses. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 100 <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies</b> in Sydney, Australia where a manager and up to three staff members and three buying customers were interviewed in each pharmacy. Findings – Supportive climates tend to be associated with higher organizational performance (i. e. financial performance, staff satisfaction, customer satisfaction) in small <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies,</b> and may reduce staff turnover. Practical implications – The results suggest that managers should consider creating warm and supportive organizational climates to enhance business performance, employee job satisfaction and organizational commitment, and increase employee tenure. Originality/value – This paper is among the first to empirically establish a direct link between organizational climate and the performance of small businesses, in particular in <b>retail</b> <b>pharmacies.</b> Both financial and non-financial measures of performance confirm reports based on larger firms that performance is enhanced in the presence of more supportive organizational climates.
