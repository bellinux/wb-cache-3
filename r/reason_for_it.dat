Gopal and Latha find that they like each other, so Gopal invites them to stay at his palatial mansion in Ooty, which they accept. One day, Latha discovers that Gopal becomes agitated whenever he sees an onrushing train and demands the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Gopal explains that the reason behind this is his first wife.|$|E
5|$|While {{going to}} meet Doggett and Scully, Wells gets shoved into a dominos game and while picking them up gets slashed on his right cheek from a man with the spider web tattoo on his hand. Wells tells Doggett and Scully that he is moving {{backwards}} in time and cannot recall the past few days. Doggett is skeptical, but Scully hears him out. Wells says {{there must be a}} <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> and Scully suggests that the answer may already be within him. Studying the evidence of the case, Wells has a flash of the murder that reveals the knife in a hand with a spider web tattoo.|$|E

Trueman had made friends with Frank Worrell and other West Indian players when he met them in English league cricket and objected strongly to Hutton's policy, claiming that he was not alone in this and especially as Hutton gave no <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> Trueman suspected the MCC hierarchy of instructing Hutton to make the demand. For his own part, he would not allow anyone to dictate to him with whom he should be friends.|$|E
25|$|Various Puranas narrate {{the greatness}} of bathing in the Yamuna. The Padma Purana narrates {{the story of two}} brothers, who lived a life of indulgence and lust and gave up the virtuous ways. They finally plunged in poverty and resorted to robbery and were killed by beasts in the forest. Both of them reached Yama's court for judgement. While the elder brother was sentenced to Naraka (hell), the younger was granted Svarga (heaven). Astonished, the younger brother asked the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it,</b> as both lived similar lives. Yama {{explained}} that the younger brother had lived in the ashram of a sage on Yamuna's banks and bathed in the sacred river for two months. The first month absolved him of sins and the second one granted him place in heaven.|$|E
25|$|Before 1199, {{there were}} {{settlements}} nearby from ancient times. A Neolithic and a late Bronze Age settlement {{have been found}} in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the Romans. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of Caesaromagus (the market place of Caesar), although the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear – possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace Londinium or Camulodunum. The remains of a mansio, a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern Moulsham, and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.|$|E

500|$|Amongst S-type asteroids, Juno {{is unusually}} reflective, {{which may be}} {{indicative}} of distinct surface properties. This high albedo explains its relatively high apparent magnitude for a small object not near the inner edge of the asteroid belt.

To protect Quinn {{and ensure}} Jacob will not release the story, Rachel agrees {{to give him}} her underwear.

Overall, the authorities had little trouble suppressing the events, as none of the relatively few witnesses have shown any particular desire to make the event more widely known. There was some gossip about the incident, with most people considering it a suicide rather than an accident, but the <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was unclear, and no one connected Siwiec's dramatic actions to contemporary political events. As publicist Stefan Kisielewski wrote in his diary two days after Siwiec's death, [...] "There are rumours about a self-immolation [...] but none knows the reason for it." ...|$|E
500|$|Make-up effects artist Toby Lindala was {{tasked with}} {{creating}} a prop {{which would allow}} actress Sarah Koskoff to simulate a nosebleed on-camera, rather than {{through the use of}} off-screen make-up and editing tricks. However, during test shots, the prop's tubing burst, causing the stage blood to begin dripping down Koskoff's forehead, rather than from her nose. Gillian Anderson has expressed displeasure over the scene in which her character, Dana Scully, visits Fox Mulder in his motel room in her underwear to have him examine a suspicious wound which turns out to be insect bites. The actress felt that the scene was too gratuitous, saying [...] "there really wasn't a <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it.</b> The bites could have been on my shoulder or something." [...] However, Carter has explained that the scene was simply intended to highlight the platonic relationship between the two lead roles.|$|E

[...] However, Foraker gave other reasons for the break, stating after Hanna's death that one <b>reason</b> <b>for</b> <b>it</b> was that Hanna bought up the extra tickets of black Southern convention delegates, a practice that the governor considered corrupt. [...] J.B. Morrow, the newspaper publisher who took Foraker's statement as source material for Herbert Croly's 1912 biography of Hanna, disagreed: [...] "it was understood at the time that his [...] heart was not in Sherman's candidacy... his outraged feelings over Hanna's bargaining with Southern delegates can't be believed by me."

[...] He referred to a case under Scottish law – S. v. H.M.

[...] "Our model said take him with, like, the 15th pick in the draft." [...] A year after the Rockets failed to draft Lin, they began to measure the speed of a player’s first two steps; Lin had the quickest first move of any player measured, and he was able to change direction far more quickly than most NBA players.
