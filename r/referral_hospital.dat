Method: A cross-sectional descriptive {{study was conducted in}} all maternity units of Limpopo’s public <b>referral</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The study population comprised of 210 registered nurses, who became the study sample. Data on their educational profile and work experience in midwifery was analysed using STATA version 9. 0. Results: The mean age of the 210 registered nurses was 44. 5 ± 9. 1 years (range 21 to 62).

25|$|Only 5% {{of large}} {{intestinal}} impactions at <b>referral</b> <b>hospital</b> are involve the cecum. Primary cecal impactions usually consist of dry feed material, with the horse slowly developing clinical signs over several days. Secondary cecal impactions may occur post-surgery, orthopedic or otherwise, and the cecum does not function properly. Horses usually show clinical signs 3–5 days post general anesthesia, including decreased appetite, decreased manure production, and {{gas in the}} cecum which can be auscultated. The cecum quickly distends due to fluid and gas accumulation, often leading to rupture within 24–48 hours if not corrected. This impaction may be missed since decreased manure production can be attributed secondarily to surgery, and often rupture occurs before severe signs of pain. Horses are most at risk {{for this type of}} impaction if surgery is greater than 1 hour in length, or if inadequate analgesia is provided postoperatively.|$|E

Setting: The Overstrand sub-district in the Western Cape: 80 000 people served by 7 clinics and a district hospital in Hermanus, 120 km from its <b>referral</b> <b>hospitals</b> in Cape Town and Worcester. A colposcopy service was established at Hermanus Hospital in 2008. Subjects: All women in the Overstrand sub-district who required colposcopy on the basis of cervical smears done in 2007 and 2009. Outcome measures: The number of women booked for colposcopy at distant <b>referral</b> <b>hospitals</b> in 2007 and at the district hospital is 2009, the proportion of those women who attended colposcopy, the time from cervical smear to colposcopy, comparison between the two years. Results: The uptake of colposcopy booked for distant <b>referral</b> <b>hospitals</b> was 67 % in 2007. The uptake improved by 18 % to 79 % for the local district hospital colposcopy service in 2009 (p= 0. 06).
