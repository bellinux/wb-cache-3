Prolific aspen resprouting after fire {{is well documented}} (Bailey and Whitham 2002; Stoddard et al. 2015; Yocom-Kent et al. 2015). However, aspen sprouts in Southwestern forests commonly fail to reach tree stature if exposed to intensive herbivory, pathogens, or reburning (Fairweather et al. 2008; Zegler et al. 2012). In addition, aspen may reestablish on sites through top-kill and release of suppressed meristems, but changing climatic conditions and environmental stressors may reduce the range of persistence. In our study, aspen regeneration increased over 800 % in 2002, then fell below pre-fire densities in 2011. Fairweather et al. (2008) found a similar trend on the San Francisco Peaks, vis-Ã -vis an increase of aspen sprouts {{following the death of}} mature trees in 2002, and then nearly all aspen sprouts died by 2007.

30|$|Flowering, pollination, seed {{production}} and germination are sub-processes of the regeneration process {{of trees and}} stands. All these sub-processes {{are very sensitive to}} weather conditions such as temperature and rainfall. In addition, the eventual size of the seed crop depends on the fluctuations of seed predators and seed diseases. Since many sub-processes critical to regeneration success depend on weather conditions, it is impossible to predict the exact amount of regeneration in a certain year in the future, even when there are plenty of empirical <b>regeneration</b> <b>data</b> to fit models. The best that can be done is to predict the distribution of regeneration results or the probability of successful regeneration. Mortality is also hard to predict exactly. However, the so-called regular mortality (competition-related mortality) is very low in regularly thinned managed boreal forest. Therefore, if catastrophic events are excluded from the analysis (like in this study) uncertainty in mortality does not add much to the total degree of uncertainty in the prediction of stand development.

In general, ECG-triggering is used together with the rSE-DWI {{in order to prevent}} the loss of projection data, where the amount of loss depends on the data acquisition timing in the cardiac cycle. The ECG-triggering reduces the artifacts related to the cardiac pulse to some extent, but still leaves some degraded projection data while increasing the data acquisition time. Thus, the projection <b>data</b> <b>regeneration</b> method is pro-posed in order to improve the image quality. In the proposed method, the projection data is acquired by the rSE-DWI from which a temporary image is generated by an inverse Radon transform (IRT). The projection data acquired at each view angle is tested to figure out whether it is damaged by the pulsa-tile motion, and then the degraded data are replaced with the data that are regenerated by the Radon transform (RT) of the temporary image. The regeneration process is repeated until the image gains reasonable quality. In the meanwhile, the thermal noise of the signal is removed using the mask gener-ated by thresholding the intensity of the projection data. In order to demonstrate the efficiency, the proposed method for the improvement of image quality is applied to a phantom and in-vivo images. The quality of the DW images acquired by either ECG-triggered or non-triggered rSE-DWI can be im-proved using the proposed method without increasing the imaging time.

For the repeated measures analysis, we fit statistical models using compound symmetry, heterogonous compound symmetry, unstructured, spatial power, Toeplitz, and autoregressive covariance structures (Littell et al. 2006.)
