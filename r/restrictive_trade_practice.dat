50|$|The Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act, 1969 had its genesis in the Directive Principles of State Policy {{embodied}} in the Constitution of India. It received the assent of the President of India on 27 December, 1969. The Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act was intended to curb the rise of concentration of wealth in a few hands and of monopolistic practices. It was repealed on September 2009. The Act has been succeeded by The Competition Act, 2002.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> policy in India. This is of recent origin, and is broadly {{similar to that}} of the United Kingdom. The registration of agreements under this legislation has provided valuable insight into the extent of <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices.</b> It is suggested that the failure of the act lies rather in the administration than in the provisions of the act, and its future effectiveness will depend upon the degree to which detection and enforcement are pursued.

40|$|The 1965 {{legislation}} to curb <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> {{has been widely}} regarded as weak. By contrast, the <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1974 (Cth) has been considered as providing the platform for a more comprehensive competition policy. This paper argues that the 1965 – 67 and 1971 Acts were more effective than has been commonly recognised in raising awareness {{about the extent of}} <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices,</b> discrediting price agreements and laying the foundations for the 1974 Act. The role of Ron Bannerman, the sole Commissioner of <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices,</b> was critical to their success. This paper uses parliamentary debates, Bannerman's published works and an interview with him undertaken in early 2005. ...|$|R
50|$|The {{tribunal}} {{was first}} known under its former name, the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Commission. The Commission was empowered to investigate suspected offenses under the Combines Investigation Act, the {{precursor to the}} modern Competition Act.|$|R
40|$|Trade {{associations}} {{were common}} in Australia in the 1960 s {{with an estimated}} 1250 in existence (Freeman 1968 : 443 – 58). Their primary role, as perceived by economists {{of the day and}} the Attorney-General intent on introducing legislation to quell <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices,</b> was to create economic gain for the association’s members at the expense of their suppliers and/or customers. While Freeman (1968 : 457 – 58) argued that trade associations were neither necessary nor sufficient conditions for <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices,</b> such an interpretation was swept aside by Mancur Olson’s influential work on the rent-seeking ‘distributional coalition’ from the 1960 s to the 1980 s (Olson 1965, 1982) ...|$|R
50|$|By {{the early}} modern age, more policy choices had been developed. There was {{considerable}} debate about mercantilism and other <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> like the Navigation Acts, as trade policy became associated with both national wealth and with foreign and colonial policy.|$|R

50|$|The Civil Matters Branch is {{responsible}} for detecting and deterring <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> that {{have a negative impact}} on competition, such as abuse of dominance, refusal to deal, exclusive dealing, tied-selling and price maintenance. Activities of concern can also extend to certain types of anti-competitive agreements or arrangements of a non-criminal nature.|$|R
40|$|With the {{liberalisation}} and globalisation of the Indian economy, {{as could}} be expected, firms have been aggressively and vigorously promoting their products and services. These practices raise questions about truthfulness and fairness of representation of products and services. Not only the consumers but even the firms need adequate law against unfair <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> to have some ‘rules of the game’ for competing among themselves. In a competitive environment, every representation of a product or service, is about what ‘others are not’. This paper reviews the law in India on representations (advertisements) which have an element of comparison. The provisions on this aspect formed {{a part of the}} Unfair <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> under the Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act. In the changing context of proliferation of advertisements, the law needed to be further strengthened in its application. To the contrary, even the existing law has been liquidated with the repeal of the Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act. It has been suggested that the same protection against unfair <b>trade</b> <b>practices</b> have been available under the Consumer Protection Act. Thus, the repeal of the Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act would not be of any significance. However, within the structure of the Consumer Protection Act, competing firms cannot be ‘consumers’ to approach a consumer forum. The paper illustrates that the opening up of the economy, on its own, is not going to create and sustain competition. Appropriate law, adequate enforcement, infrastructure and quick dispute settlement mechanism would be needed to sustain competition. ...|$|R

50|$|In 1986, the Government of Canada {{introduced}} simultaneously the Competition Act and the Competition Tribunal Act. The Act dissolved the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Commission {{and created}} the Competition Tribunal and the Competition Bureau. Unlike the Commission, the Competition Tribunal has no authority to investigate offenses. Rather, it simply can make findings and issue remedial orders. The Competition Bureau carries out investigations.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{his return}} to India, Gharda briefly taught as a visiting faculty member at UDCT and then {{established}} Gharda Chemicals, which is today {{one of the largest}} agrochemical companies in India.

50|$|The Competition Act, 2002 {{was enacted}} by the Parliament of India and governs Indian {{competition}} law. It replaced the archaic The Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act, 1969. Under this legislation, the Competition Commission of India was established to prevent the activities that have an adverse effect on competition in India. This act extends to whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1956 {{was an act}} of the Parliament of the United Kingdom {{intended}} to enforce competition. It required that any agreement between companies that restricted trading should be placed on a public register unless granted exemption by the Secretary of State. Changes to an agreement, including its ending, were required to be notified and no agreement could be brought into force before appearing on the register.|$|R
50|$|The Independent Schools Council {{felt that}} the action was disproportionate. It was argued that sharing {{information}} was common amongst charities (as the schools are classified) and that {{the aim was to}} keep fees as low as practicably possible. Until 2000, when the Competition Act 1998 displaced the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1976, the practice was legal as the schools were exempt from the anti-cartel laws that apply to businesses.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mean}} time, Britain's own {{approach}} moved slowly, and saw no urgency {{for a similar}} competition law regime. The common law continued to serve its purpose, and debate about economic policy had become radically different after the First World War. A number of key industries had been nationalised, and the new Labour Party was committed to a socialist economic agenda: progressive democratic ownership {{of the means of}} production. In other words, the debate about economic policy was being had on a totally different level. Controlling private industry from arms length regulatory mechanisms was neither here nor there. After the second world war, this case was strengthened, yet Clement Attlee's Labour government did introduce the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act 1948. Far more limited than the Americanesque versions, this was updated in 1953. The <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1956 made it illegal for manufacturers to act in collusion to jointly maintain resale prices for their products to consumers. Later came the Monopolies and Mergers Act 1965 and the Monopolies And <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1969.|$|R

Attention is also given to whether the decisions have involved a proper utilisation of time. 10 page(s...|$|R
50|$|In 1955, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's report Collective Discrimination - A Report on Exclusive Dealing, Aggregated Rebates and Other Discriminatory <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> {{recommended}} that resale price maintenance, when collectively enforced by manufacturers {{should be made}} illegal, but individual manufacturers {{should be allowed to}} continue the practice. The report was the basis for the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act 1956, specifically prohibiting collective enforcement of resale price maintenance in the UK. Restrictive agreements had to be registered at the Restrictive Practices Court and were considered on individual merit.|$|R
25|$|The Monopolies and <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Commission (MRTPC) of India {{had asked}} its Director-General of Investigation {{to do an}} initial {{investigation}} into the BCCI's action against players who had joined the ICL. The investigation was based on media reports of the BCCI giving an open statement that it will ban players who join ICL. It was also reported in the media that all state associations, under direction from the BCCI, have cancelled contracts with players.|$|R
50|$|The <b>restrictive</b> <b>trade</b> <b>practices,</b> or antitrust, {{provisions}} in the CCA are aimed at deterring practices by firms which are anti-competitive in that they restrict free competition. This part of the act is enforced by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC). The ACCC can litigate in the Federal Court of Australia, and seek pecuniary penalties of up to $10 million from corporations and $500,000 from individuals. Private actions for compensation may also be available.|$|R
50|$|In 1948, the RHA {{published}} RHD20, a {{rate schedule}} for its members, which was followed up in 1960 by the Black Book - The Long Distance Rates Guide. This was a publication with around 140000 recommended rates for hauliers. The {{passing of the}} <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act of 1974, however, meant that the RHA could no longer make recommendations to members on how rates should be increased to match costs, and the Black Book was discontinued.|$|R

50|$|In {{competition}} law, exclusive dealing {{refers to}} an arrangement whereby a retailer or wholesaler is ‘tied’ to purchase from a supplier on the understanding that no other distributor will be appointed or receive supplies in a given area. When the sales outlets are owned by the supplier, exclusive dealing is because of vertical integration, where the outlets are independent exclusive dealing is illegal (in the US) due to the <b>Restrictive</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Practices</b> Act, however, if it is registered and approved it is allowed.|$|R
