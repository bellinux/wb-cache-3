Although Mechanical Concrete is over-designed, it operates much closer to the bearing stress range generated by the loads being supported so it is more economical. In addition, a Mechanical Concrete structure is manufactured at the construction site and <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> resist <b>loads</b> as soon as it is placed — no setting or curing time is required.

Laytime is the term used to quantify the time allowed within which an operation is allowed to be made. Demurrage is laytime consumed less laytime allocated (if any). The master of the ship must give a Notice of Readiness (NOR) to the charterer when the ship has arrived at the port of loading or discharge. The NOR informs the charterer that the ship is <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> or discharge. The date and time of the NOR determines when laytime is to commence.|$|E
50|$|When the Model 1900 was {{originally}} produced, it was chambered in an 8mm cartridge; however, in 1901, Mannlicher reintroduced {{it with the}} 7.63 Manlicher cartridge {{to make it more}} powerful. In order to distinguish this round from the 7.63 Mauser round, it was referred to in Germany as the 7.65 round, or the 7.63x21. This cartridge has a straight case and contains an 82 grain bullet that is propelled by 3.2 grains of smokeless powder. This equates to a muzzle velocity of about 1,000 feet per second, and 193-foot-pounds of muzzle energy. The cartridges are loaded into the pistol using a stripper clip, which holds ten rounds. The rims of the cartridges fit into the groove of the stripper clip and allow the cartridges to slide onto it and stay in place until they are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> into the breech. The end of the stripper clip is placed above the open breech, and then the cartridges can simply be pushed down so that they slide off the stripper clip and into the breech. The production of this cartridge mostly stopped in Europe {{with the end of the}} second world war, and continued to be produced in Argentina until 1958, but may still be in production today.|$|R

40|$|Background: Firearm {{ownership}} {{has often}} been used to measure access to weapons. However, per-sons who own a firearm may {{not have access to}} it and conversely, persons who do not own a firearm may be able to access one quickly. Objectives: To examine whether using firearm ownership is a reasonable proxy for access by describing the demographic characteristics associated with ownership and access. Methods: Data are from the 1994 Injury Control and Risk Survey, a national, random digit dial sur-vey. Information about household firearm ownership and <b>ready</b> access <b>to</b> a <b>loaded</b> firearm were col-lected and weighted to provide national estimates. Adjusted odds ratios for three separate models were calculated using logistic regression. Results: A total of 1353 (27. 9 %) respondents reported both having a firearm in the household and <b>ready</b> access <b>to</b> one. An additional 313 respondents (8. 1 %) reported having a firearm, but were not able to access these weapons. Another 421 respondents (7. 2 %) did not have a firearm in or around their home, yet reported being able to retrieve and fire one within 10 minutes.

50|$|The gun could fire a {{wide range}} of {{ammunition}} but the most commonly loaded types were high explosive squash head (HESH), armour-piercing discarding sabot (APDS), or practice round equivalents for both types. The Chieftain could store up to 64 projectiles (though a maximum of 36 APDS, limited by the propellant stowage). The gun was fully stabilised with a fully computerized integrated control system. The secondary armament consisted of a coaxial L8A1 7.62 mm machine gun and another 7.62 mm machine gun mounted on the commander's cupola. An advantage of using two-part ammunition was {{that in the case of}} inert rounds like APDS the loader could reach for the next round and hold it in his lap, <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> while the gunner was acquiring the target and firing.

30|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date is {{the earliest}} date upon which an aircraft can be loaded and depart the APOE. After selecting a pallet cargo load, DALP-TS computes an appropriate aircraft departure {{date from the}} APOE that considers pallet available to load date. The aircraft arrival date describes the date upon which the aircraft arrives at the APOD, incorporating the departure date and the required travel time from APOE to APOD. The aircraft departure date can {{be the same as}} the <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date; however, delaying the departure date to a later date may prevent or reduce the amount of pallet temporal violations. The <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date for each aircraft’s first trip is day 1. The <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date of each subsequent trip for a particular aircraft considers the previous trip’s departure date and the travel, down, and return time.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{changes to}} an {{aircraft}} trip’s temporal information {{results from the}} unload entire aircraft and inter-aircraft pallet swap neighborhoods. First, an aircraft trip departure date might require modification to minimize pallet temporal violations. If the current departure date of a trip is later than the <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date, DALP-TS can decrease the departure date; however, the algorithm does not schedule an aircraft trip’s departure date prior to its <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date. Decreasing a departure date only occurs if doing so improves the solution. Changing the departure date to a date which causes infeasibilities {{in the majority of}} the loaded pallets is unproductive. Decreasing the departure date of an aircraft trip creates a series of <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date decreases in subsequent aircraft trips; DALP-TS modifies the departure date of the succeeding aircraft trips if doing so improves the overall objective function value. Note that the trip <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date is the earliest date upon which an aircraft may depart; this date does not necessarily correspond to the best departure date for a given pallet load. By increasing a trip’s departure date, DALP-TS could trigger a series of updates to the subsequent aircraft trips. This occurs when a trip’s altered departure date causes the <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date of the succeeding trip to be after its departure date; DALP-TS then equates the departure date with the <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} the yard {{organisation}} on container stowing operations. We deal with the Master Bay Plan problem (MBPP), that consists in stowing containers of different types into available locations on a containership; the aim is to minimise the berthing time {{in such a way that}} structural and operational constraints, related to both the containers and the ship, are satisfied. In particular, we study how the total stowage time changes due to possible reloading operations, when different picking sequences are considered. We use a binary linear programming model for MBPP that has been recently proposed in literature considering two main scenarios. First, we assume to have all containers <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> on board in the quay independently of their stack position in the yard. In this case, we solve MBPP as it is having as objective function just the minimisation of the loading time. Then, we take into account the yard constraints following the directions of the planning office, which makes the bay plans according to the stocking area requirements and the picking list for the containers <b>to</b> be <b>loaded.</b> In the third case, we present a procedure that enables us to consider different lot arrivals and opportunely relax some constraints. Moreover, we assume that the containers are stored in the yard into different stacks on the basis of their size, destination and weight, depending on the storage strategy chosen by the yard managers. We evaluate alternative yard storage strategies with real size stowage plans of a containership located at a maritime terminal in Genoa. The results show that, when we look for the berthing time minimisation, it is quite important to think about the optimisation of the flow of containers from the yard to the quay.

30|$|Resonance {{frequency}} analysis {{has been used}} to document changes in the bone healing along the implant-bone interface by measuring the stiffness of implant in the bone tissue [31 – 34]. It has also been used to determine whether implants are ready for the final restoration [35] or <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> [33] and <b>to</b> identify the implants at “risk” [36]. The first studies using RFA were published in 1996 [37]. In 1997, Meredith et al. suggested a non-invasive method for determining the resonance frequency associated with dental implants by connecting an adapter/transducer onto the abutment in an animal study [38]. The experimented RFA system, base on magnetic pulses, has been commercially produced as Osstell since the year 2000 [19] (Osstell AB, Göteborg, Sweden). Osstell was later followed by Osstell Mentor™ and Osstell ISQ™. It calculates the Implant Stability Quotient (ISQ) converting kilohertz units to ISQ on a scale of 1 – 100, where 100 signifies the highest implant stability. Increases in ISQ measurements indicate improved bone stiffness and healing around the implant and better implant stability. The Osstell ISQ works by introducing a controlled vibration to the implant by means of a sensor and a rod (SmartPeg) connected to the implant and measuring its frequency. These SmartPegs are usually fabricated for standard diameter implants. The osseointegration potential of single-piece mini dental implants (3 M™ESPE™ MDIs) has never been assessed by RFA. The immediate post-surgical ISQ assessment of MDIs is particularly relevant due to their smaller size and surface area in comparison to standard implants.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{developed}} STEP-CNC Mapping System, with an aim {{to solve}} the problem faced by the current CNC systems, which is the disconnection between CAD and CAM developments for the manufacturing industry activities. This research is based on the concept that a STEP-NC program is machine-independent and has an advantage over the conventional G-code based NC program that is always generated for a specific CNC machine. The central part of the STEP-CNC Mapping System is the mapping mechanism which accepts STEP AP and translates it into the type of G-code that a specific controller can understand. The STEP-CNC Mapping System has two principal elements, a STEP Converter and a STEP-NC Translator. The STEP Converter takes a generic STEP AP 214 program as its input and produces a native STEP-NC file with a more specific version of the STEP-NC program, by "adapting" it to a local manufacturing environment and capabilities. This native STEP-NC file is a more structured populated version of the generic STEP AP file. It may be re-adapted to another manufacturing environment. The STEP-NC Translator takes a native STEP-NC file and converts it to the required machine control data, for example G-codes, that are <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> <b>to</b> the targeted CNC controller. The conversion process is also called a mapping or translating process that utilizes the manufacturing environment databases developed for specific machine tools, or rather CNC controllers. The system uses Visual Basic as its development tools and Microsoft Access and text file as its primary database. This system realizes the future of a common interface for CNC machine tools. With this developed STEP-CNC Mapping System in place, a generic STEP AP 214 program can be made to drive different CNC machine tools and a STEP-NC data file based on IS 0 14649 Part 11 is being generated and machined...|$|R

30|$|After {{selecting}} the aircraft, DALP-TS removes the pallet from the “storage aircraft” and assigns {{it to the}} first available position in the aircraft. If the aircraft’s trip is in state 1, no changes to the aircraft departure date or solution object are necessary; however, updates are required for states 2 or 3. First, DALP-TS increments the number of flights flown in the solution object. DALP-TS also updates the aircraft’s departure date and arrival date to reflect the new temporal constraints. DALP-TS sets the aircraft arrival date identical to the pallet latest arrival date and adjusts the aircraft’s departure date to incorporate travel time; this also causes the insertion of an additional aircraft trip in the solution object. The <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date of this trip incorporates the previous trip’s departure date and total travel time. For this trip, the aircraft is empty but available for future loading. If the initial solution generator is in state 3, the aircraft is being used for the first time; the aircraft departure date is updated such that the aircraft arrival date corresponds with the pallet’s earliest arrival date.|$|E
30|$|To {{generate}} an initial solution, DALP-TS sequentially sorts the pallets by increasing available load date, earliest arrival date, latest arrival date, and required delivery date, {{and then by}} decreasing weight, at this point, all pallets are theoretically “loaded” in the “storage aircraft.” The DALP-TS initial solution generator selects the pallet {{at the head of}} the sorted pallet list. Next, the best suitable aircraft is selected. Three states of feasible (i.e., no temporal or ACL violations) aircraft trip availability exist for every pallet: (1) At least one non-empty aircraft (i.e., with one or more pallets loaded) is scheduled to be at the APOE with feasible temporal constraints and sufficient weight and space capacity remaining to support the pallet. In this case, DALP-TS selects the aircraft with the largest ratio of ACL to number of pallet positions and the smallest weight capacity remaining. (2) An available aircraft has returned from a trip and has a <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> <b>load</b> date which enables the pallet to arrive on or before its latest arrival date. In state 2, DALP-TS the aircraft with the largest ratio of ACL to number of pallet positions and the largest trip index. (3) No additional aircraft trips satisfy the pallet’s temporal window requirements. For state 3, DALP-TS utilizes the next unused aircraft from the user-provided list of available aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Around {{this time}} the Nor’Westers at Fort William began burning their records in the kitchen {{fireplace}} to prevent Selkirk from discovering any information about the company’s trading tactics. At 3 pm, two of Selkirk’s officers, McNabb and McPherson {{and a number of}} armed soldiers approached the gates of Fort William and asked for permission to enter, presumably to negotiate with the NWC partners. However, as soon as the gates opened, a bugle was blown as a signal and the soldiers rushed through the gates and spread out throughout the fort. The NWC partner Hugh McGillis shouted for his voyageurs to take up arms, but they refused. Selkirk’s men soon had two of the fort’s cannons placed in the centre of the courtyard and guards spread through the fort. It is unknown whether Selkirk had actually planned to capture and occupy Fort William or if this plot was hatched by his subordinates, but Fort William was now firmly in his hands. The next day Lord Selkirk entered the fort, took a tour and received an official protest from the NWC partners. The Nor’Westers planned to retake the fort and hid 83 loaded fusils and a barrel of gunpowder from the fort’s magazine in a hay barn, but a NWC voyageur informed Selkirk of the cache and it was quickly confiscated, preventing any possible takeover. Selkirk’s men also confiscated eight kegs of gunpowder and four cases of trade guns that were <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> onto canoes with other trade goods heading into the interior. Many of these confiscated guns were issued to Selkirk’s men. The NWC would later sue Selkirk for the theft of these goods.|$|R
40|$|Abstract only availableBioprinting is {{a tissue}} {{engineering}} technique in which spherical cell aggregates, the "bio-ink", are deposited into biocompatible hydrogels, the "bio-paper", by a 3 -axis "bio-printer". The aggregates can be deposited into essentially any 3 D configuration, and when comprised of adhesive and motile cells aggregate fusion occurs. This self-organizing, liquid-like {{nature of these}} tissues is described on a molecular basis by The Differential Adhesion Hypothesis (DAH). The techniques we have developed are quite unique {{because of the high}} degree of automation that has been incorporated into our processes and the variety of engineered tissues that we are capable of creating. Despite automation, the creation of aggregates remains a nontrivial and time intensive process. The entire process of aggregate formation from initial cell culture <b>to</b> mature aggregate <b>ready</b> <b>to</b> be <b>loaded</b> into the printer takes approximately five days. This time is a limiting factor in the potential use of bio-printing as a source of on-demand tissues for clinical applications. A solution to this potential problem lies in the cryopreservation of aggregates. Freezing mediums and freezing protocols were tested and the effect of the freezing process on aggregate fusion was determined. An alternate solution to expedite the bioprinting process could lie in the printing of cell 'sausages', tightly packed cylinders of cells. In this method aggregate preparation is forgone. Elimination of this step could allow for increased time in tissue creation. Cell sausage printing provides another technique that could be incorporated into the fabrication of complex tissues. Our experiments in this novel and developing technology of bioprinting represent steps towards building complex tissues via self-assembly. McNair Scholars Progra...|$|R
