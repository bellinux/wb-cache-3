40|$|The {{prevalence}} of bioaerosol particles has gained significant {{attention in the}} past decades and {{is considered to be}} a potential health hazard for people in a variety of environments. To identify and quantify airborne microorganisms, the bioaerosols are collected directly on semisolid culture media, or trapped from air into liquid substrates, followed by culturing, counting, and identification of the resulting colony forming units. Studies on error due to overcrowding of the colonies have concluded that the bias did not become significant until about 300 colonies/plate were present, but no study has taken the non-homogeneity of colony size into account. In the present study, a Cartesian coordinate system was used to simulate the surface area of standard 100 mm diameter colony culture plates and the colonies growing on them. A resolution of 1000 x 1000 was found to be accurate enough to represent the actual size of the colony. The capacity of distinguishing overlapping colonies (defined as <b>resolution</b> <b>index)</b> the covering fraction, the colony surface density, and the colony size distribution were among the primary parameters investigated in this study. The counting efficiency was found to consistently decrease with increasing surface density and decreasing <b>resolution</b> <b>index.</b> The recommended upper limit of colony counts on each plate depended not only on the number concentration but also the size distribution of the colonies.

40|$|Introduction: Infections are a {{frequent}} complication {{and a major}} cause of death after acute spinal cord injury (SCI). Furthermore, infections are associated with minor functional outcome after central nervous system (CNS) injury. Mechanical ventilation or aspiration due to swallowing disorders alone do not sufficiently explain the high incidence of pneumonia after SCI. Aggravating effects of the Spinal Cord Injury-induced Immune Depression Syndrome (SCI-IDS), which is caused by a disruption of the normally well-balanced interactions between the immune system and the CNS, are most likely. Likewise, the injury-related inflammatory response might contribute to compensatory immune-depression. The resolution of inflammation in the CNS is delayed and probably incomplete. This work summarises three studies on immunological aspects of SCI. Methods: The resolution of leukocyte populations after SCI has been quantified using a model applicable for half-life kinetics. Cell-type-specific <b>resolution</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated: the resolution interval (days from maximum cell numbers to 50 % decrease) and the resolution ¬plateau (percentage of remaining cell numbers relative to the maximum). The hypothesis, that infections (pneumonia/post-operative wound infections) are associated with poor neurological recovery, was examined in a longitudinal, prospective, multicenter database. The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury were applied. Using multiple regression analysis we adjusted for demographic factors, injury severity and clinical characteristics. The prognostic SCIentinel-study aims at immunologically defining the SCI-IDS. The protocol is based on pilot trials. An administrative interim analysis comprises data on the completeness of the primary laboratory endpoint – HLA-DR expression on monocytes. Results: The <b>resolution</b> <b>indices</b> (<b>resolution</b> interval / resolution plateau) revealed clear cell types specific differences: neutrophils (1. 2 days / 0 %); T-lymphocytes (1. 5 days / 10 %); activated macrophages/microglia (55 days / 45 %). Infections after acute SCI were identified as independent risk factor for non-improvement in the ASIA impairment scale one year post-trauma (odds ratio 1. 89, p < 0. 0005). Additionally, an association of infections with lower gain in the ASIA motor score (regression coefficient: - 8. 21, p < 0. 0005) has been demonstrated. The interim feasibility evaluation of the SCIentinel-study was performed after inclusion of 60 patients, representing 50 % of the calculated sample size. The analysis revealed a principally sufficient to good data completeness. Conclusions: The newly introduced <b>resolution</b> plateau <b>index</b> allows for a systematic quantification of the „immunological scar” after CNS-injury. Infections may act as a disease-modifying factor after SCI by affecting neurological outcome. Using immunological markers, patients predisposed to develop infections might be identified and treated earlier in the future...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The binary {{partition}} tree (BPT) is {{a hierarchical}} region-based representation {{of an image}} in a tree structure. The BPT allows users to explore the image at different segmentation scales. Often, the tree is pruned to get a more compact represen-tation and so the remaining nodes conform an optimal partition for some given task. Here, we propose a novel BPT construction approach and pruning strategy for hyperspectral images based on spectral unmixing concepts. Linear spectral unmixing consists of finding the spectral signatures of the materials present in the image (endmembers) and their fractional abundances within each pixel. The proposed methodology exploits the local unmixing of the regions to find the partition achieving a global minimum reconstruction error. Results are presented on real hyperspectral data sets with different contexts and <b>resolutions.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms — Binary partition trees, hyperspectral images, spectral unmixing, segmentation...|$|R

40|$|The study {{examined}} how alerting and executive attention interact in a task involving conflict resolution. We proposed a tentative {{scenario in which}} an initial exogenous phasic alerting phase is followed by an endogenous tonic alerting phase, and hypothesized that these two processes may have distinct effects on conflict resolution. Phasic alerting was expected to increase the conflict, whereas tonic alerting was expected to decrease the conflict. Three experiments were conducted using different variants of the flanker task with visual alerting cues and varied cue-target intervals (SOA), to differentiate between effects of phasic alerting (short SOA) and tonic alerting (long SOA). The results showed that phasic alerting consistently decreased the efficiency of conflict <b>resolution</b> <b>indexed</b> by response time and accuracy, whereas tonic alerting increased the accuracy of conflict resolution, but at a cost in the speed of processing the conflict.

The method allows one to test an ADC with sinusoids of any reasonable amplitude (even a slight overdrive is allowed), frequency (no synchronization is needed), and phase (which is digitally compensated).

40|$|Abstract—Among {{existing}} ocean data assimilation method-ologies, reduced-state Kalman {{filters are}} a widely studied compromise between resolution, optimality, error specification, and computational feasibility. In such reduced-state filters, the measurement update {{takes place on}} a coarser grid {{than that of the}} general circulation model (GCM); therefore, these filters require mapping operators from the GCM grid to the reduced state and vice versa. The general requirements are that the state-reduction and interpolation operators be pseudoinverses of each other, that the coarse state define a closed dynamical system, that the mapping operations be insensitive to noise, and that they be appropriate for regions with irregular coastlines and bathymetry. In this paper, we describe three efficient algorithms for computing the pseudoinverse: a fast Fourier transform algorithm that serves for illustration purposes, an exact implicit method that is recommended for most applications, and an efficient iterative algorithm {{that can be used for}} the largest problems. The mapping performance of 11 interpolation kernels is evaluated. Surprisingly, common kernels such as bilinear, exponential, Gaussian, and sinc perform only moderately well. We recommend instead three kernels, smooth, thin-plate, and optimal interpolation, which have superior properties.
