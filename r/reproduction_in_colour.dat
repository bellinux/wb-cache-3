5000|$|After {{a private}} education, Grego worked briefly at Lloyd's the underwriters. As an art {{journalist}} and author, he specialised {{as a writer}} and collector in the works of James Gillray, Thomas Rowlandson, George Morland, Charles Dickens and George Cruikshank, and was an acknowledged authority on all of them. Chiefly responsible for the edition of James Gillray's 'works' (1873), and editing 'Rowlandson the Caricaturist' (1880), both cited as standard books of reference. He collected much material for a life of Morland, which he did not complete. In 1903, he published 'Cruickshank's Water Colours' with <b>reproductions</b> <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> (published by A.&C. Black, London, MCMIII (on the titlepage), on verso of the titlepage mentioned Published November 1903).

5000|$|Among Williamson' coauthored {{books is}} {{a study of the}} painter Angelica Kauffmann, one of the {{founding}} members of the Royal Academy of Arts (RA). Angelica Kauffmann, R.A.: Her Life and Her Works, written with Lady Victoria Manners, was prompted by the discovery in the RA archives of a manuscript in Kauffmann's handwriting, written in Italian and previously untranslated, which gives an account of Kauffmann's paintings post-1781. Manners and Williamson wrote that this enabled them to [...] "come to certain definite conclusions regarding many pictures hitherto ascribed to other artists." [...] They included numerous <b>reproductions</b> <b>in</b> both <b>colour</b> and black-and-white on the grounds that prior books on Kauffman had presented inadequate reproductions of her paintings.|$|R
40|$|Colour {{reproduction}} goals {{have traditionally}} been {{defined in terms of}} colorimetric, appearance-matching or preferred <b>reproductions.</b> <b>In</b> modern digital <b>colour</b> <b>reproduction</b> this paradigm is extended to include multiple reproduction goals for a single image, which transitions through a series of image states between initial capture and <b>reproduction.</b> The impetus <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> <b>reproduction</b> today is towards a more idealised encoding of both source and destination data, and a workflow where a reference intermediate colour space links standard source encodings, with a well defined relationship to colorimetry or appearance, to a virtual printing condition, based closely on real-world media and reproduction gamuts. Future colour reproduction systems must be standards-based where possible, and should support a highly flexible transform structure. They will need to go beyond the limitations of trichromatic colour matching for a fixed viewing condition and support multi-spectral colour reproduction, handling of high dynamic range image data, and be capable of applying appearance transforms to compensate for differences in viewing conditions. They will need to recognize the current ‘state’ of an image and process it accordingly. They will also need to handle multiple different rendering strategies to accommodate media and gamut differences, user preferences and so on. All this requires a dynamic and flexible colour reproduction architecture...|$|R
40|$|This paper first {{presents}} {{a summary of}} a psychophysical experiment in which observers made judgements about the types of differences they perceived between originals and <b>reproductions</b> <b>in</b> a cross–media <b>colour</b> image reproduction. The results of the observer–reported visual data from that experiment are then compared with analogous metrics extracted from colorimetric data of the corresponding originals and reproductions. While {{there is a good}} agreement in terms of the most general findings, looking at more detailed results shows significant differences between visual and colorimetrically–based data. The paper then proceeds to describe a colorimetrically based metric that takes into account some aspects of the visual system and using information both about the statistics of colour differences, of the original images and of changes to spatial characteristics is able to give a close prediction of observer responses. The final metric is proposed for further testing as a means of predicting observer responses of image difference <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> <b>reproduction</b> as well as in other applications...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the use of}} a new method of assessment and comparison of the appearance of <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> an art historical context, using some seventeenth century churches in Bulgaria as a case-study. The method also allows initial identification of the main colour agent of the pigments used. It contains the results of the identification of the colour red. This research provides a possible basis for further investigation into the use of <b>colour</b> <b>in</b> seventeenth century Bulgaria, in a way that overcomes the limitations of <b>colour</b> <b>reproduction</b> <b>in</b> print. In addition, a faithful and unambiguous record of the existing colours will make it possible to create the non-metameric subtractive mixtures that are needed for the restoration of the frescoes...|$|R

Fall detection is an emergent problem in pattern recognition. In this paper, a novel approach which enables to identify a type of a fall and reconstruct its characteristics is presented. The features detected include the position previous to a fall, the direction and velocity of a fall, and the postfall inactivity. Video sequences containing a possible fall are analysed image by image using the lateral inhibition in accumulative computation method. With this aim, the region of interest of human figures is examined in each image, and geometrical and kinematic characteristics for the sequence are calculated. The approach is valid <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> and <b>in</b> infrared video. 1...|$|R

50|$|When War broke out, Delville, amongst many Belgians, {{was welcomed}} in Britain as exiles. He moved {{there with his}} entire family, {{including}} his wife and four younger children and settled in Golders Green in London. His two oldest sons, Elie and Raphaël Delville, were conscripted into the Belgian War Effort (both survived the conflict). Delville played {{an active role in}} London, through his writings, art and public addresses (he was a gifted orator) in support of the Belgians in exile and the conflict against the Germans. He contributed to the Belgian expatriate newspaper in London, L'Indépendence Belge and wrote several articles and poems virulently condemning German aggression. He was {{an active member of the}} philanthropic society for Belgian refugees, La Ligue des Patriotes de Belgique, and was the president of La Ligue des Artistes belges that was responsible for the creation of the successful publication Belgian Art in Exile the sale of which raised money for Belgian charities in England. The work contains a great number of representative paintings and other works of art by contemporary Belgian artists. The volume was generally well received. The Sketch ran a supportive editorial in their January edition and gave informative information about the volume:Belgian Art in Exile is the title of a very attractive album of <b>reproductions,</b> mostly <b>in</b> <b>colour,</b> of paintings by exiled Belgian artists, with photographs of works by Belgian sculptors, which has been issued in aid of the Belgian Red Cross and other Belgian charitable institutions. The colour-plates, which are beautifully reproduced, show the high quality and great versatility of modern Belgian art. Particularly notable is a picture of a Moorish cavalry charge, by Alfred Bastien, who since he came to this country has done some fine work for the Illustrated London News. Among many other well-known Belgian artists represented are Albert Baertsoen, Jean Delville, Emile Claus, Herman Richir, Comte Jacques de Lalaing, and Paul Dubois. A fine painting by Frank Brangwyn - Mater Dolorosa Belgica - forms a pictorial introduction,” as the frontispiece. Maeterlinck contributes a eulogy of King Albert, and there are poems by Emile Verhaeren, Marcel Wyseur, and Jean Delville, who also writes an introduction. The volume is published by Colour (25, Victoria Street, S.W. at 5s. and (in cloth) 73. 6d., with a limited edition de luxe at £1. Both for itself and the cause it should command a wide sale.|$|R

Theaimofthestudywastoinvestigatetheeffect of bleaching on the colouration of tooth enamel and shear bond strength of orthodontic ceramic brackets based upon current whitening practice. The bleaching and bonding techniques were performed on extracted bovine teeth for the investigation of their colorimetric spectrum and the adhesive bond strength on surface enamel. One group was designated as the control group with no pre-treatment. Another group was treated with a 45 % hydrogen peroxide solution prior to bonding. The difference <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> was expressed as the Euclidian distance ΔE. The resulting shear bond strength was analyzed and evaluated by scores of Adhesion Remnant Index. Statistical analysis was performed using the Kruskall-Wallis and post-hoc test. The colorimetric analysis revealed {{statistically significant differences between}} original and bleached as well as bleached and debonded teeth setting off a blue colour shift. Furthermore, statistically {{there was no significant difference}} noted in bonding strength between non-treated surfaces and those treated with peroxide. It can be concluded that peroxide pre-treatment does result <b>in</b> <b>colour</b> differences of teeth. Bonding and debonding procedures seem to have no statistically significant influence on the enamel colour using current materials. 1...|$|R
