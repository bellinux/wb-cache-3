That is, the DNA may simply be replicated without expression, or it may be transcribed and translated and a recombinant protein is produced. Generally speaking, expression of a foreign gene requires restructuring the gene to include sequences that are required for producing an mRNA molecule that can be used by the host's translational apparatus (e.g. promoter, translational initiation signal, and transcriptional terminator). Specific changes to the host organism may be made to improve expression of the ectopic gene. In addition, changes may be needed to the coding sequences as well, to optimize translation, make the protein soluble, direct the recombinant protein to the proper cellular or extracellular location, and stabilize the protein from degradation.|$|E

Based on evolutionary sequence conservation and computational prediction of cis-elements in the regulatory region, I designed mutants and assayed their effects in a <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> reporter system. I electroporated TnI DNA-linked reporter constructs into Ciona zygotes and assayed reporter activity following 12 - 14 hr of development. These studies showed that a conserved E-box is essential for high-level embryonic tail muscle-specific expression whereas conserved MEF- 2 and overlapping CREB/TEF- 1 sites were not. I carried out functional promoter identification experiments and 5 ' RACE studies and localized the core-promoter/transcription start-site in the Ciona TnI gene.

Methods: We immunized mice with the parent and recombinant plasmids and sera were collected and tested for antibodies against pure recombinant proteins of RD 1 (PE 35, PPE 68, EsxA, EsxB) and RD 9 (EsxV), peptide mixtures of each protein and their individual peptides using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The optical density (OD) values were measured at 405 nm. E/C (OD in antigen-coated wells/OD in antigen uncoated wells) were calculated, and the values of E/C> 2 were considered positive.

40|$|Isolation of {{endogenous}} proteins from Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{has been}} facilitated by inserting encoding polypeptide affinity tags at the C-termini of chromosomal open reading frames (ORFs) using homologous recombination of DNA fragments. Tagged protein isolation {{is limited by}} a number of factors, including high cost of affinity resins for bulk isolation and low concentration of ligands on the resin surface, leading to low isolation efficiencies and trapping of contaminants. To address this, we have created a recombinant “CelTag” DNA construct from which PCR fragments can be created to easily tag C-termini of S. cerevisiae ORFs using selection for a nat 1 marker. The tag has a C-terminal cellulose binding module {{to be used in the}} first affinity step. Microgranular cellulose is very inexpensive and has an effectively continuous ligand on its surface, allowing rapid, highly efficient purification with minimal background. Cellulose-bound proteins are released by specific cleavage of an included site for TEV protease, giving nearly pure product. The tag can be lifted from the <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> either with or without a 13 x myc epitope tag between the target ORF and the TEV protease site. Binding of CelTag protein fusions to cellulose is stable to high salt, nonionic detergents, and 1 M urea, allowing stringent washing conditions to remove loosely associated components, as needed, before specific elution. It is anticipated that this reagent could allow isolation of protein complexes from large quantities of yeast extract, including soluble, membrane-bound, or nucleic acid-associated assemblies...|$|E

This is particularly true in late maturing species, which are considerable in size at sexual maturity. We are therefore exploring non-invasive methods of delivery to address this issue. For this talk, I will present our on-going work on the recombinant Southern Bluefin tuna luteinizing hormone (tuna LH), which we aim to deliver through the diet. LH regulates {{the final stages of}} maturation as well as the release of eggs in fish. These reproductive events are compromised in tuna broodstock held in captivity. Using molecular methods, we designed and created a <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> that encodes for the tuna LH. The construct can be converted into the functional hormone once introduced in live fish. We are collaborating with the laboratory of Prof Ming-Wei Lu, from National Taiwan Ocean University, who developed the technology to package DNA constructs in liposomes, which have been shown to protect DNA from stomach acids as well as facilitate the entry of DNA through the intestinal wall. We are currently evaluating the biological activity of the introduced recombinant tuna LH in tilapia, which belongs to the same phylogenetic order as tuna. As one of the indicators of the effect of the recombinant tuna LH, we are determining the expression level of the aromatase gene, {{which is one of the}} genes in the gonad that is directly regulated by LH.

40|$|E 1 is {{the largest}} open reading frame (ORF) of bovine {{papillomavirus}} type 1 (BPV- 1) and is highly conserved among all papillomaviruses, maintaining its size, amino acid composition, and location in the viral genome with respect to other early genes. Multiple viral replication functions have been mapped to the E 1 ORF of BPV- 1, and evidence suggested {{that more than one}} protein was encoded by this ORF. We previously identified a small protein (M) whose gene consists of two exons, one encoded by the 5 ' end of the E 1 ORF. We show here that a 68 -kilodalton (kDa) phosphoprotein made from the E 1 ORF can be detected in BPV- 1 -transformed cells, and we present evidence that this protein is encoded by sequences colinear with the entire E 1 ORF. The full-length E 1 protein immunoprecipitated from virally transformed cells and identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis comigrates with a protein expressed from a <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>construct</b> capable of producing only the complete E 1 protein. In addition, two different antisera directed against polypeptides encoded from either the 3 ' or the 5 ' end of the E 1 ORF both recognize the full-length E 1 product. A mutation converting the first methionine codon in the ORF to an isoleucine codon abolishes BPV- 1 plasmid replication and E 1 protein production. Consistent with the notion that this methionine codon is the start site for E 1, a mutant with a termination codon placed after the splice donor at nucleotide 1235 in E 1 produces a truncated protein with the molecular mass predicted from the primary sequence as well as the previously identified M protein. When visualized by immunostaining, the E 1 protein expressed in COS cells is localized to the cell nucleus. A high degree of similarity exists between the BPV- 1 E 1 protein and polyomavirus and simian virus 40 large-T antigens in regions of the T antigens that bind ATP. We show by ATP affinity labeling that the E 1 protein produced in COS cells binds ATP and that this activity is abolished by a point mutation which converts the codon for proline 434 to serine. Furthermore, this mutation renders the viral genome defective for DNA replication, suggesting that the ATP-binding activity of E 1 is necessary for its putative role in viral DNA replication.

40|$|The {{deletion}} end-points of {{a number}} of type I (less than monomeric) plasmid deletants obtained by transforming recA+ or recA- E. coli with linear pBR 322 DNA were determined by DNA sequencing. In both monodirectional and bidirectional deletions the recyclization point was normally characterized by recombination between directly repeated sequences of between 4 and 10 bp present on each arm of the linearized pBR 322 molecule. Frequently, short tracts of uninterrupted homology involved in recombinational recircularization were embedded in regions of relative non-homology. A model predicting the probability of matching sequences in either end of a linear plasmid molecule is presented. It is proposed that exonucleolytic processing of the exposed termini of linear plasmid molecules generates substrates for subsequent recombinational recyclization and deletion. The activity of host recombination and repair functions in recircularizing linear DNA molecules explains the generation of many of the aberrant <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> obtained during gene cloning procedures...|$|R

Such fusions are traditionally generated by transposon mutagenesis and identified by a suitable selection procedure. Alternatively, specific reporter fusions can be generated by cloning of DNA fragments containing promoters or other regulatory elements in reporter plasmids. Here, we describe a novel approach for the rapid generation of reporter gene fusions in single copies at defined positions in bacterial genomes. This technique utilizes the Red recombinase for the homologous recombination of PCR-generated cassettes containing various currently used reporter genes, such as those for β-galactosidase, luciferase, and green fluorescent protein. The approach allows the generation of transcriptional or translational reporter fusions in a single step without the requirement for <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> and is applicable to various enterobacterial species.

Cell surface class I antigen expression was strong in transferents made with class I-deficient lymphoblastoid cell line mutants. 144 (A-null),. 53 (B-null), and. 184 (A-null, B-null). Transferents expressing HLA-A 2 were recognized specifically by HLA-A 2 -specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes.

When introduced with vector pHPT (lacking Epstein-Barr virus oriP), the B 8 gene was inserted at different chromosomal locations. Introduction of the HLA-B 8 gene failed to restore antigen expression by HLA-B-null mutant. 174, providing evidence that, unlike mutants exemplified by. 53,. 144, and. 184, some HLA antigen loss mutants are deficient in a trans-acting function needed for class I antigen expression.

Transfection experiments leading to the over-expression of specific viral proteins in {{the presence or absence of}} various <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> designed to modulate the activity of the cellular SUMOylation system demonstrated that various viral proteins are also SUMOylated when over-expressed in mammalian cells.

40|$|Genetic and {{physiological}} manipulations {{can be carried}} out easily in teleost fishes due to their external fertilization and embryogenesis. These procedures are performed {{in the early stages of}} ontogenesis to produce the required characteristic, which then leads to an altered phenotype. Two trends in effective modification of genotype of fishes have been developed: (a) manipulation of the genome by inducing gynogenetic and androgenetic reproduction and (b) manipulation of ploidy. In both of these modifications the sex ratio is modified by genome manipulation, allowing the establishment of monosex populations and inbred lines. Individuals of sterile populations produced by genome manipulation usually show better growing rate than their fertile mates. Moreover, sterilization substantially reduces the risk of acclimatization, when exogenous fish species are imported into different aquatic ecosystems. In the early stages of ontogenesis — before the sex-determining genes are switched on in the progenitors of germ cells — physiological processes can also be manipulated with remarkable effects on phenotype. Alteration of the sex of young fish populations by hormonal treatments is a well-known example. For some commercially important species this method can be applied very effectively and has become general in the practice of breeding, while there are still many unelucidated questions in other species, including common carp. Present methods could be rapidly improved by combination of certain genetic {{and physiological}} manipulations. The genetically identical individuals of fish clones have both experimental and practical importance. A large number of clones can be produced and sustained in carp using a combination of different manipulations.

The experimental results produced by using these new techniques will increase our knowledge of the basic processes of fish biology. Together with traditional methods they will also hopefully contribute to the development of a more efficient and rapid carp breeding system in the future.

The variable parts of the HA genes were cloned into a basic construct containing the HA gene from an H 3 N 2 strain. The <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNAs</b> thus created encode different variable domains with neutralising epitopes from four recently circulating influenza A H 3 strains. The technology allows rapid production of <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> for vaccines that can induce antibody and, particularly, cellular immune responses. These new constructs were also capable of conferring protection to challenge in mice. The technology may hence be a valuable tool for rapid adaptation of influenza vaccines {{to changes in the}} circulating influenza strains...|$|R
50|$|Scientists {{associated}} with the initial development of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> methods recognized that the potential existed for organisms containing <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> to have undesirable or dangerous properties. At the 1975 Asilomar Conference on <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA,</b> these concerns were discussed and a voluntary moratorium on <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research was initiated for experiments that were considered particularly risky. This moratorium was widely observed until the National Institutes of Health (USA) developed and issued formal guidelines for rDNA work. Today, <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules and <b>recombinant</b> proteins are usually not regarded as dangerous. However, concerns remain about some organisms that express <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA,</b> particularly when they leave the laboratory and are introduced into the environment or food chain. These concerns {{are discussed in the}} articles on genetically modified organisms and genetically modified food controversies.|$|R

Cathepsin B (Cat B 2) is a major cysteine protease secreted by the juvenile flukes. To enhance the immune responses of Cat B 2, the cDNA sequence was fused with four different DNA vaccine vectors. The induced cellular and antibody responses were compared in vaccinated mice. MethodsThe following <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> vaccine <b>constructs</b> were constructed: empty vector VR 1012 as negative control, cytoplasmic construct pVR 1012 Cat B 2, secretory construct pVR 1020 Cat B 2, chemokine-fused construct pMCP 3 Cat B 2 and lymph node targeting construct pCTLA- 4 Cat B 2. Plasmids were constructed using standard procedures, and positive constructs screened and selected using restriction digestion analysis followed by sequence analysis. The constructs were then tested in Cos- 7 cells for in vitro expression, which was analysed using immunoblotting. Subsequently, female BALB/c mice were immunised with <b>DNA</b> <b>constructs</b> as vaccines. Elicited antibody responses were measured using ELISA. The ratio between IgG 1 and IgG 2 a antibody responses was estimated among different vaccine groups. IgG antibody avidity assay was performed and the relative avidity index was calculated. The induced cytokine production from splenocytes of vaccinated animals was estimated using ELISPOT. ResultsDNA vaccine constructs carrying Cat B 2 were expressed in Cos- 7 cell lines and encoded protein was recognised using western blotting using rat anti- cathepsin B antibody. DNA vaccines elicited high Cat B 2 - specific IgG, IgG 1, IgE and also modest IgG 2 a antibody responses. Cat B 2 specific IL- 4  T cell responses were also observed in Cat B 2 vaccinated mice. The comparison of immunogenic potential {{in each of these}} constructs was demonstrated as enhanced antibody responses on the lymph-node targeting vector pCTLA- 4 Cat B 2, the high antibody avidity of chemo-attractant pMCP 3 Cat B 2 and stronger T cellular responses of non-secretory DNA vaccine pVR 1012 Cat B 2 in vaccinated animals. ConclusionThis study showed that the targeting DNA vaccine strategies enhanced specific immune responses to juvenile fluke Cat B 2.

40|$|<b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> is a {{technique}} of major importance in basic biomedical research and, increasingly, in industrial applications. Although the risks of this research remain hypothetical, scientists {{working in the field}} have spearheaded discussions of safety. The original National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guidelines for <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> Research were issued in June 1976. They assigned each type of <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> experiment a specific level of "physical containment" and of "biological containment. " Responsibility for overseeing the application of the guidelines belongs to the NIH <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> Advisory Committee (RAC) [...] composed of scientists and laymen, including non-voting representatives from many Federal agencies [...] and local institutional biosafety committees at each university where <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research is conducted. The NIH guidelines were subsequently adopted by other Federal agencies, but congressional proposals aimed at extending the guidelines to private industry did not result in national legislation. Some States and localities regulate <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> research, however, and many private companies have voluntarily submitted information on their <b>recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> work for RAC and NIH approval. The NIH guidelines underwent a major revision in December 1978 and have been revised approximately every 3 months since then.

40|$|Haloacid dehalogenases are {{enzymes that}} {{catalyze}} the hydrolytic removal of halogens from haloalkanoic acids. Dehalogenase IVa (DehIVa) from Burkholderia cepacia MBA 4 and dehalogenase CI (DehCI) from Pseudomonas sp. strain CBS 3 exhibit 68 % identity. Despite their similarity DehIVa is a dimeric enzyme while DehCI is a monomer. In this work, {{we describe the}} identification of the domain that confers the dimerization function of DehIVa. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules were <b>constructed</b> by fusion of the respective dehalogenase genes hdlIVa and dehCI. When amino acids 73 to 89 of DehCI were replaced by amino acids 74 to 90 of DehIVa, the recombinant molecule migrated like that of DehIVa in a nondenaturing activity-stained gel. Similarly, when residues 73 to 89 of DehIVa were replaced by the corresponding residues of DehCI the chimera migrated as a monomer. These 17 amino acid changes were able to determine the aggregation states of the molecules. The retention of the catalytic function in these chimeras indicated that the overall folding of these proteins was not affected. Site-directed mutagenesis on hdlIVa however indicated that amino acids Phe 58, Thr 65, Leu 78, and Phe 92 of DehIVa are also important for the aggregation state of the protein. This indicates that the 17 residues are not sufficient for the dimerization of the protein. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|We {{studied the}} structure, {{organization}} and relationship of repetitive DNA sequences in the genome of the scallop, Pecten maximus, a bivalve {{that is important}} both commercially and in marine ecology. <b>Recombinant</b> <b>DNA</b> libraries were <b>constructed</b> after partial digestion of genomic DNA from scallop with PstI and ApaI restriction enzymes. Clones containing repetitive DNA were selected by hybridisation to labelled DNA from scallop, oyster and mussel; colonies showing strong hybridisation only to scallop were selected for analysis and sequencing. Six non-homologous tandemly repeated sequences were identified in the sequences, and Southern hybridisation with all repeat families to genomic DNA digests showed characteristic ladders of hybridised bands. Three families had monomer lengths around 40 bp while three had repeats characteristic of the length wrapping around one (170 bp), or two (326 bp) nucleosomes. In situ hybridisation to interphase nuclei showed each family had characteristic numbers of clusters indicating contrasting arrangements. Two of the repeats had unusual repetitions of bases within their sequence, which may relate {{to the nature of}} microsatellites reported in bivalves. The study of these rapidly evolving sequences is valuable to understand an important source of genomic diversity, has the potential to provide useful markers for population studies and gives a route to identify mechanisms of DNA sequence evolution. 1337...|$|R
