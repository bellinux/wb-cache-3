40|$|Abstract — The {{potential}} {{analysis of}} having electric vehicles (EVs) provide <b>regulating</b> {{power has been}} implemented. The possible <b>regulating</b> power capacity from EVs and the economic return for EV users by providing <b>regulating</b> power are obtained. A spot price based charging schedule scenario {{has been used to}} do the day-ahead charging schedule for all EVs based on the predicted driving pattern. On top of the obtained charging schedule, the predicted EV availability and the charging schedule are used to calculate the possible <b>regulating</b> power capacity from EVs for both up <b>regulating</b> power and down <b>regulating</b> power. The activated <b>regulating</b> power and <b>regulating</b> power prices in the Denmark West System in 2010 have been used to calculate the economic return for EV users if all the <b>regulating</b> power is provided by EVs...|$|R

30|$|Previously TERF 1 {{was found}} to <b>regulate</b> nuclear gene {{expression}} through binding the cis-element of DRE and GCC box. Our study reveals new potential mechanisms of TERF 1 in <b>regulating</b> nuclear gene expression. Firstly, TERF 1 can <b>regulate</b> nuclear gene expression through different retrograde signals derived from chloroplast. We have confirmed the interaction between ethylene signaling and retrograde signaling mediated by TERF 1 through Q-PCR method, which <b>regulates</b> the expression of PhANGs, plastid redox-associated nuclear genes (PRANGs), singlet oxygen responsive genes (SORGs) (Wu et al. 2018). These retrograde signals not only <b>regulate</b> nuclear gene expression but also connect with different signaling pathways in response to environmental stress as described above. Secondly, TERF 1 can <b>regulate</b> gene expression not only at transcriptional level but also at posttranscriptional level. Our analysis shows that TERF 1 can <b>regulate</b> Pi uptake at posttranscriptional level through <b>regulating</b> different miRNA. The detailed mechanism of TERF 1 <b>regulating</b> nuclear gene expression at posttranscriptional level deserves detailed research in the future, which can enrich our knowledge about ethylene signaling pathway.|$|R

5|$|Enzymes {{determine}} what steps occur in these pathways. Without enzymes, metabolism would neither {{progress through the}} same steps {{and could not be}} <b>regulated</b> to serve the needs of the cell. Most central metabolic pathways are <b>regulated</b> at a few key steps, typically through enzymes whose activity involves the hydrolysis of ATP. Because this reaction releases so much energy, other reactions that are thermodynamically unfavorable can be coupled to ATP hydrolysis, driving the overall series of linked metabolic reactions.|$|E

5|$|Genes are <b>regulated</b> so {{that they}} are {{expressed}} only when the product is needed, since expression draws on limited resources. A cell regulates its gene expression depending on its external environment (e.g. available nutrients, temperature and other stresses), its internal environment (e.g. cell division cycle, metabolism, infection status), and its specific role if in a multicellular organism. Gene expression can be <b>regulated</b> at any step: from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, to post-translational modification of the protein. The regulation of lactose metabolism genes in E. coli (lac operon) was the first such mechanism to be described in 1961.|$|E
