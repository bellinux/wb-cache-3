An investigation has been conducted {{to determine the effect}} of the cornering condition on the aerodynamics of a simple bluff-body. A comparison study of the Ahmed reference model [1] travelling in a straight line and through a constant <b>radius</b> <b>corner</b> has been conducted. A commercial solver ANSYS Fluent 14. 5 was utilised to perform Detached-Eddy simulations (DES) of both conditions. Simulations were validated against straight-line experimental data. The flow conditions through a corner were found to result in significant changes to the structure of the time-averaged near wake. The dominant longitudinal vortices were affected in size, strength and trajectory when compared to the straight line case.

40|$|As {{a vehicle}} travels through a corner, the flowfield {{observed}} from the vehicle׳s {{frame of reference}} becomes curved. This condition results in the relative flow angle and freestream velocity changing both across the width and {{along the length of}} the body. Wall-resolved Large Eddy Simulations were used to simulate a simple vehicle shape through three different radii corners. The variable flow angle and acceleration affected the pressure distribution along either side of the body and caused an increase in the size of the outboard C-pillar vortex, and an inboard decrease. Furthermore, an outboard extension of the separation bubble at the bluff trailing face resulted in a gentler downwash angle off the backlight surface, with the opposite occurring inboard. At a Reynolds number of 1. 7 × 106, a 19. 2 % increase in aerodynamic drag occurred for a five car-length <b>radius</b> <b>corner</b> when compared to the straight-line condition. In addition, a yawing moment acted against the rotation of the body through the corner, and a side force acted towards the centre of the corner.

An attempt has been made hereby to investigate the experimental behaviour of GFRP wrapped small scale square RC columns with varying <b>corner</b> <b>radii.</b> Experimentally evaluated behaviour of GFRP wrapped RC columns is compared with the performance observed for non-wrapped RC columns. 15 RC columns having cross-sectional dimensions 125 mm × 125 mm and length of 1200 mm have been tested under axial compression. Three columns are unwrapped and have been designated as control specimens. Three columns each with <b>corner</b> <b>radius</b> equivalent to cover of 25 mm are wrapped with one and two layers of GFRP, respectively.

In this work, the effect of variation of <b>corner</b> <b>radius,</b> on thermo- hydrodynamic characteristics of a three dimensional model of T-junction square mini-channel duct of 2 mm sides is studied under constant heat flux applied (H 2 type) on the horizontal part. The length of horizontal section is 300 mm. The T junction is placed at the middle of 60 mm long vertical section. The numerical simulation was done in general purpose CFD package FLUENT. The simulation is performed for two Reynolds number, one in laminar flow range (Re 1000) and the other in turbulent flow range (Re 3200). It is observed that incorporation of fillets at T-junction changed the nature of the fluid flow and heat transfer locally. Variations in velocity and Nusselt number have been observed in both the laminar and turbulent flow regime. Within developing region local velocity is found to be increasing with increase in <b>corner</b> <b>radii</b> towards downstream of the channel in laminar and turbulent flow.
