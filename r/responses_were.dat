The old Russian administrations were replaced in 125 out of the 280 volosts (82 in Kaunas, 33 in Suvalkai, and 10 in Vilnius Governorates). These communities elected their own representatives, organized their own schools where classes were taught in the Lithuanian language, and stopped paying taxes. While the first Russian <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> disorganized and confused, the authorities soon marshaled their armed forces and returned the situation back to normal. The process was relatively peaceful; {{there were only a few}} clashes between armed groups of peasants and Tsarist military forces. Unlike in neighboring Latvia or Estonia, peasants did not rise against their landlords. A number of the most prominent activists of this movement were arrested and sent to Siberia.|$|E

A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed.

5|$|The {{information}} Bukovsky {{had gathered}} {{and sent to}} the West galvanized human rights activists worldwide and those within the Soviet Union. It also struck a chord among psychiatrists. In September that year 44 European psychiatrists wrote to The Times (London) expressing grave doubts about the diagnoses of the six people concerned. At a meeting in November 1971, the World Federation for Mental Health called on its members to investigate the charges and defend the right to free opinion where it was threatened. These <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> carefully documented by the dissident human rights periodical Chronicle of Current Events, which also recorded the many statements made by Bukovsky's friends and fellow rights activists in his defence. As the person at the centre of this unprecedented international row, Bukovsky waited in almost total isolation, without access to a lawyer, to be tried {{and sent to the}} camps or a special psychiatric hospital.|$|E

40|$|Characteristics {{of sensory}} responses. Even though sensory <b>responses</b> <b>are</b> diverse and occur in {{different}} complex environments, {{it is possible}} to derive some characteristics common to all responses: 1) For a given subject the sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> unusual and abnormal because two conditions must be respected: the individuality of the response and the blind presentation of the samples. 2) When it hasn't been learned, the sensory <b>response</b> <b>is,</b> more or less, specific to the subject who gives the response. 3) The sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> not only a mechanical translation of events produced at the receptor level; it is an event which is largely cognitive. 4) The sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> changeable and unstable in time {{because of the nature of}} the nervous system and the conditions of taking the samples. 5) The sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> often obtained by means of verbal expression and the words may imperfectly translate the perception. Despite these characteristics, the sensory <b>response</b> <b>is</b> irreplaceable; it can be reliable when the operator who obtains it controls the experiment with care...|$|R

During that time, various <b>responses</b> <b>were</b> developed against the 4.Bf4 line; these included 4...g5, invented by István Abonyi, further developed by the masters Bakonyi and Drimer. The master Kaposztas showed that even when White succeeded in his positional plan, it only meant for Black a worse endgame with drawish tendencies. Two pawn sacrifices were also introduced in the variation with 6.Nbd2 (still in the 4.Bf4 line), based on pawn pushes d7–d6 or f7–f6 and a quick attack against b2.|$|E
