Previously, {{it has been shown that}} prolonged whole body VO 2 <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics</b> are directly related to disease severity and all-cause mortality in HFrEF patients. To date, no study has simultaneously measured muscle-specific blood flow and oxygen extraction post exercise <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics</b> in HFrEF or HFpEF patients; therefore it is unknown if muscle VO 2 <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics,</b> and more specifically, the <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics</b> of blood flow and oxygen extraction at the level of the muscle, differ between HF phenotypes. Ten older (68 ± 10 yrs) HFrEF (n = 5) and HFpEF (n = 5) patients performed sub-maximal (85 % of maximal weight lifted during an incremental test) ULKE exercise for 4 minutes. Femoral venous blood flow and venous O 2 saturation were measured continuously from the onset of end-exercise, using a novel MRI method, to determine off-kinetics (mean response times, MRT) for leg VO 2 and its determinants. HFpEF and HFrEF patients had similar end-exercise leg blood flow (1. 1 ± 0. 6 vs. 1. 2 ± 0. 6 L/min, p> 0. 05), venous saturation (42 ± 12 vs. 41 ± 11 %, p> 0. 05) and VO 2 (0. 13 ± 0. 08 vs. 0. 11 ± 0. 05 L/min, p> 0. 05); however HFrEF had significantly delayed recovery MRT for flow (292 ± 135 sec. vs 105 ± 63 sec., p = 0. 004) and VO 2 (95 ± 37 sec. vs. 47 ± 15 sec., p = 0. 005) compared to HFpEF.

BackgroundPatients with CHF may have reduced strength and endurance in inspiratory muscles, which may contribute to exercise intolerance and is associated with a poor prognosis. MethodsThirty-two patients with CHF and weakness of inspiratory muscles (maximal inspiratory pressure [Pimax] < 70 % of predicted) were randomly assigned to a 12 -week program of inspiratory muscle training (IMT, 16 patients) or to a placebo-inspiratory muscle training (P-IMT, 16 patients).

The present study aimed to investigate whether measurements of muscle and pulmonary oxygen uptake kinetics {{can be used to}} assess oxygen delivery limitations in healthy subjects. Methods: Sixteen healthy young adults performed three sub-maximal exercise tests (6 min at 40 % Wmax) under hypoxic (14 %O 2), normoxic (21 %O 2) and hyperoxic (35 %O 2) conditions on separate days in randomized order. Both Pulmonary VO 2 and near infra red spectroscopy (NIRS) based Tissue Saturation Index (TSI) offset kinetics were calculated using mono-exponential curve fitting models. Results: Time constant τ of VO 2 offset kinetics under hypoxic (44. 9  ±  7. 3 s) conditions were significantly larger than τ of the offset kinetics under normoxia (37. 9  ±  8. 2 s, p =  0. 02) and hyperoxia (37 ± 6 s, p =  0. 04). TSI mean response time (MRT) of the offset kinetics under hypoxic conditions (25. 5  ±  13 s) was significantly slower than under normoxic (15  ±  7. 7, p =  0. 007) and hyperoxic (13  ±  7. 3, p =  0. 008) conditions.

40|$|Background: The {{delay in}} O 2 uptake {{kinetics}} {{during and after}} submaximal physical activity (O 2 onset and <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics,</b> respectively) correlates well with the functional capacity of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). This study examined the physiological background of this delay in moderately impaired CHF patients by comparing kinetics of cardiac output (Q?) and O 2 uptake (V?O 2). Methods: Fourteen stable CHF patients (New York Heart Association class II-III) and 8 healthy subjects, matched for age and body mass index, were included. All subjects performed a submaximal constant-load exercise test to assess O 2 uptake kinetics. Furthermore, in 10 CHF patients Q? was measured by a radial artery pulse contour analysis method, which enabled the simultaneous modelling of exercise-related kinetics of Q? and V?O 2. Results: Both O 2 onset and <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics</b> were delayed in the patient group. There {{were no significant differences}} between the time constants of Q? and V?O 2 during exercise-onset (62 -Ý 25 - s versus 59 -Ý 28 - s, p = 0. 51) or recovery (61 -Ý 25 - s versus 57 -Ý 20 - s, p = 0. 38) in the patient group, indicating that O 2 delivery was not in excess of the metabolic demands in these patients.

The pathophysiological background of this impairment is not well established.

Thirteen stable CHF patients (New York Heart Association class II-III) and 8 healthy subjects, matched for age and BMI were included. All subjects performed repetitive submaximal dynamic single-leg extensions in the supine position. Post-exercise phosphocreatine (PCr) resynthesis was assessed by 31 P magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Near-infrared spectroscopy was applied simultaneously, using the rate of decrease in deoxygenated hemoglobin (HHb) as an index of post-exercise muscle re-oxygenation. As expected, PCr recovery was slower in CHF patients than in control subjects (time constant: 47 ± 10 sec versus 35 ± 12 sec, P= 0. 04). HHb <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics</b> were also prolonged in CHF patients (mean response time: 74 ± 41 sec versus 44 ± 17 sec, P= 0. 04).

In astrocytes, endogenous ATP-evoked currents with kinetics and pharmacology characteristic of the heteromeric P 2 X 1 / 5 receptor channel have recently been reported. We investigated the interaction of major phosphoinositides with heteromeric P 2 X 1 / 5 channels. Using patch-clamp electrophysiology on enhanced green fluorescent protein-expressing astrocytes acutely isolated from cortical slices of transgenic mice, we report a strong modulation of P 2 X 1 / 5 -like currents by phosphoinositides. Wortmannin-induced depletion of phosphoinositides decreases the amplitude of both the fast and sustained component of the P 2 X 1 / 5 -like currents although <b>recovery</b> and <b>kinetics</b> remain intact. In transfected human embryonic kidney cells, we provide evidence that depleting phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -bisphosphate [PI(4, 5) P- 2] levels significantly decreases P 2 X 1 / 5 currents while intracellular application of PI(4, 5) P- 2 completely rescued P 2 X 1 / 5 currents, ruling out the involvement of phosphatidylinositol 3, 4, 5 -trisphosphate.

The estimated kinetics of nucleation, the mean stored energy evolution as well as the preferential texture of first nuclei are in agreement with experimental observations for annealing 40 % cold-rolled IF-Ti steel and cold drawn copper wires. Introduction. The Monte Carlo modeling is a classical tool in recrystallization studies [1].

40|$|Plasma {{treatment}} of polymer films results in their electrical charging, {{which in turn}} gives rise {{to an increase in}} their surface energy. The process results in pronounced hydrophilization of the polymer surfaces. A phenomenological theory relating the change in the apparent contact angle of charged solids to the surface density of the electrical charge is introduced. Partial wetting, inherent for polymer films, becomes possible until the threshold surface density of the electrical charge is gained. The predictions of the theory are illustrated by plasma-treated polymer films and inflatable latex balloons. Deflating the plasma treated latex balloons resulted in an essential increase in the surface charge density of the latex. This increase switched the wetting regime from partial to complete wetting. The <b>kinetics</b> of hydrophobic <b>recovery</b> follows the <b>kinetics</b> of the electrical charge leakage from the surfaces of the plasma treated polymers.

40|$|Short-term {{exercise}} training {{may induce}} metabolic and performance adaptations before {{any changes in}} mitochondrial enzyme potential. However, {{there has not been}} a study that has directly assessed changes in mitochondrial oxidative capacity or metabolic control as a consequence of such training in vivo. Therefore, we used 31 P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31 P-MRS) to examine the effect of short-term plantar flexion exercise training on phosphocreatine (PCr) <b>recovery</b> <b>kinetics</b> and the control of respiration rate.

40|$|The {{extraction}} of metals from ores {{by means of}} appropriate solvents has been practised for many years. A number of methods involve leaching of crushed ores held in tanks or ponds in which the solvent is sprayed over the ore, of which effectiveness is enhanced by mechanical agitation and increased temperature and pressure. In contrast, this investigation uses a high-velocity impinging stream reactor to induce micro-cracking in the ore phase, and consequently enhance leaching kinetics by improved solvent/ore contact. Initial tests show that jet reactor leaching of a free milling ore can increase gold recovery by 10 % while decreasing leaching time by up to 90 %. Further investigation is required regarding refractory ores, {{taking into account the}} complex mineralogy of each ore. The three refractory ores that were tested, all behaved very similarly when subjected to jet reaction. There is no apparent improvement in <b>recovery.</b> However, leaching <b>kinetics</b> are dramatically increased when these ores are subjected to jet reaction prior to agitation. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|There {{is a lack}} of {{data for}} how the {{viability}} of biological agents may degrade over time in different environments. In this study, experiments were conducted to determine the persistence of Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus subtilis spores on outdoor materials with and without exposure to simulated sunlight, using ultraviolet (UV) -A/B radiation. Spores were inoculated onto glass, wood, concrete, and topsoil and recovered after periods of 2, 14, 28, and 56 days. <b>Recovery</b> and inactivation <b>kinetics</b> for the two species were assessed for each surface material and UV exposure condition. Results suggest that with exposure to UV, decay of spore viability for both Bacillus species occurs in two phases, with an initial rapid decay, followed by a slower inactivation period. The exception was with topsoil, in which there was minimal loss of spore viability in soil over 56 days, with or without UV exposure. The greatest loss in viable spore recovery occurred on glass with UV exposure, with nearly a four log 10 reduction after just two days. In most cases, B. subtilis had a slower rate of decay than B. anthracis, although less B. subtilis was recovered initially...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigated}} the kinetics of Hg(II) and MeHg accumulation and {{the synthesis of}} phytochelatins (PCs), cysteine (Cys), glutathione (GSH), and gamma-glutamylcysteine (gamma-EC) in a marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii during a 3 -h (short-term) and a 96 -h (long-term) exposure period, and during a subsequent 96 -h recovery period. MeHg induced the synthesis of a significant level of GSH, but it was Hg(II) {{that gave rise to}} significant levels of other non-protein thiol compounds. The thiol compounds Cys, gamma-EC, and PC 2 - 3 were induced in T. weissflogii within the first 30 min of exposure, followed by PC 4, but the concentrations of all six compounds returned to the control levels after the 96 -h <b>recovery</b> period. The <b>kinetics</b> of these non-protein thiol compounds pointed to a rapid cellular response to environmental mercury pollution. After a first decrease, the molar ratio of PC-SH (sulfhydryl in PCs) to intracellular Hg increased slightly which demonstrated the role of PCs in Hg(II) detoxification. However, PC-SH was bound with Hg(II) at a stoichiometric ratio of 0. 1 - 0. 3, indicating the involvement of other detoxification mechanisms. Elucidating the effects of mercury on intracellular non-protein thiol pools may help us better understand the metal detoxification in phytoplankton. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
