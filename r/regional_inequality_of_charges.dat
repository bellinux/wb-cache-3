40|$|This {{paper is}} to analyze the effect of trade {{openness}} on <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> South Korea. Trade has been {{the driving force of}} Korea 1 economic growth since the 19601 and it still expands its trade openness through active participation on bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. In regard to this, this study measures the impact of Korea 1 trade openness on the country 1 <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> using several sub-national panel dataset covering between 2003 and 2012. All data set for the 16 regional units (nine provinces and seven metropolitan cities) are collected from archival materials in Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS). The dependent variable is the growth rate of GDP per capita from. 2000 to 2012, while the explanatory variables include human capital, trade openness, infrastructure, and per capita income. More specifically, human capital is measured by {{the number of people who}} have achieved university level education and infrastructure is measured by either road density or per capita number of cars, depending on data availability. Unlike other studies, this paper finds that trade openness contributes to higher level of economic growth on the regions with lower levels of education, implying that trade openness leads reducing <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> Korea. In addition, trade benefits the areas with relatively lower per capita income, which also supports the claim that trade contributes to narrowing the regional income discrepancies. However, a seemingly contradictory finding has been made; more trade openness benefits regions which have rich infrastructure, thereby leading more <b>regional</b> <b>inequality.</b> We argue that the former two effects exceed the latter, thereby leading concluding that trade openness has been playing a positive role in reducing the country 1 regional income gap...|$|R

The NLDI was extracted based on a Gini Coefficient approach to measure the spatial differences of population distribution and night light distribution. Population data were derived from the dataset of China’s population density grid, and night light data were acquired from satellite imagery. In the multi-scale analysis, we calculated the NLDI for China as a whole, eight economic regions, 31 provincial regions, and 354 prefectural cities for the two years of 2005 and 2010. The results indicate that Southwest China and Northwest China are the regions with the most unequal public services, with NLDI values of 0. 7116 and 0. 7251 for 2005, respectively, and 0. 6678 and 0. 6304 for 2010, respectively. In contrast, Northern Coastal China had the lowest NLDI values of 0. 4775 and 0. 4312 for 2005 and 2010, respectively, indicating that this region had the most equal public services. Also, the <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> Mainland China in terms of NLDI has been reduced from 0. 6161 to 0. 5743 during 2005 – 2010.

Our starting {{hypothesis is that}} the evolution <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>inequalities</b> should follow a bell-shaped curve depending {{on the level of}} national economic development. Â A number of authors going from Kuznets (1955) to Lucas (2000) have provided extensive theoretical arguments along this line suggesting that growth, because of its very nature, is unlikely to appear everywhere at the same time. <b>Regional</b> <b>inequalities</b> should then rise when countries start developing and then fall once a certain level of national economic development is reached as long as spillovers are strong enough to transmit growth and technological progress across regions. We test empirically these predictions by using regional data for a panel of European countries and by making use of semi-parametric estimation techniques. Our results provide strong support for a bell-shaped curve in the relationship between the national GDP per capita level and the extent <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>inequalities</b> independently <b>of</b> the time period and regional administrative units considered.

The mortality intensity was analysed through age- standardized mortality rates and life expectancy at birth. These indicators enabled international comparison of NUTS 2 regions. More detailed analysis was created for five main groups of causes of death: diseases of the circulatory system, neoplasms, diseases of the respiratory system, diseases of the digestive system and external causes of mortality. Generally, the age-standardized cause-specific mortality decreased in Europe but in some regions it increased. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{industrial development}} from regional perspectives. It {{is composed of}} three parts: spatial adaptation of the Murphy, Shleifer, and Vishny (MSV) Model, application of the model to North Korea's Kaesong Industrial Complex, and an analysis <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> South Korea. Chapter 1 uses a combination of methods from economic development and economic geography. Departing from the MSV Model that views the poverty trap and industrialization as two Nash equilibria, this paper suggests the possibility of partial industrialization as equilibrium. In {{the beginning of an}} agglomeration, participating firms in a certain area may observe external economies with a decreasing fixed cost and rising productivity. However, once the number of firms exceeds a certain threshold of agglomeration capacity, the region will experience various congestion problems that may block further development and it will get stuck in a state of partial industrialization. Nevertheles, by Critical Minimum Effort, an economy may get out of this partial industrialization and reach the status of full industrialization as long as it overcomes congestion problems, as has been true for Mexico City, and Upper Silesia in Poland, and Seoul in Korea. Chapter 2 again uses the MSV Model to suggest a possibility for development in the Kaesong area of North Korea. More specifically, this paper deals with the effect of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, where South Korean technology and North Korean labor are combined. Using the MSV Model, this paper predicts {{that if there is a}} sustained effort to maintain the momentum of the Kaesong Industrial Complex, then this will have large spillover effects in the entire region, resulting in a big push which breaks the poverty trap and leads to full industrialization. These two chapters focus on the developments of certain regions in themselves. However, development of various regions can be viewed in comparative terms, in which case <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> becomes an important issue. Against this backdrop, Chapter 3 analyzes the pattern <b>of</b> inter-regional <b>inequality</b> by comparing the per capita GDPs of 15 South Korean provinces. Using Theil's T Index, this research analyzes increasing or decreasing trend <b>of</b> <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> in South Korea, and then, decomposes the country into two different categories (Honam and non-Honam, Gangwon and non-Gangwon, urban and rural) and looks into the inequalities between the groups. Also, in investigating possible factors that may affect <b>regional</b> <b>inequality,</b> this research finds that trade openness, physical capital, and human capital are the three main factors involved and that a certain coordinated investment is needed to minimize <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> the country, without compromising on development...|$|R

The official data on China’s regional GDP and the regional GDP of three industrial sectors from 1991 – 2001, {{as reported in the}} China Statistical Yearbook and A Statistical Survey of China, are adopted to calculate and decompose the Gini coefficient for each year. The primary finding is that the levels <b>of</b> <b>inequality</b> in China’s <b>regional</b> economies clearly showed a slight upward trend after 1991. The <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> the overall GDP is primarily attributed to the between-group effect rather than to the within-group effect.

A Spatial Markov Chain is used to identify the dynamics of regional wealth disparity in Zhejiang. The {{results show that the}} <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> Zhejiang is sensitive to the geographic scale of the analysis. In addition, the inter-county inequality shows an inverted-U shape pattern. At the same time, the inter-municipality inequality displays a more consistently upward trend, and the evolution <b>of</b> the interregional <b>inequality</b> is relatively stable over time. The <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> is more significant at finer (larger) spatial scales. The decomposition of the Theil Index shows that the contribution <b>of</b> the <b>inequalities</b> between Northeast Zhejiang and Southwest Zhejiang increased. The increasingly larger values of the Global Moran’s I show that there is an intensifying spatial aggregation of economic development. The comparison of the traditional Markov transition matrix and the Spatial Markov transition matrix illustrates how the relative wealth or poverty of neighboring counties make a significance difference in wealth in a given county as measured using domestic GDP per capita in Zhejiang province. This space-time analysis is valuable for policy making towards sustainable economic development in China given the soaring spatial inequality...|$|R

This has as central component the establishment of supranational institutional forms (such as European Union). Economic integration combined with the function of the open market did not result in the elimination <b>of</b> <b>inequalities.</b> Forecasted convergence was far from reached. Historically, in some regions local populations developed ethnically premised movements in order to defend their local identity and culture and promote their relative economic position. Emanating out of an array of distinct ethnic, cultural, religious, societal and economic backgrounds, in many cases such localist movements looked down on their central state government and national institutions and aspired towards the development of alternative localist institutions arrangements. This paper examines the complex inter-determinations between localist movements and <b>regional</b> <b>inequalities,</b> the type and function of the emerging inter-relationships, and their resulting impacts on the acuteness of the two sets of phenomena examined. Negotiating between contrasting theoretical claims we shall examine the evolution of specific localist movements in relation to the <b>regional</b> <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> the broader areas in which they appear. We centre our case studies on the dual sets of Castilla - Catalonia and Flanders - Wallonia, whereby in Catalonia and Flanders there have developed strong localist movements vis a vis the central states of Spain and Belgium respectively.

Organizado por el Institute of Advanced Research in Business and Economics (INARBE) de la Universidad Pública de Navarra, en colaboración con Glocred y expertos de instituciones de España y Portugal. Celebrado en la Upna el 20 - 21 de abril de 2017. <b>Regional</b> <b>inequality</b> {{in living}} {{standards}} {{is a major}} social problem in {{the very top of}} most of the political agendas worldwide. However, their origins and ultimate causes are far from clear. In this paper we propose a new strategy to measure living standards in the long run based on the Unsatisfied Basic Needs approach (the Historical UBN – HUBN). Using data on education and housing from census and Statistical Yearbooks {{from the end of the}} 19 th and beginning of the 20 th century we present a description of population’s standards of living in Argentina and Spain (with some notes to Uruguay) with an unprecedented high level of spatial disaggregation. The first finding of this paper is that the correlation among the different dimension of our HUBN and between the HUBN and other contemporaneous variables linked with standards of living (like average incomes or inequality) are usually the expected ones suggesting that the HUBN is capturing relatively well some dimension of poverty levels. The second finding of the paper is that the geographic distribution of the standards of living one hundred years ago is remarkably similar to the one dominant nowadays. This very high levels of persistence suggests that <b>regional</b> <b>inequality</b> <b>of</b> standards of living is extremely resilient to policy interventions and reinforces the hypotheses related with geographic determinants and/or strong levels of path dependence...|$|R
40|$|Este artigo examina a evolução do crescimento econômico, em termos de divergência e convergência, das desigualdades regionais da renda {{per capita}} no Brasil, no período entre 1939 e 2006. Inicialmente, analisam-se as teorias do crescimento econômico divergente e convergente. Posteriormente, investiga-se a evolução do crescimento da economia brasileira, a partir de diversos estudos realizados nas últimas décadas, à luz dessas teorias. A análise demonstra que, no início, predominou a concentração econômica no país, e nas fases atuais, prevaleceu a dispersão do crescimento. Abstract This article {{examines}} the evolution of economic growth in Brazil, regarding divergence and convergence <b>of</b> the <b>regional</b> <b>inequalities</b> <b>of</b> the per capita income in the country between 1939 and 2006. Initially, it analyzes some theories about divergent and convergent economic growth. Later, it explores {{the evolution of the}} Brazilian economic growth, during the last decades, according to those theories. The analysis shows that, {{in the beginning of the}} period, there was a highly concentrated pattern of growth in the country, but, lately, it has turned into a scattered economic growth. </div...|$|R
