50|$|A second reason, in {{receivers}} {{that can}} be <b>tuned</b> to different <b>frequencies,</b> is to convert the various different frequencies of the stations to a common frequency for processing. It is difficult to build multistage amplifiers, filters, and detectors that can have all stages track in <b>tuning</b> different <b>frequencies,</b> but it is comparatively easy to build tunable oscillators. Superheterodyne <b>receivers</b> <b>tune</b> in different <b>frequencies</b> by adjusting {{the frequency of the}} local oscillator on the input stage, and all processing after that is done at the same fixed frequency, the IF. Without using an IF, all the complicated filters and detectors in a radio or television would have to be tuned in unison each time the frequency was changed, as was necessary in the early <b>tuned</b> radio <b>frequency</b> <b>receivers.</b> A more important advantage is that it gives the receiver a constant bandwidth over its tuning range. The bandwidth of a filter is proportional to its center frequency. In receivers like the TRF in which the filtering is done at the incoming RF frequency, as the <b>receiver</b> is <b>tuned</b> to higher <b>frequencies</b> its bandwidth increases.|$|R

The unavailability of ground-truth datasets makes this evaluation on real music recordings less trivial than it may initially appear.

40|$|In this {{document}} {{a new approach}} on <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation based on circular statistics is presented. Two methods are introduced: the calculation of the <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> over an entire audio piece, and the estimation of an adapting reference frequency for a single voice. The results for the <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> estimation look very good for audio pieces where the dominant voices are tuned close to the equal-temperament scale and exhibit only moderate frequency dynamics. For the analysis of popular western music, the method does not achieve very robust results due to the strong frequency dynamics of the human singing voice. Nevertheless, the method could be improved by excluding the singing voice from the calculation taking only the accompaniment into account. The main advantage of the proposed method lies especially in the easy computation of an adaptive reference frequency using an exponential moving average. This adaptive reference can for example {{be used in the}} quantization of the singing voice into a note representation. ...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand for high performance RF front-end modules, like multimedia handset and base station devices accommodating multiple wireless standards (2 G, 2. 5 G, 3 G, WiMAX, and LTE). Multiple IF amplifiers, mixers, RF band pass filters (BPFs), modulators and demodulators are desired to be tunable to meet dynamic standards with different frequency bands. Tunable devices with wide <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> range, <b>tuning</b> speed, high linearity, energy conservative, high pass band gain, high stop band rejection are the paramount components in the reconfigurable RF front-end systems. In this dissertation, first a wide tuning passive inductor band pass filter (BPF) with steep roll-off high rejection and low noise figure is presented. The design feature of steep roll-off high stopband rejection (3 ̆e 20 dB) and low noise figure (3 ̆c 6 dB) provides a wide <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> span (1 - 2. 04 GHz) to accept desirable signals and reject close interfering signals. Next, a process variation aware design approach is proposed to verify robustness of the BPF after calibration from process variations. By operating in 1. 04 GHz <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> span the BPF achieves a stable center frequency, an average maximum deviation 1. 16 dB on a nominal pass band gain of 55. 6 dB, and an average maximum deviation 1. 06 MHz on a nominal bandwidth of 12. 3 MHz. Next, a high inductance high Q factor floating CMOS RF active inductor (AI) is proposed, which uses a resistive feedback and a negative resistance block. By changing design parameters, an active inductor designed in 1. 8 V 180 nanometer CMOS process achieves a tuning inductance range from 52 nH to 1, 462 nH at 1. 52 GHz and a maximum Q factor of 553 k at 1. 27 GHz. Its wide tunable frequency span can be increased to 3. 09 GHz. Its power is below 7. 59 mW. Next, a AI driven BPF is proposed, which increases the BPF <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> span from the original 1. 04 GHz (1. 0 - 2. 04 GHz) to 2. 1 GHz (1. 0 - 3. 1 GHz) while keeps a pass band gain (21. 1 28. 2 dB). The AI driven BPF achieves a low noise figure (1. 81 5. 42 dB), a power consumption of 18. 6 mW, and a high stopband rejection of 28. 9 dB. The AI driven BPF <b>tuning</b> <b>frequency</b> span can be further increased to 7. 74 GHz (0. 39 - 8. 13 GHz) with a pass band gain of 8. 14 dB. Finally, a wide tuning inductorless BPF is proposed.
