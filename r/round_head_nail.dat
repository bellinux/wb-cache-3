50|$|Nail guns use {{fasteners}} {{mounted in}} long strips (similar to {{a stick of}} staples) or collated in a paper or plastic carrier, depending {{on the design of}} the nailgun. Some full <b>head</b> <b>nail</b> guns, especially those used for pallet making and roofing, use long plastic or wire collated coils. Some strip nailers use a clipped <b>head</b> so the <b>nails</b> can be closer together, which allows less frequent reloading. Clip <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> are sometimes banned by state or local building codes. Full <b>Round</b> <b>Head</b> <b>nails</b> and ring shank nails provide greater resistance to pull out. Nailers may also be of the 'coil' type where the fasteners come in wire or plastic collation; the advantage is many more fasteners per load, but at the expense of extra weight. Industrial nailers designed for use against steel or concrete may have a self-loading action for the explosive caps, but most need nails to be loaded by hand. Nail guns vary in the length and gauge (thickness) of nails they can drive.|$|R

5000|$|The largest {{sizes of}} {{conventional}} collated fastenings are the clipped head and full <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> {{which are used}} in framing, fencing {{and other forms of}} structural and exterior work. These nails generally have a shank diameter of 0.11 to 0.13 in. (2.9 to 3.1 mm) although some manufacturers offer smaller diameter nails as well. General lengths are in the range 2 in to [...] in (50 to 90 mm). Shank styles include plain, ring annular, twisted, etc. and a variety of materials and finishes are offered including plain steel, galvanized steel, sherardised steel, stainless steel, etc. depending on the pull-out resistance, corrosion resistance, etc. required for the given application. These sizes of fastenings are available in stick collated form (often 20° to 21° for full head, 28° to 34° for clipped head) or coil form (for use in pallet/roofing nailers) depending on the application. Full-head nails have greater pull-out resistance than clipped <b>head</b> <b>nails</b> and are mandated by code in many hurricane zones for structural framing.|$|R
