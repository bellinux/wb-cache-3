50|$|Originally {{boots were}} cut low, {{just over the}} ankle, and soft laterally, both of which limited the amount of {{sideways}} <b>rotating</b> <b>force</b> that could be applied. Around 1966, two new ski boots made of plastic came to market. Compared to leather designs, the Rosemount and Lange boots dramatically increased the amount of lateral stiffness, and in turn, the amount of edging control over the ski. Additionally, the plastic did not change shape over time or when it got wet. This allowed the bindings {{to be much more}} closely matched to the fit of the boot, and offer dramatically improved performance.|$|E
50|$|Commutators {{are used}} in direct current (DC) machines: dynamos (DC generators) and many DC motors as well as {{universal}} motors. In a motor the commutator applies electric current to the windings. By reversing the current direction in the rotating windings each half turn, a steady <b>rotating</b> <b>force</b> (torque) is produced. In a generator the commutator picks off the current generated in the windings, reversing {{the direction of the}} current with each half turn, serving as a mechanical rectifier to convert the alternating current from the windings to unidirectional direct current in the external load circuit. The first direct current commutator-type machine, the dynamo, was built by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832, based on a suggestion by André-Marie Ampère.|$|E
5000|$|A spiral {{fracture}} (a.k.a. torsion fracture) is a bone fracture occurring when torque (a <b>rotating</b> <b>force)</b> is applied along {{the axis of}} a bone. Spiral fractures often occur when the body is in motion while one extremity is planted. For example, a {{spiral fracture}} of the tibia, a bone in the lower leg, can occur in young children when they fall short on an extended leg while jumping. This occurrence is known as [...] "toddler's fracture." [...] Spiral fractures are also recognized as being suspicious in very young children since to obtain a fracture of this sort requires forceful twisting or jerking of the limbs. Child abuse (physical abuse) and certain conditions such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) are considered differentials when identifying spiral or torsion fractures.|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{creation}} of vortex states in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate by a <b>rotating</b> <b>force.</b> For a harmonic trapping potential the <b>rotating</b> <b>force</b> induces only a circular motion of the whole condensate around the trap center which {{does not depend on}} the interatomic interaction.

The efficiency of the creation can be greatly enhanced by a sinusodial variation of the force's angular velocity. We present analytical and numerical calculations for the case of a quartic trapping potential. The physical mechanism behind the requirement of an anharmonic trapping potential for the creation of pure vortex states is explained.

40|$|We {{consider}} the systematic force on a heavy probe induced by interaction with an overdamped diffusive medium where particles undergo a <b>rotating</b> <b>force</b> around a fixed center. The stiffness matrix summarizes {{the stability of}} the probe around that center, where the induced force vanishes. We prove that the introduction of the rotational force in general enhances the stability of that point (and may turn it from unstable to stable!), starting at second-order in the nonequilibrium amplitude. When the driving is further enhanced the stabilization occurs {{for a wide range of}} rotation profiles and the induced stiffness converges to a universal expression proportional to the average mechanical stiffness. The model thus provides a rigorous example of stabilization of a fixed point due to contact with a nonequilibrium medium and beyond linear order around equilibrium. Comment: 32 page...|$|E

This magnetic field is scalable by increasing the number of turns on the coils, by reducing the dimensions of the coils and by increasing the discharge current/voltage of the capacitors.

40|$|Fluctuating {{pressure}} {{data from}} water flow testing of an unshrouded two blade inducer revealed a cavitation induced oscillation {{with the potential}} to induce a radial load on the turbopump shaft in addition to other more traditionally analyzed radial loads. Subsequent water flow testing of the inducer with a <b>rotating</b> <b>force</b> measurement system confirmed that the cavitation induced oscillation did impart a radial load to the inducer. After quantifying the load in a baseline configuration, two inducer shroud treatments were selected and tested to reduce the cavitation induced load. The first treatment was to increase the tip clearance, and the second was to introduce a circumferential groove near the inducer leading edge. Increasing the clearance resulted in a small decrease in radial load along with some steady performance degradation. The groove greatly reduced the hydrodynamic load with little to no steady performance loss. The groove did however generate some new, relatively high frequency, spatially complex oscillations to the flow environment...|$|E

This paper introduces an innovative {{version of a}} variable-speed wind turbine based on a model predictive control (MPC) approach. The proposed approach provides {{maximum power point tracking}} (MPPT), whose main objective is to capture the maximum wind energy in spite of the variable nature of the wind’s speed. The proposed MPC approach also reduces the constraints of the two main functional parts of the wind turbine: the full load and partial load segments. The pitch angle for full load and the <b>rotating</b> <b>force</b> for the partial load have been fixed concurrently in order to balance power generation as well as to reduce the operations of the pitch angle.
