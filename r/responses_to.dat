40|$|Whether {{the results}} of some drug studies {{could be used to}} predict {{the results of}} other drug studies was {{examined}} during serial electrophysiologic drug testing in patients with sustained atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia. The drugs studied were intravenous propranolol, 0. 1 mg/kg; intravenous ouabain, 0. 01 mg/kg; the combination of propranolol plus ouabain; intravenous procainamide, 0. 75 to 1. 5 g; oral quinidine, 1. 2 to 2. 4 g/day; and oral disopyramide, 0. 8 to 1. 6 g/day. <b>Response</b> was inability <b>to</b> induce sustained tachycardia after administration of a drug. <b>Responses</b> due <b>to</b> increased anterograde limb refractoriness. Six of 10 patients with <b>response</b> <b>to</b> propranolol plus ouabain versus 0 of 9 patients without <b>response</b> <b>to</b> this combination had <b>response</b> <b>to</b> propranolol alone (p < 0. 01).

40|$|The chemoreceptors {{responsible}} for the repellent response of Escherichia coli to phenol were investigated. In the absence of all four known methyl-accepting chemoreceptors (Tar, Tsr, Trg, and Tap), cells showed no <b>response</b> <b>to</b> phenol. However, when Trg, which mediates the attractant <b>response</b> <b>to</b> ribose and galactose, was introduced via a plasmid, the cells acquired a repellent <b>response</b> <b>to</b> phenol. About 1 mM phenol induced a clear repellent response; this response was suppressed by 1 mM ribose. Thus, Trg mediates the repellent <b>response</b> <b>to</b> phenol. Mutant Trg proteins with altered sensing for ribose and galactose showed a normal <b>response</b> <b>to</b> phenol, indicating that the interaction site for phenol differs from that for the ribose- and galactose-binding proteins. Tap, which mediates the attractant <b>response</b> <b>to</b> dipeptides, mediated a weaker repellent <b>response</b> <b>to</b> phenol. Tsr, which mediates the attractant <b>response</b> <b>to</b> serine, mediated an even weaker <b>response</b> <b>to</b> phenol. Trg and Tap were also found to function as intracellular pH sensors. Upon a pH decrease, Trg mediated an attractant response, whereas Tap mediated a repellent response.

40|$|Chickadees produce many vocalizations, {{including}} chick-a-dee calls {{which they}} {{use as a}} mobbing call {{in the presence of}} predators. Previous research has shown that chickadees produce more D notes in their mobbing calls in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> high-threat predators compared to low-threat predators, and may perceive predator and corresponding mobbing vocalizations as similar. We presented black-capped chickadees with playback of high- and low-threat predator calls and conspecific mobbing calls, and non-threat heterospecific and reversed mobbing calls, to examine vocal and movement behavioural responses. Chickadees produced more chick-a-dee calls in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> playback of calls produced by a high-threat predator compared to calls produced by a low-threat predator, and to reversed high-threat mobbing calls compared to normal (i. e., non-reversed) high-threat mobbing calls. Chickadees also vocalized more in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> all playback conditions consisting of conspecific mobbing calls compared to a silent baseline period. The number of D notes that the subjects produced was similar to previous findings; chickadees produced approximately one to three D notes per call in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> low-threat mobbing calls, and produced more calls containing four to five D notes in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> high-threat mobbing calls, although this difference in the number of D notes per call was not significant. The difference in chickadees’ production of tseet calls across playback conditions approached significance as chickadees called more in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> conspecific mobbing calls, but not in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> heterospecific calls. General movement activity decreased in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> playback of conspecific-produced vocalizations, but increased in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> heterospecific-produced vocalizations, suggesting that chickadees may mobilize more in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> predator playback in preparation for a “fight or flight” situation. These results also suggest that chickadees may produce more mobbing calls in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> high-threat predator vocalizations as an attempt to initiate mobbing with conspecifics, while they produce fewer mobbing calls in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> a low-threat predator that a chickadee could outmaneuver...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Evidence {{suggests}} {{a reversal of}} the normal left-lateralised <b>response</b> <b>to</b> speech in schizophrenia. AIMS: To test the brain's <b>response</b> <b>to</b> emotional prosody in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. METHOD: BOLD contrast functional magnetic resonance imaging of subjects while they passively listened or attended to sentences that differed in emotional prosody. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia exhibited normal right-lateralisation of the passive <b>response</b> <b>to</b> 'pure' emotional prosody and relative left-lateralisation of the <b>response</b> <b>to</b> unfiltered emotional prosody. When attending to emotional prosody, patients with schizophrenia activated the left insula more than healthy controls. When listening passively, patients with bipolar disorder demonstrated less activation of the bilateral superior temporal gyri in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> pure emotional prosody, and greater activation of the left superior temporal gyrus in <b>response</b> <b>to</b> unfiltered emotional prosody. In both passive experiments, the patient groups activated different lateral temporal lobe regions.
