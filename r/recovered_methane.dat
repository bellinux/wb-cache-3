Quality aspects of historic surveys on deposited wastes are considered and compared over time. Plant specific data on <b>recovered</b> <b>methane</b> gas from landfills have been scanned into a database, {{which has been}} used as a tool for quality control. Despite of some minor differences, the historic quantities of deposited wastes seem to be consistently estimated. There seem to be no systematic differences between the surveys with data on deposited waste amounts, but the variability in the earliest surveys is probably greater. Data on <b>recovered</b> <b>methane</b> are accurate in general, since they mainly depend on sold energy; information that is well documented at the plants. Some unexplained deviations are however identified, when comparing the plant specific values over time. In some cases, it may be possible to increase the quality of the data by renewed contacts with the respondents. Much data were however collected some years back in time, which probably will make a systematic revision of the data unrealistic. A revision of a few values would probably only have minor impacts on the total amount of <b>recovered</b> <b>methane.</b> In the future, the quality of data input could be improved, by immediate consistency checks with older data.

No other economic values of the geopressured brines were considered for exploitation.

(1) An estimate of the reservoir parameters of the geopressured aquifers; their areal extent, net thickness of productive sand, porosity, permeability, effective compressibility. It is these parameters which determine the production rates and the total recovery of the resource that may be expected within an economic time frame.

Liquid saturated with pure methane or a binary methane and carbon dioxide mixture was introduced into the shell side of the extraction unit, whilst sweep gas or vacuum was employed counter-currently as a stripping medium. From data analysis of operation in both anaerobic effluents obtained from Expanded Granular Sludge Blanket (EGSB) reactor and synthetic liquids, when operating under optimum conditions 93 % of methane and 88 % of carbon dioxide was recovered. The obtained data indicate that the extraction process is controlled by diffusivity of gases through the PDMS membrane and {{is proportional to the}} thickness of membrane wall. When applying vacuum to promote methane mass transfer, the process was highly sensitive to vacuum pressure; the highest de-gassing efficiency was recorded under the lowest absolute vacuum pressure. However, when vacuum was replaced by sweep gas, the process was insensitive to changes in gas velocity. When utilising PDMS membrane contactor for de-gassing of EGSB effluent, the net electrical output achieved by the EGSB increased by c. 24 % and indicates that by integrating methane recovery, treatment of domestic wastewater using low temperature EGSB processes can become carbon positive.

More cost-effective and easily managed manure management techniques are still needed to encourage farmers to use animal manure for conversion into energy and nutrients, especially for smaller farms. AD benefits farmers monetarily and mitigates possible manure pollution problems, thereby sustaining development while maintaining environmental quality.

40|$|An {{attractive}} alternative of sequestering CO{sub 2 } is {{to inject}} it into coalbed methane reservoirs, particularly {{since it has}} been shown to enhance the production of methane during near depletion stages. The basis for enhanced coalbed methane recovery and simultaneous sequestration of carbon dioxide in deep coals is the preferential sorption property of coal, with its affinity for carbon dioxide being significantly higher than that for methane. Yet, the sorption behavior of coal under competitive sorptive environment is not fully understood. Hence, the original objective of this research study was to carry out a laboratory study to investigate the effect of studying the sorption behavior of coal in the presence of multiple gases, primarily methane, CO{sub 2 } and nitrogen, {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms involved in displacement of methane and its movement in coal. This had to be modified slightly since the PVT property of gas mixtures is still not well understood, and any laboratory work in the area of sorption of gases requires a definite equation of state to calculate the volumes of different gases in free and adsorbed forms. This research study started with establishing gas adsorption isotherms for pure methane and CO{sub 2 }. The standard gas expansion technique based on volumetric analysis was used for the experimental work with the additional feature of incorporating a gas chromatograph for analysis of gas composition. The results were analyzed first using the Langmuir theory. As expected, the Langmuir analysis indicated that CO{sub 2 } is more than three times as sorptive as methane. This was followed by carrying out a partial desorption isotherm for methane, and then injecting CO{sub 2 } to displace methane. The results indicated that CO{sub 2 } injection at low pressure displaced all of the sorbed methane, even when the total pressure continued to be high. However, the displacement appeared to be occurring due to a combination of the preferential sorption property of coal and reduction in the partial pressure of methane. As a final step, the Extended Langmuir (EL) model was used to model the coal-methane-CO{sub 2 } binary adsorption system. The EL model was found to be very accurate in predicting adsorption of CO{sub 2 }, but not so in predicting desorption of methane. The selectivity of CO{sub 2 } over methane was calculated to be 4. 3 : 1. This is, of course, not in very good agreement with the measured values which showed the ratio to be 3. 5 : 1. However, the measured results are in good agreement with the field observation at one of the CO{sub 2 } injection sites. Based on the findings of this study, it was concluded that low pressure injection of CO{sub 2 } can be fairly effective in displacing methane in coalbed reservoirs although this might be difficult to achieve in field conditions. Furthermore, the displacement of methane appears to be not only due to the preferential sorption of methane, but reduction in partial pressure as well. Hence, using a highly adsorbing gas, such as CO{sub 2 }, has the advantages of inert gas stripping and non-mixing since the injected gas does not mix with the <b>recovered</b> <b>methane...</b>|$|E

Nonetheless, at high solid loadings (i. e. TS level >  10 %), the digestion performance was affected by chemical inhibition due to ammonia and/or humic acid. Thermophilic temperatures did not influence digestion performance but did increase start-up failure risk. Further, inoculation of residues from the batch digestion to subsequent batch enhanced start-up and achieved full methane potential recovery of the bedding. Inoculation with liquid residue (leachate) was preferred over a solid residue, to preserve treatment capacity for fresh substrate. Overall, the study highlighted that indigenous microbial community in the solid manure residue was capable of <b>recovering</b> full <b>methane</b> potential and that solid-phase digestion was ultimately limited by chemical inhibition rather than lack of suitable microbial community...|$|R
40|$|Demand for {{hydrocarbon}} fuels {{is steadily}} increasing, and {{greenhouse gas emissions}} continue to rise unabated with the energy demand. Alternate fuels will be coming on line to meet that demand. This report examines the <b>recovering</b> of <b>methane</b> from methane hydrates for fuel to meet this demand rather than permitting its natural release into the environment, which will be detrimental to the planet. Some background on the nature, vast sizes, and stability of sedimentary and permafrost formations of hydrates are discussed. A few examples of the severe problems associated with methane recovery from these hydrates are presented along with the potential {{impact on the environment}} and coastal waters. Future availability of methane from hydrates may become an attractive option for aviation fueling, and so future aircraft design associated with methane fueling is considered...|$|R
