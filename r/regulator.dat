5|$|Single {{cylinder}} with dual regulators {{consists of}} a single large back mounted cylinder, with two first-stage regulators, each with a second-stage <b>regulator.</b> This system is used for diving where cold water makes the risk of <b>regulator</b> freezing high and functional redundancy is required. It is common in continental Europe, especially Germany. The advantage is that a <b>regulator</b> failure can be solved underwater to bring the dive to a controlled conclusion without buddy breathing or gas sharing. However, {{it is hard to}} reach the valves, so there may be some reliance on the dive buddy to help close the valve of the free-flowing <b>regulator</b> quickly.|$|E
5|$|This formula neglects the {{cracking}} pressure required to open both {{first and second}} stages of the <b>regulator,</b> and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the <b>regulator,</b> {{both of which are}} variable depending on the design and adjustment of the <b>regulator,</b> and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.|$|E

40|$|In {{adolescents}} {{who had experienced}} at least one stressful life event, it was studied if cognitive emotion regulation strategies could form distinct profiles, and whether these profiles were differentially associated with depressive symptoms. A total of 420 adolescents participated, including 342 typical and 78 clinically depressed adolescents. Data was collected in The Netherlands. A person-centered approach with Latent Profile Analysis was used, to identify underlying profiles of cognitive emotion regulation, based on the adolescents’ reports of their use of cognitive emotion regulation strategies when they were confronted with stressful life events. Nine different strategies, five purportedly adaptive and four maladaptive, were used as indicators. Four distinct profiles of cognitive emotion regulation strategies with distinct features were found: Low <b>Regulators</b> (n = 36), High <b>Regulators</b> (n = 174), Adaptive <b>Regulators</b> (n = 126) and Maladaptive <b>Regulators</b> (n = 84). Maladaptive <b>Regulators</b> endorsed higher levels of depressive symptoms, relative to Low, High and Adaptive <b>Regulators.</b> Clinically depressed adolescents made use of all profiles, but the Maladaptive <b>Regulators</b> profile was used most. Age differences showed that Low <b>Regulators</b> were younger than High <b>Regulators</b> and Adaptive <b>Regulators.</b> Maladaptive <b>Regulators</b> were younger than High <b>Regulators.</b> The findings underscore the utility of using a person-centered approach {{in order to identify}} patterns of cognitive emotion regulation deficits in psychopathology...|$|R

5|$|A-clamp or yoke {{connectors}} - {{the connection}} on the <b>regulator</b> surrounds the valve pillar and presses the output O-ring of the pillar valve against the input {{seat of the}} <b>regulator.</b> The connection is officially described as connection CGA850 yoke. The yoke is screwed down snug by hand (overtightening can make the yoke impossible to remove later without tools) and the seal is created by clamping the O-ring between the surfaces of the <b>regulator</b> and valve. When the valve is opened, cylinder pressure expands the O-ring against the outer surface of the O-ring groove in the valve. Insufficient clamping force may allow the pressure to extrude the O-ring between the valve and <b>regulator</b> faces, resulting in a leak. This type of connection is simple, cheap and very widely used worldwide. It has a maximum pressure rating of 232 bar and the weakest part of the seal, the O-ring, is not well protected from overpressurisation.|$|E
5|$|Also {{known as}} a {{manifold}} cage or <b>regulator</b> cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to {{the neck of the}} cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and <b>regulator</b> first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.|$|E

5|$|DIN {{screw thread}} {{connectors}} - the <b>regulator</b> screws into the cylinder valve trapping the O-ring securely between the sealing {{face of the}} valve and the O-ring groove in the <b>regulator.</b> These are more reliable than A-clamps because the O-ring is well protected, but many countries do not use DIN fittings widely on compressors, or cylinders which have DIN fittings, so a diver traveling abroad with a DIN system may need to take an adaptor, either for connecting the DIN <b>regulator</b> to a rented cylinder, or for connecting an A-clamp filler hose to a DIN cylinder valve.|$|E
5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a <b>regulator.</b> This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a <b>regulator</b> to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning <b>regulator</b> on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the <b>regulator</b> on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a <b>regulator.</b> These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.|$|E

40|$|LAL <b>regulators</b> (Large ATP-binding <b>regulators</b> of the LuxR family) {{constitute}} a poorly studied family of transcriptional <b>regulators.</b> Several <b>regulators</b> of this class {{have been identified}} in antibiotic and other secondary metabolite gene clusters from actinomycetes, thus they have been considered pathway-specific <b>regulators.</b> In this study we have obtained two disruption mutants of LAL genes from S. coelicolor (D 0877 and D 7173). Both mutants were deficient in the production of the polyketide antibiotic actinorhodin, and antibiotic production was restored upon gene complementation of the mutants. The use of whole-genome DNA microarrays and quantitative PCRs enabled the analysis of the transcriptome of both mutants in comparison with the wild type. Our results indicate that the LAL <b>regulators</b> under study act globally affecting various cellular processes, and amongst them the phosphate starvation response and the biosynthesis of the bluepigmented antibiotic actinorhodin.

40|$|The most {{frequently}} mentioned explanation for product bans is that <b>regulators</b> {{know more about}} product quality than consumers. A problem with this explanation, however, is that such <b>regulators</b> should prefer to just communicate the information implicit in their ban, perhaps via a “would have banned ” label. We show, however, that since product labeling is cheap talk, any small market failure, such as a use-externality, will tempt <b>regulators</b> to lie about quality. If consumers suspect such lies, <b>regulators</b> can not communicate their ban information, and so will ban instead. We also show that when <b>regulators</b> expect market failures to lead to underconsumption of a product, and so would not ban it for informed consumers, <b>regulators</b> should want to commit to not banning this product for uninformed consumers...|$|R
40|$|Regulation and {{consumer}} class actions can complement, duplicate, or oppose each other, depending, among others, on the leanings of regulatory objective functions towards the industry or consumers.

5|$|Open circuit scuba divers by {{definition}} {{are independent of}} surface supply, and must take any gas mixture with them {{that is to be}} used on the dive. However, if they are confident of returning by a specific route, the decompression gas may be stored at appropriate places on that route. The cylinders used for this purpose are called stage cylinders, and they are usually provided with a standard <b>regulator</b> and a submersible pressure gauge, and are usually left at the stop with the <b>regulator</b> pressurized, but the cylinder valve turned off to minimize the risk of gas loss. Similar cylinders are carried by the divers when the route back is not secure. They are commonly mounted as sling cylinders, clipped to D-rings at the sides of the diver's harness.|$|E
