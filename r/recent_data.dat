5|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer has {{classified}} cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although {{occupational exposure}} to cadmium {{is linked to}} lung and prostate cancer, {{there is still a}} substantial controversy about the carcinogenicity of cadmium in low environmental exposure. <b>Recent</b> <b>data</b> from epidemiological studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of endometrial, breast and prostate cancer as well as to osteoporosis in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that endometrial tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females.|$|E

The FCW_MRFI algorithm can mine frequent item in any window of <b>recent</b> streaming <b>data,</b> whose given length is L. Meanwhile, it divides <b>recent</b> streaming <b>data</b> into several windows of variable length according to m, which {{is the number of}} the counter array. This algorithm can achieve smaller query error in recent windows, and can minimize the maximum query error in the whole <b>recent</b> streaming <b>data.</b> I...|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the antipyretic action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More <b>recent</b> <b>data</b> also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
