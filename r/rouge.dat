5|$|After the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> {{regime was}} overthrown, a new Cambodian {{government}} supported by Vietnam, the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established. The Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, {{was unhappy with}} Vietnam's influence over the PRK government. Deng proposed to Sihanouk that he co-operate with the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> to overthrow the PRK government, but rejected it, as he opposed the genocidal policies pursued by the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> {{while they were in}} power. In March 1981 Sihanouk established a resistance movement, FUNCINPEC which was complemented by a small resistance army known as Armée Nationale Sihanoukiste (ANS). He appointed In Tam, who had briefly served as Prime Minister in the Khmer Republic, as the commander-in-chief of ANS. The ANS needed military aid from China, and Deng seized the opportunity to sway Sihanouk into collaborating with the Khmer <b>Rouge.</b> Sihanouk reluctantly agreed, and started talks in March 1981 with the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> and the Son Sann-led Khmer People's National Liberation Front (KPNLF) on a unified anti-PRK resistance movement.|$|E
5|$|Also {{hidden from}} {{scrutiny}} was the growing antagonism between the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> and their North Vietnamese allies. The radical {{leadership of the}} party could never escape the suspicion that Hanoi had designs on building an Indochinese federation with the North Vietnamese as its master. The Khmer <b>Rouge</b> were ideologically tied to the Chinese, while North Vietnam's chief supporters, the Soviet Union, still recognized the Lon Nol government as legitimate. After {{the signing of the}} Paris Peace Accords, PAVN cut off the supply of arms to the Khmer <b>Rouge,</b> hoping to force them into a cease-fire. When the Americans were freed by the signing of the accords to turn their air power completely on the Khmer <b>Rouge,</b> this too was blamed on Hanoi. During the year, these suspicions and attitudes led the party leadership to carry out purges within their ranks. Most of the Hanoi-trained members were then executed on the orders of Pol Pot.|$|E
5|$|As the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> had no {{air force}} and only limited {{anti-aircraft}} capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low-reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers.|$|E

5|$|During the Vietnam War, Vietnamese and Khmer <b>Rouge</b> communists {{had formed}} an {{alliance}} to fight U.S.-backed regimes {{in their respective}} countries. Despite their open display of cooperation with the Vietnamese, the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> leadership feared that the Vietnamese communists were scheming to form an Indochinese federation with Vietnam as the dominant force in the region. In order to pre-empt {{an attempt by the}} Vietnamese to dominate them, the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> leadership began purging Vietnamese-trained personnel within their own ranks as the Lon Nol regime capitulated in 1975. Then, in May 1975, the newly formed Democratic Kampuchea, dominated by the Khmer <b>Rouge,</b> began attacking Vietnam, beginning with an attack on the Vietnamese island of Phú Quốc. In spite of the fighting, the leaders of reunified Vietnam and Kampuchea made several public diplomatic exchanges throughout 1976 to highlight the supposedly strong relations between them. However, behind the scenes, Kampuchean leaders continued to fear what they perceived as Vietnamese expansionism. As such, on 30 April 1977, they launched another major military attack on Vietnam. Shocked by the Kampuchean assault, Vietnam launched a retaliatory strike at the end of 1977 in an attempt to force the Kampuchean government to negotiate. In January 1978, the Vietnamese military withdrew because their political objectives had not been achieved—the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> remained unwilling to seriously negotiate.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} Vietnam War ended, the {{relationship}} between the Khmer Rouge—which {{was in the process of}} seizing power from a US-backed regime headed by Lon Nol—and North Vietnam was strained. Clashes between Vietnamese communists and Khmer <b>Rouge</b> forces began as early as 1974, and the following year Pol Pot signed a treaty codifying the ‘friendship’ between the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> and China.|$|E

5|$|In March 1992, {{the start}} of the UNTAC mission in Cambodia was marked by the arrival of 22,000 UN peacekeepers, which {{included}} troops from 22 countries, 6,000 officials, 3,500 police and 1,700 civilian employees and electoral volunteers. The mission was led by Yasushi Akashi. In June 1992, the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> formally established the National Union Party of Kampuchea, and announced that it would not register to participate in the upcoming elections. Furthermore, the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> also refused to disarm its forces in accordance with the Paris agreement. Then, to prevent ethnic Vietnamese from taking part in the elections, the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> started massacring Vietnamese civilian communities, causing hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese to flee Cambodia. Towards the end of 1992, Khmer <b>Rouge</b> forces advanced into Kampong Thom in order to gain a strategic foothold, before UN peacekeeping forces were fully deployed there. In {{the months leading up to}} the elections, several UN military patrols were attacked as they entered Khmer Rouge-held territory.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of the Vietnamese occupation, the Kampuchean {{resistance}} groups had limited contact with each other due to their differences. Even though the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> enjoyed widespread international recognition, by 1980 the organization was under pressure to reform itself from the international community. ASEAN, which had backed the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> throughout their diplomatic confrontations with the PRK regime at the UN General Assembly in 1979, urged the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> leadership to put its blood-stained image behind it in order to join forces with other non-communist movements. However, the idea of forming an alliance with the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> initially caused a certain degree of uneasiness within the leadership circles of the FUNCINPEC and the KPNLF, because both groups were leery about joining with a communist organization well known for its brutality. Nonetheless, early in 1981, Sihanouk and Son Sann began engaging in talks with Khieu Samphan, President of the deposed Democratic Kampuchea, to discuss the prospect of forming an alliance.|$|E

5|$|On New Year's Day 1975 the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> {{launched}} their final offensive against {{the forces of}} Lon Nol. Neither the agony of the Cambodian people nor the resignation of Lon Nol could halt or slow the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> advance. By 17 April, Phnom Penh had fallen and the nation slid into darkness. In the new Year Zero, the Khmer <b>Rouge,</b> under the leadership of Pol Pot, began its descent into mass murder and auto-genocide.|$|E

5|$|The Khmer <b>Rouge</b> leadership, {{with much}} of its {{political}} and military structures shattered by the Vietnamese invasion, was forced to take refuge in Thailand, where it was warmly welcomed by the Thai Government. Despite the overwhelming economic challenges brought by the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> and the accompanying refugees, the Thai Government sheltered and protected the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> at Khao Larn camp in Trat Province. Meanwhile, in Phnom Penh, the new Kampuchean regime tried to rebuild the country’s economic and social life, which was largely destroyed by decades of political upheavals and constant warfare. However, efforts to rebuild the country were severely hampered {{by the lack of}} educated and qualified personnel, as most educated people had either fled the country or had been murdered by the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> regime during the previous four years. By the end of the year, the new regime’s attempts at nation-building were further challenged by several anti-Vietnamese resistance groups operating along the western regions of the country.|$|E

5|$|The other non-communist {{organisation}} was the National United Front for an Independent, Peaceful, Neutral, and Cooperative Cambodia, {{formed by}} Sihanouk and {{known by its}} French acronym FUNCINPEC. The organization was formed after Sihanouk had severed ties with the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> following his representation on its behalf at the UN Security Council. As the leader of FUNCINPEC, Sihanouk called on the UN General Assembly to expel Khmer <b>Rouge</b> representatives for their crimes while in power and to keep Kampuchea’s seat at the UN vacant {{on the basis that}} neither the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> nor the Vietnamese-installed PRK had the mandate to represent the Kampuchean people. He also criticised ASEAN for its continued recognition of the Khmer <b>Rouge,</b> and specifically Thailand for enabling Chinese arms shipments to travel through its territory to supply the notorious communist group. Despite the strength, effectiveness and popularity of the KPNLF and the FUNCINPEC, both resistance groups were plagued by internal divisions caused by the lack of unity, leadership struggles, corruption and alleged abuses of human rights.|$|E
5|$|Vietnamese {{migrant workers}} started to arrive from 1992 onwards {{due to the}} {{creation}} of new job opportunities by the UNTAC administration. At the same time, the UNTAC administration allowed the opening of political offices and political parties such as FUNCINPEC and the BLDP began to propagate anti-Vietnamese sentiments among the populace to shore up electorate support in the 1993 general elections. In November 1992, the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> which controlled northwestern parts of Cambodia, passed a resolution to target systematic killings of Vietnamese soldiers and civilians. The first guerrilla-style attacks by the Khmer <b>Rouge</b> on Vietnamese civilians started in December 1992, and Khmer <b>Rouge</b> soldiers justified the killings by claiming that some of the civilians were Vietnamese soldiers in disguise. The spate of killings by Khmer <b>Rouge</b> prompted some 21,000 ethnic Vietnamese to flee to Vietnam in March 1993.|$|E
