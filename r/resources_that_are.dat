5|$|The production-possibility {{frontier}} can {{be constructed}} from the contract curve in an Edgeworth production box diagram of factor intensity. The example used above (which demonstrates increasing opportunity costs, with a curve concave to the origin) {{is the most common}} form of PPF. It represents a disparity, in the factor intensities and technologies of the two production sectors. That is, as an economy specializes more and more into one product (such as moving from point B to point D), the opportunity cost of producing that product increases, because we are using more and more <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> less efficient in producing it. With increasing production of butter, workers from the gun industry will move to it. At first, the least qualified (or most general) gun workers will be transferred into making more butter, and moving these workers has little impact on the opportunity cost of increasing butter production: the loss in gun production will be small. However, the cost of producing successive units of butter will increase as <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> more and more specialized in gun production are moved into the butter industry.|$|E

25|$|Asset {{poverty is}} an {{economic}} and social condition that is more persistent and prevalent than income poverty. It {{can be defined as}} a household's inability to access wealth <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> enough to provide for basic needs for a period of three months. Basic needs refer to the minimum standards for consumption and acceptable needs.Wealth resources consist of home ownership, other real estate (second home, rented properties, etc.), net value of farm and business assets, stocks, checking and savings accounts, and other savings (money in savings bonds, life insurance policy cash values, etc.).Wealth is measured in three forms: net worth, net worth minus home equity, and liquid assets. Net worth consists of all the aspects mentioned above. Net worth minus home equity is the same except it does not include home ownership in asset calculations. Liquid assets are <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> readily available such as cash, checking and savings accounts, stocks, and other sources of savings. There are two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets most closely resemble liquid assets in that they include stocks, bonds, property, natural resources, and hard assets not in the form of real estate. Intangible assets are simply the access to credit, social capital, cultural capital, political capital, and human capital.|$|E

25|$|Underground coal {{gasification}} is an industrial gasification process, which {{is carried out}} in non-mined coal seams using injection of a gaseous oxidizing agent, usually oxygen or air, and bringing the resulting product gas to surface through production wells drilled from the surface.

The technique can be applied to <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> otherwise not economical to extract and also offers an alternative to conventional coal mining methods for some resources. Compared to traditional coal mining and gasification, UCG has less environmental and social impact, though some concerns including potential for aquifer contamination are known.|$|E

25|$|Tin and {{petroleum}} are the {{two main}} mineral <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> of major significance in the Malaysian economy. Malaysia was once the world's largest producer of tin until {{the collapse of the}} tin market in the early 1980s. In the 19th and 20th century, tin played a predominant role in the Malaysian economy, with Malaysia accounting for over 31% of global output. It was only in 1972 that petroleum and natural gas took over from tin as the mainstay of the mineral extraction sector. Other minerals of some importance or significance include copper, bauxite, iron-ore and coal together with industrial minerals like clay, kaolin, silica, limestone, barite, phosphates and dimension stones such as granite as well as marble blocks and slabs. Small quantities of gold are produced.|$|E
25|$|The {{advantages}} of manure treatment are {{a reduction in}} the amount of manure that needs to be transported and applied to crops, as well as reduced soil compaction. Nutrients are reduced as well, meaning that less cropland is needed for manure to be spread upon. Manure treatment can also reduce the risk of human health and biosecurity risks by reducing the amount of pathogens present in manure. Undiluted animal manure or slurry is one hundred times more concentrated than domestic sewage, and can carry an intestinal parasite, Cryptosporidium, which is difficult to detect but can be passed to humans. Silage liquor (from fermented wet grass) is even stronger than slurry, with a low pH and very high biological oxygen demand. With a low pH, silage liquor can be highly corrosive; it can attack synthetic materials, causing damage to storage equipment, and leading to accidental spillage. All of these advantages can be optimized by using the right manure management system on the right farm based on the <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> available.|$|E
25|$|Many {{people of}} sub-Saharan Africa choose to foster their {{children}} to infertile women. IVF enables these infertile women {{to have their own}} children, which imposes new ideals to a culture in which fostering children is seen as both natural and culturally important. Many infertile women are able to earn more respect in their society by taking care of the children of other mothers, and this may be lost if they choose to use IVF instead. As IVF is seen as unnatural, it may even hinder their societal position as opposed to making them equal with fertile women. It is also economically advantageous for infertile women to raise foster children as it gives these children greater ability to access <b>resources</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> important for their development and also aids the development of their society at large. If IVF becomes more popular without the birth rate decreasing, there could be more large family homes with fewer options to send their newborn children. This could result in an increase of orphaned children and/or a decrease in resources for the children of large families. This would ultimately stifle the children's and the community's growth.|$|E
