In particular, in machine learning, the need to set a learning <b>rate</b> (<b>step</b> size) has been recognized as problematic. Setting this parameter too high can cause the algorithm to diverge; setting it too low makes it slow to converge. A conceptually simple extension of stochastic gradient descent makes the learning rate a decreasing function [...] of the iteration number , giving a learning rate schedule, so that the first iterations cause large changes in the parameters, while the later ones do only fine-tuning.

40|$|Abstract: A stylised fact of {{monetary}} policy making is that central banks do not immediately respond to new information but rather seem to prefer {{to wait until}} sufficient ‘evidence’ to warrant a change has accumulated. However, theoretical models of inflation targeting imply that an optimising central bank should continuously respond to shocks. This paper attempts to explain this stylised fact by introducing a small menu cost which is incurred every time the central bank changes the interest rate. It is shown that this produces a relatively large range of inaction because this cost will induce the central bank to take the option value {{of the status quo}} into account. In other words, because action is costly the central bank will have an incentive to wait and see whether or not the economy will move closer to the inflation target of its own accord. Next, the paper analyses the implications for the time series properties of interest rates. In particular, we examine the effect of the interest rate sensitivity of aggregate demand, the slope of the Lucas supply function and the variance of demand shocks {{on the size of the}} interest <b>rate</b> <b>step</b> and the expected length of the time period till the next interest <b>rate</b> <b>step.</b> Finally, we analyse the effect of menu costs on inflationary expectations.

40|$|Rationale. There is a {{need for}} the {{development}} of a field test to evaluate exertional dyspnea in the primary care setting. This study examined the applicability of a 3 -minute constant <b>rate</b> <b>step</b> test in patients with COPD. Methods. This test involved 4 stepping rates (18, 22, 26, 32 steps. min- 1) equivalent to approximately 4. 5, 5. 3, 6. 0, and 7. 2 MET with the ultimate goal that in its final development, the assessment will be made a single stepping rate based on disease severity. Stable COPD patients (N = 43; 65 +/- 6. 5 years; FEV 1 = 49 +/- 16 % pred.; SpO 2 (%) rest: 95 +/- 2) were equipped with a portable Jaeger Oxycon MobileRTM metabolic system and followed an audio signal for stepping up and down a single 20 cm step for 3 minutes. Borg dyspnea scores were obtained at the end each stepping bout. A 10 -min rest was given between each stepping bout. Results. Of the 43 patients, 80 % completed stages 1 and 2, 74 and 37 % stages 3 and 4 while no patient of MRC class 4 or 5 (N = 8) completed stage 1. Breathing frequency (breaths. min- 1) spanned from 26. 5 +/- 4. 1 to 39. 0 +/- 6. 4 but VT (L) remained unchanged (1. 4 +/- 0. 3 vs. 1. 5 +/- 0. 4) from stage 1 to 4 while Borg scores were 3 +/- 1, 4 +/- 1, 5 +/- 2, 6 +/- 3 respectively and SpO 2 (%) were 92 +/- 5, 91 +/- 4, 91 +/- 4 and 90 +/- 4.

Methods: Three-dimensional kinematics and kinetics were recorded from 45 healthy recreational runners during treadmill running at constant speed under various <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> conditions (preferred, ᵥ, and ᱰ%). We tested our primary hypothesis that a reduction in energy absorption by the lower extremity joints during the loading response would occur, primarily at the knee, when <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> was increased. Results: Less mechanical energy was absorbed at the knee (P < 0. 01) during the + 5 % and + 10 % <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> conditions, whereas the hip (P < 0. 01) absorbed less energy during the + 10 % condition only. All joints displayed substantially (P < 0. 01) more energy absorption when preferred <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> was reduced by 10 %. Step length (P < 0. 01), center of mass vertical excursion (P < 0. 01), braking impulse (P < 0. 01), and peak knee flexion angle (P < 0. 01) were observed to decrease with increasing <b>step</b> <b>rate.</b> When <b>step</b> <b>rate</b> was increased 10 % above preferred, peak hip adduction angle (P < 0. 01) and peak hip adduction (P < 0. 01) and internal rotation (P < 0. 01) moments were found to decrease.
