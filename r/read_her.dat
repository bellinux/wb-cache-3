5|$|On October 3, 2008, {{she visited}} Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum where she praised her {{works such as}} Farmer Boy, These Happy Golden Years and The Little House on the Prairie, the last of which she had felt an {{association}} with as a child. During the same Laura Ingalls Wilder's estate visit, {{she said that she}} <b>read</b> <b>her</b> books to her daughters and gave the writer Save America's Treasures grant.|$|E
5|$|Their {{relationship}} was further strained in 1946 when Fontaine made negative comments to an interviewer about deHavilland's new husband, Marcus Goodrich. When she <b>read</b> <b>her</b> sister's remarks, deHavilland was deeply hurt {{and waited for}} an apology that was never offered. The following year after accepting her first Academy Award for To Each His Own, deHavilland was approached backstage by Fontaine, who extended her hand to congratulate her; deHavilland {{turned away from her}} sister. The two did not speak {{for the next five years}} after the incident. This may have caused an estrangement between Fontaine and her own daughters, who maintained a covert relationship with their aunt, deHavilland.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) {{asks for}} Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) help in {{adopting}} a baby, {{as the local}} adoption agency requires a reference letter from an employer. Andy promises to <b>read</b> <b>her</b> application letter, but tells the camera crew he will only sign it if she admits {{that she is a}} horrible person in it. However, Andy is unaware that Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is using her own painful past as a non-adopted orphan to help Nellie with the process. When Andy coldly rejects Nellie's letter (which Erin helped her write), Nellie accepts his decision, but Andy is stunned to hear Erin crying sadly over the failure. He finally adds some mildly snarky but complimentary lines to her letter and signs onto it as a reference, leaving Nellie overjoyed.|$|E

5|$|Snow and the Huntsman walk {{together}} in the forest, and she sees through his disguise and correctly guesses that he was sent by the Queen to kill her. Snow flees, but as the Huntsman catches up with her, he finds her writing a letter, which she requests he deliver to the queen after she is killed. The Huntsman takes out his knife, but instead of killing her, he fashions a whistle out of a bamboo stick, telling her that it will summon help and then telling her to run. The Huntsman then returns to the queen with a deer heart, hoping that she will not know the difference. The queen asks him to <b>read</b> <b>her</b> the letter, which is an apology for past wrongs {{as well as a}} request from Snow that her stepmother rule the kingdom with compassion. The queen burns the letter and takes the box with the heart in it to store in her vault. When she cannot open one of her storage safes, it proves that the Huntsman lied to her; the heart is not human. The Queen has her guards drag him down to the vault and she yanks his glowing heart out of his body. She tells the Huntsman that from now on he will be her pet and will do her bidding forever, and if he ever betrays her, all she has to do is squeeze.|$|E

25|$|While {{waiting in}} the airport, Claire {{complains}} to Cameron about Phil's inability to foresee her needs.

25|$|Tuberculosis {{took hold}} {{and he was}} advised by his doctors {{to move to a}} warmer climate. In September 1820 Keats left for Rome knowing he would {{probably}} never see Brawne again. After leaving he felt unable to write to her or <b>read</b> <b>her</b> letters, although he did correspond with her mother. He died there five months later. None of Brawne's letters to Keats survive.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close {{and listen to what}} she has to say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is struck by the fact that even as we <b>read</b> <b>her</b> final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
25|$|In the end, West's anti-Communism {{remained}} {{the centerpiece of}} her politics because she so consistently challenged the Communists as legitimate foes {{of the status quo}} in capitalist countries. In West's view, Communism, like fascism, was merely a form of authoritarianism. Communists were under party discipline and therefore could never speak for themselves. And West was a supreme example of an intellectual who spoke for herself, no matter how her comments might injure her. Indeed, few writers explicitly acknowledged how much West's embrace of unpopular positions hurt her on the left. A whole generation of writers abandoned West and refused to <b>read</b> <b>her,</b> as Doris Lessing suggested.|$|E

25|$|When Bonham Carter was five, {{her mother}} had a serious nervous breakdown, from which it took her three years to recover. Upon her recovery, her {{experience}} in therapy led her to become a psychotherapist herself – Bonham Carter now pays her to <b>read</b> <b>her</b> scripts and deliver her opinion of the characters' psychological motivations. Five years after her mother's recovery, her father was diagnosed with acoustic neuroma. He suffered complications during an operation to remove the tumour {{which led to a}} stroke that left him half-paralysed and using a wheelchair. With her brothers at college, Bonham Carter was left to help her mother cope. She later studied her father's movements and mannerisms for her role in The Theory of Flight. He died in January 2004.|$|E

However, according to the Polish law, all documents of the political police must be handed in to the state. The administration of the institute notified the prosecutor's office, which conducted a police search of the Kiszczaks' house and seized all the historic documents. Maria Kiszczak later said she had not <b>read</b> <b>her</b> husband’s letter and had [...] "made a mistake".|$|E

500|$|... "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] shared many of {{the themes}} in President Clinton's inaugural address, which he gave {{immediately}} before Angelou <b>read</b> <b>her</b> poem, including change, responsibility, and the President's and the citizenry's role in establishing economic security. The symbols in Angelou's poem (the tree, the river, and the morning, for example) paralleled {{many of the}} same symbols Clinton used in his speech, and helped to enhance and expand Clinton's images. Clinton's address and the poem, according to Hagen, both emphasized unity despite the diversity of American culture. [...] "On the Pulse of Morning" [...] attempted to convey many of the goals of Clinton's new administration.|$|E
