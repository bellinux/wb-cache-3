40|$|<b>Read-across,</b> i. e., filling {{toxicological}} data gaps by relating to similar chemicals for which test data are available, is usually done based on chemical similarity. Besides structure and physico-chemical properties, biological similarity based on biological data adds extra strength to this process. In the simplest case, chemically similar substances also show similar test results in relevant in vitro assays. This is a well-established method for the <b>read-across</b> of, e. g., genotoxicity assays. Larger datasets of biological and toxicological properties of hundreds {{and thousands of}} substances are becoming available, enabling big data approaches in <b>read-across</b> studies. In the context of developing Good <b>Read-Across</b> Practice guidance, a number of case studies using various big data sources were evaluated to assess the contribution of biological data to enriching <b>read-across.</b> An example is given for the US EPA's ToxCast dataset which allows <b>read-across</b> for high quality uterotrophic assays for estrogenic endocrine disruption. Similarly, an example is given for REACH registration data that enhances <b>read-across</b> for acute toxicity studies. A different approach is taken using omics data to establish biological similarity: Examples are given for in vitro stem cell models and short-term in vivo repeated dose studies in rats used to support <b>read-across</b> and category formation. These preliminary biological data-driven <b>read-across</b> studies show the way towards the generation of new <b>read-across</b> approaches that can inform chemical safety assessment.

40|$|Background: Safety {{assessment}} for {{repeated dose toxicity}} {{is one of the}} largest challenges in the process to replace animal testing. This is also one of the proof of concept ambitions of SEURAT- 1, the largest ever European Union research initiative on alternative testing, co-funded by the European Commission and Cosmetics Europe. This review is based on the discussion and outcome of a workshop organized on initiative of the SEURAT- 1 consortium joined by a group of international experts with complementary knowledge to further develop traditional <b>read-across</b> and include new approach data. Objectives: The aim of the suggested strategy for chemical <b>read-across</b> is to show how a traditional <b>read-across</b> based on structural similarities between source and target substance can be strengthened with additional evidence from new approach data—for example, information from in vitro molecular screening, “-omics” assays and computational models—to reach regulatory acceptance. Methods: We identified four <b>read-across</b> scenarios that cover typical human health assessment situations. For each such decision context, we suggested several chemical groups as examples to prove when <b>read-across</b> between group members is possible, considering both chemical and biological similarities. Conclusions: We agreed to carry out the complete <b>read-across</b> exercise for at least one chemical category per <b>read-across</b> scenario in the context of SEURAT- 1, and the results of this exercise will be completed and presented by the end of the research initiative in December 2015...|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, the {{grouping}} of substances and <b>read-across</b> approaches were developed for filling data gaps in registrations of chemicals. <b>Read-across</b> approaches utilize weight-of-evidence approaches {{to make use}} of shared properties of an untested compound to a known compound. While sharing many characteristics of a QSAR, <b>read-across</b> approaches do not seek a mathematical formula for larger parts of the chemical universe but instead are based on “local” similarity and shared properties of chemicals [36, 37]. In addition to the similarity in the structure and physicochemical properties, biological data are also used to compare biological similarity among chemicals in <b>read-across</b> approaches. Good <b>Read-Across</b> Practices (GRAPs) were created and developed by the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation {{as a result of the}} broad use of <b>read-across</b> approaches and the need to establish standards [36, 38]. The GRAP collaboration formed to further this approach and addresses aspects such as regulatory acceptability, the use of biological support data [37], and the applicability to nanomaterials or complex mixtures. The major advantage is that such an approach can actually be formally validated and uncertainties with any prediction can be quantified. The emergence of professional tools and services promises a much broader use of computational approaches both for REACH registration and other similar legislations worldwide, as well as for Green Toxicology practices.|$|E

40|$|Physicochemical {{properties}} of chemicals affect their exposure, toxicokinetics/fate and hazard, and for nanomaterials, the variation of these properties {{results in a}} wide variety of materials with potentially different risks. To limit the amount of testing for risk assessment, the information gathering process for nanomaterials needs to be efficient. At the same time, sufficient information to assess the safety of human health and the environment should be available for each nanomaterial. Grouping and <b>read-across</b> approaches can be utilised to meet these goals. This article presents different possible applications of grouping and <b>read-across</b> for nanomaterials within the broader perspective of the MARINA Risk Assessment Strategy (RAS), as developed in the EU FP 7 project MARINA. Firstly, nanomaterials can be grouped based on limited variation in physicochemical properties to subsequently design an efficient testing strategy that covers the entire group. Secondly, knowledge about exposure, toxicokinetics/fate or hazard, for example via properties such as dissolution rate, aspect ratio, chemical (non-) activity, can be used to organise similar materials in generic groups to frame issues that need further attention, or potentially to <b>read-across.</b> Thirdly, when data related to specific endpoints is required, <b>read-across</b> can be considered, using data from a source material for the target nanomaterial. <b>Read-across</b> could be based on a scientifically sound justification that exposure, distribution to the target (fate/toxicokinetics) and hazard of the target material are similar to, or less than, the source material. These grouping and <b>read-across</b> approaches pave the way for better use of available information on nanomaterials and are flexible enough to allow future adaptations related to scientific developments.

Since the experimental evaluation of nanoparticles causing public health concerns is expensive and time consuming, efficient computational tools are amongst the most suitable approaches to identifying potential negative impacts, to the {{human health and the}} environment, of new nanomaterials before their production. However, developing computational models complimentary to experiments is impossible without incorporating consistent and high quality experimental data. Although there are limited available data in the literature, one may apply <b>read-across</b> techniques that seem to be an attractive and pragmatic alternative way of predicting missing physico-chemical or toxicological data. Unfortunately, the existing methods of <b>read-across</b> are strongly dependent on the expert's knowledge. In consequence, the results of estimations may vary dependently on personal experience of expert conducting the study and as such cannot guarantee the reproducibility of their results. Therefore, it is essential to develop novel <b>read-across</b> algorithm(s) that will provide reliable predictions of the missing data without the need to for additional experiments. We proposed a novel quantitative <b>read-across</b> approach for nanomaterials (Nano-QRA) that addresses and overcomes a basic limitation of existing methods.

However, ready biodegradability of NAPPs with alkyl chain lengths of 16 – 18 carbon atoms and polyamine moieties with three and four nitrogen atoms could not be demonstrated.

40|$|Toxicity of {{chemicals}} is traditionally assessed using animal studies. For reasons of ethics, economy and legislation predictive alternatives {{have to be}} used, whenever possible. Nevertheless, the development of alternatives to animal testing has lagged behind. One alternative in risk assessment {{of chemicals}} is <b>read-across.</b> Here, toxicity data of a tested compound is used to predict the toxicity of a "similar" non-tested compound. As {{one of the main}} routes of exposure to chemicals is the inhalation route, our project combines the <b>read-across</b> approach with genomic data of in vitro and ex vivo respiratory assays. First, we selected three categories of chemicals (vicinale halogenide, aromates, and ester) and defined one lead compound and two <b>read-across</b> in each category. Categories were chosen based on potentially different mode of action. Secondly, repeated exposure of chemicals was performed on three days for three hours daily in rat and human precision-cut lung slices (PCLS). The cytotoxicity of chemicals was assessed in PCLS by LDH and WST- 1 assay. At least one substance in each category showed cytotoxic effect in dose dependent manner. The chemicals did not show increased sensitivity upon repeated exposure. Human PCLS were less sensitive to chemicals compared to rat PCLS maybe due to differences in metabolic activity. This study shows differences of rodent and human metabolism. Although toxicity profiling is based on rodent exposure data, species diversity can be studied ex vivo for better predictively in human. Moreover, results of the project will be used to evaluate the <b>read-across</b> approach based on the tested chemicals...|$|E

A common aim of these case studies was to examine sources of uncertainty associated with <b>read-across.</b> While uncertainty is related to {{the quality and quantity of}} the read across endpoint data, uncertainty also includes a variety of other factors, the foremost of which is uncertainty associated with the justification of similarity and quantity and quality of data for the source chemical(s). This investigation has demonstrated that the assessment of uncertainty associated with a similarity justification includes consideration of the information supporting the scientific arguments and the data associated with the chemical, toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic similarity. Similarity in chemistry is often not enough to justify fully a <b>read-across</b> prediction, thus, for chronic health endpoints, toxicokinetic and/or toxicodynamic similarity is essential. Data from New Approach Methodology(ies) including high throughput screening, in vitro and in chemico assay and in silico tools, may provide critical information needed to strengthen the toxicodynamic similarity rationale.

40|$|AbstractSubstantial {{benefits}} are realized {{through the use}} of <b>read-across</b> and in silico techniques to fill data gaps for structurally similar substances. Considerable experience in applying these techniques was gained under two voluntary high production volume (HPV) chemical programs – the International Council of Chemical Associations' (ICCA) Cooperative Chemicals Assessment Programme (with the cooperation of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development) and the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's HPV Challenge Program. These programs led to the compilation and public availability of baseline sets of health and environmental effects data for thousands of chemicals. The American Cleaning Institute's (ACI) contribution to these national and global efforts included the compilation of these datasets for 261 substances. Chemicals that have structural similarities are likely to have similar environmental fate, physical-chemical and toxicological properties, which was confirmed by examining available data from across the range of substances within categories of structurally similar HPV chemicals.

As many pharmacokinetic parameters for wildlife are unavailable for the majority of drugs in use, a <b>read-across</b> approach was employed using either rodent or human data on absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Comparison of the different steps in the framework, against experimental data for the scenario where birds are feeding on a WWTP contaminated with fluoxetine, showed that: estimated concentrations in wastewater treatment works were lower than measured concentrations; concentrations in food could be reasonably estimated if experimental bioaccumulation data are available; and that <b>read-across</b> from rodent data worked better than human to bird <b>read-across.</b> The framework provides adequate predictions of plasma concentrations and of elimination behavior in birds, but yields poor predictions of distribution in tissues.

Frameworks, such as the <b>Read-across</b> Assessment Framework or the Adverse Outcome Pathway Knowledge Base, support the development of these methods. The aim of the project presented in this publication was to develop substance categories for a <b>read-across</b> with complex endpoints of toxicity based on existing databases. The basic conceptual approach was to combine structural similarity with shared mechanisms of action. Substances with similar chemical structure and toxicological profile form candidate categories suitable for <b>read-across.</b> We combined two databases on repeated dose toxicity, RepDose database, and ELINCS database to form a common database for the identification of categories. The resulting database contained physicochemical, structural, and toxicological data, which were refined and curated for cluster analyses. We applied the Predictive Clustering Tree (PCT) approach for clustering chemicals based on structural and on toxicological information to detect groups of chemicals with similar toxic profiles and pathways/mechanisms of toxicity. As many of the experimental toxicity values were not available, this data was imputed by predicting them with a multi-label classification method, prior to clustering. The clustering results were evaluated by assessing chemical and toxicological similarities with the aim of identifying clusters with a concordance between structural information and toxicity profiles/mechanisms. From these chosen clusters, seven were selected for a quantitative <b>read-across,</b> based on a small ratio of NOAEL of the members with the highest and the lowest NOAEL in the cluster (< 5). We discuss the limitations of the approach. Based on this analysis we propose improvements for a follow-up approach, such as incorporation of metabolic information and more detailed mechanistic information.

40|$|Short-chain mono-alkylphenols {{provide an}} example of where a category-approach to <b>read-across</b> {{may be used to}} {{estimate}} the repeated-dose endpoint for a number of derivatives. Specifically, the NOAELs of 50 mg/kg bw/d for mono-methylphenols based on a LOAEL of very low systemic toxicity can be read across with confidence to untested mono-alkylphenols in the category. These simple alkylphenols are non-reactive and exhibit an unspecific, reversible polar narcosis mode of toxic action. Briefly, polar narcotics act via unspecific, reversible interactions with biological membranes {{in a manner similar to}} cataleptic anaesthetics. The <b>read-across</b> premise includes rapid and complete absorption via the gastrointestinal tract, distribution in the circulatory system, first-pass Phase 2 metabolism in the liver, and elimination of sulphates and glucuronides in the urine. Thus, toxicokinetic parameters are considered to be similar and have the same toxicological significance. Five analogues have high quality experimental oral repeated-dose toxicity data (i. e., OECD TG 408 or OECD TG 422). These repeated-dose toxicity test results exhibit qualitative consistency in symptoms. Typical findings include decreased body weight and slightly increased liver and kidney weights which are generally without concurrent histopathological effects. The sub-chronic findings are quantitatively consistent with the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) of ≥ 50 mg/kg bw/d. Chemical similarity between the analogues is readily defined, and data uncertainty associated with the similarities in toxicokinetic properties, as well as toxicodynamic properties, are low. Uncertainty associated with mechanistic relevance and completeness of the <b>read-across</b> is low-to-moderate, largely because there is no adverse outcome pathway or intermediate event data. Uncertainty associated with mechanistic relevance and completeness of the <b>read-across</b> is reduced by the concordance of in vivo, in vitro, USEPA toxicity forecaster (ToxCast) results, as well as the in silico data.

This legislation stipulates that about 30, 000 chemical substances are to be assessed on their possible risks.

However, there are robust and consistent ex vivo data suggesting many of these chemicals are metabolically transformed, especially in the liver, to reactive electrophilic toxicants which react in a mechanistically similar manner to acrolein, the reactive metabolite of 2 -propen- 1 -ol. Hence, an evaluation was conducted to determine suitability of 2 -propen- 1 -ol as a <b>read-across</b> analogue for other β-olefinic alcohols. The pivotal issue to applying <b>read-across</b> to the proposed category is the confirmation of the biotransformation to metabolites having the same mechanism of electrophilic reactivity, via the same metabolic pathway, with a rate of transformation sufficient to induce the same in vivo outcome. The applicability domain for this case study was limited to small (C 3 to C 6) primary and secondary β-olefinic alcohols. Mechanistically, these β-unsaturated alcohols are considered to be readily metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase to polarised α,β-unsaturated aldehydes and ketones. These metabolites are able to react via the Michael addition reaction mechanism with thiol groups in proteins resulting in cellular apoptosis and/or necrosis. The addition of the non-animal in chemico reactivity data (50 % depletion of free glutathione) reduced the uncertainty so the <b>read-across</b> prediction for the straight-chain olefinic β-unsaturated alcohols is deemed equivalent to a standard test. Specifically, the rat oral 90 -day repeated-dose No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for 2 -propen- 1 -ol of 6 mg/kg body weight (bw) /d in males based on increase in relative weight of liver and 25 mg/kg bw/d in females based on bile duct hyperplasia and periportal hepatocyte hypertrophy in the liver, is read across to fill data gaps for the straight-chained analogues...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Pharmaceuticals in the {{environment}} have received increased attention over the past decade, as they are ubiquitous in rivers and waterways. Concentrations are in sub-ng to low μg/L, well below acute toxic levels, but there are uncertainties regarding the effects of chronic exposures {{and there is a}} need to prioritise which pharmaceuticals may be of concern. The <b>read-across</b> hypothesis stipulates that a drug will have an effect in non-target organisms only if the molecular targets such as receptors and enzymes have been conserved, resulting in a (specific) pharmacological effect only if plasma concentrations are similar to human therapeutic concentrations. If this holds true for different classes of pharmaceuticals, it should be possible to predict the potential environmental impact from information obtained during the drug development process. This paper critically reviews the evidence for <b>read-across,</b> and finds that few studies include plasma concentrations and mode of action based effects. Thus, despite a large number of apparently relevant papers and a general acceptance of the hypothesis, there is an absence of documented evidence. There is a need for large-scale studies to generate robust data for testin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{the current}} paper, a new {{strategy}} for risk assessment of nanomaterials is described, which builds upon previous project outcomes and is developed within the FP 7 NANoREG project. NANoREG has the aim to develop, for the long term, new testing strategies adapted to {{a high number of}} nanomaterials where many factors can affect their environmental and health impact. In the proposed risk assessment strategy, approaches for (Quantitative) Structure Activity Relationships ((Q) SARs), grouping and <b>read-across</b> are integrated and expanded to guide the user how to prioritise those nanomaterial applications that may lead to high risks for human health. Furthermore, those aspects of exposure, kinetics and hazard assessment that {{are most likely to be}} influenced by the nanospecific properties of the material under assessment are identified. These aspects are summarised in six elements, which play a key role in the strategy: exposure potential, dissolution, nanomaterial transformation, accumulation, genotoxicity and immunotoxicity. With the current approach it is possible to identify those situations where the use of nanospecific grouping, <b>read-across</b> and (Q) SAR tools is likely to become feasible in the future, and to point towards the generation of the type of data that is needed for scientific justification, which may lead to regulatory acceptance of nanospecific applications of these tools...|$|E
