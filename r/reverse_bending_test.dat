40|$|To rank {{attempts}} {{of improving the}} resistance of thin (< 0. 5 mm) tungsten sheet-material against delaminations, {{there is a need}} for a testing procedure which allows to measure the tendency of the material to from delamination cracks. In this contribution, several testing procedures are examined with respect to their ability to initiate delaminations. The <b>reverse</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test</b> turned out to be the most suitable procedure to measure the delamination behavior. The observation of acoustic emission allows an accurate detection of the moment of crack formation and the corresponding bending angle. To get information about the stress distribution during a test, a finite element analysis was carried out. It is shown that specific parameters of the hot rolling process influence the delamination behavior of the sheet material in a significant and reproducible manner. Other fracture patterns like 45 ° embrittlement were also observed and were correlated to specific hot rolling conditions...|$|E

40|$|The S/N {{fatigue life}} gage {{is a small}} sensor which is similar in {{appearance}} to a foil strain gage. The S/N fatigue life gage is bonded {{to the surface of}} a mechanical structure using standard strain-gage techniques. The S/N gage changes resistance permanently as a continuous function of fatigue experience. This gage was developed by Mr. Darrell R. Harting of the Boeing Company, Seattle, Washington. The gage is produced commercially by Micro-Measurements, Inc. and distributed by W. T. Bean, Inc., Detroit, Michigan. This investigation describes the results of a series of <b>reverse</b> <b>bending</b> <b>tests</b> on S/N fatigue life gages which were mounted on Ti- 6 A 1 - 4 V titanium specimens. Each S/N gage was subjected to various constant strain loadings for varying numbers of cycles. The results of this investigation show that the performance of the S/N fatigue gage under random cyclic loading is predictable. Another result of the tests indicates that the S/N gage experiences an above normal increase in resistance well in advance of actual gage failure. Finally it was observed that a decrease in S/N gage resistance will occur: immediately after the mean cyclic strain level is lowered; and whenever the gage is subjected to any substantial rest period.

40|$|In {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of sheet metal forming the use of combined isotropic-kinematic hardening models is advisable to improve stamping simulation and springback prediction. This choice becomes compulsory to model recent materials such as high strength steels. Cyclic tests are strictly required to evaluate the parameters of these constitutive models. However, for sheet metal specimens, in case of simple axial tension-compression tests, buckling occurrence during compression represents a serious drawback. This {{is the reason why}} alternative set-ups have been devised. In this paper, two experimental arrangements (a cyclic laterally constrained tension-compression test and a three-point fully <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> <b>test)</b> are compared so as to point out the advantages and the disadvantages of their application in tuning the well-known Chaboche’s hardening model. In particular, for tension-compression tests, a new clamping device was specifically designed to inhibit compressive instability. Four high strength steel grades were tested: two dual phases (DP), one transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) and one high strength low alloy material (HSLA). Then, the Chaboche’s model was calibrated through inverse identification methods or by means of analytical expressions when possible. The proposed testing procedure proved to be successful in all investigated materials. The achieved constitutive parameters, obtained independently from the two experimental techniques, were found to be consistent. Their accuracy was also been assessed by applying the parameter set obtained from one test to simulate the other one, and vice versa. Clues on what method provides the better transferability are given. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4006919...|$|R

The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the effect of {{successive}} TIG (tungsten inert gas) welding repairs on the <b>reverse</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue strength of AISI 4130 steel, which is widely used in components critical to the flight-safety. In order to simulate the abrupt maneuvers, wind bursts, motor vibration and helixes efforts, which generate cyclic bending loadings at the welded joints of a specific aircraft component called "motor cradle", experimental <b>reverse</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue <b>tests</b> were carried out on specimens made from hot-rolled steel plate, 1. 10 mm (0. 043 in) thick, by mean of a SCHENK PWS equipment, with load ratio R =- 1, under constant amplitude, at 30 Hz frequency and room temperature. It was observed that the bending fatigue strength decreases after the TIG (Tungsten Inert Gas) welding process application on AISI 4130 steel, with subsequent decrease due to re-welding sequence as well.

This investigation explored {{the effects of}} different combinations of LSP parameters, such as irradiance (GW/cm 2) and laser pulse density (spots/mm 2), on 3. 2 mm thick AA 6056 -T 4 samples, for integral airframe applications. The most significant effects that are introduced by LSP without a protective coating include residual stress and surface roughness, since each laser pulse vaporizes the surface layer of the target. Each of these effects was quantified, whereby residual stress analysis was performed using X-ray diffraction with synchrotron radiation. A series of fully <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue <b>tests</b> was conducted, in order to evaluate fatigue performance enhancements {{with the aim of}} identifying LSP parameter influence.

40|$|Fully <b>reversed</b> <b>bending</b> fatigue <b>tests</b> were {{performed}} on polished hour-glass specimens of commercially pure titanium grade 1 with three different grain sizes, that were produced by severe plastic deformation (rotary swaging) and subheat treatments, {{in order to examine}} the effect of grain size on fatigue. An improvement in fatigue strength was observed, as the polycrystal grain size was refined. The endurance limit stress was shown to depend on the inverse square root of the grain size as described empirically by a type of Hall-Petch relation. The effect of refining grain size on fatigue crack growth is {{to increase the number of}} microstructural barriers to the advancing crack and to reduce the slip length ahead of the crack tip, and thereby lower the crack growth rate. It was found that postdeformation annealing above recrystallization temperature could additionally enhance the work-hardening capability and the ductility of the swaged material, which led to a marked reduction in the fatigue notch sensitivity. At the same time, this reduction was accompanied with a pronounced loss in strength. The high cycle fatigue performance was discussed in detail based on microstructure and mechanical properties...|$|R

40|$|<b>Bending</b> and <b>reverse</b> <b>bending</b> are the {{dominant}} material deformations in roll forming, and hence property data derived from <b>bend</b> <b>tests</b> {{could be more}} relevant than tensile test data for numerical simulation of a roll forming process. Recent investigations have shown that residual stresses change the material behavior close to the yield in a <b>bending</b> <b>test.</b> So, residual stresses introduced during prior steel processing operations may affect the roll forming process, and therefore {{they need to be}} included in roll forming simulations to achieve improved model accuracy. Measuring the residual stress profile experimentally is time consuming and has limited accuracy while analytical models that are available require detailed information about the pre-processing conditions that is generally not available for roll forming materials.

The bend that occurred {{in the same direction as}} the curve of head was defined as the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> and the bend in the opposite direction as the principal bend. In hamster spermatozoa, flagellar bending was asymmetric to the direction of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> after incubation for 5 min. After incubation for 4 h the asymmetry had increased, as the angles of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> had increased in all regions of the flagellum but the principal bend had not.

In the hyperactivated mouse spermatozoa incubated for 3 h, the angle of the principal bend increased in the distal region and those of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bends</b> increased in almost all regions of the flagellum. Since the increase in the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> was relatively high, flagellar bending became asymmetric to the direction of the <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> as in hamster spermatozoa.

Design/methodology/approach: Both the finite element analysis and experiments were performed to analyzethe deformation mechanics {{and the effects of}} process parameters on the formation of springback. Findings: The axial stress distribution in the bent sheet obtained by the finite element simulations was classifiedinto three zones: the bending zone under the punch corner (zone I), unbending zone next to the bending zone(zone II), and the stress-free zone (zone III). It is found that the stress distribution in zone I is quite uniformand hence has little influence on the springback. While the stress distribution in zone II results in a positivespringback, whereas the stress distribution in zone III produces a negative springback. The total springbacktherefore depends on the combined effect of those produced by zone II and zone III. A <b>reverse</b> <b>bend</b> approachthat can efficiently reduce springback was also proposed to reduce the springback in the L-bending process. Thefinite element analysis performed {{in the present study was}} validated by experiments as well.
