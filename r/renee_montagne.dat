5000|$|These texts provide {{information}} about racial violence in the United States and provide background {{on the history of}} race relations in South Carolina in particular and the United States in general. They also offer education on race, racial identities, global white supremacy and black resistance. Several of the suggested readings shed light on race and racism on a global scale.

5000|$|In April 2004, NPR {{executives}} {{decided to}} [...] "freshen up" [...] Morning Editions sound. Edwards was removed as host, replaced with Steve Inskeep and <b>Renée</b> <b>Montagne,</b> and reassigned {{as a senior}} correspondent for NPR News. The move took him by surprise. [...] "Id rather stay," [...] he said, [...] "but its not my decision to make." [...] At first, NPR executives and spokespersons did not fully explain the move, leaving many listeners confused. [...] Eventually they did make some attempts to explain themselves. According to NPR spokeswoman Laura Gross, [...] "Its part of a natural evolution. A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bobs voice will still be heard; hell still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt {{it was time for}} a change." [...] Executive Vice President Ken Stern also explained the move. [...] "This change in Morning Edition is part of the ongoing evaluation of all NPR programming that has taken place over the last several years. Weve looked at shows like All Things Considered and Talk of the Nation with an eye to how we can best serve listeners in the future." [...] Although Stern later participated in an online chat with listeners at NPRs website, it only heightened their confusion and anger.|$|E
50|$|Bob Edwards, {{previously}} a {{co-host of}} All Things Considered, hosted Morning Edition beginning with its first episode, {{a job he}} initially took on a temporary basis when a shake-up in production and on-air staff occurred ten days before the show's premiere. Edwards was joined by Barbara Hoctor, then of Weekend All Things Considered. Hoctor departed after four months, leaving Edwards as solo host for the next quarter-century. His last day as host was April 30, 2004; this was not due to Edwards retiring, but rather a highly controversial decision from NPR to reassign him as senior correspondent, which resulted in anger and harsh criticism from many listeners. From May 3, 2004 through November 11, 2016 the show was co-hosted by Steve Inskeep and <b>Renée</b> <b>Montagne,</b> with David Greene joining as co-host in 2012. Inskeep reports from NPR headquarters in Washington, D.C. and Montagne reported {{from the studios of}} NPR West in Culver City, California, a municipality within Los Angeles County. Montagne announced in July, 2016 that she would step down as co-host to become a special correspondent for NPR. On December 5, 2016, after Renée Montagne's departure, David Greene will begin broadcasting from NPR West, and Rachel Martin, former host of Weekend Edition, will join Morning Edition, broadcasting alongside Inskeep from NPR's headquarters in Washington, D.C.|$|E

Prior to that, he had served as Alumni Association board member and as President of that {{organization}} from 1969-1971.Upon his retirement in 1985, the E.W. Scripps Company established the E.W. Estlow Fund in his honor. Beginning in 1992, the University of Denver utilized the Edward W. Estlow Fund for Journalism to invite a prominent journalist to campus each year to offer the Edward W. Estlow Lecture. In 1997, the Anvil of Freedom Award was established to recognize the Estlow Lecturer's leadership and commitment to the First Amendment. The Anvil of Freedom Award has been given to recognize the work of prominent journalists and innovators in journalistic endeavors. Some prior recipients have included Pulitzer prizewinning journalist David S. Broder, White House bureau chief Helen Thomas, Washington Times Editor-in-Chief Katharine Graham, CBS Evening News anchor Bob Schieffer, NPR host <b>Renee</b> <b>Montagne,</b> and the first worldwide citizen news initiative offering translations into more than 30 languages, Global Voices Online.In 2000, the Estlows worked with the University of Denver to establish the Edward W. Estlow International Center for Journalism and New Media.

40|$|In November, Colorado Senator Michael Bennet {{was interviewed}} on National Public Radio's Morning Edition by <b>Renee</b> <b>Montagne.</b> In {{the course of}} the interview, Senator Bennet told Ms. Montagne that, as a 45 -year old, he would get no Social Security benefit if the program is not fixed. This is not true. CEPR has {{prepared}} a table showing the scheduled Social Security benefit for each member of the Senate. It also shows the payable benefit, assuming that the projections for the program prove accurate, and Congress never makes any changes to Social Security. (It has made numerous changes in prior decades.) This table is intended to help the Senators in preparing their personal finances. It should also help to inform them in making decisions {{about the future of the}} program. And, hopefully it will prevent them from misleading the public as Senator Bennet did...|$|E
