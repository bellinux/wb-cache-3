50|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{introduction}} of the VHS format, VHS tape rewinders were developed. These devices served the sole purpose of rewinding VHS tapes. Proponents of the rewinders argued that the use of the rewind function on the standard VHS player would lead to wear and tear of the transport mechanism. The <b>rewinder</b> would rewind the tapes smoothly and also normally do so at a faster rate than the standard rewind function on VHS players. However some <b>rewinder</b> brands did have some frequent abrupt stops, which occasionally led to tape damage.|$|E

Although super-speed <b>rewinders</b> may seem convenient, they will warp and damage tapes over time. Professional media librarians at the National Library of Canada suggest {{that the best way}} to achieve an archival wind for reel-to-reel tapes is to remove the heads on the player and play {{backwards}} at normal play speed. However, the tape tension may need to be adjusted after removing the heads.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the term}} [...] "slitter rewinder" [...] or [...] "slitting machine" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} the machine, the three parts are referred to as the unwind, the slitting section and the rewind. Slitter <b>rewinders</b> are normally used to slit plastic films, paper and metal foils. The unwind stage holds the roll stably and allows it to spin; it is either braked or driven to maintain accurate tension in the material. Some machines have a driven unwind which reduces the effect of inertia when starting to unwind heavy rolls or when the material is very tension-sensitive.|$|R

40|$|One {{important}} {{topic in}} Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is {{a desire for}} faster and more efficient scanning, with an elimination, or at least minimization, of artifacts in the resulting image. Reducing patient discomfort, increasing scanner throughput, difficulties in imaging dynamic elements (cardiovascular system), and minimization of movement artifacts motivate faster scan times. To this end, more complicated and mathematically intense sampling strategies have been developed which either under-sample or ignore portions of k-space. These missing samples manifest themselves as specific artifacts indicative of the sampling strategy {{and the amount of}} under-sampling. Durga uses pseudo-random, volumetric and velocity insensitive k-space trajectories, which are derived from second-order cone optimization problems [2]. Under-sampling a random trajectory results in artifacts which resemble incoherent noise [19] instead of aliased images. Velocity insensitive trajectories do not require <b>rewinders</b> to balance first or higher order moments...|$|R
40|$|Some paper-mill <b>rewinders</b> use infra-red {{carbon dioxide}} laser heads to slit the web into rolls of given widths. However, despite certain advantages, laser slitters are not widely used {{mainly because of}} {{installation}} and operation costs. Web breaks on a printing press cause both time and paper waste. Breakings occur because of defects in {{the edges of the}} web, such as notches or extra fibers, which offer less resitance to the high tensions existing during the printing of a web at high speed. Since paper edges are much cleaner when cut with an infra-red carbon dioxide laser than when cut with knives, it is possible that laser-cut edges might be stronger and thus reduce the number of breakings of the web. In order to test this hypothesis, tensile tests were carried out on laser-cut and shear-cut strips for three different types of papers (coated and uncoated stock, and newsprint) and results were compared. Since direct observation of the effect of a laser beam on cellulose fibers might help in explaining differences in behavior between the two types of paper samples, a scanning electron microscope was used to take photographs of paper areas following treatment with a CO 2 laser functioning in pulsed mode. The photographs revealed a drastic change in the structure of hit cellulose: the latter looks melted. This 2 ̆ 2 melted 2 ̆ 2 portion of a laser-cut paper edge is extremely thin (several micrometers) and seems to slow down the combustion of adjacent fibers. Regarding tensile tests results, laser-cut strips are always stronger, but the relative difference between the two types of specimens is very low (less than 1...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{motor driven}} systems (EMODS) account for over 40 % of global {{electrical}} energy demand, i. e., 7400 TWh per year, and for about 70 % {{of the demand}} for industrial electrical energy, being {{by far the most}} important electrical load. Furthermore, EMODS offer today large efficiency improvement potential, on average within 20 % to 30 %. If the energy saving potential associated with EMODS becomes effective, the consumption of a huge amount of fossil fuels can be avoided. The greenhouse gas emissions can significantly be reduced at zero or even negative costs, since the efficiency improvement measures in EMODS are, in general, cost-effective. Therefore, EMODS can {{play a key role in}} helping many countries’ efforts to meet the post-Kyoto targets. This can strongly contribute to combat climate change and fossil fuel dependency of modern economies, providing that, at the same time, other measures are implemented, namely the promotion of renewable energies. If all EMODS were optimized, energy cost savings could reach 65 - 100 G€ per year worldwide and a huge amount of greenhouse gas emissions could be avoided. Nowadays, in the scope of world energy issues, the importance of the performance improvement of EMODS is evident. However, in most cases, the investment in energy efficiency is not yet a major concern in new plants or during refurbishment. This thesis is meant to be a contribution on that scope, offering several comprehensive overviews and novel contributions on different EMODS-related topics. Briefly, recent developments and strategies to improve the performance of EMODS integrating three-phase induction motors, which account for the largest majority of the industrial electric motors, are addressed, including technical, economical, and policy aspects. The focus is on the efficiency and reliability of EMODS, being discussed several related topics such as motor performance, variable-speed drives, power quality, mechanical transmission, and system design. The end-use or mechanical-load devices are not analysed in terms of intrinsic performance, although the speed variation impact on the respective required power is taken into account. Motor efficiency and life-cycle cost related aspects are analysed, and information regarding motor standards, eco-design and market transformation, is presented. The impact of motor speed variation and inverters on EMODS efficiency and reliability is also addressed, including a comparison between 2 -level and 3 -level voltage-source inverters. Regarding three-phase induction motors, useful methods for in-field motor load estimation are analysed, being proposed a number of improvements in some well-known methods. Novel considerations on stator winding specifications and connectionmode change, as a function of the motor actual operating conditions, for both two-connection (delta or star) and multi-connection motors, are presented, including the discussion of theoretical, simulation (motor models), and implementation issues. Regarding the stator winding connection-mode management, besides the general proposed methodology, it is also proposed a novel electronic device for that purpose. Methodologies for stator winding optimization and/or customization, particularly useful for the rewinding process, including a tutorial and a user-friendly stator winding redesign software to help <b>rewinders</b> to improve motor performance for each particular situation, are proposed. Due to its present relevance, power quality impact on line- and inverter-fed motors is also discussed. A number of considerations on motor and EMODS reliability, including a comprehensive and extensive analysis on bearing currents and on voltage transients associated with inverter-fed motors, are presented. The most important contributions were previously published in national and international journals and/or conference proceedings. Some of the topics addressed in this thesis are still under research and future publications on them are expected.

50|$|The vast {{majority}} of gravure presses print on rolls (also known as webs) of paper or other substrates, rather than sheets. (Sheetfed gravure is a small, specialty market.) Rotary gravure presses are the fastest and widest presses in operation, printing everything from narrow labels to 12-foot-wide (3.66-meter-wide) rolls of vinyl flooring. For maximum efficiency, gravure presses operate at high speeds producing large diameter, wide rolls. These are then cut or slit down to the finished roll size on a slitting machine or slitter <b>rewinder.</b> Additional operations may be in line with a gravure press, such as saddle stitching facilities for magazine or brochure work.|$|E
5000|$|Roll {{slitting}} is {{a shearing}} operation that cuts a large roll of material into narrower rolls. There {{are two types}} of slitting: log slitting and rewind slitting. In log slitting the roll of material is treated as a whole (the 'log') and one or more slices are taken from it without an unrolling/re-reeling process. In rewind slitting the web is unwound and run through the machine, passing through knives or lasers, before being rewound on one or more shafts to form narrower rolls. The multiple narrower strips of material may be known as mults (short for multiple) or pancakes if their diameter is much more than their width. For rewind slitting the machine used is called a slitter <b>rewinder,</b> a slitter or a slitting machine - these names are used interchangeably for the same machines. [...] For particularly narrow & thin products the pancakes become unstable, and then the rewind may be onto a bobbin-wound reel: the rewind bobbins are much wider than the slit width and the web oscillates across the reel as it is rewound. Apart from the stability benefit it is also then possible to put very long lengths, (frequently many tens of kilometres), onto one bobbin.|$|E

Typically the unwinding {{system is the}} Rodney Dangerfield on a line or slitter <b>rewinder.</b> The slitting system and the winding system are considered with great importance but the unwinding system does not get the respect it deserves. Although often considered a simple function, {{the selection of a}} proper unwinding system is extremely important to the overall productivity of the converting or slitting and rewinding operation. This paper is a Practical Guide for selecting the right unwind and related equipment to best match the unwinding system’s Cost verses Efficiency to ensure the maximum performance and productivity from a converting line and/or slitter <b>rewinder.</b> Design Criteria- The first thing that must be established is the basic design criteria. This basic design criteria will help select the design of unwind best suited for the application. The variation of these parameters dictate the flexibility required, and therefore the complexity and cost of the system. The following must be determined: 1. Materials to be processed: Types- composites, extensible, non-extensible Basis weight range Thickness range for each material and basis weight 2. Roll diameters and weights 3. Speed of operation 4. Tension- Tensile strength of materials 5. Core materials and sizes: Length variations Inside diameter and tolerances Outside diameters 6. Roll delivery systems The old rule “jack of all trades and master of none ” applies to the unwind operation so be realistic when specifying the required range for best value and performance of the unwinding system.

40|$|Abstract. The round-complexity of black-box {{zero-knowledge}} has {{for years}} been {{a topic of}} much interest. Results in this area generally focus on either proving lower bounds in various settings (e. g., Canetti, Kilian, Petrank, and Rosen [3] prove concurrent zero-knowledge (cZK) requires Ω(log n/log log n) rounds and Barak and Lindell [2] show no constant-round single-session protocol can be zero-knowledge with strict poly-time simulators), or giving upper bounds (e. g., Prabhakaran, Rosen, and Sahai [15] give a cZK protocol with ω(log n) rounds). In this paper we show that though proving upper bounds seems to be quite different from demonstrating lower bounds, underlying both tasks there is a single, simple combinatorial game between two players: a <b>rewinder</b> and a scheduler. We give two theorems relating the success of rewinders in the game to both {{upper and lower bounds}} for black-box zero-knowledge in various settings (single-session, concurrent composition, etc). Our game and theorems unify the previous results in the area, simplify the task of proving upper and lower bounds, and should be useful in showing future results in the area. ...|$|E

In addition, Roll-to-Roll systems are also considered as a cost effective mass production solution for printed electronics, such as RFID and Solar cells in the recent years [1]. In a Roll-to-Roll system, web material often experiences lateral motion during the transportation to processes [1]. This project presents the lateral dynamics control system integration using centred pivoted displacement guide for Roll-to-Roll application. An initial literature review of the project is carried out with supporting theory and web handling mechanism. The complete system design consists of four units, namely unwinder unit, load cell unit, guide unit and <b>rewinder</b> unit. In this project, two microcontrollers are proposed to control the four units with additional instrumentation and signal conditioning between sensors/actuators, and the controller. The Guide system dynamics are simulated using first order single degree-of-freedom oscillator model controlled with classical PID servo designs. Finally, the complete system is tested with different disturbances input to the system. The system lateral response is compared with and without the guide system.

40|$|AbstractLaser {{technology}} {{has been used in}} industrial processes for several decades. The most advanced development and implementation took place in laser welding and cutting of metals in automotive and ship building industries. However, there is high potential to apply laser processing to other materials in various industrial fields. One of these potential fields could be paper industry to fulfill the demand for high quality, fast and reliable cutting technology. Difficulties in industrial application of laser cutting for paper industry are associated to lack of basic information, awareness of technology and its application possibilities. Nowadays possibilities of using laser cutting for paper materials are widened and high automation level of equipment has made this technology more interesting for manufacturing processes. Promising area of laser cutting application at paper making machines is longitudinal cutting of paper web (edge trimming). There are few locations at a paper making machine where edge trimming is usually done: wet press section, calender or <b>rewinder.</b> Paper web is characterized with different moisture content at different points of the paper making machine.
