40|$|In {{this paper}} a novel silicon {{micropump}} for liquids and gases is presented, which is tolerant towards gas-bubbles {{and which is}} able to prime itself. The micropump {{is based on a}} piezoelectrically driven diaphragm actuator, which is combined with a <b>valve</b> <b>unit</b> consisting of two cantilever valves. The self-priming and bubble-tolerant operation mode was achieved by maximizing the compression ratio, which was realized by minimizing the dead volume of the <b>valve</b> <b>unit</b> {{as well as of the}} actuator unit and by maximizing the stroke volume of the pump diaphragm. The optimization of the actuator is based on simulations and experimental investigations of the pump diaphragm displacement. These studies yield the optimal dimensions of the pump diaphragm and the piezoactuator. The piezoelectrically actuated micropump was characterized by investigating the pump rate in dependence of the actuation frequency and the pressure on the inlet and the outlet port of the micropump.

40|$|In this study, we {{developed}} a method for fabricating a microfluidic device with integrated large-scale all-glass valves and constructed an actuator system to control each of the valves on the device. Such a microfluidic device has advantages that allow its use in various fields, including physical, chemical, and biochemical analyses and syntheses. However, it is inefficient and difficult to integrate the large-scale all-glass valves in a microfluidic device using conventional glass fabrication methods, especially for the through-hole fabrication step. Therefore, we have developed a fabrication method for the large-scale integration of all-glass valves in a microfluidic device that contains 110 individually controllable diaphragm <b>valve</b> <b>units</b> on a 30 mm × 70 mm glass slide. This prototype device was fabricated by first sandwiching a 0. 4 -mm-thick glass slide that contained 110 1. 5 -mm-diameter shallow chambers, each with two 50 -μm-diameter through-holes, between an ultra-thin glass sheet (4 μm thick) and another 0. 7 -mm-thick glass slide that contained etched channels. After the fusion bonding of these three layers, the large-scale microfluidic device was obtained with integrated all-glass valves consisting of 110 individual diaphragm <b>valve</b> <b>units.</b> We demonstrated its use as a pump capable of generating a flow rate of approximately 0. 06 – 5. 33 μL/min.

40|$|The {{failure of}} mitral valve repair {{procedures}} {{revealed in the}} outcomes of the recent randomized studies is suggesting the necessity for {{a better understanding of}} the biomechanical mechanisms underlying the failure of the surgical approaches. Use of biomechanical modelling and finite element analysis (FEA) in cardiovascular research is an important aid in this context. In our group we developed a biomechanical model taking into account all the component of the mitral <b>valve</b> functional <b>unit</b> including the <b>valve</b> leaflets, the annulus, the papillary muscles, the chordae tendinea and the ventricular geometry. The two-dimensional mathematical model was capable to predict some of the actual geometrical and mechanical features of the valvular and subvalvular apparatuses in physiological and pathological conditions providing the engineering quantitative relations between closing and tethering forces and the mechanisms governing the mitral <b>valve</b> <b>unit</b> function. This model might further become patient-specific by means of 3 D reconstruction of clinical imaging. Images are first converted in a standard vector format (DICOM, etc.), then automatically translated in a "structural" finite element model and finally implemented in a finite element code.
