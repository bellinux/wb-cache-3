50|$|During Disney's Year of a Million Dreams {{promotion}} (January 2007-December 2008), many guests {{received a}} special Dream Fastpass. Cast members awarded Dream Fastpasses to guests standing at predetermined random locations inside the park, at predetermined times (usually {{within the first}} few hours of opening). The Dream Fastpass was a card hung on a lanyard with a <b>removable</b> <b>tab</b> for each enabled attraction. Guests could enter the Fastpass return line whenever they chose, where they handed over that attraction's tab.|$|E
5000|$|The {{safety and}} litter {{problems}} were both eventually solved {{later in the}} 1970s with Daniel F. Cudzik's invention of the non-removing [...] "Stay-Tab". The pull-ring was replaced with a stiff aluminum lever, and the <b>removable</b> <b>tab</b> was replaced with a pre-scored round tab that functioned similarly to the push-tab, but the raised blister was no longer needed, as the riveted lever would now do the job of pushing the tab open and into {{the interior of the}} can.|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, whilst at {{a picnic}} with friends and family, Fraze decided to create an {{improved}} beverage can-opener instead of the separate [...] "church key" [...] opener - {{he had left his}} at home, so he had to use a car bumper to open the drinks. The old way of opening a can required a separate opener; Fraze wanted to find a solution that would eliminate the need for a one. This event {{led to the creation of}} the pull-tab opener. The first type that he created is not the in modern usage; it was dangerous for the user often causing injury. It used a lever that pierced a hole in the top of the can which produced sharp edges. Later that year, he established a mechanism known as the [...] "pull-tab" [...] can. Users are simply required to pull a <b>removable</b> <b>tab</b> to open the drink. He received U.S. patent No. 3,349,949 for invention in 1963, and subsequently sold his invention to Alcoa. By 1965, around 75% of U.S. breweries were using them. However, in the mid-1970s, pressure from environmentalists led to the development of the non-removable tabs used today. By 1980, his company was supplying can-end machinery worldwide making over $500 million in annual revenue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{similarly}} designed [...] "Easy-open ecology end" [...] {{was invented}} by Ermal Fraze and Omar Brown. Its patent application was also filed in 1975. This design, like Cudzik's, uses a separate tab attached to the upper surface as a lever to depress a scored part of the lid, which folds underneath {{the top of the}} can and {{out of the way of}} the resulting opening, thus reducing injuries and roadside litter caused by <b>removable</b> <b>tabs.</b>|$|R
50|$|For 1995, the XP now sported the new X-4 hull {{which was}} based on race hulls used the {{previous}} year. The hull was extended at the rear, narrowed at the bow, and trim strips were added {{on both sides of the}} stern. This hull handled far superior to the previous hulls. It had <b>removable</b> trim <b>tabs</b> at the rear which could be shimmed with a kit offered over the counter to trim the hull as desired. Also, a 4 inch long pump spacer was added in front of the pump. While this spacer added slightly to the top speed, it hurt performance in rough water because of the extra time it took to fill the increased volume with water once the pump came unhooked. The engine's displacement was again increased, now to 720cc, rated at 85 horsepower. The 95s used the same upper deck as 94s, aside of some color and graphic changes. The graphics theme moved from green and red to yellow and purple, with the hull seat, intake grills, cowling and handle pole cover becoming yellow, while the grips, boarding handle, rub rail and traction mats moved to purple. The deck remained white.|$|R
