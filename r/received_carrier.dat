50|$|In some countries, EMS {{messages}} cannot {{generally be}} sent between subscribers of different mobile phone carriers, {{as they will}} frequently be dropped by the inter-carrier network or by the <b>receiving</b> <b>carrier.</b> However, in other countries, such as the UK, inter-carrier interoperability is generally achieved.|$|R
50|$|The {{detector}} {{was provided}} with a cathode feedback level well into the oscillation range by the 330 pF capacitor. The <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> blocked the oscillations, allowing strong local stations to be received clearly. In addition, the loop antenna {{was part of the}} resonant tuning circuit, resulting in near-unity coupling between the antenna and the detector, which helped provide a high enough level of carrier for the blocking function. A regenerative detector operated in this mode is sometimes called a superregenerative detector, but in this circuit there was no separate quenching oscillator. The blocking signal was ideally at the same frequency as the oscillation, as opposed to the usually lower frequency employed in a true supperregenerative detector.|$|E
50|$|The {{critical}} information {{that allowed the}} receiver to compute location was a unique frequency curve caused by the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect caused an apparent compression of the carrier's wavelength as the satellite approached the receiver, and stretching of wavelengths as the satellite receded. The spacecraft traveled at about 17,000 mph, which could increase or decrease {{the frequency of the}} <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> signal by as much as 10 kHz. This Doppler curve was unique for each location within line-of-sight of the satellite. For instance, the earth's rotation caused the ground receiver to move toward or away from the satellite's orbit, creating a non-symmetric Doppler shift for approach and recession, allowing the receiver to determine whether it was east or west of the satellite's north-south ground track.|$|E

Grey routes can be prevented by good Fraud Management or by regulators or carriers opting to close the gap between the international and domestic tariffs. Tariffs are usually a maximum and thus sometimes carriers opt to lower the international rates to prevent grey routes.|$|R

40|$|A {{multistage}} estimation {{scheme is}} presented for estimating {{the parameters of}} a <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> signal possibly phase-modulated by unknown data and experiencing very high Doppler, Doppler rate, etc. Such a situation arises, for example, {{in the case of}} the Global Positioning Systems (GPS). In the proposed scheme, the first-stage estimator operates as a coarse estimator of the frequency and its derivatives, resulting in higher rms estimation errors but with a relatively small probability of the frequency estimation error exceeding one-half of the sampling frequency (an event termed cycle slip). The second stage of the estimator operates on the error signal available from the first stage, refining the overall estimates, and in the process also reduces the number of cycle slips. The first-stage algorithm is a modified least-squares algorithm operating on the differential signal model and referred to as differential least squares (DLS). The second-stage algorithm is an extended Kalman filter, which yields the estimate of the phase as well as refining the frequency estimate. A major advantage of the is a reduction in the threshold for the <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> power-to-noise power spectral density ratio (CNR) as compared with the threshold achievable by either of the algorithms alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} track very weak signals from distant {{spacecraft}} {{is limited by}} the phase instabilities of the received signal and of the local oscillator employed by the receiver. These instabilities ultimately limit the minimum loop bandwidth {{that can be used in}} a phase-coherent receiver, and hence limit the ratio of <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> power to noise spectral density which can be tracked phase coherently. A method is presented for near real time estimation of the <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> phase and additive noise spectrum, and optimization of the phase locked loop bandwidth. The method was used with the breadboard Deep Space Network (DSN) Advanced Receiver to optimize tracking of very weak signals from the Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which is now more distant that the edge of the solar system. Tracking with bandwidths of 0. 1 Hz to 1. 0 Hz reduces tracking signal threshold and increases carrier loop signal to noise ratio (SNR) by 5 dB to 15 dB compared to the 3 Hz bandwidth of the receivers now used operationally in the DSN. This will enable the DSN to track Pioneer 10 until its power sources fails near the end of the century...|$|E
40|$|Abstract – In {{this paper}} we present an {{algorithm}} for joint carrier phase estimation and turbo decoding {{for the case}} of rapidly varying carrier phase during the transmitted block. The proposed algorithm shows improved performance over previously proposed communication schemes, both coherent and non-coherent, for channels with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and high carrier phase noise. The novel algorithm utilizes a modified “two dimensional ” Bit-Carrierphase A Posteriori Probability (BCAPP) decoder containing additional states representing the <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> phase. The BCAPP decoder calculates two extrinsic metrics; one representing the bit soft value and the other representing the <b>received</b> <b>carrier</b> phase Probability Density Function (PDF) approximation. A modified structure of the turbo code iterations is suggested, implementing separate propagation of the two metrics between the BCAPP decoders. Most known methods to combat very high phase noise in the channel at {{low signal to noise}} ratio are based on non-coherent demodulation. Such reception schemes are designed for the worst-case phase noise and suffer high degradation for any level of phase noise. In our scheme, together with improved performance in high phase noise, the degradation decreases with the actual channel phase noise level. We show the robustness against phase noise model mismatch.

50|$|By default, when a modem {{is powered}} up, the DCD signal is de{{asserted}}.

DCD is deasserted once the local modem is no longer <b>receiving</b> <b>carrier</b> from the remote modem, regardless of which side initiated the disconnect. So long as the DCD signal is high, the computer can assume that any data coming from the modem was sent from the remote side.|$|R
