50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue suspension lines to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft suspension lines, the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> <b>cutters),</b> and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment. The drogue parachute has a design load of approximately 315000 lb and weighs approximately 1200 lb.|$|R
50|$|After the drogue chute has {{stabilized}} the SRB in a tail-first attitude, the frustum {{is separated}} from the forward skirt by a pyrotechnic charge triggered by the low-altitude baroswitch at a nominal altitude of 5500 ft about 243 seconds after SRB separation. The frustum is then {{pulled away from the}} SRB by the drogue chute. The main chute suspension lines are pulled out from deployment bags that remain in the frustum. At full extension of the lines, which are 203 ft long, the three main chutes are pulled from their deployment bags and inflate to their first reefed condition. The frustum and drogue parachute continue on a separate trajectory to splashdown. After specified time delays (using redundant 10 and 17-second <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> <b>cutters),</b> the main chute <b>reefing</b> <b>lines</b> are cut and the chutes inflate to their second reefed and full open configurations. The main chute cluster decelerates the SRB to terminal conditions. Each of the 136 ft diameter, 20-degree conical ribbon parachutes have a design load of approximately 195000 lb and each weighs approximately 2180 lb. These parachutes are the largest that have ever been used — both in deployed size and load weight. The RSRM nozzle extension is severed by a pyrotechnic charge about 20 seconds after frustum separation.|$|R

40|$|<b>Reefing</b> <b>lines</b> are an {{essential}} feature to manage inflation loads. During each Engineering Development Unit (EDU) {{test of the}} Capsule Parachute Assembly System (CPAS), a chase aircraft is staged to be level with the cluster of Main ringsail parachutes during the initial inflation and reefed stages. This allows for capturing high-quality still photographs of the <b>reefed</b> skirt, suspension <b>line,</b> and canopy geometry. The over-inflation angles are synchronized with measured loads data in order to compute the tension force in the <b>reefing</b> <b>line.</b> The traditional <b>reefing</b> tension equation assumes radial symmetry, but cluster effects cause the reefed skirt of each parachute to elongate to a more elliptical shape. This effect was considered in evaluating multiple parachutes to estimate the semi-major and semi-minor axes. Three flight tests are assessed, including one with a skipped first stage, which had peak <b>reefing</b> <b>line</b> tension over three {{times higher than the}} nominal parachute disreef sequence...|$|R

50|$|Slab reefing, which {{involves}} lowering the sail by about one-quarter to {{one-third of its}} full length and tightening {{the lower part of}} the sail using an outhaul or a pre-loaded <b>reef</b> <b>line</b> through a cringle at the new clew, and hook through a cringle at the new tack.|$|R
5000|$|Once {{the sail}} is reefed, raise the main, stow the boom crutch, raise the jib, and bear off.

50|$|Cutting devices: Sidemount divers, {{particularly}} those operating in overhead environments will carry {{two or more}} cutting devices. These should be stowed {{where they can be}} easily accessed, even when in a tight passage. Popular stowage locations include; a sheath mounted on the harness or lower arm.

50|$|Jiffy reefing, {{also called}} slab or single <b>line</b> <b>reefing,</b> is an {{alternative}} to conventional or roller reefing where the sail is folded in sections, or slabs, along the boom. One or two <b>reefing</b> <b>lines</b> reeved through the sail's luff and leach reef cringles create a new tack and clew for the sail by pulling those points tight to the boom.

40|$|A {{recently}} proposed hypothesis {{argued that}} morphologically and functionally similar macroalgae could be grouped {{to study the}} structure of macroalgal communities. It was argued that these functional groups {{can be used to}} predict changes to community composition that result from disturbance. This study examined whether the functional group model held in detecting changes in macroalgal community structure within one bioregion, by applying it to a habitat exposed to different levels of physical disturbance associated with wave exposure. Results obtained using a functional group approach were compared to those obtained using a species level approach. Three parallel <b>reef</b> <b>lines</b> in Marmion Lagoon, Western Australia, were chosen to represent three levels of exposure (high, intermediate and low) to wave-driven physical disturbance. Wave energy measurements taken simultaneously at each <b>reef</b> <b>line</b> confirmed that a gradient of physical disturbance existed. Community structure on each of the three <b>reef</b> <b>lines</b> was measured by determining the biomass and diversity of both functional groups and species at high, intermediate and low disturbance regimes. Comparisons between the two approaches were made using AN OVA of biomass data and derived diversity indices. Multivariate analysis techniques of ordination, Principal Axis Correlation (PCC) and ANOSIM (analysis of similarities) were used to detect patterns of assemblage change. The macroalgal assemblages within the target habitat were found to be highly variable, particularly within exposure levels, when examined at both the species and functional group levels. Overall, however, the functional group approach was less able to detect differences between levels of exposure. In conclusion, the use of the functional group approach is not recommended for communities displaying high spatial heterogeneity without further rigorous testing of the model. Use of the functional group approach resulted in considerable loss of information and did not account for physiological variations between all species in the one functional group. Furthermore, algal functional groups need to be more clearly defined to overcome problems of assigning species to groups that do not easily fit the model...|$|R
