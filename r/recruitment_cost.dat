40|$|Introduction: The {{availability}} of rural healthcare {{is a growing}} concern in the United States as fewer healthcare providers choose to work in rural areas. Accessing quality continuing education (CE) for rural healthcare practitioners (HCPs) remains a challenge and may pose a barrier to quality care. Methods: To maximize attendance at a live, in-person, free CE program focusing on geriatric medication and issues specifically targeted to HCPs in rural areas, two methods were implemented sequentially. The first method used formal advertising implemented by a professional marketing service to promote CE events. The second method enlisted local healthcare organizations and physician groups to promote the CE event to their employees. Cost per attendee was calculated for comparison. Results: Professional marketing services recruited 31 HCPs (March 2011) and resulted in a per-participant <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> of US$ 428. 62. Local healthcare organizations and physician groups’ marketing recruited 48 HCPs (July–August 2011) and resulted in a per-participant <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> of US$ 55. 19. Discussion: Providing free CE coordinated through local healthcare organizations and physician groups was the most cost-effective method of recruiting rural HCPs for CE. Formal advertising added cost without increasing the number of participants per event. Although this is the first study of the cost-effectiveness of recruitment methods targeting HCPs in rural areas, results are consistent with research on cost-effectiveness of outreach to rural lay community members...|$|E

This study aims to describe the recruitment process and outcomes of 2 exercise interventions conducted in Shanghai, China. MethodsRecruitment information was ascertained from 2 community-based randomized controlled trials for 2 exercise interventions, the first designed to improve health outcomes for older women with knee osteoarthritis and the second to study changes in cognitive function in adults with mild cognitive impairment. Results were summarized in terms of recruitment sources, number screened, screening-to-enrollment ratios, and costs. ResultsRecruitment was primarily achieved through working with local residential divisions (i. e., neighborhood associations and residential committees). Both studies achieved their planned target number of older adults (45 and 46, respectively) within a 1 -year time frame, with a screening-to-randomized ratio of 5 : 1 and demonstrated excellent retention rates (range 87 %– 93 %) at 6 months. The <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> for the 2 studies averaged RMB 189 (about USD 30) per initial recruit and RMB 738 (about USD 119) per participant randomized.

40|$|This paper aims to {{document}} and analyse {{the use of}} fixed-term contracts (FTC) and to analyse the dynamics of labour adjustment by type of labour contract at the firm level, drawing on the detailed breakdown of both the labour force and labour entries and exits that {{are available in the}} "Belgian Firms' Social Balance Sheets" dataset. It also aims to investigate the structure of labour adjustment costs by type of labour contract, using the methodology proposed by Goux, Maurin and Pauchet (2001). Results first indicate that flexible labour contracts are not only used to facilitate short-term labour adjustment but also as a screening device. The findings also suggest that when a firm decides to introduce flexible labour into its production process, it does also this to meet long-run objectives such as implementing minimising costs innovations. It is further estimated that the introduction of FTCs does not seem to affect the speed of indefinite-term contracts (ITC) adjustment. Our results also tend to indicate that the FTC is a key adjustment variable in response to cost shocks and to unexpected demand fluctuations while, in response to expected fluctuations in output, firms then prefer to adjust their level of permanent employment. Finally, {{and as far as the}} structure of labour adjustment costs in Belgium is concerned, the marginal <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> under an ITC represents 12. 4 % of the marginal termination cost of ITC, while the marginal cost associated with the recruitment under an FTC only accounts for 0. 8 % of its ITC counterpar...|$|E

Methods: An AA BCS who completed treatment over 1 year prior to the study was trained as a peer navigator (PN), and then paired with AA women completing primary breast cancer treatment (n= 4) for 2 months. This mixed-methods, proof of concept study utilized a convergent parallel approach to explore feasibility and investigate whether changes in scores are favorable using interviews and self-administered questionnaires. Results: Results indicate that the PN intervention was acceptable by both PN and BCS, and was feasible in outcomes of <b>recruitment,</b> <b>cost,</b> and time requirements. Improvements in symptom distress, perceived support from God, and preparedness for recovery outcomes were observed over time. Qualitative analysis revealed six themes emerging from BCS interviews: “learning to ask the right questions”, “start living life again”, “shifting my perspective”, “wanting to give back”, “home visits are powerful”, and “we both have a journey”: support from someone who has been there. Conclusion: Results support current literature indicating that AA women who have survived breast cancer can be an important source of support, knowledge, and motivation for those completing breast cancer treatment. Areas for future research include standardization of training and larger randomized trials of PN intervention. Implications for cancer survivors: The transition from breast cancer patient to survivor is a period when there can be a loss of safety net concurrent with persistent support needs. AA cancer survivors can benefit from culturally tailored support and services after treatment for breast cancer. With further testing, this PN intervention may aid in decreasing general symptom distress and increase readiness for recovery post-treatment.

40|$|Abstract Background The randomised-controlled trial (RCT) {{provides}} the best evidence for evaluating treatment effects and is accepted as a gold standard for clinical and regulatory decision making (1; 2). One of the major challenges to the conduct of RCTs is the recruitment of adequate numbers of participants. Inadequate numbers reduce {{the power of a}} study to detect statistically significant treatment effects, and may cause delays, increased costs and failure to complete trials. The need for clinical trials in children has been increasingly recognised by the scientific community, resulting in increased demands for the inclusion of children in trials. For several reasons, recruiting children to trials is more challenging than recruiting adults, as consent issues are more difficult because parents make decisions about trial participation on behalf of their child. Despite general professional and community support for paediatric clinical trials, parents and paediatricians express reluctance when their own child or patient is asked to participate. Although researchers working with children commonly experience difficulty with recruiting children to RCTs, little is known about this very important subject. The method by which potential participants are approached for trial participation, the influence of their health care provider and the attitude of potential participants (or their parents, in the case of children), are critical {{to the understanding of the}} decision making process for trial participation. This thesis is one of the first major attempts to explore the issues surrounding the recruitment of children to RCTs, and is divided into four studies which address these issues. Methods Recruitment strategies used to encourage participation in randomised controlled trials (systematic review) Eligible experimental and observational studies comparing methods of recruiting participants for RCTs were identified after a comprehensive search of Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library and reference lists. Independent data extractions were completed by two reviewers who assessed the studies for eligibility and methodological quality. Outcome measures were consent rates, proportion enrolled by each method and cost of recruitment per participant. Summary estimators of effects were calculated using a random effects model and expressed as relative risk with 95 % confidence intervals. Heterogeneity was analysed using the Q statistic. Paediatricians' attitudes to children's participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research) Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions involving 16 paediatricians and 5 trainees from a paediatric teaching hospital in Sydney was undertaken. Doctors varied in occupation, experience, research activity, age, gender, ethnicity and parenthood experience. A professional facilitator conducted the semi-structured group discussions. Recruitment ceased when informational redundancy was reached, after 4 focus groups involving 21 participants. The transcribed audiotapes were analysed by theme linkage using the constant comparative method. Australian paediatricians' and adult physicians' attitudes to randomised controlled trials (survey) A 44 -item questionnaire was sent to 250 paediatricians and 250 adult physicians randomly selected from the membership list of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians. Questions assessing doctors' treatment philosophies and attitudes to trials were compared with demographic and practice variables. Parents' attitudes to children's participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research) Qualitative analysis of focus group discussions involving 33 parents from 5 different settings (representing parents of children with a life threatening, chronic or acute illness, with experience in trials and of healthy children) was undertaken. Parents varied in age, gender, ethnicity, level of education, research experience and their child's health status. The transcribed discussions were analysed by theme linkage using the constant comparative method. Results Recruitment strategies used to encourage participation in randomised controlled trials (systematic review) Fifty papers were included (out of 8602 titles and abstracts searched) which described 8 RCTs, 2 quasi RCTs, 13 prospective cohort studies, 30 retrospective cohort studies and 2 before-after studies. These studies assessed how over 4 million people were approached for RCT participation using 87 different recruitment strategies, with 103, 406 people enrolling in RCTs. Health care provider (HCP) referrals had the highest participant consent rates at the time of exposure to trial information (HCP referral versus target mailing: relative risk (RR) 1. 84 (95 % confidence interval (95 %CI) 1. 08, 3. 13)). They also had the highest consent rates when potential participants respond to the recruitment material by further enquiry about the trial (HCP referral versus community presentation: RR 1. 37 (1. 06; 1. 78); HCP referral versus worksite approach: RR 25. 20 (20. 19, 31. 45); HCP referral versus general community approach: RR 2. 53 (0. 46, 14. 05); HCP referral versus mailing: RR 3. 29 (1. 26, 8. 60); HCP referral versus media: RR 2. 66 (1. 31, 5. 41)). However, by the time potential participants attend eligibility assessment for trial participation, no difference in consent rates could be distinguished by method of recruitment. Higher proportions of study participants were recruited by methods that exposed larger numbers of potential candidates to trial information (despite their lower consent rates). The stated <b>recruitment</b> <b>cost</b> ranged from US$ 0 to $ 1108 per participant, with mailing being the most cost-effective method and community methods (such as community presentations, pamphlets and posters displayed at community sites) the least effective. Paediatricians' attitudes to children's participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research) From the focus group discussions, paediatricians thought parents balanced perceived gains and risks when deciding about trial participation. They also believed the child's condition and parents' health beliefs and personal attributes influenced parents' decisions. Other factors thought to be important by paediatricians were the doctors' beliefs and their relationship with the investigators. Paediatricians perceived gains for trial participation including professional benefits for themselves, improved patient care, convenience for the families and themselves and scientific advancement. Perceived risks included inconvenience, inadequate resources and potential harms to the patient and the doctor-patient relationship. Paediatricians with previous research experience were most knowledgeable about RCTs and perceived greatest gains from trial participation. Paediatricians' personal treatment preferences hindered trial support. Australian paediatricians' and adult physicians' attitudes to randomised controlled trials (survey) Response rate from the paediatricians' and adult physicians' survey was 60 % (300 / 500). Australian paediatricians and adult physicians are very similar in their treatment philosophies, and are clinician-oriented rather than research-oriented in their attitudes, with primary allegiance to their patients and preference for selecting treatment rather than referring for trial participation in the face of treatment uncertainty. Professional activities are clinically focused, with limited time assigned for research. Australian doctors perceive little reward for trial participation and claim that the opinions of referring doctors regarding RCTs does not influence them. Predictors of favourable attitudes to trial participation from the survey were time allocation for research, a history of referring patients to trials in the past and younger age (all p values less than 0. 0001). Parents' attitudes to children's participation in randomised controlled trials (focus group research) When parents were interviewed, they acknowledged balancing risks and benefits when deciding about trial participation for their child. Perceived benefits include the offer of hope, better care of their child, the opportunity to access new treatments, healthcare professionals and health information, meeting others in similar circumstances and helping others. Perceived risks include potential side effects, being randomised to ineffective treatments and the inconvenience of participation. The decision for trial participation is also influenced by parental factors (parents' knowledge, beliefs and emotional response), child factors (the child's health status and preference about participation), trial factors (the use of placebos and the uncertainties of research) and doctor factors (doctor's recommendations and communication of trial information). Conclusions There are many challenges to the successful conduct of RCTs. Ways of addressing these include: using effective methods of recruiting potential study participants (such as mailing of recruitment material to potential participants) and abandoning ineffective strategies (such as community methods) : fostering greater willingness for trial participation by addressing parents' and paediatricians' concerns including enhancing communication between researchers, paediatricians and parents, and improving the gains-hazard balance (by increasing incentives while decreasing inconveniences); and reforming in the health care system to raise the priority placed on clinical research by restructuring clinical research in a clinically predominant workplace and with a clinically predominant workforce. The findings from this study have implications for researchers planning RCTs for children in the future. Careful consideration of the above will enhance RCTs participation for children improving efficiency, lowering costs and ultimately improving the future health care of children...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{competitive}} search framework by relaxing the memory loss assump-tion the search literature imposes after a separation.

Efficiency obtains with risk neutral workers since equilibrium contracts give away worker’s productivity af-ter the first production spell. With risk aversion and incomplete markets, it is too costly for firms to efficiently retain their employees because of the contractual trade-off between consumption-smoothing and reducing workers’ search intensity. This tension generates excessive search and <b>recruitment</b> <b>costs</b> making the equilibrium unemployment rate inefficiently low. One important policy conclusion is that moderate unemployment insurance yields efficiency gains not only by providing more consumption smoothing, but also by reducing unemployed workers’ search effort.

The most important task consists on modelling the semantic content of these documents using ontology. The ontology is built taking into account the most significant components of resumes inspired from the structure of EUROPASS CV. This ontology is thereafter used to annotate automatically the resumes. Comment: 9 page...|$|R
30|$|An {{additional}} benefit from training apprentices {{can be measured}} by saved future <b>recruitment</b> <b>costs</b> (Stevens 1994 b), i.e., the costs a firm faces when searching for and training workers from the external labour market until they reach full productivity. Firms frequently have to hire new workers, either to fill a vacancy or to expand their workforce. However, finding a suitable worker who matches the job profile and other possible requirements may be costly. While <b>recruitment</b> and training <b>costs</b> may depend on the general availability of skilled workers on the external labour market, long-term predictions for Europe suggest {{that there will be}} a shortage of skilled workers with intermediate skills in many countries despite the currently high unemployment rates (due to the demographic ageing of societies). Thus, apprenticeships may provide a less costly alternative for firms, reducing the need to spend time and effort to find suitable workers externally and training them for their firm-specific needs at the pay level of skilled workers.|$|R
40|$|What {{would be}} the {{financial}} implications of offering domestic partner benefits to state employees 1 in New Hampshire? Recent scholarly research and information from government agencies lead to the following findings: 1. Health insurance benefits are an important form of compensation, and employers are important sources of health care coverage. 2. Employers are increasingly offering the same health care benefits to the same-sex domestic partners of their employees as are offered to spouses of employees. 3. Health care costs for the State and local employers would increase by a small amount. 4. Some of the added cost to the State will be offset by lower spending on Medicaid and uncompensated health care, and by lower training and <b>recruitment</b> <b>costs...</b>|$|R
