40|$|The {{motion error}} of {{assembled}} bearing {{depends on the}} geometric profile of bearing components. Therefore, {{it is crucial to}} establish the relationship between geometric error of bearing components and motion error of assembled bearing, which contributes to improving the rotational accuracy of assembled bearing in the design and machining of the bearing. The main purpose of this research is to propose an accurate method for predicting the <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> inner ring based on the geometrical constraint model of cylindrical roller bearings. In the geometrical constraint model, dimension and form errors in the inner raceway, the outer raceway, and rollers are considered, and the change of contact positions between the raceways and rollers caused by geometric errors of bearing components is taken into account. This method could predict the <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> inner ring after bearing components with geometric error are assembled. In order to testify the validity of the proposed prediction method, two particular cases in which the profiles of the inner raceway are circle and ellipse are selected, and the analysis algorithms for the <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> inner ring are derived. Two analytical results obtained from the analysis algorithms validate accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed prediction method...|$|E

The aim of {{this study}} is to find the {{influence}} of cutting parameters and tools on surface roughness and dimensional deviation for better production quality in machining 0 Cr 18 Ni 12 Mo 2 Cu 2 steel. The most important parameters like cutting velocities, depth of cut and feed rate are considered. The experiments designed four types of boring tool rake angle and two types of coolant, and measured surface roughness and <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> workpiece with three acclivitous holes. The results showed that the surface integrity of workpiece obtained by 0. 16 mm/rev feed rate with rake angle of tool 25 o were superior to that obtained by the previous boring processes.

40|$|The {{demands for}} ride comfort quality in today's long haulage trucks are {{constantly}} growing. A {{part of the}} ride comfort problems are represented by internal vibrations caused by rotating mechanical parts. This thesis work focus on the vibrations generated from <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> on the wheels. These long haulage trucks travel long distances on smooth highways, with a constant speed of 90 km/h resulting in a 7 Hz oscillation. This frequency creates vibrations in the cab, {{which can be found}} annoying. To help out with the vibration diagnosis when a truck enters a mechanical workshop, this work studies methods for <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> detection using the wheel speed sensors. The main idea is to represent the varying radius signal with a sinusoid, where the calculations are based on Fourier series. The estimated <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> value is then the amplitude of the sinusoid. In addition to the detection part, the work also present results regarding how the relative phase difference between two wheels with <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> effects the lateral motion of the cab.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} uncertainty evaluation for axi-symmetric measurement machines which is compliant with GUM and PUMA methodologies. Specialized measuring machines for the inspection of axisymmetric components enable the measurement of properties such as roundness (<b>radial</b> <b>runout),</b> axial runout and coning. These machines typically consist of a rotary table {{and a number of}} contact measurement probes located on slideways. Sources of uncertainty include the probe calibration process, probe repeatability, probe alignment, geometric errors in the rotary table, the dimensional stability of the structure holding the probes and form errors in the reference hemisphere which is used to calibrate the system. The generic method is described and an evaluation of an industrial machine is described as a worked example. Type A uncertainties were obtained from a repeatability study of the probe calibration process, a repeatability study of the actual measurement process, a system stability test and an elastic deformation test. Type B uncertainties were obtained from calibration certificates and estimates. Expanded uncertainties, at 95 % confidence, were then calculated for the measurement of; <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> (1. 2 µm with a plunger probe or 1. 7 µm with a lever probe); axial runout (1. 2 µm with a plunger probe or 1. 5 µm with a lever probe); and coning/swash (0. 44 arc seconds with a plunger probe or 0. 60 arc seconds with a lever probe) ...|$|R
50|$|Contact Stylus {{technology}} utilizes a touch-probe to {{ride along}} the tire surface as it rotates. Analog instrumentation senses {{the movement of}} the probe, and records the run-out waveform. When used to measure <b>radial</b> <b>runout,</b> the stylus is fitted to a large-area paddle that can span the voids in the tread pattern. When used to measure lateral runout on the sidewall the stylus runs in a very narrow smooth track. The contact stylus method is one of the earliest technologies, and requires considerable effort to maintain its mechanical performance. The small area-of-interest in the sidewall area limits the effectiveness in discerning sidewall bulges and depressions elsewhere on the sidewall.|$|R

However, the Hunter & Fell (2003) relation, with a predicted <b>runout</b> distance <b>of</b> approximately 431  m, {{agrees with the}} modeling results and field data; therefore, {{this is the most}} suitable empirical method to describe the Gessi-Mazzalasino landslide.|$|R

50|$|Capacitive Sensors {{generate}} a dielectric field between the tire and sensor. As {{the distance between}} the tire and the sensor varies, the voltage and/or current properties of the dielectric field change. Analog circuitry is employed to measure the field changes and record the run-out waveform. Capacitive sensors have a larger area-of-interest, on the order of 10mm compared to the very narrow contact stylus method. The capacitive sensor method is one of the earliest technologies, and has proven highly reliable; however, the sensor must be positioned very close to the tire surface during measurement, so collisions between tire and sensor have led to long-term maintenance problems. In addition, some sensors are very sensitive to moisture/humidity and ended with erroneous readings. The 10mm area-of-interest also means that bulge measurement is limited to {{a small portion of the}} tire. Capacitive sensors employ void filtering to remove the effect of the voids between the tread lugs in <b>radial</b> <b>runout</b> measurement, and letter filtering to remove the effect of raised letters and ornamentation on the sidewall.|$|R
40|$|Massive rock {{avalanches}} form some of {{the largest}} landslide deposits on Earth and are major geohazards in high-relief mountains. This work reinterprets a previously reported glacial deposit in the Alai Valley of Kyrgyzstan as the result of an extremely long-runout, probably coseismic, rock avalanche from the Komansu River catchment. Total <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> the rock avalanche is ~ 28 km, {{making it one of the}} longest-runout subaerial non-volcanic rock avalanches thus far identified on Earth. This runout length appears to require a rock volume of ~ 20 km 3; however, the likely source zone in the Trans Alai range likely contained just ~ 4 km 3 of rock, and presently, the deposit has a volume of only 3 – 5 km 3; a pure rock avalanche volume of > 10 km 3 is therefore impossible, so the event was much more mobile than most non-volcanic rock avalanches. Explaining this exceptional mobility is crucial for present-day hazard analysis. There is unequivocal sedimentary evidence for intense basal fragmentation, and the deposit in the Alai Valley has prominent hummocks; these indicate a rock avalanche rather than a rock-ice avalanche origin. The event occurred 5, 000 – 11, 000 yr B. P., after the region’s glaciers had begun retreating, implying that supraglacial runout was limited. Current volume—runout relationships suggest a maximum <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> ~ 10 km for a 4 -km 3 rock avalanche. Volcanic debris avalanches, however, are more mobile than non-volcanic rock avalanches due to their much higher source water content; a rock avalanche containing a similarly high water content would require a volume of about 8 km 3 to explain the extreme <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> the Komansu event. Rock and debris avalanches can entrain large amounts <b>of</b> material during <b>runout,</b> with some doubling their initial volume. The best current explanation of the Komansu rock avalanche thus involves an initial failure of ~ 4 km 3 of rock debris, with high water content probably deriving from large glaciers on the edifice that subsequently entrained ~ 4 km 3 of valley material together with further glacial ice, resulting in a total <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> 28 km. It is as yet unclear whether glacial retreat has rendered a present-day repetition of such an event impossible...|$|R
30|$|Three rock {{avalanche}} {{case histories}} have been back-analyzed using Dan 3 D-Flex. These cases {{were selected to}} investigate two primary factors that must be considered when analyzing the <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> rock avalanches: (1) disintegration process and (2) the slide path materials. All three cases have similar volumes; however, they differ in initiation mechanism and path materials. Back-analyzing these events provides a way to quantify {{the effects of these}} factors.|$|R
50|$|The {{tire tread}} and {{sidewall}} elements undergo deformation and recovery {{as they enter}} and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as tire uniformity. Tire uniformity is characterized by radial force variation (RFV), lateral force variation (LFV) and tangential force variation. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a force variation machine {{at the end of}} the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including <b>radial</b> <b>runout,</b> lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory {{at the end of the}} manufacturing process as a quality check. In the late 1990s, Hunter Engineering introduced the GSP9700 Road Force balancer, which is equipped with a load roller similar to the force variation machine used at the factory to grade tire uniformity. This machine can find the best position for the tire on a given wheel so that the over-all assembly is as round as possible.|$|R

40|$|When {{initiation}} of DNA replication is inhibited in wild-type Escherichia coli cells by rifampin or chloramphenicol, completion of ongoing rounds <b>of</b> replication (<b>runout</b> <b>of</b> replication) leads to cells containing two, four, or eight fully replicated chromosomes, {{as measured by}} flow cytometry. In recombination-deficient recA strains, a high frequency of cells with three, five, six, or seven fully replicated chromosomes was observed in addition to cells with two, four, or eight chromosomes. recA mutants affected only in the protease-stimulating function behaved like wild-type cells. Thus, {{in the absence of}} the recombinase function of RecA protein, the frequency of productive initiations was significantly reduced compared with that in its presence. DNA degradation during <b>runout</b> <b>of</b> replication in the presence of rifampin was about 15 %. The DNA degradation necessary to account for the whole effect described above was in this range or even lower. However, a model involving selective and complete degradation of partially replicated chromosomes is considered unlikely.
