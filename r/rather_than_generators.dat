40|$|In {{neural image}} {{captioning}} systems, a recurrent neural network (RNN) is typically {{viewed as the}} primary `generation' component. This view suggests that the image features should be `injected' into the RNN. This {{is in fact the}} dominant view in the literature. Alternatively, the RNN can instead be viewed as only encoding the previously generated words. This view suggests that the RNN should only be used to encode linguistic features and that only the final representation should be `merged' with the image features at a later stage. This paper compares these two architectures.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} rewriting in journalistic discourse by examining the typical textual features of the press release, {{one of the most}} commonly used journalistic sources. Journalism has long being recognised as being based on reproductive writing practices (Jakobs 2003), as it consists, as Bell (1991 : 41) puts it, “of previously composed text reworked into text news”. In this process of rewriting, a key role is played by sources. While their use (and occasional manipulation) on the part of journalists has been variously explored in the literature, less has been done to investigate the textual features of documents specifically designed to serve as sources, most notably press releases. The paper provides a description of the characterising features of the genre of the press release, highlighting the essentially “preformulated” nature (Jacobs 1999) of these documents, i. e. the fact that their formal traits, as well as the structuring of their content, are strategically designed to facilitate reproduction. The paper concludes that while the re-use of textual material from sources is a crucial aspect of journalistic text production, care should be taken to distinguish between rewriting and uncritical textual reproduction: although recourse to the latter has been growing exponentially over the last decade due to an increasing shortening of news production cycles that has turned journalists into “processors <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>generators</b> of news” (Lewis et al. 2008 : 27) under constant pressure to continuously “churn out” (Davis 2008) stories, a renewed attention to rewriting as a key component of journalistic text production practices should be encouraged. <br /...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel framework for characterization and simulation of thermoelectric generator systems that allows accurate and efficient prediction of electric and thermal performance at steady state conditions. The simulation framework relies on regression analysis of single thermoelectric modules including voltage, current, temperatures and heat flow. A physical {{description of the}} main phenomena is included in models and enables accurate prediction of module performance over large ranges in temperature and current. Moreover it allows a system of modules electrically connected to be analyzed and used together with fluid dynamics simulations. When {{used in conjunction with}} CFD analysis it allows efficient modeling of electrical and thermal performance by simultaneous solution of the coupled equations for energy transport and thermoelectric power generation. This efficiency comes from the fact the modeling does not require full resolution as first principle simulations does. Therefore it solves the scale separation problem and allows multiphysics simulation with just a minor increase in computational power. Experimental validation on a system consisting of electrically connected modules shows excellent prediction of heat flow as well as current and voltage. Validation confirms the simulation framework allows extrapolation outside the measured operating range used when developing the models. Even under highly non-ideal conditions with reversed current, i. e. when modules operate as Peltier coolers <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>generators,</b> very reliable predictions are obtained. Results show the simulation framework captures the main physics and allows efficient and reliable predictions. The models allow physial separation of heat conduction, Peltier, Joule and Seebeck effects and the different phenomena are studied and discussed in detail for various thermal loads and electrical configurations...|$|E

40|$|Following on from {{previous}} research {{that the authors}} have undertaken around informed assent (Harcourt 2 ̆ 6 Conroy, 2005), this paper will give further consideration the notion of informed agreement to participate in relation to researching with young children. In response to a perceived the lack of focus on the informing processes, the authors will examine the development of children 2 ̆ 7 s understandings of the research process and the position young children are currently holding in research. With the research intention to invite children to take lead agency, or at least shared agency in the research process, children offer researchers opportunities to make meaning of their actions, events, places and relationships. This paper aims to create a heightened awareness of the purpose and processes of seeking informed assent from young children when attempting to undertake collaborative research projects. This holds particular weight where the research project has the intention for children to hold the lead, or shared, agency with adult researchers. Acknowledging the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCROC, 1989) and the current thinking about child as an agentic being (Danby 2 ̆ 6 Baker, 1998; Woodrow, 1999), the authors believe it is timely to create a context for professional discussion in relation to how genuine partnerships can be formed with children as research collaborators. It {{would appear that the}} process of seeking the child’s informed assent (as opposed to just their assent) to participate in the research project is critical. In concluding with a discussion about significant aspects to consider when seeking informed assent from a young child, the authors also reflect on perceived obstacles which may impede this process of collaboration. We challenge the research community to consider the possibilities and potentials of truly seeing young children as research participants, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>generators</b> of data...|$|E

Despite this, relatively little is known about the most effective treatments for these children in the primary school period. Aims: To explore the relationship between the reported practice of speech and language practitioners and the underlying rationales for the therapy that they provide. A phenomenological approach was adopted, drawing on the experiences of speech and language practitioners. Practitioners completed a questionnaire relating to their practice for a single child with receptive language impairment within the 5 - 11 age range, providing details and rationales for three recent therapy activities. The responses of 56 participants were coded. All the children described experienced marked receptive language impairments, in the main associated with expressive language difficulties and/or social communication problems. The relative homogeneity of the presenting symptoms in terms of test performance was not reflected in the highly differentiated descriptions of intervention. One of the key determinants of how therapists described their practice was the child's age. As the child develops the therapists appeared to shift from a 'skills acquisition' orientation to a 'meta-cognitive' orientation, that is they move away from teaching specific linguistic behaviours towards teaching children strategies for thinking and using their language. A third of rationales refer to explicit theories but only half of these refer to the work of specific authors.

We assessed {{the role of}} sonication of different device’s components explanted from patients with cardiac device infections (CDI). Methods: A total of 90 devices were collected (31 generators and 59 electrodes) from 31 subjects with CDI. Devices were inoculated in TSB for 24 h and cultured with traditional methods. They were also vortexed for 30 s and then sonicated for 5 min at a frequency > 20 kHz using the BactoSonic (BANDELIN electronic GmbH & Co. KG, Germany). The cell count of collected sample was performed. Results: Sonication yielded bacteria in 63 / 90 (70 %) devices compared with only 52 / 90 (57 %) of traditional culture (p= 0. 002). The concordance between the two methods was 88 %. A total of 11 strains were only detected in sonication fluid culture: 7 S. epidermidis, 1 S. hominis, 2 C. striatum, 1 Brevundimonas spp. Among generators, 27 / 31 (87 %) grew bacteria with sonication and 26 / 31 (83 %) without sonication (p= 0. 9); instead, 36 / 52 (69 %) and 26 / 52 (50 %) electrodes were positive with and without sonication, respectivel (p= 0. 004). The bacterial cell count in sonication fluid was higher than in traditional culture (34. 5 x 10 * 4 vs 16. 9 x 10 * 4 CFU/ml, p= 0. 019). However, the difference was only significant for electrodes (25 x 10 * 4 vs 12 x 10 * 4 CFU/ml, p= 0. 007) <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> for <b>generators</b> (45 x 10 * 4 vs 21 x 10 * 4 CFU/ml, p= 0. 29).

40|$|Several {{western states}} have {{considered}} developing a regulatory approach to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electric power industry, {{referred to as}} a load-based (LB) cap-and-trade scheme. A LB approach differs from the traditional source-based (SB) cap-and-trade approach in that the emission reduction obligation is placed upon Load Serving Entities (LSEs), <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> electric <b>generators.</b> The LB approach can potentially reduce the problem of emissions leakage, relative to a SB system.

MViews includes a multiple view with consistency model and free interchange between textual and graphical modes of programming.

The advantages of MViews for visual language implementation include its representation of programs and program views as graphs. This allows graph-based languages, typical of visual languages [2], to be represented naturally and graph-based semantics to be represented in the same manner. For multi-view editing, the text/graphics consistency model produces a novel and flexible method for integrating high-level graphical programming and low-level textual programming.

This clinicopathologic group includes cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, hemicrania continua and short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing/cranial autonomic features, which differ mainly as regards the duration and frequency of pain as well as response to treatment. These disorders are not as rare as they {{were thought to be}} and due to the severity of the pain can substantially affect the patients’ quality of life. Many other forms of primary headaches, such as migraine, trigeminal neuralgia and primary stabbing headache, as well as secondary headaches, particularly those caused by pituitary, posterior fossa, orbital, paranasal sinus and vascular pathology, need to be carefully considered in the diagnosis of trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias.

At any one anatomical site, be it a fiber tract (e. g. trapezoid body) or a nucleus (e. g. medial nucleus of the trapezoid body), the modal latency of the onset discharge of the units encountered corresponded in time with the latencies of several different waves (waves P 2 -P 5) of the auditory brainstem response (ABR). Moreover, at the time of occurrence of just one of the ABR waves, single units in several diverse anatomical sites in and around the superior olive were found with modal latencies of onset discharge at that same time period. The slopes of the latency/intensity functions for both the peaks of the ABR and the modal latency of the onset discharge for most of the single units studied in the superior olive and its adjacent fiber tracts were remarkably similar.

40|$|Scaling laws {{relating}} storm {{electrical generator}} power (and hence lightning flash rate) to charge transport velocity and storm geometry were originally posed by Vonnegut (1963). These laws were later simplified to yield simple parameterizations for lightning based upon cloud top height, with separate parameterizations derived over land and ocean.

The implications of assuming that flash rate is set by the electrical <b>generator</b> power, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> the electrical <b>generator</b> current, are examined. The two approaches yield significantly different predictions about the dependence of charge transfer per flash on storm dimensions, which should be empirically testable. The two approaches also differ significantly in their explanation of regional variability in lightning observations...|$|R
5000|$|Increased {{corrosion}} potential - Following operation or testing, dry-pipe sprinkler system piping is drained, but residual water collects in piping low spots, and moisture is also {{retained in the}} atmosphere within the piping. This moisture, coupled with the oxygen available in the compressed air in the piping, increases internal pipe corrosion, eventually leading to pin-hole leaks or other piping failures. The internal corrosion rate in wet pipe systems (in which the piping is constantly full of water) is much lower, {{as the amount of}} oxygen available for the corrosion process is lower. Corrosion can be combated by using copper or stainless steel pipe which is less susceptible to corrosion, or by using dry nitrogen gas to pressurize the system, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> air. Nitrogen <b>generators</b> {{can be used as a}} permanent source of nitrogen gas, which is beneficial because dry pipe sprinkler systems require an uninterrupted supply of supervisory gas. These additional precautions can increase the up-front cost of the system, but will help prevent system failure, increased maintenance costs, and premature need for system replacement in the future.|$|R
