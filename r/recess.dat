40|$|During summer, a {{large number}} of air-conditioners at the same time could be rejecting {{condenser}} heat into a <b>recessed</b> space formed by the external walls outside many high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong. Prediction of the temperature and flow field of a powerful rising hot air stream formed in a 30 -story high <b>recessed</b> space is performed by using FLUENT 5. 0, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. For a 30 -story high <b>recessed</b> space of "I" type with four window-type air-conditioner units per story, this paper describes the findings for two depths of the <b>recessed</b> space. For the buoyant air stream, the results show that the mass-flow rate and temperature inside the <b>recessed</b> space are not significantly influenced by the <b>recessed</b> space depth. For air streams used by the condenser units, deeper <b>recessed</b> space yields an increase in the enthalpy in the air stream used by the outer units, and a decrease in the enthalpy in the air stream used by the inner units, which draw the hottest air from the <b>recessed</b> space.

40|$|In this article, {{a linear}} dynamic {{characteristic}} {{model of the}} <b>recessed</b> chamber in a gas–liquid shear coaxial injector is developed. The gaseous injector flow before the <b>recessed</b> chamber {{is considered to be}} steady, and we just investigate the response of pressure drop across the <b>recessed</b> chamber to the mass flow rate fluctuation of the liquid injector. The transfer function of the <b>recessed</b> chamber is obtained, considering the distribute characteristics of liquid droplets within the <b>recessed</b> chamber. The results show that the amplitude of pressure drop pulsation would decrease as the liquid flow pulsation frequency increases, when the variation of liquid velocity is not taken into account. While considering the variation of liquid velocity, the result is opposite. The amplitude of pressure drop oscillation on the boundary of the <b>recessed</b> chamber increases with the increase in liquid velocity oscillation frequency...|$|R

5|$|Whether counsel are {{appointed}} or retained, the Clause protects {{the role of}} counsel and certain attributes of the attorney-client relationship.

Further, the court may not prevent a defendant from consulting with her counsel during an overnight <b>recess,</b> even if the <b>recess</b> bisects direct- and cross-examination of the defendant.

40|$|Copper {{electrodeposition}} in fine <b>recesses</b> {{requires the}} use of several additives to induce a strongly accelerated deposition rate inside <b>recesses.</b> This leads to so-called bottom-up filling for fine <b>recesses,</b> induced by curvature-enhanced accelerator coverage. Here we show that more of the additives are incorporated in the deposit when this mechanism is active by studying the impurity concentrations with time-of-flight scanning ion mass spectroscopy in specially prepared samples with a high density of <b>recesses.</b> The undesired higher copper resistivity for small dimensions, induced by this incorporation, results in a reduction of the expected surface-scattering induced deviation from Matthiessen's rule.

50|$|Surfaces {{can be made}} {{hydrophobic}} {{without the}} use of coating through the altering of their surface microscopic contours, as well. The basis of hydrophobicity is the creation of <b>recessed</b> areas on a surface whose wetting expends more energy than bridging the <b>recesses</b> expends. This so-called Wenzel-effect surface or lotus effect surface has less contact area by an amount proportional to the <b>recessed</b> area, giving it a high contact angle. The <b>recessed</b> surface has a proportionately diminished attraction foreign liquids or solids and permanently stays cleaner. This has been effectively used for roofs and curtain walls of structures that benefit from low or no maintenance.|$|R

40|$|Installation {{of exposed}} fire {{sprinklers}} may cause inconvenience {{in areas where}} architectural and interior presentation is significant. In order to overcome this inconvenience, <b>recessed</b> and concealed sprinklers were created and are applied widely. Response Time Index (RTI) and C-factor are the thermal sensitivity (intrinsic parameters) used to characterise a sprinkler. They are also used as input parameters in computer fire models to simulate sprinkler response time. However, the RTI and C-factor are not published by the manufactures. Therefore the RTI and C-factor of the <b>recessed</b> and concealed sprinklers have been analysed and determined in this research. In order to obtain the RTI of the <b>recessed</b> and concealed sprinklers, four {{of the most commonly}} used sprinkler models (two <b>recessed</b> and two concealed) in New Zealand have been investigated in plunge test experiment by using a wind tunnel in this research. The UC 3 wind tunnel used to conduct the plunge test has been fabricated in this research. This work has demonstrated that the UC 3 wind tunnel could provide a very stable and uniform temperature profile in the test section. However, the velocity uniformity of the tunnel needs to be improved in the future. The "apparent" RTI for different <b>recessed</b> and concealed sprinkler models (two <b>recessed</b> and two concealed) have been determined in the plunge test experiment. It {{should be noted that the}} "final calculated RTI" for each tested <b>recessed</b> and concealed sprinklers has been denoted as "apparent RTI" in this study. BRANZFIRE computer model has been used to model the fire scenarios in the full scale fire tests conducted by Bill and Heskestad (1995). The best input fire object location, the best input sprinkler distance below the ceiling and the input "apparent C-factor" in BRANZFIRE for the flush, <b>recessed,</b> concealed and the <b>recessed</b> sidewall sprinklers have been determined in this research. This work has generally improved the guidance available to fire safety engineers for the RTI and C-factor of the <b>recessed</b> and concealed sprinklers...|$|R
