40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{study the}} {{swelling}} behavior of finlike polymer line gratings supported on a rigid substrate {{and show that}} the edge-supported polymer laminae undergo a <b>rippling</b> <b>instability</b> with a well-defined ripple wavelength λ transverse to {{the plane of the}} solid supporting substrate and a ripple amplitude that monotonically decreases from its maximum at the free-edge. These ripple patterns develop due to inhomogeneous compressive strains that arise from the geometric constraints that progressively suppress swelling near the supporting substrate where the laminae are clamped. By experimentally examining the influence of swelling strain and pattern geometry on the observed <b>rippling</b> <b>instability,</b> we find that the ripple wavelength λ scales with line width w for sufficiently long gratings, which is consistent with a simple theory. These trends were validated for polymer nanoline test patterns having w between (50 to 250) nm and a height-to-width aspect-ratio in the range 0. 5 to 5. Our results suggest that line geometry, rather than material properties, governs the onset of rippling and suggest simple rules for their control...|$|R

The short-wavelength linear perturbations of the postshock gas are analyzed assuming isothermality. Effects which are important at longer wavelengths are included by analogy with the thin shell case.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{vibrational}} properties of graphene under combined shear and uniaxial tensile strain using density-functional perturbation theory. Shear strain always causes <b>rippling</b> <b>instabilities</b> with strain-dependent direction and wavelength; armchair strain contrasts this instability, enabling graphene stability {{in a large}} range of combined strains. A complementary description based on membrane elasticity theory nicely clarifies the competition of shear-induced instability and uniaxial tension. We also report the large strain-induced shifts of the split components of the G optical phonon line, which {{may serve as a}} shear diagnostic. As to the electronic properties, we find that conical intersections move away from the Brillouin zone border under strain, and they tend to coalesce at large strains, making the opening of gaps difficult to assess. By a detailed search, we find that even at large strains, only small gaps in the tens-of-meV range open at the former Dirac points. Comment: 6 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
40|$|Small-scale (less than 15 km {{horizontal}} wavelength) wavelike structures {{known as}} ripples {{are a common}} occurrence in OH airglow images. Recent case studies attribute their origin {{to the presence of}} either convective or dynamical instabilities. However, little is known about their frequency of occurrence and period. The Maui-MALT Observatory, located at Mt. Haleakala, is instrumented with a Na wind/temperature lidar, which allows the determination of whether the atmosphere is dynamically or convectively unstable, and a fast OH airglow camera which takes images every 3 s with a sensitivity high enough to see the ripples. This study reports on 2 months of observations in October/November 2003 and in August 2004, eight nights of which also included Na lidar measurements. The imager results suggest that instability features occur in the 85 - to 90 -km region of the atmosphere for around 20 % of the time. The nominal observed period for the ripples is between 2 and 4 min. While there are clear night-to-night variations, the average observed period is similar for both the 2003 and 2004 observations. In addition, a few of the small-scale structures are not <b>ripples</b> caused by <b>instabilities</b> but rather have features consistent with their being short horizontal wavelength evanescent waves.

The presented analysis, based on the dual-input describing function method and the theoretical framework of Kepler's problem, shows an equivalence between the computation of switching instants of the PWM and the eccentric anomaly of the planet orbit around the sun, giving a simple stability criterion and a sufficient condition for the absence of solutions of the harmonic balance equation and, therefore, the probable absence of limit cycles of a period of a multiple of that characteristic of the modulator. The derived stability criterion, by using the describing function method, is successively compared with the local stability of the closed-loop PWM system for first- and second-order plants. In the first case it has been formally proved that the proposed criterion ensures the local stability of an equilibrium point, while in the second one a Monte Carlo simulation has confirmed that the selection of the modulator parameters, according to the proposed criterion, gives an effective method to avoid limit cycles and to ensure the local stability...|$|R
40|$|Efforts to {{modulate}} the electronic properties of atomically thin crystalline nanoribbons requires precise {{control over their}} morphology. Here, we perform atomistic simulations on freestanding graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) to first identify the minimal shapes, and then employ a core-edge framework based on classical plate theory to quantify the width dependence in more general systems. The elastic edge-edge interactions force ultra-narrow ribbons to be flat, which then bifurcate to twisted and bent shapes at critical widths that vary inversely with edge stress. Compressive edge stresses results in twisted and saddle shapes that are energetically indistinguishable {{in the vicinity of}} the bifurcation. Increasing widths favor the saddle shapes with (longitudinal) ribbon curvatures that vary non-linearly with width and edge stress. Positive edge stresses result in a flat-to-curled transition with similar scalings.

40|$|We {{theoretically}} {{study the}} topography of a biphasic surfactant monolayer {{in the vicinity}} of domain boundaries. The differing elastic properties of the two phases generally lead to a nonflat topography of ``mesas'', where domains of one phase are elevated with respect to the other phase. The mesas are steep but low, having heights of up to 10 nm. As the monolayer is laterally compressed, the mesas develop overhangs and eventually become unstable at a surface tension of about K(dc) ^ 2 (dc being the difference in spontaneous curvature and K a bending modulus). In addition, the boundary is found to undergo a topography-induced <b>rippling</b> <b>instability</b> upon compression, if its line tension is smaller than about K(dc). The effect of diffuse boundaries on these features and the topographic behavior near a critical point are also examined. We discuss the relevance of our findings to several experimental observations related to surfactant monolayers: (i) small topographic features recently found near domain boundaries; (ii) folding behavior observed in mixed phospholipid monolayers and model lung surfactants; (iii) roughening of domain boundaries seen under lateral compression; (iv) the absence of biphasic structures in tensionless surfactant films.

40|$|Kinneyia are a {{class of}} microbially {{mediated}} sedimentary fossils. Characterised by clearly defined ripple structures, Kinneyia are generally found in areas that were formally littoral habitats and covered by microbial mats. To date {{there has been no}} conclusive explanation of the processes involved in the formation of these fossils. Microbial mats behave like viscoelastic fluids. We propose that the key mechanism involved in the formation of Kinneyia is a Kelvin-Helmholtz type instability induced in a viscoelastic film under flowing water. A ripple corrugation is spontaneously induced in the film and grows in amplitude over time. Theoretical predictions show that the <b>ripple</b> <b>instability</b> has a wavelength proportional to the thickness of the film. Experiments carried out using viscoelastic films confirm this prediction. The ripple pattern that forms has a wavelength roughly three times the thickness of the film. This behaviour is independent of the viscosity of the film and the flow conditions. Laboratory-analogue Kinneyia were formed via the sedimentation of glass beads, which preferentially deposit in the troughs of the ripples. Well-ordered patterns form, with both honeycomb-like and parallel ridges being observed, depending on the flow speed. These patterns correspond well with those found in Kinneyia, with similar morphologies, wavelengths and amplitudes being observed. Comment: 16 pages, 8 figures, accepted for publication in Phil.

40|$|Part I Generation of Sand Ripples by Surface Waves In Chapter 1, {{we study}} the sand <b>ripple</b> <b>instability</b> under {{partially}} standing surface waves in constant water depth. For gently sloped ripples, the approximate flow field is· worked out. By invoking an empirical formula of sediment transport rate, an eigenvalue problem is obtained, which {{gives rise to}} the equation for initial ripple growth with coefficients depending on local wave conditions. It is found that the wave-induced steady streaming has no effect on ripple growth. Thus, <b>ripple</b> <b>instability</b> is locally similar to the cases for oscillatory flows and for purely progressive waves, and is driven by ripple-induced flow. But the intensity of this process varies spatially with the period of half the surface wavelength due to the reflection. The results show that beneath the envelope minima (nodes) ripples grow the fastest and are the longest; under the envelope maxima (antinodes) ripples are unlikely. Part II Generation of Sand Bars and Sediment/Wave Interaction In this part we study the formation mechanism of sand bars under reflected surface waves and the mutual influence of the waves and bars through Bragg resonance. In Chapter 2, we first give an analysis of the effects of shoreline reflection on Bragg resonance by considering rigid bars, aiming at acquiring {{a deeper understanding of the}} physical processes of the Bragg resonance mechanism. We show that finite reflection by the shoreline can increase the wave energy arriving at the shore, in contrast to the result from most previous studies, suggesting that the mechanism can enhance the attack of the incident sea on the beach. The phase relation of the rigid bars and the shoreline reflection is found to be a key to the qualitative change of wave response. In Chapter 3, we develop a quantitative theory to describe the formation mechanism of sand bars by coupling sediment dynamics and wave hydrodynamics. Assuming that the slopes of waves and bars are comparably gentle and sediment motion is dominated by the bedload, an approximate evolution equation of bar height is derived. This equation shows that sand bars grow and evolve via a forced diffusion process rather than instability. Both the forcing and diffusivity depend on the flow field above the current bed. In Chapter 4, the coupled evolution of sand bars and waves is investigated, in which the Bragg scattering mechanism has been understood as two concurrent physical processes: energy transfer between two wave-trains propagating in opposite directions and change of their wavelength. Both effects are found to be controlled locally by the position of bar crests relative to wave nodes. In the absence of shoreline reflection, it is found that pre-existing sand bars cannot be maintained by their own Bragg scattered waves and the formation of sand bars offshore by Bragg scattering is at best a transient phenomenon. Comparison with experimental data supports the description of bar formation as a forced diffusion process. In Chapter 5, we examine the effects of horizontal variation of eddy viscosity on the evolution of bars. This variability arises because (1) the intensity of wave oscillation at the bottom changes in space due to the reflection; (2) the bottom roughness is not uniform due to the formation of ripples. While the forced diffusion mechanism is not changed qualitatively, it is found that the variable turbulent intensity inside the wave boundary layer strongly enhances the spatial fluctuation of the sand flux induced by wave stresses, thus causes stronger forcing to the bar growth. by Jie Yu.

40|$|Experimental {{results are}} {{reported}} on non-stationary evolution and interactions of waves forming on water and water-glycerol solution flowing along an inclined plane. A nonlinear wave generation process {{leads to a}} large number of solitary humps {{with a wide variety of}} sizes. A fluorescence imaging method is applied to capture the evolution of film height in space and time with accuracy of a few microns. Coalescence - the inelastic interaction of solitary waves resulting in a single hump - is found to proceed at a timescale correlated to the difference in height between the interacting waves. The correlation indicates that waves of similar height do not merge. Transient phenomena accompanying coalescence are reported. The front-running ripples recede during coalescence, only to reappear when the new hump recovers its teardrop shape. The tail of the resulting solitary wave develops an elevated substrate relative to the front, which decays exponentially in time; both observations about the tail confirm theoretical predictions. In experiments with water, the elevated back substrate is unstable, yielding to a tail oscillation with wavelength similar to that of the front-running <b>ripples.</b> This <b>instability</b> plays a key role in two complex interaction phenomena observed: the nucleation of a new crest between two interacting solitary humps and the splitting of a large hump (that has grown through multiple coalescence events) into solitary waves of similar size...|$|R
40|$|Utilizing {{analyses}} of observational data, {{we performed a}} detailed study to investigate short-period atmospheric gravity waves and <b>ripples,</b> and <b>instabilities</b> in the mesopause region. Recent coordinated measurements from Haleakala Observatory, Maui, HI via airglow wave imaging, meteor wind radar, and Na wind temperature lidar have provided a unique dataset for this study. Gravity waves generated in the lower atmosphere propagate energy upwards into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere region where they modulate the airglow emissions, and later break and deposit their momentum, causing significant perturbations in winds and temperatures. Ripples, on the other hand, are likely generated by localized shear instabilities in the background wind eld, and are also observed frequently in airglow images. First, we investigated the frequency of occurrence and climatology of ripples and their seasonal variation in propagation directions of motion. These novel results were then used to characterize {{the nature of the}} observed ripples and to identify individual Kelvin Helmholtz instability events as their sources, which were consistent with theoretical computations. The results provided insight to better quantify seasonal wave anisotropy and instability dynamics in the mesopause. Second, we investigated ground-relative and intrinsic properties of gravity waves that were Doppler-ducted or evanescent. The results were then compared with an analytical model and numerical model simulations for the Doppler-ducted and evanescent waves, demonstrating signicant dierences in wave structures for apparently similar wave events. Results reinforced the need to better understand the dynamics of wave ducting and their importance for momentum and energy transports at upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere heights. Third, we investigated the frequency of occurrence of frontal disturbances and the appearance of complementary intensities in OH and O 2 airglow emissions. We have analyzed ducting conditions of mesospheric bores. One bore event was trapped in a stable Doppler duct arising from wind structure, and other bore events were trapped within thermal inversion layers. Analysis confirmed that the measured ducted bore events were separately consistent with theoretical Doppler-ducted and thermal-ducted wave characteristics.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extension}} of the author's recent research in which only buck converters were analyzed. Similar analysis can be equally applied to other types of converters. In this paper, a unified model is proposed for buck, boost, and buck-boost converters under peak or average current mode control to predict the occurrence of subharmonic oscillation. Based on the unified model, the associated stability conditions are derived in closed forms. The same stability condition can be applied to buck, boost, and buck-boost converters. Based on the closed-form conditions, the effects of various converter parameters including the compensator poles and zeros on the stability can be clearly seen, and these parameters can be consolidated into a few ones. High-order compensators such as type-II and PI compensators are considered. Some new plots are also proposed for design purpose to avoid the instability. The instability is found to be associated with large crossover frequency. A conservative stability condition, agreed with the past research, is derived. The effect of the voltage loop <b>ripple</b> on the <b>instability</b> is also analyzed.

40|$|Magnetic beads {{are very}} useful for {{purification}} steps in biotechnology {{as well as}} for certain micro-manipulation experiments in biophysics. The “superparamagnetic beads” commercially available are suitable for most of these applications due to their high magnetic load (typically 50 weight %), their good monodispersity in sizes (from 200 nm to a few µm) and the control of their surface coating (typically amino or carboxy moities, but also antibodies for the grafting of biomolecules). However in the field of drug-delivery, there is a strong demand of magnetic multi-responsive objects, i. e. carriers of drugs that would respond to at least two different stimuli: temperature, pH, solute concentration, [...] ., combined to the long distance action of a magnetic field. Contrary to the well documented studies on magnetic beads made of surfactant coated magnetic nanoparticles embedded in polymer shells, we chose to explore the route of hydrogel microparticles combined with ionic ferrofluids. Being highly swollen by water, these magnetic microgels exhibit a softness that leads to their fast response to the solvent quality and to certain shape instabilities. Preparation We have published recently the preparation of magnetic microgels and minigels from the polymerization of the neutral hydrophilic monomer acrylamide (AM) cross-linked by N,N'-methylene-bisacrylamide (BAM) in an inverse (W/O) emulsion. After dispersing in oil an aqueous ferrofluid and a polymerization mixture localized together in water droplets, we achieve free radical polymerization, followed by rinsing steps. We obtain spherical particles made of a hydrophilic polymer matrix entrapping magnetic nanoparticles with a high encapsulation yield and a homogeneous dispersion state. By preparing either a conventional emulsion or a mini-emulsion, we reach two ranges of sizes: either microgels of 2 – 20 µm diameters visible by optical microscopy or sub-micron minigels, which in addition present a good colloidal stability. Due to their magnetic load, microgels and minigels both react to a field by chaining and to a field gradient by migration (magnetophoresis).

Due to their magnetic load, microgels and minigels both react to a field by chaining and to a field gradient by migration (magnetophoresis). Swelling degree and dynamics The initially liquid droplets are efficiently converted to gel beads. The most direct evidence is to show their ability to absorb a good solvent (water), by following their volume increase compared to a bad solvent (ethanol) or to the dry state. The amount of water at the swelling equilibrium results from a balance between the free energy of mixing (of polymer and water) and the elastic constraints on the network. The degree of swelling is thus expected to be reduced by increasing the cross-linking density, as we check by looking at microgels containing either 2. 5 or 5 weight % of BA compared to AM. The observation of magnetic microgels during swelling under the optical microscope shows: the penetration of the water front towards the dry core; the overall increase of the outer diameter; the spreading onto the glass slide (i. e. the decrease of the contact angle); and sometimes also a transient <b>rippling</b> <b>instability</b> of the free surface, that T. Tanaka has shown a long time ago with macroscopic hydrogels. The quantitative analysis of the volume increase of a given bead from optical observations is difficult due to those phenomena at the gel/glass and gel/solution interfaces. On the contrary, minigels are properly dispersed in the medium and their average diameter is in the right range to be measured by multi-angle dynamic light scattering. The hydrodynamic diameter varies indeed from 158 nm in ethanol to 195 nm in water, which corresponds to almost a two fold increase of volume (on average) when the beads are transferred from a bad to a good solvent. Concerning now dynamics, we know that swelling is a diffusive process, and thus its characteristic time scale varies like the inverse of the bead diameter. Therefore it take only a few seconds for microgels around 10 µm in size to change their size, while it takes hours for beads in the mm range (or even days for cm large gels). Sub-micron minigels change their volume in even shorter times, which makes them quite interesting for multi-responsive biomedical carriers. Shape instabilities Even if there is an analogy between a microgel wetting a flat surface or squeezed between two plates and a pure viscous liquid droplet in the same situations, there are also noticeable differences due to the elastic nature of the gel. It has been predicted theoretically that the shape of a soft elastic bead on an adhesive substrate is not a perfect spherical cap as a liquid droplet. More precisely, the wedge makes an extension, which typical size L is the ratio of the spreading parameter (S≡ 10 - 2 J/m) by the shear modulus of the network (G≡ 104 Pa for soft elastomers). Using several microscopies (SEM, TEM, AFM, optical microscopy) and either hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates, we show that such “feet” exist around the magnetic microgels, and that their length is about 1 µm and becomes longer when the gel is softer (at lower BA/AM ratio). When we look at a microgel drying slowly in a thin cell made of two glass slides, we observe the well known Saffman-Taylor instability due to penetration of air and retraction of fluid. However, the dried microgel exhibits a more branched structure of the gel “fingers” compared to pure viscous fingering, as was previously observed for a visco-elastic gel. Conclusion and perspectives We prepare magnetic gels in two ranges of sizes. Being colored by the iron oxide, the larger microgels can be easily handled under an optical microscope equipped with magnets. They can serve as model systems for shape instabilities of soft elastic objects during swelling, wetting or drying. The sub-micron microgels are intended for biotechnological applications. We plan to improve them by incorporating a polymer like poly(NIPAM), with a volume transition as a function of temperature. T. Tanaka T, S. -T. Sun, Y. Hirokawa, S. Katayama, J. Kucera Y. Hirose, T.
