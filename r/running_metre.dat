40|$|What {{traces of}} their actions are the Building Corporations in Sweden leaving in their {{archives}} and are they followingsome archival policies? This thesis is trying to answer that question. For that reason 25 archives fromSwedish Building Corporations have been investigated concerning their size, contents and age. Furthermore apoll performed by the Swedish National Archives {{in cooperation with the}} Swedish Employers’ Confederationhas been analyzed. As a complement to these investigations some people responsible for the archives at SwedishBuilding corporations have been interviewed about their companies’ archival policies. The result of this study is, sadly enough, that the Swedish Building Corporations are neglecting their archives. Most of the archives that were studied are very small, less than half a <b>running</b> <b>metre.</b> A few builders of thegeneration born {{in the late nineteenth century}} have left more or less extensive archives, but they were very poorlyorganized. But generally the will to build up archives for the need of the future researchers and for the culturalheritage seems to be very poor in the Building Corporations, even poorer than in the Swedish companies in general. Almost no archival strategies could be discerned, other than that most companies preserve their record onlyfor that time the law and their own immediate needs prescribe. That is a shame, concerning the Building Corporations’importance for the cultural heritage in that that the buildings they are making are forming our culturalenvironment. This is a two years master’s thesis in Archival Science...|$|E
