5000|$|Goods {{traffic was}} at a peak during the interwar period, when the sidings saw a variety of {{interesting}} traffic. Horseboxes and cattle wagons were numerous, and during the war, it was a stabling point for an emergency tank train. A large banana <b>ripening</b> <b>shed</b> was opened in the late 1950s and this received supplies direct from Avonmouth Docks. This closed on 1 October 1971 as bananas were now containerised and transported by road. Race traffic has also decreased and the track layout was progressively simplified, leaving the remaining traffic {{to be dealt with}} by strengthening ordinary services. Further modifications were carried out in 1972 when the station was [...] "modernised" [...] by demolishing the goods shed and removing the down platform canopy. However, the main buildings, together with the adjoining stationmaster's house, have survived as good examples of an LBSCR country station.|$|E
40|$|Ethylene {{has long}} been known to be a {{critical}} signal controlling the ripening of climacteric fruits; however, the signaling mechanism underlying ethylene production during fruit development is unknown. Here, we report that two FERONIA-like receptor kinases (FERLs) regulate fruit ripening by modulating ethylene production in the climacteric fruit, apple (Malus×domestica). Bioinformatic analysis indicated that the apple genome contains 14 members of the FER family (MdFERL 1 – 17), of these 17 FERLs, MdFERL 6 was expressed at the highest level in fruit. Heterologous expression of MdFERL 6 or MdFERL 1, the apple homolog of Arabidopsis FER, in another climacteric fruit, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit delayed ripening and suppressed ethylene production. Overexpression and antisense expression of MdFERL 6 in apple fruit calli inhibited and promoted ethylene production, respectively. Additionally, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of SlFERL 1, the tomato homolog of FER, promoted tomato fruit ripening and ethylene production. Both MdFERL 6 and MdFERL 1 physically interacted with MdSAMS (S-adenosylmethionine synthase), a key enzyme in the ethylene biosynthesis pathway. MdFERL 6 was expressed at high levels during early fruit development, but dramatically declined when fruit ripening commenced, implying that MdFERL 6 might limit ethylene production prior to fruit development and the ethylene production burst during fruit ripening. These results indicate that FERLs regulate apple and tomato fruit <b>ripening,</b> <b>shedding</b> light on the molecular mechanisms underlying ripening in climacteric fruit...|$|R
40|$|After fruit {{development}} is triggered by pollination, the abscission zone (AZ) in the fruit pedicel strengthens its adhesion {{to keep the}} fruit attached. We previously reported that xyloglucan and arabinan accumulation in the AZ accompanies the shedding of unpollinated flowers. After the fruit has developed and is fully <b>ripened,</b> <b>shedding</b> occurs easily in the AZ due to lignin accumulation. Regulation of cell wall metabolism may {{play an important role}} in these processes, but it is not well understood. In the present report, we used immunohistochemistry to visualize changes in the distributions of xyloglucan and arabinan metabolism-related enzymes in the AZs of pollinated and unpollinated flowers, and in ripened fruits. During floral abscission, we observed a gradual increase in polyclonal antibody labeling of expansin in the AZ. The intensities of LM 6 and LM 15 labeling of arabinan and xyloglucan, respectively, also increased. However, during floral abscission, we observed a large 1 day post anthesis (DPA) peak in the polyclonal antibody labeling of XTH in the AZ, which then decreased. These results suggest that expansin and XTH play important, but different roles in the floral abscission process. During fruit abscission, unlike during floral abscission, no AZ-specific expansin and XTH were observed. Although lignification was seen in the AZ of over-ripe fruit pedicels, secondary cell wall-specific cellulose synthase signals were not observed. This suggests that cellulose metabolism-related enzymes do not play important roles in the AZ prior to fruit abscission...|$|R
40|$|Auxin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} phytohormones regulating many aspects of fleshy fruit development including fruit set, fruit size through the control of cell division and cell expansion, and fruit <b>ripening.</b> To <b>shed</b> light on the role of auxin fruit ripening, we have previously shown that Sl-ARF 4 is a major player in mediating the auxin control of sugar metabolism in tomato fruit (cv MicroTom). Further extending this study, we show here that down-regulation of Sl-ARF 4 in tomato alters some ripening-related fruit quality traits including enhanced fruit density at mature stage, increased firmness, prolonged shelf-life and reduced water (weight) loss at red ripe stage. These findings suggest that Sl-ARF 4 plays a role in determining fruit cell wall architecture and thus providing a potential genetic marker for improving post-harvest handling and shelf life of tomato fruits...|$|R
50|$|The flower is an annual, {{occasionally}} reaching 0.5 m by 0.3 m. In some climates it {{flowers from}} July to October. In its native habitat of the highlands of central Mexico, blooms are produced from September to killing frost. Achenes <b>ripen</b> and are <b>shed</b> {{within two weeks}} of the start of bloom. The heads contain mostly hermaphrodite (having both male and female organs) florets and are pollinated primarily by beetles in the wild, as well as by tachinid flies and other insects. The leaves of all species of marigold include oil glands. The oils are pungent.|$|R
40|$|In {{majority}} of the marine fishes from tropical areas, maturation is a continuous process resulting in the occurrence of mature fishes throughout the year. In several Indian marine fishes, because of multiple spawning, a truly spent fish is scarcely found and also difficult to identify. Instead, partially spent fishes {{have been reported in}} a number of cases. As the eggs contained in the ovary are progressively <b>ripened</b> and <b>shed,</b> the ovary itself grows smaller, and to the naked eye, seems to reverse the stages by which it attained fuji maturity. The ovaries of such fi shes, though superficially resemble the normal stages III to V, differ from them in macroscopic appearance as well as microscopic structure to some extent. It occurred to the authors that such partially spent ovaries of fishes yield clues to the frequency or spawning in different species. In the present paper, the occurrence and nature of such ovaries and their relation to the frequency of spawning in two species of ribbon-fishes and a sciaenid have been discussed with supporting evidence from data on other fishes...|$|R
40|$|The genus Trematolobelia (Lobeliaceae) is {{endemic to}} the Hawaiian Islands. It resembles Lobelia, except for its {{peculiar}} dehiscence. On <b>ripening</b> the capsules <b>shed</b> their epidermis and soft mesocarp, exposing the outer bony endocarp which is pierced by numerous holes. On the exposed ridges or cliff faces, the slender stem is whipped {{back and forth}} by the wind. Centrifugal force ejects the seeds through the holes of the endocarp. This monograph presents nine species and three varieties of the genus, five on Hawaii, two on Oahu and Molokai, and one each on Kauai, Lanai, east Maui, and west Maui.

40|$|In Malaysia, {{oil palm}} {{is the main}} {{commodity}} crop and has strongly contributed to the country’s economic development. However, the industry is facing several challenges including diminishing land resource for expansion. One of the targets to ensure oil palm sustainability is to increase yield per unit area without affecting its quality and with minimal impact to the environment. The non-synchronized <b>ripening</b> process and <b>shedding</b> of the fruits is among the factors that limit yield improvement and affect oil quality. Thus, {{the present study was}} conducted to deepen our understanding of the changes that occur within the fresh fruit bunch (FFB) during fruit development. This work also takes into account the various fruit positions (inner, middle and outer) and locations (apical, central and basal) within the bunch. In the present study, physiological, biochemical and molecular analyses were performed using fruits from various stages of fruit development. Physiological and biochemical analyses included measurements of carotenoid, FAC (fatty acid composition) and ethylene production. UV-Vis spectrophotometer, gas chromatography mass spectrophotometry (GCMS) and GC equipped with flame ionization detector (FID) were used to estimate and quantify the β-carotene content, FAC and ethylene production from the fruit mesocarp from young until the ripening stages. Results showed that changes in the β-carotene content, FAC and ethylene production throughout the fruit developmental stages from young until ripening were significant (p< 0. 001). Both accumulation of the β-carotene and ethylene production increased as the fruits developed and reached the maximum at the ripest stage used in this study. Similarly, changes in the FAC was observed especially in palmitic, oleic, stearic and linoleic acid throughout the fruit developmental process where the level of oleic acid was found to be the highest in the ripest fruit stage used in this study, surpassing that of palmitic acid. In the present study, it was also observed that fruit positioned within the spikelets throughout the bunch at the various fruit developmental stage from young until ripening showed significant changes (p< 0. 001) in the β-carotene content and FAC. For β-carotene, the outer fruits have the highest content while the inner fruits have the least. For FAC, palmitic and stearic acids were higher in the outer fruits as compared to the inner fruits while the levels of oleic and linoleic acids were in contrast to that of palmitic and stearic. The inner fruits also recorded higher iodine value (IV) than the outer fruits. Ethylene production in the ripe bunch was not influenced by the fruit location or position within the bunch. Thus, the molecular mechanism of ethylene perception during fruit developmental processes, including ripening and abscission were investigated. In the present study, {{with the use of the}} oil palm genome sequence data, the oil palm ethylene receptor family which comprised of seven putative ethylene receptors including three splice variants were identified. In addition, combination of in silico bioinformatics tools and laboratory bench work also resulted in the successful isolation and characterisation of the putative ethylene receptor genes and their corresponding promoters. The putative regulatory motifs in the promoters provide a means to understand the possible mechanisms that drive the expression of the ethylene receptor genes. Expression analyses of the ethylene receptors in various oil palm tissues suggest multiple roles of the ethylene receptors in regulating many processes in oil palm which includes fruit development and fruit abscission. Subsequently, the effect of gene(s) that influence oil quality was also investigated in this study. The full-length FLL 1 gene encoding a lipase class 3 and its corresponding promoter were successfully isolated and characterised. FLL 1 was expressed highly in the mesocarp tissues and at various developmental stages and at a much higher expression in the cold induced ripe fruits. Promoter analysis via transient expression assay using GUS as the reporter gene showed that the GUS expression in the mesocarp slices was targeted especially to the vascular bundles. Southern analysis of the FLL 1 gene revealed the gene to belong to a multigene family. With the availability of the oil palm genome sequence data, sixty-two predicted proteins with identities ranging from 26 to 83...|$|R
