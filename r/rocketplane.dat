2500|$|Rocket Racer - The EZ-Rocket program led to {{a second}} <b>rocketplane</b> design for the Rocket Racing League. [...] It was built on a Velocity SE {{airframe}} and later {{became known as the}} Mark-I X-Racer. [...] It was powered by an XCOR regeneratively cooled and pump-fed XR-4K14 rocket engine. [...] This rocket-powered aircraft flew several demonstration flights at the 2008 EAA AirVenture Oshkosh air show. [...] The total thrust for the single-engine Mark-I X-Racer has been variously reported as [...] to , approximately twice that of the EZ-Rocket initial prototype. [...] The engine uses pressure-fed LOX and pump-fed kerosene, a combination that allows the fuel to be stored in the airplane's wing tanks while avoiding potential complications with pumping liquid oxygen. [...] After flight testing of the X-Racer was completed in 2008, XCOR completed seven <b>rocketplane</b> flights in one day.|$|E

25|$|As well {{as these}} components, rockets can have {{any number of}} other components, such as wings (<b>rocketplanes),</b> parachutes, wheels (rocket cars), even, in a sense, a person (rocket belt).

50|$|CALT is also {{planning}} two spaceplanes. They {{would both}} be single-stage to space sub-orbital <b>rocketplanes.</b> One {{would be a}} 10-ton 4-passenger plane that would fly to 100 km at Mach 6. The other would be a 100-ton 20-passenger plane that would fly to 130 km at Mach 8. They would be equipped with liquid methane/liquid oxygen rocket engines. The larger spaceplane would {{also be able to}} carry a strap-on space rocket, making it function as the first stage of a two-stage to orbit space launch platform. That rocket would launch above the Karman line, and lift 1-2 tons to LEO.|$|R
50|$|In February 2006, Kistler was {{purchased}} by the majority owner of <b>Rocketplane</b> Limited, Inc, a competing reusable, private spacecraft firm. Kistler Aerospace continued to operate until its closure under the name <b>Rocketplane</b> Kistler. Meanwhile <b>Rocketplane</b> Limited, Inc. {{changed its name to}} <b>Rocketplane</b> Global, Inc., with a third company, <b>Rocketplane,</b> Inc. set up as a parent company for the two.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, <b>Rocketplane</b> Limited, Inc. was formed. Pioneer <b>Rocketplane</b> is a {{part owner}} of <b>Rocketplane</b> Limited, but ceased {{operations}} as an independent company. <b>Rocketplane</b> Limited purchased the intellectual property of Pioneer and put in place an all new management and engineering team to push {{the development of the}} <b>Rocketplane</b> XP.

5000|$|<b>Rocketplane</b> Inc., {{along with}} its subsidiaries, <b>Rocketplane</b> Kistler and <b>Rocketplane</b> Global, failed to deliver on {{promises}} to Oklahomans and—financially broke—left the state in 2009.

The company closed its Oklahoma City headquarters and relinquished its hangar at Burns Flat." ...|$|E
50|$|Projected {{to be an}} {{hour and}} one half in length, the races were {{intended}} to be between Rocket Racer planes that used liquid oxygen and either kerosene or ethanol fuel with a burn time of four minutes. The <b>rocketplanes</b> were expected to cost less than US$1 million each. The planes {{were based on the}} fixed-gear Velocity SE modified by XCOR Aerospace and the retractible gear Velocity XL modified by Armadillo Aerospace for the purpose of rocket racing. The Velocity airframe was derived from a commercially available kit plane that traced its design heritage to the Rutan Long-EZ, which had been modified to accept rocket power and custom avionics. In order to provide the airframes, RRL purchased the aircraft's manufacturer, Velocity Aircraft, in April 2008.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} five years, he flew {{nearly all of the}} {{experimental}} aircraft under test at Edwards, including the X-1, XF-92, X-4, X-5, Douglas D-558-I Skystreak and the Douglas D-558-II Skyrocket. During one of his X-1 flights, the cockpit windows completely frosted and Crossfield was literally flying blind. Ever resourceful, he removed a loafer, took off his sock, and created a peep hole to reference his chase plane wingman all the way to landing. On November 20, 1953, he became the first person to fly at twice the speed of sound as he piloted the Skyrocket to a speed of 1,291 mph (2,078 km/h, Mach 2.005). The Skyrocket D-558-II surpassed its intended design speed by 25 percent on that day. With 99 flights in the rocket-powered X-1 and D-558-II, Crossfield had — by a wide margin — more experience with <b>rocketplanes</b> than any other pilot in the world by the time he left Edwards to join North American Aviation in 1955.|$|R
50|$|In February 2009, <b>Rocketplane</b> vacated its Oklahoma City {{headquarters}} building.
