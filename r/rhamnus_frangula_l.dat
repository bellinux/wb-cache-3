40|$|This paper {{investigated}} {{the potential for}} the exotic shrub <b>Rhamnus</b> <b>frangula</b> <b>L.</b> (glossy buckthorn) to alter native plant community composition in southeastern New Hampshire. Stratified random sampling was performed with 2 m x 2 m plots randomly located in 5 m intervals along three 50 m transects in four even-aged Pinus-mixed hardwood forests, three of which were managed stands. The associations between R. frangula and the measured species abundances and environmental variables were investigated using linear, least-squares multiple regression and Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling Ordination. Plot basal area of R. frangula was inversely related to woody seedling density (p 3 ̆c 0. 001), herb cover (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), and species richness (p 3 ̆c 0. 01). The relative contribution of R. frangula to explaining variance in seedling density was greater than canopy openness, soil pH, soil clay, or soil sand. Abundance of R. frangula was a statistically significant predictor (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) of individual herb species abundances for all study sites. This evidence supports the hypothesis that R. frangula causes a decline in seedling density and alters native ground level plant species abundances. Furthermore, the patterns agree with the suppression of ground level plant species abundances by R. frangula found in removal experiments...|$|E
40|$|We tested, {{the ability}} of the simple reaction-diffusion spread model to {{quantify}} the rate of spread of <b>Rhamnus</b> <b>frangula</b> <b>L.,</b> a non-indigenous shrub, at the scale of a single forest stand in southeastern New Hampshire. Cut stems of R. frangula were collected in a Cartesian grid pattern within the invaded stand and aged. A contour map of the invasion pattern was produced using kriging. The empirical invasion rate was calculated as the linear distance per year since initial invasion. The intrinsic rate of increase and diffusion coefficient were estimated in the field and the model prediction calculated. Observed mean rate of linear expansion was measured to be 6. 7 in per year {{with a standard deviation of}} 1. 24 m per year, while the predicted linear asymptotic rate of spread was calculated be 6. 3 m per year. Thus, the simple reaction-diffusion model yielded a very accurate prediction of actual spread rate. There may have been a lag-phase in the invasion at this site as the spread rate was found to be slower in the early stages of invasion compared to later stages. At the scale of single stands, the simple reaction-diffusion model may be accurate enough to predict the spread of new invaders without recourse to complex life-history spread rate models. Additionally, if lag-phases in spread rate occur with regular frequency, then attempts to retrospectively predict which species may be invasive will be hampered by incorrectly classifying a future invader as currently non-invasive.

40|$|Non-native, {{invasive}} plants often exhibit high photosynthesis {{and growth}} rates relative to native species. Growth in open environments typically varies inversely with understory survival, however. Do invasive and native species achieve growth by similar means? Are they subject to similar trade-offs between growth and survival? We compared photosynthesis, growth, and survival of two invasive trees (Acer platanoides and Ailanthus altissima) and two invasive shrubs (<b>Rhamnus</b> <b>frangula</b> <b>L.</b> = Frangula alnus Miller and Elaeagnus umbellata), each {{paired with a}} native species of similar life form and shade tolerance. Seedlings were planted in the field, with and without exclosures, in open and understory environments. ^ Invaders exhibited greater light-saturated photosynthesis (Pmax) and leaf N concentration than natives, and greater plasticity in leaf N across environments. Net assimilation rates (NAR) in the open were greater in invaders and closely correlated with Pmax. The high NAR of invaders did not produce more rapid growth, however, because invasive shrubs had lower leaf area and leaf biomass ratios than natives. Natives and invaders thus achieved similar growth rates, but by different means. ^ In general, similar trade-offs constrained native and invasive species. Growth in the open was negatively correlated with understory survival, but this relationship did not differ between natives and invaders. The effects of herbivory on growth and survival were not consistently greater in natives, although the invader E. umbellata was notably unaffected by browsing. Invaders exhibited greater Pmax than natives of similar dark respiration or leaf N in the understory, {{but not in the}} open. ^ In our initial experiment, leaf N and leaf mass per area were inversely correlated among species, but often positively correlated across canopy treatments within species, implying that intraspecific plasticity may not be subject to the same trade-offs as interspecific adaptation. In further experiments, we measured leaf-level responses to nitrogen manipulation within existing populations of R. frangula. In contrast with interspecific patterns, leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf longevity increased with leaf N in the open, and were uncorrelated with leaf N in the understory. Thus, acclimation within this species differed qualitatively from interspecific patterns of adaptation to N availability. ...|$|E

40|$|To {{determine}} the extent of antiviral activity present in a number of plant extracts, hot glycerin extracts were prepared from Rheum officinale, Aloe barbadensis, <b>Rhamnus</b> <b>frangula,</b> <b>Rhamnus</b> purshianus, and Cassia angustifolia and their virucidal effects were tested against herpes simplex virus type 1. All the plant extracts inactivated the virus. The active components in these plants were separated by thin-layer chromatography and identified as anthraquinones. A purified sample of aloe emodin was prepared from aloin, and its effects on the infectivity of herpes simplex virus type 1 and type 2, varicella-zoster virus, pseudorabies virus, influenza virus, adenovirus, and rhinovirus were tested by mixing virus with dilutions of aloe emodin for 15 min at 37 degrees C, immediately diluting the sample, and assaying the amount of infectious virus remaining in the sample. The results showed that aloe emodin inactivated all of the viruses tested except adenovirus and rhinovirus. Electron microscopic examination of anthraquinone-treated herpes simplex virus demonstrated that the envelopes were partially disrupted.
