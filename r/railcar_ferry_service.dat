2500|$|Sackville grew in {{importance}} as a railway junction after Canadian National Railways established a dedicated <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>service</b> at Cape Tormentine in 1917. [...] The Sackville railway yard and station were constantly busy until {{the opening of}} publicly funded highways following World War II started a slow decline. [...] The abandonment of the Prince Edward Island Railway in 1989 saw the line to Cape Tormentine removed {{at the same time}} as the Trans-Canada Highway was being expanded to a 4-lane freeway. [...] As the railway consolidated to a single mainline running through town, businesses left, including offices of Atlantic Wholesalers.|$|E
2500|$|In 1890, the ICR {{completed}} {{construction of}} what had begun as the Cape Breton Eastern Extension Railway, with a line running from its former NSR terminus at New Glasgow eastward through Antigonish to the port of Mulgrave where a <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>service</b> was instituted over a [...] route across the deep waters of the Strait of Canso to Point Tupper. The line then headed east across the centre of Cape Breton Island, crossing the Bras d'Or Lake on the newly built Grand Narrows Bridge, continuing to the port of North Sydney (with ferry and steamship connections to Port aux Basques, Newfoundland) and terminating in the burgeoning industrial centre and port of Sydney.|$|E

50|$|The M&NS was re-chartered {{under the}} federal {{government}} in 1900 to connect Sudbury with Little Current on Manitoulin Island. From there the line was to run to the southern end of Manitoulin Island and via a <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry</b> to Tobermory and on to Meaford, Wiarton and Owen Sound. In October 1913 the line reached Little Current on Manitoulin Island {{with the opening of the}} Little Current Swing Bridge; it would never extend further to the southern end of the island, nor the <b>ferry</b> <b>service</b> to the Bruce Peninsula and connection to Owen Sound.|$|R
50|$|Despite these changes, Terra Transport {{was unable}} {{to turn a profit}} for CN and the federal government. Specialized ferries were still needed for {{carrying}} non-LCL railway cars, and by the mid-1980s were approaching the end of their operational life and required replacement. The election of a Conservative federal government brought about the elimination of subsidies for money-losing operations. In 1986, one of two remaining <b>railcar</b> <b>ferries</b> was sold off as the government converted CN Marine into Marine Atlantic, completely separating the rail and <b>ferry</b> <b>services.</b> Terra Transport operations were largely captive on the island and would specialize in handling import/export LCL and inter-island non-LCL freight.|$|R
2500|$|Grand Trunk Western was one {{of three}} Michigan railroads, along with the Ann Arbor Railroad and Pere Marquette Railway, that {{operated}} separate <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>service</b> across Lake Michigan between Michigan and Wisconsin. Loading rail cars onto ships that had rails mounted to their decks, and ferrying the cars east and west across Lake Michigan, allowed railroads to bypass the congested rail interchanges in Chicago and move time sensitive freight more quickly. GTW's ferry service was originally operated by the former Detroit, Grand Haven and Milwaukee Railway (DGH) which Grand Trunk Railway acquired in 1882. [...] DGH initially had agreements with ferry companies operating on Lake Michigan to transfer its passengers and freight onto ships bound for Milwaukee form Grand Haven, Michigan. GTW's rail car ferry service began in 1902 with an operating agreement with the steamship company, Crosby Transportation Company. The railway constructed ferry slip docks at Grand Haven and Milwaukee and had two steamships built, the SS Grand Haven and SS Milwaukee, capable of carrying 26 freight railcars. In 1905 Grand Trunk assumed Crosby's interest and incorporated the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company to operate the ships. [...] In Milwaukee GTW interchanged rail cars with The Milwaukee Road, Chicago and North Western and the Soo Line. The ownership of the ferry company was shared with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) from 1927 until 1954 and sailed as the Grand Trunk-Pennsylvania Route. The SS Milwaukee sank loaded with rail cars in a storm after departing Milwaukee in October 1929 with everyone aboard lost. [...] Three new ships, the Grand Rapids, Madison, and the City of Milwaukee constructed between 1926 and 1931, replaced the Grand Haven and Milwaukee. The ships required a crew of 34 and with strengthen ice breaking hauls operated year round. On PRR's request GTW moved its Michigan docks to Muskegon in 1937 where its subsidiary the Muskegon Railway and Navigation Company initially operated ferry loading and switching operations. GTW had also changed its route into Muskegon with trackage rights over PRR's line from Grand Rapids. [...] By 1968 GTW was shipping over [...] of freight a year across Lake Michigan. However, the ferry service began running deficits of over $1 million annually in the 1970s and in 1975 GTW petitioned the ICC to end the service. Permission was eventually granted and the last ferry sailed on October 31, 1978.|$|E
50|$|Compagnie de gestion de Matane Inc.

50|$|The late 1960s saw a {{temporary}} relief vessel, the MV Lucy Maude Montgomery, enter service for several years, {{along with a}} much larger and mor powerful icebreaking <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry,</b> the MV John Hamilton Gray, which entered service in 1968, retiring the SS Prince Edward Island after a record 51 years of service. New docks were constructed and more permanent vessels for the <b>ferry</b> <b>service</b> were ordered. In 1971 the sister ships MV Holiday Island and MV Vacationland entered service, and Borden processed record traffic on its ferry system in the lead-up to PEI's centennial year in 1973, after which the MV Confederation and MV Lucy Maude Montgomery were reassigned to other services and left Borden permanently.|$|R
50|$|The CPR {{acquired}} several smaller railways via long-term leases in 1912. On 3 January 1912, the CPR {{acquired the}} Dominion Atlantic Railway, a railway {{that ran in}} western Nova Scotia. This acquisition gave the CPR a connection to Halifax, a significant port on the Atlantic Ocean. The Dominion Atlantic was isolated {{from the rest of}} the CPR network and used the CNR to facilitate interchange; the DAR also operated <b>ferry</b> <b>services</b> across the Bay of Fundy for passengers and cargo (but not rail cars) from the port of Digby, Nova Scotia, to the CPR at Saint John, New Brunswick. DAR steamships also provided connections for passengers and cargo between Yarmouth, Boston and New York. On 1 July 1912, the CPR acquired the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway, a railway on Vancouver Island that connected to the CPR using a <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry.</b> The CPR acquired the Quebec Central Railway on 14 December 1912.|$|R
50|$|It {{came under}} the control of the Canadian Government Railways in 1914 and was then {{operated}} by the Intercolonial Railway until that railway was taken over by Canadian National.

25|$|CN {{made major}} capital improvements, {{upgrading}} the main line, bridges, and rolling stock, and replacing steam locomotives with diesel units. Additional improvements {{were made to}} the <b>ferry</b> <b>service,</b> with new vessels and an expanded terminal at Port aux Basques. An additional indirect service improvement to the Newfoundland railway operations was made in 1955, {{with the opening of the}} Canso Causeway, linking Cape Breton Island with mainland North America and removing the need to <b>ferry</b> <b>railcars</b> destined for Newfoundland across the Strait of Canso.|$|R

The company offered six of its ferries for sale in June 1961, citing the fact that [...] "trade had dwindled to the vanishing point" [...] and service ceased in August 1961.|$|E
50|$|In 1931, another vessel, the SS Charlottetown, {{joined the}} SS Prince Edward Island in {{handling}} the increased rail and road traffic using the ferry service. Most workers for CNR's ferry and railway yard in Borden {{lived in the}} town. After {{the loss of the}} SS Charlottetown in 1941, the now-elderly SS Prince Edward Island remained the only dedicated vessel on the ferry service through the remainder of the Second World War, aside from brief relief service by the SS Scotia or SS Scotia II from the Strait of Canso <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the Trans-Canada Highway was {{completed}} across Newfoundland in 1965, trucks took {{most of its}} freight service {{in the same year}} as CN instituted the first <b>railcar</b> <b>ferry</b> <b>service</b> to the island. Standard-gauge cars had their trucks switched to narrow gauge for movement on the island. Interchange with the North American system did not improve the traffic levels and even the CNR started to move its own freight increasingly by truck. The death knell came for both the Newfoundland and P.E.I. Railways in 1987 when Canada deregulated its railway industry and allowed railways to abandon money-losing lines.|$|E
