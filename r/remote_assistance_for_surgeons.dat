40|$|Abstract. Most of the {{teachers}} in higher education consider the act of teaching/learning engineering as more than individual study and online assessment. The education process in engineering means theory and practice, individual study or experimental work that involves equipments, simulation/emulation software packages and laboratory applications. The traditional e-learning platforms consist of the learning management system, learning content management system, assessment and communication modules (especially forum and messaging). The third generation of e-learning platforms provides with advanced services such as online courses, tutorials and webinars. In order to develop e-learning platforms for higher education, especially engineering, new methodologies {{should be taken into}} consideration: project- and problem based learning, virtual laboratory (remote access to laboratory equipments and applications and task evaluation) or <b>remote</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> diploma projects and mobility grants.

40|$|Abstract — Recent {{advances}} in small-scale flapping-wing micro aerial vehicles have extended {{the capabilities of}} flight control {{for a number of}} applications, such as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance activities. In this work, we demonstrate autonomous flight control of a 13 gram ornithopter capable of flying toward a target without <b>remote</b> <b>assistance.</b> <b>For</b> autonomous flight control, we developed 1. 0 gram control electronics integrated with a microcontroller, inertial and visual sensors, communication electronics, and motor drivers. We also developed a simplified aerodynamic model of ornithopter flight to reduce the order of the control system. With the aerodynamic model and the orientation estimation from on-board inertial sensors, we present flight control of an ornithopter capable of flying toward a target using onboard sensing and computation only. To this end, we developed a dead-reckoning algorithm to recover from the temporary loss of the target which can occur with a visual sensor with a narrow field of view. As a result, the 28 cm wing-span ornithopter flying toward a target landed within a radius of 0. 5 m from the target with more than 85 % success (N = 20). I...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA {{significant}} recent {{breakthrough in}} medical imaging {{is the development}} of a new non-invasive modality based on multispectral and hyperspectral imaging that can be easily integrated in the operating room. This technology consists of collecting series of images at wavelength intervals of only few nanometers and in which single pixels have spectral information content relevant to the scene under observation. Before becoming of practical interest for the clinician, such system should meet important requirements. Firstly, it should enable real reflectance measurements and high quality images to dispose of valuable physical data after spatial and spectral calibration. Secondly, quick band pass scanning and a smart interface are needed for intra-operative mode. Finally, experimentation is required to develop expert knowledge for hyperspectral image interpretation and result display on RGB screens, to assist the surgeon with tissue detection and diagnostic capabilities during an intervention. This paper is focused mainly on the two first specifications of this methodology applied to a liquid crystal tunable filter (LCTF) based visible and near infrared spectral imaging system. The system consists of an illumination unit and a spectral imager that includes a monochrome camera, two LCTFs and a fixed focal lens. It also involves a computer with the data acquisition software. The system can capture hyperspectral images in the spectral range of 400 - 1100 nm. Results of preclinical experiments indicated that anatomical tissues can be distinguished especially in near infrared bands. This promises a great capability of hyperspectral imaging to bring efficient <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> <b>surgeons...</b>|$|R

40|$|YCT 2007 The next {{generation}} computing will be human-centered, which weaves computation and communication technologies into the background of people’s working and living spaces, and changes the interactions between human and computers into implicit mode. In this regard, computers analyze people’s actions and intentions based on multi-modal sensor data, and further provide attentive services to them without drawing their attention away from their current tasks. In our work, we perform online analysis of people’s actions and intentions based on multiple audio-visual sensors distributed in the physical spaces, where people have no need to wear any sensors. Understanding of current context is the key technology of implicit HCI, which includes two major mechanisms: event detection, and context-aware computing. We present a dynamic context model based framework to integrate these two mechanisms together, which bridges the gap between low-level sensor data and high-level semantic understanding effectively. Our framework can provide attentive services to people based on the computer’s automatic understanding of people’s states, actions and interactions. Attentive services include meeting assistant <b>for</b> the <b>remote</b> participants, <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> the distributed cooperative work, house surveillance and <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> the elderly people, and automatic archiving of people’s daily life in their working or living spaces. ...|$|R

40|$|Most of {{the world}} {{countries}} are challenged with a large ageing population who {{spend most of their}} time at home and are mostly sedentary (8. 5 hours per day as of today). Sedentary behavior and physical inactivity affect the social, physical and mental states of people leading to social isolation and physical declines and hence an ideal candidate for chronic and degenerative diseases. To maintain an active aging process (healthy state of physical, mental and social wellbeing), regular and daily exercising is necessary. However, many older adults do not maintain regular exercising due to poor health, lack of company, lack of motivation, lack of transportation and suitable outdoor facilities. In this context, home based physical exercises can help people maintain their physical activity and ICT can act as a key player and facilitator by providing interactive training applications (through desktops and mobile devices), self-monitoring (using activity trackers and wearables) and automated coaching (using rule-based systems or <b>remote</b> <b>assistance).</b> Yet, <b>for</b> many people and, in particular, the sedentary older population at home; even with the existence of the technology, there is not enough motivation to maintain a regular exercising routine. Thus, this thesis aims to investigate the IT-mediated persuasive strategies that help independent-living older adults at home to maintain a regular exercising lifestyle. In particular, this research examines the effect of social inclusion and group exercising on the motivation of trainees at home to adhere to the training program which has proven to be effective...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{learning}} curve for robotic partial nephrectomy was investigated for an experienced laparoscopic surgeon and {{factors associated with}} warm ischemia time (WIT) were assessed. Materials and Methods: Between 2007 and 2014, one surgeon completed 171 procedures. Operative time, blood loss, complications and ischemia time were examined to determine the {{learning curve}}. The learning curve {{was defined as the}} number of procedures needed to reach the targeted goal for WIT, which most recently was 20 min. Statistical analyses including multivariable regression analysis and matching were performed. Results: Comparing the first 30 to the last 30 patients, mean ischemia time (23. 0 - 15. 2 min, P < 0. 01) decreased while tumor size (2. 4 - 3. 4 cm, P = 0. 02) and nephrometry score (5. 9 - 7. 0, P = 0. 02) increased. Body mass index (P = 0. 87), age (P = 0. 38), complication rate (P = 0. 16), operating time (P = 0. 78) and estimated blood loss (P = 0. 98) did not change. Decreases in ischemia time corresponded with revised goals in 2011 and early vascular unclamping with the omission of cortical renorrhaphy in selected patients. A multivariable analysis found nephrometry score, tumor diameter, cortical renorrhaphy and year of surgery to be significant predictors of WIT. Conclusions: Adoption of robotic <b>assistance</b> <b>for</b> a <b>surgeon</b> experienced with laparoscopic surgery was associated with low complication rates even during the initial cases of robot-assisted partial nephrectomy. Ischemia time decreased while no significant changes in blood loss, operating time or complications were seen. The largest decrease in ischemia time was associated with adopting evidence-based goals and new techniques, and was not felt to be related to a learning curve...|$|R
