40|$|Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (MOS) {{structures}} containing 74 Ge nanocrystals (NC-Ge) imbedded {{inside the}} SiO_ 2 layer were studied for their capacitance characterization. Ge atoms were introduced by implantation of 74 Ge+ ions with energy of 150 keV into relatively thick (~ 640 nm) amorphous SiO_ 2 films. The experimental characterization included room temperature measurements of capacitance-voltage (C-V) dependences at high frequencies (100 kHz and 1 MHz). Four groups of MOS structures have been studied: The 1 st - "initial" samples, without Ge atoms (before ion implantation). The 2 nd - "implanted" samples, after Ge+ ion implantation but before annealing, with randomly distributed Ge atoms within the struggle layer. The 3 rd - samples after formation of Ge nanocrystals {{by means of}} annealing at 800 degree C ("NC-Ge" samples), and the 4 th - "final" samples: NC-Ge samples that were subjected by an intensive neutron irradiation in a research nuclear reactor with the integral dose up to 10 ^ 20 neutrons/cm^ 2 followed by the annealing of radiation damage. It is shown that in "initial" samples, the C-V characteristics have a step-like form of "S-shape", which is typical for MOS structures {{in the case of}} high frequency. However, in "implanted" and "NC-Ge" samples, C-V characteristics have "U-shape" despite the high frequency operation, In addition, "NC-Ge" samples exhibit a large hysteresis which may indicate charge trapping at the NC-Ge.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study attempts to provide empirical data which will show how {{and to what}} extent specific styles of leadership may maximize the performance and <b>retention</b> of <b>units</b> within the Navy. The study focuses upon a sample of twenty comparable destroyers and frigates within the Pacific Fleet. Leadership-style data were collected from the first and second officers in command of these units (CO and XO) by means of Fleishman's Leadership Opinion Questionnaire (LOQ), a self administering inventory which measures two important dimensions of leadership behaviors consideration, relating to the leader's degree of socio-emotional emphasis; and structure, relating to the leader's degree of task-related emphasis. These leadership-style data were compared with six measures of unit effectiveness: overall mission readiness (OVL), personnel readiness (PER), supply readiness (S'JP), equipment readiness (EQP), training readiness (TNG). and retention (RET). These measures were collected for a six month period in which the CO and XO of each unit had functioned as a "dual leadership" team. The results {{of this study indicate that}} the CO either tends to perform both the task-related and socio-emotional functions, or the CO and XO appear to divide these functions, with the CO performing the socio-emotional function, and the XO performing the task-related function. The results also indicate that the leadership styles of the CO and XO appear to exert the most influence upon overall mission readiness and <b>retention,</b> while <b>unit</b> training readiness appears to be unrelated to the leadership style of either the GO or XO. More specifically, the task-related emphasis of both the CO and XO was found to have a significant positive correlation with overall unit readiness. Further analysis indicated that the GO'S task-related emphasis has a significant positive correlation with unit personnel readiness, while the task-related emphasis of the XC has a significant positive correlation with both unit supply and equipment readiness. Finally, the socio-emotional emphasis of the CO, and to a lesser extent the XO, was found to have a significant positive correlation with <b>unit</b> <b>retention.</b> These results suggest that units are likely to be most effective with respect to performance and retention when the first and second in command are high in both the socio-emotional and task-related dimensions.

40|$|Recent {{findings}} {{have shown that}} microbial nitrogen flow and digestible energy of diets are increased when urea is combined with a slow-release urea (SRU) in diets with a starch to acid detergent fibre ratio (S:F) 4 : 1. This affect is attributable to enhanced synchrony between ruminal N availability for microbial growth and carbohydrate degradation. To verify {{the magnitude of this}} effects on lamb performance, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of combining urea and a SRU in diets containing S:F ratios of 3 : 1, 4 : 1, or 5 : 1 on performance, dietary energetics and carcass characteristics of finishing lambs. For that, 40 Pelibuey×Katahdin lambs (36. 65 ± 3 kg) were assigned to one of five weight groupings in 20 pens (5 repetition/treatments). The S:F ratio in the diet was manipulated by partially replacing the corn grain and dried distiller’s grain with solubles by forage (wheat straw) and soybean meal to reach S:F ratios of 3 : 1, 4 : 1 or 5 : 1. An additional treatment of 4 : 1 S:F ratio with 0. 8 % urea as the sole source of non-protein nitrogen was used as a reference for comparing the effect of urea combination vs. conventional urea at the same S:F ratio. There were no treatment effects on dry matter intake (DMI). Compared the urea combination vs urea at the same S:F ratio, urea combination increased (p< 0. 01) average daily gain (ADG, 18. 3 %), gain for feed (G:F, 9. 5 %), and apparent energy <b>retention</b> per <b>unit</b> DMI (8. 2 %). Irrespective of the S:F ratio, the urea combination improved the observed-to-expected dietary ratio and apparent <b>retention</b> per <b>unit</b> DMI was maximal (quadratic effect, p≤ 0. 03) at an S:F ratio of 4 : 1, while the conventional urea treatment did not modify the observed-to-expected net energy ratio nor the apparent <b>retention</b> per <b>unit</b> DMI at 4 : 1 S:F ratio. Urea combination group tended (3. 8 %, p = 0. 08) to have heavier carcasses with no effects on the rest of carcass characteristics. As S:F ratio increased, ADG, G:F, dietary net energy, carcass weight, dressing percentage and longissimus thoracis (LM) area increased linearly (p≤ 0. 02). Combining urea and a slow-release urea product results in positive effects on growth performance and dietary energetics, but the best responses are apparently observed when there is a certain proportion (S:F ratio = 4 : 1) of starch to acid detergent fibre in the diet...|$|R

In {{a few cases}} where space was limited, we adjusted the angle of transects (using a random azimuth) to accommodate their lengths within plot and grove boundaries. We centered a 3.5 m radius (38.5 m 2) regeneration plot on the centermost giant sequoia seedling, sapling, or small tree within the plot in order to evaluate associations between the centralized giant sequoia regeneration class and measured stand and soil variables. In each regeneration plot, we counted the number of giant sequoia small seedlings and small diameter (< 30 cm dbh) trees (which includes saplings). We also recorded regeneration of other conifer species and hardwoods. Each regeneration plot yielded a total sample area of 962.5 m 2 per treatment (in each grove) or 0.192 ha per grove (0.289 ha for Black Mountain Grove; 0.869 ha total in all groves). We divided regeneration plots into quadrants, and individuals of giant sequoia and other conifers were counted by size class: 5 cm to 50 cm in height (termed “small seedlings”), 50 cm to 140 cm (“large seedlings”), and > 140 cm tall and < 30 cm dbh (“small trees,” which includes saplings) (Brohman and Bryant 2005). We measured the tallest seedling of each tree species in each quadrant. We chose 30 cm dbh as the cutoff diameter for older giant sequoia regeneration in our study because no giant sequoias < 30 cm dbh were retained following harvest within <b>retention</b> harvest <b>units</b> of Bearskin and Black Mountain groves. Additionally, a dbh of 29.5 cm was the largest diameter of giant sequoia regeneration recorded within the <b>retention</b> harvest <b>units</b> of Bearskin and Black Mountain groves and the high-severity wildfire area of Redwood Mountain grove.|$|R

Two shelterwood silvicultural treatments were designed to replicate as well as enhance the existing multi-aged stand structure on the Tenderfoot Creek Experimental Forest in central Montana: the fi rst, with reserve trees evenly distributed; the second, with reserves contained within small (1 / 10 - 1 / 4 acre) groups. Retention of reserve trees was targeted at 50 %, without regard to diameter or species. Eight even distribution and eight group-retention treatments were applied on 16 units totaling 649 acres. Half of the units were broadcast burned following harvest using a common burn prescription on all units. Allowable overstory mortality specifi ed in the prescribed fi re plan was 50 %. Plot-based fuel inventories and fi re effects observations were performed at permanent plot locations prior to and following harvest, and after burning. Fuel moisture samples were acquired immediately prior to ignition. Data from four prescribed-burned treatment units were evaluated for this paper: two even-retention units and two grouped <b>retention</b> <b>units.</b> Harvest activities resulted in signifi cant increases in fi ne-fuel loading (1 -, 10 -, and 100 -hour fuel), which was subsequently reduced by prescribed fi re to near pre-harvest levels. Consumption of large woody fuel was similar for both treatment types. The fi re-induced mortality of overstory trees was greater in the even distribution than in the grouped distribu-tion. Despite careful execution of a relatively conservative burn plan, mortality in the even treatments exceeded the prescription threshold of 50 % by an additional 28 %. Additional data collected at the plots include trees per acre, residual tree mortality, residual tree growth, regeneration, windthrow, hydrologic responses, soil impacts, and beetle activity. A comprehensive summary of the treatments will follow subsequent monitoring scheduled to occur fi ve and ten years after burning...|$|R

This range of release rates allows for {{a better understanding of the}} possible uncertainties in estimating internal loading in Spring Lake, as opposed to simply measuring maximum (i. e. linear) release rates. Phosphorus flux was calculated using the following equation: Pflux = (Ct – C 0) * V/A, [1] where, Pflux is the net P flux or <b>retention</b> per <b>unit</b> surface area of sediments (mg P m- 2 d- 1), Ct is the P concentration in the water column at time t, C 0 is the P concentration in the water column at time 0, V is the volume of water in the water column, and A is the area of the sediment surface. Internal load for the lake was calculated by scaling up the mean P flux from the anaerobic and aerobic treatment condition as calculated in equation [1] to the entire lake area. Because data were not available for the percent of time during the year that Lake Macatawa experiences anaerobic conditions (i. e. DO concentrations < 1 mg L- 1), internal loads were estimated for the extreme conditions of year-round anoxia, as well as anoxia for 20 % of the year, which was the percentage measured in Spring Lake, MI (Steinman et al. 2004) ...|$|R
