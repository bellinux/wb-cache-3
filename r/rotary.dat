5|$|Broaching is a {{machining}} process {{that uses a}} toothed tool, called a broach, to remove material. There are two main types of broaching: linear and <b>rotary.</b> In linear broaching, which is the more common process, the broach is run linearly against a surface of the workpiece to effect the cut. Linear broaches are used in a broaching machine, which is also sometimes shortened to broach. In <b>rotary</b> broaching, the broach is rotated and pressed into the workpiece to cut an axisymmetric shape. A <b>rotary</b> broach is used in a lathe or screw machine. In both processes the cut is performed in one pass of the broach, which makes it very efficient.|$|E

5|$|<b>Rotary</b> fan, {{manual and}} water-powered: For {{purposes}} of air conditioning, the Han Dynasty craftsman and mechanical engineer Ding Huan (fl. 180 AD) invented a manually operated <b>rotary</b> fan with seven wheels that measured 3m (10ft) in diameter; in the 8th century, during the Tang Dynasty (618–907), the Chinese applied hydraulic power to rotate the fan wheels for air conditioning, while the <b>rotary</b> fan {{became even more}} common during the Song Dynasty (960–1279). The first <b>rotary</b> fan used in Europe was for mine ventilation during the 16th century, as illustrated by German mineralogist and metallurgist Georg Agricola (1494–1555).|$|E
50|$|The {{favourable}} {{power-to-weight ratio}} of the <b>rotaries</b> was their greatest advantage. While larger, heavier aircraft relied almost exclusively on conventional in-line engines, many fighter aircraft designers preferred <b>rotaries</b> {{right up to the}} end of the war.|$|R

5|$|In 1904, the Met {{opened a}} 10.5MW {{coal-fired}} power station at Neasden, which supplied 11kV 33.3Hz current to five substations that converted this to 600VDC using <b>rotary</b> converters.|$|E
5|$|In general, a <b>rotary</b> broach {{will not}} cut as {{accurately}} as a push or pull broach. However, {{the ability to}} use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly advantageous.|$|E

50|$|The {{experience}} with traffic circles and <b>rotaries</b> in the USA was almost entirely negative, characterized by high accident rates and congestion problems. By the mid 1950s, construction of traffic circles and <b>rotaries</b> had ceased entirely. The {{experience with}} traffic circles {{in other countries}} was not much better until {{the development of the}} modern roundabout in the United Kingdom during the 1960s.|$|R

5|$|A {{somewhat}} different design of cutting tool that can achieve the irregular hole or outer {{profile of a}} broach is called a <b>rotary</b> broach or wobble broach. One of the biggest advantages {{to this type of}} broaching {{is that it does not}} require a broaching machine, but instead is used on lathes, milling machines, screw machines or Swiss lathes.|$|E

5|$|Angular motions (or <b>rotary</b> motions) {{occur when}} an object is around another object {{increasing}} or decreasing the angle. The {{different parts of}} the object do not move the same distance. Examples include a movement of the knee, where the lower leg changes angle compared to the femur, or movements of the ankle.|$|E
5|$|Archaea, a {{group of}} prokaryotes {{separate}} from bacteria, also feature flagella driven by <b>rotary</b> motor proteins, which are structurally and evolutionarily distinct from bacterial flagella. Whereas bacterial flagella evolved from the bacterial Type III secretion system, archaeal flagella appear to have evolved from Type IV pili.|$|E
5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a <b>rotary</b> engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, and some are driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The <b>rotary</b> motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
