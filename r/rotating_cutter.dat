25|$|A {{milling machine}} is a machine tool {{used for the}} shaping of metal and other solid materials. In {{contrast}} to drilling, where the drill is moved exclusively along its axis, the milling operation uses movement of the <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> sideways as well as 'in and out'. Simeon North is generally credited for inventing and building the earliest, though primitive, milling machine to replace filing operations by about 1816 or even earlier.|$|E
25|$|Construction {{commenced}} on March 8, 2005. Three major {{construction sites}} had been established, at Malmö C, Triangeln and Holma/Hyllie. By {{the end of}} 2006, another construction site had been opened in Lockarp, where connecting tracks to Ystad and Trelleborg were being built. The underground station at Malmö C was built in a 0.8km long open trench which was then covered. To minimize traffic disruption, the extensive and time-consuming work was done in stages. In order to build Triangeln station, two 25 m deep vertical shafts were dug at {{the northern and southern}} part of the site, and the station was then milled out of the rock by a roadheader — a machine equipped with a <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> head on a telescopic arm. The rock was then lined with concrete elements to finish the structure. Hyllie Station was built in an approximately 7 m deep shaft; the vault that covers the station is a distinct landmark in the Hyllie development area. The tunnel was mostly bored by two tunnel boring machines (TBMs). Underground drilling commenced in November 2006 and February 2007, respectively. On 25 March 2008, one of the TBMs achieved breakthrough at Malmö C, followed by the second TBM on April 21. Work was completed in December 2010, six months ahead of schedule.|$|E

40|$|The Touch and Go Surface Sampler (TGSS) is a {{new class}} of {{planetary}} and small body sample acquisition tool {{that can be used for}} the surface exploration of Europa, Titan and comets. TGSS in its basic configuration consists of a high speed sampling head attached to the end of a flexible shaft. The sampling head consists of counter <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters</b> that <b>rotates</b> at speeds of 3000 to 15000 RPM.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} use of Computer Numerical Control (CNC), there is a growing need for reliable on-line tool condition monitoring systems that are capable of sensing worn or broken tools. A tool condition monitoring system not only prevents losses owing to spoilt jobs but also minimizes premature tool replacement. In the long run, it helps to reduce manufacturing costs, increase machine tool utilization, optimize cutting conditions and build a reliable and intelligent manufacturing system. This thesis presents a new method of tool condition monitoring for machining processes that employ <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters,</b> such as milling and drilling. It focusses on end-milling cutters but it can be extended to other types of <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters</b> as well. The method used for tool wear measurement is based on laser diffraction. As a coherent laser light source passes through a slit, which is formed between a reference edge and the cutting edge of the cutter, a characteristic diffraction pattern is obtained. The luminous pattern of light consists of a number of fringes. The image can be captured by a CCD camera and various image processing techniques are employed to determine the fringe spacing. The fringe spacing is mathematically correlated to the width of the slit and accordingly, can be used to calculate the tool wear. A prototype measurement system was designed and fabricated. Experiments were conducted and good results were obtained. Comparing the mechanical and optical measurements methods, the maximum error was only 16...|$|R
50|$|Drilling {{operations}} are operations in which holes are produced or refined by bringing a <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> with cutting edges {{at the lower}} extremity {{into contact with the}} workpiece. Drilling {{operations are}} done primarily in drill presses but sometimes on lathes or mills.|$|E
50|$|In operation, {{the table}} is set to the desired height and then the machine is {{switched}} on. The board is fed into the machine until it makes contact with the in-feed roller which grips the board and draws it into the machine and past the <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> head. The knives remove material on the way through and the out-feed roller pulls the board through and ejects it from the machine {{at the end of}} the pass.|$|E
50|$|Cutting speed (also called {{surface speed}} or simply speed) {{may be defined}} as the rate (or speed) at the {{workpiece}} surface, irrespective of the machining operation used. A cutting speed for mild steel, of 100 ft/min (or approx 30 meters/min) is the same whether it is the speed of the (stationary) cutter passing over the (moving) workpiece, such as in a turning operation, or the speed of the (<b>rotating)</b> <b>cutter</b> moving past a (stationary) workpiece, such as in a milling operation. What will affect the value of this surface speed for mild steel, is the cutting conditions.|$|E
50|$|A {{special-purpose}} lathe, the Rose engine lathe, is {{also used}} for ornamental turning, in particular for engine turning, typically in precious metals, for example to decorate pocket-watch cases. As well as {{a wide range of}} accessories, these lathes usually have complex dividing arrangements to allow the exact rotation of the mandrel. Cutting is usually carried out by <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters,</b> rather than directly by the rotation of the work itself. Because of the difficulty of polishing such work, the materials turned, such as wood or ivory, are usually quite soft, and the cutter has to be exceptionally sharp. The finest ornamental lathes are generally considered to be those made by Holtzapffel {{around the turn of the}} 19th century.|$|R
50|$|Surface {{feet per}} minute (SFPM or SFM) is the {{combination}} of a physical quantity (surface speed) and an imperial and American customary unit (feet per minute). It is defined as the number of linear feet that a location on a rotating component travels in one minute. Its most common use is in the measurement of cutting speed (surface speed) in machining. It is a unit of velocity that describes how fast the cutting edge of the cutting tool travels. It correlates directly to the machinability of the workpiece material and the hardness of the cutting tool material. It relates to spindle speed via variables such as <b>cutter</b> diameter (for <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters)</b> or workpiece diameter (for lathe work).|$|R
50|$|A popular way {{to build}} gears is by form cutting. This is done by taking a blank gear and <b>rotating</b> a <b>cutter,</b> with the desired tooth pattern, around its periphery. This ensures that the gear will fit when the {{operation}} is finished.|$|R
5000|$|In fabricating, {{a profile}} {{consists}} of the more-or-less complex outline of a shape to be cut in a sheet of material such as laminated plastic, aluminium alloy or steel plate. In modern practice, a drawing office determines {{the shape and dimensions}} required to fit the sheet into a larger work and feeds directions to a computer controlling a profile cutter. This then cuts the shape from a standard-sized sheet. The cutting head may use a <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> like that of a spindle router or (in the case of steel plate) a torch which burns oxy-acetylene or other oxy-gas.|$|E
50|$|This tool, {{first on}} sale in 2007, cuts mortises {{in the manner of}} a biscuit joiner. A drill-like <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> cuts a round-ended mortise. Each plunge creates a mortise that is sized to accept a Domino loose tenon, {{creating}} joints in stock from 22.2 mm wide. There are five cutter sizes (4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm) for six different Domino tenon sizes. Self-referencing pins allow the cutting of rows of evenly spaced mortises with no need to measure and mark. Mortise width is adjustable in three increments with the turn of a knob, and cuts can be overlapped for long mortises. Fence tilts from 0-90°, with stop positions at 0°, 22.5°, 45°, 67.5°, 90°.|$|E

5000|$|Regular fly cutters (one tool bit, swept {{diameter}} usually {{less than}} 100 mm) are widely sold in machinists' tooling catalogs. Fly bars are rarely sold commercially; {{they are usually}} made by the user. Fly bars are perhaps a bit more dangerous to use than endmills and regular fly cutters because of their larger swing. As one machinist put it, running a fly bar is like [...] "running a lawn mower without the deck", that is, the exposed swinging cutter is a rather large opportunity to take in nearby hand tools, rags, fingers, and so on. However, given that a machinist can never be careless with impunity around <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters</b> or workpieces, this just means using the same care as always except with slightly higher stakes. Well-made fly bars in conscientious hands give years of trouble-free, cost-effective service for the facing off of large polygonal workpieces such as die/mold blocks.|$|R

40|$|Common {{practice}} in industry is to <b>rotate</b> the milling <b>cutter</b> {{in only one}} direction even though the geometry of the inserts are thus {{that they could be}} used again while the milling <b>cutter</b> is <b>rotating</b> in the opposite direction.

Afterwards the inserts where used in another milling head which rotated in the opposite direction. The experiments were conducted while milling duplex stainless steel SAF 2304. This due to that machining of duplex stainless steel is often thought of as leading to adhesive wear of the cutting tool which added an important type of tool wear to the investigation in addition to the dominating abrasive wear. The experimental results show that by <b>rotating</b> the milling <b>cutter</b> in both directions it was possible to increase the tool utilization with approximately 80 %...|$|R
50|$|A chopper pump is {{operated}} by a drive unit (e.g. electric motor, hydraulic motor, PTO), which turns the impeller and the cutting system. An open impeller design is used to successfully pass the macerated solids or thick slurry. A set of hardened steel cutters is installed externally to the pump suction in order to macerate all solids prior to entering the hydraulic parts of the pump. A chopper pump {{should not be confused}} with a grinder pump, which uses its impeller as part of the cutting mechanism. Grinder pumps are typically used for light weight sewage applications, whereas chopper pumps are used for tough solids handling applications. The chopping system consists of a set of <b>rotating</b> <b>cutters</b> that are keyed to the shaft and work in conjunction with the stationary cutters, which are bolted to the suction plate. A system of mechanical seals are used to prevent the pumped liquid from entering the motor. The pump can either be connected to a pipe, flexible hose or lowered down a guide rail so that the pump sits on a coupling foot (aka base elbow), thereby connecting it to the discharge pipe.|$|R

40|$|In the thesis, a {{prototype}} object-oriented fuzzy expert system called SAM (Smart Assistant to Machinist) is presented for <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> selection and cutting condition design. Object-Oriented Design and Programming Methods are employed {{to construct and}} implement the system. Based on partial and imprecise information, the system is able to select <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> products available in current commercial market, and design cutting conditions for an optimized objective. The system consists of four modules: a database, a rule base, a cutter selection module and a cutting condition design module. The database consists of six kinds of data files: machinability of workpieces, machining plan, fuzzy rule, tool adapter, machine tool, as well as cutter inventory files. The rules in the rule base are developed based on fuzzy set theory. They are used to cross-define unknown information and to determine {{the relationships between the}} inputs and outputs information. The cutter selection module is developed based on fuzzy logic, in which the cutter selection is conducted in three steps. First, the input information is 2 ̆ 2 fuzzied 2 ̆ 2. Next, using the fuzzy correlation functions, insert grades and cutters are selected. Then, the selected grades and cutters are searched against the cutter inventory data file to check the availability. The cutting condition design module is developed based on fuzzy non-linear programming where the design constraints could be fuzzy. The model is solved by Hill Climbing Algorithm.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a new approach to}} the problem of collision detection between a rotating milling-cutter of an NC-machine and a model of a solid workpiece, as the <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> continuously moves near the workpiece. Having five degrees of motion freedom, this problem is hard to solve exactly and we approximate the motion of the tool by a sequence of subpaths of pure translations interleaved with pure rotations. The detection problem along each sub-path is then solved by using radial projection of the obstacles (the workpiece {{and other parts of the}} NC-machine) around the tool axis to obtain a collection of critical surface patches in IR 3, and by examining planar silhouettes of these surface patches. We thus reduce the problem to successive computations of the lower envelope of a set of planar curves — this reduction is exact, and incurs no loss of accuracy. We have implemente...|$|E
40|$|Abstract––Milling is a {{metal removal}} process {{by means of}} using a <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> having one or more cutting teeth. A milling machine is a machine tool used to machine solid materials. Milling {{machines}} are often classed in two basic forms horizontal and vertical. This refers to {{the orientation of the}} main spindle. At all types of milling machines, the cutting tool performs a rotational motion that is the cutting motion. The rotation axis of the tool could be horizontal or vertical, depending on machine tool version. The feeding motion is achieved either by part or tool, or both; usually on three perpendicular directions. Milling machine is automated using Electro pneumatic system. Milling process is the second most common method (after turning) for metal cutting and especially for the finishing of Machined parts. In modern industry the goal is to manufacture low cost, high quality products in short time. Keywords––Milling, Electro pneumatic, cutting tool, cutter, automated. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a two-dimensional steady-state incompressible {{analysis for the}} minimum quantity of lubricant flow in milling operations using a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The analysis of flow and heat transfer in a four-teeth milling cutter operation was undertaken. The domain of the <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> along with the spray nozzle is defined. Operating cutting and boundary conditions are taken from the literature. A steady-state, pressure-based, planar analysis was performed with a viscous, realizable k-ε model. A mixture of oils and air were sprayed on the tool, which {{is considered to be}} rotating and is at a temperature near the melting temperature of the workpiece. Flow fields are obtained from the study. The vector plot of the flow field shows that the flow is not evenly distributed over the cutter surface, as well as the uneven distribution of the lubricant {{in the direction of the}} cutter rotation. It can be seen that the cutting fluid has not completely penetrated the tool edges. The turbulence created by the cutter rotation in the proximity of the tool throws oil drops out of the cutting zone. The nozzle position in relation to the feed direction is very important in order to obtain the optimum effect of the MQL flow. ...|$|E
40|$|A 3 -dimensional {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} analysis of minimum quantity lubricant flow for a four-tooth milling cutter operation with single and three nozzles is presented in this paper. CFD modelling is utilized to simulate the flow distribution around a four- tooth milling. The domain of a <b>rotating</b> <b>cutter</b> along with the spraying nozzle was defined. Operating cutting and boundary conditions were defined based on previous literature. A steady-state, pressure-based, planar analysis was performed with a viscous, realizable k-ε model. A 3 -D transient-case, incompressible analysis for the minimum quantity lubricant is also performed. The domain of the milling cutter is rotated {{at a very high}} spindle speed, and a single nozzle is used to investigate the effects of MQL spray. A mixture of oils and air is sprayed onto the tool. Another analysis is performed with three nozzles placed at equal angles to each other around the periphery of the tool. A 2 -dimensional steady-state analysis is also carried out using CFD. The obtained results verify that the single nozzle cannot fully lubricate the rotating tool. It was observed that flow penetration into the cutting zone is dependent on the flow velocity and the number of nozzles. Hence, it can be concluded that the MQL nozzle arrangement can be improved with three nozzles with a constant mass flow rate...|$|E

Bioptic samples of bone tissue were taken during operations with rotating burs and piezoelectric terminals to increase bone volume before implantology. Samples first underwent histomorphometric analysis. Subsequently, osteoblastic cells, obtained from different samples, were placed in culture and allowed to proliferate to in vitro evaluate the time to initiate growth and to reach confluence. Finally, a molecular biologic study by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate the expression of typical osteoblastic molecular markers, such as osteoprotegerin and osteopontin. Histomorphometric analysis showed that the width of necrotic line on the osteotomic margins from samples taken using different techniques did not vary significantly. Moreover, the times of initial growth and of confluence in cells from the 2 groups did not show any statistically significant differences. However, a highly significant correlation was revealed between the age of the patient and the initial growth time and the confluence. Similarly, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that the osteoprotegerin and osteopontin expression levels did not change significantly according to the surgical technique used. In conclusion, osteotomies carried out with either instrument do not seem to substantially influence the vitality of the bone tissue. The variability of the expression levels of typical osteoblastic markers seems to be linked more to other factors than to the surgical technique used...|$|R
