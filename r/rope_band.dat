50|$|After {{being pushed}} south and westward by the Lakota, the unified Cheyenne {{people began to}} create and expand a new {{territory}} of their own. Sometime around 1811 the Cheyenne made a formal alliance with the Arapaho people (Hetanevo'eo'o - „People of the Sky“, „Cloud People“, because of their close interaction also known as Héstanėheo'o - “people, mankind, tribe of people”), which would remain strong throughout their history and into modern times. The alliance helped the Cheyenne expand their territory which stretched from southern Montana, through most of Wyoming, {{the eastern half of}} Colorado, far western Nebraska, and far western Kansas. As early as 1820, traders and explorers reported contact with Cheyenne at present-day Denver, Colorado and on the Arkansas River. They were probably hunting and trading in that area earlier. They may have migrated to the south for winter. The Hairy <b>Rope</b> <b>band</b> is reputed to have been the first band to move south, capturing wild horses as far south as the Cimarron River Valley. In response to the construction of Bent’s Fort by Charles Bent, a friend of the Cheyenne who established a popular trading area for the Cheyenne, {{a large portion of the}} tribe moved further south and stayed around the area. The other part of the tribe continued to live along the headwaters of the North Platte and Yellowstone rivers. The groups became the Southern Cheyenne, known as Sówoníă (Southerners) and the Northern Cheyenne, known as O'mǐ'sǐs (Eaters). The separation of the tribe was only a geographic one and the two divisions had regular and close contact.|$|E
50|$|Types {{coming out}} of the Late Eastern Zhou are spherical in form and possess three animal masks in relief; the heads are {{situated}} symmetrically around the lid, mirroring the three Ding-like feet supporting the base. Simple linear patterning covers the vessel in clearly defined registers, while high-relief <b>rope</b> <b>bands</b> separate the basin from the lid.|$|R
50|$|Four years ago, {{border patrol}} agent Jim Rhodes (Steve Austin) was {{stationed}} in Texas. Jim and his partner, his longtime friend Lee Davis (Eric Roberts), are staking out what looks like an empty trailer. As a gift, Lee gives Jim a watch that has a band made from climbing <b>rope.</b> The <b>band</b> can be unraveled and used in case of emergency.|$|R
50|$|Give Them <b>Rope</b> is Missouri <b>band</b> Coalesce's 1997 debut {{full-length}} album. It was re-released in 2004 in a remastered and remixed format. It {{was later}} rereleased by Relapse. This album has never charted.|$|R
50|$|The music {{programme}} {{was aimed}} at all tastes: a concert version of Gershwin’s opera Porgy and Bess and two performances of Jonathan Doves’s opera Tobias and the Angel; a symphony concert; jazz with the Big Chris Barber Band, the Royal Northern College of Music Jazz Collective and Dave Mott; and folk with the New <b>Rope</b> String <b>Band.</b> The Upbeat Beatles sang with the Festival Orchestra and 17-year-old singer-songwriter Joni Fuller had a solo.|$|R
5000|$|Nidana is a Sanskrit {{word that}} means [...] "cause, {{motivation}} or occasion" [...] {{depending on the}} context. The word is derived from ni (down, into) and da (to bind, dana). It appears in the Rigveda, such as hymn 10.114.2, and other Hindu scriptures, wherein it means [...] "primary or first cause, linked cause"; in other contexts such as Rigveda 6.32.6, nidana refers to a <b>rope</b> or <b>band</b> that links, binds or fastens one thing to another, such as a horse to a cart.|$|R
5000|$|In Easter of 2005, Folkestra {{took part}} in a UK tour called [...] "The Road to the North" [...] to {{celebrate}} the rich traditional music of the North East of England. They performed here alongside The Kathryn Tickell Band, Alistair Anderson, Louis Killen, and the Old <b>Rope</b> String <b>Band.</b> With two successful CDs and a growing national reputation, Folkestra have performed at many concerts and festivals across the country, and also at the BBC Proms first ever Folk Day at the Royal Albert Hall. In the summer of 2012, Folkestra are to perform at Traflgar Square in the River of Music festival.|$|R
50|$|A typical torque {{amplifier}} {{consists of two}} capstans positioned end-to-end along a common line of rotation, typically horizontal. A single source of torque is supplied, typically from an electric motor, which is geared to power the two drums to spin in opposite directions. A single <b>rope</b> (or <b>band)</b> is wrapped around the two drums. If tension is applied to {{one end of the}} rope, its capstan pulls on it, which in turn tensions the output. Like the single capstan, the motion starts and stops as soon as the tension is applied or released, but generally the motion is smooth with varying degrees of torque being applied to the input.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} 7 years, he experimented on himself by {{applying}} different bicycle tubes, <b>ropes</b> and <b>bands</b> at different pressures on {{various parts of}} his body. He methodically kept track of what type of bands and pressures worked and what experiments did not. With years of detailed trial and error, Sato gradually developed effective protocols to safely modify blood flow in his limbs. By 1973 {{at the age of}} 25, Sato developed the details of Kaatsu as it is currently practiced. At that time, on a ski trip, he fractured his ankle and damaged the ligaments around his knee. The injuries were diagnosed and the doctors told Sato that it would take 6 months to heal.|$|R
500|$|Around {{the turn}} of the year, the band members {{attended}} a special private screening of a new film, Rude Boy; part fiction, part rockumentary, it {{tells the story of a}} Clash fan who leaves his job in a Soho sex shop to become a roadie for the group. The movie—named after the rude boy subculture—includes footage of the band on tour, at a London Rock Against Racism concert, and in the studio recording Give 'Em Enough <b>Rope.</b> The <b>band</b> was so disenchanted with it that they had Better Badges make buttons that declared [...] "I don't want RUDE BOY Clash Film". On 27 February 1980, it premiered at the 30th Berlin International Film Festival, where it won an honourable mention.|$|R
5000|$|... "Alcohol" [...] {{has been}} covered {{numerous}} times. Tankard, a German thrash metal band, featured the song on their album Chemical Invasion, Impaled Nazarene, a black metal band from Finland, who included {{it on their}} EP entitled Motörpenis which was released in 1996, Boston punkrock band Dropkick Murphys covered the song on their [...] "Back to the Hub" [...] 7 inch, and also included it on their live album Live on St. Patrick's Day from Boston, MA, The Meatmen covered it on their album Pope on a <b>Rope,</b> Swedish <b>band</b> No Fun at All covered the song on their album No Straight Angles (US edition), and Metallica {{have been known to}} play the song live. The song also appears on the soundtrack to the 2010 film Jackass 3D.|$|R
5|$|After {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album Give 'Em Enough <b>Rope</b> (1978), the <b>band</b> {{separated from their}} manager Bernard Rhodes. This separation meant that the group had to leave their rehearsal studio in Camden Town and find another location to compose their music. Tour manager Johnny Green and drum roadie Baker had found the group a new place to rehearse called Vanilla Studios, which was located {{in the back of}} a garage in Pimlico.|$|R
5000|$|Banded Together: Teams will {{be joined}} {{together}} by a rubber <b>band</b> <b>rope</b> at one pole, and the teams must work together and work {{their way to the}} pole {{on the opposite side of}} the field, and hold onto the pole for five seconds. The farther the teams get from one pole, the harder it will be to reach the pole. The team that reaches the other pole first and holds on for five seconds wins.|$|R
50|$|Point hoists using {{wire rope}} (GAC) are common, and steel band point hoists are also used. While {{generally}} {{more expensive than}} chain hoists, wire <b>rope</b> and steel <b>band</b> point hoists can operate at relatively high speeds. Wire rope spot line winches may be configured to pay {{out to the side}} (horizontally), for use in conjunction with a loft block, so that the position of the relatively heavy winch can be static and only the loft block need be spotted above the pick point.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] said young Partington, [...] "for {{the matter}} of that, it is ill enow. The King hath been bitterly stirred up against thee by that vile Bishop of Hereford. He sent to arrest thee at the archery butts at Finsbury Fields, but not finding thee there, he hath {{gathered}} together his armed men, fifty-score and more, and is sending them in haste along this very road to Sherwood, either to take thee on the way or to prevent thy {{getting back to the}} woodlands again. He hath given the Bishop of Hereford command over all these men, and thou knowest what thou hast to expect of the Bishop of Hereford--short shrift and a long <b>rope.</b> Two <b>bands</b> of horsemen are already upon the road, not far behind me, so thou hadst best get thee gone from this place straightway, for, if thou tarriest longer, thou art like to sleep this night in a cold dungeon. This word the Queen hath bidden me bring to thee." ...|$|R
60|$|The yard of the Vaughan resembled that {{of other}} large collieries. It was a large space, black and grimy, on which lines of rails were laid down in all directions; on these stood trains of waggons, while here and there were great piles of coal. In the centre rose up a lofty {{scaffolding}} of massive beams. At {{the top of this}} was the wheel over which a strong wire <b>rope</b> or <b>band</b> ran to the winding engine close by, while from the other end hung the cage, a wooden box some six feet square. At the corner of this box were clips or runners which fitted on to the guides in the shaft and so prevented any motion of swinging or swaying. So smoothly do these cages work that, standing in one as it is lowered or drawn up, only a very slight vibration or tremor tells that you are in motion. Near the square house in which stood the winding engine was another precisely similar occupied by the pumping engine.|$|R
40|$|Roping {{is a major}} {{disadvantage}} {{for the use of}} AA 6 xxx {{aluminum alloys}} for the production of car body parts. Roping is a strain induced surface roughness, manifesting itself as a series of ridges along the rolling direction, and seems {{to be related to the}} macroscopic banding of specific texture components at the surface of the sheet. The present study will quantify this banding tendency. A numerical parameter, the banding severity, will be deduced from the frequency spectrum of an EBSD surface texture plot to quantify the banding tendency of the main texture components. Two AA 6 xxx aluminum sheets with contrasting industrial qualities will be investigated. It will be shown that the banding severity along the rolling direction is very high for the Cube and Goss texture components in the sheet highly susceptible to <b>roping.</b> The <b>banding</b> severities for the other texture components are not very pronounced. This observation suggests a plausible link between the macroscopic banding of the Cube and Goss texture components and the roping phenomenon. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

50|$|The drum {{corps of}} a pipe band {{consists}} of a section of drummers playing highland snare drums and the bass section (see below). In {{the early days of}} pipe <b>bands,</b> <b>rope</b> tension snare drums were common, but as the technology evolved, so did the music. Pipe band drummers now play on drums with very tight, knitted kevlar heads, designed for maximum tension to create a very crisp and strident sound. Due to technological innovations and changing aesthetics, this crispness has {{become an integral part of}} the pipe band sound. Since today's drum is so facile as a result of its design, players are often able to execute extremely complicated and technically demanding rudimentary patterns.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{principal}} reasons for a decline into Fourth section status lies in the difficulties of recruiting new players. In the past when Britain had extensive heavy industries, these would sponsor brass bands, who would then bear their name. For example, the once-great Melin Griffith Band of Cardiff was adopted by Excelsior Rope Works when the Melingriffith Tin Plate Works closed down, and then they became the Excelsior <b>Rope</b> Works <b>Band.</b> The decline in industrial sponsorship removed the financial backing which supported such vital items as a practice room, uniforms, instruments, stands, chairs, and music, which taken together cost {{far more than a}} subscription band can ever afford. However, with very few exceptions, these bands have been struggling to get by supported only by the members' subscriptions, the occasional sponsored concerts, and playing Christmas carols. Not infrequently, practice rooms become unavailable, adding still more to the pressure to disband, and many bands have disappeared or amalgamated in recent years. A further problem is that players of ability would normally rather play in a band which stretches them, so it becomes hard to recruit good players for a lower section band, and this increases the problem.|$|R
5000|$|Budet met {{and became}} {{good friends with}} {{producer}} GrandMarnier in 2000, and in 2005, they began making music together when both wanted to start an electropop band. The name of the band, Yelle, began as an acronym of the phrase [...] "You Enjoy Life", [...] "YEL", but was later feminised to [...] "Yelle" [...] because a Belgian band had the name already. Yelle rose to fame on MySpace when they posted a song titled [...] "Short Dick Cuizi", which later became [...] "Je veux te voir", in late 2005. The song's original title refers to Cuizinier of French alternative hip-hop band TTC and was released as a mock diss track. It received a positive response and soon {{attracted the attention of}} record label Source Etc. The song later charted at No. 4 in France. Yelle then began working on and recording their debut album, Pop Up, in 2006. While performing at night, producer Tepr had been <b>roped</b> into the <b>band</b> in 2007 after meeting GrandMarnier while working as a journalist. They were in need of a keyboard player on tour.|$|R
40|$|After-school classes {{represent}} {{an integral part}} of the educational process organized by schools within the extended programme, aimed to students from grade 1 to 6 of Primary school. The goals are intrinsic and upgrade the general educational goals of the class levels while the content reflects interests and needs of the students as well as their parents. Different special interests activities take place during the classes and those are conducted by the after-school class teacher according to their special skills and training. Through the research I wanted to show how and to what extend the teachers include sports activities in the after- school classes and/or if there are any statistically significant differences between the teachers in Ljubljana and schools in other parts. The model is based on 52 after-school class teachers from Slovenia. The findings have shown that sports and PE take up the biggest portion of the after-school time, most of the teachers include it every day, the ball games and spontaneous games and motor activities take the lead. The form and the scope are influenced by season and weather. Most teachers use the available resources – balls, skip <b>ropes</b> and elastic <b>bands</b> (‘gummy twist’) ...|$|R
