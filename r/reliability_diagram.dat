If the life distributions of the components are known, the reliability of the system can be calculated. These calculations can become complex as the number of components increase.

40|$|The {{transformation}} of a real, continuous variable into an event probability is reviewed from the Bayesian point of view, after which a Gaussian model is employed to derive an explicit expression for the probability. In turn, several scalar (one-dimensional) measures of performance quality, and <b>reliability</b> <b>diagrams</b> are computed. It is shown {{that if the}} optimization of scalar measures is of concern, then prior probabilities must be treated carefully, whereas no special care is required for <b>reliability</b> <b>diagrams.</b> Specifically, since a scalar measure gauges only one component of performance quality - a multidimensional entity - {{it is possible to}} find the critical value of prior probability that optimizes that scalar measure; this value of "prior probability" is often not equal to the "true" value as estimated from group sample sizes. Optimum reliability, however, is obtained when prior probability is equal to the estimate based on group sample sizes. Exact results are presented for the crit [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Reliability {{is seen as}} {{a primary}} {{requirement}} when verifying probabilistic forecasts since a lack of reliability would introduce systematic bias in subsequent decision-making. <b>Reliability</b> <b>diagrams</b> comprise popular and practical diagnostic tools for the reliability evaluation of density forecasts of continuous variables. Such diagrams relate to the assessment of the unconditional calibration of probabilistic forecasts. A reason for their appeal is that deviations from perfect reliability can be visually assessed based on deviations from the diagonal. Deviations from the diagonal may however be caused by both sampling effects and serial correlation in the forecast-verification pairs. We build on a recent proposal consisting of associating <b>reliability</b> <b>diagrams</b> with consistency bars that would reflect the deviations from the diagonal potentially observable even if density forecasts were perfectly reliable. Our consistency bars however reflect potential deviations originating from the combined effects of limited counting statistics and of serial correlation in the forecast-verification pairs. They are generated based on an original surrogate consistency resampling method. Its ability to provide consistency bars with a significantly better coverage against the i. i. d. resampling alternative is shown from simulations. A practical example of the reliability assessment of nonparametric density forecasts of short-term wind power generation is finally given.
