25|$|Apposition eyes work by {{gathering}} {{a number}} of images, one from each eye, and combining them in the brain, with each eye typically contributing a single point of information. The typical apposition eye has a lens focusing light from one direction on the <b>rhabdom,</b> while light from other directions is absorbed by the dark wall of the ommatidium.|$|E
25|$|The {{second type}} is named the {{superposition}} eye. The superposition eye {{is divided into}} three types; the refracting, the reflecting and the parabolic superposition eye. The refracting superposition eye has a gap between the lens and the <b>rhabdom,</b> and no side wall. Each lens takes light at an angle to its axis and reflects it to the same angle on the other side. The result is an image at half the radius of the eye, which is where the tips of the rhabdoms are. This type of compound eye, for which a minimal size exists below which effective superposition cannot occur, is normally found in nocturnal insects, because it can create images up to 1000 times brighter than equivalent apposition eyes, though at the cost of reduced resolution. In the parabolic superposition compound eye type, seen in arthropods such as mayflies, the parabolic surfaces of the inside of each facet focus light from a reflector to a sensor array. Long-bodied decapod crustaceans such as shrimp, prawns, crayfish and lobsters are alone in having reflecting superposition eyes, which also have a transparent gap but use corner mirrors instead of lenses.|$|E
25|$|Rows 1–4 of the midband are {{specialised}} for colour vision, from ultraviolet to longer wavelengths. Their UV vision {{can detect}} five different frequency bands {{in the deep}} ultraviolet. To do this they use two photoreceptors in combination with four different colour filters. They are not currently believed {{to be sensitive to}} infrared light. The optical elements in these rows have eight different classes of visual pigments and the <b>rhabdom</b> (area of eye that absorbs light from a single direction) is divided into three different pigmented layers (tiers), each for different wavelengths. The three tiers in rows 2 and 3 are separated by colour filters (intrarhabdomal filters) that can be divided into four distinct classes, two classes in each row. It is organised like a sandwich; a tier, a colour filter of one class, a tier again, a colour filter of another class, and then a last tier. These colour filters allow the mantis shrimp to see with diverse colour vision. Without the filters, the pigments themselves range only a small segment of the visual spectrum: about 490-550nm. Rows 5–6 are also segregated into different tiers, but have only one class of visual pigment (a ninth class) and are specialised for polarisation vision. They can detect different planes of polarised light. A tenth class of visual pigment is found in the upper and lower hemispheres of the eye.|$|E

Although fully dark-adapted <b>rhabdoms</b> are nonfluorescent or very weakly fluorescent, an increasing emission appears on exposure to light. Over the 30 -fold range of intensities studied, {{the rate of}} the appearance of this fluorescence is identical to the rate of formation of metarhodopsin from rhodopsin. Furthermore, the excitation spectra for the observed emission are similar to the absorption spectra of crayfish metarhodopsin at both neutral and acid pH. Finally, the amount of fluorescence observed in <b>rhabdoms</b> previously irradiated with selected wavelengths of light is proportional to the amount of metarhodopsin present in the photosteady state established by the prior irradiation. The emission therefore originates from crayfish metarhodopsin. Fluorescence emission peaks at 670 nm at neutral pH. The quantum efficiency is 1. 6 +/- 0. 4 X 10 (- 3). Although emission from other rhodopsin photoproducts has previously been noted, this is the first description of fluorescence from the metarhodopsin chromophore site...|$|R

5000|$|The {{retinula}} (literally, [...] "small retina") {{cells of}} the ommatidium of the compound eye contain areas from which membranous organelles of conceivable size (rhabdomeres) extend.

This forms the <b>rhabdom,</b> which contains the dendrite of the eccentric cell, and may also contribute some microvilli. The only other species with an eccentric cell is the silkworm moth. Microvilli are composed of a double layer, 7 nm each and with 3.5 nm space of two electron-deficient boundaries in between. Where the microvilli meet, these outer borders fuse and yield five membranes about 15 nm thick.

40|$|Aspects of the {{morphology}} {{and optical}} physiology of reflecting superposition eyes {{have been investigated}} using species from various decapod crustacean taxa. The eyes {{all have the same}} basic structure of a distal dioptric layer and a proximal retinula layer, separated by an unpigmented clear zone. In the eyes of shrimps, lobsters and crayfish the clear zone is crossed by crystalline cone cell extensions. In squat lobsters this region is crossed by rhabdomeric lightguides. Porcelain crabs possess an eye intermediate in design. The superposition ray path, the action of corneal lenses and the presence of lightguides have been demonstrated and the refractive indices of several optical elements determined. These results have been used to produce ray tracing diagrams showing the optical pathways within these eyes. All of the eyes function by redirecting light across the clear zone by reflection within a mirrored crystalline cone. In squat lobsters a rhabdomeric lightguide transmits axial light to the <b>rhabdoms.</b> The eyes have a small f-number resulting in good light-gathering power and maximum sensitivity. However, intracellular electrophysiological determinations of retinula cell angular sensitivity show that these eyes have poor resolution. Variations in morphology and optics represent adaptations to the underwater light field, especially in the tapeta and in the light- sensitive <b>rhabdoms.</b> In oceanic species the tapetum varies in both structure and reflectivity along a dorso-ventral gradient within each eye and also interspecifically. It is proposed that the need to remain well-camouflaged in the low-contrast oceanic environment leads to tapetal modifications. Where sufficient light is available the <b>rhabdoms</b> are adapted to maximize resolution and permit sensitivity to polarized light. In deeper water, where little light remains, the <b>rhabdoms</b> are adapted to increase sensitivity at the expense of resolution. The dorsal region of the eye retains apposition optics for the purpose of detecting small objects in silhouette against the downwelling light...|$|R

40|$|Anopheles gambiae and Toxorhynchites brevipalpis {{represent}} the nocturnal and diurnal extremes of the mosquito light intensity range, {{and their eyes}} are structurally very different. A. gambiae has fused <b>rhabdoms</b> with huge acceptance angles, whereas T. brevipalpis has open <b>rhabdoms</b> with rhabdomere acceptance angles comparable with those of advanced (brachyceran) flies. Here, we show that the retina-lamina projections are consistent with these differences. The short receptor axons from each ommatidium in A. gambiae insert as a group between four lamina monopolar cell clusters. In T. brevipalpis axon bundles from each ommatidium undergo a twist in their passage through the nuclear layer of the lamina, and then fan out into a space the diameter of which is about twice {{the separation of the}} monopolar cell clusters. This arrangement is consistent with a neural superposition mechanism closely similar to that found in higher Diptera, but which must have evolved independently...|$|R
40|$|The eyes of {{crayfish}} {{were exposed}} to lights of known spectral composition, and the course of regeneration was followed in the dark by measuring the content of rhodopsin and metarhodopsin in single <b>rhabdoms</b> isolated at various times after the adaptation, using an assay {{that is based on}} the fluorescence of metarhodopsin. Complete recovery requires several days in the dark after intense adaptation to orange light, but requires < 2 d after blue light exposure. Following an orange light exposure with blue produces recovery kinetics characteristic of the blue light exposure alone. This quickening of recovery occurs whether the receptors are exposed to blue light either imme-diately or many hours after the original exposure to orange. Conversely, following blue light adaptation with orange leads to slow recovery, which is characteristic of orange alone. Recovery from long-wavelength adaptation is slower principally because many <b>rhabdoms</b> seem to delay the onset of regener-ation. We suggest that the regeneration system is itself photosensitive, and after orange light adaptation the supply of active chromophore (presumably 11 -cis retinal) limits the rate of recovery. Once started, recovery proceeds slowly and continuously, and the total pigment concentration (rhodopsin plus meta-rhodopsin) in the rhabdomeric membrane remains approximately constant. Within hours after intense adapting exposures, the <b>rhabdoms</b> become altered in appearance, the surfaces become coated with accessory pigment, and the bands of microvilli are less distinct. These changes persist until recovery of rhodopsin proceeds, which suggests that visual pigment regeneration results from addition of newly synthesized rhodopsin associated with membrane turn-over...|$|R
40|$|Functional {{aspects of}} the large {{diversity}} of eye design in prosobranch molluscs was investigated using morphological and optical methods. Three species from different habitats were investigated. Littorina littorea from Scandinavian intertidal rock habitats, Strombus raninus and S. gigas from tropical sand-flats and Ampularia sp. from heavily vegetated habitats in tropical fresh-water. Littorina and Strombus possess eyes which {{are among the most}} highly developed in gastropods: the eye of Strombus being one of the the largest and most complex. The eyes have well developed, near-spherical lenses of short focal length, and minimal spherical aberration. The large vitreous bodies allow for a focused image on the retina. The retinal array contains numerous photoreceptor cells with microvillar <b>rhabdoms</b> which are not optically isolated from each other (unshielded). The eye of Ampularia deviates from that of Strombus by having practically no vitreous body and an ovoid lens which displays severe aberrations. As in Littorina and Strombus the <b>rhabdoms</b> are not optically isolated from each other, but have a somewhat larger diameter. The consequence of unshielded <b>rhabdoms</b> is a lateral spread of light in the retina, which blurs the image and degrades spatial vision. The effect of lateral light-spread is significant in Strombus because of the unusually long and slender <b>rhabdoms,</b> but probably insignificant in the other two species. In Strombus there is thus an apparent mismatch between useful resolution and packing density of the retinal receptors. There is a similar but worse mismatch in Ampularia, because of lens aberrations. In Littorina, the match between optics and retina seems to be reasonable. To investigate possible reasons for the different degrees of correlation between optics and retina, a morphological study of the three species was made to compare the number of retinal receptors to the number of axons in the optic nerve. Fewer axons than receptors would imply convergence (summation) of signals, which would increase the sensitivity of the eye at the cost of resolution, by pooling neighbouring receptors into larger functional units. Strong convergence was found in Ampularia, less in Strombus, and none in Littorina, which one woud expect from the optics...|$|R
50|$|In true flies, the <b>rhabdom</b> has {{separated}} into seven independent rhabdomeres (there are actually eight, {{but the two}} central rhabdomeres responsible for color vision sit one atop the other), such that a small inverted 7-pixel image is formed in each ommatidium. Simultaneously, the rhabdomeres in adjacent ommatidia are aligned such that {{the field of view}} within an ommatidium is the same as that between ommatidia. The advantage of this arrangement is that the same visual axis is sampled from a larger area of the eye, thereby increasing sensitivity by a factor of seven, without increasing the size of the eye or reducing its acuity. Achieving this has also required the rewiring of the eye such that the axon bundles are twisted through 180 degrees (re-inverted), and each rhabdomere is united with those from the six adjacent ommatidia that share the same visual axis. Thus, {{at the level of the}} lamina - the first optical processing center of the insect brain - the signals are input in exactly the same manner as in the case of a normal apposition compound eye, but the image is enhanced. This visual arrangement is known as neural superposition.|$|E

To see how vision might influence male behavior, we studied the morphology, optics, and receptor physiology {{of their eyes}} and found the following. (1) Each eye's visual field is approximately hemispherical with at most a 10 degrees overlap {{in the fields of}} the eyes. There are no large sexual differences in visual field dimensions. (2) In both sexes, <b>rhabdoms</b> in the frontal and dorsal ommatidia are longer than those in other eye regions. (3) Interommatidial angles are smallest frontally and around the equator of the eye. Minimum interommatidial angles are 0. 9 - 1 degrees in males and 1. 3 - 1. 4 degrees in females. (4) Acceptance angles of ommatidia closely match interommatidial angles in the frontal region of the eye. We conclude that vision in these butterflies is mostly monocular and that males have more acute vision than females, especially in the frontal region (large facets, small interommatidial angles, small acceptance angles, long <b>rhabdoms,</b> and a close match between interommatidial angles and acceptance angles).

Male ants have more but smaller ommatidia and the smallest interommatidial angles, which is most likely an adaptation to visually track individual flying females.

Banded arrangement is observed in the <b>rhabdom.</b> The microvilli are parallel to each other in a rhabdomere. Seven retinular cells reach upto the cone level to form the fused <b>rhabdom.</b> The eighth retinular cell joins to the <b>rhabdom</b> at the proximal region of the ommatidia. Only one retinula cell nucleus appears at the most proximal regions of the ommatidia while the rest appear at the distal one third of the ommatidia.

40|$|The {{extent of}} screening-pigment (SP) {{migration}} in the intact octopus retina and the amplitude {{of the early}} receptor potential (ERP) correspond with the degree of adaptation to light or darkness. The light-adapted retina has SP granules concentrated in an apical layer, at {{the tips of the}} photoreceptor <b>rhabdoms</b> and supporting cells, and the ERP is barely detectable. In the fully dark-adapted retina, the SP granules are mostly {{at the base of the}} <b>rhabdoms,</b> and the ERP is at its maximum. Retinae at intermediate stages, between the fully dark- and light-adapted states, show corresponding intermediate stages of SP migration and ERP amplitude. A series of experiments demonstrates the effects on SP migration of the efferent nerves, which form a subset of fibres in the optic nerves. When the optic nerves to one half of the retina have been severed, there is a dramatic difference in the distribution of SP in areas of the retina (of the dark-adapted eye) connected with severed or intact nerves: apical versusbasal, respectively. On incubation of a light-adapted retina with 5 mmoll 21 dopamine, but not with other catecholamines or other putative neurotransmitter substances, SP migrates basally and the ERP is significantly larger than for controls. In octopuses treated with reserpine, SP stays in an apical location and the ERP remains very small, regardless of the state of adaptation and of whether the optic nerves are intact. It is concluded that dopaminergic efferents from the optic lobes effect dark-adaptational SP migration in the cephalopod retina. The arrival in the retina of efferent signals that effect adaptational changes through the mediation of dopamine is a remarkable analogue of the vertebrate system...|$|R
40|$|Macrocypridina {{lives at}} depths of 800 m, where {{residual}} daylight is very weak. It has {{a pair of}} mobile apposition compound eyes with large lenses, wide <b>rhabdoms</b> and high acceptance angles, all of which contribute to a calculated sensitivity comparable with the superposition eyes of deep-water decapod crustaceans. The axes of the 27 ommatidia in each eye are not uniformly distributed in space, with a modest acute zone in the anteroventral region. Here the interommatidial angles are about 6 °, compared with 20 ° {{at the rear of}} the eye. The eyes make two kinds of spontaneous movements: large slow rotations of up to 50 ° around a transverse axis, and a superimposed 2 Hz tremor with an amplitude of 5 °...|$|R
40|$|Butterfly eyes {{consist of}} {{three types of}} ommatidia, which {{are more or less}} {{randomly}} arranged in a spatially regular lattice. The corneal nipple array and the tapetum, optical structures that many but not all butterflies share with moths, suggest that moths are ancestral to butterflies, in agreement with molecular phylogeny. A basic set of ultraviolet-, blue- and green-sensitive receptors, encountered among nymphalid butterflies, forms the basis for trichromatic vision. Screening pigments surrounding the light-receiving <b>rhabdoms</b> can modify the spectral sensitivity of the photoreceptors so that the sensitivity peak is in the violet, yellow, red, or even deep-red, specifically in swallowtails (Papilionidae) and whites (Pieridae), thus enhancing color discriminability. The photoreceptor sensitivity spectra are presumably tuned to the wing colors of conspecific butterflies. ...|$|R
