5|$|A <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> {{behind the}} tiger shark's retina, called the tapetum lucidum, allows light-sensing cells {{a second chance}} to capture photons of visible light, {{enhancing}} vision in low-light conditions. A tiger shark generally has long fins to provide lift as the shark maneuvers through water, while the long upper tail provides bursts of speed. The tiger shark normally swims using small body movements. Its high back and dorsal fin act as a pivot, allowing it to spin quickly on its axis, though the shark's dorsal fins are distinctively close to its tail.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision. Their eyes {{are large and}} possess a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer,</b> called the tapetum lucidum, that {{improves}} low-light vision. It is possible that this layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color. They lack the opsin gene {{that would allow them}} to detect short wavelength light, which includes the colors blue and green.|$|E
5|$|Like all primates, strepsirrhine orbits (eye sockets) have a postorbital bar, a {{protective}} ring of bone {{created by a}} connection between the frontal and zygomatic bones. Both living and extinct strepsirrhines lack a thin wall of bone behind the eye, referred to as postorbital closure, which is only seen in haplorhine primates. Although the eyes of strepsirrhines point forward, giving stereoscopic vision, the orbits do not face fully forward. Among living strepsirrhines, most or all species are thought to possess a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> behind the retina of the eye, called a tapetum lucidum (consisting of riboflavin crystals), which improves vision in low light, but they lack a fovea, which improves day vision. This differs from tarsiers, which lack a tapetum lucidum but possess a fovea.|$|E

Laser light beams melt bits into {{the film to}} create data. These bits can be erased and re-recorded by adjusting {{the temperature of the}} laser.

5|$|Most lemurs have {{retained}} the tapetum lucidum, a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> of {{tissue in the}} eye, which is found in many vertebrates. This trait is absent in haplorrhine primates, and its presence further limits the visual acuity in lemurs. The strepsirrhine choroidal tapetum is unique among mammals because it {{is made up of}} crystalline riboflavin, and the resulting optical scattering is what limits visual acuity. Although the tapetum is considered to be ubiquitous in lemurs, there appear to be exceptions among true lemurs, such as the black lemur and the common brown lemur, as well as the ruffed lemurs. Since the riboflavins in the tapetum have a tendency to dissolve and vanish when processed for histological investigation, however, the exceptions are still debatable.|$|E
5|$|The European {{nightjar}} {{feeds on}} a wide variety of flying insects, which it seizes in flight, often fly-catching from a perch. It hunts by sight, silhouetting its prey against the night sky. Its eyes are relatively large, each with a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer,</b> which improves night vision. It appears not to rely on its hearing to find insects and does not echolocate. Drinking and bathing take place during flight. Although it suffers a degree of predation and parasitism, the main threats to the species are habitat loss, disturbance and a reduction of its insect prey through pesticide use. Despite population decreases, its large numbers and huge breeding range mean that it is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (<b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably equivalent to that of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E

5|$|Strepsirrhines {{are defined}} by their wet nose or rhinarium. They also have a smaller brain than comparably sized simians, large {{olfactory}} lobes for smell, a vomeronasal organ to detect pheromones, and a bicornuate uterus with an epitheliochorial placenta. Their eyes contain a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> to improve their night vision, and their eye sockets include a ring of bone around the eye, but they lack a wall of thin bone behind it. Strepsirrhine primates produce their own vitamin C, whereas haplorhine primates must obtain it from their diets. Lemuriform primates are characterized by a toothcomb, a specialized set of teeth in the front, {{lower part of the}} mouth mostly used for combing fur during grooming. Often, the toothcomb is incorrectly used to characterize all strepsirrhines. Instead, it is unique to lemuriforms and is not seen among adapiforms. Lemuriforms groom orally, and also possess a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot for scratching in areas that are inaccessible to the mouth and tongue. It is unclear whether adapiforms possessed grooming claws.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. The retina is surrounded by a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at the retina, enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E

50|$|CD-Rs/DVD-Rs (recordable) are recordable, write-once discs {{which use}} {{photosensitive}} organic dye {{just below the}} reflective layer; the dye undergoes a chemical change when exposed to specific laser light beams, creating bits (marks) containing data. Dyes used in DVD-Rs and CD-Rs include Phthalocyanine (greenish) Cyanine (blue) and Azo (dark blue). Silver, silver alloys and gold are used as <b>reflective</b> <b>layers</b> on recordable CDs and DVDs. Both gold and silver will outlast the organic dyes, which will decay over time. Aluminium is not used because it may cause reactions with the dyes.|$|R
25|$|The {{polycarbonate}} {{material and}} possible gold or {{silver in the}} <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> would make CD-Rs highly recyclable. However, the polycarbonate is of very little value and the quantity of precious metals is so small {{that it is not}} profitable to recover them. Consequently, recyclers that accept CD-Rs typically do not offer compensation for donating or transporting the materials.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, many {{manufacturers}} have added additional coloring to disguise their unstable cyanine CD-Rs in the past, so {{the formulation of}} a disc cannot be determined based purely on its color. Similarly, a gold <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> does not guarantee use of phthalocyanine dye. The quality of the disc is also not only dependent on the dye used, it is also influenced by sealing, the top layer, the <b>reflective</b> <b>layer,</b> and the polycarbonate. Simply choosing a disc based on its dye type may be problematic. Furthermore, correct power calibration of the laser in the writer, as well as correct timing of the laser pulses, stable disc speed, and so on, is critical to not only the immediate readability but the longevity of the recorded disc, so for archiving {{it is important to}} have not only a high quality disc but a high quality writer. In fact, a high quality writer may produce adequate results with medium quality media, but high quality media cannot compensate for a mediocre writer, and discs written by such a writer cannot achieve their maximum potential archival lifetime.|$|E

25|$|Since CD-Rs {{in general}} cannot be logically erased to any degree, the {{disposal}} of CD-Rs presents a possible security issue if they contain sensitive / private data. Destroying the data requires physically destroying the disc or data layer. Heating the disc in a microwave oven for 10–15 seconds effectively destroys the data layer by causing arcing in the metal <b>reflective</b> <b>layer,</b> but this same arcing may cause damage or excessive wear to the microwave oven. Many office paper shredders {{are also designed to}} shred CDs.|$|E
25|$|Adaptations {{to night}} vision include the large {{size of the}} eye, its tubular shape, large numbers of closely packed retinal rods, and an absence of cones, since cone cells are not {{sensitive}} enough for a low-photon nighttime environment. There are few coloured oil droplets, which would reduce the light intensity, but the retina contains a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer,</b> the tapetum lucidum. This increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell receives, allowing the bird to see better in low light conditions. Owls normally have only one fovea, and that is poorly developed except in diurnal hunters like the short-eared owl.|$|E
25|$|Cats, {{like dogs}} {{and many other}} animals, have a tapetum lucidum, which is a <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> behind the retina that sends light that passes through the retina back into the eye. While this {{improves}} {{the ability to see}} in darkness, it appears to reduce net visual acuity, thus detracting when light is abundant. In very bright light, the slit-like pupil closes very narrowly over the eye, reducing the amount of light on the sensitive retina, and improving depth of field. Big cats have pupils that contract to a round point. The tapetum and other mechanisms give the cat a minimum light detection threshold up to seven times lower than that of humans. Variation in color of cats' eyes in flash photographs is largely due to the reflection of the flash by the tapetum.|$|E
40|$|A system {{built on}} a <b>layered</b> <b>reflective</b> {{cognitive}} architecture presents many novel and difficult software engineering problems. Some of these problems can be ameliorated by erecting the system on a substrate that implicitly supports tracing {{the behavior of the}} system to the data and through the procedures that produced that behavior. Good traces make the system accountable; it enables the analysis of success and failure, and thus enhances the ability to learn from mistakes. This constructed substrate provides for general parallelism and concurrency, while supporting the automatic collection of audit trails for all processes, including the processes that analyze audit trails. My system natively supports a Lisp-like language. In such a language, as in machine language, a program is data that can be easily manipulated by a program, making it easier for a user or an automatic procedure to read, edit, and write programs as they are debugged. Constructed within this substrate is an implementation of the bottom four layers of an Emotion Machine cognitive architecture, including built-in reactive, learned reactive, deliberative, and <b>reflective</b> <b>layers.</b> A simple natural language planning language is presented for the deliberative control of a problem domain. Also, a number of deliberative planning algorithms are implemented in this natural planning language, allowing a recursive application of reflectively planned control. This recursion is demonstrated in a fifth super-reflective layer of planned control of the <b>reflective</b> planning <b>layer,</b> implying N <b>reflective</b> <b>layers</b> of planned control. Here, I build and demonstrate an example of reflective problem solving through the use of English plans in a block building problem domain. In my demonstration an AI model can learn from experience of success or failure. The Al not only learns about physical activities but also reflectively learns about thinking activities, refining and learning the utility of built-in knowledge. Procedurally traced memory can be used to assign credit to those thinking processes that are responsible for the failure, facilitating learning how to better plan for these types of problems in the future. by Bo Morgan.

25|$|The {{principle}} of liquid-crystal display (LCD) technology {{relies on the}} rotation of the axis of linear polarization by the liquid crystal array. Light from the backlight (or the back <b>reflective</b> <b>layer,</b> in devices not including or requiring a backlight) first passes through a linear polarizing sheet. That polarized light passes through the actual liquid crystal layer which may be organized in pixels (for a TV or computer monitor) or in another format such as a seven-segment display or one with custom symbols for a particular product. The liquid crystal layer is produced with a consistent right (or left) handed chirality, essentially consisting of tiny helices. This causes circular birefringence, and is engineered so that there is a 90 degree rotation of the linear polarization state. However, when a voltage is applied across a cell, the molecules straighten out, lessening or totally losing the circular birefringence. On the viewing side of the display is another linear polarizing sheet, usually oriented at 90 degrees from the one behind the active layer. Therefore, when the circular birefringence is removed by the application of a sufficient voltage, the polarization of the transmitted light remains at right angles to the front polarizer, and the pixel appears dark. With no voltage, however, the 90 degree rotation of the polarization causes it to exactly match the axis of the front polarizer, allowing the light through. Intermediate voltages create intermediate rotation of the polarization axis and the pixel has an intermediate intensity. Displays based on this principle are widespread, and now are used {{in the vast majority of}} televisions, computer monitors and video projectors, rendering the previous CRT technology essentially obsolete. The use of polarization in the operation of LCD displays is immediately apparent to someone wearing polarized sunglasses, often making the display unreadable.|$|E
500|$|Unlike most diurnal primates, {{but like}} all strepsirhine primates, the ring-tailed lemur has a tapetum lucidum, or <b>reflective</b> <b>layer</b> behind the retina of the eye, that enhances night vision. [...] The tapetum is highly visible in this species because the {{pigmentation}} of the ocular fundus (back surface of the eye), which is present in—but varies between—all lemurs, is very spotty. [...] The ring-tailed lemur also has a rudimentary foveal depression on the retina. [...] Another shared characteristic with the other strepsirrhine primates is the rhinarium, a moist, naked, glandular nose supported by the upper jaw and protruding beyond the chin. [...] The rhinarium continues down where it divides the upper lip. [...] The upper lip {{is attached to the}} premaxilla, preventing the lip from protruding and thus requiring the lemur to lap water rather than using suction.|$|E
2500|$|Pit eyes, {{also known}} as stemma, are eye-spots which may be set into a pit to reduce the angles of light that enters and affects the eyespot, to allow the {{organism}} to deduce the angle of incoming light.

40|$|A passive, {{economical}} {{and easy}} to assemble thermal insulation blanket {{has been designed to}} protect micro, nano and pico satellites, and their payloads as well. The structure of the Multi Layer Insulation (MLI) system has been simplified using Components Off The Shelf (COTS), so that it is composed of two types of layers: the <b>reflective</b> <b>layers</b> and the separator layers. The layers are bonded together using Kapton, glass fiber tape and a bi-adhesive tape. The <b>reflective</b> <b>layers</b> are made of Mylar polyester film, typically used in first-aid kits. The separator layers, used to prevent thermal conduction between the <b>reflective</b> <b>layers,</b> consist of a glass-fiber net used in building constructions, namely for wall plastering. The fibers are crossed together to form a mesh about 3 x 6 mm in size. Several samples have been manufactured, with the size of 22 x 22 cm, in order to fit inside the thermo-vacuum chamber of the LARES-lab at the School of Aerospace Engineering. Each sample differs from the others by the number of layers, with a maximum thickness of 2 mm. The performances of this MLI system have been evaluated. Each sample has been tested in high vacuum (< 10 − 5 mbar), and temperatures {{on both sides of the}} sample have been recorded before and during the activation of a SpectrosunXT- 10 Type II solar simulator. The test procedure, applied on all the samples, consisted in measuring the temperatures reached at the equilibrium but also in monitoring the transient during vacuum creation and during the heating of the sample. Two Platinum Resistance Thermometers were placed in the center of each side of the sample; the thermometers were fixed to the surface by means of a thermal conductive double sided adhesive tape. Two additional sensors were placed on the walls of the vacuum chamber. The highest recorded temperature on the front- facing layers of a tested specimen was 161. 9 o C. On some specimens, temperature differences of about 95 o C have been recorded between the layer facing the Sun simulator and the opposite one (in shadow). Heat transfer was reduced through the use of a larger number of layers in the sample, as well as by varying the front surface emissivity. The tests demonstrated that the COTS-composed MLI system has both good insulation properties and good resistance in space environment. This paper will describe the manufacturing procedures, the characteristics of the MLI systems used, the experimental set-up and the relevant results...|$|R
