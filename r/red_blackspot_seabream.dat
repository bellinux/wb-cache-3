40|$|<b>Blackspot</b> <b>seabream,</b> Pagellus bogaraveo (Brunnich), {{has been}} {{identified}} as a potential species to diversify European aquaculture production. Although rearing aspects have been widely investigated, little information exists on the nutritional requirements for this species. The aim {{of this study was to}} build up information on the activity of digestive enzymes at certain developmental stages of <b>blackspot</b> <b>seabream</b> in order to understand the nutritional needs of larvae and post larvae. Fish larvae were reared from hatching to 55 days after hatching (dah), and the feeding plan consisted in rotifers (5 – 35 dah), Artemia naupli (30 – 35 dah) metanaupli (35 – 45) and Gemma microdiet (45 – 55 dah). At 7, 11, 21, 45 and 55 days after hatching (dah), pooled samples of fish larvae were collected for analysis of trypsin, amylase, lipase, alkaline phosphatase and leucine–alanine peptidase activity. Up to 21 dah, the whole larvae body was used for enzymatic analysis, whereas in older larvae only the dissected abdominal cavity was used. <b>Blackspot</b> <b>seabream</b> body dry weight growth was exponential, increasing from 60 μg at 5 dah to 30 ± 9. 7 mg at 55 dah. Amylase specific activity decreased significantly during development, exhibiting at 11 dah (0. 6 U mg− 1 protein) an average value 2. 7 times lower than at 7 dah, and remaining stable between 45 and 55 dah (0. 7 U mg protein− 1). Trypsin specific activity remained constant until 21 dah (between 38 and 44 mU mg protein− 1), which could be related to the larvae feeding regime. At later stages of development, lipase-specific activity exhibited a significant increase (P< 0. 05), being three times higher at 55 dah (8 U mg protein− 1) than at 45 dah. The total activity of the studied digestive enzymes increased significantly during larval development (until 21 dah), whereas afterwards only lipase and leucine–alanine peptidase increased significantly between 45 and 55 dah.

Furthermore, the emerging pattern points to a more complex spatial behaviour than previously anticipated, suggesting a seasonal switch in the diel behaviour mode (benthic vs. pelagic) of seabream, which may reflect an adaptation to differences in prey availability.

The following parameters were estimated in transversal body sections at post-opercular and post-anal body levels: the total cross-sectional muscle area, {{the total number}} of fibres and the mean cross-sectional fibre area. At hatching, no significant influence of the temperature was observed on the morphometric parameters measured in the white muscle.

In conclusion, the axial musculature of <b>blackspot</b> <b>seabream</b> embryos/larvae reacted differently to temperature influence according to the body location, strongly supporting the need to look at and account for different body locations when evaluating muscle cellularity in fish, namely in growth/aquaculture-related studies...|$|R
40|$|Deepwater {{fish are}} {{characterized}} by long lifespans, late maturity and low productivity. This implies slow recovery from low biomass levels and it is, therefore, important to manage these stocks correctly to avoid overfishing. However, these stocks are generally data poor, which it makes difficult to apply quantitative assessment models {{on which to base}} their management. The management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach consists in evaluating the performance of management strategies by simulation before their implementation. In the evaluation, the main sources of uncertainty in a fishery system and its management process should be taken into account in order to find robust management strategies. Thus, the MSE approach is relevant to the management of data-poor stocks. We used the FLBEIA software, an FLR library coded in the R statistical language, to conduct a bio-economic impact assessment of fisheries management strategies.

In trial 1, the minimum concentration of anaesthetic producing the total loss of muscular tone within 3 min, and recovery within 10 min, was determined. The obtained results showed that MS- 222 and clove oil were effective as anaesthetics for juveniles of blackspot sea-bream and greater amberjack at concentrations of 40 and 100 mg L- 1, respectively. The aim of trial 2 was to assess the side-effects of both anaesthetics on greater amberjack juveniles by monitoring serum cortisol and glucose levels, and haematocrit values. No significant differences between anaesthetics were found for most of the measured physiological variables. The second part of research (trial 3) was designed to establish the ability of anaesthesia to mitigate stress responses blocking activation of the HPI axis associated to handling stress. In this trial, the stress responses to handling of adult blackspot sea-bream anaesthetised with either anaesthetics were compared to those of unanaesthetised fish used as controls.

A total of 12 benthopelagic fish species (five chondrichthyes and seven osteichthyes) were identified. The <b>blackspot</b> <b>seabream</b> (Pagellus bogaraveo) was the most often observed fish species. The depth of 787 m represents a new depth record for this fish in the Adriatic Sea. Groups of up to 40 individuals of P. bogaraveo were attracted to the bait and were shown in single frames. The individuals were observed both exploring the area and feeding actively on the bait. The European conger (Conger conger) was recorded at each deployment. Clear scavenger behaviour was also observed in this teleost fish and in the shark Etmopterus spinax.

They are located between 350 and 1100 m in depth, {{in the northern}} Ionian Sea (eastern-central Mediterranean). Using a multi-beam echo sounder, side-scan sonar, high-resolution seismics and underwater video, the zones were identified for the sampling demersal fauna without damaging the coral colonies. During September-October 2005 experimental samplings were carried out with longlines and trawl nets inside the coral habitat and outside, where fishery exploitation occurs. No significant differences were shown between the abundance of fish recorded using longlines in the coral and non-coral habitat even though some selachians and teleosts were more abundant in the former than in the latter. Large specimens of rockfish (Helicolenus dactylopterus) and <b>blackspot</b> <b>seabream</b> (Pagellus bogaraveo) were commonly caught using longlines in the coral habitat. Data from trawling revealed refuge effects in the coral habitat and fishing effects outside. Significant differences were detected between the recorded abundances in the two study areas. Greater densities and biomasses were obtained inside the coral area, and fish size spectra and size distributions indicate a greater abundance of large fish inside the coral habitat. The SML coral habitat is a spawning area for H. dactylopterus. The remarkable density of the young-of-the-year of the deep-water shark Ennopterus spinax {{as well as of}} Merluccius merluccius, Micromesistius poutassou, Phycis blennoides and H. dactylopterus, indicates that the coral habitat also acts as nursery area for these demersal species, which are exploited outside. Considering the evidence of the negative impact of bottom trawling and, to a lesser extent, of longlining, the coral banks can provide a refuge for the conservation of unique species and habitats as well as in providing benefit to adjacent fisheries through the spill-over effect both of eggs, larvae, juveniles and adults.

40|$|Intensive {{aquaculture}} {{is heavily}} dependent on high-quality fishmeal to meet their protein requirements. However, due to the increased demand, decreased availability, raising costs and the potential presence of organic and inorganic contaminants, it is of economical and environmental interest to replace fishmeal by a renewable protein sources. This is particularly challenging since replacing fishmeal may lack appropriate chemical stimulants for active consumption. Fish have a well-defined olfactory sensitivity to L-amino acids (Hara, 1994), and this phenomenon is generally held {{to be involved in}} the location and identification of food (Carr et al., 1996). Olfactory sensitivity in fish can be assessed by electro-olfactogram (EOG); a field potential recorded from just above the olfactory epithelium (Scott and Scott-Johnson, 2002). Due to the high electrical conductivity of seawater, EOG responses recorded in marine fish are, however, of lower amplitude than those recorded in freshwater fish (Silver et al., 1976). It is unclear, however, to what extent EOG recording in seawater may underestimate the olfactory sensitivity of a given species when compared to more invasive recording methods, such as multi-unit recording from the olfactory nerve. The <b>blackspot</b> <b>seabream</b> is a promising new species for the finfish aquaculture industry; however, little is known about its biology. The current study investigated its olfactory sensitivity to amino acids and compared the efficacy of two different experimental approaches: multi-unit recording from the olfactory nerve and the electro-olfactogram (EOG).
