40|$|Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China [2011 J 01244]In this study, the {{complete}} mitochondrial (mt) genome of the <b>rock</b> <b>grouper</b> Epinephelus fasciatomaculosus was determined. The circular mtDNA molecule was 16, 682 bp {{in size and}} the overall nucleotide composition of the H-strand was 28. 64 % A, 27. 21 % T, 16. 28 % G and 27. 87 % C, with an A + T bias. The complete mitogenome encoded 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNAs, 22 tRNAs and two major non-coding regions, with the gene order and content identical to other vertebrate mitogenomes. E. fasciatomaculosus {{is similar to the}} sympatric Epinephelus akaara in external morphology. Similarity of {{the complete}} mitogenomes between E. fasciatomaculosus and E. akaara was 91. 45 %, and the motif of the control region in E. fasciatomaculosus differed in the number of tandem repeat elements from that in E. akaara, which revealed the significant identity of the two species at molecular levels...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the nutrient digestibility coefficient of diet with diertary levels of protein and lipid on coral <b>rock</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus corallicola) juvenile. This study used completely randomized design with factorial arranged in 3 different treatment of dietary protein levels i. e., 36 %, 42 %, and 48 %;and 2 different treatment of dietary lipid levels i. e., 9 % and 18 %; with 3 repetition. The average initial body weight of fishes for this study was 29. 19 ± 0. 97 g/fish. Fishes were reared in 18 pieces of polycarbonate tank with water volume of 30 liters with stocked density of 7 fishes/tank. The tank equipped with aeration with water flow change of 20 liters/hour. Fish were fed 2 times per day on at satiation and fish rearing for 150 days. Parameters measured were protein, lipid, carbohydrate and energy of digestibility coefficient. The results showed that the interaction of protein and lipid levels that differ in feed ratio significantly affected on protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and energy digestibility coefficients. In general, feed with a protein content of 36 % and 9 % lipid produced good nutrient digestibility coefficient and better economic value...|$|E
