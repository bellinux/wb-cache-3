50|$|Much of {{the current}} {{research}} is into reducing the cycle time, as well as improving part quality. The most promising area is in mold pressurization. It {{is well known that}} applying a small amount of pressure internally to the mold at the correct point in the heating phase accelerates coalescence of the polymer particles during the melting, producing a part with fewer bubbles in less time than at atmospheric pressure. This pressure delays the separation of the part from the mold wall due to shrinkage during the cooling phase, aiding cooling of the part. The main drawback to this is the danger to the operator of explosion of a pressurized part. This has prevented adoption of mold pressurization on a large scale by <b>rotomolding</b> manufacturers.|$|E

40|$|Antistatic {{polymers}} {{are required}} to dissipate static charges safely from component surfaces. Our overall objective has been to develop cost-effective flame-retarded and antistatic polyethylene compounds suitable for <b>rotomolding.</b> This communication considers the surface resistivity and mechanical properties of rotationally molded linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) /graphite composites containing natural Zimbabwean graphite, expandable graphite, or expanded graphite. Dry blending and melt compounding were employed to obtain antistatic composites at the lowest graphite contents. Dry blending {{was found to be}} an effective mixing method for <b>rotomolding</b> antistatic LLDPE/graphite composites, thereby eliminating an expensive compounding step. Dry-blended Zimbabwean graphite composites showed the lowest surface resistivity at all graphite contents, with a surface resistivity of 105 Ω/square at 10 wt% loading. Although rotomolded powders obtained following the melt compounding of Zimbabwean graphite exhibited higher resistivity values, the variability was much lower. Injection molding resulted in surface resistivity values above 1014 Ω/square for all compositions used. The rotomolded composites exhibited poor mechanical properties, in contrast to injection-molded composites. The Halpin-Tsai model showed good fits to the tensile modulus data for injection-molded Zimbabwean and expandable graphite.

This project concentrates on studying the <b>rotomolding</b> being used in the company, and a new alternative of using induction heating to replace the diesel furnace heating has been suggested. Experimental results and comparisons in processing time, energy cost and working conditions are given in this report. Based on the results, it was found that the new induction heating could save 50 % of the energy cost, and the processing time was trimmed down from more than 5 minutes to 2. 5 minutes per doll head produced. Moreover, a hypothesis was also proposed for the bi-axial rotation calculations and this can greatly help the launching of new products as trial-and-error is the current approach being used for new setup determinations.

40|$|Rotational molding is {{a process}} used to {{manufacture}} hollow plastic products, and has been heralded as a molding method with great potential. Reduction of cycle times {{is an important issue}} for the rotational molding industry, addressing a significant disadvantage of the process. Previous attempts to reduce cycle times have addressed surface enhanced molds, internal pressure, internal cooling, water spray cooling, and higher oven air flow rates within the existing process. This article explores the potential benefits of these cycle time reduction techniques, and combinations of them. Recommendations on a best practice combination are made, based on experimental observations and resulting product quality. Applying the proposed molding conditions (i. e., a combination of surface-enhanced molds, higher oven flow rates, internal mold pressure, and water spray cooling), cycle time reductions of up to 70 % were achieved. Such savings are very significant, inviting the <b>rotomolding</b> community to incorporate these techniques efficiently in an industrial setting...|$|E

50|$|Contemporary traditional-style kayaks {{trace their}} origins {{primarily}} to the native boats of Alaska, northern Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were first introduced in the US, and inflatable rubberized fabric boats were first introduced in Europe. <b>Rotomolded</b> plastic kayaks first appeared in 1973, and most kayaks today are made from roto-molded polyethylene resins.

5000|$|The rigid buoyant boat (RBB) is a {{light-weight}} {{but high}} performance and high capacity boat. Based {{on the concept}} of a Rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), it has a tube/sponson manufactured from a solid material such as moulded polyethylene or aluminium and therefore being much more robust than the fabrics commonly used. Boats with foam filled collars such as the secure all-around flotation equipped (SAFE) boats employed by the US Coast Guard can also be classified as Rigid Buoyant Boats rather than [...] "true" [...] RHIBs as the collar is solid foam rather than inflated. The handling tends to be very similar to a RHIB; likewise they will remain afloat (buoyant) even if completely flooded. Aluminium RBBs tend to be bespoke (custom-made to specification) or low-volume products whilst the tooling cost of <b>rotomolded</b> polyethylene boats tends to require these to be higher volume products. At least three manufacturers are producing <b>rotomolded</b> boats of this type. One supplier has demonstrated the robustness of the boats by dropping one from a crane onto a concrete car park. The U.S. Navy’s small unit riverine craft and the Coast Guard’s Defender class 25 ft boats are examples of RBBs. Some boat builders make RBB's as workboat from HDPE sheets welded together. Similar deep V-hull can be made for good seakeeping. If buoyancy chambers are filled the hull becomes truly unsinkable and extremely indestructible making the RBB very suitable for rough conditions. The RBB serie of Tideman Boats is a good example.|$|R
25|$|Contemporary sea kayaks {{trace their}} origin {{to the native}} boats of Alaska, {{northern}} Canada, and Southwest Greenland. Eskimo hunters developed a fast seagoing craft to hunt seals and walrus. The ancient Aleut name for a sea kayak is Iqyak, and earliest models were constructed from a light wooden frame (tied together with sinew or baleen) and covered with sea mammal (sea lion or seal) hides. Archaeologists have found evidence indicating that kayaks are at least 4000 years old. Wooden kayaks and fabric kayaks on wooden frames (such as the Klepper) dominated the market up until the 1950s, when fiberglass boats were introduced. <b>Rotomolded</b> plastic kayaks first appeared in 1984.|$|R

The chassis were developed by Hydro Aluminium Tonder in Tønder in Denmark and {{were one of the}} main reasons that Ford later acquired 51% of the stock. 10 of 15 prototypes were built in time for the Lillehammer Olympic Winter Games in 1994. The battery technology was NiCd, driving a three-phase AC induction motor via the front wheels.|$|R
50|$|White water racers {{combine a}} fast, {{unstable}} lower hull portion with a flared upper hull portion to combine flat water racing speed with extra stability in open water: {{they are not}} fitted with rudders and have similar maneuverability to flat water racers. They usually require substantial skill to achieve stability, due to extremely narrow hulls. Whitewater racing kayaks, like all racing kayaks, are made to regulation lengths, usually of fiber reinforced resin (usually epoxy or polyester reinforced with Kevlar, glass fiber, carbon fiber, or some combination). This form of construction is stiffer and has a harder skin than non-reinforced plastic construction such as <b>rotomolded</b> polyethylene: stiffer means faster, and harder means fewer scratches and therefore also faster.|$|R
5000|$|A {{recreational}} kayak {{is a type}} of kayak that {{is designed}} for the casual paddler interested in recreational activities on a lake or flatwater stream; they presently make up the largest segment of kayak sales. Compared to other kayaks, recreational kayaks are characterized by having a larger cockpit opening for easy entry and exit and a wider beam (27 - 30 inches) for more stability on the water and are generally less than twelve feet in length, which makes them slower than a longer boat would be, but lighter, easier to handle {{in and out of the}} water, and less expensive. Due to the wider hull, recreational kayaks will not track (maintain a straight line) as well as longer, narrower models. They generally have limited cargo carrying capacity. Using less expensive materials like <b>rotomolded</b> polyethylene and including fewer options helps keep these boats inexpensive.|$|R
50|$|As {{compared}} to the other big kayaks, a recreational kayak has characteristics which are different like a larger cockpit that is easy to open, make an entry and exit from. It has a wider beam of about 27-30 inches for more stability in water and is generally less than 12 feet in length. This smaller dimensions of the recreational kayak makes it smaller than a longer boat. As {{compared to}} the big kayaks, a recreational kayak is light, and thus it is easier to handle {{both in and out of}} water. This recreational kayak is cheaper as compared to a big kayak. Since the recreational kayak has a wider hull, recreational kayaks will not track lines, especially straight lines as compared to longer and narrower models. A recreational kayak has limited cargo carrying capacity as compared to a huge kayak. The materials used to manufacture the recreational kayak is <b>rotomolded</b> polyethylene which is less expensive and has fever options. Recreational kayaks are generally used for fishing.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results are}} {{presented}} concerning the use of less-toxic plasticizers such as dioctyl adipate (DOA) and acetyl tributyl citrate (ATBC) in plastisol formulations for rotational molding technology.
