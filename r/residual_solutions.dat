The other complementary class correspond to the Papkovich-Fadle Eigenfunction solutions for isotropic rectangular strips and is designated as the <b>residual</b> <b>solutions.</b> For sufficiently thin plates, the latter exhibits rapid exponen-tial decay away from the plate edges. A set of first integrals of the elasticity equations is also derived.

The requirement of rapid exponential decay effectively limits their applicability to thin plates.

40|$|International audienceThe crystal {{structure}} and crystal chemistry of dioctahedral smectites in high enthalpy geothermal systems was investigated through 2 wells drilled in the Bouillante geothermal area {{in order to}} understand the factors which control their vertical variation. Smectites were examined by optical and scanning electron microscopy, electron microprobe analysis, X-ray diffraction (after Ca, Li, alkylammonium saturations), Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (after Li, NH 4 + saturations) and oxygen isotope analysis. Smectites predominate within the upper part of the drill holes (up to 260 m depth - temperature range : 67 - 160 °C). The XRD, FTIR and punctual chemical analysis clearly demonstrate a transition from montmorillonite to beidellite with increasing depth and temperature which proceeded through interstratification of beidellite-like and montmorillonite-like layers. Montmorillonite predominates at temperatures lower than 100 °C while beidellite predominates between 110 and 170 °C. However, this transition is not explained by a thermally controlled beidellitization process but seems related to the hydrothermal solutions from which precipitated these smectites. The δ 18 O values of the equilibrated fluids indicate that beidellitic smectite precipitated from the hot geothermal fluid associated with minor amounts of <b>residual</b> <b>solutions</b> resulting from local boiling and that montmorillonitic smectite precipitated from reacting solutions whose origin has to be searched in the phreatic water table associated with minor amounts of liquids resulting from the condensation of vapors escaped from the boiling zones.

40|$|We {{present the}} BEDFix (Bisection Envelope Deep-cut Fixed point) {{algorithm}} {{for the problem}} of ap-proximating a fixed point of a function of two variables. The function must be Lipschitz continuous with constant 1 {{with respect to the}} infinity norm; such functions are commonly found in economics and game theory. The computed approximation satisfies a residual criterion given a specified er-ror tolerance. The BEDFix algorithm improves the BEFix algorithm presented in Shellman and Sikorski [2002] by utilizing “deep cuts, ” that is, eliminating additional segments of the feasible domain which cannot contain a fixed point. The upper bound on the number of required function evaluations is the same for BEDFix and BEFix, but our numerical tests indicate that BEDFix significantly improves the average-case performance. In addition, we show how BEDFix may be used to solve the absolute criterion fixed point problem with significantly better performance than the simple iteration method, when the Lipschitz constant is less than but close to 1. BEDFix is highly efficient when used to compute <b>residual</b> <b>solutions</b> for bivariate functions, having a bound on function evaluations that is twice the logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance. In the tests described in this article, the number of evaluations performed by the method averaged 31 percent of this worst-case bound. BEDFix works for nonsmooth continuous functions, unlike methods that require gradient information; also, it handles functions with minimum Lipschitz constants equal to 1, whereas the complexity of simple iteration approaches infinity as the minimum Lipschitz con-stant approaches 1. When BEDFix is used to compute absolute criterion solutions, the worst-case complexity depends on the logarithm of the reciprocal of 1 -q, where q is the Lipschitz constant, {{as well as on the}} logarithm of the reciprocal of the tolerance...|$|E

Plate 1 : Geology of the La Prosperidad Area (in pocket) Plate 2 : Geology of the La Prosperidad Deposit (in pocket) Plate 3 : Columnar Sections of the La Prosperidad Deposit (in pocket) Plate 4 : Magnetic Contour Map and Locations Grid of the La Prosperidad Deposit (in pocket) The La Prosperidad banded {{ferromanganese}} deposit, {{in central}} Baja California Norte, Mexico, is enclosed by Mesozoic marine arc volcanic-sedimentary rocks. A dome-like dacite porphyry footwall and a hanging wall of interbedded tuffs, tuffaceous shales and rhyodacite flows are contemporaneous with the deposit. Detailed geologic mapping indicates these rocks were deposited {{in a highly}} restricted marine or lacustrian basin which formed following the emplacement of a large rhyolite ash flow. The deposit occurs as a steep dipping 3 m thick, by 360 m long outcrop of thin and rhythmic laminated Fe and Mn oxides. Subaqueous chemical precipitation {{is suggested by the}} high continuity of these strikingly distinct lamelli. The deposit's trace element enrichments (Sb, As, W[?], Zn ?? Ge, Co, Ba, Mo, V, Sr, Cu, Nb, Be) match those of present day Mn hot spring aprons and ancient syngenetic Mn deposits associated with silicic volcanism. Metal distribution within the deposit indicates adsorbtion on Mn and Fe oxides was an important mechanism of precipitation in a depositional basin that physiochemically was essentially homogeneous. This mode of precipitation was interrupted once by the rapid emplacement of an ash-rich unit and numerous times when hot spring activity decreased and thin travertine layers precipitated. Diagenesis and upper greenschist facies metamorphism caused complete recrystallization; however, their large scale effects on ore textures and compositions were minimal. More significant redistributions were produced by hydrothermal overprinting and supergene alteration. The La Prosperidad deposit belongs to the meta-volcanic mineral province of Baja California. However, the province is better characterized by deposits of Fe and Cu, formed mainly by contact metasomatic processes. Although {{it is possible that the}} La Prosperidad deposit was partially derived from surfacing Mn-rich <b>residual</b> <b>solutions</b> produced by the formation of a contact metasomatic Fe deposit at depth, most, if not all, of the Fe-Mn oxides probably were leached directly from the volcanic rocks underlying the La Prosperidad deposit by heated connate water and/or ground water...|$|E

40|$|The acid minor {{bodies in}} the mansehra and Batgram area were emplaced in the {{granitic}} rocks and the associated met sediments. These bodies {{have been identified as}} (i) Albities, (2) albiteaplites/pegmatites, (3) ablate-(microcline) -aplites /pegmatites, (4) alit-microcline-aplites/tit/pegmatites, (5) microcline-albiteaplies/pegatites and (6) complex aplites/pegmatites. The first 4 types occur as independent and composite {{bodies in the}} interior-lateral zone (1750 to 5500 feet above sea level), types 4 and 5 occur in the interior-marginal zone (5000 to 9000 feet above sea level) and types 5 and 6 are present in both interior-marginal zone and marginal â€“ exterior zone (over 9000 feet sea level). Field, mineralogical and chemical evidences show that the acid minor bodies are genetically related with the granitic rocks of the area. This genetic relationship is significant due to continued enrichment of soda in the granites from susalgali granitic gneiss (a potassic facies) to Hackle tourmaline granite and chail sar micro granite. The enrichment of soda is due to gradual cooling and increases in vapor pressure of the complex (in tightly closed environments) more than to kbs, where the acidic fluids shifted toward the albite apex. From this the release in external pressure at within the interior-lateral zone gave rise to soda rich liquids being deposited in the fissures. These fissures provided the local in pressure by the opening the metasodiuments during the welling up and the expansion of the granites in the diapiric and much room like structures. Therefore, as the vapour pressure decreased with further cooling, the behavior of the system was reversed gradually, meaning thereby that quantity depended on the release in p(H 2 o) in the three structural zones. The mineralogy and chemistry of these structural units is quite contrasting with the exception of some overlapping at places. Therefore, the present investigations show that the pegmatite <b>residual</b> <b>solutions</b> were derived from the albite rich solutions gradually with the introduction of k 2 o and volatiles. This derivation is excellently exemplified by negative correlation of Na 2 o and positive correlation of k 2 o with Si 02 and gradual but significant increase in the rare elements...|$|E
40|$|The Libros Gypsum is the {{thickest}} evaporite {{unit of the}} Miocene infill of the Teruel Basin in NE Spain. During the deposition of this unit, intense bacterial sulfate-reducing (BSR) activity in the lake depocenter generated a native sulfur deposit. Diagenetic gypsum resulted from subsequent sulfur oxidation. The different processes involved in these transformations were first investigated by Anadón et al. (1992). The present paper is concerned with this diagenetic gypsum from the stratigraphic, petrographic, isotopic and genetic points of view. Diagenetic gypsum occurs mainly as continuous or discontinuous layers, individual levels or lenses, irregular masses, nodules and micronodules, and veins. Its main textures are coarse-crystalline anhedral and fine-grained (alabastrine), both of which can replace any former lithology (carbonate, gypsum, and sulfur). The following sequence of processes and mineral/textural transformations is deduced: primary gypsum deposition - BSR and biodiagenetic carbonate/H 2 S production - growth of native sulfur - growth of diagenetic gypsum - partial recrystallization of the diagenetic gypsum textures. The gypsification of the native sulfur generated two types of banded structures in the diagenetic gypsum: (1) concentric structures of centripetal growth, and (2) expansive, roughly concentric structures. In the first type, the gypsification operated from the outer boundaries towards the inner parts. In the second type, part of the carbonate hosting the sulfur was also gypsified (replaced/cemented). In the diagenetic gypsum, the δ 34 S values are in agreement with a native sulfur and H 2 S provenance. The δ 18 Osulfate values, however, enable us to differentiate two main groups of values: one with positive values {{and the other with}} negative values. In the group of positive values, interstitial (evaporated) solutions participated in the sulfur oxidation; this process presumably occurred in a first oxidation stage during shallow-to-deeper burial of the Libros Gypsum unit. In the group of negative values, however, only meteoric waters participated in the oxidation, which presumably occurred in a second oxidation stage during the final exhumation of the unit. A third group of values is characterized by very high sulfur and oxygen values, suggesting that BSR <b>residual</b> <b>solutions</b> also participated in the oxidation processes locally. During the two oxidation stages, both the textural characteristics and the isotopic composition of the diagenetic gypsum indicate that gypsification operated as a multistadic process. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|A new on-line gas-permeation {{system was}} {{developed}} to enhance the efficiency and stability of gas permeation for a long time, and {{was applied to the}} determination of ammonium ion in river-water samples by the flow- injection method. The proposed gas-permeation system consists of a newly designed gas-permeation unit, a sample injection valve, a reaction coil and two six-way rotary valves in a constant-temperature oven. The gas- permeation unit was assembled using an inner micro porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane tubing and an outer glass tube, which could be easily connected with one another using connectors with ferrules and o-rings. A sample solution was injected into a carrier containing 0. 02 M sodium hydroxide, in which ammonium ion was converted to gaseous ammonia. The gaseous ammonia generated in the carrier passed through the micro porous PTFE membrane, was absorbed in a reagent solution and changed the pH of the reagent solution, which resulted in a color change to cresol red. The absorbance change of cresol red at 550 nm was measured using a visible detector with a flow cell (8 μl, 10 mm path). After the measurement, two six-way rotary valves were switched over from the flowing state to the drain state of the gas-permeation unit, and the <b>residual</b> <b>solutions</b> in the gas-permeation unit were removed and the PTFE membrane tubing was dried. By keeping the temperature of the oven at 40 ℃, the sensitivity and the reproducibility for the determination of ammonium ion was improved. Furthermore, the efficiency of gas permeation through the inner tubing could be kept high and constant for a long period without any procedure for reactivating the porous PTFE membrane tubing. Calibration graphs for ammonium ion were liner over ranges of 0 to 10 ppm and 0 to 1. 0 ppm of N-NH(4) (+), and the sampling rate was 30 samples per hour. The detection limit for N-NH(4) (+) was about 0. 01 ppm when the effective length of the membrane tubing was 5 cm. By using the proposed FIA system, ammonium ion in river-water samples was determined. The analytical results obtained by the proposed method showed a good correlation with those obtained using the indophenol derivatization/FIA method. The relative standard deviations of ten injections were 0. 51 % and 0. 83 % with concentrations of 2. 73 ppm and 4. 11 ppm, respectively. The recoveries of ammonium ion were found to be 97 ～ 98 %. ガス透過分離におけるガス透過の長期間の安定性と高効率化,更にガス透過効率の長期間の再現性を向上させた,新しいオンラインガス透過システムを構築した. このシステムでは新しく設計・製作したガス透過ユニットを組み込み,ユニット中を溶液が下方から上方に流れるようにし,気泡の発生を防ぐ工夫がほどこされ,更に測定後にガス透過ユニット内に滞留する溶液を排除するために 2 個の六方切り替えバルブを内蔵させている. ガスの安定的透過のために温度制御できる小型恒温槽を装着した. この装置中にガス透過ユニット,アンモニウムイオン定量用の反応コイルなどを組み入れ,精密測定の向上を目指した. ガス透過ユニットは,多孔質ポリテトラフルオロエチレン(PTFE) チューブとガラス管からなり,接続には樹脂製フェラル及びO-リングを用い,組み立てを容易にし,デッドボリュームも小さくした. ガス透過ユニット,反応コイル及び試料注入器などを恒温槽の中で一定温度に保つことにより,安定した再現性の良い測定が可能となった. ガス透過ユニット内に滞留する溶液を簡単かつ迅速に強制排除する機能も備えており,測定後はガス透過ユニット中の溶液を除いておくことにより,多孔質チューブの透過性能が長期間維持され,再活性化の操作をすることなく,高いガス透過効率を維持することができた. 本システムを用いると,検量線は 0 ～ 10, 0 ～ 1. 0 ppmの範囲で良好な直線性を示し, 1 時間当たり 30 試料の分析が可能となった. 実際に,河川水中のアンモニウムイオンの定量を行ったところ,インドフェノール誘導体/FIA/吸光光度法による定量値と良く一致し,試料に対する相対標準偏差は 0. 51, 0. 83 %で,回収率は 97 ～ 98 %と良好であった...|$|E

3000|$|... 5 -Hydroxymethylfurfural [HMF] is an {{important}} intermediate compound for fine chemicals. It is often obtained via hydrothermal treatment of biomass-derived carbohydrates, such as fructose, glucose and sucrose. This study investigates the formation of carbonaceous spheres from HMF created by dehydration of fructose under hydrothermal conditions. The carbonaceous spheres, ranging between 0.4 and 10 μm in diameter, have granulated morphologies both {{on the surface and}} in the interior. The <b>residual</b> <b>solution</b> is found to contain a massive number of primary nanoparticles. The chemical structure of the carbonaceous spheres was characterised by means of FTIR and NMR spectroscopies. Based on these observations, a mechanism involving the formation and aggregation of the nanoparticles is proposed. This mechanism differs considerably from the conventional understanding in the open literature.|$|R
