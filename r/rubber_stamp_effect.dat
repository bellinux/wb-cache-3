40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{polydimethylsiloxane}} (PDMS) oligomer diffusion occurring when contacting PDMS rubber against another material. Several surface analysis techniques (ToF-SIMS, XPS, contact angle measurement, AFM, SEM, interferential polarized microscopy: Sarfus) {{are used to}} characterize surfaces {{that have been in}} contact with noninked PDMS <b>rubber</b> <b>stamps.</b> While the <b>effect</b> of several parameters such as time of contact and ageing of prepatterned surfaces seem to give comprehensible effects on the oligomer deposition, other parameters such as the stamp's shape give paradoxical but reproducible results on the deposited quantity. The results provide us with {{a better understanding of the}} transfer and diffusion of PDMS oligomers on certain types of substrates (Al, SiO 2). In addition to establishing a better control of the side effects in microcontact printing, this study suggests applications that take advantage of oligomer diffusion. In particular, the capability of using PDMS transfer on a metallic surface to protect selected areas from chemical etching is assessed. In this context, oligomers are no longer harmful contaminants but the actual ink needed for a soft-lithographic process. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

50|$|As <b>rubber</b> <b>stamping</b> {{increasingly}} gains popularity, {{mostly in}} the United States, it also gains a reputation as an art form. Some participants choose to carve their own <b>rubber</b> <b>stamps,</b> either of old-fashioned gum erasers or eraser-like rubber. Companies like Speedball or MasterCarve supply carving sets to amateurs wishing to carve their own <b>rubber</b> <b>stamps,</b> with some including linocut tools.

5000|$|A {{notary seal}} of the <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> type is {{required}} to be affixed to all notarized paper documents. The <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> must include the commissioned name of the notary public, the words [...] "Notary Public-State of Florida", the notary's commission number, and the date on which the notary's commission expires. Prior to the mid-1970s, the only statutory requirement regarding notarial seals was that one be used and that it include the words [...] "Notary Public" [...] and [...] "State of Florida at Large"; {{the name of the}} notary was optional, and the law did not specify what types of seals were permissible. This law was later amended to state that the seal must be round in design and of either the <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> or impression type. In the early 1990s, the statute was again changed to require a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> seal, with an impression type seal being optional and not acceptable unless used in conjunction with a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp.</b> However, many notaries continue to use the impression seal with their <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> to allow for easy detection when trying to determine which document is an original. This process is made more difficult for notaries who only use a <b>rubber</b> <b>stamp</b> seal, as the Florida statutes require that the seal be affixed in only photographically-reproducible black ink.|$|R
