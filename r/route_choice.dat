5000|$|<b>Route</b> <b>choice</b> is {{a tactic}} in orienteering and related {{sports such as}} rogaining and {{adventure}} racing. These sports involve navigation from one control point to the next and, in most cases, the choice of route is left to the competitor. This is provided the rules permit <b>route</b> <b>choice</b> and the course is designed so that a choice exists. In trail orienteering and European style mounted orienteering <b>route</b> <b>choice</b> is not permitted. In United States style foot orienteering, <b>route</b> <b>choice</b> is absent from White courses, limited in Yellow courses, and a crucial element {{in the design of}} more advanced courses. [...] Given a choice of route, the competitor evaluates trade-offs among such factors as distance, amount of [...] "climb" [...] (vertical movement), degree and extent of [...] "fight" [...] (travel through obstructing vegetation), mode of travel, technical difficulty, and the competitor's own preferences.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} {{is aimed at}} investigating the effect of accuracy of ATIS (Advanced Traveller Information Systems) in terms of <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> and travellers concordance to informative system. A Stated Preference Experiment has been made by using a Travel Simulator developed at the Technische Universiteit of Delft (The Netherlands). During the experiment respondents {{have been asked to}} make repeated <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> in presence of ATIS. Two kinds of information have been tested: descriptive (respondents are provided with the estimated travel times on each route), and prescriptive (respondents are provided with the estimated shortest route). For each kind of information four levels of accuracy have been considered: high, low and two intermediate levels. The main research aims are: 1. investigating the relationship between accuracy of information and travellers concordance to informative system; 2. investigating the relationship between accuracy of information and <b>route</b> <b>choices.</b> Some preliminary aggregate and statistical analyses have been made; additionally, collected data have been deeply analyzed, and a fuzzy logic approach has been applied in order to reproduce the travellers behaviour...|$|R
30|$|With {{reference}} to the experimental context described in Section  2, {{in this paper we}} analyse: a) the number of trials required to make the respondents familiar with the network and the ATIS; b) the effect of different kinds of information and different levels of reliability on travellers’ compliance and on <b>route</b> <b>choices.</b> In particular, we analyse whether in the first phase (without information) the travellers become familiar with the travel time distributions, and whether in the second phase (with information) they become familiar with ATIS reliability. We then explore the relationship between reliability {{on the one hand and}} compliance and <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> on the other.|$|R

First, the paper formulates a freight network model that captures decisions and interactions of ocean carriers and port terminal operators in the maritime freight transport system. Then, the emission cost is calculated based on an activity-based approach as a component of the ocean transportation cost function. A case study is examined to find if the emission cost affects ocean <b>route</b> <b>choices.</b> The results indicate that the optimal ocean route and transportation cost are changed distinctively due to the emission cost. The research discusses how the emission cost plays a role in route changes and why ocean carriers have to consider these costs in their routing decisions...|$|R

40|$|An urban {{rail transit}} (URT) system is {{operated}} according to relatively punctual schedule, {{which is one}} of the most important constraints for a URT passenger’s travel. Thus, it is the key to estimate passengers’ train choices based on which passenger <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> as well as flow distribution on the URT network can be deduced. In this paper we propose a methodology that can estimate individual passenger’s train choices with real timetable and automatic fare collection (AFC) data. First, we formulate the addressed problem using Manski’s paradigm on modelling choice. Then, an integrated framework for estimating individual passenger’s train choices is developed through a data-driven approach. The approach links each passenger trip to the most feasible train itinerary. Initial case study on Shanghai metro shows that the proposed approach works well and can be further used for deducing other important operational indicators like <b>route</b> <b>choices,</b> passenger flows on section, load factor of train, and so forth...|$|R

We reformulate the combined sub models as an Equivalent Minimization Problem (EMP). The Evans algorithm may {{be applied to the}} EMP, in purpose of a realistic application within a reasonable time period.

40|$|Recently {{in-vehicle}} {{route guidance}} and information systems are rapidly developing. Such systems {{are expected to}} reduce congestion in an urban traffic area. This social benefit {{is believed to be}} reached by imposing the <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> on the network users that lead to the system optimum traffic assignment. However, guidance service could be offered by different competitive business companies. Then <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> of different mutually independent groups of users may reject traffic assignment from the system optimum state. In this paper, a game theoretic approach is shown to be very efficient to formalize competitive traffic assignment problem with various groups of users in the form of non-cooperative network game with the Nash equilibrium search. The relationships between the Wardrop’s system optimum associated with the traffic assignment problem and the Nash equilibrium associated with the competitive traffic assignment problem are investigated. Moreover, some related aspects of the Nash equilibrium and the Wardrop’s user equilibrium assignments are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Intelligent {{transport}} systems provide various means to improve traffic congestion in road networks. Evaluation {{of the benefits}} of these improvements requires consideration of commuters' response to reliability and/or uncertainty of travel time under various circumstances. Various disruptions cause recurrent or non-recurrent congestion on road networks, which make road travel times intrinsically fluctuating and unpredictable. Confronted with such uncertain traffic conditions, commuters are known to develop some simple decision-making process to adjust their travel choices. This paper represents the decision-making process involved in departure-time and <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> as risk-taking behavior under uncertainty. An expected travel disutility function associated with commuters' departure-time and <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> is formulated with taking into account the travel delay (due the recurrent congestion), the uncertainty of travel times (due to incident-induced congestion) and the consequent early or late arrival penalty. Commuters are assumed to make decision on the departure-time and <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> {{on the basis of the}} minimal expected travel disutility. Thus the network will achieve a simultaneous route and departure-time user equilibrium, in which no commuter can decrease his or her expected disutility by unilaterally changing the route or departure-time. The equilibrium is further formulated as an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem and is then converted into an unconstrained minimization problem with the use of a gap function suggested recently. Two algorithms based on the Nelder-Mead multidimensional simplex method and the heuristic route/time-swapping approach, are adapted to solve the problem. Finally, numerical example is given to illustrate the application of the proposed model and algorithms. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Every {{individual}} traveler makes <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> in {{an inherently}} uncertain environment, due to random disruptions to the traffic system such as incidents and bad weather, and random behavior of his/her fellow travelers. The premise underlying {{the development of}} Advanced Traveler Information Systems (ATIS) that better-informed travelers make better <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> both at the individual and system levels {{should not be taken}} as granted but rigorously tested. This paper studies two types of information, namely en route real-time information on the occurrence of an incident and ex post information on foregone payoffs (FPs), i. e., travel times on non-chosen routes. Data were collected from an interactive experiment, where human subjects made multiple rounds of <b>route</b> <b>choices</b> in a hypothetical network subject to random capacity reductions, and travel times were determined by performance functions of route flows from the previous round. Preliminary results and bootstrap statistical tests are presented. It is indicated that en route real time information increases the network’s travel time saving and reliability under the specific setting of the experiment, yet FP information has the opposite impact. The most efficient information structure in terms of travel time saving is a combination of real-time information and no FP information. Furthermore, the availability of real-time information at downstream nodes encourages participants’ strategic behavior at the origin. Last but not least, FP information seems to increase risk-seeking behavior, and it encourages route switching without real-time information, but suppresses them with real-time information. These results are potentially valuable for policy evaluations regarding further developments of ATIS...|$|R
