50|$|Starting with <b>Rigged,</b> the <b>band</b> made a {{decision}} to take its music in a slightly different direction. Rigged was recorded by Jim Monroe, who would go on to produce nearly all of Farside's material. The partnership with Monroe led the band to dedicate the final LP's title to Monroe. The production for Rigged was intended to be louder and thicker than previous Farside material and the songs themselves were more aggressive and less pop-inspired.|$|R
5000|$|During the Vietnam War, {{motorcycles}} were rigged {{with explosives}} by the National Liberation Front and abandoned. U.S. soldiers would {{be tempted to}} ride the motorcycle and thus trigger the explosives. In addition, NLF soldiers would <b>rig</b> rubber <b>band</b> grenades {{and place them in}} huts that US soldiers would likely burn. Another popular booby trap was the [...] "Grenade in a Can", a grenade with the safety pin removed in a container and a string attached, sometimes with the grenade's fuse mechanism modified to give a much shorter delay than the four to seven seconds typical with grenade fuses. The NLF soldiers primarily used these on doors and attached them to tripwires on jungle paths.|$|R
40|$|Endurance {{tests with}} ball {{bearings}} made of corrosion resistant bearing steel {{which resulted in}} fatigue lives much lower than were predicted are discussed. Metallurgical analysis revealed an undesirable carbide distribution in the races. It was shown in accelerated fatigue tests in the RC <b>rig</b> that large, <b>banded</b> carbides can reduce rolling element fatigue life {{by a factor of}} approximately four. The early spalling failures on the bearing raceways are attributed to the large carbide size and banded distribution...|$|R
50|$|In 1986, Rodríguez-Seeger started {{performing}} with his grandfather, Pete Seeger. In 1999 {{he was a}} member of the <b>band</b> <b>RIG,</b> with Sarah Lee Guthrie and Johnny Irion. In 2001 he founded the Mammals with Michael Merenda and Ruth Ungar. In 2006 he recorded an album, ¡Que vaya bien!, with Puerto Rican folk singers Roy Brown, and Tito Auger of the Puerto Rican rock band Fiel a la vega and he formed the Anarchist Orchestra (now known as the Tao Rodriguez-Seeger band) with Jacob Silver, also of the Mammals, Laura Cortese and Robin McMillan.|$|R
5000|$|In November 2013 the Vans Warped Tour {{was briefly}} shut down after Watsky made a stage {{jump from the}} 35 ft high <b>rigging</b> during the <b>band's</b> {{performance}} in London. During the stage jump the audience parted. Watsky and also {{two members of the}} audience were injured. Watsky apologized after the event via Facebook. He wrote: 'I have no excuse for my actions, and the only way I can explain my mindset is that it was a huge overreach {{in the heat of the}} moment. No, I was not drunk or on drugs.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Wild Palms {{began work}} on their debut album in 2010, after signing with One Little Indian records on a three-record deal. The [...] "run-down" [...] space in which {{recording}} for Until Spring took place was considered a plus by the band; singer Hill called it [...] "a major influence on the record". The <b>band</b> <b>rigged</b> microphones to Biffa bins {{as well as a}} water tank to create unique sounds while recording the album. There was a deliberate effort to create a different sound for the album than the band was known for from live shows, and {{to get away from the}} post-punk label. The band was also motivated by a desire to create [...] "a continuous piece of work, rather than a collection of songs". They again worked with producer Gareth Jones on the album, which was released 7 March 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Love on an Oil <b>Rig</b> was the <b>band's</b> second {{full-length}} album. Like {{the first}} album, it was recorded {{with the original}} lineup of Taylor, Mason and Daman. It was released on 14 September 2009 on CD and 12" [...] Vinyl on This Is Fake DIY Records in the UK, and Flowershop Recordings in Europe. The first single from it was [...] "Parrot", released on Yellow Vinyl. The album was toured across the UK and Europe with Steph Jones and Dan Lazenby joining the band for live performances after drummer Daman's departure. Touring included a performance in the upper galleries of the National Museum of Wales in November 2009 to open SWN festival, after releasing a song written and recorded for an artwork in the current exhibition there. In the same year they also performed in a forest, on a mountain, in a kitchen and a theatre.|$|R
5000|$|After {{going to}} concerts in his teenage years, Ash made a {{decision}} to be on a stage in some way. He started playing guitar around the age of 15, but confessed to have been very lazy and only learned three chords and nothing more for about three years. He began playing in cover bands, often together with future band mates David J and Kevin Haskins who he had known since nursery school. His first gig was in the Glasgow Rangers Workman's Club.Ash had become friends with Peter Murphy in his teenage years. Ash went to art school and Murphy went to work in a printing factory. They met up five years later and Ash suggested forming a <b>band.</b> <b>Rigging</b> up a makeshift rehearsal space, Ash played an Echo 12 - bar blues, while Murphy sang a series of newspaper articles. Four weeks later, they formed Bauhaus and recorded [...] "Bela Lugosi's Dead".|$|R
5000|$|The {{second half}} of the disc {{continues}} to explore diverse sonic territory with rockers [...] "Dancin' Feet" [...] (performed at the time as a cover song by Van Halen) and the bluesy slide-guitar swagger of [...] "Clown Woman", Jim Alcivar’s keyboard driven cover of Alan Price's [...] "O Lucky Man!", and Ronnie Montrose's acoustic instrumental workout [...] "One and a Half". The closing track [...] "Black Train" [...] is a blistering pre-Speed Metal cover of a Montrose-related song that was never released. In 1971, singer-songwriter Kendell Kardt, formerly of the <b>band</b> <b>Rig,</b> recorded a solo album, Buddy Bolden, featuring guests Jerry Garcia and Ronnie Montrose, both of whom played on the songs [...] "Buddy Bolden" [...] and [...] "Black Train". [...] "Black Train" [...] was written by Kardt about the heroin-overdose death of an unnamed friend of Rig guitarist Arthur Richards. The original Kendell Kardt version of the song has a Country & Western feel with Garcia on pedal steel guitar and Montrose on lead guitar and Hawaiian lap steel. A shakeup at Capitol resulted in Kardt’s contract being dropped and the album being shelved. Ronnie Montrose's motivation for choosing to unearth the unreleased track for a more aggressive reinterpretation may have stemmed from the guitarist's vehement personal anti-drug/anti-alcohol stance at the time, exemplified by his insistence that all Montrose band members abide by a strict policy of drug and alcohol-free performances.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{exhausting}} Jazz Tour in late 1978 for the US and early 1979 through Europe and Japan, most European dates were recorded {{and then later}} spliced together {{to make up the}} Live Killers double-album. This tour featured their [...] "Pizza Oven" [...] lighting rig which consisted of 320 par lights arranged on a massive moveable <b>rig</b> above the <b>band.</b> It was nicknamed the [...] "Pizza Oven" [...] due to the massive amount of heat that the lights generated. When introducing the song [...] "Death on Two Legs", Mercury often swore profusely about the band's previous managers which had to be dubbed over on the album. This tour saw Mercury start to wear full leather/vinyl outfits instead of glam-inspired leotards (which drew a public jibe from Rob Halford of Judas Priest) and, in keeping with a theme of their latest singles [...] "Bicycle Race" [...] and [...] "Fat Bottomed Girls", a group of topless women riding bicycles sometimes appeared on stage. To some observers, {{there seemed to be a}} 'sex theme' deliberately integrated into the shows and this tour first saw the now famous Brian-Brian chant from the audience. Another unexpected feature of many shows was the requests for the seemingly inconspicuous song [...] "Mustapha" [...] by numerous members of the crowd. On this tour, Mercury would sing only the opening few bars a cappella as on the album version, but the band would perform the song in full on the next few tours. On the Japanese shows, the band played [...] "Teo Torriatte" [...] with May playing piano.|$|R
