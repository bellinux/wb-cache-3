5|$|The federal Conservatives {{proposed}} <b>remedial</b> {{legislation to}} override Manitoba, {{but they were}} blocked by the Liberals, led by Wilfrid Laurier, who opposed the <b>remedial</b> legislation because of his belief in provincial rights. Once elected Prime Minister in 1896, Laurier implemented a compromise stating Catholics in Manitoba could have their own religious instruction for 30 minutes {{at the end of}} the day if there were enough students to warrant it, implemented on a school-by-school basis.|$|E
5|$|An {{innovative}} {{drilling and}} blasting technique called Penetrating Cone Fracture (PCF) {{was used in}} the <b>remedial</b> works process. PCF was chosen over conventional drilling and/or blasting techniques due to the reduced risk of damage to the existing structure from vibration, as well as lower noxious fume and dust levels.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{began in}} earnest on 18 April 2013 after {{completion}} of <b>remedial</b> and preparatory works such as land acquisition, removal of vegetation, demolition of certain structures and <b>remedial</b> works on old mines in Midlothian, for which over £54 million was spent by Network Rail. The first task was the excavation of the track alignment through Monktonhall and the clearing of the site for Shawfair station. Construction of the line's first bridge, Rye Haugh Bridge at Millerhall, were underway on 6 August 2013 as part of works to deviate the line out of Edinburgh from Newcraighall before it returns to the original alignment. The 23-arch Newbattle Viaduct (or Lothianbridge Viaduct) was used by lorries removing spoil from the construction site which eased traffic on local roads.|$|E
5|$|In 2003 {{the chapel}} was a finalist in the BBC's first Restoration series, where viewers decided on which listed building, {{that was in}} {{immediate}} need of <b>remedial</b> works, was to win a grant from Heritage Lottery Fund; it failed to win the prize.|$|E
5|$|The {{final section}} to Amlwch was {{surveyed}} by the now Major Rich in January 1867. After <b>remedial</b> work, it opened to passengers throughout on 3 June 1867, although the first freight train to Amlwch was on 10 September 1866, according to Amlwch's first stationmaster, Mr O. Dew.|$|E
5|$|At BYU, {{she worked}} for {{children}} with disabilities as a special education instructor of <b>remedial</b> work. In 1968, Spafford was appointed to the board of trustees of the LDS Church's school system, becoming the first woman on the board. She continued in these efforts until retiring shortly before her death on February 2, 1982.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century has {{resulted}} in a falls that is fairly narrowly channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some <b>remedial</b> work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the memorial's 70th anniversary year, {{a three-month}} <b>remedial</b> project was undertaken, {{restoring}} the bronze and stonework details and reinforcing the foundations. The work was completed {{just days before}} the Remembrance Day services. In 2002 the architects responsible for the restoration, Bruce Harry & Associates, were awarded a Heritage merit award for their work on the memorial by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects.|$|E
5|$|Nowadays, the National Curriculum Guidelines have {{provisions}} for those learning Icelandic whose mother tongue is {{a foreign language}} and deaf and hearing-impaired pupils. Pupils are expected {{to keep up with}} the pace of teaching; however those students who are struggling receive <b>remedial</b> teaching without being moved from most of their classes. An emphasis is made on providing a variety of teaching methods.|$|E
5|$|Rockfalls {{from the}} {{limestone}} cliffs of the Avon Gorge {{have caused a}} hazard to motorists on occasion and every year the road is closed to allow for inspection of the cliffs for potentially dangerous cracks and loose rocks, and to allow <b>remedial</b> works. In 1980, a glass fibre reinforced concrete canopy was constructed over the Portway close to where it passes below the Clifton Suspension Bridge, {{in order to protect}} traffic from such rock falls.|$|E
5|$|As of the 2009–10 school year, {{students}} are required to complete 23Carnegie units of a college-preparatory curriculum to graduate, including 4 units of English, 2 units of foreign language, 3 units of math, 1 unit of world history, 1 unit of US history, 3 units of lab science, 4 units of religion, 1.5 units of physical education, and 5 five units of electives. Spanish, French, German, and Latin are offered as foreign languages. Every summer since 1997, an English teacher has offered a one-week summer course in writing and photography. The school offers neither vocational nor <b>remedial</b> courses.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{proceeded}} quickly, but disaster almost struck {{when the}} aqueduct was first {{filled with water}} {{and one of its}} three arches began to buckle under the weight. <b>Remedial</b> work took several months, but the aqueduct was still opened to traffic only 15 months after the enabling Act of Parliament had been passed, on 17 July 1761. It remained in use for more than 100 years, until the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal necessitated its demolition in 1893, replaced by the Barton Swing Aqueduct.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated {{to such an extent that}} serious <b>remedial</b> work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|Formerly {{known as}} the all-boys St. Procopius College and Academy, the school began to offer a <b>remedial</b> course, or a course {{designed}} to bring underprepared students to competency, to only two students on March 2, 1887. Enrollment grew to 30 high school students by 1947. The academy began to operate independently from the college in 1957. The all-girls Sacred Heart Academy, founded in 1926, operated nearby. Due to dwindling enrollment and funding, St. Procopius Academy and Sacred Heart Academy merged in 1967 to form Benet Academy.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the Department of Energy, {{which had}} succeeded the Atomic Energy Commission, decided {{that since the}} Dayton sites already had been decontaminated, they did not warrant {{inclusion}} in the Army Corps of Engineers' Formerly Utilized Sites <b>Remedial</b> Action Program (FUSRAP). However, the local community in Dayton were concerned that the cleanup did not meet 21st century environmental standards. Therefore, the state of Ohio asked the United States Congress to have the Army Corps of Engineers conduct a review. This {{was carried out in}} 2004 and 2005. The review concluded that no radioactive contaminants were found that would warrant inclusion in FUSRAP.|$|E
5|$|Nikumbh returns, and {{subsequently}} {{brings up the}} topic of dyslexia in class, and offers a list of famous people who were dyslexic. Later, Nikumbh reveals to Ishaan, that he too is a dyslexic and faced problems similar to Ishaan. Nikumbh then visits the school's principal and obtains his permission to become Ishaan's tutor. He attempts to improve Ishaan's reading and writing by using <b>remedial</b> techniques developed by dyslexia specialists; Ishaan soon develops an interest in language and mathematics, and his grades improve.|$|E
5|$|One of Harrison's first acts as {{president}} was {{to implement a}} new training program for college graduates hired by the company. Rather than being placed in supervisory roles, they were given regular entry-level jobs in the engine shops and on the building and repairing of railroad track, {{to give them an}} understanding of the basics of the railroad business. He also instituted a <b>remedial</b> education program for the regular workforce; they were trained in mathematics and other subjects to high school level, as well as in engine and machine-shop basics. The program was designed to help train new supervisors in the skills needed to oversee other workers.|$|E
5|$|The lords of {{the manor}} of Swakeleys resided at Swakeleys House, though {{the house that}} stands today {{was not the first}} on the site. The {{original}} dated to around the 14th century and was probably constructed of wattle and timber. It was subject to extensive <b>remedial</b> work, much lamented at the time, while under the ownership of John Bingley. Bingley later sold the estate to Sir Edmund Wright, a future Lord Mayor of London, in 1629, and the current house was built of brick in 1638.|$|E
5|$|The {{southbound}} carriageway of {{the bridge}} was closed on 1 December 2015 after steelwork defects had been discovered during routine inspections and traffic was restricted 7.5 tonne or less (public service vehicles excepted). On 23 December the Road Bridge reopened for all traffic except heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). On 4 February, it was announced this had been pushed back to March, due to further problems with the truss end link pins in the southern towers, which required additional <b>remedial</b> work.|$|E
5|$|Though the M32 {{has a small}} traffic flow, {{it is one of}} {{the most}} {{congested}} motorways in the region as it connects a number of key areas. As well as providing one of the few high-quality routes into the centre of Bristol, it is the only significant link from the M4 to the A4174 Bristol Ring Road. Parts of the M32 are reaching the end of their intended lifespan, leading to reduced speed limits and occasional closures for <b>remedial</b> work. Local residents have criticised the M32, complaining that it has severed communities and has an unacceptable noise level.|$|E
5|$|With Liverpool, Liddell {{competed in}} the various {{regional}} leagues that the FA assigned the club to and scored 82 goals in 152 matches between 1940 and 1946. He debuted on 1 January 1940 against Crewe Alexandra, scoring after two minutes in a 7–3 win. In his formative years, Liddell credited Matt Busby and Berry Nieuwenhuys as significant influences. He volunteered for the Royal Air Force and, despite wanting to qualify as a pilot, was trained as a navigator because of his proficiency at mathematics. After being mobilised in December 1942, Liddell guested with Chelsea and Cambridge Town. He broke his leg in a friendly kickabout while stationed in Bridgnorth, which required admission to the RAF <b>Remedial</b> Centre at Blackpool.|$|E
5|$|With {{the state}} still {{recovering}} from an economic recession and an election year upcoming, legislators refused to raise taxes. Collins eventually withdrew her request and submitted a continuation budget instead. Some education proposals advocated by Collins were passed, including mandatory kindergarten, <b>remedial</b> programs for elementary school children, mandatory testing and internship for teachers, and the implementation of academic receivership for underperforming schools. Among the other accomplishments of the 1984 legislative session were passage of a tougher drunk driving law, and a measure allowing state banking companies to purchase other banks within the state.|$|E
5|$|Few {{tasks were}} left to {{complete}} when the 1977 construction season began. Most of the pump stations had been turned over to operating personnel by construction workers, and environmental mitigation and cleanup {{was in full swing}} as Alyeska repaired tundra damage caused by construction. Associated-Green, which had performed its construction tasks well, was assigned the job of finishing the final touches on the main pipeline. The last 160 miles of hydrostatic testing were done, 33 <b>remedial</b> welds were completed, and 45 miles of pipe were insulated, among other tasks. Because the pace of construction was much slower than in 1976, fewer workers were needed. Fewer than 11,000 were employed at the peak of 1977 work, about half of 1976's total. On May 31, the final pipeline weld took place.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} family arrive at their new house in Cypress Creek, they meet Homer's new boss, Hank Scorpio, {{who is very}} amiable and seems like the perfect boss. After giving Homer {{a tour of the}} company, Scorpio tells him that his job is to motivate the {{employees}} in the nuclear division. Meanwhile, Bart starts school, but he finds that his new class is far above the standards of Springfield Elementary. When his teacher discovers that Bart cannot read cursive writing, he places him in a <b>remedial</b> class, much to Bart's shock. Lisa goes for a nature walk and discovers that she is allergic to all of the plants around Cypress Creek. Marge tries to go about her daily chores, but the house does everything automatically. This ends up depressing her to the point where Marge starts drinking wine to cope. However, Homer does an excellent job motivating his team in the nuclear division, which makes his family very proud of him.|$|E
5|$|Southern states {{generally}} {{sought to}} disenfranchise racial minorities {{during and after}} Reconstruction. From 1868 to 1888, electoral fraud and violence throughout the South suppressed the African-American vote. From 1888 to 1908, Southern states legalized disenfranchisement by enacting Jim Crow laws; they amended their constitutions and passed legislation to impose various voting restrictions, including literacy tests, poll taxes, property-ownership requirements, moral character tests, requirements that voter registration applicants interpret particular documents, and grandfather clauses that allowed otherwise-ineligible persons to vote if their grandfathers voted (which excluded many African Americans whose grandfathers had been slaves or otherwise ineligible). During this period, the Supreme Court generally upheld efforts to discriminate against racial minorities. In Giles v. Harris (1903), the Court held that irrespective of the Fifteenth Amendment, the judiciary {{did not have the}} <b>remedial</b> power to force states to register racial minorities to vote.|$|E
5|$|The Tameside Archaeology Survey {{began in}} 1990, {{carried out by}} the University of Manchester Archaeology Unit with more than £500,000 of funding from Tameside Council; £300,000 of this was {{directed}} towards the excavations at Buckton Castle. A topographical survey and trial excavations were carried out in 1996 and 1998 to record the castle earthworks and examine the possible outer bailey. As a result, the possible outer bailey was revealed to be a 20th-century feature and was probably related to nearby mining activity. On two occasions (1999 and 2002) illegal digging by unknown parties necessitated <b>remedial</b> work and test pitting. In 2007 full-scale excavations at Buckton Castle began with the aim of establishing the date and history of the site. Across three seasons 2007, 2008, and 2010 trenches were opened across the ditch, the northern entrance, the gap in the circuit of earthworks on the south side, the interior, and the curtain wall.|$|E
5|$|The USAD {{requires}} {{a diversity of}} achievement within each team; teams must have students who fall into three categories determined by GPA. The Honors category is composed of students with GPAs between 3.75 and 4.0. The Scholastic category consists of students with GPAs between 3.0 and 3.74. The final group, the Varsity category, contains students whose GPA ranges from 0.00 to 2.99. USAD uses a modified GPA scale in which performance-based classes such as music, art or physical education are omitted from the GPA calculation. A grade counts for face value {{regardless of whether it}} is from an advanced placement, honors, regular or <b>remedial</b> class. An A is counted as a 4.0, a B as a 3.0, a C as a 2.0, a D as a 1.0, and a F as a 0. Only final grades taken from the previous two complete school years are used to calculate GPA.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built for Sir Edmund Wright, who became Lord Mayor of London in 1640. The brick {{structure}} dates from between 1629 and 1638. In 1629, Wright purchased the grounds from John Bingley, who had undertaken extensive <b>remedial</b> work on an existing 13th century structure in the grounds—probably timber-framed and wattle filled. Bingley's alterations {{were said to have}} been detrimental to the condition of the house and grounds. He was accused of driving away almost all the birds in the dovehouse, and of pulling up many healthy fruit-bearing trees from the orchard. The house had a moat, which Bingley filled in, believing the water to be unhealthy, at which point he also had a defensive brick wall built around the house.|$|E
5|$|The {{road was}} {{constructed}} following World War I {{in order to}} provide improved access to the ports at Avonmouth Docks, which had replaced Bristol Harbour as the major local centre for commercial shipping. Upon opening on 2 July 1926, it was the single most expensive road project in Britain, costing £800,000 (now about £ million). The construction posed a number of significant engineering challenges, including long and deep rock cuttings, a viaduct over the River Trym, and retaining walls against the gorge adjacent to the River Avon. Falling rocks have since been a problem along the Portway, particularly at the southern end close to the Clifton Suspension Bridge, with concrete canopies constructed to prevent loose rock and assist with <b>remedial</b> work.|$|E
5|$|The spit {{is moving}} towards the {{mainland}} at about 1m per year, {{and for the}} last two hundred years maps have been accurate enough for the encroachment of the sea to be quantified. Blakeney Chapel, just west of the reserve, was 400m (440yd) from the sea in 1817, but this had reduced to 195m (215yd) {{by the end of the}} twentieth century. The landward movement of the shingle also means that the channel of the River Glaven becomes blocked increasingly often, leading to flooding of the reserve and Cley village. The Environment Agency considered a number of <b>remedial</b> options to protect these vulnerable areas, and a new route for the river to the south of its original line was completed in 2007 at a cost of about £1.5million.|$|E
5|$|Toothache is {{the most}} common type of {{orofacial}} pain and, when severe, it is considered a dental emergency, since there may be a significant impact on sleep, eating, and other daily activities. It is one of the most common reasons for emergency dental appointments. Correct diagnosis can sometimes be challenging. The treatment of a toothache depends upon the exact cause, and may involve a filling, root canal treatment, extraction, drainage of pus, or other <b>remedial</b> action. The relief of toothache is considered one of the main responsibilities of dentists. In 2013, 223 million cases of tooth pain occurred as a result of dental caries in permanent teeth and 53 million cases occurred in baby teeth. Historically, the demand for treatment of toothache is thought to have led to the emergence of dental surgery as the first specialty of medicine.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from donors, {{instead of being}} placed on static display {{it was decided to}} use the locomotive for charter trains out of York, {{as well as on the}} Scarborugh Spa Express, (York to Scarborough), although problems with its condition soon became apparent. Having failed on the delivery trip to Railfest, arriving on tow, after considerable <b>remedial</b> work it then proceeded to fail numerous times in the following months, with the museum's engineering staff kept constantly busy effecting running repairs, but failed to spot critical faults that would delay the subsequent overhauls and restoration. From September 2004 until May 2005 it was put into the workshops for a heavy intermediate repair, the intention being to improve reliability and allow operation until its heavy general repair (overhaul) and restoration. The intermediate repair failed to improve reliability, and so the decision was taken to go ahead with the overhaul and restoration.|$|E
5|$|Landward {{movement}} of the shingle meant that the channel of the Glaven was becoming blocked increasingly often by 2004. This led to flooding of Cley village and the environmentally important Blakeney freshwater marshes. The Environment Agency considered several <b>remedial</b> options. It concluded that attempting {{to hold back the}} shingle or breaching the spit to create a new outlet for the Glaven would be expensive and probably ineffective, and doing nothing would be environmentally damaging. The Agency decided to create a new route for the river to the south of its original line, and work to realign a 550m (600yd) stretch of river 200m (220yd) further south was completed in 2007 {{at a cost of about}} £1.5million. The Glaven had previously been realigned from an earlier, more northerly, course in 1922. The ruins of Blakeney Chapel are now to the north of the river embankment, and essentially unprotected from coastal erosion, since the advancing shingle will no longer be swept away by the stream. The chapel will be buried by a ridge of shingle as the spit continues to move south, and then lost to the sea, perhaps within 20–30years.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{does not}} meet the National Water Quality Standards due to its high {{concentration}} of Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD). Considering the adverse impact on the lake water quality due to Eutrophication, anthropogenic pressures and holy rituals and tourism, a water quality study was specifically undertaken at four sites on a monthly basis for six months. The sampling sites were chosen to represent the pressure of pilgrims and other pollution inflows at the locations. The water samples were analysed for temperature, pH, salinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, phosphate, sulphate, sodium, ammonium, potassium, total chlorophyll, biochemical oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand. The analysis over the period has revealed that the lake water was alkaline, chloride and conductivity concentrations were high at all the four sites, and there were lower levels of dissolved oxygen (at sites with greater pollution load) and high hardness (on account of excess of calcium and magnesium from surface run-off). During the period of the annual Pushkar Fair, a distinct co-relationship was discerned between various parameters analysed and the degree of water pollution in the lake. This has called for urgent <b>remedial</b> actions to be undertaken by all of the government agencies involved with the lake management, with people's participation.|$|E

25|$|A <b>remedial</b> {{response}} {{is a long-term}} action that stops or substantially reduces a release of a hazardous substance that could affect public health or the environment. The term remediation, or cleanup, is sometimes used interchangeably with the terms <b>remedial</b> action, removal action, response action, remedy, or corrective action.|$|E
