50|$|Broadband over Power Lines (BPL) {{technology}} uses a {{wide range}} of HF frequencies to transmit data (3.5 through 30 MHz), which includes the CB frequencies.

50|$|Very low {{frequency}} or VLF is the <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>RF)</b> {{in the range}} of 3 to 30 kHz. Since there is not much bandwidth in this band of the radio spectrum, only the very simplest signals are used, such as for radio navigation.

Electrons are generated by a cold cathode, a hot cathode, a photocathode, or <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>RF)</b> ion sources.

Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs) are employed to transport the RF data. We focus {{on the impact of}} the nonlinearity of MZMs on the adioover-fibre system performance for single-carrier and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) formatted data.

For instance, two recognized sources of high-pitched sounds might be electromagnetic fields common in modern wiring and various sound signal transmissions. A common and often misdiagnosed condition that mimics tinnitus is <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>RF)</b> hearing, in which subjects have been tested and found to hear high-pitched transmission frequencies that sound similar to tinnitus.|$|E
25|$|Cable {{television}} {{is a system}} of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>RF)</b> signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables.|$|E
25|$|Wireless {{speakers}} {{are very}} similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>RF)</b> waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an active loudspeaker. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.|$|E
40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{intrinsic}} dielectric performance of planar high-density capacitors at <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>RF),</b> the dielectric losses {{need to be}} distinguished from the resistive electrode losses. The resistive losses of the electrodes at RF are de-embedded employing a linear regression procedure with partial compensation for distributed effects. We use tunable ferroelectric capacitors with a barium strontium titanate (BST) dielectric with an inner diameter d ≥ 8 μm on a silicon substrate. The de-embedding of the electrode losses has been successfully performed utilizing 1 -Port RF measurement data from of an Advantest R 3767 CG vector network analyzer (VNA) in the frequency range of 10 MHz – 8 GHz...|$|R

40|$|Printed circuit antennas {{have been}} used for the {{detection}} of electromagnetic radiation at a wide range of frequencies that go from <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>RF)</b> up to optical frequencies. The design of printed antennas at optical frequencies has been done by using design rules derived from the <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> domain which do {{not take into account the}} dispersion of material parameters at optical frequencies. This can make traditional RF antenna design not suitable for optical antenna design. This work presents the results of using a genetic algorithm (GA) for obtaining an optimized geometry (unconventional geometries) that may be used as optical regime antennas to capture electromagnetic waves. The radiation patterns and optical properties of the GA generated geometries were compared with the conventional dipole geometry.

For deuterium and tritium, the optimal reaction rates occur at temperatures {{on the order of}} 100,000,000 K. The plasma is heated to a high temperature by ohmic heating (running a current through the plasma). Additional heating is applied using neutral beam injection (which cross magnetic field lines without a net deflection and will not cause a large electromagnetic disruption) and <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>RF)</b> or microwave heating.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{advances}} have enabled MEMS-based timing devices to offer performance levels similar, and sometimes superior, to quartz devices. MEMS oscillator signal quality {{as measured by}} phase noise is now sufficient for most applications. Phase noise of -150 dBc at 10kHz from 10MHz is now available, a level that is generally only needed for <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (<b>RF)</b> applications. MEMS oscillators are now available with integrated jitter under 1.0 picosecond, measured from 12kHz to 20MHz, a level that is normally required for high speed serial data links, such as SONET and SyncE, and some instrumentation applications.|$|E
50|$|Frequency {{counters}} {{designed for}} <b>radio</b> <b>frequencies</b> (<b>RF)</b> are also common and {{operate on the}} same principles as lower frequency counters. Often, they have more range before they overflow. For very high (microwave) frequencies, many designs use a high-speed prescaler to bring the signal frequency down {{to a point where}} normal digital circuitry can operate. The displays on such instruments take this into account so they still display the correct value. Microwave frequency counters can currently measure frequencies up to almost 56 GHz. Above these frequencies the signal to be measured is combined in a mixer with the signal from a local oscillator, producing a signal at the difference frequency, which is low enough to be measured directly.|$|R

This carrier signal is a very pure and stable sinusoid, typically derived from an atomic frequency standard whose frequency and phase are {{used to measure the}} radial velocity of the probe and from this and other data types derive its trajectory. This same observable can be used to search for space-time distortions cased by low frequency (0. 1 to 100 MHz) gravitation radiation. How such a system works, what its sensitivity limitations are, and what potential future improvements can be made are discussed...|$|R
