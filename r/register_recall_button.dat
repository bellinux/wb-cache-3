Methods. Evaluation of a GDM <b>recall</b> <b>register</b> implemented in 66 obstetrical centers {{in the northern part}} of Belgium from 2009 to 2016. Registrants receive yearly reminders to have a fasting plasma glucose test in primary care to timely detect prediabetes. Results. After 6 years, 7269 women were registered. The yearly response rates varied from 74. 4 % after the first year to 61. 8 % after the fifth year. The number of women who reported a screening test varied from 67. 4 % after the first year to 71. 9 % after the fifth year. Compared to women who responded at least once to a reminder, women who never responded were more often < 30 years (41. 4 % versus 33. 9 %, p< 0. 001) and were more often obese (29. 3 % versus 20. 8 %, p≤ 0. 001).

Results: An initial improvement in overall service levels from 40 % to 49 % was not fully sustained over the 3 -year period. The overall proportion of services delivered varied from 22 % to 64 % between communities and over time. The proportion of participants whose most recent HbA 1 c level was less than 7 % improved from 19 % to 32 %, but there was little change in blood pressure control. Perceived barriers to service delivery included discontinuities in staffing, lack of work-practice support and patients’ acceptance of services. Conclusions: Multifaceted interventions can improve quality of care in this environment, but achieving sustainable, high-quality care in a range of services and local conditions presents particular challenges.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of three different methods of promoting secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in primary care. DESIGN: Pragmatic, unblinded, cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Warwickshire. SUBJECTS: 21 general practices received intervention; outcome measured in 1906 patients aged 55 - 75 years with established coronary heart disease. INTERVENTIONS: Audit of notes with summary feedback to primary health care team (audit group); assistance with setting up a disease <b>register</b> and systematic <b>recall</b> of patients to general practitioner (GP recall group); assistance with setting up a disease <b>register</b> and systematic <b>recall</b> of patients to a nurse led clinic (nurse recall group). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: At 18 months' follow up: adequate assessment (defined) of 3 risk factors (blood pressure, cholesterol, and smoking status); prescribing of hypotensive agents, lipid lowering drugs, and antiplatelet drugs; blood pressure, serum cholesterol level, and plasma cotinine levels. RESULTS: Adequate assessment of all 3 risk factors was much {{more common in the}} nurse and GP recall groups (85 %, 76 %) than the audit group (52 %). The advantage in the nurse recall compared with the audit group was 33 % (95 % confidence interval 19 % to 46 %); in the GP recall group compared with the audit group 23 % (10 % to 36 %), and in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 9 % (- 3 % to 22 %). However, these differences in assessment were not reflected in clinical outcomes. Mean blood pressure (148 / 80, 147 / 81, 148 / 81 mm Hg), total cholesterol (5. 4, 5. 5, 5. 5 mmol/l), and cotinine levels (% probable smokers 17 %, 16 %, 19 %) varied little between the nurse recall, GP recall, and audit groups respectively, as did prescribing of hypotensive and lipid lowering agents. Prescribing of antiplatelet drugs was higher in the nurse recall group (85 %) than the GP recall or audit groups (80 %, 74 %). After adjustment for baseline levels, the advantage in the nurse recall group compared with the audit group was 10 % (3 % to 17 %), in the nurse recall group compared with the GP recall group 8 % (1 % to 15 %) and in the GP recall group compared with the audit group 2 % (- 6 % to 10 %). CONCLUSIONS: Setting up a <b>register</b> and <b>recall</b> system improved patient assessment at 18 months' follow up but was not consistently better than audit alone in improving treatment or risk factor levels. Understanding the reasons for this is the key next step in improving the quality of care of patients with coronary heart disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: To {{study the}} effects of two {{different}} structured shared care interventions, tailored to local needs and resources, in an unselected patient population with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A three-year prospective observational study of two interventions and standard care. The interventions involved extensive (A) or limited (B) task delegation from general practitioners to hospital-liaised nurses specialised in diabetes and included a diabetes <b>register,</b> structured <b>recall,</b> facilitated generalist-specialist communication, audit and feedback, patient-specific reminders, and emphasised patient education. The target population consisted of 2660 patients with type 2 diabetes treated in the primary care setting. Patients who were terminally ill or who had been diagnosed with dementia were excluded from the study. Results: The participation rates were high (90 %) for patients, and none of the 64 GPs discontinued their participation in the study. Longitudinal analyses showed significant improvements in quality indicators for both intervention groups (process parameters and achieved target values on the individual patient level); in standard care, performance remained stable or deteriorated. Both patients and caregivers appeared satisfied with the project. Conclusion: This study shows that structured shared care with task delegation to nurses, targeted at a large unselected general practice population, is feasible and can positively affect the quality of care for patients with type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|John Button’s prognostications on {{the state}} of the Labor Party have already {{attracted}} substantial discussion. Coming little more than six months after Labor lost the federal election — and also lost a good deal of self-respect — he has caught the moment in the political cycle when doubt sets in. "Beyond Belief" claims that Labor is now at the lowest ebb of its hundred years in Australian politics. As an historical claim, this seems dubious. Its present electoral condition, a few seats short of a majority in the Commonwealth parliament, and holding office in every one of the states and territories, is far stronger than in earlier periods in the wilderness, both between the wars and during the 1950 s and 1960 s. John <b>Button</b> <b>recalls</b> Jim Cairns holding the faithful at a cold outdoor meeting in 1955; but that was in the aftermath of the Split that kept Labor in the wilderness for a further seventeen years and that led one commentator to ask whether the ALP was doomed to "Labor in Vain"...|$|R

Organizations similarly promoted causes such as good roads or events such as races. Most buttons were small (7 / 8 -inch diameter) and made from celluloid, an easily molded synthetic discovered in the search for an ivory substitute. Others were old-fashioned metal.

40|$|AIMS: To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} caries risk and glucosy-lated haemoglobin and {{to evaluate the use}} of a computerized caries risk assessment program as a predictor of metabolic control in school-children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: The material con-sisted of 64 young Type 1 diabetes mellitus patients (8 - 16 years) at-tending an outpatient paediatric clinic. Within 2 weeks after the onset of diabetes, a caries risk assessment was carried out {{with the aid of a}} computer-based program (Cariogram) and data on the level of meta-bolic control were collected from the medical records at the 3 -year check-up. Caries increment was <b>registered</b> at <b>recall</b> clinical examina-tions. RESULTS: A statistically significant positive relationship be-tween caries risk and metabolic control was found (r = 0. 51; P < 0. 01), with a sevenfold increased risk of impaired metabolic control after 3 years in those assessed with high caries risk at onset (OR 7. 3; P < 0. 01). When the Cariogram was used as a predictor for the metabolic state of the disease, the sensitivity and specificity was 75 % and 71 %, respectively. The negative predictive value was 91 %.
