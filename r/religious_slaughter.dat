40|$|My thesis aims to {{demonstrate}} how ethical imperialism takes place within Dutch multicultural society, using the recent debate on <b>religious</b> <b>slaughtering</b> as an example. Here we see how different structures of power intersect, specifically that of culture and religion, {{with the issue of}} animal rights. To achieve this I step away from the Kantian approach to ethics and argue for different approaches to ethics, to see what ethics do instead of are. Also, distinctions between race and culture and human and non-human will be taken into account within my analysis. I argue {{that it is impossible to}} understand Dutch history without mentioning its colonial, imperial, and multicultural past. The discourses around multiculturalism in the Netherlands have, however, always been changing. While cultural diversity was once seen as a positive aspect of Dutch identity, nowadays it is the problems between different cultural groups that are emphasized in politics and popular media. Looking at the recent elections of 2012, it can be noted that the topic of un-sedated <b>religious</b> <b>slaughtering</b> was one such issue in which we could see this pattern resurface. Within the debate on animal rights, different ideas of what is "right" and "wrong" or "good" and "bad" emerge. I look at how these ideas feed the notion of migrants as outsiders within the Dutch nation based on constructed hierarchies between cultural practices. To explain the intersection of the issue of animal rights with that of multiculturalism, I use the concept of biopower to explain the roots of the racist and speciesist structures, and work with the thoughts of various posthumanist scholars to rethink difference in order to change the emphasis of the debate on un-sedated <b>religious</b> <b>slaughtering</b> from choosing between either animal wellbeing or religious tolerance, to a starting point of rethinking difference in an affirmative manner...|$|R

"The {{debate on}} Jewish <b>religious</b> <b>slaughter</b> in Norway first {{evolved in the}} animal {{protection}} movement in the late 1890s, but did not become a public matter until the Jews of Norway’s capital Kristiania (now Oslo) were forced by the city authorities to abandon the practice of kosher slaughter (shehitah) within the city borders in 1913. From that moment and until the law prohibiting the practice {{on a national level}} was adopted by the Norwegian parliament on the 12th of June 1929, the debate made the headlines on several occasions in Norwegian newspapers in the interwar years. Hundreds of articles, letters and editorials discussed the case which was known as the «Schächtning-affair».1 The issue received especially much attention from the nationalist right-wing of the Agrarian movement, and the Jewish slaughter practice became subject to a massive campaign from the Agrarian press and from Agrarian party members of parliament. In its final phase during the 1920s, many of the critics were also heavily influenced by the modern anti-Semitic ideology that had evolved in Germany since the late 1870s. One of the most quoted statements from the debate was made by the Agrarian MP, and later prime minister Jens Hunseid (1883-1965) during the conclusive parliamentary session on June 12, 1929: «We have no obligation to deliver our domestic animals to the cruelties of the Jews, we have not invited the Jews to this country, and we have no obligation to provide the Jews animals to their religious orgies»." ...|$|E

Animal welfare concerns are being addressed to improve slaughter practices by providing more training and new regulations. There are differences between conventional and <b>religious</b> <b>slaughter</b> practices, although both have been criticized on grounds of animal welfare. Concerns about <b>religious</b> <b>slaughter</b> focus on the stress caused during the preparation stages before the slaughtering, pain and distress that may be experienced during and after the neck cutting and the worry of a prolonged period of time of lost brain function during the points between death and preparation if a stunning technique such as electronarcosis is not applied.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} animal {{husbandry}} practices {{have been the}} subject of campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s and have led to legislation in some countries. Confinement of livestock in small and unnatural spaces is often done for economic or health reasons. Animals may be kept in the minimum size of cage or pen with little or no space to exercise. Where livestock are used as a source of power, they may be pushed beyond their limits to the point of exhaustion. Increased public awareness and visibility of such abuse meant it was one of the first areas to receive legislation in the 19th century in European countries, but it continues in parts of Asia. Broiler hens may be debeaked, pigs may have deciduous teeth pulled, cattle may be dehorned and branded, dairy cows and sheep may have tails cropped, Merino sheep may undergo mulesing, and many types of male animals may be castrated. Animals may be transported long distances to market and slaughter, often under overcrowded conditions, heat stress, lack of feed and water, and without rest breaks. Such practices have been subject to legislation and protest (see Live Export). Appropriate methods to slaughter livestock were an early target for legislation. Campaigns continue to target halal and kosher <b>religious</b> ritual <b>slaughter.</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the diatribe On sacrifices (De sacrificiis), {{written by}} famous Greek satirist of Roman imperial period, Lucian of Samosata (ca. 120 - ca. 190 A. C.), called Blasphemer or Atheist by Suda Lexicon, and traces its philosophical and literary sources. Lucian criticizes {{all forms of}} traditional Greek religion, in particular animal sacrifices (thysiai). He campaigns against traditional piety, that is, superstition, mentioning two pre-Socratic philosophers: Heraclitus of Ephesus and Democritus of Abdera. The satirical representation of Greek gods in On sacrifices bases on the Iliad of Homer, the desciption of the Eastern cults is anachronic (based on Herodotus), without any references to contemporary religious phenomena. The Lucian’s detailed description of <b>religious</b> animal <b>slaughter</b> (chapters 12 - 13), though it shows a great sensitivity and emotional involvement, is unclear, {{because there is no}} sign to recognize which he means: an usual Greek animal sacrifices or the holocausts. This emotional description is influenced by Homer’s poems and by two important moralizing writings: On piety (De pietate) by Theophrastus (fragments preserved in Porphyrius’ De ahstinentia, II) and On the eating the meat (De esu carnium, 1 —II) by Plutarchus of Chaeronea.

40|$|The {{contribution}} {{examines the}} rules concerning food and dietary religious practices {{issued by the}} UK legislation in several areas such as ritual <b>slaughtering,</b> <b>religious</b> diet in hospitals, prisons, school refectories and so on. In each area, the protection of users and workers’ religious dietary requirements raise {{a number of problems}} related to different competing interests. The measures adopted by the UK law strive to balance these heterogeneous interests and aim at valuing both the religious identity and the dignity of the faithful entitled to follow their religious dietary norms. The method adopted by the UK legislation is based on a constant dialogue between institutions, service providers and local religious leaders. This observation is confirmed both by the relevant normative sources (so-called Secondary Legislation, such as the Prison Service Orders and the Instructions) and by the codes of conduct often including information about the potential users’ religious habits. The cooperation between the political-administrative and the religious dimensions, in the absence of specific agreements between the State and the Churches, works through informal practices capable of influencing the resulting legislation. Therefore, in this context, collaboration with the representatives of religions is an essential element not only for the understanding of religious dietary laws but also for establishing and strengthening trust amongst the “faithful users” and the institutions and service agencies ensuring food supply and refectories management...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} the {{availability}} of halal meat in shops, restaurants and public institutions in the UK has become a reoccurring feature of public debate. Muslims (as well as Jews) are exempt from the legal requirement to stun animals prior to slaughter and it is thus widely assumed that most halal meat in the UK is produced without stunning animals, when the reverse {{is in fact the}} case. There is a distinct lack of transparency in the UK meat industry and public understanding of these issues is not as clear-cut as it could be. Misunderstandings often emerge because halal meat is difficult to identify in the food supply chain. As meat from 'non-stunned' halal slaughter has become visible in recent decades, the commercial sensitivities associated with halal meat from stunned animals have also grown, with supermarkets now often failing to label meat as halal; this adds the confusion, both for Muslim and non-Muslim consumers alike. Not surprisingly, evidence suggests that as well as animal welfare considerations, public concern about {{the availability of}} halal meat and methods of slaughter in the UK is also linked to wider concerns about immigration and integration, as perpetuated through the media. In this paper I explore and compare these issues with developments that emerged around Jewish migration to the UK in the 19 th century, when public controversy emerged around the 'Alien Question'. During this period, Jewish migrants from Russian and Eastern Europe were seen to be responsible for unemployment, housing shortages, and the increasing cost of poverty, very similar concerns to those expressed about Muslim migrants and refugees today. Concerns about <b>religious</b> animal <b>slaughter</b> and animal welfare are consistent across these historical periods and the paper explores {{the extent to which these}} issues act as a proxy for real life problems connected to wider processes of socioeconomic development and change. Based on research on halal and kosher meat markets, and Jewish and Muslim communities (around Europe) over the last two years, I draw on a range of theoretical perspectives to illustrate the underlying complexities of the issues involved...|$|R
5000|$|Raḥmānism (from Old South Arabian rḥmn-n [...] "the Merciful") (Ar: الرحمن) (Musnad: 𐩧𐩢𐩣𐩬) {{refers to}} one or more monotheistic {{religions}} which ousted the polytheistic Old South Arabian religion from the 4th century AD. Since the sole indication of Raḥmānism is the mention of a monotheistic God, it is difficult to establish whether Raḥmānism is an homogenous religion or whether it can be identified with another monotheistic religion.From {{the second half of the}} fourth century the [...] "Merciful" [...] (Old South Arabian rḥmn-n, where the -n is the definite article) and [...] "the Lord of Heaven and Earth" [...] are increasingly invoked. A number of inscriptions as well as archaeological synagogues show that Judaism had played an important role in South Arabia since the 4th Century, but it is not clear whether all the Raḥmānist inscriptions of this time should be construed as Jewish; at the same time it is conceivable that Raḥmānism also involved an autochthonous monotheistic religion in its own right. Distinct references to Christians in South Arabia are found at the beginning of the 6th century when a Christian community in the city of Najrān fell victim to a pogrom initiated by the Jewish king Yūsuf Asʾar Yathʾar. Some consider this event politically motivated while others claim it to be the result of <b>religious</b> zeal. The <b>slaughter</b> is probably that which is alluded to in the Quranic reference to the 'People of the Ditch (Aṣḥābu Ukhdūd), which describes a group of people being thrust into a ditch of fire because of their faith. Apart from being the word for 'ditch' Ukhdūd is also the name of a place just south-west of modern Najrān. As a result of this massacre the Christian Aksumite Kingdom marched into South Arabia and enforced Christianity as the official religion, which was then supplanted by Islam in 632. Christian communities are documented right up till the 13th century in Najrān and till the 16th century in Soqotra. Christian communities are documented; Jewish communities persist until today.|$|R
