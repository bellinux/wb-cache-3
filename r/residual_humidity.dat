We estimated the model parameters by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) of the model, with weights that put more weight on binary recognition of daily {{presence or absence of}} pollen. The model results suggest that alder pollen ripens after a couple of warm days in February, while the whole pollen release period typically takes up to 4 weeks. We tested the model <b>residuals</b> against air <b>humidity,</b> precipitation and wind speed, but adding these meteorological features did not improve the model prediction capacity. Our model was able to predict the onset of pollen season with similar accuracy as models describing only the start of the pollen release period (average prediction error 8. 3, median 5. 0 days), while {{for the end of the}} pollen release period the accuracy of our predictions was not as good. We split the pollen data into odd and even years, and fitted our model separately to each half. Difference in the parameter values suggests a biennial behavior in the onset of pollen ripening, with almost two weeks of difference in the modeled starting date of the pollen development.

In the vacuum chamber during the deposition process, the specific humidity (defined as the ratio of mass of water vapor to unit mass of dry air) is kept constant {{in spite of the}} pressure decrease.

Both catalysts examined, the NaX zeolite, which promotes catenar side-chain chlorination, and the ZF 520 zeolite, which promotes nuclear electrophilic chlorination, are strongly altered in the acidic reaction medium (hydrochloric acid and sulfur dioxide are evolved continually as the reaction proceeds). In the presence of <b>residual</b> <b>humidity,</b> progressive dealumination of the ZF 520 catalyst occurs without destruction of the zeolite framework. It gives rise to the formation of an alum type structure, for which the molecular formula (H 3 O) Al(SO 4) 2. 12 H 2 O has been suggested. Rapid degradation of the NaX zeolite is accompanied by the formation of sodium chloride and of the sodium aluminium sulfate hexahydrate, NaAl(SO 4) 2. 6 H 2 O.

The calibration of data in this initial release is based primarily on numerical modeling of the instruments and on limited comparisons with data taken in flight. As shown below, these data are subject to large offsets, the source of which is not yet fully understood. One possible source is time variation of the gain distribution over the 2 D detector surface; the cause of which is suspected to be contamination from <b>residual</b> <b>humidity</b> absorbed prior to flight [R.

This gain variation changes on timescales of tens of minutes {{in the case of the}} Swarm C satellite, and hours or weeks in the case of Swarm A and B, with Swarm A being the most stable. While such gain variations clearly compromise the accuracy of the EFI measurements, the relative stability of the gain patterns over one orbit provides an opportunity to calibrate the measurements on an orbit-by-orbit basis, based on the assumption of relatively low convection velocity at subauroral latitudes. This approach has been used in preliminary studies of high-latitude flow channels (Goodwin et al. 2015; Archer et al. 2015).|$|E

The study of pH showed a remarkable seasonal variability; it was in the vicinity of neutrality at the beginning of culture (7. 22) to the vicinity of acidity after crop harvest (5. 78), thus the change in pH water was due to the phenomenon of dilution. The electrical conductivity proved that the soil was not saline. The content of soil organic matter was experiencing significant seasonal variation. After applying different doses of phosphate fertilizers, soil phosphorus varied remarkably with the seasons, which can be affected by adsorption, precipitation, heading stage, and the presence of clay cation Fe, Al and Ca. It was also noticed an increase in the content of soil available phosphorus during the tillering stage, which is due to the phenomenon of desorption and dissolution.

An {{analysis of}} the existing methods of granulation was carried out and factors influencing the quality of granular slag were determined, as well as the ways of obtaining granular slag with the required physical and mechanical characteristics. The main factors of granulated slags quality, employed for manufacturing of binding materials are chemical composition and the structure of fine granulated particles. All wet methods of granulation are characterized by high humidity of granulated slag, its value reaching 24, 5 %, due to increase in granules’ porosity. Real options for reducing humidity of granulated slag may include: development of the process of granulation, ensuring manufacturing of products with increased density and low content of fine fractions, dehydration of slag in high bunkers and stacks at sufficient soaking time and slag blowdown with a stream moving downwards. Using mechanical granulators and gaseous energy carriers (air) for melt’s dispersion is an efficient way of reducing water consumption for granulation (semi-dry or dry methods of granulation). It also makes it possible to reduce r consumption of water, supplied for granulation from 3, 0 to 0, 7 - 1, 5 m 3 /min.

A search for new prolonged medical drugs in dosage forms of eye films with Aloe extract with germicide and regenerative properties is prospective nowadays. A choice for additive substances for production of eye films with Aloe extract and working out of an optimal extraction technology was {{the purpose of the}} study. Materials and methods. The work involved: Aloe liquid extract, methylcellulose (MC), polyvin-ylpyrrolidone (PVP), carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), glycerol plasticiser, polyethylene- 400. Humidity of ophthalmic drug films was determined with a gravimetric method; films dimensions: thickness, length and width in mm were measured with calipers; pH of the aqueous solution in films was determined potentiometrically. Results and discussion. A satisfactory appearance (uniformity, goodgap from the substrate, the absence of cracks and ruptures, elasticity and film thickness) was the criterion for selection of film formers at the initial stage. Based on the requirements for ocular dosage forms, the films included sodium tetraborate buffer solution, which provided stability during preparation and use. Based on the study of literature data the selected samples were administered with 10 % of aloe liquid extract. Prepared homogeneous transparent polymer solutions were cast on glass petri dish, pretreated with ethyl alcohol layer with a thickness of 5 mm. Drying of the film mass was done at room temperature to a <b>residual</b> <b>humidity</b> of 5 %. As the result of the studies we have chosen films with film former of methylcellulose. Plates were strong, elastic, homogeneous, without gaps transparencies odorless, 0. 035 mm thick. The obtained films were carved oval shape with a scalpel 4. 0 mm in width and 9 mm diameter. Conclusions. 1. We have designed an optimal structure and technology of ocular medicinal films with Aloe extract. 2. Based on the analysis of the data we have found that the worked out base fulfills all the physical, chemical, and technological parameters. </p...|$|E

Inicialmente foi utilizado um planejamento fatorial completo para os tempos de exposição em microondas de 15, 20, 30 e 40 segundos nas potências alta e média, após o assamento convencional dos biscoitos (2400 C por 4 minutos), visando avaliar o comportamento do gradiente de umidade e umidade global dos mesmos. A partir da análise do modelo ajustado ao primeiro fatorial selecionou-se um segundo plano fatorial com tempos de exposição de 23 e 29 segundos nas potências alta e média de microondas, para proceder às análises tecnológicas do produto. Os biscoitos resultantes destes tratamentos apresentaram redução significativa (p produto padrão, e a textura (dureza) daqueles foi significativamente menor (1207. 59 g) comparada ao padrão (1601. 35 g). O valor de fator de expansão (DIE) para biscoitos padrão (11. 3) foi significativamente maior do que o tratamento com microondas (10. 7), mostrando que á energia de microondas exerce um efeito de encolhimento no produto. Com relação à perda de peso, os resultados evidenciaram que a retirada da umidade {{residual}} pela ação das microondas aumenta a perda de peso do produto (de 0. 910 para 0. 956). No entanto, a diferença de peso não foi suficiente para distinguir as amostras (padrão e microondas) com relação à densidade. Portanto, concluímos que a introdução da energia de microondas no pós-assamento de biscoitos foi capaz de eliminar o problema de fissura do produto através da diminuição do gradiente de umidade dos mesmos, preservando sua qualidade sensorial e alterando muito pouco as propriedades físicas do produto. In this work, {{the effect}} of the introduction of microwave energy in the post-baking of hard semi-sweet biscuits, on humidity gradient, incidence of checking, sensory profile, instrumental measurements of colour and texture, and physical diameter, thickness, expansion ratio, loss of weight, volume and density was studied. A complete factorial plan was used initially at 15, 20, 30 and 40 seconds with high and medium power of microwaves in the post-baking (240 °C/ 4 min) of biscuits, in order to evaluate the humidity gradient and global humidity. Based on this first factorial ajusted model a second plan was selected at 23 and 29 seconds of high and medium microwave power exposure, in order to carry out a complete analysis of the products. The resulting biscuits showed a significant reduction (p< 0. 05) in the humidity gradient and percent of checking, and showed no significant sensory difference with respect to the standard product. The texture analyses showed no difference between the treatments, but all were less hard than the standard: With respect to colour, the products submitted to medium microwave power exposure (23 and 29 sec.) did not differ significantly from the standard, but those exposed to high microwave energy (23 and 29 sec.) did not differ from each other but were different from the standard. The biscuits baked in a conventional oven (electrical heating) at 240 °C/ 4 min and subsequently dried with medium microwave power for 29 sec, showed a significant reduction in the humidity gradient (from 2. 16 % to 0. 88 %) and in the incidence of checking (from 41. 7 %to 0 %). The instrumental measurement of colour (L parameter) of the biscuits (combined, process) was significantly (p< 0. 05) equal to the standard sample and that of texture (hardness) was lower (1207. 59 g) then the standard (1601. 35 g). The expansion ratio of the standard sample. (11. 3) was significantly higher than the combined process sample (10. 7), showing a shrinkage effect due to the microwave energy. With respect to weight losses, the results showed us that the <b>residual</b> <b>humidity</b> removal by the action of microwaves increased the product weight loss (from 0. 912 to 0. 956 g). However, the weight difference was not sufficient to differenciate the samples. It was concluded that the introduction of microwave energy in the pot-baking of the biscuits could solve the checking problem through a decrease in the humidity gradient, without causing any sensory changes or notable alterations in the physical properties of the product...|$|E
40|$|Diante da retomada do crescimento do agronegÃcio do AgropÃlo do Baixo Jaguaribe, a melhoria da malha viÃria da regiÃo tornou-se imprescindÃvel. No entanto, o baixo volume de trÃfego registrado nas rodovias locais, a baixa qualidade dos materiais ocorrentes na regiÃo e os parcos recursos disponÃveis para investimentos em infra-estrutura, inviabilizam economicamente os empreendimentos rodoviÃrios. Tornou-se entÃo necessÃria a busca por soluÃÃes alternativas que reduzam os custos de implementaÃÃo e melhoria de pavimentos. Acredita-se que a adiÃÃo de emulsÃo asfÃltica aos solos ocorrentes na regiÃo, devido Ãs suas propriedades aglutinantes e impermeabilizantes, pode constituir-se em uma dessas alternativas. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a viabilidade tÃcnica da estabilizaÃÃo betuminosa de solos ocorrentes no AgropÃlo do Baixo Jaguaribe, no Estado do CearÃ, para o emprego em camadas de base de rodovias. Para tanto, foram selecionados trÃs solos da regiÃo para o estudo da estabilizaÃÃo com a adiÃÃo da emulsÃo asfÃltica de ruptura lenta (RL- 1 C). As variÃveis investigadas foram o teor de emulsÃo aplicado (2 %, 5 % e 8 %), o tempo de cura seca ao ar livre (sem cura, 7 dias e 28 dias de cura), e a forma de distribuiÃÃo da emulsÃo (distribuiÃÃo uniforme ou em gradiente decrescente com a profundidade). As misturas solo-emulsÃo foram submetidas Ã avaliaÃÃo da resistÃncia mecÃnica (por meio dos ensaios de resistÃncia Ã compressÃo simples, resistÃncia Ã traÃÃo por compressÃo diametral, Ãndice de Suporte CalifÃrnia e mÃdulo de resiliÃncia) e Ã avaliaÃÃo da resistÃncia ao desgaste e Ã abrasÃo (por meio dos ensaios adaptados Loaded Wheel Test â LWT e Wet Track Abrasion Test â WTAT). Foi observado que a estabilizaÃÃo betuminosa promoveu incrementos de resistÃncia das amostras de solos estudadas, sendo essa resistÃncia dependente da umidade {{residual}} dos corpos de prova no momento da realizaÃÃo do ensaio. Os resultados indicaram tambÃm que a adiÃÃo de emulsÃo asfÃltica tem efeitos distintos para os vÃrios tipos de solos, sendo que a quantidade de sÃlica presente nas amostras parece influenciar a qualidade das misturas solo-emulsÃo. Conclui-se, Ã luz dos ensaios realizados, que algumas amostras de solos ocorrentes na RegiÃo do Baixo Jaguaribe podem ser satisfatoriamente estabilizadas com emulsÃo asfÃltica. Taking {{into account}} that the agribusiness of Baixo Jaguaribeâs Agricultural Pole is developing again, {{it is essential to}} improve the road network of the area. However, the low traffic volume observed in the local highways, the low quality of the materials in the area and the limited available resources to invest on infrastructure make the road constructions economically unfeasible. Therefore, it became necessary to search for alternative solutions that reduce the implementation costs and improve pavements. It is considered that the addition of asphalt emulsion to the soils in the area can be one of those alternatives, due to its agglutinative and waterproof properties. The objective of this work was to evaluate the technical viability of the bituminous stabilization of soils occurring in the Agricultural Pole of Baixo Jaguaribe, in the State of CearÃ, to be used in base layers of highways. For that purpose, it was selected three soils on the area {{to the study of the}} stabilization with the addition of a cationic slow setting asphalt emulsion. The variables investigated were the rate of emulsion applied (2 %, 5 % and 8 %), the open air dry curing time (without cure, 7 days and 28 days), and the emulsion distribution (uniform distribution or in decreasing gradient with depth). The soil-emulsion mixtures were evaluated regarding their mechanical resistance (through the compression strength test, diametrical compression test, California Bearing Ratio and the resilience modulus test) and their resistance to wearing and abrasion (through the adapted tests Loaded Wheel Test - LWT and Wet Track Abrasion Test - WTAT). It was observed that the bituminous stabilization produced an increase in the resistance of the soil samples studied, that resistance being dependent on the <b>residual</b> <b>humidity</b> of the test specimens in the moment of test conduction. The results also indicated that the addition of asphalt emulsion has different effects for the several types of soils, so that the amount of silica present in the samples seems to influence the quality of the soil-emulsion mixtures. According to the tests carried out, it was concluded that some samples of soils present in the area of Baixo Jaguaribe can be satisfactorily stabilized with asphalt emulsion...|$|E
