5|$|Three soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Darby Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is prevalent in the northwest part of the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent throughout the watershed except in its lower reaches. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> brown schist and gneiss bedrock. The Urban Land-Wetbrook-Pitts soil association is prevalent {{in the southern part}} of the watershed. It consists of silty, sandy, and deep soil that <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> coastal sediments. Roughly 53% of the land in the Darby Creek watershed is classified as having slightly erodible soil.|$|E

5|$|Two soil {{associations}} {{exist in}} the Ithan Creek watershed. The Neshaminy-Lehigh-Glenlg soil association is present in {{a small part of}} the watershed. It consists of silty, well drained, gravelly, and deep soil that <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> gabbro and granodiorite bedrock. The Chester-Glenlg-Manor soil association is prevalent through the middle of the watershed. It consists of silty, channery, and shallow to deep soil that <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> brown schist and gneiss bedrock. Most of the watershed is considered to have slightly erodible soil.|$|E

5|$|The Dietrich {{hypothesis}} interprets rongorongo {{not as a}} script, but as a notational {{system for}} astronomical, calendrical, and navigational data.

60|$|At {{this date}} the Confederate Army of the Tennessee was {{extended}} {{in a line}} with its right <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the Tennessee and its left <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the Mississippi. Its rear <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the rugged stone hills of the Chickasaba range, while its front <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the marshes and bayous of the Yazoo. Having thus--as far as we understand military matters--both its flanks covered and its rear protected, its position was one which we ourselves consider very comfortable.|$|R

50|$|The towers had {{a central}} pillar, also of {{thoroughly}} dressed stone blocks, which supported the ceiling rafters. Purlines <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> pilasters or cornerstones, and common rafters, in their turn, <b>rested</b> <b>on</b> the purlines. The upper floors consisted of wood sticks <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> the rafters, coated with punned clay. The ground floor was paved with boards or stone slabs.|$|R

5|$|Cibber's poetical {{work was}} derided in his time, {{and has been}} remembered only for being poor. His {{importance}} in British theatre history <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> his {{being one of the}} first {{in a long line of}} actor-managers, on the interest of two of his comedies as documents of evolving early 18th-century taste and ideology, and on the value of his autobiography as a historical source.|$|E

30|$|It is {{seen that}} the {{practical}} range of relative stiffness of chimney is 1  < K CS <  65, whereas that of raft is 0.001  < K RS <  0.5. The upper limit of K CS represents chimney <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> loose sand, whereas the lower limit of K CS represents chimney <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> rock. Hence the lower limit of K CS points out little interaction effect with soil. The lower limit of K RS represents a flexible raft <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> rock and the upper limit of K RS represents a virtually rigid foundation <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> loose sand.|$|R
40|$|Dispersion of Love waves is {{studied in}} a fibre-reinforced layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> monoclinic half-space. The wave {{velocity}} equation has been obtained for a fiber-reinforced layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> monoclinic half space. Shear wave velocity ratio curve for Love waves {{has been shown}} graphically for fibre reinforced material layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> various monoclinic half-spaces. In a similar way, shear wave velocity ratio curve for Love waves has been plotted for an isotropic layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> various monoclinic half-spaces. From these curves, {{it has been observed}} that the curves are of similar type for a fibre reinforced layer <b>resting</b> <b>on</b> monoclinic half-spaces, and the shear wave velocity ratio ranges from 1. 14 to 7. 19, whereas for the case isotropic layer, this range varies from 1. 0 to 2. 19...|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Gartnait son of Áedán could be the same person as Gartnait son of Domelch, king of the Picts, whose death is reported around 601, but this <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the idea of Pictish matriliny, which has been criticised. Even less certainly, {{it has been argued that}} Gartnait's successor in the Pictish king-lists, Nechtan, was his grandson, and thus Áedán's great-grandson.|$|E
5|$|The Mascarene {{martin has}} a heavy flight with slow wingbeats {{interspersed}} with glides, and may repeatedly {{return to a}} favourite perch. This martin is often seen perched on wires, and sometimes <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> sandy beaches. The martin roosts in small flocks in bushes, on buildings or on cliffs. Sometimes it is joined at the roost by other birds, such as blue-cheeked bee-eaters in the Seychelles.|$|E
5|$|The {{ability of}} {{children}} to extract information from their environment <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> understandings of attentional behaviors such as pointing. Episodes of joint attention provide children {{with a great deal}} of information about objects by establishing reference and intention. Joint attention occurs within particular environments. The items and events in that environment provide a context that enables the child to associate meaning with a particular utterance. Joint attention makes relevant aspects of the context salient, helping children comprehend what is taking place.|$|E

5|$|The church {{contains}} a 6th-century inscribed stone found near the village, a medieval font, and some 17th-century decorated wooden panels from Jesus College, Oxford, which was formerly {{connected with the}} church. St Edern's also owns three pieces of 19th-century church silverware, but a silver chalice dated 1574 was lost some time during the 19th century. An 18th-century gallery at the west end <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> two oak crossbeams, {{one of which was}} previously used to support the rood loft.|$|E
5|$|Vertigo {{refers to}} the {{inappropriate}} perception of motion. This is due to dysfunction of the vestibular system. One common type of vertigo is benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, when an otolith is displaced from the ventricles to the semicircular canal. The displaced otolith <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the cupola, causing a sensation of movement when there is none. Ménière's disease, labyrinthitis, strokes, and other infective and congenital diseases may also result {{in the perception of}} vertigo.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{theory to}} Syme's {{has been put}} forward by François Paschoud, who claimed that Maximus was {{probably}} a satirical poet, {{in the same vein}} as Juvenal and not an imperial biographer at all. His argument <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> the point that, outside of the mentions in the History, the only extant referencing of Marius' work is always in the context of Juvenal, and that the History's description of him as a historian cannot be taken at face value, given how it invents or distorts so many other citations. This theory is rejected by historians such as Anthony Birley and David Rohrbacher.|$|E

5|$|After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk {{arrives in}} the engine room and discovers Spock dying of {{radiation}} poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V.

5|$|In some North Indian images, {{the male}} half may be nude and also be ithyphallic (urdhavlinga or urdhavreta: with an erect phallus), {{or with a}} full or half phallus and one testicle. However, such imagery is never found in South Indian images; the loins are usually covered in a garment (sometimes a dhoti) of silk or cotton, or {{the skin of a}} tiger or deer), {{typically}} down to the knee, and held in place by a sarpa-mekhala, serpent girdle or jewellery. The right leg may be somewhat bent or straight and often <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> a lotus pedestal (padma-pitha). The whole right half is described as smeared with ashes and as terrible and red-coloured or gold or coral in appearance; however, these features are rarely depicted.|$|E
5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot <b>rests</b> <b>on</b> a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E
