40|$|The {{negative}} impact of road accidents {{can not be ignored}} in terms of the very sizeable social and economic loss. Road infrastructure has been identified as one of the main causes of the road accidents. They are required to be recorded, located, measured and classified in order to schedule maintenance and identify the possible risk elements of the road. Towards this an accurate knowledge of the <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> increases the reliability and precision of extracting other road features. We have developed an automated algorithm for extracting <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> from Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) data based on the parametric active contour or snake model. The algorithm involves several internal and external energy parameters which need to be analysed in order to find their optimal values. In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of the snake energy parameters involved in our <b>road</b> <b>edge</b> extraction algorithm. Their optimal values enable us to automate the process of extracting edges from MLS data for tested road sections. We present a modified external energy in our algorithm and demonstrate its utility for extracting <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> from low and non-uniform point density datasets. A novel validation approach is presented which provides a qualitative assessment of the extracted <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> based on direct comparisons with reference <b>road</b> <b>edges.</b> This approach provides an alternative to traditional <b>road</b> <b>edge</b> validation methodologies which are based on creating buffer zones around reference <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> and then computing quality measure values for the extracted edges. We tested our <b>road</b> <b>edge</b> extraction algorithm on datasets which were acquired using multiple MLS systems along various complex road sections. The successful extraction of <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> from these datasets validates the robustness of our algorithm for use in complex route corridor environments...|$|R

Here {{we examined the}} role of gaze during high-speed locomotor steering {{and in particular the}} role of feedback from the visible <b>road</b> <b>edges.</b> Participants were required to maintain one of three lateral positions on the road when one or both edges were degraded (either by fading or removing them). Steering became increasingly impaired as <b>road</b> <b>edge</b> information was degraded, with gaze being predominantly directed toward the required road position. When either of the <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> were removed, we observed systematic shifts in steering and gaze direction dependent upon both the required road position and the visible edge. A second experiment required fixation on the road center or beyond the <b>road</b> <b>edges.</b> The results showed that the direction of gaze led to predictable steering biases, which increased as <b>road</b> <b>edge</b> information became degraded. A new steering model demonstrates that the direction of gaze and both <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> influence steering {{in a manner consistent with}} the flexible weighted combination of near road feedback information and prospective gaze information.

40|$|Some {{models for}} the {{suppression}} of turbulence in the L to H transition, suggest that {{the width of the}} H-mode <b>edge</b> <b>barrier</b> is either proportional or is of the order of the thermal or the fast-ion poloidal Larmor radius.

This dependence has been clearly verified at JET in experiments designed to control the edge MHD stability of ELM-free hot-ion H-mode plasmas.

40|$|The Two-level {{model is}} a popular account of how humans use visual {{information}} to successfully control steering within <b>road</b> <b>edges.</b> A guidance component uses information from far regions to preview upcoming steering requirements, and a compensatory component uses information from near regions to stabilise position-in-lane. Researchers who have considered the case of driving often treat <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> as the sole informational input for controlling steering, but this approach is {{not consistent with the}} notion that the human visual system adaptively uses multiple inputs to maintain robust control of steering. A rich source of information which may also be useful for steering control is optic flow. Chapter 2 demonstrates that optic flow speed is used to control steering even with <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> present. Chapters 3 - 5 develop a framework to examine how use of flow speed changes depending on the availability of guidance or compensatory <b>road</b> <b>edge</b> information, and demonstrate that use of flow speed increases only when guidance level information (far <b>road</b> <b>edges)</b> is present. Chapters 6 - 7 go on to examine the contribution of flow direction to controlling steering within <b>road</b> <b>edges,</b> and demonstrate that the use of flow direction appears to be yoked to the presence of compensatory information (near <b>road</b> <b>edges).</b> Together, these experiments demonstrate that the contribution of flow information to controlling steering within <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> can be understood within the context of two-level steering, and show that an approach which emphasise robust control through combining multiple informational inputs is vital if we are to fully understand how the visual-motor system solves the problem of steering along constrained path...|$|R

40|$|Frank's {{prediction}} of the spiral growth mode in 1949 defined a pivotal {{moment in the}} history of crystal growth. In recent decades the topic has received less attention, and instead we have seen a resurrection of two-dimensional nucleation theory in the context of growth experiments on defect-free homoepitaxial thin films. In particular, the key role of interlayer transport controlled by step <b>edge</b> <b>barriers</b> of the Ehrlich-Schwoebel type in shaping the morphology of multilayer films has been increasingly recognized. After a brief review of the classical theory, this paper reports on a recent study of spiral growth in the presence of step <b>edge</b> <b>barriers.</b> Our key observation is that step <b>edge</b> <b>barriers</b> lead to unconventionally shaped spiral hillocks that display the same characteristic ever-steepening height profiles as wedding cakes formed during growth by two-dimensional nucleation.

40|$|Fast {{mapping of}} roads plays an {{important}} role in many geospatial applications, such as infrastructure planning, traffic monitoring, and driver assistance. How to extract various <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> fast and robustly is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a fast and robust algorithm for the automatic <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> extraction from terrestrial mobile LiDAR data. The algorithm is based on a key observation: most <b>roads</b> around <b>edges</b> have difference in elevation and <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> with pavement are seen in two different planes. In our algorithm, we firstly extract a rough plane based on RANSAC algorithm, and then multiple refined planes which only contains pavement are extracted from the rough plane. The <b>road</b> <b>edges</b> are extracted based on these refined planes. In practice, there is a serious problem that the rough and refined planes usually extracted badly due to rough roads and different density of point cloud. To eliminate the influence of rough roads, the technology which is similar with the difference of DSM (digital surface model) and DTM (digital terrain model) is used, and we also propose a method which adjust the point clouds to a similar density to eliminate the influence of different density. Experiments show the validities of the proposed method with multiple datasets (e. g. urban road, highway, and some rural road). We use the same parameters through the experiments and our algorithm can achieve real-time processing speeds...|$|R

Then, six types of gaze trajectories were derived, and models for each type were established. Combining these models with the fact that gaze points are always distributed along the nearby <b>road</b> <b>edge,</b> it was deduced that the starting point of the gaze trajectory when driving on curves has a salient influence on the driver's gaze trajectory...|$|R
