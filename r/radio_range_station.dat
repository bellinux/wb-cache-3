A land route across the roadless 800 mi expanse of Canada, long discussed, now became vital, {{and so on}} 8 March 1942 the American army began construction of the Alcan Highway, a 1671 mi long stretch from Dawson Creek in British Columbia, north-west through Yukon Territory to an existing road on the Canadian/Alaskan border. The highway also allowed the linking up of the Northwest Staging Route, a series of rough Canadian airstrips and <b>radio</b> <b>ranging</b> <b>stations</b> built to convey aircraft from Alberta and the Yukon to Soviet Union and China.

5000|$|Also, {{according}} to Ruppelt, {{when he was}} able to interview the radar and control tower personnel at Washington National Airport, not a single person agreed with the Air Force explanation. Michael Wertheimer, a researcher for the government-funded Condon Report, investigated the case in 1966. He found that the radar witnesses still disputed the Air Force explanation, but that did not stop the report from agreeing with the temperature inversion/mirage explanation. Ruppelt related that on July 27 the control tower at Washington National had called the control tower at Andrews AFB and notified them that their radar had an unknown object just south of the Andrews control tower, directly over the Andrews AFB <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> <b>station.</b> According to Ruppelt, when the Andrews control tower personnel looked they all saw [...] "a huge fiery-orange sphere" [...] hovering over the range station. When Ruppelt interviewed the tower personnel several days later, they insisted that they had been mistaken and had merely seen a bright star. However, when Ruppelt checked an astronomical chart he found that there were no bright stars over the station that night, and that he had [...] "heard from a good source that the tower men had been 'persuaded' a bit" [...] by superior officers to claim that their sighting was merely a star.|$|E
50|$|The airport {{opened in}} 1920, and until 1932, the airport's site was the bypass highway that ran from Tenth Avenue to Eighteenth Avenue. The airport {{served as a}} {{stopover}} for aircraft including US Army Junkers JL-4's and de Havilland Fours going to Alaska. In 1932, the airport {{was moved to the}} intersections of Highway 97 and Highway 16, near Carney Hill (the same site is now the Prince George Golf and Curling Club). At this second, newer airport, US planes also flew in large numbers to Alaska prior to the United States declaring war on Japan. Planes seen included Douglas B-18's and Martin B-10's. This airport was used until about 1942 and was closed for good on March 31, 1944. During the 1930s and early 1940s, it contained Pineview Elementary School, which was renamed the Airport School. On November 14, 1940, the Canadian-American Permanent Joint Board of Defence set out a need for a number of new Northwest airports, including Prince George, for the support of a new Northwest Staging Route. This new staging route would provide protection, permit aircraft to be deployed rapidly to northwestern Canada and Alaska in time of emergency and allow men and supplies to be moved into the region by air. In late 1940, Canada's Department of National Defence contracted to build a new (third) Prince George airport on a bench {{at the top of the}} hill about three miles south-east of the city on the old Cariboo Highway, across from the Federal Government's Experimental Farm. This location is now the site of today's airport, YXS. The Department of Transport built single family homes, an unmarried staff residence, a diesel electric power plant and vehicle maintenance garage. A small administration building and <b>radio</b> <b>range</b> <b>station</b> was built by Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) and a few years later (1944) this was replaced by a new, larger DOT administration/radio range terminal and a large hangar was built (burned down in 2009) about the same time. The resident DOT staff were housed on the airport and the Pan Am staff were accommodated in houses built on the East side of the old Cariboo highway, across from the airport. In 1942, the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) started construction of a number of buildings for their people and for RCAF staff. The buildings included troop dormitories, a medical clinic, a gymnasium and a cafeteria. The latter was also used for USO shows and movies for airport staff. The US staff component included an Army Airways Communication Station, an 11th Air force detachment (1452nd AAF Base Unit - detached from Edmonton Municipal) and a small detachment of US Navy staff. The US Navy had a contract with Pan Am to fly men, equipment and everything else from Seattle to Juneau and Fairbanks via Prince George and on to Kodiak, Dutch Harbour, Adak and back in periods when coastal weather conditions were poor. The 11th Air force 1452nd Base Unit at Prince George airport were Air Transport Command, charged with facilitating aircraft and supply shipments from mainland US to Alaska on the Northwest Staging route.|$|E
