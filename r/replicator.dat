5|$|Visual effects {{producer}} James Tichenor {{claimed that}} visual effects work better when not highlighted, {{and that a}} major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. <b>Replicator</b> models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic <b>Replicator</b> hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship ("green spill", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen.|$|E

40|$|The {{appearance}} of molecular <b>replicators</b> (molecules {{that can be}} copied) was probably a critical step in the origin of life. However, parasitic <b>replicators</b> would take over and would have prevented life from taking off unless the <b>replicators</b> were compartmentalized in reproducing protocells. Paradoxically, control of protocell reproduction would seem to require evolved <b>replicators.</b> We show here that a simpler population structure, based on cycles of transient compartmentalization (TC) and mixing of RNA <b>replicators,</b> is sufficient to prevent takeover by parasitic mutants. TC tends to select for ensembles of <b>replicators</b> that replicate at a similar rate, including a diversity of parasites {{that could serve as}} a source of opportunistic functionality. Thus,TC in natural, abiological compartments could have allowed life to take hold...|$|R

5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a <b>replicator</b> {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for a hypothesis of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E
5|$|How life {{originated}} from inorganic matter remains an unresolved problem in biology. One prominent {{hypothesis is that}} life {{first appeared in the}} form of short self-replicating RNA polymers. On this view, life may have come into existence when RNA chains first experienced the basic conditions, as conceived by Charles Darwin, for natural selection to operate. These conditions are: heritability, variation of type, and competition for limited resources. The fitness of an early RNA <b>replicator</b> would likely have been a function of adaptive capacities that were intrinsic (i.e., determined by the nucleotide sequence) and the availability of resources. The three primary adaptive capacities could logically have been: (1) the capacity to replicate with moderate fidelity (giving rise to both heritability and variation of type), (2) the capacity to avoid decay, and (3) the capacity to acquire and process resources. These capacities would have been determined initially by the folded configurations (including those configurations with ribozyme activity) of the RNA replicators that, in turn, would have been encoded in their individual nucleotide sequences.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c try {{to obtain}} {{intelligence}} {{on the little}} self-replicating robotic invaders in the submarine, but {{they are forced to}} fall back. With Daniel's new theory that the Replicators are made up of the same materials they consume, the Replicators may be eliminated through sinking the iron submarine as long as the surviving <b>Replicator</b> from Thor's advanced ship is destroyed beforehand. Meanwhile, Carter witnesses a short battle against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy during which five Asgard ships are lost. Carter notices the Replicators' attraction to new technology and proposes to use the O'Neill, an incomplete Asgard ship originally designed to fight the Replicators, as a lure to draw the Replicators into hyperspace and destroy them in the O'Neills self-destruct. Thor eventually accepts the plan, the Replicators take the bait and are destroyed.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that life on Earth alters its {{environment}} over evolutionary and geological timescales. An important open question is whether this is a result of evolutionary optimization or a universal feature of life. In the latter case, the origin of life would be coincident with a shift in environmental conditions. Here we present a model for the emergence of life in which <b>replicators</b> are explicitly coupled to their environment through the recycling of a finite supply of resources. The model exhibits a dynamic, first-order phase transition from non-life to "life," where the life phase is distinguished by selection on <b>replicators.</b> We show that environmental coupling {{plays an important role in}} the dynamics of the transition. The transition corresponds to a redistribution of matter in <b>replicators</b> and their environment, driven by selection on <b>replicators,</b> exhibiting an explosive growth in diversity as <b>replicators</b> are selected. The transition is accurately tracked by the mutual information shared between <b>replicators</b> and their environment. In the absence of successfully repartitioning system resources, the transition fails to complete, leading to the possibility of many frustrated trials before life first emerges. Often, the <b>replicators</b> that initiate the transition are not those that are ultimately selected. The results are consistent with the view that life's propensity to shape its environment is indeed a universal feature of <b>replicators,</b> characteristic of the transition from non-life to life. We discuss the implications of these results for understanding life's emergence and evolutionary transitions more broadly...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{the natural}} HMR-E {{silencer}} in modulating replication initiation and silencing by the origin recognition complex (ORC) was examined. When natural HMR-E was the only silencer controlling HMR, the silencer's ORC-binding site (ACS) was dispensable for replication initiation but essential for silencing, indicating that a non-silencer chromosomal <b>replicator(s)</b> existed {{in close proximity to}} the silencer. Further analysis revealed that regions flanking both sides of HMR-E contained <b>replicators.</b> In contrast to replication initiation by the intact silencer, initiation by the non-silencer <b>replicator(s)</b> was abolished in an orc 2 - 1 mutant, indicating that these <b>replicators</b> were extremely sensitive to defects in ORC. Remarkably, the activity of one of the non-silencer <b>replicators</b> correlated with reduced silencing; inactivation of these <b>replicators</b> caused by either the orc 2 - 1 mutation or the deletion of flanking sequences enhanced silencing. These data were consistent with a role for the ORC bound to the HMR-E silencer ACS in suppressing the function of neighboring ORC molecules capable of inhibiting silencing, and indicated that differences in ORC-binding sites within HMR itself had profound effects on ORC function. Moreover, replication initiation by natural HMR-E was inefficient, suggesting that closely spaced <b>replicators</b> within HMR contributed to an inhibition of replication initiation...|$|R

40|$|In {{order for}} the first genomes to evolve, {{independent}} <b>replicators</b> had to act cooperatively, with some reducing their own replication rate to help copy others.

We show that: (1) <b>replicators</b> can be considered to be cooperating as a result of kin selection; (2) limited diffusion on its own does not favour cooperation; (3) the addition of overlapping generations, likely a general trait of molecular <b>replicators,</b> promotes cooperation.

40|$|Initiation of DNA {{replication}} {{is controlled}} by the cis-acting <b>replicators</b> and the trans-acting initiator and initiation proteins that interact with <b>replicators</b> to initiate replication at replication origins. The <b>replicators</b> and origins have been defined as specific DNA sequences in yeasts. However, although over one hundred unique metazoan replicators/origins have been identified, searching for general metazoan <b>replicators</b> is less fruitful. Here, I report a group of general human <b>replicators</b> identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using antibodies against ORC and MCM proteins followed by unbiased cloning of the precipitated DNA. The interactions of the putative <b>replicators</b> with multiple initiation proteins were confirmed by ChIP assays with multiple PCR primer pairs to detect the precipitated DNA and a more stringent re-ChIP assay. The putative <b>replicators</b> are part of LINE 1 (L 1; long interspersed nuclear elements), and are homologous to one another and also to tens of thousand other loci distributed relatively evenly in the human genome, with a density of one in every ~ 100 kb. The DNA sequence, per se, shares some features of replication origins. It was also demonstrated that the replication origins were located near the <b>replicators</b> using nascent strand abundance assays with either alkaline purified or BrdU labeled nascent DNA. In addition, the DNA combing assay confirmed that the in vivo DNA replication was initiated {{in the area of the}} putative <b>replicators.</b> Furthermore, episomal replication assays showed that the replicator/origin-containing plasmids, but not the control plasmids, became Dpn 1 -resisitant after transfection into human cells, indicating duplication of the replicator/origin-containing plasmids. This study identified a group of human <b>replicators</b> and replication origins that are part of L 1, and they may represent the general <b>replicators</b> and replication origins responsible for the duplication of the bulk of the human genome. The hetero-hexameric origin recognition complex (ORC) has been implicated in many cellular activities, including DNA replication, transcriptional control, heterochromatin assembly, centromere and telomere function, and so on. Here, I report a new function for ORC in mediating histone methylation. Using the yeast two-hybrid system I identify a physical interaction between Orc 2 p and Spp 1 p, a member of the Set 1 complex, and I demonstrate the interaction between the endogenous ORC and Spp 1 p by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) from yeast extracts. Furthermore, I find that Orc 2 p physically interacts with trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H 3 K 4) on chromatin by co-IP. Finally, I show that the tri-methylation of H 3 K 4 is decreased in orc 2 - 1 cells and abolished in orc 2 - 1 spp 1 ⊿ double mutants. These data reveal a novel facet of ORC in mediating histone methylation in collaboration with Spp 1 p, and demonstrate a connection between ORC and chromatin structure via the Set 1 complex...|$|R
