40|$|A {{spectral}} reflectance study of selected lunar 'red spots', highland areas {{characterized by an}} absorption in the ultraviolet relative to the visible was conducted. Some <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> were suggested to be the sites of ancient highland volcanism. High-resolution spectral data of eight <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> on the western portion of the moon over the wavelength region 0. 39 - 0. 82 micron were obtained. Much spectral variation among these <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> in the magnitude {{as well as the}} wavelength position of the ultraviolet absorption were found. Spectral structure at visible and near-infrared wavelength were also identified. These spectral differences indicate that <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> do not have a single mineralogical composition, which in turn suggests that <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> may have multiple origins. Additional imaging spectroscopic observations were taken of the Herigonius <b>red</b> <b>spot,</b> a morphologically complex region northeast of Mare Humorum. These data reveal significant spectral differences among the various morphological units within the Herigonius <b>red</b> <b>spot.</b> Although some of these are likely due to the effects of the maturation process, others appear to reflect differences in mineral abundances and composition...|$|R

50|$|In 1950, Tinbergen and Perdeck {{tested the}} effects of visual stimuli on begging {{behavior}} by gull chicks, elucidating which characteristics of their parent's bills the chicks were reacting to. Using models varying in different characteristics, they tested multiple stimuli and found that gull chicks pecked most at a long, red bill with contrasting white bars at the end. Chicks also pecked at other models; in decreasing order of begging intensity were a two-dimensional cardboard cut-out {{of the head of}} a gull with a <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> on its bill, simply a bill with a <b>red</b> <b>spot,</b> and a cut-out of a gull's head with no <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> on the bill. These studies showed the chicks were responding to the <b>red</b> <b>spot</b> stimulus on their parents' bills, an example of imprinting.|$|R

The underside of the wings lacks the white band. The basal area has several <b>red</b> <b>spots.</b> It has a row of <b>red</b> submarginal <b>spots</b> and bluish marginal spots.|$|R

In both sexes the basal <b>red</b> <b>spots</b> on the underside of the hindwing so general in the forms of this genus are usually, if not always, lacking.
