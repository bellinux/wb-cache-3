5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima {{did not have}} a sister named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima and a friend of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E

I’m not afraid to say I’ve been {{attracted}} to a woman before and I’ve kissed girls before and been in love with them before. I’ve never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> girlfriend or anything and I {{would never say}} I’m anything, really. I don’t have an identity in that way.|$|E

25|$|Despite captain Graeme Smith {{becoming}} {{victim of}} Zander de Bruyn's bowling for just two runs, Somerset Sabres still posted a big target, thanks to Matthew Wood, who made 94 off only 35 balls before falling to Nadeem Malik six {{short of a}} century. Wood's smashing helped the Sabres to 210 for 6, although no other batsman passed 30. Graeme Hick tried to emulate Wood, but could only make 87 before Ian Blackwell {{got the better of}} him, and from then on Worcestershire never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance. Blackwell finished with two for 20 in his four overs, and could take his share of the honour for Somerset's surprising win.|$|E
25|$|The school never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{permanent}} location until 1905, when {{a building}} was erected {{at the present}} site of Saint John Paul II High School. In 1930, the building was rebuilt. The building was renovated in 1939, due to the increase of students. Unfortunately, the building was already three stories tall in the 1950s and {{there was very little}} room with which the building could use for expansion. This also was complicated by a lack of room for athletic fields, which included McKeon Field and a football/soccer field. It was decided that a new school should be built using land willed to the town by Enoch Cobb.|$|E
500|$|Sanders met MalcolmX {{again at}} a dinner party. The two had a long {{conversation}} about Sanders's life: her childhood in Detroit, the racial hostility she had encountered in Alabama, and her studies in New York. He spoke to her {{about the condition of}} African Americans and the causes of racism. Sanders began to see things from a different perspective. [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> lot of pent-up anxiety about my experience in the South," [...] Shabazz recalled in a 1990 interview, [...] "and Malcolm reassured me that it was understandable how I felt." ...|$|E

500|$|Tracks for {{the album}} were whittled down from {{recording}} sessions lasting up to 30 hours. Producer Rusko, who played guitar and piano on the album, described the pair getting [...] "carried away" [...] in the studio, appreciating the [...] "mad distorted and hectic" [...] sound {{they were able}} to create. Rusko said [...] "She's got a kid, a little one year old baby, and we recorded his heart beat. We'd just think of crazy ideas". Rusko has described M.I.A. as the best artist he has ever worked with, saying that she had [...] "been the most creative and I <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good time making music with her".|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{undertook}} {{the recording}} of Abbey Road {{with a sense of}} discipline and cooperation that had largely been absent while making the White Album and Let It Be. Having temporarily left the group in January 1969 {{partly as a result of}} McCartney's criticism of his musicianship, Harrison exhibited a greater level of assertiveness regarding his place in the band, particularly while they worked on his compositions [...] "Something" [...] and [...] "Here Comes the Sun". In addition, like Lennon and McCartney, Martin had come to fully appreciate Harrison as a songwriter, later saying: [...] "I first recognised that he <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> great talent when we did 'Here Comes the Sun.' But when he brought in 'Something,' it was something else... It was a tremendous work – and so simple." ...|$|E
500|$|California Chrome raced {{next in the}} September 20 Pennsylvania Derby at Parx Racing. He was the favorite, but {{drew the}} inside number 1 post position. Kentucky Derby rivals Candy Boy and Tapiture also entered. Bayern, who had a poor {{performance}} in the Preakness Stakes but later won the Haskell Invitational, was the second favorite. [...] Parx provided significant financial incentives to any horse entering who previously won a triple crown race or other selected Grade I races, so California Chrome's connections earned $200,000 simply for having him start. Trapped on the rail, first by a speed horse {{in the initial stages}} of the race, and again on the far turn by a challenger who faded in the stretch, California Chrome was unable to gain momentum and finished sixth. Bayern had a clean trip, leading wire to wire, and won by [...] lengths. Espinoza explained, [...] "I never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance to let him run the way he had been running." ...|$|E

500|$|Pickens {{prepared}} for this role by observing several of Kersh's real-life counterparts at the FBI's Los Angeles office, where, according to the actor, the most useful thing he learned was {{that most of the}} people at Kersh's level had been with the Bureau for twenty or twenty-five years and had not reached their positions in the FBI hierarchy by taking their work less than seriously or bucking the system without good reason. Robert Patrick, who portrayed John Doggett, recognized that his own character and Kersh were [...] "both military men – Air Force, Marines". Kersh was depicted as a United States Navy A-6 Intruder weapons officer during the Vietnam War. Both Patrick and director Kim Manners thought that, as Kersh, Pickens would [...] "come in each week and just nail his stuff" [...] regardless of what else was going on. Similarly, Frank Spotnitz thought that [...] "Robert Patrick and James Pickens <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chemistry, loved playing scenes together. And I think their scenes together were some of the finest ones in the last two years of the show." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{winning the}} second race, Kenseth {{drove to the}} victory lane; earning $56,726 for the victory. Kenseth's victory gave his team Roush Fenway Racing its first win in the Gatorade Duels. Kenseth said, [...] "Jimmie Johnson gave me a huge push there and really worked nice for me the whole race. Without that push it never would've got there. Greg lost his {{drafting}} partner. We were able to separate him and the #78 [...] and we had such a big run that Greg {{was kind of a}} sitting duck." [...] Second-place finisher Smith stated while he would have preferred to win the race, he did not have any complaints, [...] "It’s good to know that we have a car capable of running up front." [...] Johnson, who finished third, said, [...] "It was an awesome race. We <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> shot to win that one. It was unfortunate there at the end that there were some lapped cars that were kind of mixed in with the leaders. It would have been nice if they would have let us race there; at least from the white flag on." [...] It took 46 minutes and 23 seconds to complete the second race, and the margin of victory was 0.209 seconds.|$|E
500|$|Mitchell {{revealed}} that Romeo's relationship with Indigo Walker (Samara Weaving) would drift {{apart in the}} event of the [...] "love triangle" [...] storyline. Executive producer Cameron Welsh promised viewers that the storyline would play {{a big part of the}} serial in 2011. He also stated: [...] "Fans will definitely take sides on this one. Luke Mitchell, Rebecca Breeds and Samara Weaving are having a great time with this storyline, and we'll see a new side to all of them as they face the consequences of their actions." [...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> father figure. There's a lot of looking to belong and looking for love because she's had a displaced family life, and she feels like Romeo is her family. Romeo has some issues of his own. He is struggling with his relationship with Indi. The pair find themselves in a similar place of understanding." [...] After Romeo sleeps with Ruby, Mitchell said Romeo immediately regrets it. Ruby then decides to reveals the truth to Indigo. This ruins their friendship and Weaving said: [...] "I think that friendship is pretty much over now!".|$|E

500|$|On {{the back}} of two {{consecutive}} playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled {{with the fact that}} the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions. Duncan, who managed 34 points and a franchise-high 25 rebounds in Game 5, stated his frustration: [...] "I thought we <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance at this series. The Lakers proved to be more than we could handle. Again, we had a (heck) of a run at it. We had opportunities to win games and make it a different series, but that's just the way the ball rolls sometimes." [...] Nevertheless, NBA.com praised Duncan as [...] "phenomenal" [...] and criticized his supporting cast, stating Duncan [...] "made 11-of-23 shots and 12-of-14 free throws, adding four assists and two blocks nd once again, he did not have enough help." [...] Also, Robinson said [...] "Tim [...] was like Superman out there", and conceded that the Lakers were simply better, just like in the last playoffs campaign.|$|E
2500|$|Savant {{retracted}} {{the argument}} in a July 1995 addendum, saying she saw the theorem as [...] "an intellectual challenge'to find a proof with Fermat's tools.

2500|$|A {{legal team}} led by Julian Miles QC, media lawyer Steven Price, and {{barrister}} Felix Geiringer gathered round Nicky Hager, who is seeking a judicial review of the police action. Steven Price said [...] "Our case will be that the police didn't properly consider Nicky Hager's right to protect his confidential sources". Commenting on the case, law professor Ursula Cheer said: [...] "We've never <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> case like this before and we've never really had any of these (public interest) issues tested." ...|$|E

2500|$|After many {{disputes}} with ex-boyfriends {{about the nature}} of love, bell hooks published [...] in 2000. She explains how her past two long-term boyfriends were foiled by [...] "patriarchal thinking" [...] and sexist gender roles, so neither relationship ever <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> chance. She continuously wanted to recommend a book for the men to read, but could not find one that would clearly make her point to support her argument. For this reason, she decided to write her own, which would go into depth about her true feelings towards love.|$|E
2500|$|Nungesser {{complained that}} he had not been allowed to {{introduce}} Facebook messages as evidence. Nungesser and Sulkowicz exchanged several messages {{in the days and weeks}} after the alleged rape. In one message, two days after the alleged rape, Sulkowicz accepted an invitation to a party from Nungesser, writing: [...] "I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz, because we still haven't <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr." [...] Sulkowicz says she sent the messages because she was upset and wanted to talk to Nungesser about the incident.|$|E
2500|$|Nungesser {{presented}} Facebook messages sent August 29, 2012 {{two days}} after the alleged rape where Sulkowicz responded to a party invitation with [...] "lol yussss. Also I feel like we need to have some real time where we can talk about life and thingz [...] because we still haven’t <b>really</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> paul-emma chill sesh since summmmerrrr". Sulkowicz confirmed the authenticity and time stamps of the messages, but included her annotations. Sulkowicz believed that Paul sent the message to avoid suspicion and said her response was so that Nungesser would not be scared to discuss the incident.|$|E
