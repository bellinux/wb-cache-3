Subtypes of antinuclear antibodies include anti-Smith and anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibodies (which {{are linked to}} SLE) and anti-histone antibodies (which are linked to drug-induced lupus). Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. The anti-dsDNA antibody titers also tend to reflect disease activity, although not in all cases. Other ANA that may occur in people with SLE are anti-U1 RNP (which also appears in systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease), SS-A (or anti-Ro) and SS-B (or anti-La; {{both of which are}} more common in Sjögren's syndrome).

2500|$|On 11 July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued a}} {{regulation}} requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements. The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board, even {{for companies that}} petitioned for extensions, on 1 January 2008. However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5grams per serving can be listed as 0grams trans fat on the food label. According to {{a study published in}} the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. In fact, without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> disease, may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel. The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as [...] "trans fat free" [...] or [...] "low trans fat", as they could not determine a [...] "recommended daily value". Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods. However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.|$|E

The purpose of this study was to determine the overall knowledge and health beliefs about heart disease among African American women. Five health belief model constructs of perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, and cues to action were applied as the theoretical framework for the study. Linear multiple regression was used to analyze the association between participants 2 ̆ 7 (a) knowledge of heart disease risk factors, (b) knowledge of heart attack symptoms, (c) perceptions of personal <b>risks</b> <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> disease, and (d) demographic background and their awareness of heart disease.
