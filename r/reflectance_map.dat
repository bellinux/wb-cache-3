We give an iterative algorithm that alternately estimates the surface shape and the light source direction. Use of the unit normal in parameterizing the <b>reflectance</b> <b>map,</b> rather than the gradient or stereographic coordinates, simpliflies the analysis. Our approach also leads to an iterative scheme for computing shape from shading that adjusts the current estimates of the focal normals toward or away {{from the direction of the}} light source.

We find experimentally that the reflectance of graphene on SiC normalized to the reflectivity of bare substrate (the contrast) increases linearly with similar to 1. 7 % per layer for up to 12 layers, in agreement with theory The wavelength dependence of the contrast in the visible is investigated using the concept of ideal fermions and compared with existing experimental data for the optical constants of graphene. We argue also that the observed contrast is insensitive to the doping condition of the sample, {{as well as to the}} type of sample (graphene on C- or Si-face of 4 H or 6 H SiC, hydrogen-intercalated graphene). The possibility to extend the precise layer counting to similar to 50 layers makes reflectivity mapping superior to low-energy electron microscopy (limited to similar to 10 layers) in quantitative evaluation of graphene on the C-face of SiC.

40|$|The rapid {{development}} of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications {{over the past}} years has created the need to quickly and accurately scan the real world to populate immersive, realistic virtual environments for the end user to enjoy. While geometry processing has already gone a long way towards that goal, with self-contained solutions commercially available for on-site acquisition of large scale 3 D models, capturing the appearance of the materials that compose those models remains an open problem in general uncontrolled environments. The appearance of a material is indeed a complex function of its geometry, intrinsic physical properties and furthermore depends on the illumination conditions in which it is observed, thus traditionally limiting the scope of reflectometry to highly controlled lighting conditions in a laboratory setup. With the {{rapid development}} of digital photography, especially on mobile devices, a new trend in the appearance modelling community has emerged, that investigates novel acquisition methods and algorithms to relax the hard constraints imposed by laboratory-like setups, for easy use by digital artists.
