5|$|There {{are various}} {{important}} prehistoric structures, {{many of which}} pre-date the first written references to the islands by Roman and Greek authors. In the historic period the earliest known settlers were Picts {{to the north and}} Gaels in the southern kingdom of Dál Riada prior to the islands becoming part of the Suðreyjar kingdom of the Norse, who ruled for over 400 years until sovereignty was transferred to Scotland by the Treaty of Perth in 1266. Control of the islands was then held by various clan chiefs, principally the MacLeans, MacLeods and MacDonalds. The Highland Clearances of the 19th century had a devastating effect on many communities and it is only in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> population levels have ceased to decline.|$|E

5|$|As no {{description}} of the frieze survives from antiquity and many religious rituals involved secret symbolism and traditions left unspoken, so {{the question of the}} meaning of the sculpture has been a persistent and unresolved one. The first published attempt at interpretation belongs to Cyriac of Ancona in the fifteenth century AD who referred to it as the “victories of Athens in the time of Pericles”. What is now the more accepted view of the piece, however, namely that it depicts the Greater Panathenaic procession from the Leokoreion by the Dipylon gate, to the Acropolis, was mooted by Stuart and Revett in the second volume of their Antiquities of Athens, 1787. Subsequent interpretations have built largely on this theory, even if they disallow that a temple sculpture could represent a contemporary event rather than a mythological or historical one. It has only been in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> an alternative thesis in which the frieze depicts the founding myth of the city of Athens instead of the festival pompe has emerged.|$|E
25|$|After {{the end of}} the Han Dynasty {{the game}} seems to have lost its popularity, and there are no known {{examples}} of Liubo funerary ware or depictions of Liubo playing later than the Jin Dynasty (265–420). Although the game is still occasionally referred to in some historical sources and in poetry as late as the Tang Dynasty (618–907), it seems that Liubo had been largely displaced by the game of Go. By the time of the Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) all knowledge of the game of Liubo had been lost, and it is only with the archeological discoveries of <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> the game has become better known.|$|E

The final featured two finesse players who used their all-court games, a break from <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> featured a succession of power baseliners claiming the title. At almost every point throughout the match, both players approached the net to volley. Tipped as the tournament favorite, Henin won the first set. But Mauresmo recovered to win the next two sets and her second Grand Slam singles title and deny the Belgian a career Grand Slam. This was the only Wimbledon final of the decade that did not involve Venus and/or Serena Williams.|$|E
25|$|Emotions play an {{important}} part in the negotiation process, although it is only in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> their effect is being studied. Emotions have the potential to play either a positive or negative role in negotiation. During negotiations, the decision {{as to whether or not}} to settle rests in part on emotional factors. Negative emotions can cause intense and even irrational behavior, and can cause conflicts to escalate and negotiations to break down, but may be instrumental in attaining concessions. On the other hand, positive emotions often facilitate reaching an agreement and help to maximize joint gains, but can also be instrumental in attaining concessions. Positive and negative discrete emotions can be strategically displayed to influence task and relational outcomes and may play out differently across cultural boundaries.|$|E

500|$|It {{has become}} evident in <b>recent</b> <b>years</b> <b>that</b> {{there is a}} {{disparity}} between what is deemed to be offensive under the Act {{and what would be}} regarded as offensive by a significant proportion of the general public. This {{may be due to the}} age of the law or an indication that the UK has become a diverse and multicultural society. In 1996 there were 562 cases brought, in which 324 individuals were convicted. Even with this small number of trials, a third of convictions resulted in prison sentences, and only a small number of cases went to jury trials. The number of prosecutions has fallen, from 309 in 1994, 131 in 1999, 39 in 2003 to 35 in 2005. This decline may be partly due to the behaviour of modern jurors, who are less likely to consider material as depraving and corrupting, and are reluctant to convict defendants for the private use of material amongst consenting adults. Another reason for the decline may be the range of alternative legislation which can now often be used in place of the Act. Suggestions given by the Crown Prosecution Service include: ...|$|E

Sputnikmusic stated [...] "This is Britney's second greatest hits, and it's incredibly strong. It focuses mainly on her more upbeat, danceable numbers, with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs" [...] and summarized the review adding [...] "As {{one of the most successful}} artists of the decade, is it any wonder this compilation is so good?".|$|E
