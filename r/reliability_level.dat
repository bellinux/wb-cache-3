40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the intra-and inter-rater {{reliability}} of pressure pain threshold (PPT) and manual palpation (MP) of orofacial structures in symptomatic and symptom-free children for temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Fourteen children reporting pain in masticatory muscles or the temporomandibular joint and 16 symptom-free children were randomly assessed on three different occasions: by rater- 1 in the first and third session and by rater- 2 in the second session. The trained raters applied algometry and MP as recommended by the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD. Intraclass correlation coefficients and the Kappa statistic were used to assess the <b>levels</b> of <b>reliability</b> of PPT and MP, respectively. Excellent intra-and inter-rater <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> were observed for PPT values at most of the examined sites for symptom-free children and excellent and moderate <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for children reporting pain. For MP, moderate and poor intra-rater and inter-rater <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> were observed for most sites in both groups. Algometry showed higher <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for both groups of children and is recommended for pain assessment in children in association with MP. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

During the preliminary study phase, the durability design of concrete structures has been performed by a model-based method with a partial factor scheme for chloride-induced corrosion process. On {{the basis of the}} actual design options adopted in the detailed design phase, the durability assessment of concrete structures is performed for the achieved durability and <b>reliability</b> <b>levels.</b> For this purpose, the durability assessment retains the same model for chloride-induced corrosion as in the preliminary design phase, and takes into account the actual design options for concrete elements such as concrete surface coating, epoxy-coated steel bars, and stainless steel bars.

Following the same probabilistic analysis, the maintenance scheme of concrete elements is investigated with specified <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for different maintenance strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a dual active load path fail-safe fatigue design concept analyzed by Monte Carlo simulation. The concept utilizes the inherent fatigue life differences between selected pairs of components for an active dual path system, enhanced by a stress level bias in one component. The design {{is applied to}} a baseline design; a safe life fatigue problem studied in an American Helicopter Society (AHS) round robin. The dual active path design is compared with a two-element standby fail-safe system and the baseline design for life at specified <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> and weight. The sensitivity of life estimates for both the baseline and fail-safe designs was examined by considering normal and Weibull distribution laws and coefficient of variation levels. Results showed that the biased dual path system lifetimes, for both the first element failure and residual life, were much greater than for standby systems. The sensitivity of the residual life-weight relationship was not excessive at <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> up to R = 0. 9999 and the weight penalty was small.

40|$|The {{assessment}} of the structural safety of existing bridges and viaducts becomes increasingly important in many countries due {{to the age of}} the structures and an increase in traffic loads. Many structures need to be reassessed in order to find out whether the safety requirements are met. Most existing standards, however, are developed for the design of new structures. This paper summarises the recent developments with respect to the specification of the target <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for existing structures. It appears from total life cost optimisation that application of the same target <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> for existing structures as for new structures is uneconomical. Further, in some cases the cost optimisation seems to yield rather low <b>reliability</b> <b>levels</b> and human safety criteria become decisive for specification of the target reliabilities of existing structures. In this paper old concrete slab bridges without shear reinforcement are studied. Probabilistic calculations are performed in order to calibrate partial factors satisfying the target reliabilities under traffic load. These partial factors can be used by engineers in level I probabilistic calculations. In this way the often over-costly application of safety standards intended for new structures can be avoided in the re{{assessment of}} existing structures.
