50|$|The {{major step}} in the {{methylation}} cycle is the <b>remethylation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine,</b> a compound which is naturally generated during deamination of the essential amino acid methionine. Despite its natural formation, homocysteine {{has been linked to}} inflammation, depression, specific forms of dementia, and various types of vascular disease. The remethylation process that detoxifies homocysteine and converts it back to methionine can occur via either of two pathways. The major pathway involves the enzyme methionine synthase, which requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor, and also depends indirectly on folate and other B vitamins. The minor pathway involves betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and requires TMG as a cofactor. Betaine is thus involved in the synthesis of many biologically important molecules, and may be even more important in situations where the major pathway for the regeneration of methionine from homocysteine has been compromised by genetic polymorphisms such as mutations in the BHMT gene.|$|E

In this work, we have evaluated several parameters related to oxidative stress and apoptosis in fibroblasts from patients with homocystinuria due to defects in the MTR, MTRR, and MTHFR genes involved in the <b>remethylation</b> pathway <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine.</b> We have also evaluated these processes by knocking down the MTRR gene in cellular models, and complementation by transducing the wild-type gene in cblE mutant fibroblasts. All cell lines showed a significant increase in ROS content and in MnSOD expression level, and also a higher rate of apoptosis with similar levels to the ones in cblC fibroblasts. The amount of the active phosphorylated forms of p 38 and JNK stress-kinases was also increased. ROS content and apoptosis rate increased in control fibroblasts and in a glioblastoma cell line by shRNA-mediated silencing of MTRR gene expression. In contrast, wild-type MTRR gene corrected mutant cell lines showed a decrease in ROS and apoptosis levels.

The mechanisms by which hyper-homocysteinemia may predispose to arterial thrombosis are not entirely clear but consist of endothelial cell damage (5), inhibition of fibrinolysis (6), activation of the coagulation cascade (7), impaired generation of nitric oxide and prostacyclin (8, 9), and enhanced collagen production by smooth muscle cells (10). Major determinants of plasma homo-cysteine levels are folate, vitamin B 12 and B 6 intake, renal function, and to a lesser extent cigarette smoking, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, physical exercise, cof-fee consumption, and alcohol consumption (11). In addition, individuals homozygous for the thermolabile form of MTHFR also show higher levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine,</b> mainly in the presence of low folate (12). One fur-ther dietary determinant of plasma homo-cysteine level may be fat intake because fat intake is associated with higher homocys-teine levels in healthy men, probably because of a lower intake of essential vita-mins (13). High fat intake has been shown to be linked with childhood obesity (14, 15), which is associated with an unfavorable pro-file of risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) such as hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipi-demia, and elevated blood pressure (16, 17).

Rats were fed for 6 weeks the following diets, that is, control, 0. 5 % quercetin, 1. 0 % methionine, and 1. 0 % methionine plus 0. 5 % quercetin diets. Serum homocysteine was significantly increased after methionine treatment and decreased after the addition of quercetin. The mRNA expression of methionine synthase was significantly increased after methionine or methionine plus quercetin supplementation, while its enzymatic activity was significantly increased after methionine plus quercetin supplementation. The mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of cystathionine β-synthase and cystathionine γ-lyase were upregulated after quercetin, methionine, or quercetin plus methionine treatment and a more significant increase was observed for hepatic cystathionine β-synthase in the methionine plus quercetin treated rats, suggesting an interaction between methionine and quercetin.

In the present study we have, therefore, investigated the export mechanism <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine.</b> In HeLa cell lines the release <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> {{was found to be}} a continuous process, which was increased in the presence of copper ions. High cell density led to a lowered release <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine,</b> probably due to a more extensive metabolism <b>of</b> the intracellular <b>homocysteine.</b> It was also found that HeLa cells were able to take up extracellularly released homocysteine and use it in the cellular metabolism. The ratio between intracellular homocysteine and the total amount <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> {{is a measure of the}} ability of the cell to export the intracellularly produced homocysteine.

Objective: to determine the relationship between the polymorphisms Q 192 R and L 55 M from gene PON 1 and the levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine,</b> HDL, apo A- 1 and the enzymatic activity of Paraoxonase I in patients who suffered acute coronary syndrome. Methods: sixteen unrelated patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and sixteen healthy controls were enrolled. The paraoxonase activity, levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine,</b> HDL and apo A- 1 were assessed. The DNA polymorphism analysis was performed using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and digestion with restriction enzymes. Results: levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> are higher in cases (p< 0. 0001) and the genotypes 192 RR and QR are associated with higher levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> (p= 0. 0234). Conclusion: polymorphisms in PON 1 gene could be related to homocysteine levels in Acute Coronary Syndrome patients...|$|R

Excessive amounts <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> in {{the human}} body have been {{considered}} recently as a factor which increases the risk of developing diseases of the cardiovascular system. The nanosystem composed <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> molecules covering a single walled carbon nanotube have been studied by MD technique. The translational and rotational velocity correlation functions have been calculated for several temperatures, including the physiological temperature of 309 K.

40|$|PMC Free: [URL] Remethylation defects {{are rare}} {{inherited}} disorders in which impaired <b>remethylation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> to methionine leads to accumulation of homocysteine and perturbation of numerous methylation reactions. Objective: To summarise clinical and biochemical characteristics of these severe disorders {{and to provide}} guidelines on diagnosis and management. Data sources: Review, evaluation and discussion of the medical literature (Medline, Cochrane databases) {{by a panel of}} experts on these rare diseases following the GRADE approach. Key recommendations: We strongly recommend measuring plasma total homocysteine in any patient presenting with the combination of neurological and/or visual and/or haematological symptoms, subacute spinal cord degeneration, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome or unexplained vascular thrombosis. We strongly recommend to initiate treatment with parenteral hydroxocobalamin without delay in any suspected remethylation disorder; it significantly improves survival and incidence of severe complications. We strongly recommend betaine treatment in individuals with MTHFR deficiency; it improves the outcome and prevents disease when given early. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) catalyzes the {{reduction}} of 5, 10 -methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5 -methyltetrahydrofolate, a substrate for <b>remethylation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> to methionine. Methionine is then converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), the universal methyl donor. In the mouse, MTHFR levels are highest in the testis and mice deficient for a targeted mutation in the Mthfr gene are infertile. Analysis of prenatal gonocyte development provided evidence that the defect in the Mthfr mouse testis occurs shortly after birth. The expression profiles at the mRNA and protein levels suggest that Mthfr is expressed in the male germ line and is developmentally regulated, with a possible role in meiosis. Testicular phenotype was further characterized by altering the expression of this enzyme in an Mthfr folate deficiency animal model. While postnatal folate deficiency appears not to have adverse effects on spermatogenesis, it results in significantly reduced sperm numbers in males from the developmental study, regardless of their Mthfr genotype...|$|E

HCU is usually accompanied by marfanoid skeletal abnormalities, osteoporosis, ectopia lentis and/or severe myopia, cognitive impairment, and a dramatically increased incidence of atherosclerosis and thromboembolic complications of variable presentation. If untreated, HCU {{is a serious}} life-threatening disease. Betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine) is a zwitterionic quaternary ammonium compound that can lower homocysteine, S-adenosylmethionine, S-adenosylhomocysteine, and increase cysteine in HCU by serving as a methyl donor for the <b>remethylation</b> <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> in a reaction catalyzed by betaine–homocysteine S-methyltransferase. This review considers the clinical efficacy and safety of betaine treatment of HCU. Possible strategies by which the efficacy of this treatment might be improved are discussed.

40|$|Abstract Homocysteine is an {{independent}} risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. It is also known {{to be associated with}} a variety of complex disorders. While there are a large number of independent studies implicating homocysteine in isolated pathways, the mechanism <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> induced adverse effects are not clear. Homocysteine-induced modulation of gene expression through alteration of methylation status or by hitherto unknown mechanisms is predicted to lead to several pathological conditions either directly or indirectly. In the present manuscript, using literature mining approach, we have identified the genes that are modulated directly or indirectly by an elevated level <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine.</b> These genes were then placed in appropriate pathways in an attempt to understand the molecular basis <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> induced complex disorders and to provide a resource for selection of genes for polymorphism screening and analysis of mutations as well as epigenetic modifications in relation to hyperhomocysteinemia. We have identified 135 genes in 1137 abstracts that either modulate the levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> or are modulated by elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine.</b> Mapping the genes to their respective pathways revealed that an elevated level <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> leads to the atherosclerosis either by directly affecting lipid metabolism and transport or via oxidative stress and/or Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) stress. Elevated levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine</b> also decreases the bioavailability of nitric oxide and modulates the levels of other metabolites including S-adenosyl methionine and S-adenosyl homocysteine which may result in cardiovascular or neurological disorders. The ER stress emerges as the common pathway that relates to apoptosis, atherosclerosis and neurological disorders and is modulated by levels <b>of</b> <b>homocysteine.</b> The comprehensive network collated has lead to the identification of genes that are modulated by homocysteine indicating that homocysteine exerts its effect not only through modulating the substrate levels for various catalytic processes but also through regulation of expression of genes involved in complex diseases. </p...|$|R
