5|$|At {{the time}} of his death in 1938, it was thought that his wife, Emma Cruft, would {{continue}} to run the dog shows with the help of the show's secretary, Miss Hardingham. After <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> in 1939, Mrs Cruft sold the show to The Kennel Club, however due to World War II, it wasn't until 1948 when they ran the show for the first time. The show would remain being called Cruft's until 1974, when during a rebrand the apostrophe was dropped, resulting in the show being called Crufts, which it continues to be called at the present.|$|E
5|$|Next, Paramount {{sought to}} consult {{franchise}} creator Gene Roddenberry. He {{turned down the}} idea of <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> given the time that production of The Original Series had distracted him from his family. But Paramount {{told him that it}} was impossible to pursue the new series otherwise, Roddenberry began to make plans for the series—with a new cast, as he wanted to avoid retreading and recreating the same roles now seen in the film franchise. Although they had not planned on it originally, Paramount hired Roddenberry to oversee the production and fired Strangis. However, one of his ideas appeared in the premise of The Next Generation, that the Federation and the Klingons had become allies. The first announcement of a new series was made by Roddenberry publicly on October 10, 1986.|$|E
5|$|Following Taboo Tuesday, Evolution (Triple H, Ric Flair and Batista) {{were put}} in charge of Raw, after Eric Bischoff took the night off, {{following}} his match the night before. Triple H granted Flair the match of his choice; Flair wanted a rematch against Randy Orton, as he lost a steel cage match to Orton the previous night. Orton accepted Flair's challenge, with a stipulation that if he defeated Flair he would get an opportunity to face Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at the November pay-per-view Survivor Series. Orton did not receive the opportunity, as he lost to Flair. On the November 1 episode of Raw, Bischoff scheduled a traditional 8-man elimination tag team match involving Team Orton (Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Maven and Chris Benoit) facing off against Team Triple H (Triple H, Batista, Edge and Gene Snitsky) at Survivor Series. The winning team would be granted absolute control of <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> for a month, and the winning members would all get a week {{to be in charge of}} the program. At the November event, Team Orton defeated Team Triple H and the team were given the opportunity to be in charge of Raw for a week.|$|E

25|$|The {{high costs}} of <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> in {{addition}} to a worsening economy in New Zealand, forced Rickard to cancel the show in 1984. The final episode aired on 23 July 1984, and featured Samoan Joe, Larry O'Day, Mel Fortuna, Tony Rickard and Rip Morgan. He and All Star Pro-Wrestling attempted a couple of tours during the next two years but the show's cancellation eventually saw the close of his promotion.|$|E
25|$|The Greatest Show on Earth is a 1952 American drama film {{produced}} {{and directed by}} Cecil B. DeMille, shot in Technicolor, and released by Paramount Pictures. Set in the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the film stars Betty Hutton and Cornel Wilde as trapeze artists competing for the center ring, and Charlton Heston as the circus manager <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> James Stewart also stars in a supporting role as a mysterious clown who never removes his make-up, even between shows, while Dorothy Lamour and Gloria Grahame play supporting roles.|$|E
25|$|Writer Colin Brake {{suggested}} that 1989 {{was a year}} of big change for EastEnders, both behind the cameras {{and in front of}} them. Original production designer, Keith Harris, left the show, and Holland and Smith both decided that {{the time had come to}} move on too; their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of EastEnders most successful characters, Den Watts (Leslie Grantham). Producer Mike Gibbon was given the task of <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and Tony McHale.|$|E

25|$|Kelly {{stayed with}} de Gribaldy for 1977 and 1978. Then in 1978 Michel Pollentier was disqualified from the Tour de France after {{cheating}} a drugs test {{on the afternoon}} that he took the race lead. He left the team {{at the end of}} the season and started his own, with a new backer, Splendor. Both Maertens and Pollentier wanted Kelly. Pollentier and Splendor offered Kelly more and made him a team leader. But Splendor was new and logistic problems became obvious. The bikes were in poor state– enough that Splendor decided not to ride Paris–Roubaix– and the manager, Robert Lauwers, was replaced. Kelly rose above it and rode for himself. The writer Robin Magowan said: Some people can do business on the committee system; others find that life is only fun when you are <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> In Kelly's case it was to mean working for the collection of underpaid has-beens that de Gribaldy habitually assembled. But a smaller, less pretentious team can have its advantages for a rider of Kelly's sort. When you don't have to compete for a team's loyalty you can concentrate on winning races, and that's exactly what Kelly proceeded to do.|$|E
500|$|Pierce {{began writing}} the {{screenplay}} for {{a sequel to}} The Town That Dreaded Sundown, but the film never came to fruition. Around 2008, while developing the horror film The Wild Man of the Navidad, directors Duane Graves and Justin Meeks sought out Pierce, who they cited as {{a major influence on}} their work. Graves and Meeks wanted Pierce to work as a consultant on the film, but he turned them down because, according to Graves, [...] "if he's not <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> he's not interested".|$|E
500|$|Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who {{had written}} for The Simpsons {{since the start of}} the show, took over as showrunners this season. Their first episode as showrunners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of {{pressure}} about <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> They also ran the following season and Jean would return as executive producer in season 13. There were two episodes, [...] "Kamp Krusty" [...] and [...] "A Streetcar Named Marge", that were produced at the same time, but aired during season four as holdover episodes. Two episodes that aired during this season, [...] "Stark Raving Dad" [...] and [...] "When Flanders Failed", were executive produced during the previous season by James L. Brooks, Matt Groening and Sam Simon.|$|E

500|$|Brown {{made some}} changes {{as a result}} of the {{pressure}} from his players and Modell, and allowed Collier to put into place a [...] "check off system" [...] that allowed the quarterback to run several approved alternative plays to the ones Brown called. When Collier was praised in the Cleveland Press for instituting the system successfully, however, Brown put an end to it. [...] "The players believed that Paul was upset when Blanton received some good press," [...] former Browns quarterback Jim Ninowski said in 1997. [...] "Paul just junked Blanton's system, as if to say, 'Hey, I'm <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show</b> now'." [...] As Collier grew apart from Brown, he became closer to Modell, who enjoyed discussing football minutiae with him.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer. It is one of The Simpsons creator Matt Groening's {{favorite}} episodes of the earlier seasons {{because he thought it}} took the show to another level. Meyer said he has a [...] "deep suspicion of social institutions and tradition in general," [...] which affected the way he wrote the episode. Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who had written for The Simpsons {{since the start of the}} show, took over as show runners for the third season. Their first episode as show runners was [...] "Mr. Lisa Goes to Washington" [...] and they felt a lot of pressure about <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> Jean and Reiss were so pressured that they did six to seven rewrites of the script to make it funnier. Jean said [...] "one reason for doing all these rewrites is because I kept thinking 'It's not good enough. It's not good enough'," [...] and Reiss added that [...] "we were definitely scared. We had never run anything before, and they dumped us on this." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{fourth season}} {{also saw a}} change in the {{production}} team. Enterprise had previously been run by the show's creators, Rick Berman and Brannon Braga, who were also the executive producers. Manny Coto joined the production team during the third season as a co-executive producer following his work on the series Odyssey 5. His scripts were well received, having written such episodes as [...] "". For the fourth season, Coto was credited as the show runner. He explained in an interview that [...] "What's been publicized, that Rick and Brannon have stepped back and I've moved in, is not exactly true. I've kinda moved in with them, so to speak, so we're all three <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show.</b> I'm actually more in charge of writing, I guess, dealing with the writers and the 'writing room,' coming up with stories that Rick and Brannon approve or not approve, or give notes on." [...] He explained that the process was for the three of them to pitch stories together and work on fleshing them out.|$|E

According to Chuck D, [...] "We had tight dealings with MCA Records and {{were talking about}} taking three guys that were left over from New Edition {{and coming up with}} an album for them. The three happened to be Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe, later to become Bell Biv DeVoe. Ralph Tresvant had been slated to do a solo album for years, Bobby Brown had left New Edition and experienced some solo success beginning in 1988, and Johnny Gill had just been recruited to come in, but [...] had come off a solo career and could always go back to that. At MCA, Hiram Hicks, who was their manager, and Louil Silas, who was <b>running</b> <b>the</b> <b>show,</b> were like, 'Yo, these kids were left out in the cold. Can y'all come up with something for them?' It was a task that Hank, Keith, Eric, and I took on to try to put some kind of hip-hop-flavored R shit down for them. Subsequently, what happened in the four weeks of December [...] was that the Bomb Squad knocked out a large piece of the production and arrangement on Bell Biv DeVoe's three-million selling album Poison. In January , they knocked out Fear of a Black Planet in four weeks, and PE knocked out Ice Cube's album AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted in four to five weeks in February." [...] They have also produced local talent such as Son of Bazerk, Young Black Teenagers, Kings of Pressure, and True Mathematics—and gave producer Kip Collins his start in the business.|$|E
