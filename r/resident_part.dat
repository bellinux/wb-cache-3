User level code was run using preemptive multitasking, context switches were forced on I/O operations or clock ticks.|$|E

40|$|A graphic {{monitor program}} is described. It was {{developed}} at Carnegie-Mellon University for the CDC G 21 computer, {{which is a}} general purpose, batch-processing system with remote entry. The existing G 21 system and the graphics hardware are described. The graphic monitor is a resident auxiliary monitor which provides comprehensive managerial capability over the graphical system in response to commands from the human user. It also will respond to commands from a user program through a similar interface, where routine calls {{take the place of}} manual actions. Thus the human and program can interact on a symmetrical and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor. The choices made in designing the graphic monitor, given the constraints of the existing hardware and computer system, are discussed.

40|$|In 2000 Congress amended VAWA. 4 Among other provisions, section 1513, {{entitled}} "Protection for Certain Crime Victims Including Victims of Crimes Against Women," {{created the}} U visa. In short, the U visa provides {{what may be}} a critical remedy for non-citizen victims of domestic violence. However, the promise of benefits to immigrant victims of crime has not been fulfilled. The Department of Justice has not issued any regulations pertaining to the U visa. Thus, recipients eligible for the U visa remain in a "legal limbo" without lawful immigration status in the United States. To address this matter, part II discusses the U visa's potential to award legal status to those women who did not previously qualify for VAWA relief because their abuser was not a U. S. citizen or a lawful permanent <b>resident.</b> <b>Part</b> III describes in detail who qualifies for a U visa. Part IV stresses that regulations must be issued soon to encourage immigrants to step forward with information related to crime. Part IV asserts that one possible explanation for the delay in regulations is due to the change of immigration functions from the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the Department of Homeland Security, and describes what relief is available to victims of violent crimes pending the issuance of regulations. Finally, part IV describes the regulations of another visa meant to prosecute smugglers and to protect victims of human trafficking. Known as the T visa, it was created by the same law {{and at the same time}} as the U visa, although T regulations were issued in early 2002. ' A look at the T visa may provide a glimpse at potential U regulation...|$|E
