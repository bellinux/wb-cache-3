25|$|In contrast, {{the regions}} of Lika and Gorski Kotar are the least {{developed}} area {{of the region and}} the country in general. The main source of income in the area was forestry, farming and animal husbandry. Forests represent a development potential of the area as 45% of Lika and as much as 83% of Gorski Kotar is forested. Industrialisation of the region started after the World War II, with a particular emphasis on development of wood processing industry in Gorski Kotar and other industries elsewhere in the region, but it did not create sufficient jobs to prevent economic migrations. Furthermore, the economic structure of the area sustained great downturn in the 1990s during the Croatian War of Independence. Since the 2000s, an increasing prominence is given to tourism sector, especially <b>rural</b> <b>tourism.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The WWF were {{particularly}} important in changing {{the perception of the}} French authorities in support for dam building to environmental protection and sustainable management of its river basin. In 1992, they aided the ‘Loire Nature’ project, which received funds of some $US 9 million under the EU's ‘LIFE’ programme until 1999, embarking upon restoration to the river's ecosystems and wildlife. That year, the Upper Loire Valley Farmers Association was also established through a partnership between SOS Loire Vivante and a farmers’ union to promote sustainable <b>rural</b> <b>tourism.</b> The French government adopted the Natural Loire River Plan (Plan Loire Grandeur Nature) in January 1994, initiating the decommissioning of three dams on the river. The final dam was decommissioned by Électricité de France at a cost of 7million francs in 1998. The basis of the decision was that the economic benefits of the dams did not outweigh their significant ecological impacts, so the intention was to restore the riverine ecosystems and replenish great Loire salmon stocks. The Loire is unique in this respect as the Atlantic salmon can swim as far as [...] up the river and spawn in {{the upper reaches of the}} Allier. The French government undertook this major plan, chiefly because pollution and overfishing had reduced approximately 100,000 salmon migrating annually to their spawning grounds in the headwaters of the Loire and its tributaries to just 67 salmon in 1996 on the upper Allier.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rural</b> {{community-based}} <b>tourism</b> (turismo <b>rural</b> y comunitario) is smallscale <b>tourism</b> in poor <b>rural</b> areas, {{where the}} local people are active actors in tourism development. It is often perceived as a sustainable and responsible form of tourism. However, in practice the planning and evaluation of the tourism development is often concentrated only upon rapid economic and environmental impacts and the sociocultural signifi cance is left without proper attention. The issues about sociocultural development have not been considered seriously enough in alternative tourism contexts. This study aims to fi ll this gap by bringing together cultural studies of tourism and studies of development. The starting point {{of this study is}} that ustainable tourism development cannot take place without social justice and active local participation. The purpose of this research is to analyze the sociocultural possibilities and challenges of <b>rural</b> community-based <b>tourism</b> development in the host communities. This research has an ethnographic approach and it includes a field study in three communities of Fair Trade Coffee Trail in San Ramón, Northern Nicaragua. The idea for the tourism development was born after the coffee price crisis in 2001, given that the main objectives of tourism were to bring complementary income to the poor coffee farmers and to promote equal participation inside the communities. Data for the sociocultural impact analysis was collected through 23 semi-structured interviews and participatory observation during four week period of fi eldwork in 2008. The results of this study support the assumption that the real essence of <b>rural</b> community-based <b>tourism</b> is its potential to promote people’s control over factors that affect their lives – in other words to support empowerment. In San Ramón tourism development had especially brought new opportunities to the young people working as guides and to the women responsible for the tourism accommodation. Women and young guides had been able to enhance their self-esteem and freedom of choice through new contacts, knowledge, new skills and cultural pride. The encounters with visitors had been mainly positive. Alternatively, the weakness in the local broker’s coordination had threatened the whole tourism development. The sociocultural benefi ts of tourism had not reached the community level and therefore had not promoted the social empowerment of communities. The results of this study can encourage and help development agencies to support community-based tourism initiatives as a tool of sustainable development. Developing a holistic guideline for <b>rural</b> community-based <b>tourism</b> development presents a challenge for further studies...|$|R
