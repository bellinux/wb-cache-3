40|$|HVDC {{has been}} used mainly for {{point-to-point}} transmission with one sending and one <b>receiving</b> <b>converter</b> station. Although the connection {{of more than two}} HVDC into a multi-terminal HVDC configuration is feasible, {{there are only a few}} such schemes in service. The need for integration of large scale renewable generation, the electrification of oil- and gas-platforms from on shore grids, the integration of markets, has resulted in a demand for new transmission capacity and interconnectors. To meet this need consideration is being given to applications of more multi-terminal or meshed HVDC grids. The evolving Voltage Sourced HVDC (VSC HVDC) technology has made it easier to build such HVDC schemes. In 2009 SC B 4 initiated WG B 4 - 52 “HVDC Grid Feasibility Study”, to investigate the feasibility of this concept. The WG has identified a number of issues that need to be studied in more details. Therefore, SC B 4 is now proposing five additional WGs as follows: B 4 - 56 : Guidelines for the preparation of “connection agreements ” or “Grid Codes ” for HVDC Grids- This ToR B 4 - 57 : Guide for the development of models for HVDC converters in a HVDC grid.

40|$|In organisations {{decision}} makers act as information <b>converters,</b> <b>receiving</b> and translating information flows into managerial actions. A system dynamics approach identifies how streams of decisions and resources interact to produce behaviours recognised as problematic for an organisation, {{for the purpose}} of intervention and performance improvement. It takes a view that most persistent organisational problems are of our own making, and that while external events can impact severely, the long-term quality of organisational responses is ultimately a consequence of internal decision making, and of the structure within which actions are framed and implemented. So the articulation of structure becomes the focus and has three significant components: (1) the relationship between elements that interact in actual decision-making processes; (2) the identification of circular chains of causality (cycles) formed from such links; (3) the estimation of time delays that act to induce lags in action-impact links and hence in the cycles. The modelling of decision-making structure in terms of nonlinear mathematical relationships is followed by simulation, which aims to reproduce the problem behaviour(s) of concern, {{or in the case of}} a new organisation to generate output that reflects what can be expected from the intended actions. There is then a basis for policy analysis and re-design to achieve improved performance. The article will discuss and illustrate systems models built to generate behaviours (typically cyclical) that a typical university exhibits over time with respect to matters such as faculty staffing, budgetary conditions, and the impact of supposed incentives to stimulate change and exercise leverage.

40|$|Because Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) {{often have}} a high packet loss rate, the {{formerly}} used protocol for video streaming, Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), is no longer suitable for this specific environment. Previous conducted research has offered many new protocols to solve this problem; however, most of them cannot make full use of the existing Internet video streaming resources like RTP servers. Our work proposes two models to solve this compatibility issue. The first model is called the converter model. Based on this model, we first modify RTP using Erasure Coding (EC) technique in order to adapt it to the high packet loss rate of VANETs. This newly developed protocol is called EC-RTP. And, we then developed two converters. The first converter stands on {{the boundary between the}} Internet and VANETs. It receives the RTP packets which sent from Internet. And then it translates them to the EC-RTP packets. These packets are transported over the VANETs. The second <b>converter</b> <b>receives</b> these EC-RTP packets, translates them back to the RTP packets. It then sends them to the RTP player, so that the RTP player can play these packets. To make EC-RTP can carry more kinds of video streams other than RTP, we proposed a second model. The second model is called the redundancy tunnel. Based on this model, we let the protocol between the two converters carry RTP protocol as its payload. We use the same technique as we have used to modify RTP. At last, we did some experiments with Android tablets. The experiment results show our solution can use the same player to play the same video resources as RTP does. However, unlike RTP, it can reduce packet loss rate...|$|R
