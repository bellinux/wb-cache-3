50|$|The Railways Act 2005 {{abolished}} the SRA and transferred {{the responsibility for}} franchises in England and Wales directly to the government through the Secretary of State for Transport, with the Welsh Government being given a direct role over services in Wales. Responsibility for the ScotRail franchise was passed to the Scottish Government. The 2005 Act also gave local and devolved administrations the ability to alter fares up or down, provided they funded the extra cost, or used the savings on other transport modes. The In a move designed to make them accountable for their decisions in this new role, English PTEs were removed from being direct parties to franchise agreements, instead gaining a role in long term planning and a statutory <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>consultation</b> over franchises in their areas. In London, the Act required the DfT to consult Transport for London on any franchise with services to, from or within London. In July 2007, these powers were extended, with measures designed to protect those outside London, with the DfT as the arbiter of disputes.|$|E
50|$|UNAP (Unión Nativa Ayoreo del Paraguay) lists six {{threats to}} Ayoreo living in {{voluntary}} isolation: cattle farming and deforestation, sale and allocation of Ayoreo territory, searches for oil, missionaries seeking contact, illegal collection of territory resources, and violation of territory by various groups. Cattle farming {{and the subsequent}} deforestation is often illegal, destroys territory and resources such as water, and increases the chance of unwanted contact. Various laws give the Ayoreo the right to ownership over the land they live on, which prohibits people from entering or selling the land, yet about eight million hectares is still redistributed. Owners often claim no one lives on their land despite evidence proving otherwise. Oil testing on Ayoreo disturbs the people there, risks contact, and violates the Ayoreo’s <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>consultation</b> and land ownership. By trying to evangelize the Ayoreo, missionaries risk spreading diseases and violate laws protecting indigenous peoples from contact. The collection of resources takes necessities from {{the people living in}} the territory and risks contact. The violation of territories occurs when groups enter Ayoreo land without permission, creating a great risk of contact, and can displace the people living there.|$|E

This {{is a very}} important issue because tax administrations increasingly rely on mutual assistance in tax matters.

40|$|One way of {{improving}} natural resource regimes would be through a more careful and consistent identification of rights-holders, with more explicit attention {{for the relationship}} between the rights of indigenous peoples and other local nonindigenous communities. This argument is illustrated with a critical analysis of the protected areas legislation in Peru, focusing on the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>consultation</b> prior to the establishment of a protected area, and the rights to use and sustainably manage natural resources within protected areas. On the basis of both international human rights law and empirical data, it is suggested that limiting subsistence-related rights in protected areas to indigenous peoples could endanger the enjoyment of the right to food of the local non-indigenous population. Moreover, the extension of certain human rights that are currently only or mostly granted to indigenous peoples to the broader local population affected by a protected area, should be considered...|$|E

In analysing the jurisprudence of the Inter-American Court, special attention is paid to the interpretative methods applied by the regional tribunal, and to the manner in which a non-restrictive and ‘culturally friendly’ interpretation of conventionally protected human rights has contributed to the enlargement of their scope of protection, and to their enjoyment by one of the most marginalized and excluded sectors of Latin-American societies...|$|E

This article, which provides the first comprehensive analysis of this right, highlights the current inconsistencies in interpretation and application of the consultation duty. It then attempts to provide suggestions for changes that can be implemented by the legislative, executive or judicial branches. In Part I, we provide a brief overview of the development of the trust responsibility and explain how it came to include three substantive duties: to provide services to tribal members, to protect tribal sovereignty, and to protect tribal resources. In Part II, we offer the first detailed explanation of how the trust responsibility developed the procedural duty to consult with Indian tribes. In this section we also discuss recent attempts by the Obama Administration to reform the federal government’s consultation duty. In Part III, we analyze the consultation policies that have been developed by federal agencies. In doing so, we identify four flaws that have prevented these policies from being truly effective: lack of enforceability, specificity, uniformity, and substantive constraints. Finally, in Part IV we present our proposal for reforming the consultation duty through legislation, and offer suggestions that can be implemented by the judicial and executive branches in the interim...|$|E
40|$|A partir de bases doctrinarias y normativas se analizan los avances y retrocesos de la jurisprudencia chilena en relación al reconocimiento de la costumbreindígena, la justiciabilidad del derecho propio indígena y la aplicación de un enfoque de pluralismo jurídico. Existen algunos avances en la jurisprudencia –a partir de la vigencia del Convenio 169 de la OIT– en el reconocimiento del derecho de propiedad ancestral al agua; derechos de uso, aprovechamiento y protección de tierras, recursos naturales y ecosistemas que conforman el hábitat {{territorial}} indígena; y derecho a la consulta acorde a la especificidad étnica de los pueblos indígenas. Sin embargo, en general, la jurisprudencia chilena salvaguarda la hegemonía del derecho estatal y los principios que lo estructuran, tanto {{en materia}} penal, donde excepcionalmente se aplica la costumbre como eximente o atenuante de responsabilidad penal, como en materia civil, donde se recogen tímidamente las normas y principios contenidos en la Ley Indígena y el Convenio 169 respecto del derecho de propiedad y posesión de las tierras de los pueblos indígenas. Por último, son inexistentes los casos de reconocimiento cierto de la potestad jurisdiccional de las autoridades indígenas para resolver los conflictos propios de su comunidad. Based on doctrinal and legal considerations, this paper analyses the progress and setbacks of Chilean jurisprudence {{with regard to}} the recognition of indigenous customs, the justiciability of indigenous law and the implementation of a pluralistic legal approach. Since the entry into force of the 169 ILO Convention, there have been some developments in the jurisprudence pertaining to the legal recognition of the ancestral property right to water; rights of use, exploitation and protection of the land; natural resources and ecosystems that make up indigenous habitats; and the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>consultation</b> taking into account the ethnic specificity of indigenous peoples. However, Chilean jurisprudence tends to protect the hegemony of State law and its structuring principles, both in criminal matters, where customary law can be applied exceptionally as a ground for excluding or mitigating criminal responsibility, and in civil matters, where the rules and principles established in the Indigenous Act and in the 169 Convention have been reluctantly adopted with regard to indigenous people’s right to property and possession of the land.

40|$|Works councils, {{found in}} most Western European economies, are elected bodies of {{employees}} with <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> information, <b>consultation,</b> {{and in some cases}} co-determination of employment conditions at local workplaces, mandated by law. Many European employers and unions believe that councils improve communication between workers and management, raising social output, while reducing the speed with which decisions are made. This paper analyzes the operation of councils as a means of improving social output by creating more cooperative labor relations. It argues that councils are mandated because the incentive for companies to institute them and delegate them power falls short of the social incentive; that workers provide more accurate information to employers about preferences when councils have some say over how that information is used; and that the communication from employers to workers produces socially desirable worker concessions in bad times that would not occur absent this institution. It compares a jury style random selection of works councilors with selection via elections. ...|$|R
40|$|The <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> prior <b>consultation</b> and {{compensation}} {{have been established}} {{within the framework of}} international indigenous peoples' rights. However, in practice these processes have often gone hand in hand with adverse social consequences for local populations, such as the exacerbation of conflicts, the division of communities and the weakening of indigenous organizations. These phenomena have received little attention, despite their great relevance for these populations. This article sheds light on the use by the Bolivian state and extraction corporations of exclusionary participation and negotiation processes, on the one hand, and ‘carrot-and-stick’ techniques on the other, which have together accounted for negative social impacts on the ground. The article is based on recently conducted field research, focus group discussions and semi-structured interviews in Guaraní communities in Bolivia. The findings extend the existing literature by providing a fine-grained and systematic analysis of divisive undertakings and their sociocultural and sociopolitical consequences in neo-extractivist Bolivia. The broader implications of the study add to academic debates about participation in development, about ‘divide-and-rule’ tactics and about the practice of indigenous peoples' rights...|$|R
