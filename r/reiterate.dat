25|$|The party's {{official}} stance {{towards the}} incident {{is that the}} use of force was necessary in order to control a 'political disturbance' and that it ensured the stability necessary for economic prosperity. Chinese leaders, including former paramount leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, <b>reiterate</b> this line when questioned by foreign press.|$|E
25|$|The Government of India in 2002 {{published}} the National Blood Policy (NBP) to <b>reiterate</b> {{the commitment to}} safe blood and blood components.

25|$|The Iranian {{ambassador}} to the UK was summoned to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 23 March to see Peter Ricketts, the Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, was asked to explain the incident and told that Britain required the servicemen to be returned. He was summoned again on 24 March to see Lord Triesman, a junior foreign office minister, to <b>reiterate</b> Britain's demand that the personnel be released with their equipment.|$|E
25|$|Imus was {{initially}} given a two-week suspension which {{was scheduled to}} begin on April 16, allowing him to work the annual WFAN Radiothon on April 12 and 13. On consecutive days Imus appeared on both Sharpton's syndicated radio show (April 9) and NBC-TV's Today Show (April 10) to <b>reiterate</b> his regret for the remarks. But on April 11, MSNBC announced the cancellation of the video simulcast of Imus in the Morning. The following day, CBS Radio dismissed Imus, at the time leaving WFAN with a very large programming—and money-earning—void in its schedule.|$|E

25|$|On 27 July, the Swiss Federal Council held {{a special}} {{meeting to discuss}} the crisis. The Council {{announced}} that it deplored the human tragedy of the conflict {{and that it would}} reinforce its humanitarian aid measures; it also allocated CHF 5 million in emergency aid for the ICRC. The government's failure to <b>reiterate</b> the foreign department's criticism of Israel and its decision not to cancel the Swiss cooperation with the Israeli armaments industry were considered by the press to be a rebuke to outspoken Socialist foreign minister Micheline Calmy-Rey by the Council's center-right majority.|$|E
25|$|On November 27, {{about fifty}} {{students}} from Mandalay, Sagaing, Monywa and Myingyan staged an unauthorized protest {{in front of}} City Hall in Mandalay to <b>reiterate</b> their demand: to convene a quadripartite meeting. The police at first stopped the students from exiting Eaindawyar Pagoda, their initial meeting point. The students, however, convinced the police that the officers’ children themselves would benefit from the protests {{and were able to}} march to the City Hall and ended their protest at Mahamuni Buddha Temple, a history significant place where 17 Burmese pro-independence leaders were killed during the colonial era.|$|E
25|$|The {{authors have}} also {{published}} a follow-up paper in Europhysics Letters {{which provides a}} generic framework than {{can be used to}} assess sampling bias in certain social and biological systems. A special case of the framework can be used to derive the results presented in their Journal of Peace Research paper. The authors also investigate the sensitivity of their results to the underlying model parameter values. They <b>reiterate</b> their view that a more precise determination of the model parameters and, hence, the extent of sampling bias, is possible only if the actual micro-level data of the Lancet study are released.|$|E

25|$|The {{prosecution}} {{was conducted}} by Norman Birkett KC, who could only argue that Nodder had abducted the child. Nodder chose not to testify at this hearing, leaving his defence counsel, led by Maurice Healy, to <b>reiterate</b> Nodder's claims that the girl had spent one night at his Peacehaven home before he had given the child two shillings and instructions {{as to how to}} travel to her aunt's Sheffield home, and that he had not seen her since. Healy further argued that Mona may still be found alive and well, and that and no-one should speculate as to her fate.|$|E
25|$|In 2016, psychologists {{confirmed}} {{the relationship between}} social media usage and body image anxieties, dieting, and the goal towards thinness. Based on a survey, 56% of women acknowledged {{the effect of the}} “social media culture in driving the pressure for perfection and negative body image”; whereby it forces them to look a certain way. These platforms further <b>reiterate</b> the need for individuals to compare themselves with others online, resulting in higher expectations towards their standards of beauty. Hence, 42% of women stated social media caused them to feel worse about their bodies, while another study by the University of South Australia, discovered that individuals who frequently uploaded or viewed appearance-related items were more likely to internalise the thin ideal.|$|E
25|$|The {{stabbing}} {{took place}} {{as the result of}} an argument over some opera tickets that a customer, John Finch, the son of the Countess of Winchelsea and brother to Lord Finch, had given to Sally's sister instead of Sally. During the argument in the Three Tuns Tavern in Chandos Street, Covent Garden, Finch and Salisbury both became angry and Salisbury snatched up the knife she had been given with her meal and stabbed Finch in the chest. She was apparently immediately remorseful and called for a surgeon to attend Finch. Finch was gravely ill for some time, but forgave Salisbury on the spot. When he later recovered, he wished to visit her in prison to <b>reiterate</b> his forgiveness.|$|E

25|$|These {{efforts to}} {{undercut}} Gold and the Joint Board also failed. Several IFWU locals outside New York City passed resolutions criticizing the International Union's actions, and worker {{support for the}} Joint Council dwindled even further. On July 6, 1928, the AFL notified the Joint Council that it was withdrawing all staff and monetary support for the rump union. When the news leaked to the leaders of other needle trade unions, President Green was forced to publicly <b>reiterate</b> the AFL's support for the non-communist union. But the new flow of funds and staff did nothing to resuscitate the Joint Council. Worse, from the AFL's perspective, the Joint Board then called several strikes in July 1928 and won major wage increases from the employers.|$|E
25|$|In the Senate {{election}} held in May 2007, Trillanes successfully {{launched a}} nationwide campaign from his prison cell {{as he ran}} and won {{a seat in the}} Philippine Senate on a shoestring budget. He was elected to the Senate as guest candidate for the anti-administration Genuine Opposition ticket, and assumed office on June 30, 2007. He made history for being the first Philippine senator to be elected while in jail when more than 11 million people voted him into office. On November 29, 2007, Trillanes, together with the soldiers facing coup d'état charges in connection with the 2003 Oakwood Mutiny, marched out of the courtroom while attending a hearing towards the Peninsula Manila hotel in Makati City, to <b>reiterate</b> their call for the ouster of then President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo.|$|E
25|$|Especially in Europe, {{there was}} an {{increase}} in rhetoric calling for immediate fiscal tightening, following events such as the Greek debt crisis and the displacement of the UK Labour government with a coalition dominated by the Conservatives after the May 2010 elections. While some high level officials, particularly from the US and India, continued advocating sustained stimulus until the global recovery is better established, a communiqué from the G20, issued after their June 2010 meeting of finance ministers in Busan, welcomed the trend towards fiscal consolidation rather than further deficit financed stimulus. The G20 did <b>reiterate</b> that forceful government intervention had been the correct response in 2008 and 2009. Then IMF managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who had been a leading advocate for stimulus spending from as early as January 2008, said he was comfortable with the reversal.|$|E
