2500|$|In the United States {{there are}} {{groups that have}} some degree of {{protection}} for their <b>regional</b> <b>designation.</b> For example, Vidalia onions must be produced within a certain region around Vidalia, Georgia, {{as defined by the}} Georgia Department of Agriculture, and [...] "100% Florida orange juice" [...] is certified as being such by that state's Department of Citrus.

Tennessee whiskey is straight Bourbon Whiskey produced in the state of Tennessee. This definition is legally established under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which states that Tennessee whiskey is [...] "a straight Bourbon Whiskey authorised to be produced only in the State of Tennessee." [...] There also are cases in which a geographical name has been trademarked for a particular product that might not even be manufactured there, such as Philadelphia cream cheese.

5000|$|The Rolla {{campus was}} first to enact a break from <b>regional</b> <b>designation.</b> On 6 April 2007, the Board of Curators {{approved}} a proposal to rename the school the Missouri University of Science and Technology, effective 1 January 2008. In addition to ridding itself of a <b>regional</b> <b>designation,</b> it also emphasizes the school's technological research mission. This quickly catalyzed a long-dormant [...] "name restoration" [...] campaign at the Columbia campus to drop its <b>regional</b> <b>designation.</b> This proposal met with considerable criticism, mainly from the Kansas City and St. Louis campuses, who saw this as unnecessary or unfair and an intentional detriment to their campuses. On 29 November 2007, the Board of Curators voted unanimously to allow the Columbia campus to use the generic University of Missouri name for essentially all public purposes, but not when dealing with [...] "official business" [...] such as budget documents, legal contracts, and other internal UM System documentation, or whenever clarification from the system or other campuses is needed. Use of the generic name is not compulsory and the Columbia designation may continue {{to be used in}} any context.

Proponents of the change say that it simply provides clarification and recognizes what has always been common usage, but the issue remains controversial.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} generic name, the University of Missouri, was {{not officially}} assigned {{to any of}} the schools or the system.

5000|$|From {{the late}} 1980s, and {{more so in}} the 1990s, Austrian wine moved into new styles, which {{primarily}} meant less semi-sweet and sweet white wines, and more dry white wines and red wines. For these dry wines, the Prädikatswein designations (such as Spätlese or Auslese) shared with the German wine classification system, were seen as less suitable. Just as in Germany, much of the high-end dry wines therefore ended up using a designation, Qualitätswein, which in principle was seen as below the Prädikatswein. In Wachau, <b>regional</b> <b>designations</b> for dry wines were created as a response; Steinfeder, Federspiel and Smaragd. However, several organisations pressed in the 1990s for a different national system to be introduced, with [...] "appellation-style" [...] designations based on geographical origin rather than on must weight, with regulations for each DAC regarding allowed grape varieties and wine styles.|$|R
