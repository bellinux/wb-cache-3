25|$|To {{raise the}} general {{standard}} of civil ceremonies, given {{what they saw}} as the excessively legal cultural context they had inherited, they encouraged each couple to see more creative possibilities in the ceremony than the two of them might originally have envisaged. In this context the celebrant, as a <b>resource</b> <b>person,</b> needed to educate himself/herself in the artistic treasures of western culture appropriate for ceremony creation i.e. in poetry, prose, music, choreography, storytelling and symbolism i.e. the components of ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Civil celebrants {{also serve}} {{people who have}} {{religious}} beliefs but {{do not wish to}} be married in a church, temple or mosque. In contrast to the established ceremonies of religious or registry office authorities, in celebrant ceremonies many decisions about the content are chosen by the couple. Therefore, the civil celebrant has come to be defined as a professionally trained ceremony-provider who works in accordance with the wishes of the client couple. The task may be like an architect who is charged with designing a dream home for a couple who need expert help. In this sense the celebrant is not just the one who performs the ceremony according to law, but its facilitator, the couple's adviser, the <b>resource</b> <b>person,</b> the co-creator of the ceremony, and the rehearsal-director.|$|E
