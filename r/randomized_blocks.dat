40|$|This {{bulletin}} {{consists of}} an examination {{from the point of}} view of accuracy of the results of 93 lattice or lattice square designs used in corn varietal tests during the period 1938 - 40, inclusive. For the triple lattice designs at Iowa State College, three replications were on the average somewhat more accurate than five replications of the type of <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks</b> design previously used. Since part of this increase in accuracy was presumably due to the long and narrow shape of replication in the <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks</b> designs, somewhat smaller increases would be expected over a <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks</b> design with a more compact replication. For the lattice square designs, the increase in accuracy over <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks</b> represents a saving of about one replication in six with 25 varieties, one replication in five with 49 or 81 varieties and one replication in three with 121 varieties...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT In field experiments, it {{is often}} assumed that errors are {{statistically}} independent, but not always this condition is met, compromising the results. An inappropriate choice of the analytical model can compromise the efficiency of breeding programs in preventing unpromising genotypes from being selected and maintained in the next selection cycles resulting in {{waste of time and}} resources. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the spatial dependence of errors in experiments evaluating grain yield of bean progenies using analyses in lattice and <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks.</b> And also evaluate the efficiency of geostatistical models to describe the structure of spatial variability of errors. The data used in this study derived from experiments arranged in the lattice design and analyzed as lattice or as <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks.</b> The Durbin-Watson test was used to verify the existence of spatial autocorrelation. The theoretical semivariogram was fitted using geostatistical models (exponential, spherical and Gaussian) to describe the spatial variability of errors. The likelihood ratio test was applied to assess the significance of the geostatistical model parameters. Of the eight experiments evaluated, five had moderate spatial dependence for the <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks</b> analysis and one for both analyses, in lattice and <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks.</b> The area of the experiments was not a determinant factor of the spatial dependence. The spherical, exponential and Gaussian geostatistical models with nugget effect were suitable to represent the spatial structure in the randomized block analysis. The analysis in lattice was efficient to ensure the independence of errors...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} minimizing block-separable (non-smooth) convex functions subject to linear constraints. While the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for two-block linear constraints has been intensively studied both theoretically and empirically, in spite of some preliminary work, effective generalizations of ADMM to multiple blocks is still unclear. In this paper, we propose a parallel <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> coordinate method named Parallel Direction Method of Multipliers (PDMM) to solve optimization problems with multi-block linear constraints. At each iteration, PDMM randomly updates some blocks in parallel, behaving like parallel <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> coordinate descent. We establish the global convergence and the iteration complexity for PDMM with constant step size. We also show that PDMM can do <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> coordinate descent on overlapping blocks. Experimental results show that PDMM performs better than state-of-the-arts methods in two applications, robust principal component analysis and overlapping group lasso. ...|$|R

40|$|Background and purpose: This {{paper is}} {{intended}} to assist pharmacologists {{to make the most}} of statistical analysis and in avoid common errors. Approach: A scenario is presented where an experimenter performed an experiment to test the effects of two drugs on cultured cells. Analysis of the results, expressed as percentage of control, by a one-way ANOVA yielded P 0. 058 and the experimenter concluded that neither drug was effective. The data were expressed as percentage of control because of pairing of the data within each experimental run, a common feature in cell culture experiments. Such data can be analysed with potentially more powerful ANOVA methods equivalent to the paired t-test. Monte Carlo simulations are presented to compare the power of relevant analyses. Results: For data correlated within experimental run (i. e. paired values), transformation to percentage of control improved the power of a one-way ANOVA to detect a real effect, but a <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> ANOVA (equivalent to a 2 -way ANOVA with experiment and treatment as factors) using the raw values was substantially more powerful. The <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> ANOVA performed well even with uncorrelated data, being only marginally less powerful than the one-way ANOVA. Conclusions and implications: A <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> ANOVA is far superior to the one-way ANOVA with correlated data, and with uncorrelated data it is only marginally less powerful. Thus where there is, or might reasonably be, such a correlation (e. g. relatedness among the data within a single experimental run, or within a multi-well culture plate, or within an animal, et cetera), use the more powerful <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> ANOVA rather than one-way ANOVA...|$|R

40|$|The {{resistance}} of 24 potato genotypes to B. tabaci (Genn.) biotype B (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) was evaluated in five greenhouse experiments. The first experiment we evaluated the attractiveness and preference for oviposition in a free-choice test (<b>randomized</b> <b>blocks,</b> 24 treatments, and eight replications). In two other experiments we evaluated no-choice preference for oviposition (<b>randomized</b> <b>blocks,</b> six treatments, and ten replications). The whitefly egg-adult cycle was monitored using a statistical design in <b>randomized</b> <b>blocks</b> with five replications. Trichome density was evaluated {{in an experiment}} with 24 treatments and six replications, in a completely randomized design. In the free-choice test, potato genotypes NYL 235 - 4 and IAC- 1966 were the most attractive to adults, while cultivars Achat, Aracy Ruiva, and Monte Bonito presented the lowest number of adults. Also in this assay, cultivars Achat, Ibituaçu, Panda, IAC- 1966, and Agata presented the lowest number of eggs, while in the no-choice test, only cultivar Achat and IAC- 1966 remained resistant. Consequently, for these two genotypes non-preference is the oviposition resistance mechanism. The egg-adult cycle varied from 21 days (cultivar Panda) to 22. 5 days (clones IAC- 1966 and NYL 235 - 4). The adult emergence varied from 91. 2 % (clone IAC- 1966) to 99. 3 % (cultivar Ibituaçu). Clone NYL 235 - 4 had {{the greatest number of}} simple (ST) and glandular (GT) trichomes; while clone IAC- 1966 had the lowest number of ST and, clone IAC- 6290, of GT.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> {{coordinate}} non-monotone gradient (RBCNMG) method for minimizing the sum of a smooth (possibly nonconvex) function and a block-separable (possibly nonconvex nonsmooth) function. At each iteration, this method randomly picks a block according to any prescribed probability distribution and typically solves several associated proximal subproblems that usually have a closed-form solution, until a certain sufficient reduction on the objective function is achieved. We show that the sequence of expected objective values generated by this method converges to the expected value of the limit of the objective value sequence produced by a random single run. Moreover, the solution sequence generated by this method is arbitrarily close to an approximate stationary point with high probability. When the problem under consideration is convex, we further establish that the sequence of expected objective values generated by this method converges to the optimal value of the problem. In addition, the objective value sequence is arbitrarily close to the optimal value with high probability. We also conduct some preliminary experiments to test the performance of our RBCNMG method on the ` 1 -regularized least-squares problem. The computational results demonstrate that our method substantially outperform the <b>randomized</b> <b>block</b> coordinate descent method proposed in [16].
