40|$|Polarization {{sensitive}} <b>reflectometric</b> {{measurements are}} effective tools for {{the characterization of}} polarization properties of optical-fiber link. The field of application of these techniques depends on whether they use a continuous wave source or a pulsed source to generate the probe signal. In the first case, <b>reflectometric</b> techniques may be successfully applied to perform single-end measurement of differential group delay and polarization dependent loss. In the second case - {{that is the case}} of polarization sensitive optical time domain reflectometry - the local birefringence of a single mode fiber can be measured and characterized.

40|$|Polarization {{sensitive}} <b>reflectometric</b> {{measurements are}} effective tools for {{the characterization of}} polarization properties of optical-fiber links. These techniques show two advantages compared with the standard ones: they can perform measurements using only one fiber end (both for transmission and for reception of the probe signal) and, most important, they can characterize the local evolution of the polarization properties of the fiber link. <b>Reflectometric</b> measurements of differential group delay and fiber birefringence have been already successfully performed. More recently, the possibility of measuring also polarization dependent loss has been theoretically explored.

40|$|A four channel pulsed radar {{reflectometer}} {{system has}} been installed on the Large Helical Device (LHD). The complicated magnetic structure in LHD causes mode conversion and/or polarization rotation of the microwaves. Pulsed radar reflectometry is a suitable <b>reflectometric</b> technique, because it measures the delay time of the reflected wave, not the phase, and X-mode and O-mode polarized waves can be distinguished. By using X-mode operation of the pulsed radar reflectometer so that each pulse width is about 2 ns, and the repetition rate is up to 200 kHz, the critical density where the microwave is reflected is about 1 × 10 ^ 16 m^? 3.

40|$|Polarization {{sensitive}} <b>reflectometric</b> {{techniques can}} be effectively used to perform spatially resolved measurements of polarization properties of fiber optic link - such as birefringence, polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent loss. In particular, this contribution {{is focused on}} polarization sensitive OTDR and provides a survey of its theory and main applications. Special emphasis {{is given to the}} characterization of fiber birefringence, that allows to inspect the fiber while cabled and, consequently, to test and improve the cabling process. In addition, the analysis of the birefringence also allows to define reliable mathematical models, which are essential for the design of low polarization mode dispersion fibers. <b>Reflectometric</b> measurements of polarization mode dispersion and polarization dependent loss are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis work {{addresses}} {{the use of}} fixed-angle laser reflectometry to follow in situ the deposition of self-assembled polyelectrolyte films in a large domain of thickness. It is shown theoretically and illustrated experimentally that the <b>reflectometric</b> output can be interpreted in terms of refractive index and thickness way above the usual range which covers the earlier deposition steps of the polymers (i. e., 30 - 50 layers, depending on the film composition). Thick films containing up to 320 deposition steps (160 bilayers) {{were made in the}} <b>reflectometric</b> cell with the polymer pair poly(allylamine, hydrochloride) and poly(styrene sulfonate) on a silica substrate. They were imaged with AFM, and their thickness was measured using the focused ion beam (FIB) technique. In the course of construction, the <b>reflectometric</b> data started to alternate more or less regularly between positive and negative values, exhibiting absolute values at the extrema which decreased progressively. This phenomenon was coherent with simulated data, once the diffusion of the incident beam and the change of refractive index were taken into account. The phenomenon gives an opportunity to evaluate the composition and the mean thickness of the film during the growth, which is confirmed by comparison with the FIB measurements...|$|E

40|$|Some {{years ago}} we {{developed}} an automatized <b>reflectometric</b> method to measure the surface azimuthal anchoring energy of nematic liquid crystals on an optically isotropic substrate. This method provides a high accuracy and sensitivity but {{requires the use of}} wedge glass plates and a sufficiently high anisotropy of the intensity reflectivity coefficients. This latter condition restricts greatly the number of possible substrates that can be investigated with this technique. Here we develop a new <b>reflectometric</b> method which offers comparable or better accuracy and sensitivity but does not require wedge plates and high anisotropy of the reflectivity coefficients. The method is fully automated and provides a direct measurement of the azimuthal director angle. The experimental procedure exploits the dependence of the reflectivity tensor on the surface director orientation. The measurement of the azimuthal angle does not require any knowledge of the optical parameters of the nematic material and of the optically isotropic substrate, and provides an absolute accuracy better than 0. 2 degrees in the whole range 0 - 360 degrees and a sensitivity better than 0. 1 degrees. This <b>reflectometric</b> method can be also used with weakly anisotropic substrates as well as thin rubbed polymeric layers. In this latter case, the effective uncertainty in the measurement of the director azimuthal angle depends on the substrate anisotropy. A simple and direct experimental procedure to estimate this uncertainty is proposed...|$|E

40|$|Results of the {{measurements}} of water {{content in the}} topsoil layer (1 - 6 cm) in fields with various crops obtained by gravimetric and <b>reflectometric</b> (TDR) methods {{have been used for}} the calculations of soil volumetric heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and diffusivity. Calculation values of individual soil thermal properties obtained in the two ways were then analysed by means of statistical and geostatistical methods and compared (correlation coefficients, regression equations, difference distributions, mean square errors, and maximum relative errors were determined). Compatibility of values of thermal properties as determined on the basis of soil moisture measured by means of gravimetric and TDR methods, was generally speaking, satisfactory, even though not uniform in various soil moisture ranges; it is better with higher moisture levels, and worse when moisture levels were low. More accuracy in spatial distribution of thermal properties obtained on the basis of soil moisture as measured by gravimetric than by <b>reflectometric</b> method points to the lower sensitivity of the TDR method for the soil moisture measurements...|$|E
40|$|Current optical <b>reflectometric</b> {{techniques}} used to characterize optical fibers have to trade-off longitudinal range with spatial resolution and therefore struggle to provide simultaneously {{wide dynamic range}} (> 20 dB) and high resolution (< 10 cm). In this work, we develop and present a technique we refer to as Optical Side Scattering Radiometry (OSSR) capable of resolving discrete and distributed scattering properties of fibers along their length with up to 60 dB dynamic range and 5 cm spatial resolution. Our setup is first validated on a standard single mode telecoms fiber. Then we apply it to a record-length 11 km hollow core photonic band-gap fiber (HC-PBGF) the characterization requirements of which lie far beyond the capability of standard optical <b>reflectometric</b> instruments. We next demonstrate use of the technique to investigate and explain the unusually high loss observed in another HC-PBGF and finally demonstrate its flexibility by measuring a HC-PBGF operating at a wavelength of 2 µm. In all of these examples, good agreement between the OSSR measurements and other well-established (but more limited) characterization methods, i. e. cutback loss and OTDR, was obtained...|$|E

40|$|When {{measuring}} {{very low}} differential group delay (DGD), standard techniques {{are affected by}} rather high uncertainties. This problem is usually solved by repeating many times the DGD measurements while randomly perturbing the fiber. Such an approach is founded on the basic assumption that polarization scrambling induces the DGD's decorrelation. Nevertheless, {{it has not been}} proved yet that the measured DGDs belong to an homogeneous statistical ensemble. We experimentally validate this approach by means of polarization-sensitive <b>reflectometric</b> measurements...|$|E
40|$|In this work, three {{strategies}} for shortening the output pulse of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) are reported. The first strategy is passive filtering, where band-pass filtering removes the lowest frequency {{components in the}} signal, getting a noticeable reduction in pulse width (a compression ratio of 10 : 1 was obtained). In the second place, a <b>reflectometric</b> scheme is proposed where the amplified signal coming from the SiPM is injected into a signal splitter with one of its stubs connected to a short-circuited stub. In the last strategy, the <b>reflectometric</b> part is replaced by an analog subtractor circuit. In this approach, a signal splitter with stubs of different lengths is used. All solutions provide good compression ratios, up to 10 : 1. Best pulses obtained are single narrow peaks, with width below 10 ns, preserving the photonic modulation and with good pseudo-Gaussian shape, single polarity and low ringing. The potential of pulse shortening for improving the capability of the detector to resolve single photons is demonstrated by mean of single photon counting patterns. The detection error probability is reduced in one order of magnitude when shortening is used for conditioning the output photosignal...|$|E
40|$|Some {{years ago}} we {{proposed}} an automated <b>reflectometric</b> method to measure the director azimuthal angle at the interface between a nematic liquid crystal and another medium. The method ensures a great accuracy and sensitivity and is virtually unaffected {{by the presence of}} a director bulk distortion. This latter property makes it possible to measure strong anchoring energies. In the present experiment, we use this method to measure the azimuthal anchoring energy at the interface between the nematic liquid crystal 4 -pentyl- 4 (') -cyanobiphenyl (5 CB) and a rubbed polyimide layer. This kind of interface is characterized by a strong azimuthal anchoring and, thus, it represents a good test for the proposed <b>reflectometric</b> method. An ac planar electric field is applied to a nematic layer and the consequent azimuthal rotation of the director at the interface is measured. The anchoring energy coefficient W-a at room temperature is strong (W-a= 0. 33 x 10 (- 3) J/m(2)) and decreases greatly as the clearing temperature is approached. The time response of the azimuthal surface director angle to a stepwise electric field evidences the characteristic slow dynamics which is currently observed for weak anchoring substrates...|$|E

The simultaneous determination of electrosurface characteristics and the optical thickness of interfacial layers provides information on structural variations of adsorbed or covalently bound polymers and on charge dependent adsorption and desorption phenomena at solid/liquid interfaces. To demonstrate the potentialities of this extended approach for biointerfacial studies the authors report a series of experiments on the adsorption of the plasma protein fibrinogen at poly(octadecene-alt-maleic acid) thin films.|$|E
30|$|In {{an earlier}} study the growth regimes of both PEM systems were {{investigated}} by using <b>reflectometric</b> interference spectroscopy [17]. Both revealed a non-linear increase in the optical film thickness with a higher growth rate for (PLL-PGA)n films. The ATR-FTIR spectra underline the non-linear growth of both films and support the steeper increase in film growth of the (PLL-PGA)n multilayer. According to the “in and out diffusion model” for exponential film growth this difference {{may be attributed to}} the different degrees of diffusibility of PLL chains in PEMs when complexed with PGA or CS [26].|$|E

40|$|International audienceSelf-assembled {{multilayered}} {{films were}} prepared by alternate deposition {{of a strong}} cationic polyelectrolyte, poly(trimethylammonium ethyl methacrylate chloride) and a pH-dependant anionic polyelectrolyte, poly (acrylic acid). The layer-by-layer adsorption was followed in-situ by optical fixed-angle reflectometry and after drying by ellipsometry. A recently developed “substrate thickness method” was applied to calculate the adsorbed amount of polymer from the <b>reflectometric</b> signal. Surface film morphology was imaged before and after drying with atomic force microscopy (AFM). Influence {{of the number of}} adsorbed layers, concentration and type of salts on the multilayer growth was examined. The number of adsorbed layers produced a specific effect on the <b>reflectometric</b> signal which is linked to the refractive index of the film. Adjustment of the adsorbed amount of polyelectrolytes was done by changing sodium chloride salt concentration within a range of 10 − 3 to 10 − 1 M. AFM observations showed a significant evolution in surface morphology and a maximum of surface roughness for films built-up at 10 − 2 M. Experiments were then carried out at 10 − 3 M in either barium chloride or zinc chloride salts. In the presence of Ba 2 + and Zn 2 + ions, adsorption of 5 bilayers is completely modified and the surface morphology was smoother than the multilayers obtained using sodium chloride salt...|$|E
40|$|Abstract For {{detection}} of low concentrations of analytes in complex biological matrices using optical biosensors, a high surface loading with capture molecules {{and a low}} nonspecific binding of nonrelevant matrix molecules are essential. To tailor biosensor surfaces in such a manner, poly(ethylene glycols) (PEG) in varying lengths were immobilised covalently onto glass-type surfaces in different mixing ratios and concentrations, and were subsequently modified with three different kinds of receptors. The nonspecific binding of a model protein (ovalbumin, OVA) and the maximum loading of the respective analytes to these prepared surfaces were monitored using label-free and time-resolved <b>reflectometric</b> interference spectroscopy (RIfS). The three different analytes used varied in size: 150 kDa for the anti-atrazine antibody, 60 kDa for streptavidin and 5 kDa for the 15 -bp oligonucleotide. We investigated if the mixing of PEG in different lengths could increase the surface loadings of analyte mimicking a three-dimensional matrix as was found using dextrans as sensor coatings. In addition, {{the effect on the}} surface loading was investigated with regard {{to the size of the}} analyte molecule using such mixed PEGs on the sensor surface. For further characterisation of the surface coatings, polarisation mod-ulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and ellipsometry were applied.
