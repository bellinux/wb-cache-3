25|$|According to Gee, {{there are}} at least two <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should {{consider}} literacy in broader terms than the traditional conception of literacy as the ability to read and write. First, in our world today, language is by no means the only communication system available. Many types of visual images and symbols have specific significances, and so “visual literacies” and literacies of other modes, or the concept of multimodal literacy, are also included in Gee’s conception of new literacies. Second, Gee proposes that reading and writing (the ‘meat’ of literacy according to the traditional notion of the term) are not such obvious ideas as they first appear. “After all,” he states, “we never just read or write; rather, we always read or write something in some way”. In other words, according to which type of text we read there are different ways in which we read depending on the “rules” of how to read such a text. Literacy to Gee, even if it is the traditional print-based literacy, should be conceived as being multiple, or comprising different literacies, since we need different types of literacies to read different kinds of texts in ways that meet our particular purposes in reading them.|$|E
500|$|In the lockout-shortened 2012–13 NHL season, both goaltenders {{split the}} playing duties {{although}} Schneider {{was the number}} one goalie. Luongo handled his demotion with class and remained supportive of Schneider, soon calling the Canucks [...] "Cory's team." [...] Head coach Alain Vigneault said [...] "Cory is our MVP and one of <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> got into playoffs. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him and that's why we're going with him". In the opening playoff round facing the San Jose Sharks, as Schneider had been injured {{near the end of the}} regular season, Luongo started the first two games and played well but his team lost both. Luongo came off the bench in game three after Schneider was pulled in the third period. Luongo was the backup in game four as the Canucks lost in overtime, ending his team's postseason in four straight games. Luongo put his penthouse up for sale, as it was accepted that he had played his final game as a Canuck. Although he had nine years left on a 12-year, $64-million contract, which represented a $5.33 million salary cap hit, general manager Mike Gillis remained confident of making a deal in the summer.|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but I still think the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

2500|$|True to his {{empirical}} thesis, Hume {{tells the}} reader that, though testimony {{does have some}} force, it is never quite as powerful as the direct evidence of the senses. That said, he provides some <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> may have a basis for trust in the testimony of persons: because a) human memory can be relatively tenacious; and b) because people are inclined to tell the truth, and ashamed of telling falsities. Needless to say, these reasons are only to be trusted {{to the extent that}} they conform to experience. (Hume 1974:389) ...|$|E
2500|$|In October 2009, the Colorado Springs Independent {{published}} the first extensive interview with Haggard {{to appear in}} the secular press since the 2006 scandal. Over the course of a 2½-hour interview, the former pastor talked about the scandal, his agreement never to return to New Life or the state of Colorado, suicidal ideas, and the prospect of starting a new church in Colorado Springs. [...] "Back in the old days," [...] said Haggard, [...] "when somebody would get in trouble, they'd just need to move 40 or 50 miles, or a hundred miles, and they could start again. Not anymore. Which is one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> needed to come home. Because I needed to finish this story from here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 30 April 1943, Pius XII {{wrote to}} Bishop Graf von Preysing of Berlin to say: [...] "We {{give to the}} pastors who {{are working on the}} local level the duty of {{determining}} if and to what degree the danger of reprisals and of various forms of oppression occasioned by episcopal declarations... ad maiora mala vitanda (to avoid worse)... seem to advise caution. Here lies one of the <b>reasons,</b> <b>why</b> <b>We</b> impose self-restraint on Ourselves in our speeches; the experience, that we made in 1942 with papal addresses, which We authorized to be forwarded to the Believers, justifies our opinion, as far as We see.... The Holy See has done whatever was in its power, with charitable, financial and moral assistance. To say nothing of the substantial sums which we spent in American money for the fares of immigrants." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although these {{specific}} indicia of California's intent in enacting 25524.2 {{are subject to}} varying interpretation, there are two further <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> should not become embroiled in attempting to ascertain California's true motive. First, inquiry into legislative motive is often an unsatisfactory venture. United States v. O'Brien, 391 [...] U.S. 367, 383 (1968). What motivates one legislator {{to vote for a}} statute is not necessarily what motivates scores of others to enact it. Second, it would be particularly pointless for us to engage in such inquiry here when {{it is clear that the}} States have been allowed to retain authority over the need for electrical generating facilities easily sufficient to permit a State so inclined to halt the construction of new nuclear plants by refusing on economic grounds to issue certificates of public convenience in individual proceedings. In these circumstances, it should be up to Congress to determine whether a State has misused the authority left in its hands.|$|E

So that was one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>why</b> <b>we</b> did that, and it's just...it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe...it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know...you decide." ...|$|E
