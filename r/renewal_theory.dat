40|$|Abstract — We {{model the}} goodput {{of a single}} TCP source on a {{wireless}} link experiencing sudden increases in RTT, i. e., delay spikes. Such spikes trigger spurious timeouts that reduce the TCP goodput. <b>Renewal</b> reward <b>theory</b> is used to derive a straightforward expression for TCP goodput {{that takes into account}} limited sending rates (limited window size), lost packets due to congestion and the delay spike properties such as the average spike duration and distribution of the spike intervals. The basic model is for i. i. d. spike intervals, and correlated spike intervals are modelled by using a modulating background Markov chain. Validation by ns 2 simulations shows excellent agreement for lossless scenarios and good accuracy for moderate loss scenarios (for packet loss probabilities less than 5 %). Numerical studies have also been performed {{to assess the impact of}} different spike interval distributions on TCP performance.

The equilibrium situation is given by the Henryûs Law Constant of the compound, but is rarely attained under environmental conditions. Approach to equilibrium is commonly described by the two-film theory involving molecular (Fickian) diffusion through thin stagnant films adjacent to the air-water interface. This theory is formulated in terms of mass transfer coefficients and fugacity transport parameters. Penetration and Surface <b>Renewal</b> <b>Theories</b> of mass transfer are also discussed.

40|$|AbstractSurface <b>renewal</b> <b>theories</b> {{have gained}} recognition, {{prominence}} and widespread acceptance in explaining mass transfer processes at interfaces that become turbulent. Eddies are envisaged as being impelled into the interface from the bulk phase in mechanically stirred systems where they renew {{the surface with}} fresh liquid or fluid in a dynamic process. The effect of surface active agents {{has been known to}} damp mass transfer by inhibiting tangential eddy movements, hence surface renewal, and confirmed experimentally. Since the problem is dynamic, the mode of eddy propagation into the interface and the amount of area renewed are visualized as important factors in determining mass transfer across turbulent interfaces. The purpose of this paper was to construct a mathematical model which reveals the relative importance of the surface compressional modulus of elasticity Cs− 1, as opposed to the degree of agitation, which is synonymous with turbulence, hence Reynolds number, as each one tends to offset the other in mass transfer processes. The results are extremely important in industrial processes as they affect design and efficiency, as surface active agents become an undesirable nuisance in retarding mass transfer in both mixing and extraction processes and could prove to be well nigh indispensable...|$|R

40|$|Age {{replacement}} of technical units has received much {{attention in the}} reliability literature {{over the last four}} decades. Mostly, the failure time distribution for the units is assumed to be known, and minimal costs per unit of time is used as optimality criterion, where <b>renewal</b> reward <b>theory</b> simplifies the mathematics involved but requires the assumption that the same process and replacement strategy continues over a very large (‘infinite’) period of time. Recently, there has been increasing attention to adaptive strategies for age replacement, taking into account the information from the process. Although <b>renewal</b> reward <b>theory</b> can still be used to provide an intuitively and mathematically attractive optimality criterion, it is more logical to use minimal costs per unit of time over a single cycle as optimality criterion for adaptive age replacement. In this paper, we first show that in the classical age replacement setting, with known failure time distribution with increasing hazard rate, the one-cycle criterion leads to earlier replacement than the renewal reward criterion. Thereafter, we present adaptive age replacement with a one-cycle criterion within the nonparametric predictive inferential framework. We study the performance of this approach via simulations, which are also used for comparisons {{with the use of the}} renewal reward criterion within the same statistical framework.

40|$|Abstract The M/M/k/setup model, {{where there}} is a penalty for turning servers on, is common in data centers, call centers, and {{manufacturing}} systems. Setup costs {{take the form of a}} time delay, and sometimes there is additionally a power penalty, as in the case of data centers. While the M/M/ 1 /setup was exactly analyzed in 1964, no exact analysis exists to date for the M/M/k/setup with k> 1. In this paper, we provide the first exact, closed-form analysis for the M/M/k/setup and some of its important vari-ants including systems in which idle servers delay for a period of time before turning off or can be put to sleep. Our analysis is made possible by a new way of combining <b>renewal</b> reward <b>theory</b> and recursive techniques to solve Markov chains with a repeat-ing structure. Our renewal-based approach uses ideas from <b>renewal</b> reward <b>theory</b> and busy period analysis to obtain closed-form expressions for metrics of interest such as the transform of time in system and the transform of power consumed by the system. The simplicity, intuitiveness, and versatility of our renewal-based approach makes it useful for analyzing Markov chains far beyond the M/M/k/setup. In general, our renewal-based approach should be used to reduce the analysis of any 2 -dimensional Markov chain which is infinite in at most one dimension and repeating to the prob-lem of solving a system of polynomial equations.
