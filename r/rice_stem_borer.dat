The use of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) toxins has been explored as a means to control this pest, but the potential for C. suppressalis to develop resistance to Bt toxins makes this approach problematic.

Up to the present about 5000 specimens of the so-called Chilo suppressalis have been gathered from 53 localities in 22 prefectures for taxonomic re-examination. Among them we have examined 645 specimens from 3 G localities and could find 36 male specimens of Chilo hyrax from 8 localities in Akita, Niigata, Fukui, Kagawa and Fukuoka Prefectures. Male of this species may be distinguished from those of suppressalis by the following characters. Frons with a distinct projecting edge just before the ventral margin. Forewing much darker than suppressalis; greyish brown patches on discocellulars and just below discoidal cell absent, rarely visible. Length of forewing slightly longer than suppressalis: 10. 1 - 14. 1 mm. Male genitalia sclerotized more heavily than suppressalis; juxta slender with a small tooth near apex, without enlargement; cephalic end of vinculum somewhat enlarged in lateral view. The characters to distinguish the females of both species given by Bleszynski are quite unreliable because of their wide variation. Therefore, it is our urgent need to establish the female characters to distinguish the species. The present specimens were found from the materials of both first and second emergence of moth of 2 ̆ 2 C. suppressalis. 2 ̆ 2 Therefore, this species {{is thought to have}} at least two generations a year. The earlier stages and host plants of this species are unknown. However, it is supposed that this species may attack the rice plant, and the larva may be closely allied to that of suppressalis judging by the present morphological knowledge of this genus.

40|$|Rice is {{the main}} crop of Taiwan. Although the {{cultivated}} areas of rice decreased gradually in recent years, it is still very important for rice pest control. There are three major <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> in Taiwan which cause dead heart and white head of rice. They are Sesamia inferens (Walker) of Noctuidae, Chilo suppressalis (Walker) and Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker) of Pyralidae. During the past two years, the distribution of <b>rice</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> {{in the first and}} the secondary crops from Tainan, Chiayi, Changhua, Taichung, Miaoli, Hsinchu and Taoyuan of Taiwan was surveyed in our laboratory. Increase of S. inferens number in central and southern counties was observed and this situation is getting obvious over each cropping period. The lack of chemical controlling data to S. inferens had urged us to understand the susceptibility of S. inferens to insecticides used for C. suppressalis control. Chlorpyrifos, carbofuran, cartap, permethrin, and spinosad belonging to three modes of action were evaluated. The results showed that S. inferens in Chiayi has developed 17 -fold resistance against spinosad. Although {{there was no significant difference}} in susceptibility among S. inferens populations to other tested insecticides, differential susceptibilities of chlorpyrifos and carbofuran were observed in S. inferens and C. suppressalis which share the same habitat. Carbofuran, which had lost its activity on the C. suppressalis of Changhua and Chiayi, still possessed more than 1000 -fold activity on all tested populations of S. inferens. On the contrary, chlorpyrifos which was highly toxic to C. suppressalis took much higher dosage (200 ~ 600 -fold) to control S. inferens. The enzyme kinetic assays of S. inferens and C. suppressalis acetylcholinesterases (AChE) showed that an increasing in Km of S. inferens AChE and variations in inhibition patterns of carbofuran and chlorpyrifos oxon on S. inferens and C. suppressalis AChE might result in differential susceptibilities of both <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> to chlorpyrifos and carbofuran. 水稻是台灣最主要的糧食作物，雖然近年來的耕種面積逐漸減少，但是防治水稻害蟲仍然相當重要。在台灣會造成水稻枯心或是白穗的蛀心蟲主要有三種，分別為屬於夜蛾科的大螟(Sesamia inferens (Walker)) ，以及屬於螟蛾科的二化螟(Chilo suppressalis (Walker)) 和三化螟(Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker)) 。根據本實驗室近兩年來，由南往北對台南、嘉義、彰化、台中、苗栗、新竹、桃園等地之一、二期水稻進行採集調查的結果發現，大螟在中南部地區發生數量增加，有日趨嚴重的現象。由於目前在水稻針對大螟的防治資料並不多，因此本實驗是以陶斯松、加保扶、培丹、百滅寧、賜諾殺等三種不同作用機制的五種常用藥劑，對各地區的大螟進行藥劑測試，以瞭解大螟目前對常用藥劑的感受性。結果顯示，除了嘉義地區大螟對於賜諾殺有較高的抗性比之外，其他各地區大螟對藥劑的感受性差異並不多。然而在比較相同地區大螟及二化螟對藥劑的感受性時，發現二者對陶斯松與加保扶的感受性不同。加保扶對彰化、嘉義的二化螟幾乎沒有防治效果，對大螟仍然有效。對二化螟的防治效果極佳的陶斯松，對大螟卻需要較高的劑量。進一步檢測大螟與二化螟的乙醯膽鹼酯酶，以及加保扶與陶斯松對這兩種水稻蛀心蟲的乙醯膽鹼酯酶之抑制形式發現，大螟乙醯膽鹼酯酶對碘化硫代乙醯膽鹼有較高的Km。除此之外，陶斯松與加保扶對這兩種水稻蛀心蟲乙醯膽鹼酯酶的抑制方式，也顯示出不同抑制模式。Km的差異與不同的抑制方式可能是造成這兩種水稻蛀心蟲對陶斯松和加保扶的感受性不一樣的原因。摘要 [...] -i Abstract [...] -iii 目錄 [...] -iv 前言 [...] - 1 前人研究 [...] - 2 材料與方法 [...] - 9 結果 [...] - 20 討論 [...] - 24 引用文獻 [...] - 30 圖表 [...] - 37 附表 [...] - 5...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{transgenic}} rice lines Kemingdao 1 (KMD 1) and Kemingdao 2 (KMD 2) contain a synthetic cry 1 Ab gene derived from Bacillus thuringiensis Berliner and are highly resistant to <b>rice</b> <b>stem</b> <b>borers</b> and foliage-feeding lepidopterans. Propylea japonica (Coleoptera: Coccinel-lidae) {{is an important}} predator of rice insect pests; it also uses rice pollen as a food source under natural condi-tions. In the present study, the effects of KMD 1 and KMD 2 pollen expressing Cry 1 Ab protein on the fitness of P. japonica were assessed in the laboratory. P. japonica larvae and adults were provided with the fol-lowing four diets: KMD 1 pollen with the aphid Myzus persicae, KMD 2 pollen with M. persicae, nontransgenic Xiushui 11 (parent variety of KMD 1 and KMD 2) pollen with M. persicae, and M. persicae only (KMD 1 –pollen, KMD 2 –pollen, XS 11 –pollen, and aphid treatments, respectively). The {{results showed that the}} longevity of female adults in the KMD 1 –pollen treatment was sig-nificantly lower than that in the XS 11 –pollen treatment, but was not significantly different from that in the KMD 2 –pollen and aphid treatments. Newly emerged males in the KMD 2 –pollen treatment were evidently less vital than those in the XS 11 –pollen treatment, but not significantly different from those in the KMD 1 –pollen and aphid treatments. The development, survival and reproduction indices for the three pollen treatments did not differ significantly from one another. In short, Bt toxin expressed in Bt rice pollen had no evident negative impacts on P. japonica fitness when the pollen was used as a food by this beetle...|$|R
