5|$|The most {{conclusive}} aqueous chemistry {{studies of}} <b>rutherfordium</b> {{have been performed}} by the Japanese team at Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute using the isotope 261mRf. Extraction experiments from hydrochloric acid solutions using isotopes of <b>rutherfordium,</b> hafnium, zirconium, {{as well as the}} pseudo-group 4 element thorium have proved a non-actinide behavior for <b>rutherfordium.</b> A comparison with its lighter homologues placed <b>rutherfordium</b> firmly in group 4 and indicated the formation of a hexachlororutherfordate complex in chloride solutions, {{in a manner similar to}} hafnium and zirconium.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{predictions}} of the chemical properties of <b>rutherfordium</b> were based on calculations which indicated that the relativistic effects on the electron shell might be strong enough that the 7p orbitals would have a lower energy level than the 6d orbitals, giving it a valence electron configuration of 6d1 7s2 7p1 or even 7s2 7p2, therefore making the element behave more like lead than hafnium. With better calculation methods and experimental studies of the chemical properties of <b>rutherfordium</b> compounds it could be shown that this does not happen and that <b>rutherfordium</b> instead behaves {{like the rest of}} the group 4 elements.|$|E
5|$|Early work on {{the study}} of the {{chemistry}} of <b>rutherfordium</b> focused on gas thermochromatography and measurement of relative deposition temperature adsorption curves. The initial work was carried out at Dubna in an attempt to reaffirm their discovery of the element. Recent work is more reliable regarding the identification of the parent <b>rutherfordium</b> radioisotopes. The isotope 261mRf has been used for these studies. The experiments relied on the expectation that <b>rutherfordium</b> would begin the new 6d series of elements and should therefore form a volatile tetrachloride due to the tetrahedral nature of the molecule. Rutherfordium(IV) chloride is more volatile than its lighter homologue hafnium(IV) chloride (HfCl4) because its bonds are more covalent.|$|E
5|$|The group 4 {{elements}} {{are not known}} {{to be involved in}} the biological chemistry of any living systems. They are hard refractory metals with low aqueous solubility and low availability to the biosphere. Titanium is one of the few first row d-block transition metals with no known biological role. <b>Rutherfordium's</b> radioactivity would make it toxic to living cells.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of <b>rutherfordium</b> were {{produced}} in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. The priority of the discovery and therefore the naming of the element was disputed between Soviet and American scientists, {{and it was not}} until 1997 that International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) established <b>rutherfordium</b> as the official name for the element.|$|E
5|$|In the {{periodic}} table of the elements, it is a d-block element and {{the second of the}} fourth-row transition elements. It {{is a member of the}} 7th period and belongs to the group 4 elements. Chemistry experiments have confirmed that <b>rutherfordium</b> behaves as the heavier homologue to hafnium in group 4. The chemical properties of <b>rutherfordium</b> are characterized only partly. They compare well with the chemistry of the other group 4 elements, even though some calculations had indicated that the element might show significantly different properties due to relativistic effects.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> is {{expected}} to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.61), similar to its lighter congener hafnium. It should be a very heavy metal with a density of around 23.2g/cm3; in comparison, the densest known element that has had its density measured, osmium, has a density of 22.61g/cm3. This results from rutherfordium's high atomic weight, the lanthanide and actinide contractions, and relativistic effects, although production of enough <b>rutherfordium</b> to measure this quantity would be impractical, and the sample would quickly decay. The atomic radius for <b>rutherfordium</b> {{is expected}} to be around 150pm. Due to the relativistic stabilization of the 7s orbital and destabilization of the 6d orbital, the Rf+ and Rf2+ ions are predicted to give up 6d electrons instead of 7s electrons, which is the opposite of the behavior of its lighter homologues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> is {{the first}} transactinide element and the second member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals. Calculations on its ionization potentials, atomic radius, as well as radii, orbital energies, and ground levels of its ionized states are {{similar to that of}} hafnium and very different from that of lead. Therefore, it was concluded that rutherfordium's basic properties will resemble those of other group 4 elements, below titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. Some of its properties were determined by gas-phase experiments and aqueous chemistry. The oxidation state +4 is the only stable state for the latter two elements and therefore <b>rutherfordium</b> should also exhibit a stable +4 state. In addition, <b>rutherfordium</b> is also expected to be able to form a less stable +3 state. The standard reduction potential of the Rf4+/Rf couple is predicted to be higher than −1.7V.|$|E
5|$|The American {{synthesis}} was independently {{confirmed in}} 1973 and secured {{the identification of}} <b>rutherfordium</b> as the parent by the observation of K-alpha X-rays in the elemental signature of the 257Rf decay product, nobelium-253.|$|E
5|$|The three Group 4 {{elements}} that occur naturally are titanium, zirconium and hafnium. The first {{three members of}} the group share similar properties; all three are hard refractory metals under standard conditions. However, the fourth element <b>rutherfordium</b> (Rf), has been synthesized in the laboratory; none of its isotopes have been found occurring in nature. All isotopes of <b>rutherfordium</b> are radioactive. So far, no experiments in a supercollider have been conducted to synthesize the next member of the group, unpenthexium (Uph, element 156), and it is unlikely that they will be synthesized in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Following the 2014 {{successful}} {{synthesis of}} seaborgium hexacarbonyl, Sg(CO)6, studies {{were conducted with}} the stable transition metals of groups 7 through 9, suggesting that carbonyl formation could be extended to further probe the chemistries of the early 6d transition metals from <b>rutherfordium</b> to meitnerium inclusive.|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} the elements titanium (Ti), zirconium (Zr), hafnium (Hf) and <b>rutherfordium</b> (Rf). This group {{lies in the}} d-block of the periodic table. The group itself has not acquired a trivial name; {{it belongs to the}} broader grouping of the transition metals.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> was {{reportedly}} first detected in 1966 at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded 242Pu with accelerated 22Ne ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl4.|$|E
5|$|In an {{analogous}} manner to zirconium and hafnium, <b>rutherfordium</b> {{is projected to}} form a very stable, refractory oxide, RfO2. It reacts with halogens to form tetrahalides, RfX4, which hydrolyze on contact with water to form oxyhalides RfOX2. The tetrahalides are volatile solids existing as monomeric tetrahedral molecules in the vapor phase.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> has no stable or {{naturally}} occurring isotopes. Several radioactive isotopes have been synthesized in the laboratory, either by fusing two atoms or by observing {{the decay of}} heavier elements. Sixteen different isotopes have been reported with atomic masses from 253 to 270 (with the exceptions of 264 and 269). Most of these decay predominantly through spontaneous fission pathways.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Rf and atomic number 104, named after physicist Ernest Rutherford. As {{a synthetic}} element, {{it is not}} found in nature and can only be created in a laboratory. It is radioactive; the most stable known isotope, 267Rf, has a half-life of approximately 1.3hours.|$|E
5|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> is {{expected}} to have the electron configuration 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table. It should therefore readily form a hydrated Rf4+ ion in strong acid solution and should readily form complexes in hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic or hydrofluoric acid solutions.|$|E
5|$|The Russian {{scientists}} {{proposed the}} name kurchatovium and the American scientists suggested the name <b>rutherfordium</b> {{for the new}} element. In 1992, the IUPAC/IUPAP Transfermium Working Group (TWG) assessed the claims of discovery and concluded that both teams provided contemporaneous evidence to the synthesis of element 104 and that credit should be shared between the two groups.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{chemistry}} {{has been observed}} only {{for the first three}} members of the group. The chemistry of <b>rutherfordium</b> is not very established and therefore the rest of the section deals only with titanium, zirconium, and hafnium. All the elements of the group are reactive metals with a high melting point (1668°C, 1855°C, 2233°C, 2100°C?). The reactivity is not always obvious due to the rapid formation of a stable oxide layer, which prevents further reactions. The oxides TiO2, ZrO2 and HfO2 are white solids with high melting points and unreactive against most acids.|$|E
5|$|There is {{currently}} {{no use for}} any isotope of berkelium outside basic scientific research. Berkelium-249 is a common target nuclide to prepare still heavier transuranic elements and transactinides, such as lawrencium, <b>rutherfordium</b> and bohrium. It is also useful {{as a source of}} the isotope californium-249, which is used for studies on the chemistry of californium in preference to the more radioactive californium-252 that is produced in neutron bombardment facilities such as the HFIR.|$|E
5|$|Lanthanum and {{actinium}} {{are sometimes}} considered the remaining members of group 3. In their most commonly encountered tripositive ion forms, these elements {{do not possess}} any partially filled f-orbitals, thus continuing the scandium—yttrium—lanthanum—actinium trend, {{in which all the}} elements have relationship similar to that of elements of the calcium—strontium—barium—radium series, the elements' left neighbors in s-block. However, different behavior is observed in other d-block groups, especially in group 4, in which zirconium, hafnium and <b>rutherfordium</b> share similar chemical properties lacking a clear trend. It has however been argued that this is irrelevant because the principle of increasing basicity down the table is more fundamental, and because the behavior of the group 3 elements is more similar to their s-block neighbors than their d-block neighbors.|$|E
5|$|The American group wrote {{a scathing}} {{response}} {{to the findings of}} the TWG, stating that they had given too much emphasis on the results from the Dubna group. In particular they pointed out that the Russian group had altered the details of their claims several times over a period of 20 years, a fact that the Russian team does not deny. They also stressed that the TWG had given too much credence to the chemistry experiments performed by the Russians and accused the TWG of not having appropriately qualified personnel on the committee. The TWG responded by saying that {{this was not the case}} and having assessed each point raised by the American group said that they found no reason to alter their conclusion regarding priority of discovery. The IUPAC finally used the name suggested by the American team (<b>rutherfordium)</b> which may in some way reflect a change of opinion.|$|E
5|$|The name {{seaborgium}} and symbol Sg {{were announced}} at the 207th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in March 1994 by Kenneth Hulet, one of the co-discovers. However, IUPAC resolved in August 1994 that an element could not be named after a living person, and Seaborg was still alive at the time. Thus, in September 1994, IUPAC recommended a set of names in which the names proposed by the three laboratories (the third being the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt, Germany) with competing claims to the discovery for elements 104 to 109 were shifted to various other elements, in which <b>rutherfordium</b> (Rf), the Berkeley proposal for element 104, was shifted to element 106, with seaborgium being dropped entirely as a name.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, IUPAC {{published}} a recommendation on naming the disputed elements following the previous reports. For element 105, they proposed the name joliotium (Jl), after the French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie, a significant {{contributor to the}} development of nuclear physics and chemistry; this name was originally proposed by the Soviet team for element 102, which by then had long been called nobelium. (The name nielsbohrium for element 107 was transformed to bohrium to conform with the practice set by all then-named elements.) This recommendation paper was generally met with criticism from the American scientists: their recommendations were scrambled (the names <b>rutherfordium</b> and hahnium, originally suggested by Berkeley for elements 104 and 105, were used for elements 106 and 108, respectively); both elements 104 and 105 were given names suggested by the Russian team despite earlier recognition of the Berkeley team as of an equal co-discoverer; and especially because the name seaborgium for element 106 was rejected for honoring a living person, a rule that had only just been approved. These names were to be accepted on a Council meeting in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Lawrencium is {{the final}} member of the {{actinide}} series and is sometimes {{considered to be a}} group 3 element, along with scandium, yttrium, and lutetium, as its filled f-shell is expected to make it resemble the 7th-period transition metals. In the periodic table, it is located {{to the right of the}} actinide nobelium, to the left of the 6d transition metal <b>rutherfordium,</b> and under the lanthanide lutetium with which it shares many physical and chemical properties. Lawrencium is expected to be a solid under normal conditions and assume a hexagonal close-packed crystal structure (c/a=1.58), similar to its lighter congener lutetium, though this is not yet known experimentally. The enthalpy of sublimation of lawrencium is estimated to be 352kJ·mol−1, close to the value of lutetium and strongly suggesting that metallic lawrencium is trivalent with the 7s and 6d electrons delocalized, a prediction also supported by a systematic extrapolation of the values of heat of vaporization, bulk modulus, and atomic volume of neighboring elements to lawrencium. Specifically, lawrencium is expected to be a trivalent, silvery metal, easily oxidized by air, steam, and acids, and having an atomic volume similar to that of lutetium and a trivalent metallic radius of 171pm. It is expected to be a rather heavy metal with a density of around 15.6 to 16.6g·cm−3. It is also predicted to have a melting point of around 1900K (1627°C), not far from the value for lutetium (1925K).|$|E
500|$|As a {{consequence}} of the initial competing claims of discovery, an element naming controversy arose. Since the Soviets claimed to have first detected the new element they suggested the name kurchatovium (Ku) in honor of Igor Kurchatov (1903–1960), former head of Soviet nuclear research. This name had been used in books of the Soviet Bloc as the official name of the element. The Americans, however, proposed <b>rutherfordium</b> (Rf) for the new element to honor Ernest Rutherford, who is known as the [...] "father" [...] of nuclear physics. The International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) adopted unnilquadium (Unq) as a temporary, systematic element name, derived from the Latin names for digits 1, 0, and 4. In 1994, IUPAC suggested the name dubnium (Db) to be used since <b>rutherfordium</b> was suggested for element 106 and IUPAC felt that the Dubna team should be rightly recognized for their contributions. However, there was still a dispute over the names of elements 104–107. In 1997 the teams involved resolved the dispute and adopted the current name <b>rutherfordium.</b> The name dubnium was given to element 105 at the same time.|$|E
500|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} confirmed that <b>rutherfordium</b> behaves as a typical member of group 4, forming a tetravalent chloride (RfCl4) and bromide (RfBr4) {{as well as an}} oxychloride (RfOCl2). A decreased volatility was observed for [...] when potassium chloride is provided as the solid phase instead of gas, highly indicative of the formation of nonvolatile [...] mixed salt.|$|E
500|$|In the aqueous phase, the Rf4+ ion hydrolyzes {{less than}} titanium(IV) {{and to a}} similar extent as {{zirconium}} and hafnium, thus resulting in the RfO2+ ion. Treatment of the halides with halide ions promotes the formation of complex ions. The use of chloride and bromide ions produces the hexahalide complexes [...] and [...] For the fluoride complexes, zirconium and hafnium tend to form hepta- and octa- complexes. Thus, for the larger <b>rutherfordium</b> ion, the complexes , [...] and [...] are possible.|$|E
500|$|<b>Rutherfordium</b> was {{reportedly}} first detected in 1964 at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research at Dubna (then in the Soviet Union). Researchers there bombarded a plutonium-242 target with neon-22 ions and separated the reaction products by gradient thermochromatography after conversion to chlorides by interaction with ZrCl4. The team identified spontaneous fission activity contained within a volatile chloride portraying eka-hafnium properties. Although a half-life was not accurately determined, later calculations {{indicated that the}} product was most likely rutherfordium-259 (abbreviated as 259Rf in standard notation): ...|$|E
500|$|In {{presentations of}} the {{periodic}} table, the lanthanides and the actinides are customarily shown as two additional rows below {{the main body}} of the table, with placeholders or else a selected single element of each series (either lanthanum or lutetium, and either actinium or lawrencium, respectively) shown in a single cell of the main table, between barium and hafnium, and radium and <b>rutherfordium,</b> respectively. [...] This convention is entirely a matter of aesthetics and formatting practicality; a rarely used wide-formatted periodic table inserts the lanthanide and actinide series in their proper places, as parts of the table's sixth and seventh rows (periods).|$|E
500|$|In 1996, IUPAC held {{another meeting}} and reconsidered all names {{in hand and}} another set of {{recommendations}} was accepted on this meeting; it was finally approved and published in 1997. Element 105 got its final name, dubnium (Db), after the Russian town of Dubna, {{the location of the}} Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. This decision was [...] "reluctantly" [...] approved by the American scientists. IUPAC stated the Berkeley laboratory had already been recognized several times in the naming of elements (i.e., berkelium, californium, americium) and that the acceptance of the names <b>rutherfordium</b> and seaborgium for elements 104 and 106 should be offset by recognizing the Russian team's contributions to the discovery of elements 104, 105, and 106. (The matter of naming element 107 was transferred to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters, who recommended the name bohrium to be used.) ...|$|E
500|$|... 1969 {{studies on}} the element showed that {{lawrencium}} reacted with chlorine to form a product that was most likely the trichloride LrCl3. Its volatility {{was found to be}} {{similar to that of the}} chlorides of curium, fermium, and nobelium and much less than that of <b>rutherfordium</b> chloride. In 1970, chemical studies were performed on 1500atoms of the isotope 256Lr, comparing it with divalent (No, Ba, Ra), trivalent (Fm, Cf, Cm, Am, Ac), and tetravalent (Th, Pu) elements. It was found that lawrencium coextracted with the trivalent ions, but the short half-life of the 256Lr isotope precluded a confirmation that it eluted ahead of Md3+ in the elution sequence. Lawrencium occurs as the trivalent Lr3+ ion in aqueous solution and hence its compounds should be similar to those of the other trivalent actinides: for example, lawrencium(III) fluoride (LrF3) and hydroxide (Lr(OH)3) should both be insoluble in water. Due to the actinide contraction, the ionic radius of Lr3+ should be smaller than that of Md3+, and it should elute ahead of Md3+ when ammonium α-hydroxyisobutyrate (ammonium α-HIB) is used as an eluant. Later 1987 experiments on the longer-lived isotope 260Lr confirmed lawrencium's trivalency and that it eluted in roughly the same place as erbium, and found that lawrencium's ionic radius was (88.6±0.3)pm, larger than would be expected from simple extrapolation from periodic trends. Later 1988 experiments with more lawrencium atoms refined this value to (88.1±0.1)pm and calculated an enthalpy of hydration value of −(3685±13)kJ·mol−1. It was also pointed out that the actinide contraction at the end of the actinide series was larger than the analogous lanthanide contraction, with the exception of the last actinide, lawrencium: the cause was speculated to be relativistic effects.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{definitions}} of the term 'refractory metals' list the extraordinarily high melting point as a key requirement for inclusion. By one definition, a melting point above [...] is necessary to qualify. The five elements niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten and rhenium are included in all definitions, while the wider definition, including all elements with a melting point above , includes a varying number of nine additional elements: titanium, vanadium, chromium, zirconium, hafnium, ruthenium, rhodium, osmium and iridium. The artificial elements, being radioactive, are never considered {{to be part of}} the refractory metals, although technetium has a melting point of 2430 K or 2157 °C and <b>rutherfordium</b> is predicted to have melting point of 2400 K or 2100 °C.|$|E
