5|$|Both the Illinois State Bar Association and Chicago Bar Association filed amicus curiae briefs in {{the case}} favoring the law firm's position. The case dealt {{with the concept of}} an advance payment <b>retainer,</b> a fee given to an {{attorney}} for later services to a client. An advance payment <b>retainer</b> became part of an attorney's assets {{as soon as it was}} paid, regardless of subsequent events. More common types of <b>retainer</b> defined by the court included the classic <b>retainer</b> (also known as a true <b>retainer)</b> and the security <b>retainer.</b> A classic <b>retainer</b> was described by the court as one used in an attorney-client relationship for a set length of time or a particular purpose. A security <b>retainer</b> referred to a deposit kept in a trust account by the attorney, distinct from their own assets. The case was the first recognition of advance payment retainers in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|When Dowling's {{attorneys}} {{learned about}} the <b>retainer</b> to DLA Piper they {{asked the court to}} order the return of the <b>retainer</b> to the plaintiff, and the circuit court ruled in favor of Dowling. On appeal, the decision was upheld. The Illinois Supreme Court reversed the circuit-court decision, ruling that the <b>retainer</b> was the property of DLA Piper and not Dowling.|$|E
5|$|A host treated his {{retainers}} {{very well}} and showered them with luxury gifts {{if he wanted to}} boast his wealth and status. One <b>retainer</b> even received a sword scabbard decorated with jade and pearls, while others were given items like shoes decorated with pearls. However, not all retainers shared the same status, as those showered with gifts often provided highly skilled work or greater services; retainers who were not as skilled were given lesser gifts and seated in less honorable positions when meeting the host. Regardless of status, any <b>retainer</b> was allowed to come and go from his host's residence as he or she pleased, unlike a slave who was the property of his master and permanently attached to the estate. There was no official government policy {{on how to deal with}} retainers, but when they broke laws they were arrested, and when their master broke the law, sometimes the retainers were detained alongside him.|$|E

30|$|The {{results of}} this study showed that when the fiber-reinforced {{composite}} <b>retainers</b> and spiral wire <b>retainers</b> were compared, less detrimental side effects were observed after 6 months in the spiral wire <b>retainers.</b> From the radiographic viewpoint, the effect of the <b>retainers</b> on the health of the periodontium was statistically insignificant and inconclusive.|$|R
5|$|After mating, sheep have a {{gestation}} period of around five months. Within {{a few days}} of the impending birth, ewes begin to behave differently. They may lie down and stand erratically, paw the ground, or otherwise act out of sync with normal flock patterns. A ewe's udder will quickly fill out, and her vulva will swell. Vaginal, uterine or anal prolapse may also occur, in which case either stitching or a physical <b>retainer</b> can be used to hold the orifice in if the problem persists.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, stock {{abutments}} {{are used}} to retain dentures using a male-adapter attached to the implant and a female adapter in the denture. Two common types of adapters are the ball-and-socket style <b>retainer</b> and the button-style adapter. These types of stock abutments allow movement of the denture, but enough retention {{to improve the quality}} of life for denture wearers, compared to conventional dentures. Regardless of the type of adapter, the female portion of the adapter that is housed in the denture will require periodic replacement, however the number and adapter type does not seem to affect patient satisfaction with the prosthetic for various removable alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Described as a {{large and}} {{physically}} imposing character {{with a reputation for}} womanising, Le Gris was a liege man (feudal <b>retainer)</b> of Count Pierre d'Alençon and a favourite at his court, governing a large swathe of his liege lord's territory in addition to his own ancestral holdings. Le Gris' insistence on defending his case by chivalric trial by combat rather than opting for the safer church trial (to which as a cleric in minor orders he was entitled) attracted widespread support for his cause amongst the French nobility, and controversy continues to this day as to where the real guilt lies in the case.|$|E
30|$|In the {{in vitro}} study by Foek et al.[22], the bond {{strengths}} of {{the different types of}} fixed <b>retainers</b> bonded to the mandibular teeth were evaluated.

The objective {{of this article is to}} explain the benefit of labial fixed <b>retainers</b> over lingual or palatal <b>retainers.</b> Labial fixed <b>retainers</b> have many advantages over lingual or palatal <b>retainers</b> and using them in daily routine practice would benefit the orthodontist as well as the patient in many ways...|$|R
50|$|<b>Retainers</b> can be {{removable}} or fixed. The {{four types}} of <b>retainers</b> typically prescribed by orthodontists and dentists are Hawley, Essix, Zendura, and Bonded (Fixed) <b>retainers.</b> A review of {{the evidence suggests that}} removable <b>retainers</b> are only required to be worn part-time (at night) and that overall there is still insufficient evidence to recommend one type of retention procedure over another.|$|R
5|$|Ernuszt and {{his younger}} brother, John Ernuszt, made several {{attempts}} to regain the estates that Matthias Corvinus had confiscated from their father in the early 1470s. They persuaded him to give them their father's former copper mines at Besztercebánya (now Banská Bystrica in Slovakia) in 1494. Soon after, they leased the mines to John and George Thurzó for 10 years. They also regained Szklabonya (Sklabiná in Slovakia) from Anton Poki, a <b>retainer</b> of John Corvinus. The Ernuszt brothers, who held more than 3,500 peasant households, were among the wealthiest landowners in Hungary in 1494.|$|E
5|$|In 1856 Sakakibara was {{appointed}} {{as a professor}} at the , a shogunate-sponsored military academy. He received this post through the auspices of his teacher Otani, who had himself been granted a teaching position there. In this role, Sakakibara was noticed by the shogun Tokugawa Iemochi, who appointed Sakakibara as his bodyguard and fencing instructor. He also married Taka, the daughter of the shogun's personal <b>retainer</b> Iwajiro Mihashi. In order that his headmastery of the Jikishinkage ryu would not interfere with his duties to the shogun, his student Matsuoka Katsunosuke was temporarily placed in charge of the school.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Kenyatta {{moved to}} Narok, {{where he was}} {{involved}} in transporting livestock to Nairobi, possibly as an administrative clerk or a ranching hand. After the British Army conquered German East Africa, Kenyatta relocated to Nairobi where he worked in a store selling farming and engineering equipment. In the evenings, he took classes in a Church Mission School. Several months later he returned to Thika to work with another company, and then gained employment constructing houses for the Thogota Mission. He also lived for a time in Dagoretti, where he became a <b>retainer</b> for a local sub-chief, Kioi; in 1919 he assisted Kioi in putting the latter's case in a land dispute before a Nairobi court.|$|E
30|$|In {{the view}} of the {{widespread}} acceptance of indefinite retention, it is important {{to determine the effects of}} fixed and removable orthodontic <b>retainers</b> on periodontal health, survival and failure rates of <b>retainers,</b> cost-effectiveness, and impact of orthodontic <b>retainers</b> on patient-reported outcomes.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the {{periodontal}} health of the lower anterior teeth retained with the use of removable and fixed <b>retainers.</b> Fifty four cases receiving comprehensive orthodontic treatment in between 10 to 30 years were randomly selected and divided into 2 groups of 27 each. One group was given removable <b>retainers</b> and other was given fixed <b>retainers.</b> The periodontal status of the patients was accessed with bleeding on probing index, Plaque index and Calculus index. The mean plaque index in case of removable <b>retainers</b> at 1 st, 3 rd and 6 th month were 0. 5, 1. 0 and 1. 7 where as in case of fixed <b>retainers</b> that were 1. 8, 3. 0 and 4. 5. The mean dental calculus index in case of removable <b>retainers</b> at 1 st, 3 rd and 6 th month were 0. 0, 0. 1 and 0. 1 where as in case of fixed <b>retainers</b> that were 0. 1, 0. 9 and 1. 8. In conclusion, removable <b>retainers</b> are superior in oral hygiene maintenance, yet the use of fixed <b>retainers</b> cannot be denied. </p...|$|R

In Dowling v Chicago Options Associates, Inc, the Illinois Supreme Court ruled that preemptive retainers used by attorneys were acceptable arrangements with clients.|$|E
5|$|Iwane Matsui {{was born}} in Nagoya on July 27, 1878. He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former <b>retainer</b> to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After {{completing}} elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts {{and did not want}} to burden him financially. Though he was a short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E
5|$|Some of Henry Tudor's ships {{ran into}} a storm and were forced to return to Brittany or Normandy, while Henry himself {{anchored}} off Plymouth for a week before learning of Buckingham's failure. Buckingham's army was troubled by the same storm and deserted when Richard's forces came against them. Buckingham tried to escape in disguise, but was either turned in by a <b>retainer</b> for the bounty Richard had put on his head, or was discovered in hiding with him. He was convicted of treason and beheaded in Salisbury, near the Bull's Head Inn, on 2 November. His widow, Catherine Woodville, later married Jasper Tudor, the uncle of Henry Tudor, {{who was in the}} process of organising another rebellion.|$|E

30|$|Even {{though the}} effect of {{different}} orthodontic fixed <b>retainers</b> on periodontal status has been studied in previous investigations [13],[15],[24],[28], to our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the fiber-reinforced composite fixed <b>retainers</b> or the radiographic changes in the diameter of periodontium following the placement of fixed <b>retainers</b> from a radiographic viewpoint. Therefore, the aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate and compare the clinical and radiographic effects of two most commonly used fixed <b>retainers</b> on periodontal health.|$|R
50|$|<b>Retainers</b> {{were usually}} {{not asked to}} perform {{domestic}} or productive work in the pre-Qin through early Han periods, but {{from the end of}} the early Han the <b>retainers</b> participated in production, particularly in the cultivation of land, and this tendency was more dominant at the end of Later Han and Three Kingdoms (220-280 CE) periods. During this time, <b>retainers</b> were treated in the same manner as slaves, and slaves and <b>retainers</b> were expected to perform the same kind of menial work.|$|R
5|$|Stafford {{received}} further favour {{from the}} Crown soon after, being granted the wardship {{of the son}} and heir of John Tuchet, 4th Baron Audley, and, when that was taken back in 1409, he received estates in Shropshire and Cambridgeshire in compensation. Unusually ("striking", says Helen Castor) {{he was not a}} <b>retainer</b> of the crown or the Duchy of Lancaster, in Staffordshire, but rather of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham, for whom Humphrey represented the interests of the main Stafford family.|$|E

After their meeting, Borromeo wrote a spiritual instruction to him. In Milan, Andrew also met Giovanni Botero who described him as an actual representative of anti-Machiavellianism. A Protestant <b>retainer</b> of Andrew, Ferenc Forgách, converted to Catholicism in the Basilica della Santa Casa in Loreto on 21 November.|$|E
5|$|The {{family name}} of Harclay derives from Hartley in Westmorland. Though {{relatively}} {{little is known}} about his early years, Andrew Harclay was probably the eldest son of Sir Michael Harclay and Joan, daughter of the Yorkshire landowner William Fitzjohn. His younger brother was the theologian Henry Harclay, a Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Michael Harclay was a <b>retainer</b> of the Clifford family, and served as sheriff of Cumberland from 1285 to 1296. The first documented appearance of Andrew Harclay was at a Westmorland eyre in 1292, at which point it must be assumed that he was at least twenty-one years old, and therefore born in the early 1270s.|$|E
5|$|<b>Retainers</b> {{formed a}} large portion of the {{fighting}} forces amassed by the future Emperor Guangwu (r. 2557 CE) during the civil war against Wang Mang's failing regime. The military role of <b>retainers</b> became much more pronounced by the late 2nd century CE during the political turmoil that would eventually split the empire into three competing states. By then, hosts began to treat <b>retainers</b> as their personal troops (buqu 部曲), which undercut the freedoms of mobility and independence that earlier <b>retainers</b> had enjoyed. Whereas individual <b>retainers</b> had earlier joined a host by their own personal decision, by the late 2nd century CE the lives of the retainers' entire families became heavily controlled by the host.|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} {{cost-effectiveness}} (Table  5), vacuum-formed <b>retainers</b> {{were found to}} be significantly more cost-effective than Hawley <b>retainers</b> within the National Health Service over a 6 -month retention period [12].

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare bond failure and {{breakage}} rates of two types of bonded lingual orthodontic <b>retainers</b> (GFR and. 0175 " multistranded stainless steel wire [MST]) after a 6 -year retention period. Subjects and methods: Eighty-five young adults were randomly divided into two groups: 40 subjects received 48 GFR <b>retainers</b> (14 maxillary and 34 mandibular <b>retainers),</b> and 45 subjects received 50 MST <b>retainers</b> (18 maxillary and 32 mandibular <b>retainers).</b> A Fisher's exact test was performed in order to identify significant differences in the percentage of detachment and breakage of the <b>retainers</b> between the groups. Results: The maxillary detachment rates were 21. 42 % for the GFR group and 22. 22 % for the MST group; the mandibular detachment rates were 11. 76 % for the GFR group and 15. 62 % for the MST group. The maxillary breakage rates were 7. 14 % for the GFR group and 16. 66 % for the MST group; the mandibular breakage rates were 8. 82 % for the GFR group and 15. 62 % for the MST group. The differences were not statistically significant. Conclusion: GFR and multistranded stainless steel <b>retainers</b> showed similar results in terms of bond failure and breakage after 6 years of retention. The use of GFR <b>retainers</b> as a retention strategy should not be discouraged and could be considered a viable esthetic alternative to stainless steel wire <b>retainers.</b> © 2011 CEO...|$|R
5|$|After the Norman {{invasion}} of 1066, Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux {{and the new}} Earl of Kent, probably acquired the manor, which had by this time been lost by its former owners in Canterbury. The burh appears to have continued in use, either because the manor continued to be managed {{in the same way}} as before, or because the occupation of the former elite site demonstrated the Normans' power over the local community. Odo's lands and those of the Archbishop of Canterbury bordered each other, and Eynsford fell within an area mainly controlled by Canterbury. The Italian monk Lanfranc became the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1070, and set about attempting to recover the manor, probably finally doing so around 1082, when Odo was arrested by King William. Lanfranc assigned a knight called Ralph, probably a lay <b>retainer</b> from Normandy, to run the estate, and appointed Ralph's son, William de Enysford, to the role on his father's death.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there are}} some {{complications}} which neither Wally nor the experienced Alisandros anticipates. This time, Varrick's CEO Rueben Massey feels {{sure that there is}} nothing wrong with Krayoxx. The drug works as advertised, it has no ill effects and is unjustly maligned; Varrick has first-rate experts with impeccable records willing to so testify. The Varrick CEO flies to Chicago and engages Nadine Karros, the Rogan Rothberg ace litigator, who asks for a $5 million non-refundable <b>retainer</b> and bills at $1,000 per hour - and those who can afford it consider her worth every penny. With Karros' help, Varrick sets a trap for the mass tort lawyers. This time Varrick will only pretend to negotiate – their true aim would be to have a jury completely vindicate Krayoxx and deny any kind of tort.|$|E

With Dreiberg starting to believe some aspects of Rorschach's conspiracy theory, the pair take {{it upon themselves to}} break him out of prison. Manhattan, after looking back on his own personal history, places the fate of his involvement with human affairs in Juspeczyk's hands.
