25|$|Hence, blood {{with high}} carbon dioxide levels is also lower in pH (more acidic). Hemoglobin can bind protons and carbon dioxide, which causes a {{conformational}} {{change in the}} protein and facilitates the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Protons bind at various places on the protein, while carbon dioxide binds at the α-amino group. Carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin and forms carbaminohemoglobin. This decrease in hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by the binding {{of carbon dioxide and}} acid is known as the Bohr effect The Bohr effect favors the T state rather than the R state. (shifts the O2-saturation curve to the right). Conversely, when the carbon dioxide levels in the blood decrease (i.e., in the lung capillaries), carbon dioxide and protons are released from hemoglobin, increasing the oxygen affinity of the protein. A reduction in the total binding capacity of hemoglobin to oxygen (i.e. shifting the curve down, not just to the right) due to reduced pH is called the root effect. This is seen in bony fish.|$|E

[...] The steel body of the Bathysphere was as strong as ever, but the quartz windows had developed minute fractures which would prevent them from withstanding the pressure of the deep sea, and one of the copper bolts for the hatch was found to be damaged due to the explosive decompression after the failed test dive in 1932. [...] In addition to replacing these parts of the Bathysphere, Beebe also had it installed with a new system of valves which could regulate the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> much more precisely than before, and a barometer to show the increase in pressure if oxygen was flowing too quickly.

The importance <b>of</b> the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> these <b>oxygen</b> metabolites by polymorphonuclear leukocytes, is recognized to {{be a key}} event in the function of these cells during infection and inflammation. We have evaluated the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species during the activation of respiratory burst (RB) of PMNs obtained from children with trisomy 21 using chemiluminescence techniques. As chemiluminogenic probes we have employed lucigenin and luminon that are know {{to be sensitive to the}} superoxide anion and the H 2 O 2 -myeloperoxidase-halide system of PMNs, respectively. Activated PMNs from children with trisomy 21 exhibited a low level of superoxide and a reduced activity of H 2 O 2 -myeloperoxidase-halide system compared to the control group. No significant difference in extracellular H 2 O 2 release was observed. It seems likely that alterations in the enzymatic activities of the Cu/Zn-Superoxide dismutase and myeloperoxidase induce imbalance in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species in activated PMNs from children with trisomy 21.

40|$|Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) {{are in the}} {{circulation}} of most patients with pauci-immune necrotizing vasculitis and pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis. The current study demonstrates an effect of these autoantibodies on neutrophil function in vitro. ANCA cause normal human neutrophils to undergo an oxidative burst and degranulate. Both ANCA phenotypes (i. e., cytoplasmic-pattern ANCA and myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA) induce neutrophil activation. ANCA sera and purified immunoglobulins significantly increase the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> reactive <b>oxygen</b> species when compared with controls. ANCA, in a dose-dependent manner, induce the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> primary granule contents. These effects are markedly enhanced by priming neutrophils with tumor necrosis factor. Flow cytometry studies demonstrate the presence of myeloperoxidase {{on the surface of}} neutrophils after cytokine priming, indicating that primed neutrophils have ANCA antigens at their surfaces to interact with ANCA. These observations suggest an in vivo pathogenetic role for ANCA. We propose that, in patients with necrotizing vasculitis, ANCA-induced <b>release</b> <b>of</b> toxic <b>oxygen</b> radicals and noxious granule enzymes from cytokine-primed neutrophils could be mediating vascular inflammation...|$|R

5000|$|... 1,3-BPG {{is formed}} as an {{intermediate}} in glycolysis. BPGM then takes this and converts it to 2,3-BPG, which serves an important function in oxygen transport. 2,3-BPG binds with high affinity to Hemoglobin, causing a conformational change that results in the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen.</b> Local tissues can then pick up the free oxygen. This is also important in the placenta, where fetal and maternal blood come within such close proximity. With the placenta producing 2,3-BPG, {{a large amount of}} oxygen is released from nearby maternal hemoglobin, which can then dissociate and bind with fetal hemoglobin, which has a much lower affinity for 2,3-BPG.|$|E
50|$|Tibetans are phenotypically diverse. Recent {{research}} into the ability of Tibetans' metabolism to function normally in the oxygen-deficient atmosphere above 4400 m shows that, although Tibetans living at high altitudes have no more oxygen in their blood than other people, they have ten times more nitric oxide and double the forearm blood flow of low-altitude dwellers. Tibetans inherited this adaptation thanks to their denisovan admixture. Nitric oxide causes dilation of blood vessels allowing blood to flow more freely to the extremities and aids the <b>release</b> <b>of</b> <b>oxygen</b> to tissues.

50|$|During normal {{metabolism}} {{in humans}} approximately 20% of the 1,3BPG produced {{does not go}} any further in the glycolytic pathway.

Levels of this 1,3BPG will raise in a patients blood when oxygen levels are low as {{this is one of the}} mechanisms of acclimatization.
