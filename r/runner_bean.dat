25|$|By roughly 6000 BC, hunter-gatherers {{living in}} the {{highlands}} and lowlands of Mesoamerica began to develop agricultural practices with early cultivation of squash and chilli. The earliest example of maize dates to c. 4000 BC and comes from Guilá Naquitz, a cave in Oaxaca. Earlier maize samples have been documented at the Los Ladrones cave site in Panama, c. 5500 BC. Slightly thereafter, other crops began to be cultivated by the semi-agrarian communities throughout Mesoamerica. Although maize {{is the most common}} domesticate, the common bean, tepary bean, scarlet <b>runner</b> <b>bean,</b> jicama, tomato and squash all became common cultivates by 3500 BC. At the same time, cotton, yucca and agave were exploited for fibers and textile materials. By 2000 BC, corn was the staple crop in the region and remained so through modern times. The Ramón or Breadnut tree (Brosimum alicastrum) was an occasional substitute for maize in producing flour. Fruit was also important in the daily diet of Mesoamerican cultures. Some of the main ones consumed include avocado, papaya, guava, mamey, zapote, and annona.|$|E

50|$|Salting is the {{preservation}} of food with dry edible salt. It is related to pickling in general and more specifically to brining (preparing food with brine, that is, salty water) and is one form of curing. It {{is one of the}} oldest methods of preserving food, and two historically significant salt-cured foods are salted fish (usually dried and salted cod or salted herring) and salt-cured meat (such as bacon). Vegetables such as <b>runner</b> <b>beans</b> and cabbage are also often preserved in this manner.|$|R
40|$|Both lipase from <b>runner</b> <b>beans</b> and a {{protease}} (pronase) initially cause increased intensity {{dependence of}} the DCPIP Hill reaction of spinach chloroplasts. This is followed {{by an increase in}} the extrapolated zero intensity quantum requirement. Pronase treatment of the chloroplasts causes rapid changes in absorption and ORD spectra, whereas the effect of lipase treatment is much less pronounced. Long treatments of the thylakoids with the lipase and protease cause unique morphological changes within the membrane. These changes are used to assign chemical compositions to some of the structures revealed by freeze-etching...|$|R
5000|$|The three {{commonly}} known types of green beans are: string or snap beans, {{which may be}} round or have a flat pod; stringless or French beans, which lack a tough, fibrous [...] "string" [...] running {{along the length of}} the pod; and <b>runner</b> <b>beans,</b> which belong to a separate species, Phaseolus coccineus. Green beans may have a purple rather than green pod, which changes to green when cooked. Wax beans are P. vulgaris beans that have a yellow or white pod. Wax bean cultivars are commonly grown; the plants are often of the bush form.|$|R
5000|$|The {{common bean}} {{is a highly}} {{variable}} species that {{has a long history}} of cultivation. All wild members of the species have a climbing habit, but many cultivars are classified as [...] "bush beans" [...] or [...] "pole beans", depending on their style of growth. These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, and the wax bean. The other major types of commercially grown bean are the <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus coccineus) and the broad bean (Vicia faba).|$|E
5000|$|The {{rotation}} of the shoot tip during climbing is autonomous and does not (as sometimes imagined) derive from the shoot's following the sun around the sky [...] - [...] the direction of twist does not therefore depend upon {{which side of the}} equator the plant is growing. This is shown by the fact that some bines always twine clockwise, including <b>runner</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus coccineus) and bindweed (Convolvulus species), while others twine anticlockwise, including French bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and climbing honeysuckles (Lonicera species).|$|E

[...] Marinelli as an adult was 1m 62 tall and wore size 38 shoes. He was so thin and sickly-looking as a boy that his mother urged him to play accordion rather than ride a bike. Marinelli nevertheless raced and came to prominence in the Trophées Peugeot. That brought him selection for the 1948 Tour.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The galactolipids monogalactosyldiglyceride and digalactosyldiglyceride {{together}} comprise {{more than}} 77 % of the photosynthetic membrane lipids of higher plant chloroplasts. We have isolated a lipase from the chloroplasts of <b>runner</b> <b>beans</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris) which is highly specific for these galactolipids. This galactolipase promotes the hydrolysis of monogalactosyldiglyceride and digalactosyldiglyceride, {{in the process}} liberating two free fatty acids into the membrane bilayer, leaving the residual galactosyl glyceride group to diffuse into the aqueous bulk phase. Isolated spinach photosynthetic membranes were treated with this enzyme preparation and changes in membrane composition were studied with thin layer chromatography (for lipids), gel electrophoresis (proteins) ...|$|R
500|$|The {{black bean}} aphid [...] can feed {{on a wide}} variety of host plants. Its primary hosts on which the eggs overwinter are shrubs such as the spindle tree (Euonymus europaeus), Viburnum species, or the mock-orange (Philadelphus species). Its {{secondary}} hosts, on which it spends the summer, include a number of crops including [...] sugar beets, spinach, <b>beans,</b> <b>runner</b> <b>beans,</b> celery, potatoes, sunflowers, carrots, artichokes, tobacco, and tomatoes. It colonises more than two hundred different species of cultivated and wild plants. Among the latter, it shows a preference for poppies (Papaver species), burdock (Arctium tomentonum), fat-hen (Chenopodium album), saltbush (Atriplex rosea), chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla), thistles (Cirsium arvense), and docks (Rumex spp.).|$|R
