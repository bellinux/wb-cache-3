40|$|Abstract. Measurement of {{the third}} and fourth Stokes {{parameters}} of microwave thermal emission can be degraded by nonideal radiometer characteristics. Of particular importance is the level of polarization purity and the knowledge of polarization impurity {{on the part of the}} instrument. An explicit relationship is developed between the true Stokes parameters and the measurements, as functions of nonideal polarization characteristics. In principle, knowledge of the characteristics allows the degradation to be removed by a postprocessing calibration procedure. However, errors in the knowledge are possible, resulting from inexact initial testing and/or subsequent drifting of the instrument. The effects of these errors on overall calibration are considered. It is found that there is considerably greater tolerance to the errors when incoherent detection is used (differencing 6458 linear and left- or <b>right-hand</b> <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations),</b> as opposed to coherent detection (direct cross correlation of vertical and horizontal linear polarizations). This is particularly true when cross-polar leakage is imbalanced. The level of nominal polarization purity that is required is also more relaxed in the incoherent case.

40|$|Wireless {{communication}} undergoes {{rapid changes}} in recent years. More {{and more people}} are using modern communication services, thus increasing the need for higher capacity in transmission. One of the methods that is able to meet the demands is the use of multiple antennas at both link ends known as Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system. However, for the space limited MIMO system, it is relatively difficult to accomplish good performance by using conventional antennas. Therefore, to further improve the performance offered by MIMO, Polarization Reconfigurable Antennas (PRAs) can be adopted. The diversity in polarization can be exploited to increase channel capacity. Moreover, the use of PRAs can also provide savings in terms of space and cost by arranging orthogonal polarized together instead of two physically space separation antennas. Here, single and dual port PRAs are proposed. Two techniques are deployed to achieve the PRAs are slits perturbation (switches on the radiating patch) and alteration of the feeding network (switches on the ground plane). Switching mechanism (ideal and PIN diode) is introduced to reconfigure the <b>polarization</b> between left-hand <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations,</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations,</b> or linear polarization, operating at wireless local area network frequency band (2. 4 – 2. 5 GHz). Furthermore, by exploiting the odd and even mode of the coplanar waveguide structure, dual ports PRAs are realized with the ability to produce orthogonal linear <b>polarization</b> (LP) and <b>circular</b> <b>polarization</b> (CP) modes simultaneously. Good measured port polarization isolations (S 21) of - 16. 3 dB and - 19 dB are obtained at the frequency of 2. 45 GHz for configuration A 1 (orthogonal LP) and A 2 (orthogonal CP), respectively. The proposed PRAs are tested in 2 x 2 MIMO indoor environments to validate their performances by using scalar power correlation method when applied as receiver in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Channel capacity improvement has been achieved for spatial diversity (92. 9 % for LOS and 185. 9 % for NLOS) and polarization diversity (40. 7 % for LOS and 57. 9 % for NLOS). The proposed antenna is highly potential to be adopted to enhance the performance of the MIMO system, especially in dealing with multipath environment and space limited applications...|$|R
40|$|The basic cube {{satellite}} (CubeSat) is {{a modern}} small satellite that has a standard size of about one liter (the 1 U CubeSat). Three 1 U CubeSats could be stacked to form a 3 U CubeSat. Their low-cost, short development time, and ease of deployment make CubeSats popular for space research, geographical information gathering, and communication applications. An antenna is {{a key part of}} the CubeSat communication subsystem. Traditionally, antennas used on CubeSats are wrapped-up wire dipole antennas, which are deployed after satellite launch. Another antenna type used on CubeSats is the patch antenna. In addition to their low gain and efficiency, deployable dipole antennas may also fail to deploy on satellite launch. On the other hand, a solid patch antenna will compete for space with solar cells when placed on a CubeSat face, interfering with satellite power generation. Slot antennas are promising alternatives to dipole and patch antennas on CubeSats. When excited, a thin slot aperture etched on a conductive sheet (ground plane) is an efficient bidirectional radiator. This open slot antenna can be backed by a reflector or cavity for unidirectional radiation, and solar cells can be placed in spaces on the ground plane not occupied by the slot. The large surface areas of 3 U CubeSats can be exploited for a multifunctional antenna by integrating multiple thin slot radiators, which are backed by a thin cavity on the CubeSat surfaces. Solar cells can then be integrated on the antenna surface. Polarization diversity and frequency diversity improve the overall performance of a communication system. Having a single radiating structure that could provide these diversities is desired. It has been demonstrated that when a probe excites a square cavity with two unequal length crossed-slots, the differential radiation from the two slots combines in the far-field to yield <b>circular</b> <b>polarization.</b> In addition, it has been shown that two equal-length proximal slots, when both fed with a stripline, resonate at a frequency due to their original lengths, and also resonate at a lower frequency due to mutual coupling between the slots, leading to a dual-band operation. The multifunctional antenna designs presented are harmonizations and extensions of these two independent works. In the multifunctional antenna designs presented, multiple slots were etched on a 83 mm x 340 mm two-layer shallow cavity. The slots were laid out on the cavity such when the cavity was excited by a probe at a particular point, the differential radiation from the slots would combine in the far-field to yield Left-Handed <b>Circular</b> <b>Polarization</b> (LHCP). Furthermore, when the cavity was excited by another probe at an opposite point, the slots would produce <b>Right-Handed</b> <b>Circular</b> <b>Polarization</b> (RHCP). In addition, as forethought, these slots were laid out on the cavity such that some slots were close together enough to give Linearly Polarized (LP) dual-band operation when fed with a stripline.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{modification}} of the geometrical optics method, which allows one to properly separate the complex amplitude and the phase of the wave solution. Appling this modification to a smoothly inhomogeneous isotropic medium, we show {{that in the first}} geometrical optics approximation the medium is weakly anisotropic. The refractive index, being dependent on the direction of the wave vector, contains the correction, which is proportional to the Berry geometric phase. Two independent eigenmodes of <b>right-hand</b> and left-hand <b>circular</b> <b>polarizations</b> exist in the medium. Their group velocities and phase velocities differ. The difference in the group velocities results in the shift of the rays of different polarizations (the optical Magnus effect). The difference in the phase velocities causes the increase of Berry phase along with the interference of two modes leading to the familiar Rytov law about the rotation of the polarization plane of a wave. The theory developed suggests that both the optical Magnus effect and the Berry phase are accompanying nonlocal topological effects. In this paper the Hamilton ray equations giving a unified description for both of these phenomena have been derived and also a novel splitting effect for a ray of noncircular polarization has been predicted. Specific examples are also discussed. Comment: 28 pages, 2 figures, accepted for publication in Phys. Rev. ...|$|R
