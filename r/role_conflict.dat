Conflict has been noted to be an indicator of the broader concept of workplace harassment. It relates to other stressors that might co-occur, such as <b>role</b> <b>conflict,</b> role ambiguity, and workload. It also relates to strains such as anxiety, depression, physical symptoms, and low levels of job satisfaction.|$|E

Blazina considers that [...] "the {{fear of the}} feminine helps define what is masculine" [...] (1997). In 1986, James O'Neil et al. theorized that the male fear of the feminine is a core aspect of the male psyche. He developed a 37-question psychometric test, a gender <b>role</b> <b>conflict</b> scale (GRCS), to measure {{the extent to which}} a man is in conflict with traditional masculine role values. This test is built upon the notion of the male fear of the feminine.|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, public {{policies}} often focus on economic values, such as efficiency and financial transparency. Public professionals often resist implementing such policies. We analyse this using {{the concept of}} ‘role conflicts’. We use a novel approach by conceptualizing and measuring <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> on the policy level, thereby linking policy implementation and social psychology research. We construct and test scales for policy-client, policy-professional and organizational- professional <b>role</b> <b>conflicts.</b> Using survey data, we show that policy-professional and policy-client <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> negatively influence the willingness of public professionals to implement policies. In concluding, we conceptualized and measured three <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> that can occur during policy implementation...|$|R

We suggested structural model with two mediating variables, <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> and attitude of workers. The model considered job competency(job knowledge, technological competences, and communication skill) as independent variables which affect on the mediating variables directly and final dependent variable indirectly. The hypotheses tests showed that the job knowledge affected negatively on the <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> as the hypothesis assumed, but technological competences affected positively(reserve direction) on the <b>role</b> <b>conflicts.</b> This finding means that the more he / she has good job skill and technologies, the more does he required to do many things in the organization. The results of path analysis showed that attitude of workers mediated between the <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> and job involvement significantly.

The subjects were 300 mothers of students who are enrolled in junior and senior high school and receiving private education in Seoul and its suburbs. The results were as follows: First, the level of stress from private education was found to be higher than the scale range of the median, whereas the degree of <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> was slightly lower than the scale range of the median. Second, a hierarchical regression analysis was performed by using the expenditure on private education and stress from private education as independent variables and the socio-demographic variables of mothers as the control variables in order to identify their effect on the <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> of the mothers of the junior and senior high school students. The results show that the age of the mother, the household monthly income, the monthly expenditure on private education, and stress from private education were significantly related to the <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> of the mothers. That is, the older the age of the mother, the lower the level of monthly income, the lower the level of the monthly expenditure on private education, and the higher the level of stress from private education, the greater the degree of the <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> of the mother...|$|R

Research purpose: This research sought to test the theory that predicted differences between individuals by designation cohort membership (Mr/Ms, doctoral and professorial designation) {{in order to make}} recommendations for how academic staff could better facilitate their career development. Motivation for the study: This research attempted to identify certain ‘crisis milestones’ that reflect potential <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> that may constrain academic career progression. Research design, approach and method: Academic staff of a large South African university (with over 30 000 students) provided the sampling frame for an empirical study. Using logistic regression, three career markers that reflect different career cohorts – Mr/Ms designation, doctoral designation and professorial designation – were each regressed on a range of biographical and contextual factors derived from the literature and a comparative analysis was performed. Main findings: Findings suggest that these cohorts differ significantly according to: satisfaction with teaching; satisfaction with administration; research self-efficacy; and dependent children.  ‘Crisis milestones’, potentially related to <b>role</b> <b>conflicts,</b> might need to be resolved before career progression to doctoral and professorial designations can occur. Practical/Managerial implications: Knowledge of these ‘crisis milestones’ can be used to help academics to manage <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> and issues. This might remove unnecessary constraints to academic career progression. Contribution/Value add: This study provides new insights into certain ‘crisis milestones’, or role conflicts or issues, that may need to be resolved or balanced before the career progression of academics can typically occur. </span...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until Mar 2018. © 2016. This {{research}} explores {{the dark side}} of value co-creation (VCC) in B 2 B service networks. Whilst VCC is attracting a great deal of academic attention and {{a number of studies have}} highlighted the benefits of VCC, researchers often fail to consider the potentially negative consequences of VCC, especially in the context of business networks. This study explores the negative aspects associated with VCC in advertising service networks and identifies <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> and ambiguity, opportunism and power plays on {{the dark side of}} VCC. Tensions created by <b>role</b> <b>conflicts</b> during VCC interactions are highlighted. Also sharing of responsibilities during VCC can result in managers having a lack of clarity about what is expected of them, leading to role ambiguity and misunderstandings between firms. Managers engaging in VCC display weak-form opportunistic behaviors. These softer forms of opportunism are found to be tolerated and almost expected within long-term relationships. This research suggests that the exertion of power often shapes VCC activities within the advertising service network. Power plays are used as a means to mobilize appropriate resources and to influence network actors to adhere to value co-creation objectives. The presence of <b>role</b> <b>conflicts,</b> <b>role</b> ambiguity, opportunistic behaviors and power plays indicate that there is indeed a dark side to VCC that is currently omitted from existing VCC frameworks. A further contribution of our study is to highlight that a bright-dark dichotomy does not fully describe the complexity of VCC in B 2 B service networks and we show how the dark side may lead to positive outcomes...|$|R
