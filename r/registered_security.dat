2500|$|Companies {{that seek}} growth capital will often {{do so in}} order to finance a {{transformational}} event in their life cycle. [...] These companies {{are likely to be more}} mature than venture capital funded companies, able to generate revenue and operating profits but unable to generate sufficient cash to fund major expansions, acquisitions or other investments. Because of this lack of scale these companies generally can find few alternative conduits to secure capital for growth, so access to growth equity can be critical to pursue necessary facility expansion, sales and marketing initiatives, equipment purchases, and new product development. [...] The primary owner of the company may not be willing to take the financial risk alone. By selling part of the company to private equity, the owner can take out some value and share the risk of growth with partners. Capital can also be used to effect a restructuring of a company's balance sheet, particularly to reduce the amount of leverage (or debt) the company has on its balance sheet. [...] A Private investment in public equity, or PIPEs, refer to a form of growth capital investment made into a publicly traded company. [...] PIPE investments are typically made in the form of a convertible or preferred security that is unregistered for a certain period of time. The Registered Direct, or RD, is another common financing vehicle used for growth capital. [...] A registered direct is similar to a PIPE but is instead sold as a <b>registered</b> <b>security.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{address the}} {{challenge}} to the information security coming {{from the lack of}} algorithmic machinery for managing the security events. We start with a mathematical formulation of the problem for a tabular processor by introducing an appropriate target function. Details of corresponding algorithm can be found by following the provided links. We describe our original software module that implements the algorithm for determining the <b>registered</b> <b>security</b> events. The module is based on the tabular processor certified by the Russian Federal Service for Technical and Export Control. We present a control sample for testing the developed module. The sample has the dimension 30 x 20 and contains 14 choices for threshold values of security events number. The results of the tests comply with the specified boundary conditions and demonstrate a nonlinear dependence of the objective function on the number of <b>registered</b> <b>security</b> events, as well as a nonlinear dependence of the percentage of the detected security event on the total initial number of security events to be registered at the event source. The performance of the module specifically, the central processing unit usage is found acceptable (not exceeding 33 %), which allows one to use the software for typical automated workplaces equipped with appropriate tabular processors. Our approach is universal with respect to the application areas...|$|E
40|$|As {{the scale}} and scope private {{military}} and security companies (PMSCs) are rapidly expanding internationally, the question of their regulation is evermore pressing. Although credible exact figures on {{the activities of the}} companies are not available, there is ample indication that the companies play a central role around the world. In Iraq, a Department of Defense survey estimates that there are some 180. 000 contractors compared to 160. 000 U. S. troops (Singer, 2007 : 2). In Nigeria some 1000 <b>registered</b> <b>security</b> companies constitute the second economic sector in the economy after oil (Abrahamsen and Williams, 2006 a). Moreover, the scope of PMSC activity is steadily expanding. The trend to privatize and outsource a growing range of activities places PMSCs in charge of an ever growing range of formerly military or policing tasks. The predictable consequence is that PMSCs are increasingly visible and controversial. Incidences such as that in the Nisour square Baghdad where Blackwater contractors were involved in an incident leaving 17 dead civilians on 16 th of September 2007 focus attention around the regulatory context of PMSC work. This presentation discusses one aspect of that regulatory context, namely the existing international regulation...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{sought to}} assess the effectiveness of brand awareness strategies that were implemented by Peace Security to enhance brand visibility. The study was motivated by intense competition in the security industry, stagnant market share growth and dominance of a few brands in an industry with over a 1500 <b>registered</b> <b>security</b> companies. Peace security {{has been in the}} security industry {{for more than a decade}} but remained little known compared to late entrants despite various brand awareness strategies in place. The major aims therefore were to ascertain the reasons for enhancing brand visibility at Peace security, the challenges faced in enhancing their brand visibility and determine other reasons besides brand awareness that influence choice of a security brand. The models that underpinned the study included the brand awareness dimension model showing different levels of brand visibility, brand identity prism for creating brand image, touchpoint model, spiral model and brand community theory which shows how customers develop awareness of a brand, understand it, associate with a brand and develop brand loyalty. A descriptive research approach was adopted in which questionnaires and interviews were used to collect both qualitative and quantifiable data. A target population of 96 was used which comprised of Peace security management, employees and clients in which a sample of 35 % was used to ensure timely conclusion of the study and easier handling of information. The findings were presented using tables and analysed using descriptive statistics and content analysis. The findings revealed that the major reasons for enhancing brand visibility at Peace security were to increase market share, influence brand choice and increase marketing communication. They were facing several challenges, the major ones being costs, competition, absence of a branding department and brand loyalty. The major factors found to influence brand choice in the security industry included; price, service quality, legal compliance and track record or experience. The researcher concluded that the brand awareness strategies were not effective given challenges associated with the implementation and that some of their clients complemented the company services with those of its competitors. The researcher recommended that Peace Security Company should continue to enhance brand visibility, invest in their brand by establishing and operationalizing a branding department and strive to provide comprehensive security services through innovation and new security products development...|$|E
