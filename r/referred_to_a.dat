Where a bill is relatively uncontroversial, it is <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> committee of the whole Parliament; in other words, all the MPs attending the sitting form a committee and discuss the bill clause by clause.

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} {{occurring}} between noon and evening. The specific range of time this encompasses varies in one direction: noon is currently defined as a constant 12:00 pm, but when afternoon ends is dependent on when evening begins, {{for which there is}} no standard definition. However, before a period of transition from the twelfth to fourteenth centuries, noon instead referred to 3 pm—possible explanations include shifting times for prayers and midday meals, along which one concept of noon was defined—and so afternoon would have <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> narrower timeframe.|$|E
5|$|Baron Edmond de Sélys Longchamps {{coined the}} name Raphus solitarius for these birds in 1848, as he {{believed}} the accounts <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> species of dodo. When 17th-century paintings of white dodos were discovered by 19th-century naturalists, it was assumed they depicted these birds. Anthonie Cornelis Oudemans suggested that {{the discrepancy between the}} paintings and the old descriptions was that the paintings showed females, and that the species was therefore sexually dimorphic. Some authors also believed the birds described were of a species similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, as it was referred to by the same name, or even that there were white species of both dodo and solitaire on the island.|$|E

5|$|Collector Heinrich Fischer had {{originally}} labeled a partial foot, from the Solnhofen area, {{as belonging to}} Compsognathus longipes. Though this identification was rejected by Wilhelm Barnim Dames in 1884, Friedrich von Huene nevertheless in 1925 provisionally referred the specimen to Compsognathus. However, Ostrom's study of 1978 has disproven this. Jens Zinke in 1998 assigned forty-nine teeth from the Kimmeridgian Guimarota formation of Portugal to the genus. These were not identical to those of C. longipes, having serrations on the front edge, but were because of general similarities in form <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Compsognathus sp.|$|E
5|$|Desha {{gradually}} became more conservative {{after his return}} to the House, consistently resisting expansion of the U.S. Navy. He also opposed Secretary of War James Monroe's request to maintain a standing peacetime army of 20,000 men. Desha argued that a large standing army provided the advocates of a larger federal government with an excuse to increase taxes, and proposed that the standing army should consist of only 6,000 men. A coalition of Federalists and conservative Democratic-Republicans in the House united to adopt Desha's suggestion by a vote of 7565. The version of the bill passed by the Senate, however, required a standing army of 15,000 men. The legislation was <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> conference committee, which ultimately adopted a compromise of 10,000 men.|$|E
5|$|Early games {{did not use}} any on-field {{officials}} but {{disputes between}} the players would be <b>referred</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> committee member. Umpires were introduced {{by the end of}} 1862. Two umpires were used; one from each club. The off-field referee was introduced for the Youdan Cup in 1867 and entered the rulebook by 1871. The umpires would then appeal to the referee on behalf of their team. The concept was later introduced to the FA game and persisted until 1891 when the referee moved onto the pitch and the umpires became linesmen. The umpire's flag was first suggested by Charles Clegg at a Sheffield FA meeting in 1874.|$|E
