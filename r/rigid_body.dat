We present {{a method for}} simulating stable {{interactions between}} fluids and unconstrained <b>rigid</b> <b>bodies.</b> Conventional particle-based methods used a penalty-based approach to resolve collisions between fluids and <b>rigid</b> <b>bodies.</b> However, these methods {{are very sensitive to}} the setting of physical parameters such as spring coefficients, and thus the search for appropriate parameters usually results in a tedious time-consuming task. In this paper, we extend a constraint-based approach, which was originally developed for calculating interactions between <b>rigid</b> <b>bodies</b> only, so that we can simulate collisions between fluids and unconstrained <b>rigid</b> <b>bodies</b> without worrying about the parameter tweaking. Our primary contribution lies in the formulation of such interactions as a linear complementary problem {{in such a way that}} it can be resolved by straightforwardly employing Lemke’s algorithm. Several animation results together with the details of GPU-based implementation are presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach...|$|R

25|$|If the {{principle}} of virtual work for applied forces is used on individual particles of a <b>rigid</b> <b>body,</b> {{the principle}} can be generalized for a rigid body: When a <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> that is in equilibrium is subject to virtual compatible displacements, the total virtual work of all external forces is zero; and conversely, if the total virtual work of all external forces acting on a <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> is zero then the body is in equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|We have {{supposed}} that the <b>rigid</b> <b>body</b> rotates around an arbitrary point.
