Sandra Segal Ikuta, writing for them, criticized her colleague for two errors. Ikuta insisted the department's policy, and California's Public Records Act, mooted any discretionary interpretation of the policy that Duke may have conveyed to Quon, thus denying him a reasonable expectation of privacy. She also reminded Wardlaw that the Supreme Court had several times rejected the test on which she read Wardlaw's opinion relying on, that governments must use the least intrusive method of obtaining information available {{in order to protect}} employees' Fourth Amendment rights, a <b>rule</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> seven other circuits as well.|$|E
2500|$|The Rhodesians {{maintained}} {{the system was}} broadly fair since the 50/15 power share split reflected the relative contributions of white and black communities to the [...] "fisc" [...] (that is, the tax take). Progress to black majority rule was possible within {{the arrangement of the}} 1961 constitution as a result of advances in black wealth and education, although it would have taken some years to achieve. It would have required the black community to patiently accept an extended period of white minority <b>rule</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> an extended period of power sharing. Black politicians in the early 1960s were not minded to accept such an arrangement. In any event, income and property qualifications for the electoral roll had become an anachronism.|$|E
2500|$|The Matsya Purana {{mentions}} that the Andhra dynasty ruled for around 450 years. As the Satavahana rule {{ended in the}} early 3rd century, {{the beginning of their}} rule can be dated to the 3rd century BCE. The Indica of Megasthenes (350 – 290 BCE) mentions a powerful tribe named [...] "Andarae", whose king maintained an army of 100,000 infantry, 2,000 cavalry and 1,000 elephants. If Andarae is identified with the Andhras, this can be considered additional evidence of Satavahana rule starting in the 3rd century BCE. The Brahmanda Purana states that [...] "the four Kanvas will rule the earth for 45 years; then (it) will again go to the Andhras". Based on this statement, the proponents of this theory argue that the Satavahana rule began immediately after the Maurya <b>rule,</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> a Kanva interregnum, and then, a revival of the Satavahana rule. According to one version of the theory Simuka succeeded the Mauryans. A variation of the theory is that Simuka was the person who restored the Satavahana rule by overthrewing the Kanvas; the compiler of the Puranas confused him with the founder of the dynasty.|$|E

They are not understood as prescriptive rules but as norms specific to a context. Therefore, norms change with time and culture, so translation re-visits the same problem over and over again.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{parliamentary}} maneuver, {{which has}} been used in the United States Senate, is the so-called [...] "nuclear option" [...] in which a majority sidesteps the two-thirds vote requirement to suspend the rules by raising a point of order in favor of their favored interpretation of the <b>rules,</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> an appeal in which the interpretation is then imposed by a majority vote.|$|R

40|$|In {{decision-making}} processes related to urban redevelopment, the clarity and the transparency play a primary role. In these contexts, the multi-criteria techniques, despite having a wide application, {{are not always}} adequate to represent and to quantify the quality effects of the urban initiatives, {{as well as to}} compare the alternatives for choosing the best solution, phases in which the logical <b>rules</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the decision-maker are not usually explicited. In the present work, with reference to a multi-criteria model recently developed for the municipality of Rome (Italy) to streamline and make more transparent the definition of urban regeneration projects, a solution to these issues is proposed, {{through the use of a}} fuzzy logic system. Using linguistic variables and expressions of ordinary language, logical <b>rules</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the decision-maker in performing the evaluations have been formalized. The result is a decision-making process clear and easy to understand, with positive effects on the legitimacy of the decisions of the Public Administration. © 2014 Springer International Publishing...|$|R

5000|$|Early Mallawan {{used to be}} a Buddhist site. Later it {{was held}} by Thateras until it was invaded by Sayyed Salar Masood Gazi in 1033 AD. [...] A {{wandering}} saint, Maqdoom Shah, and later his disciple, Misbah-ul-Islam, commonly known as Qazi Bhikari, were appointed qazi of Pargana. In 1765 AD Jesuit missionary and traveller Joseph Tiefenthaler visited and described Mallawan as a small town build of bricks surrounded by many trees. With the advent of British <b>Rule,</b> <b>followed</b> <b>by</b> the annexation of Oudh in 1856, Mallawan was made district headquarter and possessed considerable political importance.
