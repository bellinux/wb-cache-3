5|$|Attachment {{theory was}} {{extended}} to adult romantic <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the late 1980s by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver. Four styles of attachment {{have been identified in}} adults: secure, anxious-preoccupied, dismissive-avoidant and fearful-avoidant. These roughly correspond to infant classifications: secure, insecure-ambivalent, insecure-avoidant and disorganized/disoriented.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson (1860–1948) {{published}} his book On Growth and Form. His description of phyllotaxis and the Fibonacci sequence, the mathematical <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the spiral growth patterns of plants, is classic. He showed that simple equations could describe all the apparently complex spiral growth patterns of animal horns and mollusc shells.|$|E

However, different international marketplaces require different business strategies to foster buyer-seller-relationship. This study examines what contributes to the business <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> the Thai context. Marketing, product, technical, logistics, financial, risk-reduction, informational and strategic benefits were tested as variables to predict buyer-seller <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> Thailand. The study reveals significant differences in factors contributing to <b>relationship</b> among business <b>in</b> the city and country. The results verify that risk-reduction strategy and marketing benefits for partners are strongly recommended as key relationship building strategies with Thai partners...|$|R
5|$|In general, {{speculative}} fiction {{on television}} and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> major speculative fiction franchises have generally been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.|$|E

5|$|The precise {{relationships}} between pterosaurs is still unsettled. Many studies of pterosaur <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> {{the past have}} included limited data and were highly contradictory. However, newer studies using larger data sets are beginning to make things clearer. The cladogram (family tree) below follows a phylogenetic analysis presented by Andres & Myers in 2013.|$|E
5|$|A phylogenetic {{analysis}} of various eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct Suillus species revealed that S.sibiricus forms a well-supported clade with S.americanus and S.umbonatus; these relationships are corroborated by a previous analysis (1996), which used a larger sampling of Suillus species to determine taxonomic <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the genus. Within this clade, S.umbonatus and U.S. S.sibiricus can {{be separated from}} the rest of the group. However, the phylogenetic relationships among the tested isolates determined from different methods of analysis are not always consistent and could not be established with confidence. In general, there is little phylogenetic divergence detected in this clade.|$|E
5|$|According to the backstory {{provided}} by the play, Sycorax, while pregnant with Caliban, was banished {{from her home in}} Algiers to the island on which the play takes place. Memories of Sycorax, who dies several years before the main action of the play begins, define several of the <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the play. Relying on his filial connection to Sycorax, Caliban claims ownership of the island. Prospero constantly reminds Ariel of Sycorax's cruel treatment to maintain the sprite's service.|$|E

5|$|Larissa Lai's novel Salt Fish Girl (2002) depicts lesbian <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> {{the context}} of a dystopian {{corporate}} future. The novel features Asian-Canadian characters in these lesbian relationships, incorporating racial and ethnic identity into a queer understanding of speculative fiction. Salt Fish Girl engages queer ideas in regards to procreation and bodies, as characters are able to give birth without sperm by eating the durian fruit. It was shortlisted for the James Tiptree Jr. award in 2002.|$|E

5|$|Moondram Pirai {{depicts a}} young woman whose mental state regresses {{to that of a}} child {{following}} an accident. Sexuality and the repression of desire are dominant motifs, similar to Balu Mahendra's previous film Moodu Pani (1980). The film also explores the possibility of unresolved sexual tension between the protagonists. Critic K. Jeshi compares Moondram Pirai to other films based on physical and mental disabilities like Sethu... (1999), Pithamagan (2003), Perazhagan (2004), Chandramukhi (2005), Anniyan (2005) and Ghajini (2005). When asked about the reason amnesia was chosen for a disability, Mahendra said the disorder is used as a camouflage and as an excuse to portray <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the film.|$|E
5|$|On September 8, 2010, Mike Portnoy {{announced}} that he would be leaving Dream Theater, citing better <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> other projects, burnout, and his desire for a break as reasons. Elaborating on the situation for MusicRadar, John Petrucci revealed that, originally, Portnoy did not want to leave the band; he only wanted to take a break. Only after the rest of the band rejected his proposal did Portnoy decide to quit.|$|E
5|$|She was {{the only}} child from her parents' {{marriage}} but had several half-brothers and sisters from their new <b>relationships.</b> <b>In</b> her early life, she lived in various Surrey towns, including Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge, Esher and Cobham. Her father wanted her {{to have a good}} education so, despite the family's Protestant religion, sent her to various Catholic convent schools around the county. One was St Maur's Convent School in Weybridge, which she attended with Liza Tarbuck. Ripley did not feel academically challenged there, and later declared the school mediocre.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to make a general {{comparison}} between urban-rural <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> China and that in the developed countries, aiming to draw some experiences based on which future tendencies of urban-rural <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> China could be predicted. Design/methodology/approach – The core analysis of this paper examines how the urban-rural relationship develops especially when urbanization rate reaches a very high level. Through literature review, this paper explores the evolution of urban-rural <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> developed nations by referring to some international cities in different industrial stages. In parallel, it goes through this <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> China from 1949 until now. Findings – This paper shows that future urbanization development in China will be generated largely by rural-urban migration especially the eastern-inclined migration while rural industrialization-lead urbanization would develop at the provincial level. It also points that education and training to the labor force is the crucial issue to future urbanization development in China. Originality/value – The obvious value of this paper is to predict, through a historical review and comparison, urban-rural <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> China when it is approaching to high urbanization level. Literature review finds some experiences in developed countries that will somehow take place in China. It also analyzes the eastern-oriented rural-urban migration, rural industrialization and their influence on urban-rural <b>relationship</b> <b>in</b> China.

The spatial relationships between the applicators, the treatment site and the surrounding healthy tissues within this ‘virtual patient’ are a copy of the <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the actual patient.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They also point out that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of people and information largely characterizes the inter-world <b>relationships</b> <b>in</b> the present day. A majority of breakthroughs and innovation originate in Western Europe and the U.S. and later their effects permeate globally.
