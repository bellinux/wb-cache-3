50|$|Investment {{banks that}} offer this product usually take a riskless {{position}} by hedging the client's {{position with the}} underlying asset. For example, the client may trade a swap - say Vodafone. The bank credits the client with 1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45. The bank pays the return on this investment to the client, but also buys the stock in the same quantity for its own trading book (1,000 Vodafone at GBP1.45). Any equity-leg return paid to or due from the client is offset against <b>realised</b> profit or <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> its own investment in the underlying asset. The bank makes its money through commissions, interest spreads and dividend rake-off (paying the client less of the dividend than it receives itself). It may also use the hedge position stock (1,000 Vodafone in this example) {{as part of a}} funding transaction such as stock lending,repo or as collateral for a loan.|$|R
40|$|On 10 June 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union (‘CJ’) {{delivered}} its {{judgment in}} X AB v. Skatteverket (C- 686 / 13). The CJ held the non-deductibility for Swedish corporate tax purposes of <b>realised</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>losses</b> <b>on</b> shareholdings eligible for relief under the Swedish participation exemption regime {{compatible with the}} fundamental freedoms. The case concerned a Swedish company that held a 45 % shareholding in a UK subsidiary company whose shares were issued in US dollars. Due to a devaluation of the US dollar relative to the Swedish krona, the Swedish shareholder company would be confronted with a foreign exchange loss upon a disposal of its UK shareholding. Such a loss, however, would not be tax-deductible under the applicable Swedish tax rules. The CJ held such a treatment not to infringe the freedom of establishment, amongst others, because the non-deductibility {{would have been in}} place irrespective of whether the shareholding investment involved had been made in a Swedish company or in a company in another EU Member State...|$|R

40|$|Asset price bubbles are {{considered}} to be a major risk to financial stability. In this article, we show that an asset price bubble poses a bigger risk when banks are exposed to it. This is because when the bubble bursts, banks <b>realise</b> <b>losses</b> and this may trigger bank failures and a credit crunch. In contrast, when overvalued assets are held by ordinary savers, the consequences for financial stability are less severe. We show that low bank profitability and a generous financial safety net for banks are important determinants in their decisions to take risks...|$|R

40|$|The {{disposition}} {{effect is}} an investment bias where investors hold stocks at a loss longer than stocks at a gain. This bias is associated with poorer investment performance and exhibited {{to a greater extent}} by investors with less experience and less sophistication. A method of managing susceptibility to the bias is through use of stop losses. Using the trading records of UK stock market individual investors from 2006 to 2009, this paper shows that stop losses used as part of investment decisions are an effective tool for inoculating against the disposition effect. We also show that investors who use stop losses have less experience and that, when not using stop losses, these investors are more reluctant to <b>realise</b> <b>losses</b> than other investors...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This {{study was}} {{designed}} to validate an in vitro model of the Atraumatic Restorative Technique (ART). This model allowed in depth analyses of the migration of apatite forming Sr and F, from a glass-ionomer, Fuji IXGP (GC Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), into partly demineralized dentine. The second objective was to study the effects of the levels of mineral <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> such ionic <b>exchange.</b> METHODS: Artificial lesions were created in thirty third molars, which were divided into three groups based on time of exposure to the demineralizing solution (7, 14 and 21 days). These were restored with Fuji IXGP and left for 21 days. The method of analysis was electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) with wavelength dispersive spectrometry (WDS). This combination can yield both qualitative identification of elements as well as quantitative compositional information, with a minimum detection limit of 0. 01 %. RESULTS: The results indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in the levels of Ca and P from the control and test sides for all three groups of demineralized dentine. The differences in the depth of penetration and the amount of Sr and F between control and test were significant. CONCLUSIONS: The validity of the in vitro model was confirmed. There was migration of both strontium and fluorine to the artificially demineralized dentine in a pattern consistent with remineralization and similar to what was observed in a previous in vivo study.

40|$|In recent years, China has {{experienced}} {{two forms of}} extreme macroeconomic imbalance: an expenditure imbalance {{in the sense of}} very high investment and very low consumption, giving rise to rapid capital accumulation; and an imbalance between expenditure and production, producing external imbalance, i. e. a huge surplus on the current account of the balance of payments. Both imbalances imply a low rate of time discount by both government and society: consumption in the present is forgone in favour of consumption in the future. The paper examines how these imbalances came about and goes on to consider whether they can be sustained and how they might be redressed. There {{is no evidence that the}} rapid capital accumulation has reduced the rate of profit on capital and thus the incentive to invest. However, persistent external imbalance poses a threat to investment if it generates excess liquidity and asset bubbles. The current account surplus rose remarkably in the years 2004 – 07. This was associated with exogenous increases in competiveness and in saving, both attributable to the economic reform policies. On current policies, the surplus is likely to rise again once the world economy recovers from its recession. This poses three sorts of problems, each of which is examined in turn: difficulties for macroeconomic stabilisation policies; risk of capital <b>loss</b> <b>on</b> the foreign <b>exchange</b> holdings; and the threat of retaliation by China’s trading partners.

This paper shows how optimism in the equity market can bring welfare gains at the aggregate level, despite encouraging negative NPV investments at the 8 ̆ 5 rm level. When equity prices a¤ect incentives to invest in R&D, optimism increases ex-ante optimally the aggregate R&D investment and production. While consumers ex-post <b>realise</b> <b>losses</b> from their equity holdings, they receive gains from higher wages. There are potential welfare gains because the equity contract does not internalise the aggregate productivity gains from the new R&D product.

It also examined {{the impact of these}} capital inflows <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate in Nigeria for the period spanning 1986 to 2011. The study employed both granger causality and error correction modelling techniques. The causality estimates showed no causal link between capital inflows (foreign direct investment and foreign portfolio investment) and exchange rate within this period. The long run regression estimate revealed that foreign direct investment had negative effect <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate while portfolio investment had positive impact <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate. However, the magnitude of the impacts was very minute unlike the international oil price which had a strong negative effect <b>on</b> the <b>exchange</b> rate. The result of the short run result was similar to the causality result, indicating that neither foreign direct investment nor foreign portfolio investment had significant impact <b>on</b> <b>exchange</b> rate.

We analyse all trading activity on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TSE) for the five years ending in 1999. Using a dataset that contains all trades (over one billion) and the identity of every trader (nearly four million), we find that in aggregate, investors in Taiwan are about twice as likely to sell a stock if they are holding that stock for a gain rather than a loss. Eighty-four percent of all Taiwanese investors sell winners at a faster rate than losers.
