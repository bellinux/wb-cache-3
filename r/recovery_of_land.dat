It was an institution suited {{to the days of}} chivalry, and may be regarded as the parent of the duel. In England the [...] "appellant" [...] first formulated his charge, which was proclaimed at five successive county courts. If the [...] "appellee" [...] did not appear he was outlawed; if he did he could plead various exemptions; and unless the court upheld them he was obliged to offer battle by throwing down his glove as gage. When an ordinary court ordered the battle, it was fought on foot with staves and leather shields; but when a court of chivalry' ordered it, on horse with spear and sword. If defeated, the appellee was liable to sentence of death by hanging, and an undecided fight still left him liable, though acquitted on the appeal, to trial by indictment; if the appellant yielded, the appellee was free. The right of [...] "wager of battle" [...] was claimed as late as 1818 by a man named Thornton, who had been acquitted at assizes of a charge of murdering a girl named Ashford; her brother brought an [...] "appeal," [...] and the judges upheld Thornton's claim, but the appellant then withdrew.

The 2 ̆ 7 Grain for Green 2 ̆ 7 project tries for ecological recovery of the upper reaches of the Huang-He and the Yangtze River, by prohibition of grazing and transformation of cultivated fields in steep slopes into afforested areas. This project aims at not only ecological recovery but also rural economic development, because improvement of peasant economy is regarded as a key for future sustainability of the forests. The authors used remote sensing analysis to examine the extent of ecological recovery after the onset of the project on the one hand, and conducted intensive field research in Beisongta Village, Ansai Province, Shanxi to investigate the extent of change of traditional land use and subsistence economy on the other hand. The result of remote sensing analysis showed marked <b>recovery</b> <b>of</b> <b>land</b> cover, that indicates the effect of afforestation and the prohibition of grazing.
