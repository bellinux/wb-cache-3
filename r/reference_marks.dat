25|$|The {{graticule}} is {{a grid of}} squares {{that serve}} as <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> for measuring the displayed trace. These markings, whether located directly on the screen or on a removable plastic filter, usually consist of a 1cm grid with closer tick marks (often at 2mm) on the centre vertical and horizontal axis. One expects to see ten major divisions across the screen; the number of vertical major divisions varies. Comparing the grid markings with the waveform permits one to measure both voltage (vertical axis) and time (horizontal axis). Frequency can also be determined by measuring the waveform period and calculating its reciprocal.|$|E
500|$|MacLeod {{explained}} that creating the shape-shifting werewolves {{was not an}} easy task. The wolf work included shooting [...] "plates", or photographic imagery into which CG creations are integrated. Since the book described the wolves as being as big as horses, full-scale aluminum and board wolf cutouts were used as a visual reference for both actors and crew members. Once the actors had a reference, the cutouts would be removed allowing the cameras to capture the scene. In order for the CG wolves to be in sync with the live action cameras and actors' movements, the team used match movers, a land surveying tool that recorded the shooting location's topography with <b>reference</b> <b>marks.</b>|$|E

Calvisius commanded five cohorts and {{a small number of}} cavalry, drawn from the legion that had garrisoned Oricum.

2500|$|Fish schools swim in disciplined phalanxes, {{with some}} species, such as herrings, able to stream {{up and down}} at {{impressive}} speeds, twisting this way and that, and making startling changes {{in the shape of}} the school, without collisions. It is as if their motions are choreographed, though they are not. There must be very fast response systems to allow the fish to do this. Young fish practice schooling techniques in pairs, and then in larger groups as their techniques and senses mature. The schooling behaviour develops instinctively and is not learnt from older fish. To school the way they do, fish require sensory systems which can respond with great speed to small changes in their position relative to their neighbour. Most schools lose their schooling abilities after dark, and just shoal. This indicates that vision is important to schooling. The importance of vision is also indicated by the behaviour of fish who have been temporarily blinded. Schooling species have eyes on the sides of their heads, which means they can easily see their neighbours. Also, schooling species often have [...] "schooling marks" [...] on their shoulders or the base of their tails, or visually prominent stripes, which provide <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> when schooling, similar in function to passive markers in artificial motion capture. However fish without these markers will still engage in schooling behaviour, though perhaps not as efficiently.|$|E
50|$|Traversing is {{a common}} method of {{surveying}} smaller areas. The surveyor starts from an old reference mark or known position and places a network of <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> covering the survey area. They then measure bearings and distances between the <b>reference</b> <b>marks,</b> and to the target features. Most traverses form a loop pattern or link between two prior <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> so the surveyor can check their measurements.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examined}} temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> in texts written by Dutch deaf {{children and adults}} who differed in sign language proficiency. The temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> systems in Dutch and Sign Language of the Netherlands (SLN) differ substantially, with Dutch having {{a wide range of}} lexical and morphological markers of temporal reference, and SLN relying on lexical <b>marking</b> of temporal <b>reference.</b> The results showed that the youngest proficient signers had difficulties with tense morphology: they avoided the marked past tense form in narratives and omitted verbs, but showed no problems with lexical <b>marking</b> of temporal <b>reference.</b> In the older proficient signing writers, verb morphology emerged, and in proficient signing adults temporal <b>reference</b> <b>marking</b> resembled that of the hearing adults. This study shows that in order to gain more insight into deaf people's writing, it is important to adopt a bilingual perspective and take variations in sign language proficiency into account...|$|R

Disks marked with a triangle are known as [...] "triangulation station disks," [...] since they mark the position of the primary point used for triangulation (or map-making). Disks marked with an arrow are called <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (RMs), since they point (or [...] "refer") to the principal station that may be located many feet away.

A triangulation station was often surrounded by several (usually three) <b>reference</b> <b>marks</b> (see second photo at left), each of which bore an arrow that pointed back towards the main station.

PROQUALI seeks the continuous improvement of the processes and procedures in the installment of services, and the satisfaction of the needs of the customers. It bases its performance on three kinds of concepts, which can improve the quality: Focus on client (listening), continuous learning process of improvement (communication and training/motivation) and changing management (planning, and evaluation) (Ceara, 1998).
