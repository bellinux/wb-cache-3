5|$|Remote {{observation}} of electrons requires detection of their <b>radiated</b> <b>energy.</b> For example, in high-energy environments {{such as the}} corona of a star, free electrons form a plasma that radiates energy due to Bremsstrahlung radiation. Electron gas can undergo plasma oscillation, which is waves caused by synchronized variations in electron density, and these produce energy emissions that can be detected by using radio telescopes.|$|E
5|$|Very {{massive stars}} can undergo core {{collapse}} when nuclear fusion becomes unable {{to sustain the}} core against its own gravity; passing this threshold {{is the cause of}} all types of supernova except Type Ia. The collapse may cause violent expulsion of the outer layers of the star resulting in a supernova, or the release of gravitational potential energy may be insufficient and the star may collapse into a black hole or neutron star with little <b>radiated</b> <b>energy.</b>|$|E
25|$|The main forces {{influencing}} the climate are the glaciation and sea ice. At 81Â° north the archipelago experiences 141 annual days of midnight sun, from 12 April to 30 August. During the winter it experiences 128 days of polar night from 19 October to 23 February. Even during summer {{the angle of}} the sun ray spreads the limited <b>radiated</b> <b>energy</b> over a large area. Further cooling is caused by the high amount of cloudiness. The sea starts to freeze in late September and reaches its annual maximum in March, at which time ninety-five percent of the sea is ice-covered. The ice starts to decrease in May and suffers a major melting in June, with the minimum occurring in August or early September.|$|E

5000|$|Experiments by Ernest Rutherford in 1909 {{showed the}} {{structure}} of the atom to be a dense, positive nucleus with a light, negative charge orbiting around it. This immediately caused problems on how such a system could be stable.

25|$|In addition, {{there exists}} a {{hierarchy}} of stress level in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels. This can easily be understood by considering {{the direction of the}} greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that 'pushes' the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass 'escapes' {{in the direction of the}} least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass up, thus the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the <b>radiated</b> <b>energy,</b> regardless of fault dimensions.|$|E
500|$|Although {{more massive}} stars have more fuel to burn and might {{intuitively}} {{be expected to}} last longer, they also radiate a proportionately greater amount with increased mass. This is required by the stellar equation of state; for a massive star to maintain equilibrium, the outward pressure of <b>radiated</b> <b>energy</b> generated in the core not only must but will rise to match the titanic inward gravitational pressure of its [...] envelope. Thus, the most massive stars may remain on the main sequence {{for only a few}} million years, while stars with less than a tenth of a solar mass may last for over a trillion years.|$|E

In 1934, Adams and American astronomer Theodore Dunham, Jr. found that the amount of oxygen in the atmosphere of Mars was {{less than one percent of}} the amount over a comparable area on Earth.|$|E

Vaughn added that Bacon [...] "had that bravado that Shaw needed", while stating that the actor was his top choice along with Colin Firth. Bacon accepted the role as he was a fan of Vaughn's Kick-Ass, and liked both the character of Shaw and the script, which he described as [...] "a fresh look at the franchise, but also the comic book movies in general". The actor considered that Shaw was a sociopath to whom [...] "the morality of the world did not apply", with producer Simon Kinberg adding that Bacon portrayed him as [...] "somebody, who in his mind, is the hero of the movie". Bacon also said that, [...] "aside from the kind of evil side, I portrayed him as kind of a Hugh Hefner type".

2500|$|The {{second phase}} change {{occurred}} once objects started to condense {{in the early}} universe that were energetic enough to re-ionize neutral hydrogen.

This occurred between 150 million and one billion years after the Big Bang (at a redshift 6<nbsp&znbsp&<nbsp&20). At that time, however, matter had been diffused by the expansion of the universe, and the scattering interactions of photons and electrons were much less frequent than before electron-proton recombination. Thus, a universe full of low density ionized hydrogen will remain transparent, as is the case today.|$|E
