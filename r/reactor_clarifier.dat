40|$|Experiments were {{performed}} on a laboratory model of a hybrid bioreactor consisting of an aeration tank to which support media were added to simulate both suspended and attached growth <b>reactors,</b> a secondary <b>clarifier</b> and a recycling system. The system was operated {{for a period of}} two months, using synthetic wastewater for the substrate medium. Support media were added to the reactor in stages of six nets each stage, so as to evaluate the impact of the addition of the support media on the efficiency of treatment.

40|$|Abstract Aerobic {{granular}} sludge (AGS) {{technology has}} been extensively studied recently to improve sludge settling and behaviour in activated sludge systems. The main advantage is that aerobic granular sludge (AGS) can settle very fast in a <b>reactor</b> or <b>clarifier</b> because AGS is compact and has strong structure. It also has good settleability and a high capacity for biomass retention. Several experimental works have been conducted in this study to observe the settling behaviours of AGS. The study thus has two aims: (1) to compare the settling profile of AGS with other sludge flocs and (2) to observe the influence of mechanical mixing and design of the reactor to the settleability of AGS. The first experimental outcome shows that AGS settles after less than 5 min in a depth of 0. 4 m compared to other sludge flocs (from sequencing batch reactor, conventional activated sludge and extended aeration) which takes more than 30 min. This study also shows that the turbulence from the mixing mechanism and shear in the reactor provides an insignificant effect on the AGS settling velocity.

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} on a full-scale pure oxygen thermophilic plant, operated and monitored throughout a period of 11 years. The plant treats 60, 000 t y(- 1) (year 2013) of high-strength industrial wastewaters deriving mainly from pharmaceuticals and detergents production and landfill leachate. Three different plant configurations were consecutively adopted: (1) biological <b>reactor</b> i final <b>clarifier</b> and sludge recirculation (2002 - 2005); (2) biological reactor + ultrafiltration: membrane biological reactor (MBR) (2006); and (3) MBR + nanofiltration (since 2007). Progressive plant upgrading yielded a performance improvement chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was enhanced by 17 % and 12 % after {{the first and second}} plant modification, respectively. Moreover, COD abatement efficiency exhibited a greater stability, notwithstanding high variability of the influent load. In addition, the following relevant outcomes appeared from the plant monitoring (present configuration) : up to 96 % removal of nitrate and nitrite, due to denitrification; low-specific biomass production (0. 092 kg(VSS) kgCOD(removed) (- 1)), and biological treatability of residual COD under mesophilic conditions (BOD 5 /COD ratio = 0. 25 - 0. 50), thus showing the complementarity of the two biological processes...|$|R
40|$|Odours from {{wastewater}} treatment plants comprise a mixture of various gases, of which hydrogen sulphide (H 2 S) is the main constituent. Microorganisms commonly found in wastewater can degrade sulphurous compounds. Therefore, the use of activated sludge (AS) for odour control offers an alternative to traditional waste gas treatment processes, such as biofilters, bioscrubbers and biotrickling filters, both in practical terms (use of existing facilities) and economically (minimal capital cost). The performance of AS diffusion as a bioscrubber for removing H 2 S at concentrations at 25, 75 and 150 ppmv was evaluated. Pilot-scale trials were undertaken using parallel 60 -L aeration tanks and 20 -L <b>clarifier</b> <b>reactors</b> at the Bedford Sewage Treatment Works, Carington, UK. Olfactometry measurements were also carried out {{to determine whether there}} was any increase in odour concentration owing to H 2 S diffusion. Hydrogen sulphide removal rates of 100 % were obtained, with no noticeable increase in odour concentration throughout the trials as measured by olfactometry. Odour concentration was highest {{at the beginning of the}} trials and lowest during the high H 2 S dosing period, with similar values being obtained for test and control. It was concluded that AS diffusion is an effective bioscrubber for the removal of H 2 S odour...|$|R
40|$|Many {{processes}} in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries generate wastewater containing organic toxic compounds {{and other kinds of}} xenobiotics. Usually, biological treatments are used to degrade a great quantity of these substances. However, most of the time, the microorganisms are not adapted and the treatment can be blocked. Therefore, the first step to make a continuous reactor operative is the acclimation, i. e., the adaptation of the microorganisms to a specific substrate. During this particular step of the process there is a selection and a multiplication of specialized microorganisms and physiological transformations can occur in their metabolic system. Furthermore, combining image processing techniques have already been successfully used to elucidate the activated sludge morphological changes for both aggregated and filamentous bacteria contents, during such processes. The experimental set-up is composed of an aerated <b>reactor</b> and a <b>clarifier.</b> The sludge is recycled from the clarifier by a peristaltic pump. The complete mixing inside the reactor is guaranteed by the diffusion of air from its bottom. The reactor was inoculated with biomass collected from a wastewater treatment plant and fed with an artificial wastewater based on meat extract. During acclimation, chemical parameters were measured in the influent, reactor and effluent, in order to verify the stability of the process. To complete the evaluation of the process, microscopy acquisition and image processing and analysis techniques were performed for aggregates and filamentous bacteria characterization for bright field, Gram and poly-Î²-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) staining images. The information extracted from those images allowed for aggregates and filamentous bacteria contents inspection, identification of PHB storing microorganisms and, gram-positive and gram-negative filamentous bacteria recognition. Figure 1 presents activated sludge samples at the beginning {{and at the end of}} the acclimation phase. It was found in this study that biomass changes during the acclimation phase could be effectively monitored, combining image analysis information and chemical parameters...|$|R
40|$|Nanomaterials {{are being}} {{increasingly}} produced and used across {{a myriad of}} applications while their novel properties {{are still in the}} midst of being designed and explored. Thus the full implications of introducing these materials into the environment cannot be understood, yet the need to assess potential risks is already upon us. This work discusses a comprehensive view of environmental impact with respect to material flows from across the value chain into all compartments of the environment, whereby interactions and potential hazardous effects become possible. A subset of this broad system is then chosen for evaluation; a model is derived to describe the fate of nanomaterials released to wastewater. This analysis considers the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) as a complete mixed <b>reactor</b> aerobic secondary <b>clarifier,</b> and predicts whether nanomaterials will associate with effluent or sludge to project potential concentrations in each. The concentration of nanomaterials reaching a WWTP is estimated based on a linear weighting of total production, and the fate of nanomaterials within the WWTP is based on a characteristic inherent to the material, partition coefficient, and on design parameters of the WWTP, such as retention times and suspended solids concentration. Due to the uncertainty inherent to this problem, a probabilistic approach is employed. Monte Carlo simulation is used, sampling from probability distributions assigned to each of the input parameters to calculate a distribution for the predicted concentrations in sludge and effluent. Input parameter distributions are estimated from values reported in the literature where possible. Where data do not yet exist, studies are carried out to enable parameter estimation. In particular, nanomaterial production is investigated to provide a basis to estimate the magnitude of potential exposure. Nanomaterial partitioning behavior is also studied in this work, through laboratory experiments for several types of nano-silver. The results presented here illustrate the use of nanomaterial inventory data in predicting environmentally relevant concentrations. Estimates of effluent and sludge concentrations for nano-silver with four different types coatings suggest that these surface treatments affect the removal efficiency; the same nanomaterial with different coatings may have different environmental fates. Effluent concentration estimates for C 60 and nano-TiO 2 suggest that these nanomaterials could already be present at problematic concentrations at current levels of annual production. Estimates of environmentally relevant concentrations may aid in interpretation of nanotoxicology studies. These relative estimates are also useful in that they may help inform future decisions regarding where to dedicate resources for future research. Beyond attempting to estimate environmental concentrations of nanomaterials, this type of streamlined model allows the consideration of scenarios, focusing on what happens as various input parameters change. Production quantity and the fraction of this quantity that is released to wastewater are found to greatly influence the model estimates for wastewater effluent concentrations; in the case of wastewater sludge concentrations, the model is sensitive to those parameters in addition to solids retention time.
