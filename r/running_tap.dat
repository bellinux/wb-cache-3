500|$|The title design, {{that was}} awarded Excellence in Title Design at South by Southwest, {{was made by}} Allison and Anthony Brownmoore of Blue Spill {{production}} studio. Kijak's requirement was to [...] "blow people off their seats". According to Anthony Brownmoore, the project was a challenge, since he [...] "was very taken by their [...] look but that can also be quite daunting. To try to make something and be creative with something that's already so mad and so creative". They worked on the title design for months, syncing it to the song [...] "Jade" [...] {{the way that the}} images would pulsate to Yoshiki's drum beats. When creating the background sequences, they used the band's slogan, Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock as an inspiration. They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E

40|$|Classrooms with teachers; clinics with nurses; <b>running</b> <b>taps</b> {{and working}} toilets: for {{millions}} of people across developing countries these things are a distant dream. And yet it is these vital public services – health, education, water and sanitation – that are the key to transforming the lives of people living in poverty...|$|R
2500|$|After {{the first}} article appeared, {{residents}} inundated WASA's water hotline with calls and overwhelmed water testing laboratories with requests to have their tap water tested for lead contamination. District elected officials immediately called for an emergency public meeting, and established an inter-agency task force with the EPA to investigate and manage the problem. [...] However, messages {{to the public at}} the time were often confusing and contradictory: while WASA was suggesting <b>running</b> <b>taps</b> for 90 seconds to flush out any lead, the EPA was demanding that recommendation be changed to ten minutes.|$|R
50|$|Alewerks Brewing Company is a craft brewery in Williamsburg, Virginia, USA. It was {{established}} in 2006 by Chuck Haines {{on the site of}} the old Williamsburg Brewing Company. It is the oldest microbrewery still running in Williamsburg, recently celebrating their 10th anniversary. The brewery utilizes a direct fired brick-clad Peter Austin brew house which distinguishes it from many larger breweries which use a steam based process. The brewery offers tours of the facility and tasting sessions, and talks about the history of beer. Currently, they have 16 <b>running</b> <b>taps</b> in house with 6 core yearly beers, 4 seasonal selections, and 12 Brewmaster Reserve small batch selections distributed in Virginia, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|American politician, LGBT activist, {{and film}} {{producer}} Michael Huffington has mild hyperacusis and underwent sound therapy after finding that <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water caused ear pain.|$|E
5000|$|Hot {{and cold}} water: {{at the start}} of the Victorian era, some houses had <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water and a boiler for hot water. By the turn of the century, hot and cold running water were a common feature.|$|E
50|$|In {{computer}} science {{the situation of}} having a <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> that cannot be, or should not be, turned off is common (such as a stream of audio). Also, computers typically prefer to deal with chunks of data rather than streams. In such situations, double buffering is often employed.|$|E

50|$|None of the {{makeshift}} {{homes in the}} slums have plumbing, <b>running</b> water <b>taps,</b> bathtubs or toilets. Without a built-in bathtub, people of the slums often {{have to look for}} a place to defecate and often end up publicly defecating somewhere in the slum. Among the mountains of garbage and the public defecation, the slum smells of human waste and the garbage dumped into the slum.|$|R
50|$|In {{the spring}} of 1974 when the show was up and <b>running,</b> Bustany <b>tapped</b> Bob Kingsley, who had been program {{director}} at country station KLAC-Los Angeles, to be ACCs producer. Kingsley molded the fledgling program, then heard on 95 stations, into a major success. He abruptly replaced Bowman starting with the May 6, 1978 program, mentioning only on his first show as permanent host that Bowman had left the program to pursue other aspects of his career.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{the people}} living in the council houses on the Priory Estate were rehoused from town centre slum clearances. They were {{generally}} pleased with living in new houses which had gardens, electricity, hot and cold <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water, bathrooms, toilets, a solid fuel boiler, with kitchens and an adjacent pantry.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2006, McGowan {{announced}} {{his plan to}} try again and to leave six taps running for a year at undisclosed locations around London, {{saying that it was}} a continuing protest against private control of water in the UK. A Thames Water spokesman said: [...] "For the sake of the environment we call on Mr McGowan to abandon this childish game now." [...] McGowan later dropped The <b>Running</b> <b>Tap</b> for good.|$|E
50|$|A {{mushroom}} cloth is {{a specially}} selected piece of fabric whose abrasive properties are particularly useful for removing the outer layer (and soil) from edible mushrooms. The mushroom cloth is a generic term for {{any piece of}} clean fabric applied {{to the task of}} cleaning mushrooms. A mushroom cloth is preferred because mushrooms are porous and when cleaned under a <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> they absorb water, which affects their taste when cooked or served raw.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} four stories high. The lowest floor is below ground and {{contains}} what would originally have been servants quarters, which are planned around a central rotunda {{which has a}} central column which originally held some of the few <b>running</b> water <b>taps</b> in the building. Allegedly lady Balfour Blayney brought her coach and horses into this hall instead of stopping outside the front door. Access to the basement is {{by means of the}} servants stairs {{on the north side of}} the house.|$|R
6000|$|... "'But {{the fellow}} is priceless,' the General was saying. 'We could take him round {{to all the}} {{different}} houses and make him fix them all. Hang it, Bishop, I haven't had a decent <b>tap</b> <b>running</b> for two years, and Admiral Hay's pantry has been flooded since last March.' ...|$|R
50|$|The {{cold water}} release method {{involves}} using slow <b>running</b> cold <b>tap</b> water, {{over the edge}} of the pressure cooker lid, being careful to avoid the steam vent or any other valves or outlets and never immersing the pressure cooker under water, otherwise steam can be ejected from under the lid, which could cause scalding injury to the user; also the pressure cooker lid can be permanently damaged by an internal vacuum if water gets sucked into the pressure cooker, since the incoming water blocks the inrush of air.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the above-mentioned innovations, the Technical Department dealt with any number of problems that arose. When the exiled camp authorities cut off the camp's electrical supply, the electricians among the prisoners siphoned electricity from the wires passing overhead just outside the perimeter fence. This too was terminated by the authorities after a few days, and thereafter the prisoners used a modified motor as a generator and even improvised a <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> [...] "hydroelectric station" [...] to supply power to the government headquarters and medical barracks.|$|E
5000|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the process is debatable because electrolysis requires significant amounts of time and power; hence, the amount of hydroxide that could be generated in a fast moving stream of water such as a <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> would be minimal at best. Additionally, the process of reversing the reaction requires much less energy, so if the area between the alkaline and acidic water is at least semi-permeable, the water will undergo another reaction that just leaves neutral water. The second reaction is shown below: ...|$|E
50|$|People in Djougou obtain {{their water}} from several sources. Many homes and places of work have <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water. Other {{concessions}} have a communal well from which people draw their water. There is a lake bordering Djougou {{on the southern}} side, but community members do not fetch water directly from it and access has been recently restricted after the drowning of child playing near the dam in 2009. While people here do not boil their drinking water, they agree that tap water is healthier than well water. The water supply is consistent, and few experience problems with access of some kind.|$|E
50|$|We visited two squats, one {{occupied}} by Roma specializing in scrap metal collection, {{the second one}} by Roma repairing and dealing in cars. The community of scrap metal collectors recently moved into an abandoned fire station on the northside. sic One <b>running</b> water <b>tap</b> serves between 20 and 30 families. About 20 families occupy the premises of a former Ford car-repair dealership. It is a large complex with high ceilings perfectly able to accommodate their caravans and cars. They use a fire hydrant inside the building for getting their water and also built pit latrines outside.|$|R
50|$|Besides the home-run {{businesses}} in the slum, another trade is arising that is becoming more common and more profitable. The illegal exchange of water is increasingly common, especially in Baiganwadi where less than 5% of the population have safe drinking water at their access. Most {{people do not have}} access to clean water, and none of the makeshift homes come with <b>running</b> water <b>taps</b> or basins. The illegal water trade brings water to the residents of the slums for a price. Bags of water are exchanged, though illegally, and a profit is made by selling these bags. This trade is very popular and a necessity because of the high demand and rarity of water in the slum.|$|R
6000|$|... "Business hadn't {{been good}} in the last town, so I only had five dollars. I went to the Fisher Hill {{druggist}} and he credited me for half a gross of eight-ounce bottles and corks. I had the labels and ingredients in my valise, {{left over from the}} last town. Life began to look rosy again after I got in my hotel room with the water <b>running</b> from the <b>tap,</b> and the Resurrection Bitters lining up on the table by the dozen.|$|R
50|$|An aqueous 1 M {{solution}} of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used adjusted to pH 10 with saturated sodium hydroxide solution. The cocoons are immersed in this solution for 72 h at 40 °C and gently stirred. During the process, the cocoons are kept {{under the surface}} of the solution by means of a plastic mesh, using a partial vacuum to encourage penetration of the solution. Afterwards, the cocoons are thoroughly washed with <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water (three times 3 h) and subsequently reeled in tap water at room temperature using the standard method for Bombyx mori. The method described here forms the basis of a patent application.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two ways}} to heat bottles with {{disposable}} inserts or hard plastic, and glass bottles. A bottle can be placed under hot, <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water until the desired temperature is reached. This should take one-to-two minutes. A bottle can be placed in a pan after the water has been heated on a stove. The pan can be removed from the heat and set the bottle in it until it's warm. It is safer to shake milk or formula to even out the temperature. Heating breast milk or infant formula in the microwave is not recommended. This results in [...] "hot spots" [...] that can scald a baby's mouth and throat.|$|E
5000|$|If copper {{is sealed}} to glass, {{it is an}} {{advantage}} to get a thin bright red [...] containing layer between copper and glass. This is done by borating. After W.J. Scott a copper plated tungsten wire is immersed for about 30 s in chromic acid andthen washed thoroughly in <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water. Then it is dipped into a saturated solution of borax and heated to bright red heatin the oxidizing part of a gas flame. Possibly followed by quenching in water and drying. Another method is to oxidize thecopper slightly in a gas flame and then to dip it into borax solution and let it dry. The surface of the boratedcopper is black when hot and turns to dark wine red on cooling.|$|E
5000|$|In 1977, Walker {{described}} the party's membership as being [...] "like a bath with both <b>taps</b> <b>running</b> and the plughole empty. Members pour in and pour out." [...] Fielding echoed this, {{stating that the}} NF's [...] "stable membership" [...] was lower {{than the number of}} people who have [...] "passed through" [...] it. Thurlow noted that even at its peak in the 1970s, the Front's membership was still only half the size of that of the British Union of Fascists during their 1930s heyday.|$|R
50|$|The game {{features}} {{the return of}} Wario's nemesis, Captain Syrup. Early one morning, she {{and a few of}} her soldiers, the Pirate Gooms (Spearmen, which are holdovers from Wario Land; several different levels deal with defeating a giant Spearman), sneak into Wario's Castle and cause havoc. They steal his precious treasure and his beloved pet hen (called Hen), set off his giant alarm clock, and leave the <b>tap</b> <b>running,</b> flooding much of his castle. After Wario wakes up and figures out what's going on, he gives chase across the surrounding lands.|$|R
60|$|A loud yell followed, and {{the whole}} throng hurried off, mad for pillage and destruction. Hugh lingered behind {{for a few moments}} to stimulate himself with more drink, and to set all the <b>taps</b> <b>running,</b> a few of which had accidentally been spared; then, glancing round the despoiled and plundered room, through whose {{shattered}} window the rioters had thrust the Maypole itself,--for even that had been sawn down,--lighted a torch, clapped the mute and motionless John Willet on the back, and waving his light above his head, and uttering a fierce shout, hastened after his companions.|$|R
50|$|Now {{consider}} {{how you would}} do it if you had two buckets. You would fill the first bucket and then swap the second in under the <b>running</b> <b>tap.</b> You then have {{the length of time}} it takes for the second bucket to fill in order to empty the first into the paddling pool. When you return you can simply swap the buckets so that the first is now filling again, during which time you can empty the second into the pool. This can be repeated until the pool is full. It is clear to see that this technique will fill the pool far faster as there is much less time spent waiting, doing nothing, while buckets fill. This is analogous to double buffering. The tap can be on all the time and does not have to wait while the processing is done.|$|E
50|$|In two {{of these}} hand washings, water is poured out over one's hands {{with the aid of}} a vessel, viz., 1) {{whenever}} one wakes from his sleep, and 2) before eating bread. These hand washings are nearly always accompanied with a special blessing prior to concluding the actual act of washing (see infra). Although the minimal quantity of water needed to fulfill one's religious duty is 1/4 of a log (a liquid measure of capacity equal to the bulk or volume of one and half medium-sized eggs), and must be sufficient to cover at least the middle joints of one's fingers, water poured out in excess of this amount is considered praiseworthy in Jewish law. The hand washing made when one leaves the lavatory or latrine, or when one touches his privy parts, or sweat, may be done simply with <b>running</b> <b>tap</b> water (faucet).|$|E
5000|$|McGowan was in {{the news}} in July 2005 for his {{installation}} The <b>Running</b> <b>Tap,</b> a stunt whereby he left the water running in the backroom kitchen of House Gallery in Camberwell. This was done to raise attention {{to the issue of}} water leakage and water wastage. When it began to receive publicity and controversy, McGowan told BBC News: [...] "We are all culpable, we all waste water and that includes Thames Water privatised water company who at the time were considering a hosepipe ban for the public at a time prolonged drought in southern England, whilst simultaneously being accused of massive water wastage, The company itself wasted millions of liters of water through leaks. Mine's art." [...] McGowan said: [...] "Basically it's an art piece for people to come and look at and enjoy aesthetically, it is also a comment on a social and environment issue." [...] His installation used 9,200 imp gal of water a day, and if left on for a full year as he intended, would have wasted [...] of water and cost £11,400. It was turned off several times by protesters of the protest.|$|E

50|$|From the {{documents}} leaked by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden, it became {{well known that}} various governments have been <b>running</b> programs to <b>tap</b> all kinds of communication at massive scales, including email. While the legality of this is still under question, it is certainly clear that the email of citizens with no ties to a terrorist organization have been intercepted and stored. Whistleblower and former National Security Agency (NSA) employee William Binney has reported that the NSA has collected over 20 trillion communications via interception, including many email communications, representing {{one aspect of the}} NSA warrantless surveillance controversy.|$|R
50|$|Other {{termination}} shocks {{can be seen}} in terrestrial systems; {{perhaps the}} easiest may be seen by simply <b>running</b> a water <b>tap</b> into a sink creating a hydraulic jump. Upon hitting the floor of the sink, the flowing water spreads out at a speed that is higher than the local wave speed, forming a disk of shallow, rapidly diverging flow (analogous to the tenuous, supersonic solar wind). Around the periphery of the disk, a shock front or wall of water forms; outside the shock front, the water moves slower than the local wave speed (analogous to the subsonic interstellar medium).|$|R
