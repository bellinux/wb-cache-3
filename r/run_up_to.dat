5|$|The <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1968 presidential {{election}} saw the incumbent president, Lyndon B. Johnson, serving {{during a period}} of great social unrest. There were riots in the major cities despite Johnson's attempts to introduce anti-poverty and anti-discrimination legislation, and there was significant opposition to the ongoing military action in Vietnam.|$|E

The comic was published by DC Comics between February 9 and June 20, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Family {{tensions}} {{play out}} on the highway and at stops along the way, amidst the aging VW van's mechanical problems. When the van breaks down early on, the family learns that they must push the van until it is moving at about 20mph before it is put into gear, at which point they have to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the side door and jump in. Later on, the van's horn starts honking unceasingly by itself.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> UEFA Euro 2008, Baroš had not scored an {{international}} goal since March 2007. He started the Czech Republic's second group game against Portugal, but Portugal won 3–1 and Baroš failed to score. Jan Koller was preferred to Baroš {{in the starting}} lineup for the next match, against Turkey. Despite neither playing in the match nor even being on the pitch, Baroš suffered the indignity of receiving a yellow card during stoppage time {{at the end of the}} match.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{scholars}} thus generally {{attribute the}} numbers {{given in the}} ancient sources to the result of miscalculations or exaggerations {{on the part of}} the victors, or disinformation by the Persians in the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the war. The topic has been hotly debated but the modern consensus revolves around the figure of 300,000500,000. Nevertheless, whatever the real numbers were, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea, and also that much of the army died of starvation and disease, never returning to Asia.|$|E
5|$|Most {{palladium}} is {{used for}} catalytic converters in the automobile industry. In the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> year 2000, the Russian supply of palladium to the global market was repeatedly delayed and disrupted because for political reasons, the export quota was not granted on time. The ensuing market panic drove the price to an all-time high of $1100 per troy ounce in January 2001. Around that time, the Ford Motor Company, fearing that automobile production would be disrupted by a palladium shortage, stockpiled the metal. When prices fell in early 2001, Ford lost nearly US$1billion.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Broadcasting Corporation {{stated that}} it wished to <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> four multichannels at {{different}} times of the day or alternatively offer an HDTV service. It claimed that up to $100 million would be needed to prepare for these services, half of which would need to be government-funded. Other interested parties, such as internet service provider OzEmail argued for the provision of spectrum for interactive services, while Telstra, shareholder in the subscription television provider Foxtel, supported ASTRA's argument for a competitive bidding process for digital spectrum.|$|E

5|$|At the 1920 elections, {{domestic}} interests aligned {{against those}} of the BSAC, rather than unreservedly in favour of responsible government. The <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1922 referendum was long and acrimonious. For the Union were most of the leading citizens of Salisbury and Bulawayo, the British, South African and Rhodesian presses, the BSAC, and the British government. Against them was the Responsible Government Association, founded in 1917 by Ethel Tawse Jollie. Wallis, in his biography of Coghlan, One Man's Hand, gives him {{the credit for the}} victory of the responsible government lobby. Lewis Hastings, reviewing Wallis's book, recalls campaigning with Coghlan and says that he was the undisputed leader of the movement—highly competent, with a clear vision, principled and sincere. He attributes Coghlan's resolve to his years in Kimberley, where he experienced the autocratic rule of the De Beers mining company, owned by the BSAC.|$|E
5|$|Chambers' coach Mike McFarlane {{struggled}} with the workload of full-time training. Frustrated by the distance {{between himself and the}} top sprinters, Chambers decided to relocate to California to work with Ukrainian coach Remi Korchemny and nutritionist Victor Conte. After parting ways with American sprinter Tim Montgomery, Conte looked to Chambers to fill the athlete's berth. In the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the year's major events, Chambers was in fine form and recorded a 200m personal best of 20.27s in Athens on 10 June 2002. Montgomery, impressed by Chambers' training regime, tipped the Briton to win the gold at the forthcoming 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England.|$|E
5|$|From {{the late}} 1990s, the town {{experienced}} severe flooding problems from the Severn and Rea Brook. In {{the autumn of}} 2000 large swathes of the town were underwater, notably Frankwell, which flooded three times in six weeks. The Frankwell flood defences were completed in 2003, along with the new offices of the borough council. More recently, such as in 2005 and 2007, flooding has been less severe, and the defences have generally held back floodwaters from the town centre areas. However, the town car parks are often left to be flooded in the winter, which reduces trade in the town, most evidenced in the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Christmas in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Gannon became {{manager of}} Stockport County, {{now in the}} National League North, {{for the third time}} in his career on 18 January 2016. Gannon started off well, taking the team to the Cheshire Senior Cup final and up to ninth in the table with a {{sequence}} of seven games unbeaten, including five victories, in the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> Easter. County finished eighth in the 2016–17 season, one point outside the play-offs. Gannon was credited with turning around the career of Danny Lloyd, who signed for Peterborough United in May 2017, 12 months after Gannon had persuaded him to play for County rather than quit the game altogether. Gannon said that he was pleased with his defence, but wanted to overhaul the attacking side so as to reach the play-offs the following season.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 1911 Varsity Match, the Poulton–Geen {{partnership}} was {{a constant}} threat to opposition teams. Ten days before the Varsity Match, Oxford beat London Scottish 39–3. Twice Poulton put Geen in the clear, with the latter ending the day with four tries in total. On 12 December, Cambridge were favourites to win but Poulton captained Oxford to victory, {{in front of a}} crowd of 10,000. Geen's form coming into the game was suspect but he proved his worth. However, Poulton suffered a hamstring injury early on and his replacement Eric Thomas, a forward, lacked the speed and skills to combine effectively with Geen. Nevertheless, he came close to scoring, but, as he had done in the previous year's match, he dropped the ball over the tryline. He was to repeat the error the following year.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the {{commissioning}} of the LHC, Walter L. Wagner (an original {{opponent of}} the RHIC), Luis Sancho (a Spanish science writer) and Otto Rössler (a German biochemist) expressed concerns over {{the safety of the}} LHC, and attempted to halt the beginning of the experiments through petitions to the US and European Courts. These opponents assert that the LHC experiments have the potential to create low velocity micro black holes that could grow in mass or release dangerous radiation leading to doomsday scenarios, such as the destruction of the Earth. Other claimed potential risks include the creation of theoretical particles called strangelets, magnetic monopoles and vacuum bubbles.|$|E

5|$|NATO's 2004 Istanbul summit {{was also}} remarkably {{silent on the}} subject of nuclear weapons policy and non-proliferation, as opposed to pre-summit {{diplomacy}} and earlier post-Cold War NATO summits and contrary to the demonstrations going on in Istanbul. In June 2004, shortly before the summit, NATO issued two fact sheets on nuclear policy, portraying the developments within NATO in a favourable light in the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the 2005 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. In practice, no real changes {{since the end of the}} Cold War were implemented, as since the 1994 US Nuclear posture review the number of US nuclear weapons based in Europe remained unchanged, and as Cold War nuclear sharing arrangements dating back to the 1960s remained in force. Additionally, no changes were made to Alliance nuclear policy since the 1999 Strategic Concept.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} history of Greece {{between the end}} of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479–431 BC) is not well supported by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia (πεντηκονταετία, the Fifty Years) by ancient writers, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporaneous, is Thucydides' History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides's account can be, and is, used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.|$|E
5|$|The video {{features}} Beyoncé {{and her two}} companions dancing {{inside an}} infinity cove, which alternates {{between black and white}} and places the focus on the complex choreography. Throughout the video the women click their heels and shake their hips and legs. However, the main intention is to attract the viewers' attention toward their hands and ring fingers as they do the hand-twirl move. At one point during the video, the dancers <b>run</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> a wall, which, according to Frank Gatson Jr., pays homage to Shirley MacLaine's act in the 1969 film Sweet Charity. Toward the end of the video, Beyoncé flashes her own wedding ring on her finger.|$|E
