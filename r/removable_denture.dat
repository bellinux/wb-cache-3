40|$|In making <b>removable</b> <b>denture,</b> {{some aspects}} must be considered: retention, stabilization, support, comfort, and aesthetic. Retention plays an {{important}} role in the success of a <b>removable</b> <b>denture.</b> Retention can be obtained from the undercut area, or friction of the denture’s components to the abutment or abutment. Clasp as a retainer, both of metal casting and wire have been frequently used in the removable partial denture. The clasp has some shortcomings in its using, namely color of the metal can sometimes interfere with the aesthetic of the wearer and cannot be placed on teeth that have experienced extensive caries. Telescopic crown as retainer has several advantages, which can be used on crown of abutment that has experienced extensive caries or tooth that will be an abutment but have endodontic-treated. On telescopic crowns, retention is obtained from the friction between the primary crowns against secondary crown that serves as a retainer.

40|$|Objective To {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} removable dentures and swallowing and describe risks. Methods Twenty-four patients with removable dentures who were referred for videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS) were enrolled. We evaluated the change of swallowing function using VFSS {{before and after the}} removal of the <b>removable</b> <b>denture.</b> The masticatory performance by Kazunori’s method, sensation of oral cavity by Christian’s method, underlying disease, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale for level of consciousness were collected. Functional dysphagia scales, including the oral transit time (OTT), pharyngeal transit time (PTT), percentage of oral residue, percentage of pharyngeal residue, oropharyngeal swallow efficiency (OPSE), and presence of aspiration were measured. Results Four patients dropped out and 20 patients were analyzed (stroke, 13 patients; pneumonia, 3 patients; and others, 4 patients). The mean age was 73. 3 ± 11. 4 years. There were significant differences before and after the removal of the denture for the OTT. OTT was significantly less after the removal of the denture (8. 87 vs. 4. 38 seconds, p= 0. 01). OPSE increased remarkably after the removal of the denture, but without significance (18. 24 %/ sec vs. 25. 26 %/sec, p= 0. 05). The OTT and OPSE, while donning a <b>removable</b> <b>denture,</b> were correlated with the masticatory performance (OTT, p= 0. 04; OPSE, p= 0. 003) and sensation of oral cavity (OTT, p= 0. 006; OPSE, p= 0. 007).

40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{describing}} the masticatory handicap of wearing removable dentures measured by some masticatory tests and the intake of hard and soft foods. Materials and methods: The subjects were {{participants in a}} comprehensive health examination of 67 - 68 -year-old men living in Malmö, Sweden. Four hundred eighty-three men {{took part in a}} clinical oral examination which recorded the number of teeth and removable dentures. One hundred and one had complete dentures in both jaws and 131 had removable partial dentures in different combinations. Masticatory tests used almonds to record the number of strokes to the first swallow, and two-coloured chewing gums for recording bolus kneading and shaping. A nutritionist paid a home visit to assess dietary habits including the consumption of hard and soft foods. The data could be split into groups of different tooth and denture situations which were large enough to enable statistical analysis to be carried out. The results of a regression analysis of the group with different numbers of natural teeth (NT) and no removable dentures {{could be used as a}} reference for correlation with the masticatory capacity of <b>removable</b> <b>denture</b> wearers. Results: Number of strokes to the first swallow revealed no masticatory limitations of wearing removable dentures, while chewing gum colour-mixing and shaping revealed more differentiated impairments equivalent to the function of five to 16 teeth in a remaining natural dentition. Hard food intake for the <b>removable</b> <b>denture</b> groups was comparable to 17 - 19 NT. Soft food intake was not influenced by denture wearing. In a ranking of oral conditions, those with more than 24 NT had the highest test values for all tests, and those with complete sets of dentures the lowest except for the number of strokes to the first swallow of an almond.
