40|$|Background Some {{individuals}} {{may now be}} bypassing their dentists for treatment of bruxism. Self-diagnosed, self-adjusted and self-monitored consumers can access over-the-counter (OTC) bruxism splints via the Internet. While some may regard this market as benefiting consumers there are potential pitfalls {{that need to be}} highlighted. These include unevidenced claims of efficacy. Objective To survey OTC bruxism splints available to individuals in the UK via the Internet, categorise their characteristics, and determine any web-based claims or safety warnings. Materials and methods An Internet search was made of OTC bruxism splints available in the UK. The following information was recorded for each OTC splint: the name of the manufacturer, name of the device, its UK price and any claims and safety warnings made either on a major UK retail website or via other UK web retail outlets. In addition, a note was made of any web-based mention of 'CE marking', indicating compliance with the EC Medical Devices Directive's requirements for safety, quality and performance. Conclusions As with any partial coverage appliance, if worn for protracted periods there may be a risk of unwanted tooth movement. Dentists should report or assist patients with reporting suspected adverse events with OTC splints to the <b>relevant</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authority.</b> In the UK this is the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Results Safety information is notable for its paucity and is totally lacking on many Internet sites. However, manufacturers are not obliged to display safety information on the Internet, but it must be provided with the product. A search of the MAUDE database showed a number of potentially serious adverse events associated with these splints including choking hazards, tissue damage and occlusal changes. None of the splint designs assure full occlusal coverage...|$|E

With the mounting {{establishment of the}} building sub-metering platform, massive amounts of historical power consumption data are provided. In this paper, different building types of six large-scale public buildings in Shanghai are selected, with their sub-metering data deeply analyzed. The concept of CDHs/HDHs (cooling/heating degree hours) is introduced and weekly prediction models of total building power consumption are proposed by the way of multiple linear regression algorithm which is relatively simple and easy to understand. The prediction models are validated to have great accuracy and general applicability in the paper, offering reliable instructions to the building facility manager and <b>relevant</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> in terms of decision making and policy implementation...|$|R

The aim of the present study is to draw information and identify possible gaps on occupational health practices related to seafarers sailing on ships within the European Union Member States (EU MS) with focus on communicable diseases. Methods A structured questionnaire was sent to <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> from 21 EU MS. The questionnaire included questions about occupational health policies, medical certification of seafarers, communicable diseases reporting and relevant legislation. Descriptive analysis of the data was conducted by the use of Epi Info software: EU MS were categorized in four priority groups (A, B, C, D) based on: number of passenger ships visits, volume of passengers, and number of ports in each country. Moreover, EU MS were categorized to old and new, based on the date of entry in the EU. Results All 21 countries with <b>relevant</b> <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> responded to the questionnaire. The existence of specific national legislation/regulation/guidelines related to vaccination of seafarers was reported by three out of the 21 (14 %) responding authorities. Surveillance data of communicable diseases related to seafarers are collected and analyzed by 4 (19 %) authorities. Five out of 21 of the responding countries (24 %) reported that tuberculin test result is required for the issuance of seafarer's medical certificate while a great variety of medical examination is required for the issuance of this certificate among countries. Gaps on occupational health services focused on communicable diseases related to maritime occupation have been reported by 33 % of the responding countries. Responding authorities from Group A and B had the highest percentage of reported gaps followed by groups C and D. Old MS reported a higher frequency regarding gaps on occupational health services in comparison to new MS. Conclusion Our results revealed heterogeneity regarding occupational health of maritime employees in EU MS. This work provides some evidence that further work at international and European level could be considered, in order to explore the potential for harmonized initiatives regarding occupational health of seafarers. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} a state of the art review {{conducted}} so far, make clear the relevance of addressing the socio-economic return of public investment, in particular the support provided by the European Union programmes to R&D projects at national or regional level. However, according to the theoretical and empirical literature survey and, based on the experience and studies made in different countries and institutions, it seems that a formal appraisal of the socio-economic added value of these support programmes is ultimately needed. Besides that, the consultation of <b>relevant</b> experts and <b>competent</b> <b>authorities</b> seems to be an essential element for the evaluation process. This research work aims to present a participatory methodology that may be used to assess the social impact of the R&D programmes and their contribution to the general social welfare. Based on the literature survey and on the empirical analysis, a hierarchical set of attributes and measurable indicators was chosen in order to characterise qualitatively and quantitatively the R&D programme goals and achievements. These indicators were then presented to a group of experts, chosen from companies and national organisms directly involved in public programmes or in charge of projects supported by these programmes. The final output of this research is a proposal of a final ranking, indicating the relative importance of each attribute and of each individual indicator as a measure for the socio-economic added value of an R&D programme...|$|R
