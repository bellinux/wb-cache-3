The {{aim of this}} project is to investigate the use of ferrofluids for tissue retraction during Minimally Access Surgery (MAS). In the in-vivo porcine experiments, 0. 3 ml of ferrofluid (200 mg/ml concentration) containing 10 nm particles is injected subserosally into the small bowel, respectively. A 0. 6 T magnetic field is created {{using a combination of}} 10 mm and 20 mm diameter Neodymium Iron Boron magnets. The vertical <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> is measured up to 80 mm and video-recorded. The results demonstrate the capacity of ferrofluid to facilitate the tissue manipulation and analysis of the migration of the particles within the tissue using micro computed tomography (CT). A theoretical model developed to validate the experimental results is also beneficial for predicting retraction force. In conclusion, this feasibility study provides a protocol for systematically using small volumes of ferrofluid, without the need to mechanically grasp the tissue...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the stability of temporary anchorage devices, rate of bodily canine retraction and anchorage loss using miniscrews as a skeletal anchorage mean. The sample comprised twelve patients (3 males and 9 females, age range 17 - 28 years) who were scheduled for extraction of upper premolars. After leveling and alignment, a pilot drill was used and titanium miniscrews 1. 2 - 1. 3 mm in diameter and 8 mm length were inserted into the buccal cortical bone between the maxillary second premolars and first molars on both sides. Immediate loading of miniscrews and immediate canine retraction after extraction was performed. The canines were retracted with nitinol springs extending from the canine brackets to the mini-implant. Force magnitude was initially 75 gf and increased to 150 gf after 3 weeks. Patients were seen at 3 -week intervals until retraction was considered complete. Stability, gingival index around miniscrews, and patient comfort were rated. <b>Retraction</b> <b>distance</b> evaluated by measurin...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{ability of}} a cell to {{distribute}} contractile stresses across the extracellular matrix in a spatially heterogeneous fashion underlies many cellular behaviors, including motility and tissue assembly. Here we investigate the biophysical basis of this phenomenon by using femtosecond laser nanosurgery to measure the viscoelastic recoil and cell-shape contributions of contractile stress fibers (SFs) located in specific compartments of living cells. Upon photodisruption and recoil, myosin light chain kinase-dependent SFs located along the cell periphery display much lower effective elasticities and higher plateau retraction distances than Rho-associated kinase-dependent SFs located in the cell center, with severing of peripheral fibers uniquely triggering a dramatic contraction of the entire cell within minutes of fiber irradiation. Image correlation spectroscopy reveals that when one population of SFs is pharmacologically dissipated, actin density flows toward the other population. Furthermore, dissipation of peripheral fibers reduces the elasticity and increases the plateau <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> of central fibers, and severing central fibers under these conditions triggers cellular contraction. Together, these findings show that SFs regulated by different myosin activators exhibit different mechanical properties and cell shape contributions. They also suggest that some fibers can absorb components and assume mechanical roles of other fibers to stabilize cell shape...|$|E

40|$|Background: Low-intensity {{laser therapy}} (LILT) can be {{utilized}} for different treatments {{in the field}} of orthodontics and dentofacial orthopedics. The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the efficacy of LILT on (1) the rate of canine movement during canine retraction phase and (2) evaluate the radiographic changes occurring during LILT around the irradiated area. Materials and Methods: A total of 10 patients of both genders were included for this study. One quadrant of the upper arch was considered control group (CG) and received mechanical activation of the canine teeth with 150 g. The opposite quadrant received the same mechanical activation and was also irradiated with a diode emitting light (gallium-arsenide laser) at 904 nm, for 10 s at 12 mW, at 4. 2 J/cm 2. Laser application was done on 1 st day, 3 rd, 7 th, 14 th, 21 th, 28 th, 35 th, 42 nd, 49 th, 56 th day respectively during the canine <b>retraction</b> phase. <b>Distance</b> was measured on 1 st day, 35 th day and 63 rd day and appliance activation was done on 1 st and 35 th day. Results were analyzed using t-test with the significance level set at P < 0. 01. Results: Mean value obtained from 1 st to 63 rd day was 3. 30 ± 2. 36 mm for CG and 3. 53 ± 2. 30 mm for laser group (LG). Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of tooth movement during canine retraction between the LG and the CG. There was no evidence of any pathologic changes in the radiograph following LILT...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the role of extracellular DNA (eDNA) on the adhesion strength of Streptococcus mutans LT 11 on substrata with different hydrophobicities at high and low ionic strengths. AFM adhesion forces to a hydrophilic and hydrophobic substratum increased with increasing surface-delay times and ionic strength and were stronger on a hydrophobic than on a hydrophilic substratum. The presence of eDNA on the streptococcal cell surface enhanced its adhesion force to a hydrophobic substratum significantly more than to a hydrophilic substratum, especially after bond maturation. Bond maturation on a hydrophilic substratum was accompanied by an increasing number of minor adhesion peaks, indicating the involvement of acid base interactions, whereas on the hydrophobic substratum surface the number of minor adhesion peaks remained low. More minor adhesion peaks developed on the hydrophilic substratum at low ionic strength than at high ionic strength. The final rupture <b>distance</b> in <b>retraction</b> force <b>distance</b> curves was independent of ionic strength on a hydrophilic substratum and increased with increasing surface delay time. On the hydrophobic surface, the final rupture distance did not increase with surface delay time but was significantly smaller at low than at high ionic strength. Final rupture distances were different in presence and absence of eDNA, and the lower values of this difference coincided with the decrease in hydrodynamic radius of the streptococci upon increasing ionic strength, measured using dynamic light scattering. AFM also yielded higher values for the ionic strength induced difference in final rupture distance because in AFM rupture is forced, while in dynamic light scattering differences in radius are only induced by ionic strength differences...|$|R

The {{goal of this}} study was to compare the force produced by a stainless-steel segmental T-loop spring without and with heat-treatment on 4500 C for 15 minutes, with various activation distance and gable. The design of the study was in-vitro laboratory experimental design. This study was performed at the Chemistry Laboratory of the Faculty of Science, ITB in 2006. Sample included 50 segmental T-loop springs with α and β angle of 0 °– 0 °, 7. 5 °– 7. 5 °, 15 °– 15 °, and 22. 5 °– 22. 5 °, and 30 °– 30 ° which consisted of 25 springs without heat-treatment and 25 springs with heat-treatment. Force was measured using autograph with a <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> of 1, 2, and 3 mm and the results were gained from ANOVA statistics analysis with a factorial design of 2 x 3 x 5 and 5 replications for each cell and posthoc Student Newman Keuls and Tukey test. The result of the statistic test showed that heat-treatment compared to no heat-treatment and interaction between heat-treatment and gable gives significant effect to the force created (p-value < 0. 05).

40|$|This study {{undertook}} the in vivo {{measurement of}} surface pressures applied by {{the fingers of}} the surgeon during typical representative retraction movements of key human abdominal organs during both open and hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Surface pressures were measured using a flexible thin-film pressure sensor for 35 typical liver retractions to access the gall bladder, 36 bowel retractions, 9 kidney retractions, 8 stomach retractions, and 5 spleen retractions across 12 patients undergoing open and laparoscopic abdominal surgery. The maximum and root mean square surface pressures were calculated for each organ retraction. The maximum surface pressures applied to these key abdominal organs {{are in the range}} 1 to 41 kPa, and the average maximum surface pressure for all organs and procedures was 14 ± 3 kPa. Surface pressure relaxation during the retraction hold period was observed. Generally, the surface pressures are higher, and the rate of surface pressure relaxation is lower, in the more confined hand-assisted laparoscopic procedures than in open surgery. Combined video footage and pressure sensor data for retraction of the liver in open surgery enabled correlation of organ <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> with surface pressure application. The data provide a platform to design strategies for the prevention of retraction injuries. They also form a basis for the design of next-generation organ retraction and space creation surgical devices with embedded sensors that can further quantify intraoperative retraction forces to reduce injury or trauma to organs and surrounding tissues...|$|E
40|$|This study evaluated, over a 4 -month study period, {{the amount}} of apical root {{resorption}} occurring in maxillary central incisors following their retraction when employing either micro-implant or J-hook headgear anchorage. The prospective randomised clinical trial was conducted in Orthodontic Clinic, College of Stomatology, China from 2008 – 2009. Subjects are patients requiring fixed appliances on waiting list (n= 20). In female Han Chinese patients aged from 16 – 26 years, standardized periapical radiographs from 10 randomly assigned patients with maxillary protrusions comprising the micro-implant group, and from 10 similar patients comprising the J-hook headgear group, were assessed for maxillary central incisor apical root resorption. Measurements before and after orthodontic therapy were also obtained from lateral cephalometric radiographs to calculate incisor horizontal retraction and vertical intrusion distances. Estimated retraction force vectors were calculated in horizontal and vertical directions for both treatment groups. Data analysis employed t-tests and the Pearson correlation test, with α= 0. 05 for statistical significance. The results showed that {{when compared with the}} J-hook group, significantly more apical root resorption shortening of the maxillary central incisors was observed in the micro-implant group (1. 27 mm difference, 95 % CI= 0. 70 – 1. 84, P< 0. 001), which was associated with a significantly larger <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> (P= 0. 004) and a smaller vertical force component (P< 0. 0001). We are led to conclude that continuous activation of the nickel-titanium coil springs used in the micro-implant group resulted in significantly more apical root resorption shortening and maxillary central incisor retraction than when intermittent J-hook retraction was employed. The employment of continuous duration orthodontic forces presents a risk for increased apical root resorption that requires careful radiographic monitoring. Qingzhu Wang, Wenjing Chen, Roger J.

40|$|The {{development}} of microneedles that penetrate the skin barrier, but are small {{enough not to}} stimulate nerves, {{has the potential to}} deliver drugs across skin in a painless way. Controlled injection by convective flow into skin using hollow microneedles, however, has remained a challenge. To address this challenge, the goals of this study were (i) to provide experimental measurements coupled with numerical simulations to quantitatively describe fluid mechanics of flow within microneedles over a range of experimental conditions and needle geometries, (ii) to demonstrate and study the effects of diffusion-based delivery of insulin to diabetic rats in vivo using solid and hollow microneedles and (iii) to determine the effect of experimental parameters on microinfusion through hollow microneedles into skin to optimize drug delivery protocols and identify rate-limiting barriers to flow. Experimentally, we quantified the relationship between pressure drop and flow rate through microneedles as a function of fluid viscosity and microneedle length, diameter, and cone half-angle. Microneedle tip diameter and taper angle were the primary controlling parameters for flow through conically tapered microneedles as shown by numerical simulations. Flow rates over a range of 1. 4 56 l/s were achieved through microneedles (in the absence of skin) with pressure drops in the range of 4. 6 196. 5 kPa. This work also studied the use of solid and hollow microneedle arrays to insert into the skin of diabetic animals for transdermal delivery of insulin. Blood glucose levels dropped by as much as 80 % in diabetic rats in vivo. Larger drops in blood glucose level and larger plasma insulin concentrations were shown due to higher donor solution insulin concentration, shorter microneedles insertion time and fewer repeated insertions. The final scope of this work was to determine the effect of microneedle geometry and infusion protocols on microinfusion flow rate into skin in vitro. Infusion flow rates ranged from 21 to 1130 l/h was demonstrated using glass microneedles. The presence of a bevel at the microneedle tip, larger <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> and insertion depth, larger infusion pressure and the presence of hyaluronidase led to larger infusion flow rates.

40|$|The {{single crystal}} {{silicon-on-insulator}} thin film materials system represents both an ideal model {{system for the}} study of anisotropic thin film dewetting as well as a technologically important system {{for the development of the}} next generation of MOSFET devices. The scientific community has misinterpreted the mechanism behind SOI dewetting, attributing it to a stress-driven instability. In this work, we characterize and measure the kinetics and geometry of thermally-activated dewetting in ultra-thin SOI films as a function of SOI thickness, crystallographic patterned-edge orientation, and temperature. Using experimental data and physical reasoning, we strongly argue against the previously existing scientific consensus that SOI dewetting is a stress-driven instability and present a 5 -step isotropic surface-energy-driven dewetting model based upon the capillary film edge instability and the generalized Rayleigh instability, in which we integrate existing theories and in addition develop an expression for the edge <b>retraction</b> <b>distance</b> during the initial uniform edge thickening and retraction phase of dewetting at a patterned mesa edge for the first time, predicting a square root dependence with time and an inverse power dependence on film thickness. In our study, we observe and quantify the kinetics of the initial edge retraction dewetting mechanism experimentally for the first time and confirm the square root time dependence and inverse power law film thickness dependence predicted by our new model. We also quantify the edge dewetting front propagation velocity in SOI and determine that it depends on the negative third power of the film thickness, agreeing with the prediction of Jiran and Thompson and with our model. (cont.) We also extract an activation energy for the edge dewetting front propagation velocity of 2. 9 +- 0. 3 eV, in reasonable agreement with reported values for Si surface diffusion on (111) planes. Furthermore, we present for the first time an anisotropic model for void finger propagation that is able to accurately explain the detailed anisotropic dewetting geometries observed in SOI dewetting. A technique for stabilizing ultra-thin SOI films, dielectric layer edge coverage, is also demonstrated that may prove useful to enable the stabilization of ultra-thin SOI films during fully-depleted SOI transistor fabrication. We also report on the effect of Ge coverage on SOI dewetting kinetics. by David T. Danielson. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|In the {{as-deposited}} state, {{thin films}} are generally far from equilibrium and will agglomerate or dewet to form arrays of islands when sufficient atomic motion is allowed. Dewetting can occur {{well below the}} films' melting temperature in the solid-state. The dewetting process begins by formation and motion of film-substrate-vapor three-phase boundaries. These film edges retract via capillarity-driven mass transport. In the absence of film or substrate patterning, the dewetting morphology of polycrystalline films is not well ordered. However, dewetting in single crystal films leads to a much more regular morphology, due to surface and interfacial energy anisotropy and surface self-diffusivity anisotropy. When dewetting of such films is templated by pre-patterning, dewetting patterns {{much smaller than the}} original template patterns can be generated. This makes templated dewetting a potential self-assembly method for generation of complex structures with sub-lithographic length scales. However, control of such patterns in single crystal films requires a significant degree of quantitative understanding of anisotropic dewetting in the solid-state. As a starting point for quantitative research on solid-state dewetting of single crystal films, dewetting of thin single crystal films that were pre-patterned to have edges with specific in-plane orientations were quantitatively characterized and their observed behavior was modeled. Edges aligned to specific crystallographic orientations remain straight as they retract, while edges with other crystallographic orientations develop in-plane facets composed of kinetically stable edges. Therefore, a quantitative understanding of the retraction of kinetically stable edges can {{serve as the basis for}} understanding the retraction of edges with all other orientations. Measurements of the rates of retraction of kinetically stable edges for single crystal (100) and (110) Ni films on single crystal MgO are reported. In cross section, the retracting edges develop out-of-plane facets that are generally consistent with the facets expected from the equilibrium Wulff shape. To capture the observed anisotropic character of the edge retraction rate, capillarity-driven edge retraction through atomic surface self-diffusion was modeled in 2 dimensions using the crystalline formulation method developed by Carter and coworkers. The model and experiments show a similar time scaling for the edge <b>retraction</b> <b>distance.</b> Also, the magnitudes of the predicted retraction rates are consistent with the specific observed retraction rate anisotropy given the large range of error in parameters used in the model. Other possible sources of error include the fact that actual edges are not fully facetted and are sometimes bound by non-equilibrium facets. by Gye Hyun Kim. Thesis (S. M.)
