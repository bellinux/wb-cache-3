40|$|Identification of {{determinants}} of human tropism of {{porcine endogenous retrovirus}} (PERV) is critical to understanding the risk of transmission <b>of</b> PERV to <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> porcine <b>xenotransplantation</b> products. Previously, we showed that a chimeric envelope cDNA encoding the 360 N-terminal residues of the human-tropic PERV envelope class A (PERV-A) SU and the 130 C-terminal residues of the pig-tropic PERV-C SU and all of TM (PERV-A/C) showed a 100 -fold decrease in infectivity titer on human cells (M. Gemeniano, O. Mpanju, D. R. Salomon, M. V. Eiden, and C. A. Wilson, Virology 346 : 108 - 117, 2006). To identify residues important for human cell infection, we performed site-directed mutagenesis {{on each of the}} nine residues, singly or in combination, that distinguish the C-terminal region of PERV-C from PERV-A. Of the nine amino acids, two single-amino-acid substitutions, Q 374 R and I 412 V, restored the infectivity of human cells to the chimeric PERV-A/C to a titer equivalent to that of PERV-A. In contrast, PERV-A/C mutant envelope Q 439 P resulted in undetectable infection of human cells and an approximately 1, 000 -fold decrease in control pig cells. Mutation of K 441 R rescued mutants that carried Q 439 P, suggesting an incompatibility between the proline residue at this position and the presence of KK in the proteolytic cleavage signal. We confirmed this incompatibility with vectors carrying PERV-A envelope mutant R 462 K that were also rendered noninfectious. Finally, tropism of vectors carrying PERV-C envelope mutants with only four amino acid changes in the C terminus of PERV-C envelope, NHRQ 436 YNRP plus K 441 R, was shifted to one similar to that of PERV-A. Our results show an important and previously unrecognized role for infectivity and tropism for residues at the C terminus of SU...|$|R

The wide-scale application <b>of</b> clinical islet <b>xenotransplantation,</b> however, requires that such a procedure {{takes place in a}} specifically and tightly regulated environment. With a view to promoting the safe application <b>of</b> clinical islet <b>xenotransplantation,</b> a few years ago the International Xenotransplantation Association (IXA) published a Consensus Statement that outlined the key ethical and regulatory requirements to be satisfied before the initiation <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation</b> studies in diabetic patients.

This situation clearly fell short of the 2004 World Health Assembly Resolution WHA 57. 18 that urged Member States "to cooperate in the formulation of recommendations and guidelines to harmonize global practices" to ensure the highest ethical and regulatory standards on a global scale. In this new IXA report, IXA members who are active in xenotransplantation research in their respective geographic areas herewith briefly describe changes in the regulatory frameworks that have taken place in the intervening period in the various geographic areas or countries. The key reassuring take-home message of the present report is that many countries have embraced the encouragement of the WHO to harmonize the procedures in a more global scale. Indeed, important regulatory changes have taken place or are in progress in several geographic areas that include Europe, Korea, Japan, and China. Such significant regulatory changes encompass the most diverse facets of the clinical application <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation</b> and comprise ethical aspects, source animals and product specifications, study supervision, sample archiving, patient follow-up and even insurance coverage in some legislations.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Xenotransplantation carries {{inherent}} {{risks of}} infectious disease transmission to the recipient {{and even to}} society at large, and it should only be carried out with strict regulation and oversight. In collaboration with the International Xenotransplantation Association, the University Hospital Geneva, and the World Health Organization, an international inventory has been established (www. humanxenotransplant. org) aiming to collect basic data on all types of currently ongoing or recently performed xenotransplantation procedures in humans. METHODS: We collected information from publications in scientific journals, presentations at international congresses, the internet, and declarations <b>of</b> International <b>Xenotransplantation</b> Association members on xenotransplantation procedures in humans performed during the past 15 years. RESULTS: We identified a total of 29 human applications <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation,</b> including 7 that were currently ongoing. Procedures involved transplantation of xenogeneic cells, i. e., islets of Langerhans, kidney cells, chromaffin cells, embryonic stem cells, fetal and adult cells from various organs or extracorporeal perfusion using hepatocytes, liver, spleen, or kidney. The treatments were performed in 12 different countries, 9 of them having no national regulation on xenotransplantation. CONCLUSION: Several clinical applications <b>of</b> cell <b>xenotransplantation</b> are ongoing around the world, often without any clear governmental regulation.

40|$|The {{application}} <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation</b> faces daunting immunological hurdles, some {{of which}} might be overcome with the induction of tolerance. Porcine organs transplanted into primates are subject to several types of rejection responses. Hyperacute rejection mediated by naturally occurring xenoreactive antibodies and complement can be overcome without tolerance. Acute vascular rejection and cellular rejection, however, may present important opportunities for immunological tolerance, and humoral rejection might be approached by various mechanisms including (i) clonal deletion, (ii) anergy, (iii) immune deviation, (iv) induction of immunoregulatory or suppressor cells, or (v) veto cells. B-cell tolerance, useful for preventing humoral rejection, might be approached through clonal anergy. It remains to be determined, however, whether tolerance induction is required for xenotransplantation and by which means the various mechanisms of tolerance can be applied in the setting <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation.</b> Regardless, the study of tolerance will surely expand understanding of the physiology and pathophysiology of the immune system...|$|R

Moreover, people's attitudes to xenotransplantation vary: surveys among intensive-care staff have revealed negative opinions, while the general public and students seem to be more positive. Little is known about the influence of schooling and the choice of university faculty on attitudes to <b>xenotransplantation.</b> The aims <b>of</b> this study were: (i) to evaluate university students' attitudes to xenotransplantation; (ii) to investigate any socio-demographic, religious and educational determinants behind students' opinions on xenotransplantation. University undergraduates on five different courses were surveyed at Padua University. A 24 -item questionnaire was distributed to students at the end of lectures and completed anonymously immediately after its distribution. No information was given to students beforehand. Statistical analysis: chi-squared, Pearson's test; P-values < 0. 05 were considered significant. A total of 585 of 602 (97. 2 %) students completed the questionnaire (132 males, 453 females, mean age 20. 4, range 19 to 43 yr). They were on courses in Medicine (33. 85 %), Agriculture (5. 98 %), Veterinary Medicine (11. 45 %), Psychology (18. 46 %) and Educational Sciences (30. 26 %). As for their previous schooling, they came from classical or scientific high school (58. 3 %), technical college (14. 7 %), language college (6. 3 %), teacher training college (11. 9 %) or others (8. 8 %). Concerning their religious beliefs, 83 % were Catholics, and 56. 2 % defined themselves as practising Catholics.

40|$|The chronic {{shortage}} of human transplants to treat tissue and organ failure {{has led to}} the development <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation,</b> the transplantation <b>of</b> cells, tissues and organs from another species to human recipients. For a number of reasons, pigs are best suited as donor animals. Successful, routine xenotransplantation would have an enormous impact on the health of the human population, including the young, who sometimes require a replacement organ or islet cells, but especially the elderly, who more often suffer the consequences of organ failure. The first form <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation</b> applied to humans is the use of pig islet cells to treat insulin-dependent diabetes, a procedure that will have a significant economic impact. However, although xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues and organs may save and prolong the lives of patients, it may also be associated with the transmission of porcine microorganisms to the recipient, eventually resulting in emerging infectious diseases. For this reason, the health of both the donor animals and the human recipients represents a special and sensitive case of the One Health concept. Basic research leading to strategies how to prevent transmission of porcine microorganisms by selection of virus-free animals, treatment of donor pigs by antiviral drugs, vaccines, colostrum deprivation, early weaning, Caesarean delivery, embryo transfer and/or gene editing should be undertaken to supply an increasing number <b>of</b> potential <b>recipients</b> with urgently required transplants. The methods developed for the detection and elimination of porcine microorganisms in the context <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation</b> will also contribute to an improvement in the health of pig populations in general and an increase in the quality of meat products.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cyclophosphamide (CYP) and {{methotrexate}} (MTX) {{have been}} used as immunosuppressants in induction or maintenance protocols in a large variety <b>of</b> <b>xenotransplantation</b> models. Combining the use of transgenic porcine organs expressing human decay-accelerating factor (hDAF) with immunosuppressive therapy that included the use of CYP or MTX, survival <b>of</b> primate <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> life-supporting renal xenografts has been prolonged. However, both drugs can cause significant systemic toxicity and, in particular, gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. To date only limited data have been reported on the histopathological features deriving from the use of such agents in non-human primates. METHODS: Cyclophosphamide or MTX was used as part of the immunosuppressive regimen in 15 bilaterally nephrectomized non-human primate (Macaca fascicularis) <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> a life-supporting hDAF porcine kidney. At post-mortem, a detailed analysis of the GI tract in animals receiving either CYP or MTX was performed. Paraffin-embedded sections of each portion of the GI tract were prepared and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). In some animals, additional investigations by immunohistochemistry (CD 3, CD 5, CD 20, CD 79 alpha cy, lambda, and kappa light chains) and by in situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) were undertaken. RESULTS: The xenografted animals from the CYP group had a mean survival of 31 days (range: 0 to 90 days); animals from the MTX group survived a median of 14 days (range: 0 to 39 days). GI complications were the most frequent cause of euthanasia after renal failure. In CYP-treated animals GI-tract lesions were primarily characterized by diffuse, severe lymphoplasmocytic mucosal inflammatory infiltrate. Variable degrees of villi atrophy and fusion, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and goblet cell hyperplasia were also observed. In MTX-treated primates, findings were consistent with severe villi atrophy associated with mild-to-moderate disseminated lymphoplasmocytic infiltration. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, GI tract lesions are an early and consistent finding when CYP or MTX are used as induction agents in this model. The two compounds induce different types of GI tract damage, however, in agreement with their different mechanisms of action. Whilst CYP primarily determines inflammatory lesions, MTX leads to a degenerative type of damage. This study indicates that immunosuppressive drugs can cause severe GI tract damage in primate <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> renal xenografts and may be responsible for life-threatening lesions...|$|R
40|$|Rejection of renal and cardiac xenografts is {{initiated}} when natural antibodies <b>of</b> the <b>recipient</b> bind to donor endothelium, activating complement on {{the surface}} of endothelial cells. Pulmonary xenotransplants, however, reveal less evidence of antibody binding and complement activation and, in contrast to other xenografts, fare worse when the complement <b>of</b> the graft <b>recipient</b> is depleted. Accordingly, we asked whether distinct immunochemical reactions might occur after <b>xenotransplantation</b> <b>of</b> the lung and what implications such reactions might have for pulmonary pathophysiology. Analysis of serum from baboons after transplantation with porcine lungs revealed complexes containing baboon IgM and porcine von Willebrand factor.
