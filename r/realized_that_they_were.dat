5|$|On 7 January 1783, Concorde was {{in company}} with Nymphe. They sighted HMS Raven, which {{initially}} sailed towards them until she <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued until about 9p.m. {{when one of}} the frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away Ravens main topgallant-mast. The chase continued until about 10:30p.m. {{when one of the}} frigates was again in range, with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, Raven, which was under the command of Commander John Wells, struck. The French Navy took Raven into service under the name Cérès, which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.|$|E
5|$|The band {{aimed for}} a tribal sound but {{encountered}} problems including minuscule timing errors; during this period, they refined their percussive sound by experimenting with erecting walls {{to isolate the}} drums and rearranging parts. In February 1996, during the mixing process, guitarist Donnie Steele {{decided to leave the}} band for religious reasons and as a result, Craig Jones joined the band to fill the spot; however, the band <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> incorporating too many samples on their recordings and could not reproduce these sounds live. To solve this problem, Jones moved to full-time sampler and Mick Thomson joined as a guitarist. Mate. Feed. Kill. Repeat. was released on October 31, 1996 with a release party at The Safari, a local club where the band played many of their earliest gigs.|$|E

25|$|Taken utterly by surprise, Callao's crew {{at first}} mistook the American ships for Montojo's {{squadron}} and the gunfire for target practice by Montojo's ships, but quickly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> under attack and hopelessly outgunned. They struck their colors and surrendered to Raleigh. They were quickly paroled ashore at Cavite, {{and it was}} later rumored that the commanding officer of Callao {{was sentenced to death}} by Spanish authorities for not fighting back against the American ships.|$|E
25|$|Roberts {{had long}} {{wanted to write}} romantic {{suspense}} novels in the vein of Mary Stewart, but, {{at the urging of}} her agent, she concentrated on classic contemporary romance novels while she built a following of readers. After moving to Putnam in 1992, the publishing company quickly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> unable to keep up with Roberts's prolific output. They suggested that she adopt a second pseudonym so that {{they would be able to}} publish more of her work each year.|$|E

25|$|It {{was decided}} that the A-24 {{aircraft}} was unsuitable for dive-bombing land combat against the Japanese. The Japanese, possessing air superiority, easily dealt with the dive-bombers and the handful of inferior fighter escorts. After losing eleven A-24s and their two-man crews, the 3d Bombardment Group called off further dive-bomber missions from Jackson Field. They were withdrawn from New Guinea after it was <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not suited for their intended role without adequate fighter protection and they were desperately in need of adequate workshop facilities and spares backup that were unavailable.|$|E
25|$|The bulk of McClellan's army {{concentrated}} around Savage's Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, {{preparing for}} a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp. It did so without centralized direction because McClellan had personally moved south of Malvern Hill after Gaines' Mill without leaving directions for corps movements during the retreat nor naming a second in command. Clouds of black smoke filled the air as the Union troops were ordered to burn anything they could not carry. Union morale plummeted, particularly so for those wounded, who <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not being evacuated from Savage's Station {{with the rest of}} the Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} inquiry {{established that}} in the critical minutes before the collision, Andrea Doria gradually steered to port, attempting a starboard-to-starboard passing, while Stockholm turned about 20° to its starboard, an action intended to widen the passing distance of a port-to-port passing. In fact, they were actually steering towards each other – narrowing, rather than widening, the passing distance. As {{a result of the}} extremely thick fog that enveloped the Doria as the ships approached each other, the ships were quite close by the time visual contact was established. By then, the crews <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> on a collision course, but despite last-minute maneuvers, they could not avoid the collision.|$|E

25|$|On 1 March 1640, a {{fleet of}} five Dutch ships {{appeared}} off Colombo. They anchored opposite the fort, convincing the Portuguese of an imminent attack. On 5 March, a second fleet arrived {{from the direction of}} Negombo and after joining together they sailed towards south. As soon as the ships set out, the Captain General D. António Mascarenhas, the Governor of Portuguese Ceylon, <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> heading for Galle. He hastily organized a relief force under Captain Major Francisco de Mendonça Manuel. It consisted of 323 Portuguese in 12 companies, 1,600 Lascarins under the four Dissawes, 200 Canarese musket men (under their leader Rana), and 100 Kaffir archers.|$|E
25|$|On Sunday, June 29, {{the bulk}} of McClellan's army {{concentrated}} around Savage's Station on the Richmond and York River Railroad, a Federal supply depot since just before Seven Pines, preparing for a difficult crossing through and around White Oak Swamp. It did so without centralized direction because McClellan had personally moved south of Malvern Hill after Gaines's Mill without leaving directions for corps movements during the retreat nor naming a second in command.

25|$|Bucharest {{was shaken}} {{by a series}} of crimes {{committed}} {{in the latter half of}} 1970 and the first months of 1971. An unknown individual would use a hammer, a small ax, an iron bar or a knife to attack restaurant waitresses who were alone and returning from work. He struck after midnight during unusual weather conditions such as snowstorms, driving rain, high winds, freezing cold or fog. Many women would not go outside after 9:00 pm except in large groups or with men. Their terror was heightened by the police's reluctance to release details, leading to wildly exaggerated rumors. After a few crimes, the police <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> dealing with a serial killer; a yearlong investigation, with the help of victims who had survived, led to Rîmaru's arrest on May 27, 1971.|$|E

25|$|The British hired armed cutter Sandwich {{was under}} the command of Lieutenant George Lempriere and {{cruising}} off the coast of Barcelona on 14 June 1799 when she sighted a large fleet. Lempriere believed the vessels to be a British fleet and sailed towards them. When the strange vessels did not reply to the recognition signals, Lempriere <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> enemy vessels and attempted to sail away. The French fleet detached a lugger, possibly Affronteur, to pursue Sandwich. A frigate joined the lugger in pursuit and towards evening the lugger opened fire with her bow chasers. The frigate then too opened fire, with Sandwich returning fire as best she could. By 1a.m. the frigate was within musket shot of Sandwich and any further resistance would have been futile. Lempriere then struck to Créole.|$|E

They were followed by three groups of 100 men assigned to storm the Union works and stream back into the Union rear area. Brig. Gen. Napoleon B. McLaughlen rode to Fort Haskell, just {{to the south of}} Battery XII, which he found to be ready to defend itself. As he moved north, he ordered Battery XII to open fire on Battery XI and a reserve infantry regiment briefly re-captured Battery XI. Assuming that he had sealed the only breach in the line, McLaughlen rode into Fort Stedman and began giving orders to the men. He suddenly <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> Confederates and they realized he was a Union general, capturing him.|$|E

25|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{released}} its {{report on the}} accident on July 5, 1973. It found that the probable cause of the accident was {{the failure of the}} traffic control system to ensure adequate aircraft separation during a period of limited visibility. It noted that non-standard terminology – used to expedite traffic flow – was common in communications between controllers and aircrews at O'Hare International Airport and included the omission of words, altered phraseology, and use of colloquialisms. It found that the lack of clarity of wording {{on the part of the}} ground controller in his communications with Delta Flight 954 and the Delta crew's failure to request confirmation that their taxiing intentions matched those understood by the ground controller were the major causes of the accident. As a result, the controller was confused as to the location of the Convair CV-880, and neither the controller nor its flight crew <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> referring to different run-up pads as the holding area for Delta Flight 954.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{also learned}} much about Massachusetts' mercantile elite; while he {{initially}} considered this knowledge a curse, it {{would prove to}} be a boon to his later activities in Kansas and at Harper's Ferry. The business community had reacted with hesitation when Brown asked them to change their highly profitable practice of selling low-quality wool en masse at low prices. Initially, Brown naively trusted them, but soon <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> determined to maintain their control of price-setting. Also, on the outskirts of Springfield, the Connecticut River Valley's sheep farmers were largely unorganized and hesitant to change their methods of production to meet higher standards. In the Ohio Cultivator, Brown and other wool growers complained that the Connecticut River Valley's farmers' tendencies were lowering all U.S. wool prices abroad. In reaction, Brown made a last-ditch effort to overcome the wool mercantile elite by seeking an alliance with European manufacturers. Ultimately, Brown was disappointed to learn that Europe preferred to buy Western Massachusetts wools en masse at the cheap prices they had been getting from them. Brown then traveled to England to seek a higher price for Springfield's wool. The trip was a disaster, as the firm incurred a loss of $40,000, of which Perkins bore the brunt. With this misfortune, the Perkins and Brown wool commission operation closed in Springfield in late 1849. Subsequent lawsuits tied up the partners for several more years.|$|E
500|$|After {{being unable}} to {{overcome}} the rebels, the noblemen started new negotiations with them at Dellőapáti (Apatiu). The representatives of the two parties reached a new compromise on 6 October, which was included in a new charter in the Kolozsmonostor Abbey four days later. For unknown reasons, the peasants accepted less favorable terms {{than those of the}} first agreement.
