40|$|The COSMOPOLITICAL FUTURES – FATE MAPS - BLACK LACE project {{presents}} a continuous slowly panning projection {{of a highly}} magnified collage of lace set in virtual 3 D space as a scrolling scene drawn line by line by the deflections of the scanning electron beam. The soundtrack is composed from a granular synthesis and series of harmonics derived {{from the sound of}} silk worms instinctively eating their way through Mulberry leaves in preparation for their metamorphosis. Human vision involves the <b>register</b> <b>of</b> <b>light</b> in the retinal nervous system and brain and the non-optical electron materialization of the Chantilly net in the installation alludes to enhanced human perceptions. The superfine human workings of silk fibers of antique black Chantilly lace into their tonal transparencies and tensions are presented as physical network to evoke the bio-synthesis and suspension of human and insect consciousness in the contemporary ethical planetary context. The visual resemblance of Chantilly lace to a photographic negative, the fine working of the silk protein and the intrinsic quantized energies and discrete processes underlying of operation the scanning electron microscope are used to express the intrinsic mystery of evolutionary and developmental metamorphosis co-alliances between humans and animals in social, cultural, economic and bio-scientific domains.

5000|$|Rodent {{studies have}} shown that the master brain clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is {{functional}} in the fetus before the fetal brain is capable <b>of</b> <b>registering</b> the presence <b>of</b> <b>light.</b> Reppert and colleagues reported that the fetal SCN is entrained to the light-dark cycle before the retinohypothalamic pathway innervates the SCN from the eye. [...] This finding indicates that the mother, and her entrainment to ambient light-dark cycles, provides the necessary information to the fetus for synchronization. As Reppert states, “Mom is functioning as the transducer for the fetal circadian system. She takes in light information to her circadian system, and then that is communicated to the fetal circadian system.” This fetal entrainment persists into the postnatal period and ensures that neonatal behavioral patterns are properly tuned with the environment. Dopamine and melatonin can both act as perinatal maternal entraining signals.|$|R

40|$|Summary Modern {{microscopy}} methods require efficient {{image compression}} techniques owing to collection {{of up to}} thousands of images per experiment. Current irreversible techniques such as JPEG and JPEG 2000 are not optimized to preserve {{the integrity of the}} scientific data as required by 21 CFR part 11. Therefore, to construct an irreversible, yet integritypreserving compression mechanism, we establish a model of noise as a function of signal in our imaging system. The noise is then removed with a wavelet shrinkage algorithm whose parameters are adapted to local image structure. We ascertain the integrity of the denoised images by measuring changes in spatial and intensity distributions <b>of</b> <b>registered</b> <b>light</b> in the biological images and estimating changes of the effective microscope MTF. We demonstrate that the proposed denoising procedure leads to a decrease in image file size when a reversible JPEG 2000 coding is used and provides better fidelity than irreversible JPEG and JPEG 2000 at the same compression ratio. We also demonstrate that denoising reduces image artefacts when used as a pre-filtering step prior to irreversible image coding...|$|R
