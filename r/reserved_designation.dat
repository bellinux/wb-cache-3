40|$|The {{establishment}} of a UNESCO Biosphere indicates a shift from traditional conservation of individual areas towards a more regional approach and an inclusive planning and management regime. This study sets out to investigate {{the effects of the}} Biosphere <b>Reserve</b> <b>designation</b> in Mount Carmel, Israel, with special regard to settlement development and stakeholder management. The implications of the Biosphere <b>Reserve</b> <b>designation</b> have been explored through GIS analysis, using LANDSAT satellite data, and through interviews, observations and participatory checking. The empirical findings were analysed in relation to the Biosphere Reserve Statutory Framework, and to theories on territorialisation, space production and participatory planning. The findings suggest that the Biosphere <b>Reserve</b> <b>designation</b> have had very limited effects in the case of Mount Carmel. Settlements have continued to expand into protected areas, and there is no organised structure for stakeholder participation. This study underlines the value of considering context and history in the {{establishment of}} protected areas, and the importance of establishing the Biosphere Reserve concept among the different stakeholders.

Their next assignment was in the British mandate of Palestine, following which 127 PFA became part of the British Army of the Rhine. In 1947, when the Territorial Army was reformed, 127 PFA was re-designated as the 23rd (Parachute) Field Ambulance because the number 127 was a <b>reserve</b> <b>designation.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{reserves}} of Ahousaht, and of neighboring coastal nations, {{are relatively small}} in size to the numbers of the population. It is believed that the <b>reserve</b> <b>designations</b> were tiny because {{the members of the}} Ahousaht nation, at the time of contact, relied very heavily on Oceanic resources as a main staple of dietary and other needs. The ocean was considered to be [...] "the garden" [...] of the people; hence, it was presumed that little land-base was needed to fulfill the ongoing needs of the people.|$|R

50|$|The area is home {{to several}} dozen {{varieties}} of indigenous grapes, {{with the majority of}} wine production being made from the Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz, Jaen, Alfrocheiro Preto and Encruzado. 80% of the region's production is in red wines, with DOC regulations stipulating that at least 20% of the production must be from Touriga Nacional. Some of the top reserve wine may carry the designation Dão nobre (meaning noble Dão). Another <b>reserve</b> <b>designation,</b> Garrafeira, requires wines to be 0.5% higher in alcohol content then the 12.5% minimum and to spend at least 2 years in aging in oak. The maximum yield for red wine grapes is 70 hl/ha.|$|R

50|$|The curved {{route of}} the cutting was {{designed}} to mitigate impact on the skyline, and to fit the local topography. The construction of {{this section of the}} M40 (junctions 5-8) was at the time extremely controversial, since the cutting through the Chiltern Hills was driven through the middle of the ecologically-important Aston Rowant NNR. Conservation groups were appalled at the unexpected decision of the inspector at the public inquiry to reject their claims that the national nature <b>reserve</b> <b>designation</b> implied a fully protected landscape which should in no circumstances be damaged. Their alternative proposals for a tunnelled solution, or a route on-line with the existing A40, were rejected.|$|R
50|$|The {{number of}} tourist visiting the reserve has {{significantly}} increased since {{the creation of}} the reserve. There were 412,000 tourists staying overnight in the villages of Tärnaby, Hemavan, and Ammarnäs in the year 2000. Similarly, the number of tourists staying overnight in one of the cabins along the Kungsleden hiking trail was approximately 5,000 in 2010. Tourism activities are many and varied and include hiking, horseback riding, dog sledding, cross-country skiing, snowmobiling , hunting, fishing, exploring the Sami culture, etc. Many tourist companies are active in the reserve and the Nature <b>Reserve</b> <b>designation</b> Vindelfjällen is actively used to promote tourism, both by local and national agencies.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} find strategic methods in community engagement related to regional sustainable development, specifically {{within the context}} of regions in Europe and North America that are applying for the UNESCO Biosphere <b>Reserve</b> <b>designation.</b> The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development was presented as a planning framework that can fill gaps in the current Biosphere Reserve planning process. A tool for assessing community engagement based on the five Process Characteristics of transparency, cooperation, openness, inclusiveness, and involvement was created and used to explore community engagement practices in six UNESCO Biosphere Reserve regions in Sweden and Canada. The assessment of methods used in those six regions yielded a list of nine methods which stood out in contributing to community engagement...|$|R
50|$|The Puerto Rico GAP Analysis Project {{identified}} {{within the}} NEC 29 of the 70 land cover classes defined for the island, of which 26 {{correspond to the}} major classes of natural vegetation. Importantly, ecosystems located on the coastal plains and low hills of the NEC, represent one of the regions most impacted by anthropogenic activities in Puerto Rico. Today, this physiographic zone {{is one of the}} least protected in the island. Therefore, proponents of protected status for the NEC contend that a nature <b>reserve</b> <b>designation</b> provides an opportunity to preserve the ecological integrity of this important ecosystem while preventing habitat fragmentation; one of the main arguments that lead to nature reserve status in 2013.|$|R

Local stakeholders have been involved in guiding plans on future management of both islands’ resources including Biosphere <b>Reserve</b> <b>designation</b> of the San Andres Archipelago {{and the development of a}} Special Law for Galapagos.

5000|$|San Vicente Creek (Spanish for [...] "St. Vincent") is a 3.9 mi coastal {{stream in}} {{northern}} California which flows entirely within San Mateo County and discharges to the Pacific Ocean. Its waters rise {{on the west}} facing slopes of the Montara Mountain, block and its mouth is at the unincorporated community of Moss Beach, within the Fitzgerald Marine Reserve. Historically there was a tidal marsh at its mouth, but some of this reach has been degraded by fill, especially {{in the construction of}} West Point Drive. This westernmost reach of the creek has been especially ecologically productive, and {{part of the reason for}} Fitzgerald Marine <b>Reserve's</b> <b>designation</b> on August 5, 1969 as a state reserve and was named after James V.
