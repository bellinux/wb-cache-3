25|$|In the 20th century, {{new types}} of glass such as {{laminated}} glass, <b>reinforced</b> <b>glass</b> and glass bricks increased the use of glass as a building material and resulted in new applications of glass. Multi-story buildings are frequently constructed with curtain walls made almost entirely of glass. Similarly, laminated glass has been widely applied to vehicles for windscreens. Optical glass for spectacles has been used since the Middle Ages. The production of lenses has become increasingly proficient, aiding astronomers as well as having other application in medicine and science. Glass is also employed as the aperture cover in many solar energy collectors.|$|E

However, as New Zealand legislation prohibits the export of such historic items, the Imperial War Museum agreed to a permanent loan of the medals to the Waiouru Army Museum. On 2 December 2007, Upham's VC was among nine stolen from locked, <b>reinforced</b> <b>glass</b> cabinets at the museum.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to achieve the highest {{compressive}} strength of <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe with the geopolymer filler content of weight percentage that were used in <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe. The samples were prepared by using the filament winding method. The effect of weight percentage of geopolymer materials in epoxy hardener was studied under mechanical testing, which is using the compression test. A series of <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe and <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe filled with 10 – 40 weight percentage geopolymer filler which is white clay were prepared. The compression strength of the <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe filled geopolymer materials is determined using Instron Universal Testing under compression mode. It was found that compressive strength for samples with white clay geopolymer filler are much higher compare to <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe without geopolymer filler. Moreover, the compressive strength of <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe filled with white clay geopolymer filler was increased from 10 wt% to 30 wt% of geopolymer content. However, the compressive strength of <b>glass</b> <b>reinforced</b> epoxy pipe with white clay geopolymer filler suddenly decreased when added to 40 wt%. The results indicated that the blending of geopolymer materials in epoxy system can be obtained in this study...|$|R

Silica is the primary component {{of all types of}} standard and specialty glass. In its pulverized form, ground silica is used in the production of fiberglass insulation and <b>reinforcing</b> <b>glass</b> fibers. Glass is produced by melting silica at high very high temperatures along with a mixture of soda ash, lime from limestone, and feldspar.

40|$|Many rubber {{products}} are <b>reinforced</b> with <b>glass</b> fibers to give dimensional stability, high modulus, and good fatigue life. To understand failure of these products, {{it is essential}} to understand the failure and strength degradation mechanisms of the <b>reinforcing</b> <b>glass</b> multifilament bundles. An empirical model has been developed to predict fast fracture and time-dependent failure of these bundles using the global load sharing approximation. The model is based on the statistical strength distribution of glass fibers, fracture mechanics of glass, and nonlinear stress distribution between individual fibers owing to sliding resistance of matrix. The model was also used to predict the residual strength of the bundle as a function of load and time...|$|R
