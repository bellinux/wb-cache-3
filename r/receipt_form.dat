[...] He produced a bright little stew-pan from his collection of culinary utensils as he spoke. [...] "Properly pursued, the Art of Cookery allows of no divided attention," [...] he continued, gravely. [...] "In that observation {{you will find the}} reason why no woman ever has reached, or ever will reach, the highest distinction as a cook. As a rule, women are incapable of absolutely concentrating their attention on any one occupation for any given time. Their minds will run on something else--say; typically, for the sake of illustration, their sweetheart or their new bonnet. The one obstacle, Mrs. Valeria, to your rising equal to the men in the various industrial processes of life is not raised, as the women vainly suppose, by the defective institutions of the age they live in. No! the obstacle is in themselves. No institutions that can be devised to encourage them will ever be strong enough to contend successfully with the sweetheart and the new bonnet. A little while ago, for instance, I was instrumental in getting women employed in our local post-office here. The other day I took the trouble--a serious business to me--of getting downstairs, and wheeling myself away to the office to see how they were getting on. I took a letter with me to register. It had an unusually long address. The registering woman began copying the address on the <b>receipt</b> <b>form,</b> in a business-like manner cheering and delightful to see. Half way through, a little child-sister of one of the other women employed trotted into the office, and popped under the counter to go and speak to her relative. The registering woman's mind instantly gave way. Her pencil stopped; her eyes wandered off to the child with a charming expression of interest. 'Well, Lucy,' she said, 'how d'ye do?' Then she remembered business again, and returned to her receipt. When I took it across the counter, an important line in the address of my letter was left out in the copy. Thanks to Lucy. Now a man in the same position would not have seen Lucy--he would have been too closely occupied with what he was about at the moment. There is the whole difference between the mental constitution of the sexes, which no legislation will ever alter as long as the world lasts! What does it matter? Women are infinitely superior to men in the moral qualities which are the true adornments of humanity. Be content--oh, my mistaken sisters, be content with that!" ...|$|E

All batches of test material were stored under – 18 ºC and protected from light prior to and after packaging.   Aflatoxins in the test materials were determinated by immunoaffinity with liquid chromatography (LC) with pos-column derivatization and thin layer chromatography (TLC).   Zearalenone in the test materials were determined by solid phase column (Romer 224 TM) with LC.   Four homogeneus maize materials were prepared: blank for zearalenone, blank for aflatoxins and two naturally contaminated for aflatoxins.   These samples were used to validated analytical methods and as reference samples for proficiency test.   The participating laboratories received refrigerated parcel containing: coded maize samples and blank for spiking purpose, test material <b>receipt</b> <b>form,</b> additional instructions, results reporting sheets and analytical work questionnaire in 3 rounds.   The results were evaluated by using z-score function being calculated considering the best value representing the true measure of mycotoxin in the sample (as per evaluation in the homogeneity tests).   Additional FAPAS test material for mycotoxins were purchased in order to assess the laboratory performance and to validated the reference materials.   In case of “questionable” or “unsatisfactory” results, the Laboratory were advised to treate them as non conforming work, make the necessary modifications and adjustments in the methods, taking into account the method performance criteria (CEN).   The laboratories were strongly recommended to write a report containing the analysis of the causes and correctives actions proposed, giving special attention to: correct use of calibrated pipettes; chromatographic condition including the calibration curve and injected volume of extract and standard...|$|E

The nonrational assumption is that a gamble of gains and losses is indifferent to the joint receipt of its gains pitted against the status quo and of its losses against the status quo. This article extends four previous papers (Lute, 1988, in press (a); Lute and Narens, 198. 5; Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) that have developed partial, more-or-less descriptive theories for choices among uncertain alternatives or, briefly, gambles.

40|$|Abstract—In densely {{populated}} cities, Wi-Fi networks—private or otherwise—are ubiquitous. We {{focus on the}} provision of citywide broadband communication capability to mobile users through private Wi-Fi networks that are in range but belong to others. We form a club that relies on indirect reciprocity: Members participate in the club and provide free Wi-Fi access to other members in order to enjoy the same benefit when they are away from their own Wi-Fi network. Our club scheme does not require registration with an authority and does not rely on centrally issued club identities: Members create their own identities (public-private key pairs) and receive signed digital receipts when they provide Wi-Fi service to other members. These <b>receipts</b> <b>form</b> a distributed <b>receipt</b> graph, parts of which are used as input to an indirect reciprocity algorithm that classifies club members according to their contribution. We show that our algorithm can sustain cooperation within the club and is robust to attacks by free-riders.

Dematerialization of warehouse receipts is more complex than that for financial securities, because of the individual characteristics of each warehouse receipt.

Nevertheless, the movement towards the electronic warehouse receipt, which began several decades ago with financial securities, is now taking hold in the agricultural sector.
