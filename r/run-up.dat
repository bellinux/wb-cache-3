50|$|To {{lessen the}} noise impact to the community, MCAS Miramar has made {{adjustments}} to their operations over the years, {{including the use}} of hush-houses, limitations on engine <b>run-ups,</b> and modification to flight plans.|$|R
5|$|Another service {{offered by}} the baths was voter registration. In the <b>run-up</b> to the 1980 election, the New St. Mark's Baths in New York City, with the {{assistance}} of the League of Women Voters, conducted a voter registration drive on its premises.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>run-up</b> to the elections, a CH-53E {{helicopter}} crashed near Al-Rutbah on 26 January, {{killing all}} 31 Marines and sailors, {{most of whom}} were members of 1st Battalion 3rd Marines and who had survived the Second Battle of Fallujah. This was the single deadliest incident for US troops in the Iraq War.|$|E
5|$|Following the Second Battle of Fallujah, the Marines faced {{three main}} tasks: {{providing}} humanitarian {{assistance to the}} hundreds of thousands of refugees returning to the city, retaking the numerous towns and cities they had abandoned along the Euphrates in the <b>run-up</b> to the battle, and providing security for the Iraqi parliamentary elections scheduled for 30 January.|$|E
30|$|Suppose {{submarine}} Landslide S 4 occurs. The TOPICS submarine landslide-generated surge {{model is}} used to establish a 672 [*]×[*] 673 km 2 submarine landslide-generated tsunami model, so as to predict formation, spreading and <b>run-ups</b> within 4.5 h of a tsunami.|$|R
50|$|The tsunami {{affected}} a {{large part}} of the Aegean Sea. The variable distribution of the observed <b>run-ups,</b> combined with inconsistent timing of the wave arrivals at different locations, suggest that earthquake-triggered underwater landslides were the main cause of the observed tsunami.|$|R
50|$|This {{would have}} a major impact on the 34,000 {{permanent}} residences along the lake, not to mention the impact on tourism in the area. Tsunami <b>run-ups</b> would leave areas near the lake inundated due to permanent ground subsidence attributed to the earthquake, with the highest <b>run-ups</b> and amplitudes being attributed to the seiches rather than the actual tsunami. The reason seiches cause so much damage is due to resonance within the bays reflecting the waves where they combine to make larger standing waves. For more information see seiches. Lake Tahoe also experienced a massive collapse of the western edge of the basin that formed McKinney Bay around 50,000 years ago. Is thought to have generated a tsunami/seiche wave with a height approaching 330 ft.|$|R
5|$|In the <b>run-up</b> to deregulation, London Country Bus Services (LCBS) {{was broken}} into four smaller {{companies}} on 7 September 1986. Three {{hundred and fifty}} buses, the garages at Hatfield, Hertford, Stevenage, Harlow, St Albans and the isolated base at Grays formed the new London Country North East (LCNE) company.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>run-up</b> to the final, {{the three}} finalists and Lloyd Webber visited Salzburg to visit {{some of the}} {{locations}} made famous by The Sound of Music, including Leopoldskron Palace and Nonnberg Abbey, to give the finalists a chance to understand the real Maria von Trapp.|$|E
5|$|Menzies {{retired in}} January 1966, and was succeeded as prime {{minister}} by the new Liberal Party leader, Harold Holt.

50|$|Law 17: Practice on the field. There {{may be no}} batting or bowling {{practice}} on the pitch except before the day's play starts and after the day's play has ended. Bowlers may only have trial <b>run-ups</b> if the umpires are of the view that it would waste no time.|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} in ination can fuel <b>run-ups</b> in housing prices if people su¤er from money illusion. For example, investors who base their {{decision on whether}} to rent or buy a house simply on monthly rent relative to current monthly mort-gage payments do not properly take into account that ination lowers future real mortgage payments. Therefore, they systematically misevaluate real estate. After empirically decomposing the price-rent ratio in a rational component and an implied mispricing, we 8 ̆ 5 nd that (i) ination and the nominal interest rate ex-plain a large share of the time-series variation of the mispricing, (ii) the <b>run-ups</b> in housing prices starting in the late 1990 s is reconcilable with the contempora-neous {{reduction in}} ination and nominal interest rates, and (iii) the tilt e¤ect alone is unlikely to rationalize these 8 ̆ 5 ndings...|$|R

5|$|Robinson's first {{position}} in broadcasting was at Piccadilly Radio in Manchester, {{which he took}} up while recovering from his injuries. He joined the BBC in 1986 as a production trainee, and later worked extensively as a television and radio producer {{for a variety of}} shows including Newsround and Crimewatch. He then became an assistant producer for On the Record, and in 1993 was promoted to deputy editor of Panorama, a position he held for three years. In 1995, whilst Robinson was at Panorama, he wrote an internal BBC memorandum questioning how an interview with Prime Minister John Major could be defended in the <b>run-up</b> to the Scottish local elections. When leaked, this gained attention from the Labour Party, which perceived it as the legitimised denial of equal time in the <b>run-up</b> to local elections.|$|E
5|$|Tibetan Filmmaker Dhondup Wangcheng {{was sentenced}} to six {{years in prison for}} making a {{documentary}} on human rights in Tibet in the <b>run-up</b> to the Beijing Olympics.

5|$|A Passion for Churches is a 1974 BBC {{television}} documentary written and {{presented by the}} then Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman and produced and directed by Edward Mirzoeff. Commissioned as a follow-up to the critically acclaimed 1973 documentary Metro-land, the film offers Betjeman's personal poetic record of the goings-on taking place throughout the Anglican Diocese of Norwich and its churches in the <b>run-up</b> to Easter Sunday using the framing device of the Holy sacraments.|$|E
50|$|The {{easing of}} credit also coincided with {{spectacular}} stock market <b>run-ups</b> from 1999 to 2000. The NASDAQ, {{at less than}} 800 points in 1994, surged to over 5,000 in March 2000. The Dow Jones Industrial Index traded at roughly 2,000 points in 1990 and 4,000 in 1995, nearly tripled to over 11,000 by mid-2000.|$|R
25|$|According to Barker and Rosenwater England {{did well}} {{to get so}} close to winning as they did, Australia gaining a large {{advantage}} from batting first. The ground was very wet when play began, and the pitch was initially slow and easy. Furthermore, the bowlers' <b>run-ups</b> were so slippery that Lockwood was unable to bowl for over an hour.|$|R
50|$|The maximum {{recorded}} {{wave height}} was 10 meters on the Kumano coast. <b>Run-ups</b> {{in excess of}} 5 meters were also recorded at several locations along the coasts of Mie and Wakayama Prefectures. The tsunami was observed along the Pacific coast of Japan from Izu Peninsula to Kyushu, and recorded by tide gauges from Alaska to Hawaii.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the poor {{economic}} conditions, Eurostar received state aid in May 2009 to cancel out some of the accumulated debt from the High Speed 1 construction programme. Later that year, during snowy conditions in the <b>run-up</b> to Christmas, thousands of passengers were left stranded as several trains broke down and many more were cancelled. In an independent review commissioned by Eurostar, the company came in for serious criticism about its handling of the incident and lack of plans for such a scenario.|$|E
5|$|During the 192728 season, Halcombe was {{selected}} {{in only one}} match, taking 1/119 as South Australia were defeated by Victoria by an innings and 310 runs. He scored three not out and a duck in the match. After playing only one match in the previous season, Halcombe transferred to Western Australia. During his time in South Australia, Halcombe had played in matches officiated by Test umpire George Hele without his action being called into question. Of short stature for a fast bowler, Halcombe generated high pace from a short <b>run-up.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1907, {{after the}} old Boer republics {{received}} self-government, {{and in the}} <b>run-up</b> {{to the formation of}} the Union of South Africa, leading Afrikaner politicians J.C. Smuts and L. Botha asked Reitz to return to South Africa and play a role in politics again. Together with his wife, he established himself in Sea Point, Cape Town. In 1910, already sixty-six years old, he was appointed president of the Senate of the newly formed Union of South Africa.|$|E
40|$|The authors {{study the}} price [...] volume {{dynamics}} {{ahead of the}} first public announcement of a takeover for 420 Canadian firms from 1985 to 2002. Pre-bid price <b>run-ups</b> in a target firm's shares {{may be caused by}} some combination of information leakage due to illegal insider trading or market anticipation based on rumours in the press. The authors review empirical studies of illegal insider trading and trading ahead of unscheduled announcements to generate predictions for abnormal returns and abnormal volume ahead of the takeover announcement. They observe serially correlated volume and a pattern of return reversals in their sample. Pre-bid <b>run-ups</b> occur shortly before the actual announcement, accompanied by significantly positive abnormal returns and share volume. The stock prices of the target firm react significantly to the actual announcement, with both positive and negative reactions. These price–volume dynamics are more consistent with the predictions of the market anticipation hypothesis than the hypothesis of illegal insider trading. Financial markets...|$|R

5|$|In August 2016, the Baku Chess Olympiad Operating Committee branded two {{double-decker}} buses of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism {{to operate in}} the city in the <b>run-up</b> and during the Olympiad. They were officially launched in late August with a ceremony during which members of the Azerbaijani national team were playing chess inside. The buses operated free of charge and took passengers to Baku's main sights. The passengers have the chance to play chess inside the buses and obtain information about the Olympiad. The buses ended operating on 14 September.|$|E
5|$|In {{some ways}} the <b>run-up</b> to Plataea resembled that at the Battle of Marathon; there was a {{prolonged}} stalemate in which neither side risked attacking the other. The reasons for this stalemate were primarily tactical, and similar to the situation at Marathon; the Greek hoplites {{did not want to}} risk being outflanked by the Persian cavalry and the lightly armed Persian infantry could not hope to assault well-defended positions.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel adaptive control scheme, with improved convergence rate, for the equalization of harmonic disturbances such as engine noise. First, modifications for improving convergence {{speed of the}} standard filtered-X LMS control are described. Equalization capabilities are then implemented, allowing the independent tuning of harmonics. Eventually, by providing the desired order vs. engine speed profiles, the pursued sound quality attributes can be achieved. The proposed control scheme is first demonstrated with a simple secondary path model and, then, experimentally validated {{with the aid of}} a vehicle mockup which is excited with engine noise. The engine excitation is provided by a real-time sound quality equivalent engine simulator. Stationary and transient engine excitations are used to assess the control performance. The results reveal that the proposed controller is capable of large order-level reductions (up to 30 dB) for stationary excitation, which allows a comfortable margin for equalization. The same holds for slow <b>run-ups</b> (> 15 s) thanks to the improved convergence rate. This margin, however, gets narrower with shorter <b>run-ups</b> (<= 10 s). status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} ability of venture capitalists to time market {{conditions}} when deciding {{between public and private}} financings as well as issuance of follow-on offerings, focusing on a segment of the U. S. biotechnology industry. This has been assessed by studying the timing of public vs. private financings measured against market conditions during and around the time of financings. We find evidence of pseudo market-timing, meaning that the decision of venture capitalists to take a company public is a response to market sector <b>run-ups,</b> not because future market returns are predictable. Further, when examining financing events post-IPO, our findings show that there is significant correlation between firm specific returns and market sector <b>run-ups,</b> and the prospect of issuing new equity within one and two years post-IPO. Taking the perspective of IPOs and follow-on offerings as facilitating mechanisms for venture capitalists in the process of exiting their equity positions and realising returns on investment, it appears that venture capitalists operating in the biotechnology industry, can time the market...|$|R
