5|$|Lucas v. Earl is {{a leading}} case {{in the area of}} U.S. income taxation, and stands for the Anticipatory Assignment of Income Doctrine. In the case, Mr. Earl was arguing that because he and his wife, in the year 1901, had made a legally valid {{assignment}} agreement (for state law purposes) to have his then-current and after-acquired income (which was earned solely by him) be treated as the income of both him and his wife as joint tenants with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship,</b> the assignment agreement should also determine the federal income tax effect of the income he earned (i.e., only half the income should be taxed to him).|$|E
2500|$|Another type of {{fractional}} ownership, {{not part}} of a securitized business plan is Tenancy in Common, which is grounded in the real property laws of most, if not all states. The main difference is there is no <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> to the sponsor or other owners if one or more of owners were to pass away. Where there are similarities with the equal sharing of operational expenses, rental income and access, the striking difference is free transferability of the owner's interest in the property without regard to the other owners in the property.|$|E
50|$|In {{most states}} joint tenancy with the <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> {{requires}} all owners to have equal {{interests in the}} property, meaning upon sale or partition of the property, all owners would receive an equal distribution of the proceeds. Joint ownership may also be by tenants in common (TIC). In some states, joint ownership is presumed to be as tenants in common unless the parties are married and the deed so states or the deed sets for joint tenants with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship.</b> Upon death, the decedent's share passes {{to his or her}} estate.|$|E

50|$|A {{co-owner}} {{of a joint}} tenancy with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> deed may sever the joint tenancy by filing a petition to partition. A petition to partition is a legal right, so usually {{there is no way}} to stop such an action. When a court grants a partition action for a joint tenants with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> deed, the property is either physically broken into parts and each owner is given a part of equal value OR the property is sold and the proceeds are distributed equally between the co-owners regardless of contribution to purchase price. No credits would be issued to any tenant who may have made a superior contribution toward purchase price.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{joint tenancy}} with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> deed, or JTWROS, {{the death of}} one tenant means that the {{surviving}} tenant(s) become the sole owner(s) of the estate. Nothing passes to the heirs of the deceased tenant. In some jurisdictions, the specific words [...] "with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> survivorship" [...] must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship.</b> The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of his/her contribution to purchase price. If the property is someday sold or subdivided, the proceeds must be distributed equally with no credits given for any excess than any one co-owner may have contributed to purchase the property.|$|R
50|$|A {{joint tenancy}} or joint tenancy with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> (JTROS, JTWROS or JT TEN WROS) {{is a type}} of {{concurrent}} estate in which co-owners have a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship,</b> meaning that if one owner dies, that owner's interest in the property will pass to the surviving owner or owners by operation of law, and avoiding probate. The deceased owner's interest in the property simply evaporates and cannot be inherited by his or her heirs. Under this type of ownership, the last owner living owns all the property, and on his or her death the property will form part of their estate. Unlike a tenancy in common, where co-owners may have unequal interests in a property, joint co-owners have an equal share in the property.|$|E

50|$|Rights {{that arise}} by {{operation}} of law often arise by design of certain contingencies set forth in a legal instrument. If a life estate is created in a tract of land, and the person by whose life the estate is measured dies, title to the property reverts to the original grantor - or, possibly, to the grantor's legal heirs - by {{operation of law}}. Nothing needs {{to be put in}} writing to affirm that this will happen. Joint tenants with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> create a similar situation. Joint tenants with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> deeds are always taken in equal shares, and when one joint tenant dies, the other tenants equally acquire title by virtue of the terms of the conveyance itself, by operation of law.|$|R
50|$|Estates may be held jointly as joint tenants with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> or as tenants in common.

50|$|When deeds {{are taken}} as joint tenants with <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship</b> (JTWROS) or joint tenants in common (TIC), any {{co-owner}} can file a petition for partition {{to dissolve the}} tenancy relationship. JTWROS deed holders always take the property in equal shares; therefore, if the partnership is dissolved through partition, the proceeds must be equally distributed between all of the co-owners without regard to how much each co-owner contributed to the purchase price of the property. No credits would be allowed for any excess contributions to the purchase price. For example, if A and B co-own property as JTWROS and A contributed 80% of the purchase price, A and B would still receive equal distributions upon partition. On the other hand, TIC deed holders may be granted at partition a credit for unequal contributions to purchase price. During either partition, credits may be awarded to any co-owner who may have contributed in excess of his share to the property expenses after taking deed to the property. Credits may be allowed for utilities and maintenance; however, credits for improvements may not be allowed unless the improvements actually added substantial value to the property.|$|R
50|$|In 1798, the New York Legislature, {{with the}} {{assistance}} of Aaron Burr authorized aliens to hold land directly, and the trustees conveyed the Holland Purchase to the real owners.

Each set of proprietors owned their tract as “joint tenants” with <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>survivorship,</b> which means as proprietors died off, the surviving proprietors took the deceased's share, and that share did not pass by will or inheritance, except {{in the case of the}} last survivor.|$|E
50|$|The more {{important}} tax {{aspect of a}} transmutation agreement is the effect that it has on basis step-up (or step-down) at death.
