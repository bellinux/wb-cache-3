40|$|The {{results and}} {{analysis}} of a well-diagnosed, dedicated rotation experiment in TFTR are presented. Various neoclassical and anomalous theories for momentum transport are described and compared with the experimental data. The gyroviscocity theory is able to predict the measured central toroidal rotation speed, momentum confinement time and <b>radial</b> <b>torque</b> flow profile reasonably well when a poloidal asymmetry factor {tilde {Theta}} = 1. 5 is used. The cold-ion-perpendicular-viscocity theory requires the assumption of an implausibly large number of cold ions in order to predict {{the magnitude of the}} experimental torque flow. The ion-temperature-gradient-mode theory, the untrapped-particle-electrostatic-mode theory and the stochastic-magnetic-perturbation theory all predict torque flows that differ greatly in magnitude, radial profile and parametric dependence from the experimental values...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{generation}} of the toroidal rotation due to the <b>radial</b> current <b>torque</b> induced by the charge separation is studied by using one-dimensional multi-fluid transport code TASK/TX. Taking account {{of the effect of}} the drift orbit, the charge separation occurs as long as trapped ions are generated, typically by near-perpendicular NBI. Coupling the TASK/TX code with the Orbit-Following Monte Carlo code OFMC, we have reproduced the toroidal rotation driven by the radial current by the near-perpendicular NBI with varying its vertical injection (poloidal) angle and clarified that the horizontal NBI drives the toroidal rotation most efficiently. By utilizing the <b>radial</b> current <b>torque,</b> we have elucidated that in a steady state the toroidal rotation is determined by the balance among the torque, the viscosity, the friction with neutrals and the loss of momentum due to charge exchange. 1...|$|R
40|$|Abstract-Due to {{its special}} structure, the shaft <b>radial</b> force and <b>torque</b> of {{three-phase}} 12 / 8 switched reluctance motors can be independently controlled by proper distribution of currents at each pole of the excited phase, Radial force control {{is useful in}} balancing: 1) external force acting on the motor shaft, and 2) the imbalanced shaft force due to rotor eccentricity, so as to reduce motor vibrations. In this paper, the <b>radial</b> force and <b>torque</b> produced by the SRM under sinusoidal excitations are analyzed, and a scheme to produce the desired radial force is proposed. It was found that when excited with sinusoidal currents, the SRM can generate the desired shaft radial force in any direction in the rotational plane without interfering with the rotational torque.

40|$|Abstract—In general, {{unbalanced}} {{radial force}} acting on rotor shaft is undesirable since it causes vibrations. Due to its special structure, the shaft <b>radial</b> force and <b>torque</b> of a three-phase 12 / 8 {{switched reluctance motor}} can be separately controlled by proper selection of pole currents of the energized phase. In this paper, a sinusoidal current excitation scheme is proposed for the <b>torque</b> and <b>radial</b> force control of a 12 / 8 pole SRM. When controlled with the selected sinusoidal currents the SRM can produce the desired shaft radial force in any direction of the rotational plane without disrupting the rotational torque. Also, since the pole currents are individually controlled a more sophisticated phase commutation strategy is proposed for smoother <b>torque</b> and <b>radial</b> force ripples. The proposed schemes were verified experimentally...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{influence}} of large-scale magnetic fields {{on the structure}} of accretion disks is studied. The magnetic field is obtained by a self-consistent nonlinear dynamo model with magnetic pressure strongly influencing the density stratification which itself feeds back to the field generation. The resulting magnetic field geometry is discussed in relation to the accretion disk wind theory. Regarding new results of MHD turbulence simulations, both possible signs of the α-effect are allowed (Brandenburg & Donner 1997). In the canonical case of positive α the resulting field is of quadrupolar symmetry. The field strength is about 50 % of the value for dynamo models nonlinearly limited by α-quenching. The temperature profiles as well as the disk geometry remain nearly unchanged. The viscous stress remains the key transporter of angular momentum driving the accretion inflow. For negative α, however, a stationary dipolar structure of the magnetic field results. The additional magnetic torque at the disk surface changes the profile of the effective temperature significantly to a profile which is more flat. The magnetic torque becomes of the same order as the <b>radial</b> viscous <b>torque.</b> The inclination angle of the poloidal field exceeds 30 ◦ even for a magnetic Prandtl number of order unity, and also the criterion for poloidal collimation after Spruit et al. (1997) is fulfilled. The dynamo-generated magnetic field configuration thus supports the magnetic wind launching concept for accretion disks for realistic turbulent magnetic Prandtl numbers.

40|$|AbstractOur aim was {{to compare}} an SRM® torque {{analysis}} system with a strain gauge instrumented pedals system for right and left peak crank torque, crank angle of peak torque and power output. Seven competitive cyclists performed an incremental test to exhaustion on a stationary cycle ergometer equipped with an SRM® torque analysis system and a strain gauge instrumented pedals system (SGI pedals). The SRM® torque analysis system measured net torque while the SGI pedals measured the normal and anterior-posterior force applied on the pedal surface. Forces on the pedal surface were resolved into forces on the cranks (tangential and <b>radial).</b> Crank <b>torque</b> {{was measured by the}} pedals using the tangential force on the cranks and crank length. Power output was calculated from crank torque and angular velocity of the crank (calculated from pedalling cadence). All data were acquired between the 20 th and the 40 th seconds of each stage of the incremental test. Magnitudes of differences between outputs from the SGI pedals and the SRM® torque analysis system were assessed by effect sizes. Power output was higher for the SRM® torque analysis system than the SGI pedals. Peak torques were lower for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The angle of the right and left peak torque increased for the SRM® torque analysis system compared to the SGI pedals. The SRM® torque analysis system overestimated power output, underestimated peak torque and increased the angle of peak torque compared to the SGI pedals. Where possible a strain gauge instrumented pedals system should be used to measure performance variables of cyclists rather than the SRM® torque analysis system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an investigation into}} the effects of fluid bulk modulus and traction coefficient properties on piston pump flow losses and <b>radial</b> pison motor <b>torque</b> losses through experimentation, modelling and simulation. Synthetic ester, high bulk modulus, multi-grade, and single grade mineral oils were evaluated. The high bulk modulus fluid exhibited 20 % lower pump case and compensator flow losses than a conventional mineral oil of the same viscosity grade. Low traction coefficient fluids reduced the lowspeed torque losses of the radial piston motor by 50 %. Physical models for pump case flow and motor torque losses were derived from the experimental data. Field data was collected from a hydraulically propelled agricultural machine. This data was used to model fluid performance in the machine. The simulation results predict that at an operating temperature of 80 ⁰C, optimizing the bulk modulus and traction coefficients of the fluid could reduce flow losses by 18 % and torque losses by 5 %. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining comprehensive fluid analysis with modeling and simulation to optimize fluids for the efficient transmission of power...|$|R

The half-coiled short-pitch windings can supply the odd and even harmonics simultaneously, which can be applied in multiphase bearingless motor (MBLM). The space harmonic distribution of the half-coiled short-pitch windings with two kinds of phase belt is studied wi th respect to different coil pitch, and the suitable coil pitch can be selected from the analysis results to reduce the additional <b>radial</b> force and <b>torque</b> pulse. The two kinds of half-coiled short-pitch windings are applied to the five- and six-phase bearingless motor, and the comparation from the Finite Element Method (FEM) results shows that the winding with 2 π/m phase belt is fit for the five phase bearingless motor and the winding with π/m phase belt is suitable for the six phase bearingless motor. Finally, a five phase surface-mounted permanent magnet (PM) bearingless motor is built and the experimental results are presented to verify the validity and feasibility of the analysis.

40|$|Tennis Elbow or Lateral Epicondylalgia is {{manifested}} by pain {{over the region}} of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus, related to use of the wrist extensor muscles. Extensor carpi radialis longus (ECRL) and brevis (ECRB) have been implicated in the dysfunction associated with Lateral Epicondylalgia. For muscles in the human forearm, particularly those in close proximity, selective recordings are nearly impossible without the use of fine wire, indwelling electrodes. These can be inserted in precise locations and have small recording areas. Standard electromyography texts indicate, however, that the activity of ECRL and ECRB cannot be distinguished, even with intramuscular electrodes. We present a new technique for determining the most appropriate sites at which to insert intramuscular electrodes for selective recordings of ECRB and ECRL, The location of ECRB and ECRL was measured on 10 cadaver specimens, 5 right arms and 5 left arms. The distance from the muscle origin to (1) insertion, (2) largest portion of the muscle belly, (3) most proximal fibres and (4) most distal fibres were measured and expressed relative to forearm length. The mean distance and 95 % confidence interval was calculated {{for each of the four}} measures. These data indicated a significant separation of the belly of each muscle along the length of the forearm. These relative distances were used to mark electrode insertion points on three volunteers. Fine wire electrodes were used to record the electromyogram in three participants. Each participant was required to perform isometric contractions to produce (1) wrist extension <b>torque,</b> (2) <b>radial</b> deviation <b>torque,</b> (3) elbow flexion torque and (4) finger extension. The electromyographic recordings show clear differentiation of ECRB and ECRL with the relative activation patterns reflecting the underlying anatomical organisation of the two muscles. This technique provides an important objective method that can be used in conjunction with manual muscle testing to provide a means of ensuring accurate intramuscular electromyographic recording from these two muscles.

40|$|Straightforward {{algebraic}} expressions {{describing the}} elastic wavefield {{produced by a}} line source of finite length are derived in circular cylindrical coordinates. The surrounding elastic medium {{is assumed to be}} both homogeneous and isotropic, anc[the source stress distribution is considered axisymmetic. The time- and space-domain formulae are accurate at all distances and directions from the source; no fa-field or long-wavelength assumptions are adopted for the derivation. The mathematics yield a unified treatment of three different types of sources: an axial torque, an axial force, and a <b>radial</b> pressure. The <b>torque</b> source radiates only azirnuthally polarized shear waves, whereas force and pressure sources generate simultaneous compressional and shear radiation polarized in planes containing the line source. The formulae reduce to more familiar expressions in the two limiting cases where the length of the line source approaches zero and infinity. Far-field approximations to the exact equations indicate that waves radiated parallel to the line source axI. s are attenuated relative to those radiated normal to the axis. The attenuation is more severe for higher I?equencies and for lower wavespeeds. Hence, shear waves are affected more than compressional waves. This fi-equency- and directiondependent attenuation is characterized by an extremely simple mathematical formula, and is readily apparent in example synthetic seismograms...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} radial {{migration}} of dust particles in accreting protostellar disks {{analogous to the}} primordial solar nebula. This study takes account of the two dimensional (radial and normal) structure of the disk gas, including {{the effects of the}} variation in the gas velocity as a function of distance from the midplane. It is shown that the dust component of disks accretes slower than the gas component. At high altitude from the disk midplane, the gas rotates faster than particles because of the inward pressure gradient force, and its drag force causes particles to move outward in the <b>radial</b> direction. Viscous <b>torque</b> induces the gas within a scale height from the disk midplane to flow outward, carrying small (size 1 mm at 10 AU) move inward. When the particles' radial velocities are averaged over the entire vertical direction, particles have a net inward flux. At large distances from the central star, particles migrate inward with a velocity much faster than the gas accretion velocity. However, their inward velocity is reduced below that of the gas in the inner regions of the disk. The rate of velocity decrease {{is a function of the}} particles' size. While larger particles retain fast accretion velocity until they approach closer to the star, 10 micron particles have slower velocity than the gas in the most part of the disk (r < 100 AU). This differential migration of particles causes the size fractionation. Dust disks composed mostly of small particles (size < 10 micron) accrete slower than gas disks, resulting in the increase in the dust-gas ratio during the gas accretion phase.

40|$|About {{half of all}} {{scientific}} and commercial spacecraft spin during some part of their mission. Although spinning has many benefits (increasing stability, controlling the location of liquid propellants, and distributing solar heat loads), it also creates problems because a precession (or wobble) motion is unavoidable. For modern spacecraft, {{by far the largest}} source of wobble is energy dissipation in the liquid of partially filled tanks. The liquid s energy dissipation cannot, however, be quantified adequately by any ground test. Current analytical models are also inadequate because fundamental data on fluid motion in low gravity are needed to validate them. Consequently, spacecraft attitude-control systems are designed and operated very conservatively. Nonetheless, spacecraft often still perform poorly in orbit, and some have been lost because of a rapid increase of the wobble rate. The Liquid Motion Experiment (LME) was designed to provide spacecraft designers accurate data on the wobble dynamics of spacecraft that contain large quantities of mobile liquids. LME, which was flown on the space shuttle mission STS- 84, was built under contract to the NASA Lewis Research Center by the Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas. Major accomplishments for 1998 include reduction of the flight data and publication of the experimental results. LME was essentially a spin table that created a realistic nutation motion of scale-model tanks containing liquid. Two spherical and two cylindrical transparent tanks were tested simultaneously, and three sets of such tanks were employed to vary liquid viscosity, fill level, and propellant management device (PMD) design. All the tanks were approximately 4. 5 in. in diameter. The primary test measurements were the <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>torques</b> exerted on the tanks by the liquid. These torques could not be measured on the ground because of the masking effects of gravity...|$|R
40|$|Abridged) We {{investigate}} how galactic disks react to external tidal torques. We calculate {{the strength and}} <b>radial</b> dependence of <b>torques</b> on disks that arise from a misalignment between the disk and the main axis system of a flattened dark matter halo. We find that except for in the very inner regions, the torques are well-described by a power law of the form τ∝ r^- 2. 5. The magnitude of the torque is large enough for the entire disk {{to react to the}} torque in less than the Hubble time. We demonstrate analytically that disks which are originally located in the xy-plane and which are subjected to a torque around the x-axis tilt around the y-axis, as also found in fully non-linear N-body simulations. We further demonstrate that that the torque causes the radius of a chosen particle to increase with time. Investigations of tilting disks which treat the disk as a set of solid rings thus may systematically overestimate the effects of the torque by a factor of two. For torques of the form we investigate, the inner regions of the disk react to the torque faster than the outer regions, resulting in a trailing warp. We then study the effect of the self-gravity of the disk in such a scenario using numerical N-body models. Self-gravity flattens out the inner regions of the disk, but these regions are tilted with respect to their initial plane followed by a non-flat outer region whose tilt decreases with radius. The "warp radius," which marks the end of the inner flat disk, grows throughout the disk at a rate that depends only on the strength of the torque and the local surface density of the disk.

TWo spherical and two cylindrical transparent tanks were tested simultaneously, and three sets of such tanks were employed to vary liquid viscosity, fill level, and propellant management device (PMD) design. All the tanks were approximately 4. 5 inches diameter. The primary test measurements were the <b>radial</b> and tangential <b>torques</b> exerted on the tanks by the liquid. Resonant frequencies and damping of the liquid oscillations were determined by sine sweep tests. For a given tank shape, the resonant frequency depended on fill level. For the cylindrical tanks, the resonances had somewhat different frequencies for the tangential axis (0. 55 to 0. 75 times spin rate) and the radial axis (0. 73 to 0. 78 times spin rate), and the tangential axis resonance agreed more closely with available analytical models. For the spherical tanks, the resonant frequencies were between 0. 74 to 0. 77 times the spin rate and were the same for the tangential and radial axes. The damping coefficients varied from about I% to 3 % of critical, depending on tank shape, fill level, and liquid viscosity. 'Me viscous energy dissipation rates of the liquid oscillations were determined from sine dwell tests. The LME energy dissipation rates varied from 0. 3 to 0. 5 times the estimates obtained from scaling previous ground tests and spacecraft flight data. The PNDs sometimes enhanced the resonances and energy dissipation rates and sometimes decreased them, which points out the need to understand better the effects of PMD on liquid motion as a function of PMD and tank design...|$|R
40|$|Operating {{characteristics}} of modern multi-axle off-road vehicles {{allow them to}} overcome successfully various engineering structures such as ditches, trenches, embankments, etc. A theoretical study of the transmission loading process under these conditions requires knowledge of {{characteristics of}} all power train elements, {{including those of the}} tire when it contacts the plane and large bump. The paper presents research results of wide-section tire characteristics of the model I- 247 (1200 x 500 - 508) on the long length bumps under static loading by <b>radial</b> force and <b>torque</b> at the internal air pressure in the tire of 0. 35, 0. 20, and 0. 05 MPa. The research has been conducted on a special stand. As the bumps, were used two triangular prisms with the rounding vertex angles of 120 ° and 90 ° having radius of 100 mm. The threshold bumps were used as well. Their sizes were selected so that in all measuring options a tire was in contact with bump. The nature of tires load behavior on the bumps with radial and angular deformation and in contact with the plane, essentially, does not differ. With such shapes and sizes of bumps a contact surface appearance has less impact on the tire torsion stiffness than on the radial one. Thus, at a nominal internal tire pressure of 0. 35 MPa, a torsion stiffness of the tire is decreased, in average, by 5 %, while the radial one is reduced by 25 % when there is a transition from the contact on the plane to the contact with bumps. It should be noted that at the transition from the plane contact to the that of with bumps the limit values of the tire radial stiffness ratio are significantly reduced, namely: up to 50 % at internal tire pressure of 0. 20 and 0. 35 MPa, and up to 71 % at internal tire pressure of 0. 05 MPa. The results of experimental research enable the following mathematical modeling: full approximation of tire load characteristics in case of instability of its smoothing a single bump; maximum loads and calculation of load modes of units and systems when a vehicle overcomes engineering structures and large bumps, taking into account the nonlinear features of tire behavior in its radial and torsion deformation. </p...|$|R
