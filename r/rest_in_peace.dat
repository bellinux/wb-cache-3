To help guard against this impression Missouri was placed well back from and facing the Arizona Memorial, so that those participating in military ceremonies on Missouris aft decks would not have sight of the Arizona Memorial. The decision to have Missouris bow face the Arizona Memorial was intended to convey that Missouri watches over the remains of Arizona so that those interred within Arizonas hull may <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>peace.</b>|$|E

When he was a child, Sasori's parents were killed by Sakumo Hatake, {{also known as the}} White Fang of Konoha, leaving him in the care of his grandmother, Chiyo who taught Sasori the art of puppetry, which he refined to fit his needs over the years. However, motivated by his desire to make works that last forever, Sasori secretly devised a way to convert the corpses of humans into puppets, allowing him to use any of the ninja abilities they possessed during their lives for himself. Leaving Sunagakure in his teenage, Sasori later kidnapped the Third Kazekage, transforming him into a human puppet and using him as his main weapon. Sasori's desire was to become art, so he converted his own body into a puppet, which essentially gives him eternal life and allows him to control hundreds of puppets at once. After joining the Akatsuki, Sasori was paired with Orochimaru, and after his desertion, he was teamed with Deidara, who looks up to him and his artistic knowledge with reverence. [...] In the Akatsuki, Sasori spent most of the time hidden inside Hiruko, a human puppet who served as both weapon and armour, which he adorned with Akatsuki's robe. After him and Deidara kidnap Gaara, Sasori ends up having a fight against Sakura and Chiyo, which resulted in the destruction of his heart, the only part of his humanity he kept when converting himself to a puppet, resulting in his death, but not before telling Sakura about his rendezvous with one of Orochimaru's henchmen who had been working for him as a spy. After being resurrected by Kabuto, Sasori fights Kankuro who convinces him to be at peace with himself. Sasori comes to terms with his life and is finally able to pass on and <b>rest</b> <b>in</b> <b>peace.</b> In the Japanese anime, Sasori is voiced by Akiko Yajima as a child and by Takahiro Sakurai as an adult.
