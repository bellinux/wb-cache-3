Some character designs were created with the Super Famicom hardware limitations in mind: Kaneko designed three different poses for the Twelve Heavenly Generals, which were combined in various ways with graphics for different heads and held items, along with different color palettes, resulting in twelve different combinations. He thought this acceptable as the generals were a group, and were meant to look cohesive.|$|E

50|$|In Central Africa, Ndembu warriors rub {{themselves}} with red paint during celebrations.

Like most Central African cultures, the Ndembu see red as ambivalent, better than black but not as good as white. In other parts of Africa, however, red is a color of mourning, representing death. Because <b>red</b> <b>bears</b> are associated with death in many parts of Africa, the Red Cross has changed its colors to green and white in parts of the continent.|$|R

The third time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a fall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great <b>red</b> <b>bear,</b> which was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. The beast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at its terrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and rushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bears were near.|$|E
