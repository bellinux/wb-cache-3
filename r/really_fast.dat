40|$|In the Netherlands the {{meningococcal}} serogroup C conjugate (MenCC) {{vaccine is}} administered {{as a single}} dose at 14 months. We evaluated the kinetics of isotype-specific antibodies in adults (n = 21) after primary immunization with MenCC or secondary immunization with MenCC or plain MenC polysaccharide vaccine. Blood samples were collected prior to immunization and at 6 additional time points, from 3 to 25 days post-immunization. Secondary immunization resulted in 5 - 10 -fold higher IgG titers compared to the primary immunization group, 25 days post-immunization. Prior to the secondary immunization, but 5 {{years after the first}} immunization, protective bactericidal antibodies and levels of MenC-specific IgG and IgM were still present. Furthermore, IgG antibodies present before secondary immunization were of higher avidity compared to antibodies produced one month after primary immunization. in addition, secondary immunization with nonconjugated MenC polysaccharide seemed to induce a higher IgG 2 response compared to MenCC immunization. The kinetics of the observed secondary immune responses were not <b>really</b> <b>faster</b> than the observed primary responses. However, the rate of increase in antibodies seemed faster than the primary responses, representing a booster response. As the course of infection by Neisseria meningitidis can be very rapid, these data support the idea that sustainment of high antibody levels induced by MenCC are important for immediate protection.

500|$|The {{film was}} shot using the video mode of two Canon EOS 5D Mark II and one Canon EOS 1D Mark IV digital single-lens reflex cameras, which helped the filmmakers {{look more like}} typical park visitors. To {{compensate}} for their inability to control the lighting, the film was shot in monochrome mode. [...] "e were shooting with <b>really</b> <b>fast</b> lenses wide open, so our depth of field was razor thin. Black and white helped us enormously with focus and composition, since we were doing almost everything in camera and didn't use a focus puller," [...] Moore recalled. It was an irreversible choice. [...] "ecause the 5D doesn't shoot RAW, we customized settings in its monochromatic mode and couldn't go back to color, {{even if we had}} wanted to." [...] Moore was comfortable with the result because of the surrealistic, dreamlike quality it created, forcing viewers to see the familiar sights of the Disney parks in a new way.|$|E

Then [...] we played it like punk rock, <b>really</b> <b>fast,</b> as well as country and funky. You know, you get a song and put clothes on it to see what looks good and what doesn't, and usually when you find the right one it's pretty obvious. With that song it was real obvious!"

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} {{a framework of}} simulation environment (SEMU) which allows developers to understand the behavior of applications or protocols for a wireless sensor network (WSN) before deploying real nodes in a physical environment. For eliminating the gap between simulation and real deployment, SEMU has supported fast real code emulation by dynamic binary translation technique. SEMU also models the controlled environment as virtual operating system (Virtual OS) to coordinate the interactions of large number of nodes. In addition, we have proposed a co-simulation model to enhance the accuracy of pure software simulation. Then a further synchronization problem will be addressed and resolved by the co-simulation model. The evaluation results show SEMU is <b>really</b> a <b>fast</b> scalable WSN simulator with real code emulation.

500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team.

The Pac-10 schools wanted him to walk-on, rather than be actively recruited or offered a sports scholarship. Harvard and Brown were the only teams that guaranteed him a spot on their basketball teams, but Ivy League schools do not offer athletic scholarships. Rex Walters, University of San Francisco men's basketball coach and retired NBA player, said NCAA limits on coaches' recruiting visits had reduced Lin's chances.

Elutriates from Guanabara Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) sediments has been tested, in order to define its general acute toxicity for organisms living into its or in the overlying water body. FHBM 24 assay can quantify: i) inhibition rate of mitochondrial respiration (measured as oxygen consumption) and ii) the eventual presence of uncoupling compounds. Obtained results clearly showed similar responses from sediments coming from same sampling sub-area. Moreover, alternative use of EDTA or albumine in the assay medium with the elutriates tested, permitted to distinguish respectively heavy metal’s or organic’s action and toxicity load. These information very well match together to chemical analysis of sediments and the corresponding Sediment Quality Guidelines application. Then, we proposed this bioassay like {{a part of a}} battery of ecotoxicological tests...|$|R
