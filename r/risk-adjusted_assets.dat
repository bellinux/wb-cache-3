40|$|The {{efficient}} market hypothesis implies that (<b>risk-adjusted)</b> <b>asset</b> prices cannot be cointegrated. On the other hand, arbitrage processes prevent prices of fundamentally related assets from drifting too far away. An attractive model that reconciles these two conflicting facts is the non-linear error correction mechanism (ECM). Such a process tolerates small {{deviations from the}} long-run relationship. For more substantial deviations, an effective adjustment process pushes the diverging prices towards their fundamental relationship. In this paper parametric and non-parametric techniques are employed to investigate the ECM between prices of voting and non-voting stocks. Despite its intuitive appeal, we find little evidence for a non-linear relationship between German dual-class shares. Only in four out of 12 cases does the threshold ECM yield a substantial improvement of fit. In other cases, the evidence for non-linearity is rather weak and the threshold ECM fails to outperform the linear model. Copyright Verein fü Socialpolitik and Blackwell Publishers Ltd 2001. ...|$|R
30|$|As an {{extension}} of this view of loan portfolios, Real Options Theory allows for valuing strategies to either extend or idle the portfolio through the information that an option premium provides. A put option premium (the strategy to idle or even contract the portfolio) results from {{the difference between the}} salvage value of the loan, and the expected value of any inflows from the loan. The premium of a call option (the strategy to lend) results from the difference between the <b>risk-adjusted</b> underlying <b>asset</b> (the inflows resulting from the loan portfolio), and that of any outflows (essentially sunk costs), to gain rights to the underlying asset (Yoon and Smith 2002).|$|R
50|$|All {{banks are}} {{required}} to hold {{a certain percentage of}} their assets as capital, a rate which may be established by the central bank or the banking supervisor. For international banks, including the 55 member central banks of the Bank for International Settlements, the threshold is 8% (see the Basel Capital Accords) of <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>assets,</b> whereby certain assets (such as government bonds) are considered to have lower risk and are either partially or fully excluded from total assets for the purposes of calculating capital adequacy. Partly due to concerns about asset inflation and repurchase agreements, capital requirements may be considered more effective than reserve requirements in preventing indefinite lending: when at the threshold, a bank cannot extend another loan without acquiring further capital on its balance sheet.|$|E

40|$|The {{asset price}} channel {{focuses on the}} {{relative}} prices {{of a wide range}} of assets in the transmission of monetary impulses on the financial and real capital markets. If monetary impulses are already fading on the financial markets, then their effectiveness in terms of economic policy targets has to be questioned. A missing tendency towards a long-run equilibrium relationship in the observable yield rates on the financial markets is often attributed to non-stationary risk premiums underlying the financial assets. In this paper a cointegration model for the risk-adjusted yields of the money market, market for bank credit and the bonds market is developed for the monetary policy regime of a money supply target in the Federal Republic of Germany for the period 1980 - 1998.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{empirical}} {{counterpart of}} a theory of asset prices {{is a model of}} the cross-section of security returns. Empirical tests of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) of Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965), Mossin (1966) and Black (1972) using cross-sectional methodologies have identiﬁed numerous cases where variables apart from beta explain expected returns. Initially termed 'anomalies', these empirical violations of the theory are frequently associated with ﬁrm-speciﬁc attribute data. Traditional views of market efﬁciency however rule out the ability to predict <b>risk-adjusted</b> <b>asset</b> returns and the source and exploitability of these anomalies remains controversial. This thesis empirically investigates the cross-sectional relationship between twenty-four ﬁrm-speciﬁc attributes and stock returns on the JSE Securities Exchange (JSE). The results are evaluated to determine whether they conform to the predictions of the CAPM and a two factor Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) model suggested by prior research. In monthly univariate tests similar to Fama and MacBeth (1973), price-to-NAV, dividend yield, price-to-earnings, cashflow-to-price, price-to-proﬁt and size are found to have statistically signiﬁcant predictive power in the cross-section of returns using monthly data from July 1990 to June 2000. After conducting risk-adjustments using both the CAPM and a two factor APT model these effects are found to persist. Multivariate testing suggests a two factor model with the size and price-to-earnings attributes as explanatory variables. When the cross-sectional tests are compared across the broad industry sectors of the JSE, value effects are observed as being stronger in the ﬁnancial-industrial sector than in the resource sector, the small size effect is roughly the same across sectors while the premium earned by higher debt levels is negative across all sectors except the ﬁnancial sector. The results are not reconcilable with the predictions of the CAPM. Simulated portfolios constructed using a methodology similar to Fama and French (1992) reveal that beta, if anything, is inversely related to average returns on the JSE. Contrary to the international evidence, greater average returns accruing to small and low price-to- earnings ﬁrms are not commensurate with higher betas. Controlling for the small size and low price-to-earnings effects does not improve the explanatory power of beta. An application of the Daniel and Titman (1997) methodology suggests that average returns on the JSE are not compensation for factor risk, but instead are associated with the exposure to the attributes themselves. The ﬁndings of this study present a serious empirical challenge for covariance-based asset pricing models on the JSE...|$|R

50|$|Deflation is {{also related}} to risk aversion. Where the <b>risk-adjusted</b> return on <b>assets</b> drops to near zero (or even negative), investors and buyers will hoard {{currency}} rather than invest it, {{even in the most}} solid of securities. This can produce a liquidity trap or it may lead to shortages that entice investments yielding more jobs and commodity production. A central bank cannot, normally, charge negative interest for money, and even charging zero interest often produces less stimulative effect than slightly higher rates of interest. In a closed economy, this is because charging zero interest also means having zero return on government securities, or even negative return on short maturities. In an open economy it creates a carry trade, and devalues the currency. A devalued currency produces higher prices for imports without necessarily stimulating exports to a like degree.|$|R

Using a grounded theory approach, 29 {{interviews were conducted}} with relationship managers and corporate banking directors in 21 case banks from 2004 to 2008.

40|$|Doctor of PhilosophyThe {{management}} of credit risk attitude in Australian retail banks is {{examined in this}} thesis. An underlying query is why retail banks repeatedly have been “economically irrational” in managing credit risk across numerous credit cycles. The period of study is 1996 - 1999 - characterised by a benign economy, intense competition and technological/analytical innovations. Initially, the theory of credit rationing, which is an economic construct, is examined. Subsequent {{analysis of the data}} uses models from the theories of decision making under uncertainty (particularly prospect theory), organisational culture/climate and the Balanced Scorecard. Based on the grounded theory approach, the largely exploratory research incorporates data, theory and methodological triangulation. The research design includes individual interviews, focus groups and one questionnaire, with participants including Senior Credit Managers and Lending Officers. Several models are developed. The multi-level model of “credit culture” is created to incorporate: Organisation culture, which resides at the subconscious, enduring “assumptions” level; Credit principles/culture, which resides at the relatively enduring “values” level and is the credit functions’ interpretation of organisation culture; Credit risk attitude, which is the Senior Credit Managers’ weighting of the credit risk versus income reward tradeoff at a point in time; and Credit infrastructure/climate, which resides at the behavioural level and operationalises the credit risk attitude through the controls and disciplines by which credit risk is managed throughout the organisation. The overall model of credit risk attitude across the business cycle incorporates the phases of shock/remorse, resolve, cautious optimism and disaster myopia. The drivers of credit risk attitude model highlights the tradeoff between revenue growth and the visibility of credit losses (particularly the availability, threshold and representativeness heuristics). The Credit Confidence Survey measures the credit standards currently being applied. The Balanced Credit Scorecard provides a performance measurement framework with the dimensions of credit principles, policy, risk management methods, business processes/systems, staffing and controls. Additional heuristics/ motivators affecting individual and group decisions also are outlined. A primary conclusion of the research is that retail credit managers benefit from using advanced risk management techniques to maximise the <b>risk-adjusted</b> return on <b>assets,</b> whilst maintaining non-volatile losses within the FI’s risk appetite...|$|R
40|$|This {{collection}} of seven papers deals {{with three different}} areas of econometric applications. The papers apply techniques related {{to the analysis of}} unit roots and cointegration methods. The first paper deals with consumption theories and formulates an error-correction forecasting model for consumption. A single cointegration relationship is found between consumption, income and net wealth, which is in line with the permanent income hypothesis. The second paper studies the excess sensitivity of consumption to current disposable income. Estimating the coefficient with time-varying techniques, we notice a decline in the coefficient during the period of financial deregulation {{toward the end of the}} 1980 s and a rise during the recession. Third paper takes a closer look at how useful consumer barometer variables can be in forecasting variables such as consumption and inflation. First paper on asset prices, is based on the theory of cointegration between house and stock prices, which asserts that real after-tax <b>risk-adjusted</b> returns on <b>assets</b> should coincide in the long run. This paper presents a model for house prices that uses stock prices as a leading indicator to improve the forecasting of housing prices. Another paper on asset prices considers cointegration between house prices and inflation, and finds eg that house prices adjust to consumer prices in the long run and that no excess real appreciation, apart from rental income, is derived from house ownership. The two last papers deal with bankruptcy forecasting and testing for nonlinearities and chaos. It is asserted that bankruptcies can be interpreted as error-correction between supply and demand. Many tests have been developed to study the presence of nonlinearities in economic series. The results of testing unambiguously support that there are strong nonlinearities in economic data, but the evidence for chaos is weak. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|Fund {{investments}} are {{very popular in}} Sweden. However, we have the impression that despite this popularity, the average fund investor in Sweden does not {{pay much attention to}} the importance and possible link of fund’s asset composition features (e. g. Asset class, Holdings, and Geo-exposure) to fund’s performance. Instead, S/he relies on factors such as fees, risk levels, historical performance, etc. in her/his investment decisions. Similarly, academic studies mainly focus on attributes such as funds fees, size, and manager’s skill to explain fund’s performance. Thus there are limited premier academic studies on the relationship between fund’s performance and its asset composition features. The main {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate possible causal relationship between the performances of funds with their assets composition features. We study the whole population of 346 Swedish listed mutual funds older than five years for the period 2009 - 2013. The results of the study provides the investors and analysts with additional decision-making and investment-analysis tools to assist them in making more informed judgment on funds and their expected returns. The results are also useful for fund managers to improve their strategies by refining the combinations of their funds’ asset composition attributes in order to improve the absolute risk-adjusted performance of their funds. Our research philosophy has been based on positivism and objectivism along with functionalist paradigm and we have applied deductive approach to test the theories. We have used quantitative method and collected the funds’ data from public business databases and chosen Jensen’s alpha and Treynor ratio as funds’ risk-adjusted performance measures. We performed Correlation tests and Regression with robust techniques on our data to answer the research question from three aspects, namely asset class (equity, bond, and mixed assets); geo-exposures (Sweden, Global, Europe, and Nordic) and Top-ten holdings’ measures (asset concentration and Treynor of each fund’s passive top-ten sub-portfolio). We conclude that correlations between funds’ <b>risk-adjusted</b> performance and <b>assets</b> composition features are likely to exist. Stronger correlations are observed between the explanatory measures and fund’s relative risk-adjusted performance (fund’s Treynor) as compared to fund’s absolute risk adjusted performance (fund’s Jensen’s alpha). Asset concentration in top-ten holdings and bond asset class are more likely to be in casual relationship with fund’s risk-adjusted performance, whereas Treynor ratio of top-ten holdings’ passive sub-portfolio as well as fund’s geo-exposure do not seem to have strong explanatory power for funds’ absolute performance...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the trend}} of {{internationalization}} and deregulation, American commercial banks face intensive competition from not only domestic competitors, but also banks around the world. To improve the performance and competitiveness of American banks in the global financial market, the U. S. government passed the Financial Service Modernization Act (the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) that permitted American banks to provide various types of financial services. This paper first investigates the efficiency change of American banks {{before and after the}} Act became effective in 1999. A non-parametric approach, data envelopment analysis (DEA), is employed to measure relative efficiency, and the results show that the efficiency after the Act is not as good as expected and even worse than before. Next, this paper further compares the performance of 81 American banks with that of 70 Japanese banks for the period of 2000 - 2004 by performing DEA and MPI. The empirical results show that, on average, the performance of Japanese commercial banks is significantly better than that of American banks and that increasing returns to scale (IRS) is the most probable state of the banking industry in both countries. Furthermore, Japanese banks experienced productivity improvement and the mean productivity for American banks decreased during 2000 - 2004. However, the productivity changes (MPI) of American banks become better {{at the end of the}} sample period. Finally, this paper analyzes the efficiency drivers for American banks. Fee revenue, Return on <b>Asset,</b> <b>risk-adjusted</b> capital adequacy ratio, scale, and total loans are considered to be the relevant factors, which drive bank's efficiency.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} federal tax {{exemption}} for credit unions. It reviews the industry’s history, its unique exemption, the motivation behind this tax treatment, the eroding case for special treatment, {{the size of the}} tax break and its effects on credit unions, their competitors, and their members. The nation’s credit unions always have been exempt from federal income taxation. Federally chartered credit unions are even exempt from state and local income taxation. Saving and loan associations, also originally largely exempt from taxation, lost their exemption on 1951 and calls for tax reform, including those of former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, included provisions to end the special exemptions of credit unions. But the credit union tax exemptions have survived. At least in part, these exemptions arose from the cooperative nature of credit union ownership and limits on their ability to compete because of their legal “field of membership” restrictions, which limited who could be a depositor and borrower from a credit union. Nonetheless, credit unions have competed with other financial institutions, especially banks, with a major cost advantage, the tax exemption. Tax exemption has allowed credit unions to grow much more rapidly than banks. Unusual growth was also fostered by steady erosion of limits on credit union membership over the past two decades. In 1998, the US Supreme Court struck down the liberalization of membership rules, but the US Congress promptly passed new legislation overriding the court. As a result the processes of consolidation, merger and broadening of geographic markets accelerated while credit unions were allowed to keep their tax exemptions. Thus, Congress created new tensions by weakening the case for tax exemption without addressing its continuing legitimacy. Today credit unions continue to grow faster than banks, have little practical limitations on membership, make business loans that increasingly have no limits on who can borrow, how much or for what purpose. Even the limits that Congress imposed, as they otherwise removed limits on credit union markets and competition, have broad loopholes and remain under serious challenge by the credit union industry. The tax loss to the federal Treasury is estimated here to be $ 2 billion and to be growing rapidly. Indeed, the tax loss over the five years, 2004 - 2008 is estimated to be $ 12. 6 billion and reaches $ 31. 3 billion over the ten-year window 2005 - 2014. The size of the tax loss is substantially higher than estimates prepared by official arbiters including the Office of Management and Budget or the Congressional Budget Office. The annual loss in tax revenue could accrue to several different credit union constituencies: members, as depositors (higher “dividends,” or interest rates, on their “shares,” or deposits), borrowers (lower interest rates on loans), or shareholders (through greater retained earnings). The benefits of the tax break could also accrue to management, workers or other suppliers through inflated costs or inefficient operations. Based on other studies of differences between credit unions and banks and on direct and indirect evidence gathered for this study, it is found that the principal effect of the tax break is to enlarge the retained earnings or equity of the credit union industry. A higher ratio of equity to assets has made possible a larger and faster growing industry than would otherwise have been possible. There is some evidence that certain type loans have lower rates at credit unions. These are for loans that have become less profitable and less available at banks, such as auto loans. There is also some evidence that part of the tax advantage is absorbed by higher costs than they would have in a taxed, or more competitive, environment. Overall the dominant effect is to boost the equity ratio. Over the past ten years, credit unions have had an equity ratio, the ratio of equity to total assets that is more than 25 percent larger than that of banks. This {{is about the size of}} effect predicted by economic theory if the dominant effect of the tax break is to raise this measure. The equity ratio is a cushion against losses in asset value that could threaten the solvency of a financial institution. It is also a constraint on growth because a relatively safe institution cannot allow its assets to grow faster than its equity if it is holding its desired equity ratio. Despite the fact that the risk of credit union assets, largely shorter term consumer loans and consumer mortgages, is much smaller than the risks of bank assets, which are largely business loans and securities, credit unions hold a higher cushion against risk. These unusually large holding of equity cannot be realized through stock sales by the owners/members of credit unions and they do not yield competitive <b>risk-adjusted</b> yields on <b>assets</b> that they would have to earn if credit unions were subject to the same taxes as banks. Removing the tax exemption would level the playing field, reducing the excessive growth and relative size of credit union assets. It would also raise about $ 2 billion in tax revenue, either directly from credit unions or from more profitable and more highly taxed banks, where credit union deposits and assets would migrate if the tax exemption were ended. Finally it would raise the rate of return on some $ 65 billion of capital that is squirreled away in credit unions, earning lower rates of return than would be the case at taxed banks. Some analysts have argued that small institutions (under $ 10 million in assets) should continue to be tax exempt because of their special character and, perhaps, innate inefficiencies. But the corporate income tax already takes smallness into effect by taxing low-income firms at lower tax rates (15 %, instead of up to 35 % for large firms, or up to 39 percent for mid-sized corporations). ...|$|R
