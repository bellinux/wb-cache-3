40|$|This fall 2000 {{season was}} marked by a very {{westerly}} flavor to the passerine migration with many sightings of western warblers, vireos, and flycatchers in western Nebraska. Most notably, Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireos were seen in good numbers. Additionally, three sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> and five of Dusky Flycatcher added to the excitement. In this note, we report this fall 2 ̆ 7 s sightings of Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> and comment {{on the status of}} this species in Nebraska. On 26 August 2000, Dinsmore observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (Vermivora virginiae) along the north side of Oliver Reservoir. He studied the bird at close range from 9 : 52 - 10 : 05 a. m. as it foraged with a large flock of migrant passerines. The identification of the bird as a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was straightforward. Features noted included the generally dull gray/brown plumage, slightly paler underparts with a very dull yellowish or buff patch {{at the center of the}} breast and bright yellow undertail coverts, conspicuous white eyering. plain, unmarked wings, and the nearly constant sideways flicking of the tail. On the basis of the brown tones to the plumage, dusky underparts, lack of a rufous cap, and only a faint hint of a yellow/buff breast patch, he concluded that the bird was an immature female Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (see Dunn and Garrett 1997). Fontaine saw this individual briefly on 27 August in the same general area. On 27 August 2000, Fontaine observed a Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> along the gravel road South of exit 1 off Interstate 80 in southwestern Kimball County. The bird was seen shortly after sunrise from 6 : 45 - 6 : 50 a. m. foraging in a stand of Limber Pine approximately 15 meters from the roadside. The Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was in the company of a loose flock of migrants composed of Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, and a Brown Thrasher. The bird was seen flicking its tail as it moved from tree to tree. Based on the clean gray breast and bold lemon yellow undertail coverts, he concluded the bird was an adult female...|$|R

It is the authors 2 ̆ 7 opinion that for any record of a MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> in central and eastern Nebraska to be entirely convincing the bird should have in-hand data taken on it or extremely well documentation of multiple field marks, which must include tail length in reference to the body. Reasons are as follows: MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers are characterized by having a broken eyering, although both male and female, adult and immature, Mouring Warblers may have incomplete eyerings (Wood and Beimborm 1981); while MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s have black lores and most Mournings have gray lores, some populations of Mourning Warblers are black lored (Robertson 1980).

40|$|Although {{the impacts}} of {{livestock}} and human activities on riparian zones and associated wildlife have been well documented, {{little is known about}} the impacts that browsing by large native ungulates such as elk and moose may have. In the northern Yellowstone area, some willow stands experience intense browsing by elk and moose whereas others experience medium or very low amounts of browsing. The objectives of this study were (1) to compare the species and densities of birds among willow stands that have experienced different intensities of browsing by native ungulates, (2) to measure the relationship between five species of birds and aspects of habitat structure, and (3) to develop and evaluate predictive models that relate presence or absence of the five species to habitat characteristics.

40|$|Despite this cool, wet spring, warbler enthusiasts {{were thrilled}} {{by one of}} the best showings in years, with Chestnut-sided, Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Mourning Warblers leading the charge. Swallows also as a group arrived early, {{including}} a record early Barn Swallow, and record early Western Tanagers (yes, more than one) appeared, surprisingly, in the east. There were no reports of mortality due to cold or excessive moisture; apparently food sources were unaffected. The large incursion of Purple Finches and the smaller one of Mountain Chickadees continued into the spring period, with impressive totals. Identification of Catharus thrushes is more difficult in the field than field guides might indicate because of the tendency of birds to stay in areas where lighting is inconsistent and often subpar for viewing. Thus reports without details earlier than late April are difficult to evaluate; also adding to the problems this spring was a higher than usual number of Hermit Thrushes. Some exciting rarities were reported; most exciting was Nebraska 2 ̆ 7 s first Grace 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> a bird well-documented with photos. Others were two Black-throated Gray Warblers, a Golden-crowned Sparrow, and several other species considered casual in occurrence.

40|$|INTRODUCTION The {{amount of}} work reporters put into their reports is tremendous. Putting the {{information}} into a readable format which preserves it for future use is a challenge, but always interesting. Reporters can report on their own forms if preferred; some do now, often because of computerized record-keeping systems. I [Ross Silcock] enter the data into my computer, and so almost anything is fine, as long as I can read it. It {{is not necessary to}} list every species, although {{it is difficult to know}} whether your dates of arrival, high counts, etc. are significant until compared with the others submitted. Perhaps the best way to save time and work reporting is to plan your system so that it is simple to report when the time comes. NOTABLE EVENTS There are several highlights among the data presented below. A long list of rarities included Eurasian Wigeon, Oldsquaw, Gyrfalcon, King Rail, Snowy Plover, Red Knot, Ruff (first Nebraska record), Thayer 2 ̆ 7 s Gull, Iceland Gull, Lesser Black-backed Gull, Great Black-backed Gull, Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Nutcracker, Cape May Warbler, Worm-eating Warbler, Connecticut Warbler, MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> (specimen in Lancaster County), Hooded Warbler, and Henslow 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow. American Bittern is doing well in the Sandhills, as is Black-crowned Night-Heron, and especially Black-necked stilt. White-faced Ibis was also numerous, although it is not resident. Trumpeter Swan is present in the Sandhills in good numbers also, with several breeding pairs noted. This year, Cinnamon Teal was also present in good numbers. That these species are doing well speaks for the good condition of Sandhills waterbird habitats...|$|R
40|$|This {{winter was}} pretty much a rerun of last, {{although}} perhaps not as severe; I could have used last winter 2 ̆ 7 s Introduction again. If there was an overall theme, {{it would be the}} widespread occurrences of species that would not be expected to linger into late December and January. Several species of waterbirds, notably Blue-winged Teal, scoters, Ruddy Duck, Common Loon, and Homed and Red-necked Grebes were in this category. Large numbers of Western Grebes were still at Lake McConaughy in early January, and surprisingly late individuals of Black-crowned Night-Heron and Plegadis ibis were located. Mourning Doves were in good numbers in the southeast, and, among passerines, Hermit Thrushes were in good numbers, also. Late surprises among sparrows included Clay-colored, Chipping, and Field. Other daringly late passerines included two (!) Ruby-crowned Kinglets at Ogallala in February, and a Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> in December in Scotts Bluff Co. Things are happening with some woodpeckers; for the second consecutive winter, Yellow-bellied Sapsuckers were everywhere, and Pileateds continue to expand their range northward in the Missouri Valley. This was a great year for Snow Buntings, even better than last year 2 ̆ 7 s good showing. Rarities were scarce; prominent of course was the carryover Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Gull from fall, but almost unbelievable was another Ross 2 ̆ 7 s Gull in Lancaster Co. in early December while the Gavins Point bird was still present. Also a carryover story, but apparently ending sadly, was the Brown-headed Nuthatch saga in Lincoln; 2 birds were last reported in mid-December, and the last sighting {{was at the end of}} January. Otherwise, rare birds were the Dark-eyed (Gray-headed) Junco and a small group of Gray-crowned Rosy-Finches, both in Scotts Bluff Co...|$|R
40|$|In most respects, {{this was}} a routine spring. While a few rarities and several {{interesting}} reports appeared, perhaps most interesting was {{the arrival of the}} electronic age. Foremost was the start-up of 2 ̆ 2 NEBIRDS, 2 ̆ 2 the Nebraska Birding Listserver set up and operated by Robert Price at Kearney. This resource should greatly enhance communication and collective learning amongst birders in the state. We have culled several reports from observations submitted to NEBIRDS, and several reporters now contact us by email. We urge observers to forward their email addresses; if we have questions on their reports, communication would be easy! Submit reports and comments to Ross Silcock by email at silcock@sidney. heartland. net. We also gather sightings reported to the Nebraska Birdline, operated by Loren and Babs Padelford at Bellevue; these reports are placed on the Internet through BIRDCNTR, a service of the National Bird Hotline Cooperative. We should note here that this report contains unverified observations as well as documented observations. And now to the birds! Considerable discussion has taken place about a very 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 warbler migration, 2 ̆ 2 slow 2 ̆ 2 for birders, meaning low numbers of birds, While this is true, most species were indeed found, although very low numbers were found of Magnolia, Black-throated Green, Blackburnian, and Wilson 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and those that were reported occurred rather late in the migration period. Usually when we do not see many migrating warblers it means they have made long, non-stop flights with beneficial tailwinds right over us to their breeding ranges. Much has been made of the scarcity of migrant warblers this spring in the eastern United States, with blame allocated to habitat loss in the tropical wintering ranges, to forest fragmentation in the breeding ranges (in particular with the result of allowing cowbird access to deep-woods birds), and to extensive smoke encountered while crossing the Gulf of Mexico. The smoke, from major fires in Mexico, may have contributed to a slower migration for some species, but we will have to be patient (a human generation or two?) to see what if anything is actually happening. Joel Jorgensen, who did weekly surveys of the eastern Rainwater Basin in April and May, gathered important shorebird data. These data are presented in the relevant shorebird species accounts. Although few early and late dates were set, a few amazing high counts occurred during the report period: for example, 39 Clark 2 ̆ 7 s Grebes, 236 Horned Grebes, and 1, 732 McCown 2 ̆ 7 s Longspurs. Some interesting waterfowl appeared in the Rainwater Basin this spring, suggesting that scrutiny of the immense flocks can yield exciting discoveries: 2 nd state Bean Goose, 2 nd state Garganey, and even a Barnacle Goose, probably not a wild bird. Additional rarities of note included a 1 st documented spring Red-throated Loon, 5 th and 6 th state Neotropic Cormorants, 4 th nesting record White-faced Ibis, 3 Eurasian Wigeon, a 3 rd documented spring Surf Scoter, 4 th state Ruff, 1 st state Short-billed Dowitcher of the eastern subspecies Limnodromus griseus griseus, 10 th and 11 th individual Mew Gulls for the state, 1 st May Glaucous Gull, nesting Eurasian Collared-Doves, a possible nesting population of Monk Parakeets, 6 th southeast Nebraska Say 2 ̆ 7 s Phoebe, documented nesting Pinyon Jays south of Redington, at least 13 Blue-gray Gnatcatchers in the Panhandle, 2 nd state Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> 10 th spring Townsend 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> 2 nd spring Panhandle Prothonotary Warbler, 2 Hooded Warblers, the lingering of an Omaha Black-throated Sparrow until 12 April, a photographed Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sparrow in York Co, and the 2 nd Panhandle breeding record for Great-tailed Grackle...|$|R

Data in one case suggest that group selection type of forest harvest may produce habitats that are beneficial to Cerulean Warblers...|$|R
40|$|Of {{interest}} to many {{is evidence of}} northward movement of species which generally summer on the Great Plains. In addition to White-winged Dove and Scissor-tailed Flycatcher, both slowly establishing as breeders in Nebraska, significant numbers of Glossy Ibis continue to be found, probably associated with major increases in numbers of White-faced Ibis. Perhaps the biggest surprise this late summer and early fall was {{the large number of}} Lesser Goldfinches reported from the southern Panhandle. Less exciting by far, but worthy of attention were reports of several Mute Swans in the Omaha area, including a duo of juveniles, and a couple of sightings of Monk Parakeets, last known to breed in the state in 1998. Neither would be welcome additions to the breeding avifauna of Nebraska. Notable western species found in the east included California Gull and Rufous Hummingbird, while Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Kingbird and Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s Vireo crept eastward farther than usual. Most surprising in this group, however, was a Pygmy Nuthatch in Lincoln, a very rare vagrant in general. A mention also for Varied Thrush, a rare but annual visitor from way west, of which 3 were reported. Conversely, best eastern bird west was an immature Blackburnian Warbler banded in Scotts Bluff County. Relative to last year 2 ̆ 7 s good numbers, both Red-breasted Nuthatch and Purple Finch were back to normal levels. At the time of this writing, no notable incursions of winter birds had been detected. Among regular migrants, Blue-headed Vireo, Nashville Warbler, and Orange-crowned Warbler appeared in excellent numbers; the migration period for Orange-crowned Warbler occupied all of 3 months. Strangely, Wilson 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> usually abundant as a migrant in the west, was at a low ebb. In the category of phenomena, the huge roost of Purple Martins in central Omaha, peaking at 35, 000, was unprecedented as far as we know. Finally, an identification note. Two vireos of the 2 ̆ 2 Solitary 2 ̆ 2 complex were banded, measured, and well photographed in Scotts Bluff County by Nancy Gobris of Nebraska Prairie Partners. Measurements indicated both were unequivocally Cassin 2 ̆ 7 s, but plumage characters indicated at least one may have been a Plumbeous...|$|R
40|$|This {{fall season}} was amazing, or as Stephen Dinsmore put it: 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 The birding was simply {{spectacular}} in western Nebraska this fall, 2 ̆ 2 There was something for everyone, whether rarity-chasers, taxonomists, listers, or whatever. There were {{no fewer than}} four new species for the state list (pending NOURC approval, of course!), a total of 315 species reported, and fascinating information on western subspecies in the Panhandle. Numbers of western migrants reached record levels, exemplified by fall totals of 53 Townsend 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, 25 MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 s Warblers, and 28 Western Tanagers. By contrast, eastern migrant warblers in the east were almost non-existent. At L McConaughy, the exposed flats at {{the west end of}} the reservoir attracted myriads of shorebirds and waterbirds, including record fall counts of Western Grebe (44, 000 !), Green-winged Teal, and a near-record count of Baird 2 ̆ 7 s Sandpipers. Several species also had new fall high counts, notably Cliff Swallow (30, 000 !) and Blue-winged Teal (14, 500 !). Stephen Dinsmore 2 ̆ 7 s diligent coverage of the Panhandle yielded no fewer than four first state records: Reddish Egret, Arctic Tern, Dusky Flycatcher (using mist-nettting, photography, and measurements!), and Black Rosy-Finch. The state total now stands at a healthy 445 species. There was also a host of significant distributional or seasonal reports, notably a first western White-eyed Vireo, first Panhandle documented Eastern Wood-Pewee, a first August-September Pacific Loon, a first August Red-breasted Merganser, a first fall record for Virginia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler,</b> and a second fall Hudsonian Godwit for the state. Not to mention all three jaegers! Sparrows were in mediocre numbers, with not much of interest in that group. Of concern are the few reports of Black-billed Cuckoo in recent years; only two were reported this fall. Despite the total of 315 species reported, no fewer than 17 species of regular, though generally rare, occurrence were not found. Most surprising among these were American Black Duck, American Woodcock, Broad-tailed Hummingbird, Veery, Wood Thrush, Northern Parula, Magnolia Warbler, Yellow-throated Warbler, Prothonotary Warbler, and Summer Tanager. Many of the missed species either depart early in fall or become inconspicuous. Were their breeding seasons unsuccessful...|$|R
40|$|This was {{essentially}} a normal fall season in Nebraska, with no major weather events or significant shifts in breeding or migration ranges, although a possible exception is a first record of Lesser Goldfinch breeding in the state. One observer made the point, though, that the hard freeze in the spring affected seed and fruit crops for fall, most conspicuously resulting in fewer large American Robin flocks. Excellent water conditions in the Rainwater Basin were welcome, but few herons and egrets were present, and no unusual breeding events were reported there. As winter approached, however, increased numbers of a few finch species were noted. Most conspicuous was Purple Finch, which was reported statewide, unusual in the west, where it is normally rare. Other species showing well were Pine Siskin and Red-breasted Nuthatch (OK, it 2 ̆ 7 s not a finch!) Although Mountain Chickadee appeared in good numbers on the Colorado Plains, they were not much in evidence in Nebraska. A few species were found in notable numbers: scoters continued their upward trend of recent years, a flock of 30 - 35 Whooping Cranes must have spectacular, rather incredible flocks of Purple Martins went over Omaha, and 36 Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s Sharptailed Sparrows were counted at one location. Other items of interest were the several species of shorebirds lingering rather late, the slow recovery of Black-capped Chickadees, and proof of a late summer influx and breeding by Marsh Wren, a phenomenon previously attributed mainly to Sedge Wren. Two species appeared in the east unexpectedly: a Broad-tailed Hummingbird in Bellevue was a first for that species in eastern Nebraska while a MacGillivray 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Warbler</b> was photographed in Dodge Co. With a state list of 448, additions are tough to come by, but there were two this fall, an emaciated Royal Tern that generously decided to expire within the state boundaries, {{and at least one}} apparently all-dark frigatebird, unfortunately unidentifiable to species, but still the first documented frigatebird for the state. A pair of 5 th state records was provided by a Gray Flycatcher and a Black-throated Gray Warbler. And we would be remiss if we failed to note that the Curve-billed Thrasher in Sioux Co will celebrate his 5 th anniversary of residence there in October...|$|R
40|$|At stopovers {{sites in}} the Sahara and on Mediterranean islands, European warblers may feed on nectar. As a {{consequence}} of this behaviour the pollen of exploited plants often sticks on the birds' bill or plumage. We analyzed pollen samples carried by migrating warblers staging at Ventotene Island (Italy), a stopover site located in the Central Mediterranean and reached by large numbers of birds after a direct flight from North Africa. We discuss the possible role of migrants as pollen vectors. A total of 38 plant taxa were recorded in the pollen samples collected on 147 migrants. Pollen of Brassica sp., Ferule communis, Citrus sp. and Eucalyptus sp. were most commonly found. The nectar {{of the first two}} plants is largely exploited by warblers on Ventotene and the presence of their pollen on plumage is principally due to nectar feeding in situ. On the contrary, Citrus sp. and Eucalyptus sp., which are scarce and absent on the island respectively, were mainly collected on dried and agglutinated samples and their presence is likely to be due to nectar feeding at other sites than Ventotene. The other 34 plant taxa were recorded with low frequencies. Overall, the data suggest that nectar feeding migrants could play a role as pollen vectors only for Citrus sp., Eucalyptus sp., F communis and Brassica sp. However, the other less common plant taxa could also be useful markers of migration routes. We found species-specific relationships between bird species and the plants used for nectar feeding: short-distance migrants (mainly Eurasian Blackcap Sylvia atricapilla and Subalpine <b>Warbler</b> <b>S.</b> cantillans) land on Ventotene when Brassica sp. flowers are more abundant and they mainly carry the pollen of this species. On the contrary, long-distance migrants (Garden <b>Warbler</b> <b>S.</b> born and Common Whitethroat S. communis) principally transport the pollen of F communis, whose flowering period takes {{place at the same time}} as their staging period on the island. The study underlines the tendency of warblers towards nectar feeding during migration...|$|R
40|$|International audienceStarling's song can {{be divided}} into {{warbling}} and whistles. Whistles have a short and simple structure, whereas warbling is sung in long sequences (most often more than 20 <b>s).</b> In the <b>warbling</b> one can distinguish many different subunits (repetition of motifs). The individual variability of songs was studied in a colony near Frankfurt/Main in West Germany, where starlings were colour banded since 1969. The following results were obtained:Birds from the same colony uttered nearly identical or very similar microstructures in the species-specific whistle themes. Different to the whistle themes very distinct individual differences characterized the warbling. Only a few motif types were common among colony members. The individual repertoire size ranged from 17 to 39 motif types. Comparison of the song of one individual between the breeding season and the following autumn shows that motifs, which were not observed during spring occurred in the autumn. This observation is a hint that starlings are capable to learn new motif types even as adults...|$|R
40|$|In the 1950 <b>s</b> the Seychelles <b>Warbler</b> Acrocephalus sechellensis was {{a highly}} {{threatened}} single-island endemic species {{with a population of}} 26 individuals confined to Cousin Island in the inner Seychelles. Following long-term management of Cousin, the population steadily recovered to around 300 – 360 birds. In order to give the species the security of additional breeding populations, some warblers were successfully transferred to the islands of Aride and Cousine in September 1988 and June 1990 respectively. During the three years after the transfer to Aride and the first year after the transfer to Cousine, mean territory quality (measured as insect prey available) on these islands was significantly higher than that on Cousin, leading to higher reproductive success per territory and survival of juveniles and adult birds. In November 1991, all transferred birds were still alive, and 205 young had fledged successfully, bringing the total warbler population to c. 585 birds. By then there was enough suitable space still remaining on Aride and Cousine for young birds to establish territories and the rise in warbler numbers is expected to continue. The successful establishment of three self-sustaining and viable breeding populations has ensured that the Seychelles Warbler is no longer a globally threatened species. ...|$|R
40|$|Analysis of {{the mean}} date of fi rst captures and median arrival dates of spring {{migration}} for 34 species of birds at Eilat, Israel, revealed that the earlier a species migrates through Eilat, the greater is the inter-annual variation in the total time of its passage. Birds arrive during spring migration in Eilat in four structured and independent waves. Th e annual fl uctuation in the initial arrival dates (initial capture dates) and median dates (median date of all captures), not including recaptures, did {{not depend on the}} length of the mi gratory route. Th is implies that migrants crossing the Sahara desert depart from their winter quarters on diff erent Julian days in diff erent years. We suggest that negative correlations between the median date of the spring migration of early and late migrants depends upon the easterly (Hamsin) wind period. Moreover, we believe that the phenology of all birds during spring migration in Eilat is possibly also determined by external factors such as weather conditions on the African continent or global climatic processes in the Northern hemisphere. Orphean Warblers (Sylvia hortensis) show a strong negative correlation (rs =- 0. 502) of initial capture date with calendar years, whereas other species such as Barred <b>Warbler</b> (<b>S.</b> nisoria; rs =- 0. 391) and Spotted Flycatcher (Muscicapa striata; rs =- 0. 398) display an insignifi cant trend.
