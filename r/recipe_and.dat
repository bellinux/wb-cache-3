5|$|In modern versions, Caerphilly {{cheese is}} used, {{which is a}} {{descendant}} of the old traditional Glamorgan cheese <b>recipe</b> <b>and</b> lends the same general texture and flavour. The basic recipe calls for a mixture of cheese, leeks and breadcrumbs, although some recipes swap the leeks for onions or spring onions and may add herbs such as parsley or further flavourings such as mustard. The mixture is then rolled into sausage shapes, and then fried. There is no sausage casing used, although egg is used to bind the mixture {{so that it does}} not fall apart during the cooking process.|$|E

25|$|In modern times, {{cottonseed}} oil was marketed by Procter & Gamble as a creamed shortening in 1911. Ginning mills {{were happy to}} have someone haul away the cotton seeds. The extracted oil was refined and partially hydrogenated to give a solid at room temperature and thus mimic natural lard, and can it under nitrogen gas. Compared to the rendered lard Procter & Gamble was already selling to consumers, Crisco was cheaper, easier to stir into a <b>recipe,</b> <b>and</b> could be stored {{at room temperature for}} two years without turning rancid.|$|E

25|$|Tejada {{strove to}} {{reconstruct}} and define a Hispanic political tradition and vacillated between {{the role of}} historian and theorist. His understanding of Hispanidad {{was based on the}} concept of Las Españas, seen as embodied in confederal political shape but its essence having been pre-state commonality. Relying on the unity in diversity <b>recipé</b> <b>and</b> incorporating local traditions, including the fueros, Hispanic tradition consisted of two features: Catholic vision of life combined with missionary universalist spirit pursued by a federative monarchy. According to Tejada Hispanidad was born in the Middle Ages, climaxed during the early España de los Austrias and declined due to centralist French tradition imported by the Borbones. His recurring subject was confronting Hispanic and European traditions, the latter born out of anti-Catholic, revolutionary, modernist thought and ultimately responsible for breaking the Hispanic community by force.|$|E

25|$|Taco Bell {{was founded}} by Glen Bell, who first opened a hot dog stand called Bell's Drive-In in San Bernardino, California in 1946 when he was 23 years old. In 1950, he opened Bell's Hamburgers and Hot Dogs in San Bernardino's West Side barrio. According to Gustavo Arellano, author of Taco USA: How Mexican Food Conquered America, Bell watched long lines of {{customers}} at a Mexican restaurant called the Mitla Cafe, located across the street, which attracted a dedicated customer base for its hard-shelled tacos. Bell began eating there regularly, attempting to reverse-engineer the <b>recipe,</b> <b>and</b> eventually won {{the confidence of the}} proprietors such that they allowed him to see how the tacos and other foods were prepared. In late 1951 or early 1952, he took what he had learned and opened a new stand, this time selling tacos under the name of Taco-Tia.|$|E
