To improve the interior, she {{scavenged}} wallpaper, sometimes using different patterns on different walls of the same room. She made a hardwood parquet floor from wooden kerosene crates collected from the freighters and boatmen who patronized the roadhouse. Her ability to grow crops {{and to make a}} pleasant space transformed the inn and its offerings. For meals, she provided fresh milk and eggs, berries, fish, game, and produce picked from the garden and nearby orchard. Afterward, travelers could go to clean, comfortable beds in the multi-story building. A 1929 travelogue of the Richardson Highway described Rika's by the following: [...] "a commodious roadhouse boasting of such luxuries as fresh milk and domestic fowls." ...|$|E
2500|$|The J. Edgar Hoover Building {{is in an}} {{architectural}} style known as Brutalism. The term {{is derived from the}} French term b√©ton brut ("raw concrete"); in Brutalist structures, unprocessed concrete surfaces are commonly used to create [...] "rugged, dramatic surfaces and monumental sculptural forms." [...] The concrete of the Hoover Building shows the marks from the <b>rough</b> <b>wood</b> forms into which the liquid concrete was poured. The exterior is constructed of buff-colored precast and cast-in-place concrete. The intent was to attach sheets of polished concrete or granite to the exterior. The exterior walls were built to accommodate these attachments, but this plan was abandoned as the building neared completion. The windows were of bronze-tinted glass. The cornice line is [...] high on the E Street side. The interior, as built, consisted of white vinyl floor tiles, and polished concrete ceilings and floors painted white. The open-air courtyard was paved with grayish-beige stone, and contained an arcade to shelter employees as they moved around its edge.|$|E
60|$|He unfastened {{the belt}} {{and drew the}} pouch from its hiding place. He was alone. The balance of the camp, save the sentries, had retired--none would enter the Belgian's tent. He fingered the pouch, feeling out the shapes and sizes of the precious, little nodules within. He hefted the bag, first in one palm, then in the other, and at last he wheeled his chair slowly around before the table, and in the rays of his small lamp let the {{glittering}} gems roll out upon the <b>rough</b> <b>wood.</b>|$|E

6000|$|So {{having no}} choice, Aylward came, marching between {{the other two}} and saying nothing. When they had gone {{a couple of hundred}} yards Alan also heard something, and to him it sounded like a man crying out in pain. Then {{suddenly}} they passed round some great trees and reached a glade in the forest where there was a spring of water which Alan remembered. In this glade the camp had been built, surrounded by a [...] "boma" [...] or palisade of <b>rough</b> <b>wood,</b> within which stood two tents and some native shelters made of tall grass and boughs. Outside of this camp a curious and unpleasant scene was in progress.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Portney and {{the boys}} had long since decided where the cabin should be built, up {{against the side of}} a cliff, ten feet in height, which {{overlooked}} the head of the gulch. All the miners in the locality had agreed that this would be the best spot, and six cabins were to be placed there, for hospitality's sake if for no other reason. Mr. Portney had already ordered the dressed lumber needed from the saw-mill; but as this was costly stuff, and expensive to transport, Earl and Randy had declared their intention to go into the timber back of the cliff and get out whatever of <b>rough</b> <b>wood</b> could be made to do.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} I {{went to see}} the hot-springs and mud volcanoes, for which this place is celebrated. A picturesque path among {{plantations}} and ravines brought us to a beautiful circular basin about forty feet in diameter, bordered by a calcareous ledge, so uniform and truly curved, that it looked like a work of art. It was filled with clear water very near the boiling point, and emitted clouds of steam with a strong sulphureous odour. It overflows at one point and forms a little stream of hot water, which at a hundred yards' distance is still too hot to hold the hand in. A little further on, in a piece of <b>rough</b> <b>wood,</b> were two other springs not so regular in outline, but appearing to be much hotter, as they were in a continual state of active ebullition. At intervals of a few minutes, a great escape of steam or gas took place, throwing up a column of water three or four feet high.|$|E
60|$|So {{he came to}} Lake Washington, {{and just}} across it was the city of his long dreams, the city of the Pacific--and of Claire.

60|$|After she {{had been}} married a few months the bride {{wanted to go into}} the city and buy herself some new dresses. She had never been there before, and when she had {{finished}} her shopping, she thought she would pay a visit to her unknown sister-in-law, and rest for a bit. The house she was seeking was in a broad street, and ought to have been very magnificent, but the carved stone portico enclosed a mean little door of <b>rough</b> <b>wood,</b> while a row of beautiful pillars led to nothing. The dwelling on each side were in the same unfinished condition, and water trickled down the walls. Most people would have considered it a wretched place, and turned their backs on it as soon as they could, but this lady saw that by spending some money the houses could be made as splendid as they were originally intended to be, and she instantly resolved to get them for herself.|$|E
60|$|A {{spasm of}} fear went through him. He reached hastily for a brand to throw at her. But {{even as he}} reached, and before his fingers had closed on the missile, she sprang back into safety; {{and he knew that}} she was used to having things thrown at her. She had snarled as she sprang away, baring her white fangs to their roots, all her wistfulness vanishing, being {{replaced}} by a carnivorous malignity that made him shudder. He glanced at the hand that held the brand, noticing the cunning delicacy of the fingers that gripped it, how they adjusted themselves to all the inequalities of the surface, curling over and under and about the <b>rough</b> <b>wood,</b> and one little finger, too close to the burning portion of the brand, sensitively and automatically writhing back from the hurtful heat to a cooler gripping-place; and in the same instant he seemed to see a vision of those same sensitive and delicate fingers being crushed and torn by the white teeth of the she-wolf. Never had he been so fond of this body of his as now when his tenure of it was so precarious.|$|E
6000|$|The banquet {{was spread}} {{in a long}} low hall, built of <b>rough</b> <b>wood</b> lined with shingles, having a fire at each end, the smoke of which, unable to find {{its way through the}} {{imperfect}} chimneys in the roof, rolled in cloudy billows above the heads of the revellers, who sat on low seats, purposely to avoid its stifling fumes. [Footnote: The Welsh houses, like those of the cognate tribes in Ireland and in the Highlands of Scotland, were very imperfectly supplied with chimneys. Hence, in the History of the Gwydir Family, the striking expression of a Welsh chieftain who, the house being assaulted and set on fire by his enemies, exhorted his friends to stand to their defence, saying he had seen as much smoke in the hall upon a Christmas even.] The mien and appearance of the company assembled was wild, and, even in their social hours, almost terrific. Their prince himself had the gigantic port and fiery eye fitted to sway an unruly people, whose delight was in the field of battle; and the long mustaches which he and most of his champions wore, added to the formidable dignity of his presence. Like most of those present, Gwenwyn was clad in a simple tunic of white linen cloth, a remnant of the dress which the Romans had introduced into provincial Britain; and he was distinguished by the Eudorchawg, or chain of twisted gold links, with which the Celtic tribes always decorated their chiefs. The collar, indeed, representing in form the species of links made by children out of rushes, was common to chieftains of inferior rank, many of whom bore it in virtue of their birth, or had won it by military exploits; but a ring of gold, bent around the head, intermingled with Gwenwyn's hair--for he claimed the rank of one of three diademed princes of Wales, and his armlets and anklets, of the same metal, were peculiar to the Prince of Powys, as an independent sovereign. Two squires of his body, who dedicated their whole attention to his service, stood at the Prince's back; and at his feet sat a page, whose duty it was to keep them warm by chafing and by wrapping them in his mantle. The same right of sovereignty, which assigned to Gwenwyn his golden crownlet, gave him a title to the attendance of the foot-bearer, or youth, who lay on the rushes, and whose duty it was to cherish the Prince's feet in his lap or bosom. [Footnote: See Madoc for this literal foot page's office and duties. Mr. Southey's notes inform us: [...] "The foot-bearer shall hold the feet of the King in his lap, from the time he reclines at the board till he goes to rest, and he shall chafe them with a towel; and during all that time shall watch that no harm befalls the King. He shall eat of the shame dish from which the King takes his food; he shall light the first candle before the King." [...] Such are the instructions given for this part of royal ceremonial in the laws of Howell Dha. It may be added, that probably upon this Celtic custom was founded one of those absurd and incredible representations which were propagated {{at the time of the}} French revolution, to stir up the peasants against their feudal superiors. It was pretended that some feudal seigneurs asserted their right to kill and disembowel a peasant, in order to put their own feet within the expiring body, and so recover them from the chill.] ...|$|E

40|$|Understanding wetting {{behavior}} and surface coverage of resins on a wood surface {{is important to}} obtain satisfactory adhesion and optimize adhesive application for wood composite manufacturing. Sessile and micro-droplets of urea- and phenol-formaldehyde (UF and PF) resins were generated on wood surfaces to observe wetting behaviors using three directional image generation system and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The generated micro-droplet sizes varied in diameter from 1 ‚Äì 100 ÔøΩm and showed differing wetting behavior based on droplet size and surface conditions. <b>Rougher</b> <b>wood</b> surfaces prevented microdroplet spreading and resulted in higher contact angles. Contact angles along the fiber direction of the earlywood significantly differed from the angles collected across the fiber direction. Sessile droplet models and dimensionless droplet shape factors (DSF) were used to develop the parameters governing the droplet shape changes from a spherical droplet to an enclosing hemispherical droplet for early- and latewood surfaces. Droplet dispersing areas with earlywood showed 111 % with UF and 42 % for PF faster changes along the fiber surface as compared to across the fiber surface...|$|R

60|$|For it chanced one {{day that}} his walk led him into {{a portion of the}} uplands which was almost unknown to him. Scrambling through some <b>rough</b> <b>woods,</b> he came out upon a moorland {{reaching}} towards the hills. A few lofty Scotch firs grew hard by upon a knoll; a clear fountain near the foot of the knoll sent up a miniature streamlet which meandered in the heather. A shower had just skimmed by, but now the sun shone brightly, and the air smelt of the pines and the grass. On a stone under the trees sat a young lady sketching. We have learned to think of women in a sort of symbolic transfiguration, based on clothes; and one of the readiest ways in which we conceive our mistress is as a composite thing, principally petticoats. But humanity has triumphed over clothes; the look, the touch of a dress has become alive; and the woman who stitched herself into these material integuments has now permeated right through and gone out to the tip of her skirt. It was only a black dress that caught Dick Naseby's eye; but it took possession of his mind, and all other thoughts departed. He drew near, and the girl turned round. Her face startled him; it was a face he wanted; and he took it in at once like breathing air.|$|R
