40|$|Young {{stock rearing}} is an {{important}} factor on dairy farms. However, the costs of young stock rearing are often unknown while most costs are contributed to the dairy cows. In addition to that, most farmers have great difficulties in estimating the costs of young stock rearing. Previous research shows that the costs of young stock rearing can be up to € 1540 per successfully bred heifer or 13 % of the cost price of milk (Mohd Nor et al., 2012). In order to calculate the young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> on Dutch dairy farms, 43 farms were visited and a calculation of their young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> was made using JonKos, a module designed by WUR Livestock Research, DLV and WUR Business economics (WUR Livestock Research et al., 2011). The average costs of young stock rearing on dairy farms according to this research project were € 1559 per successfully reared heifer. Young stock rearing farms had lower average <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> than dairy farms (€ 1273 versus € 1606 resp.), although this proved not to be significant (p= 0. 056; B=- 0. 294). The total hours spent on young stock rearing had a significant effect on the total young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> per heifer on dairy farms (p= 0, 049; B= 0. 326). In addition, a rise in the average age at first calving did lead to a significant rise the costs of young stock rearing per 100 kg milk (p= 0, 01; B= 0, 426). The farmers that participated in this research project estimated their <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> to be € 994 per successfully reared heifer, thereby underestimating the young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> by € 312 per heifer. There was no significant relation between the calculated young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> on a farm and the estimation by the farmer, which leads {{to the conclusion that the}} farmers that participated in this project were not able to make an educated guess of their young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs.</b> All farmers that participated in this research project wanted more information on young stock rearing and the costs accompanied with the rearing period. In addition, all farmers would recommend calculating the costs of the young stock period to other farmers...|$|E
40|$|The {{costs of}} rearing young dairy cattle {{are a part}} of the cost of the price of milk, as rearing {{produces}} the future dairy cows. As most dairy farmers are not aware of the <b>rearing</b> <b>costs,</b> the rearing of dairy replacements often does not get the attention it deserves. Calculating the distribution of the <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> throughout the rearing process is difficult as the costs are correlated with biological processes, such as variation in growth rate and disease uncertainty. In this study, a calf level simulation model was built to estimate the <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> and their distribution from 2 weeks of age until first calving in the Netherlands. The uncertainties related to calf diseases (calf scours and bovine respiratory disease) were included, in which both the probabilities of disease and the effects of diseases (growth reduction) differ at different ages. In addition, growth was modeled stochastically and in a detailed manner using a two-phase growth function. The total cost of rearing young dairy cattle was estimated as € 1567 per successfully reared heifer and varied between € 1423 and € 1715. Reducing the age of first calving by 1 month reduced the total cost between 2. 6 % and 5. 7 %. The difference in the average cost of rearing between heifers that calved at 24 months and those calving at 30 months was € 400 per heifer reared. Average <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> were especially influenced by labor efficiency and cost of feed. The <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> of a heifer that experienced disease at least once (20 % of the simulated heifers) were on average € 95 higher than those of healthy heifers. Hence, for an individual diseased heifer, disease costs can be rather high, while the relative contribution to the average rearing cost for a standard Dutch dairy farm is low (approx. 3 %). Overall, the model developed proved to be a useful tool to investigate the total cost of rearing young dairy cattle, providing insights to dairy farmers with respect to the cost-efficiency of their own rearing managemen...|$|E
40|$|An {{important}} part of a dairy farm is the rearing of young stock. This {{has to be done}} accurately, not only because the new dairy cows will replace the old ones, but also as a lot of money is involved. This has become clear in previous research, which has shown that the successful rearing of one heifer costs € 1. 540. This is 13 % of the cost price of milk. 9 To gain more understanding in young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs,</b> 40 farms from the Veterinary Centre Zuid-Oost Drenthe were visited. During this visit, calculations of young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> were made with the spreadsheet Jonkos from, among others, WUR Livestock Research. In this study, the average of the young stock <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> on the visited farms was € 1. 967 per heifer, with costs ranging from € 919 to € 3. 307. It was also shown that increased scaling is beneficial for costs. An increase in scaling factors researched led to a lower total young stock rearing cost per heifer. An increase in milk production (β=- 0, 337; P= 0, 028), the number of dairy cows (β=- 0, 360; P= 0, 037) or the number of young stock (β=- 0, 435; P= 0. 009) were all significant factors leading to reduction of costs. The age at first calving (AFC) was vice versa: a increase in AFC lead to a significant rise in the <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> per heifer (β= 0, 551; P= 0, 001). Comparing the net returns from the heifers with the AFC (P= 0, 109) also showed a remarkable result, namely that there was no significant link between the two. This is surprising, as a lot of farmers claim to experience otherwise. The net returns of the heifers compared with the score of the veterinarian was shown to be almost significant (P= 0, 054), suggesting that a higher level of management skills may lead to an increase in the net returns...|$|E

The main mechanism rests on the adjustment of the average <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> of a surviving child. Finally, we extend the model considering the effects of labor taxation.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of plumage color polymorphism in the parasitic jaeger (Stercorarius parasiticus) {{is still not}} well understood. Earlier studies indicated that selection may favor pale females and melanic males. If so, females would maximize their fitness, producing pale female and melanic male offspring. We therefore predicted that females might bias their offspring sex ratio toward daughters in pale pairs and toward sons in melanic pairs. Females might also choose to mate assortatively in relation to plumage color, thereby maximizing the probability of producing either pale or melanic offspring. Because females are larger than males, differential <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> may affect the offspring sex ratio independent of parental plumage color. We examined offspring sex ratio allocation, breeding variables indicative of parental quality, and mating pattern in relation to plumage color in a colony of parasitic jaegers in northern Norway. Jaegers tended to mate assortatively in relation to plumage color. The reproductive performance declined with season, and matched pairs appeared to be of lower quality than mixed pairs. The proportion of male offspring increased with hatching date in matched pale and mixed pairs, whereas the situation was reversed in matched melanic pairs. Matched pale pairs produced an overall surplus of favorable pale but costly daughters despite their lower quality, while melanic pairs produced a surplus of favorable melanic sons. However, differential offspring <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> and parental rearing capacity may have additionally affected the realized offspring sex ratio. Mixed pairs producing an overall surplus of pale and melanic daughters allocated their resources according to differential <b>rearing</b> <b>costs</b> and parental quality only. We suggest that both strategies of sex ratio allocation together with differences in reproductive success in matched versus mixed pairs may have a balancing effect on the mating pattern between plumage morphs and {{may contribute to the}} {{maintenance of}} the color polymorphism in this species.

The effects of predator stadia and release rates on field establishment and within-crop-canopy dispersal after hand release were recorded in soybean, cotton and sunflower.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we show that, when {{endogenous}} fertility is considered via Cobb-Douglas preferences, public debt plays a clear-cut role on dynamic inefficiency (DI) of an OLG economy: in fact, for correcting the DI problem, debt must be increased (decreased) {{when the economy}} is overaccumulating (underaccumulating). The occurrence of overaccumulation, and, thus, the necessity of a positive level of debt, is favoured by a small capital income share, on the technological side, and a sufficiently high degree of patience and a low preference for children on preferences grounds. As for the optimal level of debt, our analysis shows that a high level ofdebt {{is more likely to be}} optimal for countries with a relatively low share of capital, with high <b>costs</b> for <b>rearing</b> children, with high individuals' degree of patience; as for individuals preference for children, as expected, the preference for a numerous family reduces the risk of overaccumulation and, thus, the optimal level of national debt. Moreover, interestingly, although in our model the occurrence of dynamic inefficiency (DI) does not depend on the level of the child <b>rearing</b> <b>cost,</b> such cost magnifies the degree of inefficiency and, therefore, a higher public debt is required for correcting DI.

40|$|In {{the present}} work we show that, when one allows for {{endogenous}} fertility in Diamonds (1965) OLG model, public debt plays still a clear-cut role on dynamic inefficiency (DI) : for correcting DI, national debt must be increased. DI {{is more likely}} to occur when the economy capital income share and the preference for children are sufficiently low and the degree of patience is sufficiently high. However, differently from Diamond's case, DI {{turns out to be a}} necessary but not a su¢cient condition for welfare improvements to obtain via debt increases, since, in presence of endogenous fertility, the optimal level of debt is typically lower than the one associated to the traditional Golden Rule. Hence, not taking fertility choices into account would lead policymakers to overshoot the target, i. e. to issue too high a level of national debt. Finally, a sensitivity analysis shows that the optimal level of debt is higher the lower the capital share, the higher individuals' degree of patience, the bigger the child <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> and the lower the preference for children.

Individual females produced an unbiased sex ratio on high-quality diets, but over-produced sons in poor dietary conditions, even though they maintained similar condition between diet treatments. Despite the lack of sexual size dimorphism, such sex ratio adjustment is in line with predictions from sex allocation theory because nutritionally stressed foster sons were healthier, grew faster and were more likely to survive than daughters. These findings suggest that mothers may adaptively adjust offspring sex ratios to optimally match their offspring to the expected quality of the rearing environment. 7 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{assigned}} to determine the present status including general information, feeding breeding housing milking etc. and costs & returns of small dairy farms, to compare the productive and reproductive performance of crossbred and indigenous cows and to make recommendation for development of small scales dairy farm. With this view, the empirical data were collected by using protested questionnaire. The study was conducted at 8 thanas in Rangpur district, and four months-long survey was diminished on thirty small dairy owners. It appeared from the study that 57 % farm owners belong to business class and remaining 43 per cent to different categories. Fifty three per cent took dairying as a side-business whereas only 47 per cent {{took it as a}} main business enterprise. Major percentage of farm owner education level that was Higher Secondary level (60 %) and the average number of animal per farm was 13. 01. The average monthly income of farm owners found in the study area was Tk. 4387. It was observed that farm owners had 85. 4 % crossbred (like Friesian cross and Jersey cross) and was 14. 6 % indigenous cattle, and 87 % farmers used artificial insemination and rest used both artificial and natural services. Daily milk yield/cow/farm was 4. 27 and 1. 78 liters for a crossbred and indigenous dairy cow, respectively. It was estimated that the <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> of dairy cow was Tk. 67. 5 /cow/day and return from rearing dairy cow was Tk. 85. 2 /cow/day. The net return was Tk. 17. 7 /cow/day from crossbred in the study area and cost benefit rati...|$|R
40|$|Rarely human {{communities}} coexist {{in harmony}} with large predators. Most often communities suffer due to predation on their stock while large carnivores suffer losses and at times extirpation due to retaliation. We examine the mechanisms permitting the coexistence of Asiatic lions (Panthera leo persica) and pastoral communities (Maldharis) in the Gir forests, India. We monitored six Maldhari settlements between 2005 and 2007 to quantify seasonal livestock holding, density and losses due to predation and other causes. Lion density, estimated by mark recapture, was 15 ± 0. 1 SE/ 100 km(2). Livestock density, estimated by total counts, ranged between 25 /km(2) - 31 /km(2) with buffaloes being most abundant. Average livestock holding of Maldhari families was 33 ± 3 SE. Lions predated mostly on unproductive cattle (30 %). Scat analysis (n = 165), predation events (n = 180) and seven continuous monitoring sessions of 1, 798 hours on four radio-collared lions estimated livestock to contribute between 25 to 42 % of lions' biomass consumptions, of which only 16 % was predated; rest scavenged. With free grazing rights within Gir forests, Maldharis offset 58 ± 0. 2 SE% of annual livestock <b>rearing</b> <b>cost</b> in comparison to non-forest dwelling pastoralists. With government compensation scheme for livestock predation, this profit margin augmented to 76 ± 0. 05 SE%. Lion density was higher in areas with Maldhari livestock in comparison to areas without livestock. Thus, the current lifestyles and livestock holdings of Maldharis seem to be beneficial to both lions and local pastoralists. We conclude {{that a combination of}} strict protection regime for lions, Maldharis' traditional reverence towards lions and the livelihood economics permit the delicate balance of lion-Maldhari coexistence. Indefinite increase in human and livestock population within Gir might upset this equilibrium undermining the conservation objectives. We see no end to compensation programs worldwide as they constitute a crucial element needed for human-carnivore coexistence...|$|R
