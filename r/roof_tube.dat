40|$|Examination of {{a failed}} <b>roof</b> <b>tube</b> from a bagasse boiler showed {{transverse}} through-cracks and extensive pitting. The pitting was typically an oxygen induced pitting and numerous fatigue cracks had started within these pits. It is highly probable that the pitting occurred during an idle period (a drought) due to oxygen ingress and failure to maintain a sucient excess of the oxygen scavenger, sodium sulfite. The transverse orientation of the cracks and other factors suggest that the fatigue cracking is related to tube vibrations. 7 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

50|$|A longstanding {{argument}} {{exists between}} proponents {{of these two}} technologies. Some {{of this can be}} related to the physical structure of evacuated tube collectors which have a discontinuous absorbance area. An array of evacuated <b>tubes</b> on a <b>roof</b> has open space between the collector tubes, and vacuum between the two concentric glass tubes of each collector. Collector tubes cover only a fraction of a unit area of a <b>roof.</b> If evacuated <b>tubes</b> are compared with flat-plate collectors on the basis of area of roof occupied, a different conclusion might be reached than if the areas of absorber were compared. In addition, the ISO 9806 standard is ambiguous in describing {{the way in which the}} efficiency of solar thermal collectors should be measured, since these could be measured either in terms of gross area or in terms of absorber area. Unfortunately, power output is not given for thermal collectors as it is for PV panels. This makes it difficult for purchasers and engineers to make informed decisions.|$|R
40|$|A hummocky flow characterised by the {{presence}} of toes, lobes, tumuli and possible lava tube system is exposed near Daund, western Deccan Volcanic Province, India. The lava tube system is exposed as several exhumed outcrops and is composed of complex branching and discontinuous segments.

At some places the tube walls exhibit a single layer of lava lining, whereas, at other places it shows an additional layer characterised by smooth surface and polygonal cracks. The presence of a branching and meandering lava tube system in the Daund flow, which represents the terminal parts of Thakurwadi Formation, shows that the hummocky flow developed at a low local volumetric flow rate.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to {{characterize}} the eruptive behavior of Olympus Mons, Mars, by estimating flow speeds and volume fluxes for lava flows produced from various vents on the volcano. During my fellowship, I have made width, depth and ground slope measurements of 65 lava tubes and 271 channels from 56 MOC images and 65 THEMIS images of Olympus Mons. The data show that channels are more numerous than tubes, but this may be due to the fact that tubes cannot be detected until they collapse and are therefore likely under represented due to sampling biases. We observe that tubes are prevalent near the summit while channels are dominantly seen on the middle and lower flanks as well as on the basal scarp. Channels are found on a variety of slopes from 0 to 29 °, while tubes are found on slopes less than 10 °. This is consistent with the terrestrial experience that <b>tube</b> <b>roofs</b> form less readily on steep slopes...|$|R

We employ a culture system that permits confocal analysis of stage 10 – 14 egg chambers. Time-lapse imaging of GFP-Moesin-expressing egg chambers reveals three phases of morphogenesis: tube formation, anterior extension, and paddle maturation. The dorsal-appendage-forming cells, previously thought to represent a single cell fate, consist of two subpopulations, those forming the <b>tube</b> <b>roof</b> and those forming the tube floor. These two cell types exhibit distinct morphological and molecular features. Roof-forming cells constrict apically and express high levels of Broad protein. Floor cells lack Broad, express the rhomboid-lacZ marker, and form the floor by directed cell elongation. We examine the morphogenetic phenotype of the bullwinkle (bwk) mutant and identify defects in both roof and floor formation. Dorsal appendage formation is an excellent system in which cell biological, molecular, and genetic tools facilitate the study of epithelial morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Lava tubes {{form when}} narrow lava {{channels}} crust over, build levees which arch over the channel and converge, or prograde {{through a series}} of toes at the front of a flow. Tube morphology is controlled by eruption rates, flow regime, thermal erosion, pre-existing tubes, and topography. Lava tubes are known from Martian regions of basaltic volcanism by surface ridges and collapsed tubes visible in Viking orbiter photographs, with the best evidence coming from Alba Patera and the Tharsis and Elysium volcanic provinces. Methods for searching for intact lava tubes include Earth-based very long baseline radar, orbital radar and photographic searches, kinetic penetrators, seismic surveys, and mobile surface exploration platforms. Advantages of lava tubes as base sites are sheltered environments, constant temperatures, and freedom to use cheaper, lighter-weight construction materials and less shielding and insulation for humans and equipment in the base. Drawbacks include difficult access and possible distance from necessary resources. Issues to be addressed include volatile distribution and contamination of the tube atmosphere, structural properties of <b>tube</b> <b>roofs,</b> and geographic relationships with potential resources...|$|R
40|$|The 18. 0 ± 1. 0 ka Twin Craters {{lava flow}} in New Mexico {{provides}} an opportunity to study morphological changes of a lava flow that encountered a topographic obstacle. Facies mapping and airborne image analysis were performed on an area surrounding a 1000 m long limestone bluff oriented perpendicular to the flow direction. A pahoehoe flow and 3 ̆e 2. 5 km long lava tube are found upstream. Within 1200 m of the bluff, emplacement characteristics changed abruptly to include localized areas of disrupted pahoehoe.

40|$|A portable, {{electromagnetic}} loop-coupling device {{has been}} built to locate points on the earth's surface over points in an underground cavity and to determine the depth to the cavity. This method presently requires both an underground and a surface operator who each carry a motorcycle battery, a twenty-inch diameter loop antenna, and a compact transceiver circuit. The underground unit transmits to the surface a l 200 hz signal which is essentially unattenuated and undistorted. The surface operator locates the transmitter by a nulling procedure. Three methods of determining depth are described. The accuracy of the location and the depth determination with the loop-coupling device is checked with a transit survey. The device was applied with success to Kaumana Lava Tube {{on the island of}} Hawaii. Locations confirmed suspicions that the tube ran under roads and buildings.

40|$|Two {{analytical}} {{models are}} proposed to describe two different mechanisms of lava tubes formation. A first model is introduced {{to describe the}} development of a solid crust in the central region of the channel, and the formation of a tube when crust widens until it reaches the leveés. The Newtonian assumption is considered and the steady state Navier- Stokes equation in a rectangular conduit is solved. A constant heat flux density assigned at the upper flow surface resumes the combined effects of two thermal processes: radiation and convection into the atmosphere. Advective terms are also included, by the introduction of velocity into the expression of temperature. Velocity is calculated as an average value over the channel width, so that lateral variations of temperature are neglected. As long as the upper flow surface cools, a solid layer develops, described as a plastic body, having a resistance to shear deformation. If the applied shear stress exceeds this resistance, crust breaks, otherwise, solid fragments present at the flow surface can weld together forming a continuous roof, as it happens in the sidewall flow regions. Variations of channel width, ground slope and effusion rate are analyzed, as parameters that strongly affect the shear stress values. Crust growing is favored when the channel widens, and tube formation is possible when the ground slope or the effusion rate reduce. A comparison of results is successfully made with data obtained from the analysis of pictures of actual flows. The second model describes the formation of a stable, well defined crust along both channel sides, their growing towards the center and their welding to form the <b>tube</b> <b>roof.</b> The fluid motion is described as in the model above. Thermal budget takes into account conduction into the atmosphere, and advection is included considering the velocity depending both on depth and channel width. The solidified crust has a non uniform thickness along the channel width. Stresses acting on the crust are calculated using the equations of the elastic thin plate, pinned at its ends. The model allows to calculate the distance where crust thickness is able to resist the drag of the underlying fluid and to sustain its weight by itself, and the level of the fluid can lower below the <b>tube</b> <b>roof.</b> Viscosity and thermal conductivity have been experimentally investigated {{through the use of a}} rotational viscosimeter. Analyzing samples coming from Mount Etna (2002) the following results have been obtained: the fluid is Newtonian and the thermal conductivity is constant in a range of temperature above the liquidus. For lower temperature, the fluid becomes non homogeneous, and the used experimental techniques are not able to detect any properties, because measurements are not reproducible. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of lava tubes {{is a common}} phenomenon on some basaltic volcanoes, such as Etna. A model for <b>tube</b> formation by <b>roofing</b> of a channel is proposed and involves first describing lava as a Bingham liquid flowing down a slope. It is further assumed that lava flows in a channel with rectangular cross section: {{as a result of}} heat loss into the atmosphere, a crust is gradually formed on the upper surface of the flow and this crust eventually welds to the channel levees. We assume that a lava tube is formed when such a crust is sufficiently thick to resist the drag of the underlying flow and to sustain itself under its own weight. The minimum thickness of the crust satisfying such conditions depends on the tensile strength and shear strength of the crust itself. Assuming that the growth of the crust produces a downflow linear increase of the shear stress at the interface between flowing lava and the crust, the distance is evaluated between the eruption vent and the point where the tube is formed. The model predicts that if the flow rate is constant, the thickness of the flow increases as the crust fragments grow and weld to each other, and the velocity of the crust decreases to zero. Once the lava tube is formed, the initial flow rate can be achieved by a Row thickness smaller than the vertical size of the tube, with the same viscous dissipation: this may explain why under steady state conditions, the lava level inside a tube is frequently lower than the <b>roof</b> of the <b>tube</b> itself...|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{of narrow}} tube-fed basaltic lava flows (tens of meters across), {{such as those}} {{confined}} by topography, can be focused predominantly along {{the roof of a}} lava tube. This can lead to the development of an unusually long tumulus, its shape matching the sinuosity of the underlying lava tube. Such a situation occurred during Klauea Volcanos (Hawaii, USA) ongoing East Rift Zone eruption on a lava tube active from July through November 2010. Short-lived breakouts from the tube buried the flanks of the sinuous, ridge-like tumulus, while the tumulus crest, its surface composed of lava formed very early in the flows emplacement history, remained poised above the surrounding younger flows. At least several of these breakouts resulted in irrecoverable uplift of the <b>tube</b> <b>roof.</b> Confined sections of the prehistoric Carrizozo and McCartys flows (New Mexico, USA) display similar sinuous, ridge-like features with comparable surface age relationships. We contend that these distinct features formed in a fashion equivalent to that of the sinuous tumulus that formed at Klauea in 2010. Moreover, these sinuous tumuli may be analogs for some sinuous ridges evident in orbital images of the Tharsis volcanic province on Mars. The short-lived breakouts from the sinuous tumulus at Klauea were caused by surges in discharge through the lava tube, in response to cycles of deflation and inflation (DI events) at Klauea's summit. The correlation between DI events and subsequent breakouts aided in lava flow forecasting. Breakouts from the sinuous tumulus advanced repeatedly toward the sparsely populated Kalapana Gardens subdivision, destroying two homes and threatening others. Hazard assessments, including flow occurrence and advance forecasts, were relayed regularly to the Hawaii County Civil Defense to aid their lava flow hazard mitigation efforts while this lava tube was active...|$|R
40|$|Several {{wave energy}} {{conversion}} techniques have been patented {{all over the}} world. Despite this large variation in design, the Wave Energy Converters (WECs) are generally categorized by location, type and modes of operation. An Oscillating Water Column consists of a chamber with an opening to the sea below the water line. An OWC consists of a box with a big vertical opening in the front wall. Waves enter through this opening with only some small diffraction effects from the front wall (and they propagate on the water surface in the box. On {{the roof of the}} box there is a tube connecting the atmosphere with the air pocket enclosed between the water surface and the <b>roof.</b> This <b>tube</b> contains one or more self-rectifying turbine (like the Wells). The air pocket inside the box, is compressed and expanded alternately. As a consequence, an air flow is produced which drives the turbine in the tube. In the conventional OWC waves enter the plant undergoing some diffraction effects produced by {{the lower end of the}} front wall. U-OWC plants are breakwaters in reinforced concrete embodying an OWC with an additional vertical duct on the front wall. In this work, we carried out a numerical experiment aiming to analyze the interaction between waves and a U-OWC breakwater. The numerical method adopted is the numerical integration of Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equation (RANS). The water-air interaction is taken into account by means of the Volume Of Fluid (VOF) model implemented in the commercial CFD code Ansys Fluent. To validate the numerical flume, we carried out some preliminary tests finalized to compare numerical results of a vertical reflecting wall with the analytical solution of linear standing waves. The results have shown that there is a suitable correspondence between analytical and numerical simulation and this confirms that the wave field expanding along the wave flume has the characteristics of a progressive wave. The progressive wave train propagating in the wave flume impacts on a vertical wall and is reflected backwards. The reflected wave train superimposed with the incident waves generates a standing wave field propagating from the breakwater towards the wavemaker. The numerical experiment has been carried out by substituting the vertical wall with the U-OWC. The geometry and size of the U-OWC breakwater utilized in this work is the same as the 1 : 6 scale physical model of breakwater tested directly, at sea, off the coast of Reggio Calabria (in the eastern coast of the Messina Straits). The performance of the plant depends on whether it is working in resonance or not. To check the plant working conditions, we choose waves with characteristics (height and period) similar to those which interacted with the plant at sea. Therefore, we made several simulations, varying the wave period in the range [2. 5, s 9 s] and maintaining the wave height fixed at 0. 2 m...|$|R
