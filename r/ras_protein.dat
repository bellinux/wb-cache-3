40|$|The ras genes, {{which were}} first {{identified}} by {{their presence in}} RNA tumor viruses and which belong to a highly conserved gene family in vertebrates, have 2 close homologues in yeast, detectable by Southern blotting. Both genes (RAS 1 and RAS 2) were cloned from plasmid libraries and determined the complete nucleotide sequence of their coding regions. They encode proteins with nearly 90 % homology to the first 80 positions of the mammalian <b>ras</b> <b>proteins,</b> and nearly 50 % homology to the next 80 amino acids. Yeast RAS 1 and RAS 2 proteins are more homologous to each other, with about 90 % homology for the first 180 positions.

Using this assay, we discovered that RasC and RasG showed a rapid and transient activation when aggregation-competent cells were stimulated with the chemoattractant cAMP, and this activation did not occur in a number of cAMP signalling mutants.

40|$|Background: Dictyostelium {{possesses}} a surprisingly {{large number of}} <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins</b> and {{little is known about}} their activators, the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). It is also unclear, in Dictyostelium or in higher eukaryotes, whether Ras pathways are linear, with each Ras controlled by its own GEF, or networked, with multiple GEFs acting on multiple <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins.</b> Results: We have identified the Dictyostelium gene that encodes RasGEFB, a protein with homology to known RasGEFs such as the Son-of-sevenless (Sos) protein. Dictyostelium cells in which the gene for RasGEFB was disrupted moved unusually rapidly, but lost the ability to perform macropinocytosis and therefore to grow in liquid medium. Crowns, the sites of macropinocytosis, were replaced by polarised lamellipodia. Mutant cells were also profoundly defective in early development, although they eventually formed tiny but normally proportioned fruiting bodies. This defect correlated with loss of discoidin Iγ mRNA, a starvation-induced gene, although other genes required for development were expressed normally or even precociously. RasGEFB was able to rescue a Saccharomyces CDC 25 mutant, indicating that it is a genuine GEF for <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins.</b> Conclusions: RasGEFB appears to be the principal activator of the RasS protein, which regulates macropinocytosis and cell speed, but it also appears to regulate one or more other <b>Ras</b> <b>proteins...</b>|$|R
