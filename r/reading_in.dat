The current study investigated whether semantic and perceptual processes are differentially activated when words are <b>read</b> <b>in</b> context and isolation. Twenty-two younger children (7 - 9 years old), 21 older children (11 - 13 years old), and 24 undergraduates (18 - 35 years old) were exposed to a total of 20 target words: 10 words were <b>read</b> <b>in</b> a story (context) and 10 different words were <b>read</b> <b>in</b> a list (isolation).

The results are discussed in terms of their relation to semantic and perceptual processes...|$|R
