40|$|Renewable energy, {{especially}} biofuels, {{is seen as}} {{a viable}} solution to replace the depleting fossil fuels. Moreover, tighter environmental regulations across the world force many countries to develop strategic approaches to target and screen relevant <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and technologies. Because there are significant variations in types of biomass and conversion methods, determining the economical effectiveness of overall supply chain (SC) is a complex task. Thus, a holistic approach which accounts for economic, environmental and production aspects across the SC, starting from cultivation to the final products, and establishing appropriate links among them at each stage is imperative in analyzing overall chain efficiency. In this work, for analysis of SC, mathematical modelling is paired with linear programming (LP), which accounts for the variability of technologies that uses biomass as input. The analysis includes economic and environmental factors along the SC. Green House Gases (GHG) is analysed in terms of carbon-equivalent units and converted into monetary values to form financial objective. In addition, incentives for each party in the SC to have economical gain have also been considered. To validate the developed methodology, a case study from Northern Italy is investigated that takes corn stover as a feedstock and targeting production of ethanol with ash, carbon dioxide and DDGS being by-products. It should be highlighted that different types of ethanol conversion technologies are analyzed in terms of overall SC and compliance of GHG emission with existing regulation is also taken into account in the case study. © 2012 Elsevier B.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 In 2010, governments {{spent over}} $ 4. 05 {{trillion}} on health. This is 7 % {{of the world}} economy. This dissertation measures the health outcomes achieved by this spending, how this spending changes upon the receipt of health aid, and the methods used to analyze this spending. The first chapter assesses the effect of government health expenditure on health outcomes. I use a large cross-country panel and a new instrument to test how domestic government health expenditure affects under-five mortality. I find that the average spending-to-outcome elasticity is - 0. 34, although it ranges between - 0. 04 and - 0. 61 depending on country-level characteristics. Countries with larger GDP per capita and more civil liberties, political rights, and democracy have the elasticities furthest from zero, although countries with the largest under-five mortality rates have the largest effects when measured in deaths averted. The second chapter assesses the crowding out of domestic government health expenditure upon the receipt of development assistance for health channeled to the government. Using a cross-country dynamic panel, I use Difference GMM to simultaneously measure the displacement and replacement rates. I find that increases in development assistance lead to the displacement of government resources, but the reduction in development assistance {{does not lead to}} the <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> Combined with the estimates from the first chapter, these findings suggest that net effect of health aid is less than previously measured. The third chapter is an assessment three linear regression estimation methods used to control for unobserved heterogeneity that exists in most clustered data. This type of heterogeneity exists in most analyses of government health expenditure. This chapter explains the standard clustered data model, the traditional random- and fixed-effects estimators, and the `within-between' estimator - a variant of a model proposed by Mundlak in 1978. Simulation is used to illustrate when each estimator is optimal. The chapter ends with recommendations for when each estimator is preferred...|$|E

When looking at the relationship between environment and economic growth, we should have in mind two roles that nature plays in the economic processes.

Natural resources are considered as an important factor for economic growth. However, the empirical analyses on the relationship between the abundance in natural resources and economic growth are inconclusive. While there are scholars who argue that the countries with ample <b>of</b> natural <b>resources</b> experience the resource curse, there are also contra-arguments, that abundance <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> do not put a curse on countries’ economic development.

When used in combination with environmentally sound production and processing techniques, the use of biomass {{can be seen as}} a sustainable alternative to conventional feedstocks. The production of chemicals utilises more effectively the intrinsic biomass (chemical) structure than the production of fuels or electricity from biomass does. The production of chemicals from biomass also saves more fossil energy than producing just energy. For example, some amino acids obtained from grass are very suitable starting materials for highly functionalized chemicals that are traditionally prepared from petrochemistry. Economical production routes of chemicals from biomass require large scale substitution of (bulk) chemicals which connects to current approaches and facilities (process integration) of the petrochemical industries to convert crude oil into chemical building blocks. Genetic modification of plants will increase the potential of biomass in the chemical industry because it allows an increase in the concentrations of the required (bio-) chemical pre-cursors e. g. amino acids, present. It will also be discussed how small scale (pre) processing of the biomass can be advantageous over large scale processing. This is because of lower transportation costs but also the opportunity to use process-integrations that can not be used on large scale. These integrations yield high efficiencies of energy utilization but require improvement on social or organisational level...|$|R
