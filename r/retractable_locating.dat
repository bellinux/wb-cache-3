50|$|In July 2013, {{during summer}} {{holidays}} the <b>retractable</b> roof <b>located</b> over the school's atrium was partially dislodged during a thunderstorm. After months of renovation, {{it has been}} transformed into the new Learning Commons, which is now open.|$|R
50|$|The handle is <b>retractable</b> and is <b>located</b> at {{the base}} of the instrument. This is where the patient holds the apparatus.|$|R
50|$|The second {{version of}} the armor, reconfigured by Stark, {{contained}} upgraded improvements such as heat seeking missile launchers, pulse cannon, and <b>retractable</b> weapon pods <b>located</b> on its back. Rhodes utilized different types of specialty ammunition as well as non-lethal weapons such as rubber bullets. Though Rhodes lost the original armor, he still possessed a functional prototype helmet and gauntlet.|$|R
50|$|The A-21 <b>retractable</b> antenna was <b>located</b> in {{the rear}} of the {{aircraft}} and was expanded by the air observer while in flight. It could reel out to 300 feet in length, was made out of two copper wires and weighed 19.5 pounds. Depending on the amount of antenna allowed behind the airplane, the antenna functioned at a wavelength of 750 kHz.|$|R
5000|$|The V25-class {{boats were}} {{propelled}} {{by a pair}} of steam turbines manufactured by the shipyard that built each boat. Steam was provided by three oil-fired water-tube boilers. The boats' engines were rated at 33.5 to 34.5 kn from , though most of the ships significantly exceeded these figures, in some cases by almost three knots. The boats had storage capacity for 220 to 338 MT of fuel oil. As a result, cruising radius varied significantly, from [...] at 20 kn, with the first dozen boats having the least endurance. Each vessel was equipped with a pair of [...] 110-Volt turbo-generators for electrical power. Steering was controlled with a pair of rudders; the primary at the stern, and a secondary, <b>retractable</b> rudder <b>located</b> in the bow.|$|R
50|$|The forward lower {{equipment}} room contains the aircraft's water supply tanks, 1200 kVA electrical power panels, step down transformers, VLF transmitter, and SHF SATCOM equipment. An AC/DC powered hydraulic <b>retractable</b> airstair is <b>located</b> {{in the forward}} {{right side of the}} forward lower equipment area, installed for airplane entry and exit. In the event of an emergency, the air stair can be jettisoned. The aft lower lobe contains the maintenance console and mission specific equipment.|$|R
500|$|Sydney and {{her sister}} ships were {{constructed}} from [...] hull plating, with a [...] armour belt over the machinery spaces (the lengthening of this belt from [...] to adequately cover both spaces negated the weight reduction from their reorganisation), and [...] plates over the shell rooms and magazines. Sydney was the first Australian warship fitted with asdic; a Type 125 unit in a retractable pattern 3069 dome. The <b>retractable</b> sonar dome, <b>located</b> near the bow, was a weak point in the hull.|$|R
50|$|Sydney and {{her sister}} ships were {{constructed}} from 1 in hull plating, with a 3 in armour belt over the machinery spaces (the lengthening of this belt from 84 to 141 ft to adequately cover both spaces negated the weight reduction from their reorganisation), and 2 in plates over the shell rooms and magazines. Sydney was the first Australian warship fitted with asdic; a Type 125 unit in a retractable pattern 3069 dome. The <b>retractable</b> sonar dome, <b>located</b> near the bow, was a weak point in the hull.|$|R
5000|$|The {{two main}} {{changes of the}} M.S. 406 were the {{inclusion}} of a new wing structure which saved weight, and the fitting of a <b>retractable</b> radiator, <b>located</b> underneath the fuselage. Powered by the production [...] HS 12Y-31 engine, the new design was over 5 mph faster than the earlier M.S.405 model. Designed to reach speeds of 304 mph, examples were tested without encountering any difficulty in reaching up to 730 km/h when flown in a dive. Armament consisted of a 20 mm Hispano-Suiza HS.9 or 404 cannon with 60 rounds in the V of the engine and fired through the propeller hub, and two 7.5 mm MAC 1934 machine guns (one in each wing, each with 300 rounds). A weakness of the MAC 1934 was its operation at high altitudes. It was found that at altitudes over 6000 m, the guns had a tendency to freeze. Heaters were subsequently added to the guns for high-altitude use.|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to investigate whether}} {{the behavior of the}} asymmetric mean flow observed on pointed bodies of revolution at incidence remains consistent with the presence of a convective instability of an original symmetric flow, even in the incidence range where virtually bistable behavior of the asymmetric flow is observed. By means of a <b>retractable</b> wire <b>located</b> near the tip, it is determined experimentally that for all angles of attack tested (30 to 60 degs), changing the size or location of the controlled disturbance results in a finite change in the asymmetric flow field, even to the extent of reversing the sign of the side force or becoming almost symmetric. The process is reversible; returning the wire to an original position likewise restores the corresponding flow field and mean side force. The effect of wire location (roll angle and distance from the tip) as well as angle of attack and flow conditions are evaluated experimentally by means of flow visualization and side-force measurements for a generic ogive-cylinder model in a low-speed wind tunnel. Evaluation of the results in the light of computational observations and theoretical considerations yields an affirmative answer to the question posed...|$|R
500|$|Myrmecia {{workers and}} queens possess a sting, {{which can be}} fatal to {{sensitive}} human beings. The sting {{has been described as}} [...] "sharp in pain with no burning", and the pain may last for several minutes. In the Starr sting pain scale, a scale which compares the overall pain of hymenopteran stings on a four-point scale, Myrmecia stings were ranked from 2–3 in pain, described as [...] "painful" [...] or [...] "sharply and seriously painful". Unlike in honeybees, the sting lacks barbs, and so the stinger is not left in the area the ant has stung, allowing the ants to sting repeatedly without any harm to themselves. The <b>retractable</b> sting is <b>located</b> in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in some species, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Examined workers of larger species have long and very potent stingers, with some stings measuring [...]|$|R
40|$|The <b>retractable</b> tube is <b>located</b> in {{the upper}} port plug # 3 of ITER core charge {{exchange}} recombination spectroscopy (cCXRS), where it {{is surrounded by a}} set of mirrors, diagnostic shielding module (DSM), outer shell, cleaning device and shutter. Accordingly to the recent port plug concept the tube is an optional unit that carries the cleaning system of the first mirror. The cleaning device shall be a compact instrument at the tube head that influences the tube diameter primarily. Independently of the cleaning device the tube cooling channels and its proper support concept has to be developed. Various manufacturing methods are investigated for the proper layout of the tube cooling structure. They are the gun-drilled deep holes, the solid state bonded sheets forming cooling channels between the welded layers, ‘tube-in-tube’ approach. Most of them were analyzed in view of their thermal conditions. The tube support system design is a complex task, that has to take into account several boundary conditions and limitations. The tube must be compatible with the assumed ITER generic installation procedure, withstand the electromagnetic (EM) and thermal loads. Furthermore, the tube has to be exchanged several times during its lifetime. The paper summarizes the tube cooling layout possibilities and the assumptions on its support concepts...|$|R
500|$|The jack jumper ant and its {{relatives}} in the genus Myrmecia {{are among the most}} dangerous ant genera and have fearsome reputations for their extreme aggression; Guinness World Records certifies the ant Myrmecia pyriformis as the world's most dangerous ant. The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species, such as [...] Brachyponera chinensis, Brachyponera sennaarensis, and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). The <b>retractable</b> sting is <b>located</b> in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated. Exocrine glands are known in jack jumpers, which produce the venom compounds later used to inject into their victims. Their venom contains haemolytic and eicosanoid elements and histamines. It contains a range of active ingredients and enzymatic activity, which includes phospholipase A2 and B, hyaluronidase, acid and alkaline phosphatase. The venom of the ant also contains several peptides; one being pilosulin 1, which causes cytotoxic effects, pilosulin 2, which has antihypertensive properties and pilosulin 3, which is known to be a major allergen. Other pilosulins include pilosulin 4 and pilosulin 5. The peptides have known molecular weights. The LD50 (lethal dose) occurs at a lower concentration than for melittin, a peptide found in bee venom. Its LD50 value is 3.6 mg/kg (injected intravenously in mice).|$|R
40|$|Tests of a partial-span {{model of}} a large bomber-type air 1 ane were {{conducted}} to determine the. aerodynamic characteristics of the wing equipped with full-span flaps and a retractable spoiler end aileron lateral control system. The arrangement consisted of (1) a double slotted flap extending over aproximate 1 y 86 percent of the wing semispan, (2) a 20 -percent constant-percentage-chord aileron extending from the outboard end of the flap to the wing tip, and (3) a <b>retractable</b> spoiler, <b>located</b> at the 65 -percent wing-chord station and extending from approximately 63 percent of the wing semispan to the wing tip. In addition, tests were made of a wing vent (of 1 and 2 percent of the wing chord located directly behind the spoiler), perforations in the spoiler, a blot or cut-out along the lower edge of the spoiler and spoilers of various spans. With full-span flaps deflected and with the 2 -percent vent open or closed the initial stalling of the wing occurred at the tips, but with the vents closed there probably would be no appreciable loss in lateral control until maximum lift was reached. The l-percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoi 1 er deflections, particularly at high angles of attack with flaps deflected. With flaps deflected the 2 -percent vent caused a large reduction in both the wing lift and rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at large angles of attack. However, at small angle of attack the 2 -percent vent increased the rolling effectiveness of the spoiler at small spoiler deflections. The simultaneous operation of the spoiler and vent (in contrast to a vent fixed in the wing) {{would result in a}} large increase in the effectiveness of the spoiler and would avoid any loss in wing lift as in a fixed vent arrangement. The tests of the spoiler modifications revealed that (1) the spoiler perforations reduced the rolling-moment and yawing-moment coefficients but caused the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients to become more positive; (2) the spoiler slot had no notable effect on the rolling-moment and yawing-moment characteristics but produced a positive increase in the spoiler hinge-moment coefficients at large spoiler deflections; (3) the effects produced by the individual modifications were additive when the various modifications were combined. In general, progressively decreasing the spoiler span by removing the segments from the inboard end of the spoiler caused a decrease in rolling effectiveness approximately proportional to the span of the segment...|$|R
50|$|Critics {{usually found}} the fourth {{generation}} acceptable. The car was praised for its adequate handling {{as well as}} a moderately comfortable ride. Other reviewers noted the car to be an ugly and somewhat expensive choice in the compact car segment, some simply referred to it as a Golf with a boot (trunk) on the back added as a last minute addition. Some complaints were made that the back seats lacked adequate room for two adults. Some found the seat cushioning too firm. The interior was praised for the high level of fit, but is quite bland, sparsely equipped, and uninspiring. New in this generation was Volkswagen's signature blue and red instrument lighting which became standard in all models in 1999. The climate controls were placed low on the console. The recirculation mode cannot be turned on when air is vented to the windshield, and if the driver changes the climate control to vent air to the windshield, an internal mechanism would turn off the recirculation mode. The power outlet is recessed next to the ash tray and is covered with two flaps, one of which is shared with the ash tray. Retractable cup holders were placed directly above the stereo, obscuring vision of the stereo display and allowing beverages to spill on the stereo, gear selector, and other sensitive components during erratic vehicle movements. The flimsy plastic construction of the retractable cup holder is likely to fail with normal use. Rear passengers have a pair of <b>retractable</b> cup holders <b>located</b> under the cylindrical ash tray on the center console. These problems were rectified in 2003 for the US market by placing two recessed cup holders in tandem in the center console and another behind the arm rest pedestal for rear passengers. The driver must raise the arm rest to access the center cup holder, and a large beverage occupying the front cup holder obstructs the driver's ability to pull the hand brake. European cars were given a redesigned retractable cup holder in front.|$|R
