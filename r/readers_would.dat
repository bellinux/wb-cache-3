5|$|In an {{interview}} by Scholastic with Rick Riordan for The Lost Hero, Riordan was questioned about {{the whereabouts of}} Percy Jackson. The author hinted that {{the answer would be}} revealed as Jason's quest progressed. By the end of the book, he said that <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> have a good idea where the second book is going. On May 26, 2011, Riordan released both the cover art and the first chapter for The Son of Neptune confirming that Percy would {{play a role in the}} book.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} were {{taught how to}} read by a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who {{devoted his life to}} helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of embossing heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. <b>Readers</b> <b>would</b> trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.|$|E
5|$|The {{practice}} {{became more}} common during the 17th century—11 people were made Benchers between 1600 and 1630—and in 1614 {{one of the}} Benchers appointed was explicitly allowed {{to be a member}} of Pension. This became more common, creating a two-rank system in which both Readers and Benchers were members of Pension. However far more Readers were appointed than Benchers—50 between 1600 and 1630—and it appeared that <b>Readers</b> <b>would</b> remain the higher rank despite this change.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the emperor Lebna Dengel and the Portuguese had {{established}} diplomatic {{contact with each other}} in 1520, Prester John was the name by which Europeans knew the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Ethiopians, though, had never called their emperor that. When ambassadors from Emperor Zara Yaqob attended the Council of Florence in 1441, they were confused when council prelates insisted on referring to their monarch as Prester John. They tried to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, their admonitions did little to stop Europeans from calling the King of Ethiopia Prester John. Some writers who used the title did understand it was not an indigenous honorific; for instance Jordanus seems to use it simply because his <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> have been familiar with it, not because he thought it authentic.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{numerous}} mistakes, Villani often displayed an insider's {{knowledge on}} many subjects, {{as a result}} of his extensive travels and access to both official and private documents. For example, De Vries states that he wrote one of the most accurate accounts of the Battle of Crécy during the Hundred Years' War, including information that the archers were placed precariously behind the English and Welsh infantry, not on the flanks as others asserted. While describing detailed events unfolding within the city, Villani would name every individual street, square, bridge, family, and person involved, assuming his <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> have the same intimate knowledge of Florence as he did.|$|E
5|$|Heyer {{essentially}} {{established the}} historical romance genre and its subgenre Regency romance. Her Regencies {{were inspired by}} Jane Austen, but unlike Austen, who wrote about and for the times in which she lived, Heyer was forced to include copious information about the period so that her <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> understand the setting. To ensure accuracy, Heyer collected reference works and kept detailed notes on all aspects of Regency life. While some critics thought the novels were too detailed, others considered the level of detail to be Heyer's greatest asset. Her meticulous nature was also evident in her historical novels; Heyer even recreated William the Conqueror's crossing into England for her novel The Conqueror.|$|E

5|$|The Inn {{is run by}} Pension, its {{ultimate}} governing body. The name is peculiar to Gray's Inn—at Lincoln's Inn the governing body is called the Council, and at the Inner and Middle Temples {{it is called the}} Parliament. The name was used for the governing bodies of three of the Inns of Chancery—Barnard's Inn, Clement's Inn and New Inn. In Gray's Inn the Readers, when they existed, were required to attend Pension meetings, and other barristers were at one point welcome to, although only the <b>Readers</b> <b>would</b> be allowed to speak. Pension at Gray's Inn is made up of the Masters of the Bench, and the Inn as a whole is headed by the Treasurer, a senior Bencher. The Treasurer has always been elected, and since 1744 the office has rotated between individuals, with a term of one year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Hergé's English {{language}} publishers, Methuen, were planning on translating and publishing The Black Island for the British market. Methuen believed that many British <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> find {{the depiction of}} Britain in the comic inaccurate and out-of-date, and drew {{up a list of}} 131 errors that they asked Hergé to rectify before they would publish it in English. They were also aware that the work would appear particularly dated when compared {{with some of the most}} recently published Adventures like Destination Moon and The Calculus Affair, which made use of advanced technologies in their plot. At the time, Hergé was busy producing the twenty-second Tintin story, Flight 714 to Sydney, and so did not have the time to undertake research into contemporary British society and culture. Instead, he sent his assistant Bob De Moor to Britain in October 1961, where he visited such sites as Batemans and the White Cliffs of Dover, making many observations as to new developments in clothing and architecture. While in England, De Moor sought out various contemporary uniforms to use as a basis for more accurate illustrations. A police constabulary lent him a police uniform, although when he asked British Rail if he could borrow one of their uniforms, their staff were suspicious and refused.|$|E
5|$|Reynolds {{believes}} The Sun Also Rises {{could only}} have been written in 1925: it perfectly captured the period between World WarI and the Great Depression, and immortalized a group of characters. In the years since its publication, the novel has been criticized for its anti-Semitism, as expressed in the characterization of Robert Cohn. Reynolds explains that although the publishers complained to Hemingway about his description of bulls, they allowed his use of Jewish epithets, which showed the degree to which anti-Semitism was accepted in the US after World WarI. Cohn represented the Jewish establishment and contemporary <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> have understood this from his description. Hemingway clearly makes Cohn unlikeable not only as a character but as a character who is Jewish. Critics of the 1970s and 1980s considered Hemingway to be misogynistic and homophobic; by the 1990s his work, including The Sun Also Rises, began to receive critical reconsideration by female scholars.|$|E

5|$|The Historian was {{the first}} debut novel to land at number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale, and as of 2005 was the fastest-selling {{hardback}} debut novel in U.S. history. The book sold more copies on its first day in print than The Da Vinci Code– 70,000 copies were sold {{in the first week}} alone. As of the middle of August 2005, the novel had already sold 915,000 copies in the U.S. and had gone through six printings. (For comparison, according to Publishers Weekly, only ten fiction books sold more than 800,000 hardcover copies in the US in 2004.) Little, Brown and Company also released an edition of Dracula in September 2005 with an introduction by Kostova, thinking her <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> want to delve into the original novel after reading hers. Kostova {{is one of the few}} female bestselling authors, but her popularity is unusual because it is founded on a literary novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the title {{indicates}} that the ‘stories’ are not merely fictitious but have a factual basis in domestic, quotidian life, though <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> understand ‘from real life’ to mean ‘based on’ or ‘adapted from real ‘life’, and not necessarily ‘representation of actual events’. The ‘stories’ are ‘original’ because narratives for children should start afresh in order to avoid continued ideological contamination from vulgar chapbooks or courtly ‘fairy tales’. The phrase ‘real life’ strengthens ‘original’, excluding both the artificial and the fictional or imaginary. ‘Conversations’ suggests familiar, familial discourse rather than formal moralising. ‘Calculated’ suggests a programme rationally determined. These ‘conversations’ and ‘stories’ are also to construct the youthful self in a particular way, by regulating ‘the affections’ or emotional self and forming ‘the mind’ or rational and moral self ‘to truth and goodness’ – understood in terms of professional middle-class culture.|$|E
5|$|William's {{great work}} is a Latin chronicle, written between 1170 and 1184. It {{contains}} twenty-three books; the final book, which deals with the events of 1183 {{and the beginning of}} 1184, has only a prologue and one chapter, so it is either unfinished or the rest of the pages were lost before the whole chronicle began to be copied. The first book begins with the conquest of Syria by Umar in the seventh century, but otherwise the work deals {{with the advent of the}} First Crusade and the subsequent political history of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It is arranged, but was not written, chronologically; the first sections to be written were probably the chapters about the invasion of Egypt in 1167, which are extremely detailed and were likely composed before the Fatimid dynasty was overthrown in 1171. Much of the Historia was finished before William left to attend the Lateran Council, but new additions and corrections were made after his return in 1180, perhaps because he now realized that European <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> also be interested in the history of the kingdom. In 1184 he wrote the Prologue and the beginning of the twenty-third book.|$|E

25|$|Beverly Gray at the World's Fair, {{originally}} the sixth book in Clair Blank's Beverly Gray series, {{was published in}} 1935 and is set at the Century of Progress.

25|$|In 1640, John Benson {{published}} a second {{edition of the}} sonnets in which he changed most of the pronouns from masculine to feminine so that <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> believe {{nearly all of the}} sonnets were addressed to the Dark Lady.

25|$|The {{books were}} only {{published}} in paperback, as the series editor felt <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> not {{be prepared to}} pay the hardback price for an adventure novel.

25|$|Either an {{ellipsis}} or an em dash can indicate aposiopesis, {{the rhetorical}} device {{by which a}} sentence is stopped short not because of interruption, but because the speaker is too emotional or pensive to continue.

25|$|In certain instances, {{the values}} of 17th-century nobility played a major part in the {{literature}} of the era. Most notable of these values are the aristocratic obsession with glory (la gloire) and majesty (la grandeur). The spectacle of power, prestige and luxury found in 17th-century literature may be distasteful or even offensive. Corneille's heroes, for example, have been labeled by modern critics as vainglorious, extravagant and prideful; however, contemporary aristocratic <b>readers</b> <b>would</b> see these characters (and their actions) as representative of nobility.|$|E
25|$|One {{criticism}} of the series came from both Beth L.

However, they rated all six books four out of a six-point scale in which a rating of one is the highest. Meister also commented that themes often revolve around forbidden interClan romances.|$|E
