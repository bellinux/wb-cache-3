Acquiring all medals on Expert Mode unlocks a new title screen for the game; a medal on Venom in Expert Mode allows players to use the Star Fox team as foot soldiers in multiplayer mode.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Mathematics {{seems to}} have a special status when {{compared}} to other areas of human knowledge. This special status is linked with the role of proof. Mathematicians often believe that this type of argumentation leaves no <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> and unclarity. Philosophers of mathematics have differentiated between absolut-ist and fallibilist views on mathematical knowledge, and argued that these views are related to whether one looks at mathematics-in-the-making or finished mathematics. In this paper we {{take a closer look at}} mathe-matical practice, more precisely at the publication process in mathematics. We argue that the apparent view that mathematical literature, given the special status of mathematics, is highly reliable is too naive. We will discuss several problems in the publication process that threaten this view, and give several suggestions on how this could be countered...|$|R

In other words, [...] "steel" [...] must mean steel, [...] "hilt" [...] must mean hilt, [...] "elephant" [...] must mean elephant, and so forth.

2500|$|One of {{the first}} rumbles of the {{conflict}} that was to provide the impetus to create New Formalism as a specific movement, came with the publication in 1977 of an issue of the Mississippi Review called 'Freedom and Form: American Poets Respond'.

Shaw's Comforting the Wilderness, (1977), Charles Martin's <b>Room</b> <b>for</b> <b>Error,</b> (1978) and Timothy Steele's Uncertainties and Rest (1979). In 1980 Mark Jarman and Robert McDowell started the small magazine The Reaper to promote narrative and formal poetry.

The design employs redundancy to relax the DAC settling requirement {{and to provide}} sufficient <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>errors</b> such that the static nonlinearity caused by capacitor mismatches can be digitally removed.

A new code-density based digital background calibration algorithm that requires no special calibration signals or additional analog hardware is also developed. The calibration is performed by using the input signal as stimulus and the effectiveness is verified both in simulation and through measured data. The prototype achieves a 67. 4 dB SNDR at 50 MS/s, while dissipating 2. 1 mW from a 1. 2 V supply, leading to FoM of 21. 9 fJ/conv. -step at Nyquist frequency. MIT Masdar Progra...|$|R

2500|$|In {{the last}} week of June 1956, a new maximum-minimum {{airspeed}} indicator was installed in a Boeing B-47 Stratojet to undergo operational suitability testing. [...] "The new instrument, resembling the standard type indicator, differs in that it will determine the stall speed of an aircraft at any specific time. It will also compute the approach speed of the aircraft to aid the pilot in attaining proper speeds for landing. In the past, with the standard type indicator, pilots have had to determine the approach speed of the aircraft through a mental process of totaling the weight of the fuel load and the operating weight of the aircraft to arrive at the gross weight. This was then applied to a chart to determine the proper approach speed of the aircraft. This method, using the standard indicator, left <b>room</b> <b>for</b> <b>error.</b> With the high speed aircraft of today, pilots must be accurate in determining the speed in order to prevent stalling or approaching the landing strip too fast. The new maximum-minimum air speed indicator is designed to prevent errors that might be made by mental calculations of the pilot. The testing of the new indicator is under the supervision of Major Oliver D. Taylor, 3245th Test Group (Bombardment), Air Force Operational Test Center." ...|$|E
