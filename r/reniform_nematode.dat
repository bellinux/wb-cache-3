40|$|<b>Reniform</b> <b>{{nematode}}</b> is a semi-endoparasitic nematode species causing significant {{yield loss}} in numerous crops, including cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). An RNA-sequencing {{analysis was conducted}} to measure transcript abundance in <b>reniform</b> <b>nematode</b> susceptible (DP 90 & SG 747), resistant (BARBREN- 713), and hypersensitive (LONREN- 1) genotypes of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) with and without <b>reniform</b> <b>nematode</b> infestation. Over 90 million trimmed high quality reads were assembled into 84, 711 and 80, 353 transcripts using the G. arboreum and the G. raimondii genomes as references. Many transcripts were significantly differentially expressed between the three different genotypes both prior to and during nematode pathogenesis, including transcripts corresponding to the gene ontology categories of cell wall, hormone metabolism and signaling, redox reactions, secondary metabolism, transcriptional regulation, stress responses, and signaling. Further analysis revealed {{that a number of}} these differentially expressed transcripts mapped to the G. raimondii and/or the G. arboreum genomes within 1 megabase of quantitative trait loci that had previously been linked to <b>reniform</b> <b>nematode</b> resistance.

40|$|<b>Reniform</b> (Rotylenchulus reniformis) <b>nematodes</b> cost US cotton growers over 130 {{million dollars}} per year. Genetic {{resistance}} of the wild African species Gossypium longicalyx to <b>reniform</b> <b>nematodes</b> was previously transferred into upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). LONREN and other cotton lines containing the responsible gene, Ren^(lon), are highly nematode-resistant, but when grown in nematode-infested fields, the seedlings and plants became "stunted". Hypothesized causes include hypersensitivity reaction, per se, and/or increased susceptibility to soil pathogens. My research objectives have been: [1] to develop Ren^(lon) -linked markers and map the Ren^(lon) region at high resolution, [2] to recombine Ren^(lon) and nearby loci and determine if ?stunting? is due to linkage drag, [3] to create genomic and germplasm resources for genetic manipulation of chromosome- 11, especially Ren^(lon), and [4] to determine if "stunting" is due solely to plant-nematode interactions or involves additional pathogens. Putative SNPs between G. hirsutum and G. longicalyx were collaboratively sequence-aligned to the D 5 reference genome. By selecting SNPs aligned to the Ren^(lon) -homeologous region and screening them against a genetic panel, we identified 85 as Ren^(lon) -linked. To enable large-scale SNP applications, we developed inexpensive methods for high-throughput non-destructive seed DNA extraction for PCR-based genotyping. We then high-resolution mapped 10 SNPs in the proximal alien segment near Ren^(lon). We chose the two closest Ren^(lon) -flanking SNPs and used them for marker-assisted selection to identify 5 recombinants from 17, 600 BC 1 F 1 seed. Subsequent progeny tests indicated 2 of the 5 recombinants were free of "stunting" and that 1 seems to be segregating for nematode resistance. Contingent on verification of the resistance, {{the results indicate that}} stunting of LONREN seedlings is indeed due to linkage drag, not hypersensitivity, per se. To determine if "stunting" can be ascribed solely to hypersensitivity-induced root damage, we conducted three replicated growth chamber experiments with multiple genotypes, pasteurized and natural soils, and several pathogen treatments. The results showed that Thielaviopsis root rot alone can cause severe seedling "stunting", but not the nematodes, alone. Moreover, they showed that LONREN-like genotypes are differentially sensitive to the combined presence of <b>reniform</b> <b>nematodes</b> and Thielaviopsis, and become more severely stunted...|$|R

High levels of resistance to this nematode has not been reported in Gossypium hirsutum, although Gossypium barbadense accession TX 110 has shown a moderate level of resistance to R. reniformis (Yik). TX 110 was crossed with M 315, G. hirsutum, a root-knot (Meloidogyne incognita) resistant line, and screened in order to identify F[2 : 3] progeny resistant to both <b>reniform</b> and root-knot <b>nematodes</b> in a G. hirsutum background. F 2 plants produced from TX 110 /M 315 were screened for early maturity since the TX 110 parent is photoperiodic. A selection of greenhouse-grown F[2 : 3] plants were inoculated with 15, 000 eggs/pot of R. reniformis and screened using eggs counts collected from root and soil samples 10 weeks after inoculation. Resistant plants were transplanted and inoculated with 19, 500 eggs/pot of M. incognita. Approximately 29 weeks after inoculation, nematode eggs were extracted from the roots. These egg counts produced an even distribution not typical of a trait controlled by two genes as reported for root-knot resistance. The eggs were then hatched to ascertain that the eggs were in fact R. reniformis, indicating the reniform populations remaining on the roots following transplanting were able to out-compete M. incognita. The plants that showed low egg densities in the reniform screening also showed low egg densities from the root-knot inoculation where reniform thrived. F[3 : 4] plants derived from these F[2 : 3] reniform resistant plants are currently being screened for root-knot resistance. Additional F[2 : 3] plants were screened for resistance to M. incognita in a manmade sandy soil at the Texas A&M Research Farm.

Includes bibliographical references. <b>Reniform</b> <b>nematode,</b> Rotylenchulus reniformis, {{is a major}} pest of {{pineapple}} (Ananas comosus) {{and many}} vegetable crops in Hawaii reducing yields by 26. 8 - 50 %. Damage thresholds are low (300 - 1000 nematodes/ 250 cm 3 soil) and host-plant resistance is lacking. Therefore management of <b>reniform</b> <b>nematode</b> depends on other tactics. Spirotetramat is a systemic phloem-and-xylem mobility pesticide which acts as a lipid biosynthesis inhibitor. Lipids play a significant physiological role in molting and embryogenesis in plant-parasitic nematodes, hence spirotetramat may provide a viable nematode management tool.

A greenhouse experiment pot experiment where 14 -day-old tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) plants were transplanted, inoculated and treated with spirotetramat to assess nematode penetration. A second greenhouse assays were conducted in which 4 -month-old potted-pineapple plants were treated with different rates of spirotetramat 1 month post-inoculation (Pi) with R. reniformis and terminated at 4 or 10 months post-treatment (Pt) to assess nematode population and plant growth. A third greenhouse trial was conducted in which tomato plants were treated 14 days Pi and terminated 14 days Pt or 28 days Pi to assess nematode fertility. Spirotetramat treatment 14 days prior to inoculation significantly reduced 92 % nematode eggs/g of root. Nematode hatch was similar in all treatments. Penetration was suppressed 100 % at 50 g/ha in the tomato greenhouse experiment. In the pineapple trial, 200 g a. i/ha reduced 93 % nematode eggs/g of root and increased 34 % pineapple growth.

Rotylenchulus parvus was only studied morphologically. A new species, R. macrosomoides sp. n., isolated from soil and roots of sugarcane in South Africa, is described. The phylogeny of Rotylenchulus, as inferred from the analyses of D 2 -D 3 of 28 S rRNA, ITS rRNA, coxI mtDNA and hsp 90 gene sequences, is presented. The study revealed that R. reniformis and R. macrosoma have a sister relationship, but that relationships between other Rotylenchulus species remain unresolved. The phylogenetic analysis also confirmed the hypothesis that this genus originated from the Afrotropical zoogeographical region. Our study revealed that R. reniformis and R. macrosomoides sp. n. have two distinct rRNA gene types and R. macrosoma have three rRNA gene types in their genomes. PCR with species-specific primers was developed for rapid diagnostics of R. reniformis.

40|$|Rotylenchulus reniformis {{is one of}} 10 {{described}} {{species of}} <b>reniform</b> <b>nematodes</b> and is considered the most economically significant pest within the genus, parasitizing a variety of important agricultural crops. Rotylenchulus reniformis collected from cotton fields in the Southeastern US were observed to have the nematode parasitic bacterium Pasteuria attached to their cuticles. Challenge with a Pasteuria-specific monoclonal antibody in live immuno-fluorescent assay (IFA) confirmed the discovery of Pasteuria infecting R. reniformis. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were employed to observe endospore ultrastructure and sporogenesis within the host. Pasteuria were observed to infect and complete their life-cycle in juvenile, male and female R. reniformis. Molecular analysis using Pasteuria species-specific and degenerate primers for 16 s rRNA and spoII, and subsequent phylogenetic assessment, placed the Pasteuria associated with R. reniformis in a distinct clade within established assemblages for the Pasteuria infecting phytopathogenic nematodes. A global phylogenetic assessment of Pasteuria 16 s rDNA using the Neighbor-Joining method resulted in a clear branch with 100 % boot-strap support that effectively partitioned the Pasteuria infecting phytopathogenic nematodes from the Pasteuria associated with bacterivorous nematodes. Phylogenetic analysis of the R. reniformis Pasteuria and Pasteuria spp. parasitizing a number of economically important plant parasitic nematodes revealed that Pasteuria with different host specificities are closely related and likely constitute biotypes of the same species. This suggests host preference, and thus effective differentiation and classification are most likely predicated by an influential virulence determinant(s) {{that has yet to}} be elucidated. Pasteuria Pr 3 endospores produced by in vitro fermentation demonstrated efficacy as a commercial bionematicide to control R. reniformis on cotton in pot tests, when applied as a seed treatment and in a granular formulation.

40|$|Reproduction of <b>reniform</b> <b>nematode</b> Rotylenchulus reniformis on 139 soybean lines was {{evaluated}} in a greenhouse {{in the summer}} of 2001. Cultivars and lines (119 total) were new in the Arkansas and Mississippi Soybean Testing Programs, and an additional 20 were submitted by C. Overstreet, Louisiana State Extension Nematologist. A second test of 32 breeding lines and 2 cultivars from the Clemson University soybean breeding program was performed at the same time under the same conditions. Controls were the resistant cultivars Forrest and Hartwig, susceptible Braxton, and fallow infested soil. Five treatment replications were planted in sandy loam soil infested with 1, 744 eggs and vermiform reniform nematodes, grown for 10 weeks in 10 cm-diam. - pots. Total reniform nematodes extracted from soil and roots was determined, and a reproductive factor (final population (Pf) / initial inoculum level (Pi)) was calculated for each genotype. Reproduction on each genotype was compared to the reproduction on the resistant cultivar Forrest (RF), and the log ratio [logââ(RF + 1) is reported. Cultivars with reproduction not significantly different from Forrest (log ratio) were not suitable hosts, whereas those with greater reproductive indices were considered suitable hosts.

Seventy-six progeny (the 50 most resistant and 26 most susceptible) plants were genotyped with 104 markers. Twenty-five markers were associated with a resistance locus that we designated Renari and two markers, BNL 3279 _ 132 and BNL 2662 _ 090, mapped within 1 Â cM of Renari. Because the SSR fragments associated with resistance were found in G. aridum and the bridging line G 371, G. aridum is the likely source of this resistance. The resistance is simply inherited, possibly controlled by a single dominant gene.

'Forrest' was the most resistant cultivar, whereas 'Braxton' was the most susceptible to R. reniformis.

Cultivars Lee 74, Coker 6955, Waiters, Davis, Pioneer 9442, and Narow did not differ from Braxton (P = 0. 01). Cultivar Lloyd had the second highest reproductive index (Pf/Pi) in 1992 and for the combined test, but was significantly different from Braxton in 1991. The remaining cultivars were inconsistent in their reproductive indices. Two cultivars, Leflore and Lloyd, exhibited large variation in Pf/Pi. This may be due to multiple resistance genes and (or) segregation for resistance among individual seedlings.

Multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant analysis were used to determine the variability of morphology in males and immature females. Reproduction indices of populations were measured on selected soybean and cotton genotypes in the greenhouse. High variability in morphometrics and reproduction was observed within all the populations, and several differences were found among populations. DNA sequences of the nuclear ribosomal first internal transcribed spacer region (ITS 1) were compared among populations from the United States and to sequences of populations from Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, and Japan. No polymorphic nucleotide sites were observed among the amphimictic populations. Only a parthenogenic population from Japan was distinct.

Forty-six medium maturity (mature in 151 - 200 days at Patancheru, India) pigeonpea genotypes were evaluated for resistance and tolerance to the <b>reniform</b> <b>nematode</b> in greenhouse and field tests, over the period 1990 - 97. Each genotype was screened for number of nematode egg masses on a 1 (no egg mass = highly resistant) to 9 (> 50 egg masses = highly susceptible) scale. Plant biomass production in carboftiran-treated plots was compared with that in non-treated plots in a field naturally infested with R. reniformis. Pigeonpea genotypes C 11,ICPL 87119 and ICPL 270 were used as nematode susceptible checks. Genotypes with good plant growth, both in nematode-free and nematode-infested plots, were identified as tolerant and evaluated for plant growth and yield {{for at least three}} years. AH the tested genotypes were susceptible (7 and 9 egg mass. score). Single-plant-selections, based on plant vigour and yield, were made from genotypes showing tolerance to nematode infection. The level of tolerance was enhanced by plant-to-progeny row selection for plant vigour and seed yield in a nematode-sick field for at least three years. The most promising nematode tolerant genotypes produced significantly greater yield and biomass than the locally grown pigeonpea cultivars in fields naturally infested with R. reniformis at two locations.
