5|$|Before Crisis {{opens with}} the trainee Turks {{on a mission}} {{in the city of}} Midgar to {{investigate}} AVALANCHE activities. With help from Reno, AVALANCHE retreat. However, the attack proves to be a diversion for a greater strike at the town of Junon, where President Shinra is set to give a speech. President Shinra is shot, but survives, and calls in Sephiroth. However, it transpires that even the attack on the President was a diversion, and AVALANCHE's real target was a weapon called the Mako Cannon, which they planned to fire at Midgar, destroying the city. Elfé and Sephiroth do battle at the cannon, but the fight ends inconclusively, and AVALANCHE withdraw. AVALANCHE next target <b>Rayleigh</b> a professor carrying data on the SOLDIER members and their creation. The Turks are sent to protect <b>Rayleigh,</b> accompanied by several Shinra guards, including Cloud. Fuhito, a scientist working for AVALANCHE, is able to corrupt Rayleigh's data when the Turks disobey orders and save <b>Rayleigh</b> instead of protecting the information. Using the SOLDIER data, Fuhito develops an elite unit known as the Ravens, using them to capture two SOLDIERs, Essai and Sebastian. The Turks succeed in rescuing the pair, and are then sent to destroy AVALANCHE, accompanied by Zack. Essai and Sebastian, however, are captured once again, and turned into Ravens. Even though Zack is able to bring them back to their senses, he is unable to save them.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rayleigh's</b> {{criterion}} is extensively used in {{optical microscopy}} {{for determining the}} resolution of microscopes. This criterion imposes a resolution limit {{that has long been}} held as an impediment for studying nanoscale biological phenomenon through an optical microscope. However, {{it is well known that}} <b>Rayleigh's</b> criterion is based on intuitive notions. For example, <b>Rayleigh's</b> criterion is formulated in a deterministic setting that neglects the photon statistics of the acquired data. Hence it does not take into account the number of detected photons, which, in turn, raises concern over the use of <b>Rayleigh's</b> criterion in photon-counting techniques such as single-molecule microscopy. Here, we re-examine the resolution problem by adopting a stochastic framework and present a resolution measure that overcomes the limitations of <b>Rayleigh's</b> criterion. This resolution measure predicts that the resolution of optical microscopes is not limited and that it can be improved by increasing the number of detected photons. Experimental verification of the resolution measure is carried out by imaging single-molecule pairs with different distances of separation. The resolution measure provides a quantitative tool for designing and evaluating single-molecule experiments that probe biomolecular interactions...|$|R

5|$|Einstein {{returned}} {{to the problem of}} thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to <b>Rayleigh</b> scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and <b>Rayleigh</b> scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

40|$|Laminated {{rubber bearing}} is a {{significant}} device found in structures such as bridges and buildings. It is used to isolate the foundation and the superstructure from seismic loads. Since it is made up {{from a combination of}} rubbers and steel shim plates in alternate layers which make the laminated rubber bearing a complex material, the measurements of damping of the laminated rubber bearing is difficult in practice. Damping is a dissipation of energy or energy losses in the vibration of the structure when the structures are excited with external dynamic loading. An accurate value of damping is very important as damping plays a crucial role in fixing the borderline between stability and instability in many structural systems. A small amount of damping will have a big influence on the systems. Therefore, it is essential to determine the accurate value of damping in structural analysis especially in finite element analysis. Modal analysis is one of the methods {{that can be used to}} determine dynamic properties including damping in any structures. Hence, the main objectives of this research are to determine the <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients, α andβ and to evaluate the performance of the laminated rubber bearing using modal analysis. There are two methods of modal analysis which are the finite element modal analysis and the experimental modal analysis. Initially, the natural frequencies and mode shapes from both methods are compared and validated. When the natural frequencies and mode shapes are well correlated, the damping ratio values from the experimental modal analysis are used to determine the <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients α and β. The <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients that have been determined by experiment are then inserted in the finite element modal analysis to evaluate the performance of the laminated rubber bearing in term of natural frequencies, mode shapes, minimum displacement and maximum displacement with the addition of <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficient. Based on the finding, the finite element modal analysis with the added <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients α and β shows a good agreement with the experimental modal analysis in term of natural frequencies and mode shapes. The value of natural frequencies reduces after the <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients are added into the finite element modal analysis and the minimum and maximum displacement are found to be unaffected by the <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients. It can be concluded that modal analysis method can be used to estimate the accurate values of damping ratio and to determine the <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients α and β as well. The damping ratio of the first mode from the experimental modal analysis can also be used to determine the <b>Rayleigh's</b> damping coefficients α and β...|$|R
