50|$|At {{the end of}} 2008, GoMusic's website changed both aesthetically and functionally. New scripts {{were added}} to simplify the {{download}} process, especially when buying full albums. For a few months prior to this, all options to pay with a debit or credit card dropped off the site, allowing users to pay only by the telepay method. When credit card funding came back after the site re-design, the minimum amount to <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> went from $20.00 USD to $30.00 USD, and 3 more pricing tiers above $30.00 were added as well.|$|R

5000|$|Pikepass is the {{electronic}} toll collection system used by the Oklahoma Turnpike Authority. Created in 1990 and launched on January 1, 1991, Pikepass provides a faster and cheaper alternative in paying cash tolls. The authority also saves millions with the system. [...] Most customers pay an initial $40 in prepaid tolls, which they can refill at their own convenience or have funds automatically withdrawn to <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account</b> if it falls below $10-15. Pikepass usage results in a 5% savings up front and customers with 20 or more uses of the Pikepass receive a credit of 5% of their toll charges for that month. The Pikepass device has been tested by the manufacturer to accurately record toll usage at speeds up to 123 mi/h km/h.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Highway <b>Account</b> within <b>the</b> Highway Trust Fund is the primary mechanism for funding federal highway programs. <b>The</b> <b>account</b> [...] administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT) [...] channels about $ 33 billion in highway user excise taxes annually to states for highway projects. Although DOT and others projected that <b>the</b> <b>account</b> could run out of funds in fiscal year 2009, the balance fell more rapidly than expected and a shortfall became imminent in August 2008. In September, Congress passed legislation to provide $ 8 billion to <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account,</b> but DOT officials anticipate <b>the</b> <b>account</b> could reach a critical stage again in fiscal year 2009. This report (1) describes the {{events that led to}} the decline in <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance, including how DOT responded, and (2) identifies potential improvements in mechanisms to manage account solvency. This report also includes information on strategies GAO has reported on in the past {{that could be used to}} better align account outlays and revenues. To conduct this work, GAO analyzed information in legal and budget documents, reviewed account estimates, and interviewed agency officials and stakeholders. ...|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Highway <b>Account</b> within <b>the</b> Highway Trust Fund (HTF) is the principal means for funding federal highway programs. Administered by the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) within the Department of Transportation (DOT), it channels about $ 33 billion in highway user excise taxes annually to states for highway and related spending. Estimated outlays from <b>the</b> Highway <b>Account</b> under <b>the</b> Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act [...] A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU) exceeded estimated receipts throughout the authorization period [...] fiscal years 2005 through 2009. Furthermore, actual account receipts were lower than had been estimated and <b>the</b> <b>account</b> balance dropped more rapidly than anticipated, approaching zero in August, 2008. Congress subsequently approved legislation in September 2008 to appropriate $ 8 billion from the General Fund of <b>the</b> Treasury to <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> <b>account.</b> Agency officials anticipate <b>the</b> <b>account</b> will reach a critical stage again {{before the end of}} fiscal year 2009, and estimate that about $ 15 billion will be needed to ensure <b>account</b> solvency through <b>the</b> end of fiscal year 2010. This statement summarizes GAO's past work on 1) the collection and distribution process for <b>the</b> Highway <b>Account</b> of <b>the</b> HTF, 2) options for improving long-term sustainability of the HTF, and 3) mechanisms to help manage Highway Account solvency. ...|$|R
5000|$|While {{the futures}} {{contract}} specifies a trade {{taking place in}} the future, the purpose of the futures exchange is to act as intermediary and mitigate the risk of default by either party in the intervening period. For this reason, the futures exchange requires both parties to put up an initial amount of cash (performance bond), the margin. Margins, sometimes set {{as a percentage of the}} value of the futures contract, need to be proportionally maintained at all times during the life of the contract to underpin this mitigation because the price of the contract will vary in keeping with supply and demand and will change daily and thus one party or the other will theoretically be making or losing money. To mitigate risk and the possibility of default by either party, the product is marked to market on a daily basis whereby the difference between the prior agreed-upon price and the actual daily futures price is settled on a daily basis. This is sometimes known as the variation margin where the futures exchange will draw money out of the losing party's margin account and put it into the other party's thus ensuring that the correct daily loss or profit is reflected in <b>the</b> respective <b>account.</b> If <b>the</b> margin <b>account</b> goes below a certain value set by the Exchange, then a margin call is made and <b>the</b> <b>account</b> owner must <b>replenish</b> <b>the</b> margin <b>account.</b> This process is known as [...] "marking to market". Thus on the delivery date, the amount exchanged is not the specified price on the contract but the spot value (i.e., the original value agreed upon, since any gain or loss has already been previously settled by marking to market). Upon marketing the strike price is often reached and creates lots of income for the [...] "caller".|$|R
