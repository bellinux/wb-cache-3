We estimate the potential {{costs of a}} stewardship program in the Daly River catchment, Northern Territory, which would underwrite the cost difference between <b>routine</b> land <b>management</b> and the additional requirements of conservation management on grazing properties. Based on survey responses from landholders, we first assess the current costs of land management in the catchment and use regression to identify key drivers of spatial variation in both <b>routine</b> land <b>management</b> costs and conservation-oriented management costs. We define conservation-oriented management costs as the costs required to meet objectives for both <b>routine</b> property <b>management</b> and conservation. We then estimate the additional costs of conservation management over and above <b>routine</b> land <b>management</b> {{at an average of}} $ 1. 99 per ha. We conclude that, if the most cost-effective properties are targeted, an annual budget of $ 1 million would support stewardship agreements covering 90 % of the catchment's area. Much of the cost-effectiveness of stewardship payments would come from the significant economies of scale in managing large pastoral properties and leveraging the costs of <b>routine</b> land <b>management</b> already met by landholders...|$|R

40|$|Production {{systems with}} group housing of sows at {{different}} stages of production are increasing in Europe, as an effect of public demand for more animal welfare-friendly pig production. Some niche certified piglet production systems keep lactating sows with piglets in groups in multi-suckling pens. However, three factors have been identified as affecting certified piglet production in systems with multi-suckling pens: The occurrence of lactational oestrus, piglet mortality and within-litter weight variation at weaning. This thesis investigated the possibility to affect these three factors by altering <b>management</b> <b>routines.</b> Three different <b>management</b> <b>routines</b> that differed in terms of time spent in an individual farrowing pen post-farrowing, before the lactating sows with piglets were group-housed in a multi-suckling pen, were created. Time spent in the individual farrowing pen was one (W 1), two (W 2) or three weeks (W 3). Piglets in all <b>management</b> <b>routines</b> were weaned at six weeks post-farrowing. Only one of 43 sows ovulated during lactation. This was determined by post-mortem macroscopic examination of the ovaries and progesterone metabolite concentration in faeces. Interestingly, the weaning to standing oestrus interval was significantly shorter (p< 0. 001) for W 2 (2. 6 ± 0. 3 days) and W 3 (2. 7 ± 0. 2 days) than W 1 (4. 0 ± 0. 3 days). Piglet mortality in the multi-suckling pen was significantly lower (p< 0. 05) in W 3 and W 2 than W 1. Within-litter weight variation did not differ between the <b>management</b> <b>routines.</b> Stress induced by reallocation and mixing of sows can affect ovarian activity and was therefore assessed during the group-housing period by measuring cortisol concentrations in saliva sampled during the first four days post-mixing. Analysis showed that W 3 sows were less stressed in the multi-suckling pen than W 1 sows. Overall, the results in this thesis on sow reproduction and piglet performance can be used for development of housing and <b>management</b> <b>routines...</b>|$|R

50|$|TMJ arthrocentesis {{refers to}} lavage (flushing out) {{of the upper}} joint space (where most of the {{translation}} movement takes place) with saline via the introduction of cannulae. It is theorized that the hydraulic pressure generated within the joint combined with external manipulation is capable of releasing adhesions or the anchored disc phenomenon and leads to an improvement in the movement ("lysis and lavage"). It is also suggested that undesirable contents within the synovial fluid of the joint can be washed out, such as microscopic debris (from breakdown of the articular surfaces) and pain mediators (enzymes and prostaglandins), {{and there is also}} stimulation of the synovial membrane to restore its normal lubricating function. It was initially used to treat acute closed lock, however it has since come to be used chronic closed lock, chronic anterior displaced disc with reduction, and degenerative joint disease (e.g. arthritis). In acute closed lock, it is theorized that the upper joint space is inflated from its normally collapsed state during this procedure, and this extra space frees up the articular disc which returns to its correct position. This is the least invasive, and easiest to carry out of the surgical options. It can be carried out under local anesthetic (and for this reason is cheaper than arthroscopy, although it may also carried out under general anesthetic) and has minimal complications. Although {{it has been suggested that}} arthrocentesis decreases pain, increases maximal incisal opening and has prolonged effects, when the procedure was investigated by a systematic review, the impact on pain was comparable to arthroscopy and the results are unstable. The review concluded by suggesting that arthrocentesis only be used for TMD within well designed randomized controlled trial (i.e. for the purposes of further research and not for <b>routine</b> <b>management).</b> Arthrocentesis may be combined with injection of sodium hyaluronate into the joint at the end of the lavage with the aim to improve lubrication within the joint.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundAlthough high-sensitivity cardiac {{troponin}} (hs-cTn) substantially {{improves the}} {{early detection of}} myocardial injury, it lacks specificity for acute myocardial infarction (MI). In suspected non–ST-elevation MI, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) remains necessary to distinguish between acute MI and noncoronary myocardial disease (eg, myocarditis), unnecessarily subjecting the latter to ICA and associated complications. This trial investigates whether implementing cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) or computed tomography angiography (CTA) early in the diagnostic process may help to differentiate between coronary and noncoronary myocardial disease, thereby preventing unnecessary ICA. Study DesignIn this prospective, single-center, randomized controlled clinical trial, 321 consecutive patients with acute chest pain, elevated hs-cTnT, and nondiagnostic electrocardiogram are randomized to 1 of 3 strategies: (1) CMR, or (2) CTA early in the diagnostic process, or (3) <b>routine</b> clinical <b>management.</b> In the 2 investigational arms of the study, results of CMR or CTA will guide further clinical management. It is expected that noncoronary myocardial disease is detected more frequently after early noninvasive imaging as compared with <b>routine</b> clinical <b>management,</b> and unnecessary ICA will be prevented. The primary end point is {{the total number of}} patients undergoing ICA during initial admission. Secondary end points are 30 -day and 1 -year clinical outcome (major adverse cardiac events and major procedure-related complications), time to final diagnosis, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.
