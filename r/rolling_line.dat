(F. E. A.). A full coupling between several outer races is therefore considered. Analytical ball bearing torque calculations are also developed for deriving simple but powerful relationships giving the friction moments and the location of the pure <b>rolling</b> <b>lines</b> in the contact. The novelty of the study lies in the analytical relationships (as opposed to numerical) which enable the reader to design and optimize easily a bearing for a specific application. Furthermore, the location of the pure <b>rolling</b> <b>lines</b> has been derived without the zero net friction force assumption, which should allow the reader to better predict the bearing kinematics and hence ball – cage pocket clearance and better calculate the friction moments. Useful curve-fitted relationships are also given for defining the Hertzian contact dimensions and pressure, and a methodology is given with appropriate relationships or references for defining the full bearing stiffness matrix, useful when calculating system resonance frequencies. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. The contact {{characteristics}} of stiff cylinders lubricated by Newtonian liquids are investigated using hard elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) theory. Numerical modeling is formulated for the coupled set of generalized pressure and plane strain elasticity equations for a finite plane model and a circular {{representation of the}} junction under a pure hard <b>rolling</b> <b>line</b> contact using boundary element method. Also a numerical routine is developed to compute film thickness and pressure profiles, {{and the results are}} evaluated for a range of possible dimensionless parameters such as speed and load. The hydrodynamic equation is also transformed into a form of boundary integral equation, which is solved by Simpson's rule. The elasticity equation with boundary conditions was solved by constant and quadratic elements based on an iterative procedure by assuming an initial film thickness. The computed results are shown to be amenable to standard boundary element formulation of the EHL problem in the contact region, and show that speed and load have influential effects on the lubricating film shape...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{presenting}} preliminary results from 4 T technology based CMOS image sensors with global shutter, i. e. all pixels {{in the active}} array integrate light simultaneously. The global shutter operation mode is particularly important for high-speed video applications, where the more commonly implemented <b>rolling</b> <b>line</b> shutter creates motion blur. Our chips were fabricated using a 0. 18 micron 4 T, CIS technology with pinned photodiode and transfer gate. Different from conventional 3 T type CMOS image sensors with global shutter pixel, in these 4 T technology based global shutter pixels, the charge is transferred, not just sampled, onto the sense node. This translates into very high sensitivity and low readout noise at low power. For an imager with 7 transistors per pixel that is operated in global shutter, “Integrate While Read ” mode, we measure an input referred noise of 10 electrons. The extinction ratio at full well signal charge is ~ 97. 7 %. 1...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIncreasing {{demands for}} {{transporting}} {{oil and natural}} gas promote the developing and production of high-grade pipeline steel. The hot rolling is a vital process to produce the steel plate of pipe fabrication. In a hot <b>rolling</b> <b>line,</b> a flying shear is used to shear the leading and trailing edges of a rough rolled plate. In the present research, three-dimensional FE model of flying shear was built on ABAQUS/Explicit, considering the motions of blades. The feeding rollers and shear blades are considered as rigid material, and the steel plate adopts elastic-plastic material model. Ductile damage criterion for X 100 steel was built to simulate the material damage and fracture during the shear processing. By the simulation, the plastic deformation, the damage initiation and evolution, the fracture of steel plate can be obtained, which are coincided to production practise. The stroke-force curves of blades were generated from the FE simulation. The shearing force varying with the blade stroke was analyzed. FE simulation shows that the calculated force from FE model is much lower than that from empirical equation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the {{hot rolling}} process, the steel slab may {{experience}} a temperature gradient along its transverse direction which may cause camber and wedge after rolling.

The position mode and the force mode are the control modes for side guides to correct the slab shape and to guide the slab to follow rolling direction. Finite element analysis using ABAQUS was applied to simulate hot rolling process to find the correction mechanism of rolling equipment. The centerline of slab was traced and the shape of slab was predicted. The difference of rolling load between work side and drive side of roller was determined. Furthermore, the load, stress and velocity distribution on the slab at roll bite were analyzed. By using numerical model, hot rolling parameters including side guide control strategy can be predicted, which can provide the hot <b>rolling</b> <b>line</b> as a guideline {{to improve the quality of}} the steel slab...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the effect of friction force on the contact behavior of an elastica inside a circular channel with clearance. The elastica is partially clamped at both the input and output ends of the channel. Coulomb friction {{is assumed to be}} present at the output end and on the constraining walls. Focused is placed on the relative motion between the input end and the output end of the elastica. Shooting method is adopted to solve for the quasi-static behavior of the elastica movement. Four types of contact patterns between the elastica and the constraining channel walls may occur when the input end moves {{in and out of the}} channel; they are rolling point contact, combined rolling and sliding point contact, <b>rolling</b> <b>line</b> contact, and sliding line contact. When the input end undergoes a sinusoidal motion, the output end either ceases to move at all, or follows exactly the input end motion. These two phases of output end motion occur subsequently, one immediately after the other. In general, the output end lags behind the input end. Experimental observations on the lagging phenomenon at the output end confirm the theoretical prediction...|$|E
