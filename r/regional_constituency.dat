The 2003 Labour Party Conference accepted legal advice that the party could not continue to prohibit residents of the province joining, and whilst the National Executive has established a <b>regional</b> <b>constituency</b> party {{it has not yet}} agreed to contest elections there.

500|$|In England, Scotland and Wales, EP {{elections}} were originally held for a constituency MEP on a first-past-the-post basis. [...] In 1999 {{the system was}} changed {{to a form of}} PR where a large group of candidates would stand for a post within a very large <b>regional</b> <b>constituency.</b> [...] One could vote for a party, but not a candidate (unless that party had a single candidate).|$|E

2500|$|Senatorial {{candidates}} are {{chosen by the}} leaders of major political parties or coalitions of parties. [...] The selection process is not transparent and is done in [...] "backrooms" [...] where much political horse-trading occurs. [...] Thus, the absence of regional or proportional representation in the Senate exacerbates a top heavy system of governance, with power centralized in Metro Manila. [...] It has often been suggested that each {{region of the country}} should elect its own senator(s) to more properly represent the people. [...] This will have the effect of flattening the power structure. [...] Regional problems and concerns within a national view can be addressed more effectively. [...] A senator's performance, accountability, and electability become meaningful to a more defined and identifiable <b>regional</b> <b>constituency.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On May 31, 1860, Mocioni was co-opted by the Imperial Diet, which {{contemplated}} administrative reforms {{based on}} new ethnic arrangements. He was an [...] "extraordinary counsel", alongside Andrei Șaguna of Transylvania and Nicolae de Petrino of Bukovina, supporting regional autonomy and the reestablishment and a Romanian Metropolis. By origin, {{all three were}} in fact Aromanians. Reportedly, both Șaguna and Mocioni objected to Diet being non-democratic, and, on this point, agreed with György Apponyi that the delegates only represented themselves. Their objection was registered, but they were asked by Archduke Rainer not to insist on this point. Seen from his <b>regional</b> <b>constituency,</b> Mocioni {{was also one of}} two representatives of the Voivodeship, including the Banat. The other was a Serb prelate, Samuilo Maširević. By September 1860, Mocioni clarified that he considered himself a legitimate Banat and [...] "people's" [...] representative.|$|E

Party chairman Nick Griffin was elected in the North West region, with 8% of the vote. Nationally, the BNP received 6.26%. Griffin stated that it was [...] "a great victory... we go on from here." [...] Meanwhile, the Labour and Conservative parties both {{referred to it as}} a [...] "sad moment". The Archbishops of Canterbury and York said it would be tragic if people abstained or voted BNP at the local and European elections. In local elections held the same day, the BNP also won its first three county council seats in Lancashire, Leicestershire and Hertfordshire. The breakthrough of the British National Party in the 2009 European elections was widely reported throughout Britain by the media. Matthew Goodwin in his article [...] "The BNP's breakthrough", notes that the British National Party was able to capitalise on widespread public anxiety over immigration. Also in light of the United Kingdom Parliamentary expenses scandal, there was media speculation that the BNP could do well in the polls, as voters sought an alternative party to register their protest. Nick Griffin claimed that the success of the British National Party was down to its modernisation, having kept things [...] "simple" [...] and ditched the fringe in the movement who were concerned with [...] "...genetics, Zionism and historical revisionism". He also claimed the party's success was down to the fact the mainstream parties in Britain never discussed immigration, while the British National Party openly did and were not scared to do so: ...|$|E
