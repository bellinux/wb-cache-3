Cyclically ordered group, <b>retract,</b> <b>retract</b> mapping, lexicographic product. MS Classification. 06 F 20, 46 A 40. Cyclically ordered groups were investigated in [1], [9], [...] ., [15]. The notion of cyclically ordered group is a generalization of the notion of linearly ordered group. <b>Retracts</b> of partially ordered sets were studied in [2], [...] .,[5]. <b>Retracts</b> of lattice ordered groups, and in particular, of linearly ordered groups, were investigated in [4]; cf. also [5]. All cyclically ordered groups dealt with in the present note are assumed to be abelian. Let G be a cyclically ordered group. An endomorphismfof G will be said to be a <b>retract</b> mapping if f(f(x) - = f(x) for each x e G. In such a case, the set f(G) is called a <b>retract</b> of G.

In this paper we make some observations that make the connection explicit. We develop four natural transformations between reflexive graphs and bipartite graphs which preserve the property of being an absolute <b>retract,</b> and allow us to derive results about absolute reflexive <b>retracts</b> from similar results about absolute bipartite <b>retracts</b> and conversely. Then we introduce generic notions that specialize to the appropriate concepts in both cases. This paves the way to a unified view of both theories, leading to absolute <b>retracts</b> of general (i. e., partially reflexive) graphs...|$|R
