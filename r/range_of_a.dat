5|$|Extinction is {{the result}} of the {{elimination}} of the geographic <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> species with a reduction of its population size down to zero. The factors that affect biogeographic range and population size include competition, predator-prey interactions, variables of the physical environment, and chance events.|$|E
5|$|Attachment is a {{specific}} binding between viral capsid proteins and specific receptors on the host cellular surface. This specificity determines the host <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> virus. For example, HIV infects a limited range of human leucocytes. This is because its surface protein, gp120, specifically interacts with the CD4 molecule – a chemokine receptor – which is most commonly found {{on the surface of}} CD4+ T-Cells. This mechanism has evolved to favour those viruses that infect only cells in which they are capable of replication. Attachment to the receptor can induce the viral envelope protein to undergo changes that results in the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, or changes of non-enveloped virus surface proteins that allow the virus to enter.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{from their}} 26-yard line after a kickoff, Clemson {{attempted}} to again cut into Tech's lead. The Tigers, again {{guided by the}} running offense of Spiller and Jamie Harper, advanced to the 37-yard line, where Parker's passing attack took over. Parker completed two passes before Georgia Tech defender Jerrard Tarrant ran {{in front of a}} long throw downfield. He intercepted Parker's pass and returned it 50 yards to the Clemson 28, where Tech's offense began anew. Despite the good field position, Tech was unable to gain a first down but still was within <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> 40-yard field goal from Blair, who extended the Yellow Jackets' lead to 33–20.|$|E

This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard suction hose is useful for this task.|$|E

5|$|Lhermitte {{had little}} {{subsequent}} success, and Preneuse returned to Port Louis in early December 1799. The {{entrance to the}} port was blockaded by the 74-gun ship of the line HMS Tremendous under Captain John Osborn (Royal Navy officer)and the 50-gun HMS Adamant under Captain William Hotham. These ships had been sent specifically to intercept Preneuse, arriving at Port Louis on 7 December and successfully intercepting the merchant French vessels Benjamin and Bienfait and the Spanish Nuestra Señora del Carmen. Four days later they sighted the approaching frigate and chased it northeast, Adamant pressing so close that Lhermitte could not escape {{and was forced to}} drive the frigate on shore {{at the mouth of the}} Tombeau River within <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large shore battery.|$|E

O'Neill Communications went out of business in 1993; the LAWN technology was sold to Omnispread Communications. As of 2008, Omnispread continued to sell a variant of O'Neill's LAWN system.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans live a more solitary {{lifestyle}} {{than the}} other great apes. Most social bonds occur between adult females and their dependent and weaned offspring. Adult males and independent adolescents of both sexes tend to live alone. Orangutan societies {{are made up of}} resident and transient individuals of both sexes. Resident females live with their offspring in defined home ranges that overlap with those of other adult females, which may be their immediate relatives. One to several resident female home ranges are encompassed within the home <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> resident male, who is their main mating partner.|$|E

To the north the Japanese had air bases in the Nampo Shoto chain of islands and Bonin Islands, which included three airstrips on Iwo Jima. Several of the minor islands in the Mariana chain also remained in Japanese hands, and there were airfields on Rota and Pagan. The Japanese were unable to use most of these bases, however, as they had been isolated and heavily damaged by United States air attacks, and the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (IJAAF) and Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) had relatively few aircraft and pilots available.|$|E
5|$|When {{someone is}} within <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> trap, a sensor bar will {{move into a}} red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps. Counters on the screen indicate how many perpetrators have entered the house and how many have been captured.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks had special compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E
