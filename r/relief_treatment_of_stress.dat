Although behavioral and surgical therapies are currently the mainstay <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> for this condition, we are hopeful that pharmacotherapy will one day take center stage <b>of</b> the various <b>treatment</b> options. Currently, there are no medications approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> urinary incontinence. However, exciting clinical data are becoming available about an oral medication for the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>stress</b> urinary incontinence {{that appears to be}} clinically safe and efficacious.
