25|$|A {{roof rack}} {{is a common}} trait on many SUV and station wagon vehicles. While <b>roof</b> <b>racks</b> are very useful in {{carrying}} extra storage on a vehicle, they also increase the frontal area of the vehicle and increase the drag coefficient. This is because as the air flows {{over the top of}} the vehicle, following the smooth lines of the hood and windshield, then collides with the roof rack and causes turbulence. The removal of this part has led to increases in fuel efficiency in several studies.|$|E

40|$|Suzuki APV has a {{relatively}} high body compare with others vehicle which are typical, especially if it is using a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> to carry a cargo. With the increase of the central gravity, it will reduce the vehicle stability. Because of that reason, writer {{want to know what}} is the influences of carrying a cargo on <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> to the stability and safety of the vehicle when cornering at high speed on a climbing road or a down road. The stability of a vehicle could be discovered when it’s cornering, because at that time the resultant of Central Gravity Vehicle will transpose into a new position in order to the influences of a centrifugal force that work at the body. Analyze done by varying speed, steering angle and <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> cargo position, and it will gain the centrifugal force that work on vehicle which will affecting the slip angle as a result to the stability of the vehicle by using a skid analysis and rolling analysis. Results from this analysis indicate that the influences of placing a cargo on a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> will make Suzuki APV GA type easier to roll at a low steering angle compare with unload vehicle. Also with placing a cargo on a <b>roof</b> <b>rack</b> will make the vehicle tends to over steer compare with Unload vehicle that act Under Steer...|$|R

5000|$|Drivers {{can also}} {{increase}} fuel efficiency by minimizing transported mass, i.e. {{the number of}} people or the amount of cargo, tools, and equipment carried in the vehicle. Removing common unnecessary accessories such as <b>roof</b> <b>racks,</b> brush guards, wind deflectors (or [...] "spoilers", when designed for downforce and not enhanced flow separation), running boards, push bars, and narrow and lower profile tires will improve fuel efficiency by reducing both weight and aerodynamic drag. Some cars also use a half size spare tire, for weight/cost/space saving purposes. On a typical vehicle, every extra 100 pounds increases fuel consumption by 2%. [...] Removing <b>roof</b> <b>racks</b> (and accessories) can decrease fuel consumption by 20%.|$|E
50|$|Truck bed rack is a {{derivation}} of a {{roof rack}} {{designed to be}} installed over the bed of a pickup truck. The construction of a bed rack {{is very similar to}} a roof rack, but features tall tubes (legs) that allow to lift the rack platform higher above the bed surface and leave space for cargo inside of the bed. Truck bed racks are often used in a combination with <b>roof</b> <b>racks</b> and form a long cargo platform that allows transportation of oversized items. They are commonly used in constructions and recreation as a base for various gear and tents just like the <b>roof</b> <b>racks.</b>|$|E
