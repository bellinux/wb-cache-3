50|$|Unlike most <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs,</b> the shovelnose <b>frogs</b> <b>burrow</b> head-first, {{as opposed}} to rear-first, hence their other common names - snout-burrowers. Some species are kept as pets.|$|R
5000|$|Zakerana rufescens (common names: Malabar wart <b>frog,</b> reddish <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog,</b> or rufescent <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog)</b> is {{a species}} of frog that is endemic to the Western Ghats, India.

50|$|It {{is similar}} to other species of Neobatrachus, {{particularly}} the painted <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog</b> (Neobatrachus pictus), from which it can be distinguished by baggy skin around the groin not being present in N. pictus.

It is controversial whether the species also occurs in India and Nepal. Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical dry shrubland, intermittent freshwater marshes, arable land, and pastureland.It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|Barygenys are <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs.</b> They {{tend to have}} spotty {{distributions}} and {{are rarely}} collected, and consequently poorly known.|$|R
50|$|The Trilling Frog or Desert Trilling Frog (Neobatrachus centralis) is an Australian <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog,</b> of {{the family}} Myobatrachidae.|$|R
50|$|Tomopterna (common names: sand <b>frogs,</b> <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs,</b> Old World bullfrogs) is a genus {{of frogs}} from sub-Saharan Africa.|$|R
25|$|Prior to {{the large}} scale declines of the 1980s, habitat {{destruction}} was the major threat to Australian frog species since colonisation. For example, {{the decline of the}} Giant <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Frog</b> (Heleioporus australiacus) was mostly attributed to altered land use and fire regimes, such as land clearing for housing or agriculture and high intensity fires. The distribution of the Giant <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Frog</b> included Sydney, and therefore, large populations were destroyed.|$|R
50|$|Spencer's <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog</b> (Opisthodon spenceri, {{formerly}} Limnodynastes spenceri) is {{a species}} of frog native to western and central Australia.|$|R
50|$|Hanging swamps {{are home}} to many {{threatened}} and endangered animals: Blue Mountains Water Skink, Giant Dragonfly, and the Giant <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Frog.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sphaerotheca dobsonii (common names: Mangalore bullfrog, Dobson's <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog)</b> is {{a species}} of <b>frog</b> capable of <b>burrowing.</b> It is found in {{southern}} India.|$|R

500|$|The <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs</b> of Australia have {{a rather}} {{different}} lifestyle. The western spotted frog (Heleioporus albopunctatus) digs a burrow beside a river {{or in the}} bed of an ephemeral stream and regularly emerges to forage. Mating takes place and eggs are laid in a foam nest inside the burrow. The eggs partially develop there, but do not hatch until they are submerged following heavy rainfall. The tadpoles then swim out into the open water and rapidly complete their development. Madagascan <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs</b> are less fossorial and mostly bury themselves in leaf litter. One of these, the green <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog</b> (Scaphiophryne marmorata), has a flattened head with a short snout and well-developed metatarsal tubercles on its hind feet to help with excavation. It also has greatly enlarged terminal discs on its fore feet that help it to clamber around in bushes. [...] It breeds in temporary pools that form after rains.|$|R
50|$|Many of {{the true}} frogs are aquatic or live close to water. Most species lay their eggs {{in the water and}} go through a tadpole stage. However, as with most {{families}} of frogs, there is large variation of habitat within the family. Those of the genus Tomopterna are <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs</b> native to Africa and exhibit most of the characteristics common to <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs</b> around the world. There are also arboreal species of true frogs, and the family includes some of the very few amphibians that can live in brackish water.|$|R
50|$|Hildebrandtia is a genus {{of frogs}} in the Ptychadenidae family. They are {{distributed}} in tropical and subtropical Sub-Saharan Africa. The common {{name of this}} genus is Hildebrandt's <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Calluella brooksii is a <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog</b> inhabiting {{the leaf}} litter. Its life history is poorly known. Males call during the day, during heavy showers. Eggs are {{relatively}} small and pigmented.|$|R
50|$|Glyphoglossus molossus is {{a species}} of frog in the Microhylidae family. It is {{monotypic}} within the genus Glyphoglossus. Its common names are Blunt-headed <b>Burrowing</b> <b>Frog</b> and Balloon Frog, among others.|$|R

50|$|This species {{looks very}} similar to Spencer's <b>burrowing</b> <b>frog,</b> Opisthodon spenceri and some Neobatrachus species. It is {{distinguished}} from all of these species by the reduced webbing and mating call.|$|R
50|$|The {{common name}} of these frogs is {{globular}} frogs or balloon frogs {{in reference to}} their stout appearance. These medium-sized (maximum snout-vent length 2.5 - 3 in) <b>burrowing</b> <b>frogs</b> eat ants and termites.|$|R
