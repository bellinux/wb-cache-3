The artist employs old blankets that are worn with use, faded in color, and stretched out of shape to evoke memories of the many ways blankets comfort and protect us from birth until death. Forget-Me-Not: Mothers and Sons (2008) is an installation piece conceived in response to Watt 2 ̆ 7 s dissatisfaction with {{media coverage of the}} Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and the young lives lost in combat. Desiring to personalize and humanize the stories of soldiers killed in the wars, she created a series of small, hand-stitched memorial portraits. In the installation, the cameo-like portraits hang from a web made from <b>reclaimed</b> <b>wool</b> blankets that surrounds and envelopes the viewer. An accompanying, more abstract piece titled Blossom, comprised of hundreds of handmade fabric blooms and a large basalt stone, memorializes the civilian lives lost in the wars. This paper examines Watt 2 ̆ 7 s use of 2 ̆ 2 reclaimed 2 ̆ 2 wool blankets to create {{a very different kind of}} war memorial, one that employs color, texture, and story to stir memory and emotion, that builds a sense of community and creates an intimate space for contemplation and remembrance. Watt draws inspiration from Joseph Beuys 2 ̆ 7 s concept of social sculpture, his interest in the creative potential of all people, and his belief that art can and should have a role in shaping society and the world...|$|E

[...] "Wool" [...] is [...] "the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the {{so-called}} specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product". [...] "Virgin wool" [...] and [...] "new wool" [...] are also {{used to refer to}} such never used wool. There are two categories of recycled <b>wool</b> (also called <b>reclaimed</b> or shoddy <b>wool).</b> [...] "Reprocessed wool" [...] identifies [...] "wool which has been woven or felted into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer". [...] "Reused wool" [...] refers to such wool that has been used by the ultimate consumer.|$|R
