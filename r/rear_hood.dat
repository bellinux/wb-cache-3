2500|$|The [...] LS-4 {{big-block}} V8 {{engine was}} offered delivering [...] and 15% {{of the cars}} were ordered so equipped. “454” emblems adorned the hood of big-block equipped Corvettes. All models featured a new cowl induction domed hood, which pulled air in through a <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> intake into the engine compartment under full throttle, increasing power (but didn't {{show up in the}} horsepower ratings). 0-60 times were reduced by a second while keeping the engine compartment cooler. The new tire size was GR70-15 with white stripes or raised white letters optional. An aluminum wheel option was seen on 1973 and 1974 pilot cars, and a few 1973s were so equipped, but withheld for quality issues, and wouldn't be available until 1976.|$|E
2500|$|The first postwar Pontiac {{available}} (September 13, 1945) was the Streamliner coupe, which {{remained the}} sole product for a time. The Chieftain trim level of 1942 was renamed the Deluxe trim level in 1946. Styling highlights of Pontiacs were wraparound bumpers, a massive 14 blade grille, new nameplates and concealed safe-light parking lamps. Streamliners {{could be identified}} by straight back Indian moldings on the <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> ornament chrome beltline moldings and bright moldings on the [...] "speedline" [...] fender ribs. They also had longer front fender crown moldings and were generally larger in size. Lettering on hood emblems and badges placed forward of the [...] "speedlines" [...] identified Eights.

A total of 92,731 Streamliners were sold in 1946, accounting for over two thirds of all Pontiacs.|$|E

Larger emblem was still used on the <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> in place of HP emblem until supplies ran out and was replaced with the small emblem (i.e. both small and large SPRINT emblems may be found on <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> on late models). Also, smaller SPRINT emblems were used as replacements on early models. 13-inch Hands aluminum mag wheels: 5-lug, 8-slot mags w/3-prong spinner for 65 and later (few were so equipped due to the scarcity of these wheels. Fitch himself could not locate a set for his Phoenix).|$|E

5000|$|The model 244 {{diesel engine}} {{used in the}} RSC-24 program saw their {{horsepower}} derated to [...] In {{order to make the}} locomotive suitable for weight-restricted light rail branch lines, MLW built the locomotives using a switcher frame as a start, resulting in the [...] "squashed" [...] appearance of a road switcher. This was largely the result of a very short <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> housing the electrical cabinet, whereas electrical cabinets were normally located in the long hood on most road switcher designs. In order to make the locomotive suitable for weight-restricted light rail branch lines, MLW spread the weight over the rail surface using A1A-A1A trucks (2 powered axles, 1 unpowered axle) which were manufactured by Dominion Foundries and Steel (DOFASCO); this same truck was also adopted for the MLW RSC-13. This resulted in less traction, hence the need to de-rate the engine horsepower to avoid wheel slippage.|$|E

5|$|Soleil's {{squadron}} departed Rochefort on {{the evening}} of 24 September, aiming to bypass Hood's squadron in the dark. However at 01:00 on 25 September, with the wind coming from the northeast, lookouts on HMS Monarch spotted sails to the east. Hood's squadron was spread out, tacking southeast towards the Chassiron Lighthouse at Saint-Denis-d'Oléron with HMS Centaur in the centre, HMS Revenge to the east (or windward) and Monarch to the west. HMS Mars was also close by, {{with the rest of the}} squadron spread out in the <b>rear.</b> <b>Hood's</b> immediate reaction was that the sails must belong to a squadron of French ships of the line, and ordered his ships to form a line of battle in anticipation. Even as the signal was raised however, lookouts on Monarch identified the strangers as frigates and Hood abandoned his previous orders and raised a new signal ordering a general chase, confident that his ships could destroy the convoy even without the power and defensive capability of a line of battle.|$|R
2500|$|Despite {{overall length}} {{increasing}} by , the second generation's weight dropped by {{nearly a hundred}} pounds.

50|$|In 1968 the RPB Piraya was introduced. It was a low, two seated kit {{car with}} gullwing-doors {{inspired}} by the Ford GT40 and made for a Volkswagen Beetle chassis. It sold 40 kits {{in less than a}} year, but some customers found it difficult to assemble the cars. In 1969 the RPB-GT was introduced. Prices started at 3800 SEK. The design was similar to the Piraya, but had normal front hinged doors. The kit was made easier to assemble for the customer. The GT sold well, most as kits, but some as completed cars. It used a fuel tank from Renault 10, hinges to the front and <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> came from Renault 4, door handles and locks from Renault 16, door hinges and side windows (cut to size) from the Mini, the front screen from a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette, rear and front lights were Hella universal (although the same headlight units was also used in Saab 96, Saab 99 and Renault 16).|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{overall length}} {{increasing}} by 7.5 in, the second generation's weight dropped by {{nearly a hundred}} pounds.

40|$|The head, torso, {{and lower}} {{extremity}} {{are the most}} commonly injured body regions during vehicle-to-pedestrian crashes. A total of 312 cases were selected from the National Automotive Sampling System (NASS) Pedestrian Crash Data Study (PCDS) database to investigate factors affecting the likelihood of sustaining MAIS 3 +, AIS 3 + head, AIS 3 + torso, and AIS 2 + lower extremity injuries during vehicle-to-pedestrian frontal crashes. The inclusion criteria were pedestrians: (a) aged 14 years or older, (b) with a height of 1. 5 m and taller, and (c) who were injured in an upright standing position via vehicle frontal collision. The injury odds ratios (ORs) calculated from logistic regression analyses were {{used to evaluate the}} association between selected injury predictors and the odds of sustaining pedestrian head, torso, and lower extremity injuries. These predictors included a crash factor (impact speed), pedestrian factors (age, gender, height, and weight), and vehicle factors (front bumper central height, front bumper lead, ground to front/top transition point height (FTTPH), and <b>rear</b> <b>hood</b> opening distance (RHOD)). Results showed that impact speed was a statistically significant predictor for head, torso, and lower extremity injury odds, as expected. Comparison of people 65 years of age and older to young adults aged 14 to 64 showed that age was also a significant predictor for torso (p< 0. 001, OR= 23. 8) and lower extremity (p= 0. 020, OR= 2. 44) injury odds, but not for head injuries (p= 0. 661). Vehicles with higher FTTPH and more vertical frontal structures were aggressive to pedestrians, especially regarding injuries to the torso. A very short RHOD {{would be more likely to}} lead the pedestrian to impact the windshield and windshield frame, thus increasing the head injury risk...|$|E
