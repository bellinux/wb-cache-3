5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied to <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E

He was similarly reluctant to relieve the capable but overcautious Joseph E. Johnston until, after numerous frustrations which he detailed in a March 1, 1865 letter to Col.

In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order to <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{the corps}} began {{a number of}} {{training}} initiatives with the Republic of Korea Army.

These operations were designed to keep the corps familiar with commanding during large-scale conventional warfare, as opposed to counter-insurgency tactics it employed during its two tours in Iraq. Upon return to the United States, the corps conducted similar exercises at Fort Hood.|$|E
5|$|In United States federal courts, {{a circuit}} split occurs when {{two or more}} {{different}} circuit courts of appeals provide conflicting rulings on the same legal issue.

5|$|In the game, {{the player}} must <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> murder mystery by searching for clues, {{exploring}} different areas, interacting with characters, and solving item-based puzzles. The game features first-person graphics, nonlinear gameplay, an open world, conversations with non-player characters, branching dialogue choices, suspect interrogations, nonlinear storytelling, and plot twists. The Famicom version {{also features a}} command menu system, point-and-click interface, and 3D dungeon maze. Upon its release, The Portopia Serial Murder Incident was well received in Japan. It became an influential title and helped define the visual novel genre.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} part of the constellation to the northwest of the Pleiades lies the Crystal Ball Nebula, known by its catalogue designation of NGC 1514. This planetary nebula is of historical interest following its discovery by German-born English astronomer William Herschel in 1790. Prior to that time, astronomers had assumed that nebulae were simply unresolved groups of stars. However, Herschel could clearly <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> star at the center of the nebula that was surrounded by a nebulous cloud of some type. In 1864, English astronomer William Huggins used the spectrum of this nebula to deduce that the nebula is a luminous gas, rather than stars.|$|E

Poor performances from Botham and Mike Gatting's injury ensured an easy series win for the West Indies.

Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
