40|$|Muscle {{spindles}} {{are commonly}} considered as stretch receptors encoding movement, but the functional consequence of their efferent control has remained unclear. The "alpha-gamma coactivation" hypothesis states that activity in a muscle is {{positively related to}} the output of its spindle afferents. However, {{in addition to the}} above, possible reciprocal inhibition of spindle controllers entails a negative relationship between contractile activity in one muscle and spindle afferent output from its antagonist. By <b>recording</b> <b>spindle</b> afferent responses from alert humans using microneurography, I show that spindle output does reflect antagonistic muscle balance. Specifically, regardless of identical kinematic profiles across active finger movements, stretch of the loaded antagonist muscle (i. e., extensor) was accompanied by increased afferent firing rates from this muscle compared with the baseline case of no constant external load. In contrast, spindle firing rates from the stretching antagonist were lowest when the agonist muscle powering movement (i. e., flexor) acted against an additional resistive load. Stepwise regressions confirmed that instantaneous velocity, extensor, and flexor muscle activity had a significant effect on spindle afferent responses, with flexor activity having a negative effect. Therefore, the results indicate that, as consequence of their efferent control, spindle sensitivity (gain) to muscle stretch reflects the balance of activity between antagonistic muscles rather than only the activity of the spindle-bearing muscle...|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) -related sleep disturbances {{have been reported}} early in AIDS. Likewise, the feline {{immunodeficiency virus}} (FIV), a natural lentivirus pathogen of cats, produces a similar immunodeficiency syndrome with neurological sequelae. To identify the neurophysiological substrate of FIV infection in brain, pathogen-free cats were infected with the Maryland strain of FIV. Eight weeks after inoculation, all FIV-infected cats seroconverted and virus was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and in the mononuclear cells of peripheral blood. Ten to 12 months after the FIV inoculation, inoculated and control cats were surgically implanted with electrodes to record the sleep/wake cycle. These sleep recordings were obtained under conditions controlling for environmental variables and instrumental adaptation. FIV-infected cats spent 50 % more time awake than the sham-inoculated controls and exhibited many more sleep/waking stage shifts [...] i. e., 40 % more than controls. In addition, FIV-infected cats showed approximately 30 % of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep reduction compared to controls. The latency to sleep and REM sleep onset was also significantly delayed in FIV-infected cats. In addition, a remarkable increase in cortically <b>recorded</b> <b>spindle</b> activity (8 - 13 Hz) was observed during slow-wave sleep in some infected subjects, similar to changes described in HIV-infected humans. Moreover, infected cats exhibited no overt signs of systemic morbidity, such as hyperpyrexia or body weight loss. These results indicate that FIV-infected cats exhibit sleep abnormalities similar to the sleep disturbances previously described in AIDS patients and further support the feline preparation as a valuable animal model of HIV infection of the central nervous system...|$|R
40|$|A spindle {{detection}} method was developed that: (1) extracts the signal of interest (i. e., spindle-related phasic changes in sigma) relative to ongoing 2 ̆ 2 background 2 ̆ 2 sigma activity using complex demodulation, (2) accounts for variations of spindle characteristics across the night, scalp derivations and between individuals, and (3) employs a {{minimum number of}} sometimes arbitrary, user-defined parameters. Complex demodulation was used to extract instantaneous power in the spindle band. To account for intra- and inter individual differences, the signal was z-score transformed using a 60 s sliding window, per channel, {{over the course of}} the <b>recording.</b> <b>Spindle</b> events were detected with a z-score threshold corresponding to a low probability (e. g., 99 th percentile). Spindle characteristics, such as amplitude, duration and oscillatory frequency, were derived for each individual spindle following detection, which permits spindles to be subsequently and flexibly categorized as slow or fast spindles from a single detection pass. Spindles were automatically detected in 15 young healthy subjects. Two experts manually identified spindles from C 3 during Stage 2 sleep, from each recording: one employing conventional guidelines, and the other, identifying spindles with the aid of a sigma (11 - 16 Hz) filtered channel. These spindles were then compared between raters and to the automated detection to identify the presence of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives. This method of automated spindle detection resolves or avoids many of the limitations that complicate automated spindle detection, and performs well compared to a group of non-experts, and importantly, has good external validity with respect to the extant literature in terms of the characteristics of automatically detected spindles...|$|R

40|$|Individuals with obesity {{are more}} likely to fall and exhibit balance instability. The reason for this is likely multifactorial, but there is some {{evidence}} that sensory function is impaired during obesity. We tested the hypothesis that muscle proprioceptor function is compromised in a mouse model of diet induced obesity. We used an in vitro muscle-nerve preparation to <b>record</b> muscle <b>spindle</b> afferent responses to physiological stretch and sinusoidal vibration. We compared the responses of mice on a control diet (10 % kcal fat) with those eating a high fat diet (60 % kcal fat) alone or in combination with either aspirin (120 mg/kg/day in drinking water) or rosiglitazone (0. 01 % in chow) for 10 weeks. Following high fat diet feeding, adult mice exhibited decreased muscle spindle afferent responses to stretch and lower dynamic sensitivity. Treatment with aspirin or rosiglitazone did not completely rescue muscle spindle afferent responsiveness. Due to the importance of muscle spindle afferents to proprioception and motor control, decreased muscle spindle afferent responsiveness may contribute to balance instability during obesity. Future studies should test this hypothesis in the human population...|$|R

Here, it is investigated whether brain oscillations during sleep at baseline, particularly sleep spindles, are predictive of treatment response. Twenty-four participants with chronic primary insomnia {{took part in a}} 6 -week CBT-I performed in groups of 4 to 6 participants. Treatment response to CBT-I was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) measured at pre- and post-treatment.

40|$|Many {{recent studies}} on the {{segmental}} motor control system have employed spike-triggered-averaging (STA) {{and other forms of}} cross-correlation to either attribute CNS, reflex, or direct motor effects to the impulses of a single (reference) neuronal spike train or to explore conditions under which pairs of neural units show temporal correlations in their discharge. Our experience with these techniques suggested the need for a control procedure that tests for synchrony between the reference and other spike trains such as to: (1) either preclude that the observed effects are due to spike trains other than or in addition to the reference train; or (2) give insight into the conditions leading to correlated discharge between two units. A motor unit synchronization test based on analysis of EMG waveforms has already been described. We have modified this test for the detection of synchrony between either afferent or efferent signals by analysis of averaged muscle nerve signals rather than EMG waveforms. Our procedure involves use of a multi-unit muscle nerve recording that serves as the input to a signal averager triggered by a spike train from either: (1) a motor unit's EMG; (2) a dorsal root filament or ganglion cell; or (3) a ramdom trigger source. With appropriate delay of the muscle nerve signal input, the non-rectified average of the trigger signal's waveform is compared to the rectified average which contains this waveform together with contributions of all other active unitary events. Additionally, the rectified average is compared to a "randomly" triggered average of the same input signal. On the basis of these recordings, it can be determined, within certain boundary conditions, whether or not any other unitary events are in synchrony with the reference event. Such synchronization is expressed quantitatively {{in the form of a}} synchronization index (SI). We evaluated the efficacy of the SI by electronic simulation procedures and by comparing its use to that of a cross-correlation procedure that tests for synchrony on the basis of crosscorrelograms computed between two simultaneously <b>recorded</b> <b>spindle</b> afferent spike trains during brief stretch of a passive muscle at progressively increasing amplitudes (5 - 100 um). These experiments revealed that the SI is a sensitive test of afferent synchrony in the passive muscle provided the spike trains of interest have a signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio > 0. 2 in the muscle nerve recording and that it is recognized that the detectable degree of synchronization of a non-reference event is a function of its S/N ratio. For tests on the active muscle, the force levels must remain low. Otherwise increased neuronal activity in the muscle nerve recording decreases the S/N ratio of individual spike trains. Thus, despite restrictive (but predictable) boundary conditions, the SI test can contribute importantly to select conclusions drawn from cross-correlation studies...|$|R

40|$|Subjects {{with active}} stretch {{reflexes}} responded to an imposed sinusoidal {{movement of the}} ankle joint with a reflex force whose amplitude and timing varied widely with changes {{in the frequency of}} movement. At some frequency between 6 and 8 Hz, the reflex force tended to offset the non-reflex component of resistance, and thus to reduce the total resistance to movement. At this frequency the reflex response was particularly vigorous, with a deep modulation of electromyogram (e. m. g.) activity and a displacement of the joint stiffness vectors far from their high frequency values. The total resistance to movement might then be small, or it might be zero, or the reflex might actually assist the movement. As the frequency of movement was decreased through this critical range, the timing of the reflex response to movement changed rapidly with an abrupt advancement of the triceps surae e. m. g. signal, and a wide separation of the joint stiffness vectors as they passed close to the origin. This result was attributed to a changing distribution of the movement between the muscle fibres and an elastic Achilles tendon. It was assumed that at most frequencies the muscle fibres resisted extension, so that {{a major part of the}} imposed movement went into stretching the tendon; when, however, at 6 - 8 Hz, the reflex response was so timed as to reduce or abolish the resistance of the muscle fibres, more of the movement would take place in them. The muscle spindles would 'see' this larger movement of the muscle fibres, and generate correspondingly more reflex activity. A simplified model of the muscle-tendon combination behaves in a way that supports this view, and the available information about the human Achilles tendon indicates that it is sufficiently compliant for such an explanation. Therefore, movements imposed on the ankle joint would not necessarily be 'seen' by the muscle spindles, since they would be modified by transmission through a compliant tendon. By assuming a value for the tendon stiffness, it was possible to calculate the course of movements that actually occurred in the muscle fibres and <b>spindles.</b> <b>Records</b> of these <b>spindle</b> movements indicated how some non-linearities might arise.

40|$|Background: The muscle spindle is an {{important}} sensory organ for proprioceptive information, yet {{there have been few}} attempts to use Shannon information theory to quantify the capacity of human muscle spindles to encode sensory input. Methods: Computer simulations linked kinematics, to biomechanics, to six muscle spindle models that generated predictions of firing rate.

The models were then used to predict firing rates during random movements with statistical properties matched to the ergonomics of human wrist movements.

For simulated random movements these models predicted mean rates of 16. 0 ± 4. 1 imp/s (mean ± SD), peak firing rates < 50 imp/s and zero firing rate during an average of 25 % of the movement.

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} effect of limb {{movement}} speed on dorsal spinocerebellar tract (DSCT) activity recorded while the cat hindlimb was passively moved through two types of foot trajectories (figure eight and step cycle) at different speeds. While nearly all the DSCT neurons sampled (151 / 159; 94. 5 %) were significantly modulated by the direction of foot movement in these trajectories, they were only modestly influenced by movement speed. We quantified the speed effect and also accounted for intrinsic cell variability by computing a variability index (VI) between pairs of responses to trajectories made either at the same or at different speeds. The distribution of same-speed VIs across cells indicated a mean variability of about 10 % over a trajectory cycle, whereas the two-speed distributions indicated a mean change of about 25 % for a two- to fourfold change in movement speed. We also examined the relative contribution of movement speed to the activity of each DSCT cell {{by means of a}} multivariate regression model that also included as predictors the position, movement direction, and interactions between movement and position. We found that 28 of 103 (27. 2 %) neurons were not sensitive to movement speed. The rest were modulated in varying degrees by changes in speed, and the speed modulation depended on limb position for most of them (54 / 75). Overall, DSCT speed sensitivity resembles the 0. 3 -power relationship used to describe the velocity sensitivity of muscle spindles for large muscle stretches. We examined this by <b>recording</b> muscle <b>spindle</b> activity during these passive foot trajectories and found that their speed sensitivity was within the range observed for the DSCT and explained by the 0. 3 -power law. In total, movement speed accounted for about 15 % of the variance in DSCT activity across cells, while the directional component of movement accounted for about 45 %. The results suggest a separate processing of sensory information about the two components of movement velocity: namely, its direction and magnitude...|$|R

A long-standing hypothesis suggests that a high arousal threshold during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep is mediated by sleep spindle oscillations, impairing thalamocortical transmission of incoming sensory stimuli. Here we set out to test this idea directly by examining sensory-evoked neuronal spiking activity during natural sleep. Methods: We compared neuronal (n = 269) and multiunit activity (MUA), as well as local field potentials (LFP) in rat core auditory cortex (A 1) during NREM sleep, comparing responses to sounds depending on {{the presence or absence of}} sleep spindles. Results: We found that sleep spindles robustly modulated the timing of neuronal discharges in A 1. However, responses to sounds were nearly identical for all measured signals including isolated neurons, MUA, and LFPs (all differences < 10 %). Furthermore, in 10 % of trials, auditory stimulation led to an early termination of the sleep spindle oscillation around 150 250 msec following stimulus onset. Finally, active ON states and inactive OFF periods during slow waves in NREM sleep affected the auditory response in opposite ways, depending on stimulus intensity. Conclusions: Responses in core auditory cortex are well preserved regardless of sleep <b>spindles</b> <b>recorded</b> in that area, suggesting that thalamocortical sensory relay remains functional during sleep spindles, and that sensory disconnection in sleep is mediated by other mechanisms...|$|R

Maintained reciprocal thalamocortical connectivity was demonstrated by VB stimulation, which elicited orthodromic and antidromic responses in the cortex, along with re-entry of thalamocortical firing originating in VB neurons excited by cortical output activity. In addition, orthodromic responses were recorded in VB and RTN following stimuli delivered in the cortex. Spontaneous and stimulus-induced coherent rhythmic oscillations (duration = 0. 4 - 3. 5 s; frequency = 9 - 16 Hz) occurred in cortex, VB, and RTN during application of medium containing low concentrations of the K(+) channel blocker 4 -aminopyridine (0. 5 - 1 microM). This activity, which resembled electroencephalograph (EEG) <b>spindles</b> <b>recorded</b> in vivo, disappeared in both cortex and thalamus during application of the excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist kynurenic acid in VB (n = 6). By contrast, cortical application of kynurenic acid (n = 4) abolished spindle-like oscillations at this site, but not those recorded in VB, where their frequency was higher than under control conditions. Our findings demonstrate the preservation of reciprocally interconnected cortical and thalamic neuron networks that generate thalamocortical spindle-like oscillations in an in vitro rat brain slice. As shown in intact animals, these oscillations originate in the thalamus where they are presumably caused by interactions between RTN and VB neurons. We propose that this preparation may help to analyze thalamocortical synchronization and to understand the physiopathogenesis of absence attacks...|$|R
40|$|There is {{evidence}} in experimental animals that, {{in addition to}} receiving fusimotor drive, muscle spindles are subject to modulation by the sympathetic nervous system. We examined the validity of this idea in human subjects by <b>recording</b> from muscle <b>spindles</b> in the relaxed ankle and toe extensor muscles during a strong and sustained physiological activation of muscle sympathetic outflow. Unitary recordings were made from 20 primary and 17 secondary muscle spindle afferents via a tungsten microelectrode inserted percutaneously into the peroneal nerve in 10 awake, healthy subjects seated with the legs supported in the extended position. ECG, blood pressure, respiration and calf circumference were also recorded. The majority of the muscle spindles were spontaneously active at rest; a background discharge was induced in four silent spindles by vibrating the tendon. A sustained increase in muscle vasoconstrictor activity, an increase in calf volume and a fall in pulse pressure were produced by subjects performing a 30 - 40 s maximal inspiratory breath-hold. Despite this strong increase in muscle sympathetic outflow no significant changes occurred in the discharge of either primary or secondary muscle spindle afferents, measured as a change in mean frequency and variability over sequential 5 s epochs and compared with the preceding period of rest. Strong chemoreceptor-driven sympathetic bursts during sustained expiratory breath-holds also failed to modulate the firing of 14 spindle endings. We conclude that a sustained, physiological increase in muscle sympathetic activity causes no detectable change in muscle spindle firing, lending no support to the concept that the sympathetic nervous system can influence the sensitivity of human muscle spindles directly...|$|R
40|$|Simultaneous {{recordings}} {{were made}} from fusimotor axons in the central ends of filaments of the masseter nerve, and from masseter and temporalis spindle afferents in the mesencephalic nucleus of the fifth cranial nerve in lightly anaesthetized cats. Fusimotor and alpha-motor units in the masseter nerve were differentiated {{on the basis of}} their response to passive ramp and hold stretches applied to the jaw. Spindle afferents were identified as primary or secondary according to their dynamic index after administration of suxamethonium. The activity of a given fusimotor unit during reflex movements of the jaw followed one of two distinct patterns: so-called 'tonic' units showed a general increase in activity during a movement, without detailed relation to lengthening or shortening, while 'modulated' units displayed a striking modulation of their activity with shortening, and were usually silent during subsequent lengthening. Comparison of the simultaneously <b>recorded</b> fusimotor and <b>spindle</b> afferent activity suggests that modulated units may be representative of a population of static fusimotor neurones, and tonic units of a population of dynamic fusimotor neurones. In these lightly anaesthetized animals, both primary and secondary spindle afferents showed increased firing during muscle shortening as well as during lengthening. This increase during shortening is not usually seen in conscious animals and reasons are given for the view that it is due to greater depression of alpha-motor activity than of static fusimotor activity during anaesthesia. The results are discussed in relation to the theories of 'alpha-gamma co-activation' and of 'servo-assistance'; and it is suggested that static fusimotor neurones provide a 'temporal template' of the intended movement, while dynamic fusimotor neurones set the required dynamic sensitivity to deviations from the intended movement pattern...|$|R
40|$|During Non-Rapid Eye Movement sleep (NREM) {{the brain}} is {{relatively}} disconnected from the environment, while connectedness between brain areas is also decreased. Evidence indicates that these dynamic connectivity changes are delivered by microstructural elements of sleep: short periods of environmental stimuli evaluation followed by sleep promoting procedures. The connectivity patterns of the latter, among other aspects of sleep microstructure, are still to be fully elucidated. We suggest here a methodology for the assessment and investigation of the connectivity patterns of EEG microstructural elements, such as sleep spindles. The methodology combines techniques in the preprocessing, estimation, error assessing and visualization of results levels {{in order to allow}} the detailed examination of the connectivity aspects (levels and directionality of information flow) over frequency and time with notable resolution, while dealing with the volume conduction and EEG reference assessment. The high temporal and frequency resolution of the methodology will allow the association between the microelements and the dynamically forming networks that characterise them, and consequently possibly reveal aspects of the EEG microstructure.

40|$|Experiments were {{addressed}} to the following questions: when a muscle nerve is sectioned and regenerates {{to what extent are}} muscle receptors (spindles and tendon organs) reinnervated? is the reinnervation specific? that is, do group Ia and spindle group II fibres preferentially reinnervate spindles and do group Ib fibres preferentially reinnervate tendon organs? what are the consequences to the afferent of failure to re-establish appropriate receptor innervation? In normal cats, and in cats 3, 6 or 9 months after section and resuture of the medial gastrocnemius muscle nerve, medial gastrocnemius afferent fibres in continuity were impaled in dorsal rootlets for recording and stimulation. Receptor innervation was determined electrophysiologically by manipulation of the medial gastrocnemius muscle. Afferent fibre type was determined by the presence (group Ia or spindle group II) or absence (group Ib) of field potentials in the homonymous motoneurone pool in response to activation of the afferent fibre. In normal cats, two-thirds of recorded afferents innervated spindles; 89 % of these generated field potentials detected in the motoneurone pool. One-third of recorded afferents innervated tendon organs; none of these generated such field potentials. In operated cats, about half of the <b>recorded</b> afferents innervated <b>spindles,</b> about one-third responded abnormally or not at all to muscle manipulation, and fewer than one-tenth innervated tendon organs. Numbers of afferents which innervated spindles increased with time. The proportion of afferents generating field potentials was smaller in operated than in normal animals (40 % vs. 60 %) and declined progressively with time. Field potentials were generated by fibres in all categories of receptor reinnervation. This ability was lost at long post-operative intervals by fibres failing to reach the muscle. Conduction velocity of fibres fell in operated animals. Fibres reinnervating their original type of receptor (e. g. group Ia fibre [...] spindle) exhibited greater conduction velocity than fibres innervating an inappropriate receptor or no receptor. From these findings and other considerations (see Discussion) we conclude that following section and resuture of the medial gastrocnemius muscle nerve: about 75 % of afferents regenerate into the medial gastrocnemius muscle, many more spindles than tendon organs become reinnervated, random populations of groups Ia and Ib (and probably spindle group II) fibres reinnervate spindles, fibres which fail to re-establish appropriate receptor innervation also fail to recover normal conduction velocity.
