40|$|In {{the process}} of design, {{development}} and certification of a turbo-prop Light Transport Aircraft (LTA), an important aspect is to establish the installed performance of the engine before carrying out actual flight tests. In this context, it is relevant to study and analyse behaviour of the engine air intake performance before commencing actual flight tests. CFD analysis of flow {{in and around the}} nacelle and engine air intake duct was carried out using two RANS based models, S-A and SST k-omega using the commercial software ANSYS Fluent. Special emphasis was laid on developing a good quality mesh for the computational domain with a finer boundary layer mesh along the wall and by maintaining a higher density mesh at critical areas. <b>Ram</b> air <b>recovery</b> and mass flow rate of main air intake duct has been established from the results obtained. The results obtained from the CFD study have shown that the inlet system pressure loss and <b>ram</b> air <b>recovery</b> are within limits prescribed by the engine original equipment manufacturer. From the overall analysis, total pressure total pressure recovery at the plenum was found satisfactory for all flight cases, covering variation in the Mach number, altitude and nacelle AOA. Inlet pressure losses obtained by CFD computations are in good agreement with experimental results.

40|$|ABSTRACT Rapid {{inactivation}} of Ca 2 + release-activated Ca 2 + (CRAG) channels was {{studied in}} Jurkat leukemic T lymphocytes using whole-ceU patch clamp recording and [Ca 2 +]i measurement techniques. In {{the presence of}} 22 mM extracellular Ca 2 ยง the Ca z+ current declined with a biexponential time course (time constants of 8 - 30 ms and 50 - 150 ms) during hyperpolarizing pulses to potentials more negative than- 40 inV. Several lines of evidence suggest that the fast inactivation process is Ca 2 + but not voltage dependent. First, the speed and extent of inactivation are enhanced by conditions that increase the rate of Ca 2 + entry through open channels. Second, inactivation is substantially reduced when Ba 2 + is present as the charge carrier. Third, inactivation is slowed by intracellular dialysis with BAPTA (12 raM), a rapid Ca 2 + buffer, but not by raising the cytoplasmic concentration of EGTA, a slower chelator, from 1. 2 to 12 <b>raM.</b> <b>Recovery</b> from fast inactivation is complete within 200 ms after repolarization to- 12 mV. Rapid inactivation is unaffected by changes {{in the number of}} open CRAC channels or global [Ca 2 +]i. These results demonstrate that rapid inactivation of lc~c results from the action of Ca z+ in close proximity to the intracellular mouths of individual channels, and that Ca 2 + entry through one CRAC channel does not affect neighboring channels. A simple model for Ca z+ diffusion {{in the presence of a}} mobile buffer predicts multiple Ca z+ inactivation sites situated 3 - 4 nm from the intracellular mouth of the pore, consistent with a location on the CRAC channel itself...|$|E
40|$|The Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) {{system was}} used as a basis for {{describing}} a methodology for the management of reproduction in small ruminant flocks. The seven principles of the HACCP system are: 1. Conduct a hazard analysis 2. Identify critical control points 3. Establish critical limits for each control point 4. Establish monitoring procedure 5. Establish corrective actions 6. Establish a record keeping procedure 7. Establish verification procedures. The first principle of HACCP requires a description of the production system. The small ruminant reproduction process was subdivided into four sub-processes with a total of 33 phases. The ewe management cycle consists of 12 phases and the ram management cycle, replacement ewe cycle and replacement ram cycle each consists of seven phases. The reproductive process was described by a flow diagram. The hazards were categorized as management, environmental, nutritional, genetic, predatory, physiological and disease factors that could affect reproductive performance. The second principle requires the establishment of Critical Control Points (CCP). Seventeen CCPs in the reproductive process were established and monitoring and diagnostic procedures for each of the critical control points was described together with suggested corrective actions. The resulting HACCP plan formed the basis of consultations with 30 commercial small stock enterprises. Each of the Critical Control Points was applied to at least three and up to 30 of the flocks over the period of the trial to establish the practicality and validity of the procedures which were described as standard operating procedures. Data forms were designed for the structured collection of data regarding the process as well as the CCPs. The Critical Control Points and forms that were selected in this project were as follows: CC 1. Ewe selection. Prior to Ewe preparation. Ewe selection data form CC 2. Ram selection. Prior to Phase two of ram preparation. Ram selection data form CC 3. Ewe preparation. Prior to start of mating (end of flushing period). Ewe preparation data form CC 4. Ram preparation.

Ram genital soundness data form CC 16. <b>Ram</b> <b>recovery.</b> About 8 weeks after mating. <b>Ram</b> <b>recovery</b> data form CC 17. Last day of lambing. About 146 days after end of joining. Last day of lambing data form. In addition to the specific procedures described in the seventeen CCP's three CCP's were described that can be performed to assist in monitoring the general health and welfare of the flock at strategic points in the management cycle: CC 18 Body condition score CC 19 Helminthic status CC 20 Nutritional status. Qualitative aspects of the critical control point as well as certain quality control questions were described as a generic quality control form. This generic form is modified annually to reflect hazard issues that need to be followed up the following year. Specific questions are entered on the form which is diarised for the next year. The use of these generic forms assisted in the process of continuous improvement by ensuring that adjustments to the Flock Health and Production Plan are made to prevent repeating management failures. Examples of the use of the CCP's are described on the basis of data that was collected from the flocks that participated in the project. Upon conclusion a questionnaire was completed by 12 / 25 of the flock managers who participated. The results of the survey indicated that there was general acceptance of a HACCP โ based management system for the management of reproduction in the small ruminant enterprises by the flock managers that responded to the questionnaire. Flock managers agreed that the program must be adapted to their individual needs, would not be a problem to implement but needed to be simple and many would need assistance. Training and information was considered important aspects. There was general consensus that financial results should form part of the program and that comparisons within the group on an anonymous basis is accepted. The two responses that showed the least variance were the needs to reduce production risk and to be informed of potential hazards. Flock managers disagreed the most in their response about the range of control points they would implement. This correlates with the expressed need to have individually adapted programs. Flock managers were not very positive about the benefits of a quality control and certification system. Predation proved {{to be the most important}} hazard followed by parasites and stock theft, all three being highly variable as indicated by a large variance. The HACCP-based methodology should be applied in and extended form to all aspects of the flock production system to assist in improving sustainability.

40|$|Several {{methods of}} pumping air to an annular cooling passage {{surrounding}} a typical axial-flow turbojet-engine afterburner were evaluated and compared {{on the basis}} of thrust and specific fuel consumption of the systems. Each system was analyzed over a range of afterburner-wall temperatures, flight Mach numbers, and exhaust-gas temperatures at sea level and 35, 000 feet. <b>Ram</b> pressure <b>recovery,</b> boundary-layer pressure recovery, and the engine-jet actuated ejector appear to be satisfactory systems at high Mach numbers. Cooling with compressor-exit air bleed was found to be unsatisfactory,but the use of compressor-exit bleed air as the primary fluid in a high-performance ejector was satisfactory. The use of an auxiliary compressor driven from the engine shaft increased the thrust and decreased the specific fuel consumption of the engine for many of the conditions investigated...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. The design and {{evaluation}} of off-takes has traditionally focused on increasing <b>ram</b> pressure <b>recovery</b> with little consideration given to flow uniformity. Preliminary studies on a proposed cooled cooling air system for a large aero gas turbine indicated that the offtake represented a weak point in the design with the non-uniformities it generated negatively affecting system performance. High levels of diffusion and a uniform flow are required to minimise loss and to maximise {{the effectiveness of the}} downstream heat exchanger. This paper presents a numerical and experimental parametric study of parallel wall flush off-takes with focus placed {{on the quality of the}} downstream flow and its uniformity. A realisable k-omega turbulence closure was employed with a standard wall function to examine the pressure recovery and uniformity of flush off-takes. The performance of the off-take was investigated with different inflow boundary layer thicknesses in conjunction with changes in various design parameters. The current investigation highlights that there exists a direct trade-off between the diffusion and uniformity that can be achieved by a flush offtake. Nevertheless, the work provides an improved understanding of how each performance parameters can be maximised with respect to uniformity and this knowledge is currently being applied to the development of an optimal off-take design...|$|R
