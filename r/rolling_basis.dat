2500|$|The {{main reason}} to control directors’ power over share allottments and issues {{is to prevent}} shareholders’ rights being watered down if new shares are created. Under CA 2006 section 561, {{existing}} shareholders have a basic pre-emption right, to be offered any new shares first in proportion to their existing holding. Shareholders have 14 days {{to decide whether to}} buy. There are a series of exceptions under CA 2006 sections 564-567, for issuing bonus shares, partly paid shares, and employee shares, while private companies can opt out of pre-emption rules altogether. Furthermore, by special resolution (a three-quarter majority vote) under CA 2006 sections 570-571, shareholders may disapply pre-emption rights. In practice, large companies frequently give directors ad hoc authority to disapply pre-emption rights, but within the scope of a ‘Statement of Principles’ issued by asset managers. At present, the most influential guide is the document by the Institutional investors’ Pre-emption Group, Disapplying Pre-emption Rights: A Statement of Principle (...) [...] This suggests that the general practice is to disapply the pre-emption rights on a <b>rolling</b> <b>basis</b> for routine share issues (e.g. shares subject to a clawback) at no more than 5% of share capital each year.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{outlines the}} procedure and certain {{results of the}} experimental analysis of the strain and stress conditions in a billet during flat rolling. The photo-plasticity method of experimental stress {{analysis was used to}} solve the concerned problems. This application for evaluating stress and strain conditions allows to determine the directions as well as the differences of the main strains in the deformed material. The obtained data can then be used to deal with the static conditions of equilibrium by applying the shear stress difference method and the successive approximation method. What exists among the specified results is the comparison of experimental source materials obtained under both the conventional rolling process and multi-layer material <b>rolling</b> (the <b>basis</b> of the accumulative roll bonding process). The main attention was focused on the stress and strain conditions in both procedures. Web of Science 641615...|$|R

However, in {{industrial}} situations uncertainties in demand {{may have a}} considerable influence on the efficiency of an MRP system. Therefore lot sizing and safety stock decisions should also be investigated under conditions of uncertain demand.

Simulation results are presented for {{a case study of}} a Belgian firm facing high forecast errors. Results are also presented for a hypothetical simulation experiment which was designed in order to gain insight into the cost effectiveness of single level lot sizing heuristics when applied on a <b>rolling</b> schedule <b>basis</b> with demand uncertainty.
