40|$|In {{order to}} address the lack of {{reliable}} indicators of corruption, this article develops a composite indicator of high-level institutionalised corruption through a novel ‘Big Data’ approach. Using publicly available electronic public procurement records in Hungary, we identify “red flags” in the public procurement process and link them to restricted competition and <b>recurrent</b> <b>contract</b> award to the same company. We use this method to create a corruption indicator at contract level that can be aggregated {{to the level of}} individual organizations, sectors, regions and countries. Because electronic public procurement data is available in virtually all developed countries from about the mid- 2000 s, this method can generate a corruption index based on objective data that is consistent over time and across countries. We demonstrate the validity of the corruption risk index by showing that firms with higher corruption risk score had relatively higher profitability, higher ratio of contract value to initial estimated price, greater likelihood of politicians managing or owning them, and greater likelihood of registration in tax havens, than firms with lower scores on the index. In the conclusion we discuss the uses of this data for academic research, investigative journalists, civil society groups, and small and medium business. This is the author accepted manuscript.

40|$|Despite {{thirty years}} of {{research}} in interorganizational networks and project business within the industrial networks approach and relationship marketing, collective capability of networks of business and other interorganizational actors has not been explicitly conceptualized and studied within the above-named approaches. This is {{despite the fact that}} the two approaches maintain that networking is one of the core strategies for the long-term survival of market actors. Recently, many scholars within the above-named approaches have emphasized that the survival of market actors is based on the strength of their networks and that inter-firm competition is being replaced by inter-network competition. Furthermore, project business is characterized by the building of goal-oriented, temporary networks whose aims, structures, and procedures are clarified and that are governed by processes of interaction as well as <b>recurrent</b> <b>contracts.</b> This study develops frameworks for studying and analysing collective network capability, i. e. collective capability created for the network of firms. The concept is first justified and positioned within the industrial networks, project business, and relationship marketing schools. An eclectic source of conceptual input is based on four major approaches to interorganizational business relationships. The study uses qualitative research and analysis, and the case report analyses the empirical phenomenon using a large number of qualitative techniques: tables, diagrams, network models, matrices etc. The study shows the high level of uniqueness and complexity of international project business. While perceived psychic distance between the parties may be small due to previous project experiences and the benefit of existing relationships, a varied number of critical events develop due to the economic and local context of the recipient country as well as the coordination demands of the large number of involved actors. The study shows that the successful creation of collective network capability led to the success of the network for the studied project. The processes and structures for creating collective network capability are encapsulated in a model of governance factors for interorganizational networks. The theoretical and management implications are summarized in seven propositions. The core implication is that project business success in unique and complex environments is achieved by accessing the capabilities of a network of actors, and project management in such environments should be built on both contractual and cooperative procedures with local recipient country parties...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{with chronic}} granulomatous disease (CGD), an {{inherited}} disorder of phagocytic cells, often <b>contract</b> <b>recurrent</b> life-threatening bacterial and fungal infections. CGD is considered to arise from a functional defect of the O 2 -generating {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADPH) oxidase in phagocytes. To determine whether or not NADPH oxidase is crucial to the host defence against Mycobacterium avium, we investigated the response against M. avium using CGD model mice (gp 91 -phox-) of C 57 BL/ 6 strain. A tracheal injection of 1 × 107 colony-forming units (CFU) /head of M. avium strain FN into the CGD mice resulted in a pulmonary infection, while also increasing the mortality rate. In contrast, normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice injected with same dose of the organisms did not develop severe pulmonary infection and were able to survive through 2 months of observation. The macrophages obtained from the CGD mice were observed to have a higher burden of the bacterial growth than macrophages from normal C 57 BL/ 6 mice. These results suggest that the defect of the NADPH oxidase function impairs the host defence against M. avium infection...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Understanding of scabies immunopathology {{has been}} {{hampered}} by the inability to undertake longitudinal studies in humans. Pigs are a useful animal model for scabies, and show clinical and immunologic changes {{similar to those in}} humans. Crusted scabies can be readily established in pigs by treatment with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex). METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Prospective study of 24 pigs in four groups: a) Scabies+/Dex+, b) Scabies+/Dex-, c) Scabies-/Dex+ and d) Scabies-/Dex-. Clinical symptoms were monitored. Histological profiling and transcriptional analysis of skin biopsies was undertaken to compare changes in cell infiltrates and representative cytokines. A range of clinical responses to Sarcoptes scabiei were observed in Dex treated and non-immunosuppressed pigs. An association was confirmed between disease severity and transcription of the Th 2 cytokines IL- 4 and IL- 13, and up-regulation of the Th 17 cytokines IL- 17 and IL- 23 in pigs with crusted scabies. Immunohistochemistry revealed marked infiltration of lymphocytes and mast cells, and strong staining for IL- 17. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: While an allergic Th 2 type response to scabies has been previously described, these results suggest that IL- 17 related pathways may also contribute to immunopathology of crusted scabies. This may lead to new strategies to protect vulnerable subjects from <b>contracting</b> <b>recurrent</b> crusted scabies...|$|R
40|$|Scabies is a {{neglected}} tropical skin disease {{caused by the}} tiny parasitic mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is common in developing countries, and scabies outbreaks also occur in institutional settings worldwide. Scabies often underlies secondary bacterial skin infection and resulting complications, and is thus associated with considerable morbidity. Crusted scabies is a an extremely severe and debilitating clinical form of the disease, but host immune responses leading {{to the development of}} crusted or ordinary scabies are poorly understood. This is largely due to limited access to clinical samples, and the difficulty in monitoring the progression of infestation in human patients. We have overcome this challenge by using a pig model of scabies infestation, since pigs and humans with scabies display clinical and immunological similarities. In this study, we undertook longitudinal analysis of clinical, histological and molecular immunological changes in pigs experimentally infected with scabies. We confirmed that disease severity was associated with a pronounced allergic, Th 2 immune response, as previously reported. In a novel finding, we showed that the Th 17 associated cytokines interleukin- 17 and interleukin- 23 were also associated with the development of crusted scabies. This may lead to new immunotherapeutic strategies to protect vulnerable subjects from <b>contracting</b> <b>recurrent</b> crusted scabies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{proprietary}} {{extract from}} North American ginseng (Panax quinquefolium), COLD-FX ® (CVT-E 002), {{has been found}} to be effective in the prevention of upper respiratory infections in a number of different groups including institutionalized seniors, community-dwelling seniors and healthy adults. These effects of COLD-FX are thought to be mediated by its ability to stimulate both the natural and acquired immune systems. Excessive exercise has been known to induce immune suppression and to increase the susceptibility for <b>contracting</b> <b>recurrent</b> upper respiratory tract infections. The purpose of the present study, therefore, was to determine if COLD-FX supplementation to players of National Hockey League caliber would be effective in altering the response of their leukocytes to influenza virus ex vivo. Periph-eral blood leukocytes (PBLs) were isolated from 2 groups of NHL players and immediately cultured for 2. 5 days in the presence of 3 strains of influenza virus. One group (n= 18) had been taking COLD-FX (400 mg/day) for 30 days, while the control group (n= 19) was supplement free. Cultured PBLs isolated from those taking COLD-FX (400 mg/day) and stimulated with 3 strains of influenza virus released more TNF-α and IL- 2, however, moderated granzyme-B release. This indicates that COLD-FX supplementation enhanced cell-mediated immune response of PBLs to influenza viruses and likely moderated the levels of cytotoxic T-cell effector molecules, sustained release of which may lead to autoimmune conditions. Additional studies on elite athletes, whose immune systems may be compromised, are warranted...|$|R

Results are based on data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 4. 6 fb - 1 of proton-proton collisions at ps = 7 TeV, collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. In order to discriminate between signal and background events, kinematic and topological quantities, including the angular spin correlations of the decay products, are employed. Events are further classiéd according to the probability of the jets to originate from quarks of light or heavy avor or from gluons. No evidence for the Higgs boson is found, and upper limits on its production cross section are determined for a Higgs boson of mass between 130 and 600 GeV.

A search for physics beyond the standard model involving events with one or more photons, jets, and missing transverse energy has been performed by the CMS experiment. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4. 93 fb- 1 of proton-proton collisions at √s = 7 TeV, produced at the Large Hadron Collider. No excess of events with large missing transverse energy is observed beyond expectations from standard model processes, and upper limits on the signal production cross sections for new physics processes are set at the 95 % confidence level. The results of this search are interpreted in the context of three models of new physics: a general model of gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking, Simplified Models, and a theory involving universal extra dimensions.

The inclusive b-jet production cross section in pp collisions at a center-ofmass energy of 7 TeV is measured using data collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. The cross section is presented as a function of the jet transverse momentum in the range 18 < pT < 200 GeV for several rapidity intervals. The results are also given as the ratio of the b-jet production cross section to the inclusive jet production cross section. The measurement is performed with two different analyses, which differ in their trigger selection and b-jet identification: a jet analysis that selects events with a b jet using a sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34 pb - 1, and a muon analysis requiring a b jet with a muon based on an integrated luminosity of 3 pb - 1. In both approaches the b jets are identified by requiring a secondary vertex. The results from the two methods are in agreement with each other and with next-to-leading order calculations, as well as with predictions based on the pythia event generator.

Measurements are presented by the CMS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) of the higher-order harmonic coefficients that describe the azimuthal anisotropy of charged particles emitted in sNN= 2. 76 TeV PbPb collisions. Expressed in terms of the Fourier components of the azimuthal distribution, the n= 3 - 6 harmonic coefficients are presented for charged particles as a function of their transverse momentum (0. 3 <pT< 8. 0 GeV/c), collision centrality (0 %- 70 %), and pseudorapidity (|η|< 2. 0). The data are analyzed using the event plane, multiparticle cumulant, and Lee-Yang zeros methods, which provide different sensitivities to initial-state fluctuations. Taken together with earlier LHC measurements of elliptic flow (n= 2), the results on higher-order harmonic coefficients develop a more complete picture of the collective motion in high-energy heavy-ion collisions and shed light on the properties of the produced medium. © 2014 CERN, for the CMS Collaboration.

The first {{measurement}} of jet shapes, {{defined as the}} fractional transverse momentum radial distribution, for inclusive jets produced in heavy-ion collisions is presented. Data samples of PbPb and pp collisions, corresponding to integrated luminosities of 150 μb- 1 and 5. 3 pb- 1 respectively, were collected at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of √sNN= 2. 76 TeV with the CMS detector at the LHC. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-kT algorithm with a distance parameter R = 0. 3, and the jet shapes are measured for charged particles with transverse momentum pT > 1 GeV/c. The jet shapes measured in PbPb collisions in different collision centralities are compared to reference distributions based on the pp data. A centrality-dependent modification of the jet shapes is observed in the more central PbPb collisions, indicating a redistribution of the energy inside the jet cone.

A search for new physics is performed in multijet events with large missing transverse momentum produced in proton-proton collisions at √s = 8 TeV using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19. 5 fb - 1 collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample is divided into three jet multiplicity categories (3 - 5, 6 - 7, and ≥ 8 jets), and studied further in bins of two variables: the scalar sum of jet transverse momenta and the missing transverse momentum. The observed numbers of events in various categories are consistent with backgrounds expected from standard model processes. Exclusion limits are presented for several simplified supersymmetric models of squark or gluino pair production.

A search for the standard model Higgs boson decaying to a W-boson pair at the LHC is reported. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4. 9 fb− 1 and 19. 4 fb− 1 collected with the CMS detector in pp collisions at s√ = 7 and 8 TeV, respectively. The Higgs boson candidates are selected in events with two or three charged leptons. An excess of events above background is observed, consistent with the expectation from the standard model Higgs boson with a mass of around 125 GeV. The probability to observe an excess equal or larger than the one seen, under the background-only hypothesis, corresponds to a significance of 4. 3 standard deviations for m H = 125. 6 GeV. The observed signal cross section times the branching fraction to WW for m H = 125. 6 GeV is 0. 72 + 0. 20 − 0. 18 times the standard model expectation. The spin-parity J P = 0 + hypothesis is favored against a narrow resonance with J P = 2 + or J P = 0 − that decays to a W-boson pair. This result provides strong evidence for a Higgs-like boson decaying to a W-boson pair.

The production of a Z boson, decaying into two leptons and produced in association with one or more b jets, is studied using proton-proton collisions delivered by the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. The data were recorded in 2011 with the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb- 1. The Z(ℓℓ) + b-jets cross sections (where ℓℓ = μμ or ee) are measured separately for a Z boson produced with exactly one b jet and with at least two b jets. In addition, a cross section ratio is extracted for a Z boson produced with at least one b jet, relative to a Z boson produced with at least one jet. The measured cross sections are compared to various theoretical predictions, and the data favour the predictions in the five-flavour scheme, where b quarks are assumed massless. The kinematic properties of the reconstructed particles are compared with the predictions from the MadGraph event generator using the pythia parton shower simulation.

A search for supersymmetry in final states with jets and missing transverse energy is performed in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of √s= 7 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 4. 98 fb- 1 collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC. In this search, a dimensionless kinematic variable, αT, is used as the main discriminator between events with genuine and misreconstructed missing transverse energy. The search is performed in a signal region that is binned in the scalar sum of the transverse energy of jets and the number of jets identified as originating from a bottom quark. No excess of events over the standard model expectation is found.

When scaled by the geometric eccentricity of the collision zone, the elliptic anisotropy is found to obey a universal scaling with the transverse particle density for different collision systems and center-of-mass energiesFinally, we acknowledge the enduring support for the construction and operation of the LHC and the CMS detector provided by the following funding agencies: the Austrian Federal Ministry of Science and Research; the Belgian Fonds de la Recherche Scientifique, and Fonds voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; the Brazilian Funding Agencies (CNPq, CAPES, FAPERJ, and FAPESP); the Bulgarian Ministry of Education, Youth, and Science; CERN; the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ministry of Science and Technology, and National Natural Science Foundation of China; the Colombian Funding Agency (COLCIENCIAS); the Croatian Ministry of Science, Education, and Sport; the Research Promotion Foundation, Cyprus; the Ministry of Education and Research, <b>Recurrent</b> Financing <b>Contract</b> No. SF 0690030 s 09 and European Regional Development Fund, Estonia; the Academy of Finland, Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture, and Helsinki Institute of Physics; the Institut National de Physique Nucléaire et de Physique des Particules/CNRS, and Commissariat à l’Ènergie Atomique et aux Énergies Alternatives/CEA, France; the Bundesministerium fur Bildung und Forschung, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, and Helmholtz-Gemeinschaft Deutscher Forschungszentren, Germany; the General Secretariat for Research and Technology, Greece; the National Scientific Research Foundation, and National Office for Research and Technology, Hungary; the Department of Atomic Energy and the Department of Science and Technology, India; the Institute for Studies in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics, Iran; the Science Foundation, Ireland; the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Italy; the Korean Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology and the World Class University program of NRF, Korea; the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences; the Mexican Funding Agencies (CINVESTAV, CONACYT, SEP, and UASLP-FAI); the Ministry of Science and Innovation, New Zealand; the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission; theMinistry of Science and Higher Education and the National Science Centre, Poland; the Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Portugal; JINR (Armenia, Belarus, Georgia, Ukraine, Uzbekistan); the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, the Federal Agency of Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation, Russian Academy of Sciences, and the Russian Foundation for Basic Research; the Ministry of Science and Technological Development of Serbia; the Secretaría de Estado de Investigación, Desarrollo e Innovación and Programa Consolider-Ingenio 2010, Spain; the Swiss Funding Agencies (ETH Board, ETH Zurich, PSI, SNF, UniZH, Canton Zurich, and SER); the National Science Council, Taipei; the Thailand Center of Excellence in Physics, the Institute for the Promotion of Teaching Science and Technology and National Electronics and Computer Technology Center; the Scientific and Technical Research Council of Turkey, and Turkish Atomic Energy Authority; the Science and Technology Facilities Council, United Kingdom; the US Department of Energy, and the US National Science Foundation.

A search for a neutral Higgs boson decaying to a pair of b quarks, and produced in association with at least one additional b quark, is presented. Multijet final states with three jets identified as originating from b quarks, at least one of which may include a non-isolated muon, are studied. The data used in this analysis correspond to an integrated luminosity of 2. 7 – 4. 8 fb− 1, collected by the CMS experiment in proton–proton collisions at the LHC at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. This search is particularly sensitive to Higgs bosons in scenarios of the Minimal Supersymmetric Model (MSSM) with large values of tanβ. No excess over the predicted background from standard model processes is observed. Stringent upper limits on cross section times branching fraction are derived and interpreted as bounds in the MSSM tanβ and mA parameter-space. Observed 95 % confidence level upper limits reach as low as tanβ ≈ 18 for MA ≈ 100 GeV.

The results of a search for the bottomonium counterpart, denoted as Xb, of the exotic charmonium state X(3872) is presented. The analysis is based on a sample of pp collisions at s= 8 TeV collected by the CMS experiment at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 20. 7 fb- 1. The search looks for the exclusive decay channel Xb→Υ{hooked}(1 S) π+π- followed by Υ{hooked}(1 S) →μ+μ-. No evidence for an Xb signal is observed. Upper limits are set at the 95 % confidence level on the ratio of the inclusive production cross sections times the branching fractions to Υ{hooked}(1 S) π+π- of the Xb and the Υ{hooked}(2 S). The upper limits on the ratio are in the range 0. 9 - 5. 4 % for Xb masses between 10 and 11 GeV.

The events are collected in proton-proton collisions at √s= 7 TeV using the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 5. 3 fb- 1. The observed dimuon mass spectrum is consistent with that expected from the standard model. The data are interpreted {{in the context of a}} quark- and muon-compositeness model with a left-handed isoscalar current and an energy scale parameter Λ. The 95 % confidence level lower limit on Λ is 9. 5 TeV under the assumption of destructive interference between the standard model and contact-interaction amplitudes. For constructive interference, the limit is 13. 1 TeV. These limits are comparable to the most stringent ones reported to date. © 2013 CERN. Published by the American Physical Society.
