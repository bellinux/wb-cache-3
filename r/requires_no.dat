5|$|Geothermal power <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> fuel (except for pumps), and is {{therefore}} immune to fuel cost fluctuations. However, capital costs are significant. Drilling accounts for over half the costs, and exploration of deep resources entails significant risks. A typical well doublet (extraction and injection wells) in Nevada can support 4.5 megawatts (MW) and costs about $10million to drill, with a 20% failure rate.|$|E
5|$|In the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning (chapter 38), the enthroned {{figure of}} High {{explains}} that Odin gives {{all of the}} food on his table to his wolves Geri and Freki and that Odin <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> food, for wine is to him both meat and drink. High then quotes the above-mentioned stanza from the poem Grímnismál in support. In chapter 75 of the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál {{a list of names}} for wargs and wolves is provided that includes both Geri and Freki.|$|E

5|$|Kierkegaard {{argues that}} Hegel's {{philosophy}} dehumanized life by denying personal freedom and choice through the neutralization of the 'either/or'. The dialectic structure of becoming renders existence far too easy, in Hegel's theory, because conflicts are eventually mediated and disappear automatically through a natural process that <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> individual choice {{other than a}} submission {{to the will of}} the Idea or Geist. Kierkegaard saw this as a denial of true selfhood and instead advocated the importance of personal responsibility and choice-making.|$|E

5|$|HSP is a {{systemic}} vasculitis (inflammation of blood vessels) and {{is characterized by}} deposition of immune complexes containing the antibody immunoglobulin A (IgA); the exact cause for this phenomenon is unknown. In children it usually resolves within several weeks and <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> treatment apart from symptom control, but may relapse in a third of cases and cause irreversible kidney damage in about one in a hundred cases. In adults the prognosis is different than in children. The average duration of cutaneous lesions is 27.9 months. And for many {{it tends to be}} relapsing-remitting {{over a long period of}} time rather than self-limiting and there tend to be more complications.|$|E

5|$|As {{viewed by}} the Catholic Church, Baptism {{is the first of}} three sacraments of {{initiation}} as a Christian. It washes away all sins, both original sin and personal actual sins. It makes a person a member of the Church. As a gratuitous gift of God that <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> merit {{on the part of the}} person who is baptised, it is conferred even on children, who, though they have no personal sins, need it on account of original sin. If a new-born child is in a danger of death, anyone—be it a doctor, a nurse, or a parent—may baptise the child. Baptism marks a person permanently and cannot be repeated. The Catholic Church recognises as valid baptisms conferred even by people who are not Catholics or Christians, provided that they intend to baptise ("to do what the Church does when she baptises") and that they use the Trinitarian baptismal formula.|$|E
5|$|Structural {{alignment}} {{attempts to}} establish homology between {{two or more}} polymer structures based on their shape and three-dimensional conformation. This process is usually applied to protein tertiary structures but {{can also be used}} for large RNA molecules. In contrast to simple structural superposition, where at least some equivalent residues of the two structures are known, structural alignment <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> a priori knowledge of equivalent positions. Structural alignment is a valuable tool for the comparison of proteins with low sequence similarity, where evolutionary relationships between proteins cannot be easily detected by standard sequence alignment techniques. Structural alignment can therefore be used to imply evolutionary relationships between proteins that share very little common sequence. However, caution should be used in using the results as evidence for shared evolutionary ancestry because of the possible confounding effects of convergent evolution by which multiple unrelated amino acid sequences converge on a common tertiary structure.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the A5, joining the Sredanci {{interchange}} to Đakovo, was opened in 2007; the route to Osijek opened in 2009. As of September 2011, the section south of the A3, extending to the Sava River and border of Bosnia and Herzegovina, is under construction. Once the entire Pan-European corridor Vc is completed, motorists will recognize the A5's importance as a transit route. When completed, the corridor shall entail the A5 itself extended to the Hungarian border and connected to the Hungarian M6 motorway as well as Bosnia and Herzegovina's A1 motorway and the A10 motorway, completing the corridor route at the Adriatic Sea coast. The current route <b>requires</b> <b>no</b> major structures, but as of September 2011, two major bridges are under constructionacross Sava and Drava rivers as the motorway extends south and north respectively.|$|E
