40|$|In humans, the {{capacity}} for economically rational choice is constrained {{by a variety of}} preference biases: humans evaluate gambles relative to arbitrary <b>reference</b> points; <b>weigh</b> losses heavier than equally sized gains; and demand a higher price for owned goods than for equally preferred goods that are not yet owned. To date, however, fewer studies have examined the origins of these biases. Here, we review previous work demonstrating that human economic biases such as loss aversion and reference dependence are shared with an ancestrally related New World primate, the capuchin monkey (Cebus apella). We then examine whether capuchins display an endowment effect in a tokentrading task. We identified pairs of treats (fruit discs versus cereal chunks) that were equally preferred by each monkey. When given a chance to trade away their owned fruit discs to obtain the equally valued cereal chunks (or vice versa), however, monkeys required a far greater compensation than the equally preferred treat. We show that these effects are not due to transaction costs or timing issues. These data suggest that biased preferences rely on cognitive systems that are more evolutionarily ancient than previously thought—and that common evolutionary ancestry shared by humans and capuchins may account for the occurrence of the endowment effect in both species...|$|R

The FM identification and RT prediction modules are linked in a general framework that recognizes the patterns of dynamic evolution of the process variables in the different system failure modes. When a new failure scenario develops, its evolution pattern is compared by fuzzy similarity analysis to a library of reference multidimensional trajectory patterns of process variables evolution; the failure mode of the developing scenario is identified by combining the modes of failure of the <b>reference</b> patterns, <b>weighed</b> by their similarity to the developing pattern; the similarity weights are then fed to the RT prediction module that estimates the time remaining before the developing trajectory pattern hits a failure threshold. The approach is illustrated on failure scenarios of the Lead Bismuth Eutectic eXperimental Accelerator Driven System (LBE-XADS).

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{validate}} the 24 -hour recall as a tool for nutrition surveys in Algeria. The <b>reference</b> was the <b>weighing</b> method. The study took place in a rural district of North-Eastern Algeria. The subjects were 50 women of child-bearing age, chosen at random in the district population. The methods, recall and reference, were used to measure food intake over the same two days. We computed differences in paired observations (recall-reference) to detect a level-dependent bias, and a constant bias when the former was absent, and we assessed the precision of the method. We detected a level-dependent bias for lipid, vitamin A and iron intakes. High lipid intake was markedly underestimated with the recall. For vitamin A and iron, the bias was of small magnitude; it was symmetrical for iron but not for vitamin A. There was no constant bias for energy, protein and carbohydrate intakes. Moreover, for these nutrients, two thirds or more of recall estimates were within plus or minus 20 % of the reference. The small differential bias in vitamin A intake disappeared once omissions and additions of foods were removed. Bias in the 3 rd tertile of lipid intake was mainly due to an underestimation of portion size in fat-rich dishes, and to lesser extent to errors in the amount of fat in recipes. The 24 -hour recall is valid for measuring rural Algerian women's energy, protein and iron intakes but needs to be improved for estimating vitamin A and lipid intake. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
30|$|The DSC-TGA needs {{temperature}} correction for these systematic errors {{in order for}} results to be quantitative. This is traditionally accomplished via melting a series of standard materials of known melting point in the instrument then fitting a correction curve between the measured melting point and the reference data for the standard material. In addition, if each <b>reference</b> is carefully <b>weighed</b> with a microbalance, the latent heat effects of these melts can be integrated to provide calibration data for the calorimeter equation assuming the heat of fusion is well characterized for each reference material used to compute the {{temperature correction}}. This procedure introduces some new uncertainty since the melting point standards are sensitive to impurities changing the onset and completion of melting. To avoid the messiness of such melting temperature calibration uncertainties, many DSC-TGA manufacturers use magnetic reference materials of different Curie Temperatures to correct the temperature profile of the instrument. The sharp 2 nd-order nature of the Curie transformation means that it occurs almost instantaneously. There is no large magnitude heat effect during the Curie transformation in contrast with a 1 st order transformation like melting/solidification, but the TGA signal of a ferromagnetic material {{under the influence of}} an external magnetic field will manifest as a sharp drop (or increase if the magnet is placed such that it pulls the sample opposite to the direction of gravity) in effective mass exactly at the Curie Temperature. This response is stable so long as the reference is of reasonable purity, and is less messy than the onset of melting which can be subject to depression by things like contamination or sample size.|$|R
40|$|Background: Estimation of food portion sizes {{has always}} been a {{challenge}} in dietary studies on free-living individuals. The aim of this work was to develop and validate a food photography manual to improve the accuracy of the estimated size of consumed food portions. Methods: A manual was compiled from digital photos of foods commonly consumed by the Tunisian population. The food was cooked and weighed before taking digital photographs of three portion sizes. The manual was validated by comparing the method of 24 -hour recall (using photos) to the <b>reference</b> method [food <b>weighing</b> (FW) ]. In both the methods, the comparison focused on food intake amounts as well as nutritional issues. Validity was assessed by Bland–Altman limits of agreement. In total, 31 male and female volunteers aged 9 – 89 participated in the study. Results: We focused on eight food categories and compared their estimated amounts (using the 24 -hour recall method) to those actually consumed (using FW). Animal products and sweets were underestimated, whereas pasta, bread, vegetables, fruits, and dairy products were overestimated. However, {{the difference between the two}} methods is not statistically significant except for pasta (p< 0. 05) and dairy products (p< 0. 05). The coefficient of correlation between the two methods is highly significant, ranging from 0. 876 for pasta to 0. 989 for dairy products. Nutrient intake calculated for both methods showed insignificant differences except for fat (p< 0. 001) and dietary fiber (p< 0. 05). A highly significant correlation was observed between the two methods for all micronutrients. The test agreement highlights the lack of difference between the two methods. Conclusion: The difference between the 24 -hour recall method using digital photos and the weighing method is acceptable. Our findings indicate that the food photography manual can be a useful tool for quantifying food portion sizes in epidemiological dietary surveys...|$|R
40|$|Much {{research}} suggests that consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of value are frequently articulated relative to a reference level; options are valued as gains and losses relative to a reference point. Moreover, losses from this <b>reference</b> point are <b>weighed</b> more heavily than equivalent gains. This asymmetry has been termed loss aversion. This dissertation examines the effects of reference dependence and loss aversion on the processes and outcomes of choice among multiattribute options in multialternative choice sets. Based on past research, we propose that consumers often designate one brand in the choice set as a reference brand and then evaluate, in a loss averse manner, the attractiveness of competing brands as gains and losses from this reference brand. In a set of two experimental studies, we propose and test hypotheses regarding the effects of reference dependence on choice outcomes and processes. Specifically, we examine how loss aversion affects preferences within two and three alternative efficient choice sets. Moreover, we investigate a loss aversion based explanation for the attraction effect. In terms of the choice process, we examine how reference dependence and loss aversion affect information search, and whether these process-level changes mediate reference-dependent preferences. In line with previous evidence, we find that in efficient choice sets, reference status enhances a brand 2 ̆ 7 s attractiveness. A similar reference effect is obtained for the dominating option in asymmetrically dominated choice sets. Moreover, we find some support for our account of the attraction effect that hinges on aggregate reference brand relocations and loss aversion. Based on information acquisition patterns, {{we find that the}} perceptual phenomena of reference dependence and loss aversion have specific cognitive processing analogs. Compared to a control condition, more attention is paid to reference and loss information. Similarly, more comparisons are made involving reference and loss information. In addition, we find some evidence for a process-level mediation of reference-dependent preferences. We conclude that a reference dependence can change the processes and outcomes of consumer choice in systematic and predictable ways. The implications of such reference-dependent choice behavior for consumers and marketers are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1963 The free {{fatty acids}} of milk fat are {{believed}} to be involved in imparting flavor properties to milk and other dairy products. In the past the {{free fatty acids}} have largely been related to quality deterioration and hence the methods for measurement have been devised to determine the changes in the free fatty acid content and to relate these data with quality. No method has been reported to determine the quantities of individual free fatty acids. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate procedures and adapt methods for isolation and measurement of the free fatty acids of milk fat and then to evaluate adapted methods by quantitative measurement of the individual acids in fresh cream fat samples and in butter made therefrom. The ion exchange method of Hornstein et al. (50) was modified to isolate and esterify the free fatty acids from milk fat. The free fatty acids were adsorbed on Amberlite IRA- 400 resin, the resin was made fat free and the bound acids were simultaneously esterified and eluted with anhydrous methanol-HCl. The methyl esters were extracted from the reaction mixture with ethyl chloride (b. p. 12. 3 °C.). The ethyl chloride was evaporated and the esters weighed. The methyl esters were then separated by gas-liquid chromatography using the thermal conductivity detector. The recovery of each saturated even numbered fatty acid from 4 : 0 to 18 : 0 was checked. The percent recoveries obtained were: 4 : 0, 71. 4; 6 : 0, 86. 5; 8 : 0, 66. 6; 10 : 0, 75. 1; 12 : 0, 94. 3; 14 : 0, 100. 2; 16 : 0, 99. 5 and 18 : 0, 92. 5. The ion exchange resin was checked for its fat hydrolysing capacity, for retention of fatty acids when used in successive analyses and for leachings of brown polymers during each analysis. The resin did not show detectable hydrolysis of triglycerides nor did it retain or exchange fatty acids from previous use. It was necessary to pretreat the resin with stearic acid and anhydrous methanol-HCl to avoid interference of a leached polymer with quantitative results. An average of 5. 0 mg of residue leached from the resin during every analysis, but this did not interfere with the quantitative determination of free fatty acids. Twenty samples of milk fat; ten from pasteurized sweet cream, nine from cultured butter and one from sweet cream butter were analyzed for free fatty acids. The results obtained were compared with the esterified fatty acid content of milk fat. The percent composition of free fatty acids was {{similar to that of the}} esterified fatty acids in milk fat. Also the manufacturing process of butter had little or no effect upon the free fatty acid composition of the fat. The values obtained for volatile fatty acids, especially 4 : 0, were not consistent. One reason for this probably was that evaporation of the ethyl chloride from the solution of the methyl esters was carried out at room temperature and the evaporation rate was not controlled. It is believed that the results would be more consistent if the evaporation of ethyl chloride were carried out under controlled and standardized conditions and if internal standards are employed for quantitative <b>references</b> rather than <b>weighing</b> the ester mixture. Samples of autoxidized milk fat, sweet cream fat and rancid cream fat were analyzed for further evaluation of the method...|$|R
40|$|Phytoestrogens are plant {{compounds}} that possess estrogenic and biological properties {{that have been}} postulated to protect against chronic diseases. Isoflavonoids and lignans are two main classes of phytoestrogen that have been investigated for their estrogenic efficacy and occurrence in the human diet. Isoflavonoids are found in soy and related products, whereas lignans are found in {{a wider range of}} plant-based foods, such as cereals, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds; and in beverages such as tea, coffee and wine. In Western populations with low dietary intake of soy products, compared to the Asian counterparts, lignans could be a more important and consistent source of phytoestrogens from the diet. Data for the phytoestrogen content in foods are now available, as more recent research has been conducted to quantify content in commonly consumed food choices in Western populations. The collation of these published values has led to the desire to adequately assess lignan intake. The aims of the research were to evaluate the validity and reliability of a phytoestrogen food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) tool, with a <b>reference</b> method, the <b>weighed</b> food record (WFR), and urinary biomarkers, to measure phytoestrogen intake in the Australian context. The phytoestrogen FFQ was updated and refined to align with food groups and dietary patterns in the current Australian Dietary Guidelines, in particular to optimise measurement of lignans from the FFQ, and utilise current databases of lignan content available from direct measurement of lignans in foods. Intake level and contributing food sources of each class of phytoestrogen, and the associations between social and lifestyle characteristics and phytoestrogen intake and urinary biomarker were also explored. This was a cross-sectional study that recruited 59 Australian men and women aged 18 to 67 years at Joondalup campus, Edith Cowan University. Intake of lignans, isoflavonoids and enterolignans from foods was assessed using the 277 -item phytoestrogen FFQ and 3 -day WFR, and excretion was assessed with urinary biomarkers. Published values of phytoestrogen content in foods were utilised to measure the intakes. Subjects collected three 24 -hour urine samples and phytoestrogen concentration was analysed using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) technique for four lignan subclasses, five isoflavonoids and two enterolignans. Statistical analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS for Windows (SPSS Inc., Version 22 Chicago, IL). Median intake comparisons were assessed with the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Associations between the intake and excretion measurements of two dietary assessment methods were assessed using Spearman’s Rho correlations. Level of agreement between methods was assessed with cross-classification analysis and Bland Altman plots. A triangular comparison between the three methods was conducted with the Method of Triads (MOT) using the software R. The Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA were used to compare the median intakes and excretion across categories of social and lifestyle factors. The FFQ had acceptable convergent validity for intake of total lignans and enterolignans when compared to a WFR, in terms of median intakes (lignans: 3914 versus 4302 μg/day, p= 0. 09; enterolignans: 54 versus 65 μg/day, p= 0. 81, respectively); and associations between the two methods (lignans ρ= 0. 42, p Top contributing food sources of lignans were from the nuts and seeds group (30 %), nonalcoholic beverages (19 %), and breads and cereals (19 %); for enterolignans, from dairy products (86 %) followed by nonalcoholic beverages (11 %). Soy and related food products were the major contributors (78 %) to total isoflavones, followed by breads and cereal products (17 %). Female subjects who were Caucasian, were at, or had achieved university education level and took regular commercial dietary supplements, {{were more likely to have}} a higher lignan and enterolignan intake and excretion level than subjects with different characteristics. Based on these findings, we conclude that the modified phytoestrogen FFQ is highly reliable. It would be a useful assessment tool for example to rank usual intake of phytoestrogen classes for individuals within a group, or quantify mean intakes between different population groups. It is not acceptably valid or accurate for estimation of individual phytoestrogen status, for example for use in experimental studies or to investigate associations with chronic diseases. The lack of associations between measurement of the FFQ and biomarkers could partly be due to limitations of the FFQ tool, such as recall bias or inaccuracies in the estimation of frequency of intake or portion sizes. They also suggest that urinary biomarkers alone are not sufficient for estimation of phytoestrogen status and that additional biomarkers obtained from faecal and plasma samples should be considered for a more complete picture of phytoestrogen status...|$|R
40|$|Introdução: Uma ingestão alimentar insuficiente acarreta consequências clínicas, por outro lado também tem repercussões ao nível do Desperdício Alimentar (DA) gerado. Segundo a Resolution ResAP (2003) 3 on Food and Nutritional Care in Hospitals do Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, as unidades hospitalares devem realizar estudos anuais sobre o DA. Objetivo: Avaliar o DA sob a forma de restos, através de métodos diretos (pesagem, método de referência) e indiretos (observacional e registos de enfermagem), de um Serviço de Alimentação (SA) e seus determinantes numa Unidade Hospitalar. Metodologia: Estudo de investigação de caráter analítico, observacional e {{transversal}} realizado entre março e maio de 2015. Avaliou-se o DA em forma de restos, ou seja, alimentos distribuídos e não consumidos, das refeições servidas ao almoço, durante o dia da colheita de dados, de 83 doentes internados na Unidade Hospitalar de Bragança. O DA foi avaliado através dos métodos de pesagem, observacional e registos de enfermagem. A cada utente foi aplicado um Inquérito de Satisfação Alimentar. Resultados: A média da totalidade de DA encontrada na refeição do almoço foi de 31, 2 %. Apesar de não existir diferença significativa entre as médias dos três métodos, verificou-se existir uma forte correlação e uma concordância mais elevada entre o método de pesagem e observacional, do que os registos de enfermagem na determinação do DA. Além disso, o registo de enfermagem superestima o DA, em relação ao método de pesagem. A sopa e a sobremesa foram os componentes da refeição mais desperdiçados, verificando-se que o método observacional subestima o DA destes dois componentes. A dieta mole foi a que teve maior percentagem de DA pelo método direto. Constatou-se que os doentes que necessitavam de ajuda na toma das refeições e os que não estavam com o seu apetite normal foram os que mais desperdiçaram. Apurou-se que 73, 5 % dos doentes se encontravam muito satisfeitos com a qualidade do serviço prestado pelo SA, tendo também sido estes os que menos desperdiçaram. Conclusão: Os métodos indiretos utilizados na determinação do DA podem ser válidos em relação ao método de referência que é a pesagem na determinação do DA. É essencial que se continuem a tomar medidas para a diminuição do DA nas unidades hospitalares. Desta forma, devem-se tornar as refeições mais apelativas e saborosas com uma textura adequada; auxiliar o doente no momento da toma das refeições; disponibilizar várias opções de alimentos e a possibilidade de escolha aos utentes e ter em consideração os hábitos e preferências alimentares de cada doente. Introduction: Inadequate {{food intake}} leads to clinical consequences, {{on the other}} hand also has repercussions in terms of food waste generated. According to Resolution ResAP (2003) 3 on Food and Nutritional Care in Hospitals of the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers, the hospitals should conduct annual studies on food waste Objective: To evaluate the food waste in the form of leftovers, by direct methods (<b>weighing,</b> <b>reference</b> method) and indirect (observational and nursing records), of a food service and its determinants in a hospital unit. Methodology: The research study is analytical, observational and transversal, conducted between March and May 2015. We evaluated the food waste in the form of leftovers, ie food distributed and not consumed, meals served for lunch during the day of data collection of 83 patients admitted in the Hospital Unit of Bragança. The food waste was evaluated through weighing methods, observational and nursing record. To each wearer was applied an inquiry of food satisfaction. Results: The average of all Food Waste found in the lunch meal was 31. 2 %. Although there is {{no significant difference between the}} averages of the three methods, there was a strong correlation and a higher correlation between the weighing and observational methods than nursing records in determining the food waste. Furthermore, the nursing record overestimates food waste in relation to the weighing method. The soup and dessert were the components of the meal more wasted, verifying that the observational method underestimates the food waste of these two components. A soft diet was the one with the highest percentage of waste food by the direct method. It was found that patients who needed help in the ingestion of food and those who did not feel normal appetite were the ones who wasted the most. It was found that 73. 5 % of the patients were very satisfied with the quality of the service provided by the food service and these were the ones who wasted less. Conclusion: Indirect methods used to determine the food waste can be set in relation to the reference method, which is the weighing in the determination of the food waste. It is essential to continue to take measures to reduce food waste in hospitals. Thus, meals should be made more appealing and tasty and with a suitable texture; assist the patient at the time of taking meals; offer a choice of food and the possibility for wearer to choose and take into account the habits and food preferences of each patient...|$|R
40|$|The South, {{composed}} of whatever {{regions in the}} United States happen to fall below an arbitrary marking known as the Mason and Dixon line, has a widespread reputation for provinciality. Clinging in legend and actuality to the remembered glories of a departed order, {{it has come to}} be accepted as the region wherein new trends penetrate most slowly, encountered as they are by a resistance embracing the entire region. Balanced as it is against the portentous growth of Southern culture in the twentieth century, the popular conception of Southern provinciality offers interesting possibilities when applied to the development in the social and literary stature of the Negro character. It is, then, the possible contradiction in attitudes toward the Negro offered by two prevailing trends in the Southland, which motivates the present thesis, which is in reality a portion of a larger research study, to be carried on during ensuing years at Atlanta University, on the treatment of the Negro in the fictional literature of the entire South, for the purpose of determining whether the South 2 ̆ 7 s comparatively new intellectualism has produced any change in the attitudes and characterization accorded the Negro. This is not the first study of the treatment of the Negro in American fiction. It has been preceded by such studies as Willie Lou Talbot 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 The Development of the Negro character in the Southern Novel, 1924 - 19002 ̆ 2; 1 John Herbert Nelson 2 ̆ 7 s The Negro Character in American Literature; Sterling Brown 2 ̆ 7 s The Negro in American Fiction; Nick Aaron Ford 2 ̆ 7 s The Contemporary Negro Novel: A Study in Race Relations; a goodly portion of Francis Pendleton Gaines 2 ̆ 7 The Southern Plantation; as well as numerous magazine articles, the most valuable to this study being, Tremaine McDowell 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 The Negro Character in the Southern Novel Prior to 18502 ̆ 2; and H. P. Marley 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 The Negro in Recent Southern Fiction. 2 ̆ 2 None of these studies, however, has selected quite the province of the present thesis, which has limited itself to a rather short period of time and a comparatively small area. The period of the last twenty years was chosen, first, because it reveals the most rapid cultural advancement for the South, and second, because it is generally conceded by writers on the subject that this period has brought forth a new delineation of the Negro throughout the United States. The state was selected as a division of the total study of the Negro in Southern fiction, because of possibly distinct offerings in the cultural background of each. This limited range of material permits an intensity of treatment hardly possible in studies of wider scope. aThe treatment herein presented includes an analysis of thirty representative Louisiana novels, {{selected on the basis of}} as wide a scope of picturization of the state as the writer could procure. The chief basis for selection of works was the identification of the author, first by birth, and then by residence with the state of Louisiana. Works by Negro authors were excluded, because it was assumed that Negro authors would necessarily treat Negro characters with a certain amount of liberality. The cross-section of literature, thus chosen, reveals something of the variety of racial strains present in the Louisiana population: the Caucasian, the Creole, the Acadian, the Mulatto, and the full-blooded Negro. It also gives a running survey of the history of the economic, sociological, and political development of the state from before the Civil War to the present. The novels included in this study divide themselves naturally into two classes: those prolonging the traditional conception of the Negro, and those applying critical realism to the entire region, including the Negro and his specific problems, in a unified sweep of investigation accorded the whole South. 09 It is this natural division which, with the addition of a chapter on backgrounds, has determined the plan of the thesis, which will be divided thus into three chapters: (1) 2 ̆ 2 The Cultural Heritages of the Louisiana Author, 2 ̆ 2 which will attempt to clarify possible approaches of the Louisiana author to the material he attacks, and which will place emphasis upon the growth and development of Southern literature within the province of the widely accepted aristocratic tradition. (2) 2 ̆ 2 The Negro in the Novels Prolonging the Traditional Racial Picture, 2 ̆ 2 which will attempt to present the Negro as he is portrayed in those novels which, written between 1920 and 1940, adhere to the stock attitudes promulgated by the aristocratic tradition. (3) 2 ̆ 2 The Negro in the Novels Criticising and Limiting the Traditional Racial Picture, 2 ̆ 2 which will attempt to define the attitudes toward the race, and to describe the characterization of the Negro in the novels applying the recent intellectual critical realism to the Southern regions. It has been the immediate purpose of the investigator to <b>weigh</b> <b>reference</b> and characterization in the selected novels from the time of the sovereignty of the aristocratic tradition to the present period of critical realism, in order to determine first, in what measure the treatment is typical of latter-day attitudes, and secondly, whether or not there is recognition on the part of the composite group of writers of the increasing degree to which the Negro has integrated himself into the cultural and intellectual advancement of the nation. The measure of the last premise will determine the degree in which the treatment of the Negro will be considered liberal.
