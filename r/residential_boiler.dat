This work aims at characterising the particle emission from residential combustion of oat grain and its potential reduction by addition of limestone or kaolin with the fuel. Then, to a large extent, the potassium supplied by the fuel is expected to be found in coarse particles, leaving the boiler as bottom ash, instead of being emitted to the air in the form of submicron particles. Combustion experiments were performed on a <b>residential</b> <b>boiler,</b> using filter sampling and low-pressure impactors to measure the mass and number concentrations and size distributions of the emitted particles. The particles and the bottom ash were subsequently analysed for inorganic material. To check the combustion conditions and basic emissions from combustion of cereals, the flue gas was analysed with respect to gaseous O 2, CO 2, CO, NOx, TOC (total organic carbon), HCl and SO 2. Furthermore, thermodynamic equilibrium analysis was used to support the experimental data. Finally, it is concluded that the particle emission can be lowered by supplying kaolin, while there was no effect of limestone. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserve...|$|E

In the core of our TEGs is a thermoelectric module of unique device-packaging architecture that enables device operation at 500 oC temperature differences with 10 % heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency. By developing a multi-physics model, we were able to creative innovative heat exchanger subsystem and thermal management design for high conversion efficiency power generation. Goals of the system were to maximize thermal efficiency and electric power output while minimizing pressure drop and thermal stress across the system. The TEG was installed on the heat exchanger interior of a 30 KW <b>residential</b> <b>boiler</b> in order to utilize the temperature differences between the water and combustion flame. We were able to convert a portion of the heat into electricity with the remaining heat contributing to water heating. Our initial thermoelectric generator prototype shows the electric power output of about 100 W. The CHP boiler will not only provide on-site energy generating capabilities at about 50 % less cost than electricity from the grid, but also provide thermal and electrical energy at times when other alternative energy sources are not available. This technology significantly increases the value of fuel and enhances the overall facility security by providing a back-up power during inclement weather and natural/artificial disasters.

The focus of this work to date has been on sufficient electric power output to achieve self-powering of the appliance with the consideration that reliability of the heating system during power outages may provide the greatest value to the consumer. Also explored {{is the potential for}} producing larger power output levels, to 1 kW. Low cost, currently available TE devices, based on bismuth telluride, have very low thermal to electric power conversion efficiencies. The use of these in self-powered heating appliances for other applications is established art. Further for simply self-powering, a low conversion efficiency is all that is required to produce the 100 watts needed to power the system. Advanced TE materials under development offer strong potential for increased efficiency in the future. TPV, while currently at an earlier state of development offers the potential for higher conversion efficiencies.

40|$|Catalyzed {{combustion}} {{offers the}} advantages of increased fuel efficiency, decreased emissions (both NOx and CO), and an expanded operating range. These performance improvements {{are related to the}} ability of the catalyst to stabilize a flame at or within the burner media and to combust fuel at much lower temperatures. This technology has a diverse set of applications in industrial and commercial heating, including boilers for the paper, food and chemical industries. However, wide spread adoption of catalyzed combustion has been limited by the high cost of precious metals needed for the catalyst materials. The primary objective of this project was the development of an innovative catalyzed burner media for commercial and small industrial boiler applications that drastically reduce the unit cost of the catalyzed media without sacrificing the benefits associated with catalyzed combustion. The scope of this program was to identify both the optimum substrate material as well as the best performing catalyst construction to meet or exceed industry standards for durability, cost, energy efficiency, and emissions. It was anticipated that commercial implementation of this technology would result in significant energy savings and reduced emissions. Based on demonstrated achievements, there is a potential to reduce NOx emissions by 40, 000 TPY and natural gas consumption by 8. 9 TBtu in industries that heavily utilize natural gas for process heating. These industries include food manufacturing, polymer processing, and pulp and paper manufacturing. Initial evaluation of commercial solutions and upcoming EPA regulations suggests that small to midsized boilers in industrial and commercial markets could possibly see the greatest benefit from this technology. While out of scope for the current program, an extension of this technology could also be applied to catalytic oxidation for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Considerable progress has been made {{over the course of the}} grant period in accomplishing these objectives. Our work in the area of Pd-based, methane oxidation catalysts has led to the development of highly active catalysts with relatively low loadings of Pd metal using proprietary coating methods. The thermal stability of these Pd-based catalysts were characterized using SEM and BET analyses, further demonstrating that certain catalyst supports offer enhanced stability toward both PdO decomposition and/or thermal sintering/growth of Pd particles. When applied to commercially available fiber mesh substrates (both metallic and ceramic) and tested in an open-air burner, these catalyst-support chemistries showed modest improvements in the NOx emissions and radiant output compared to uncatalyzed substrates. More significant, though, was the performance of the catalyst-support chemistries on novel media substrates. These substrates were developed to overcome the limitations that are present with commercially available substrate designs and increase the gas-catalyst contact time. When catalyzed, these substrates demonstrated a 65 - 75 % reduction in NOx emissions across the firing range when tested in an open air burner. In testing in a <b>residential</b> <b>boiler,</b> this translated into NOx emissions of < 15 ppm over the 15 - 150 kBtu/hr firing range...|$|E
40|$|Executive Summary: This project {{investigated}} the combustion performance of blends of unrefined Jatropha oil and its blends in laboratory boilers. Although {{a very limited}} amount of testing blends in distillate oil, ASTM No. 2 oil or heating oil was conducted, the primary interest was in testing the performance of blends with residual ASTM No. 6 oil. The basic idea {{is to provide a}} renewable fuel option to residual oil used in space heating and in industrial applications. The intent also was to explore the use of non-edible plant oil and one that might be potentially cheaper than biodiesel. The characteristics of No. 6 oil, such as high viscosity at ambient temperature, which requires it to be kept heated, make the blending with such oils feasible. Jatropha oil is one such oil and there is currently considerable interest building up in its use as a source for making biodiesel and jet fuel. A 10 % blend of Jatropha oil with heating oil was burned using a standard burner in a <b>residential</b> <b>boiler.</b> Combustion performance was shown to be comparable with that of burning heating oil by itself with some noticeable differences. Typical heating oil has about 2000 ppm of sulfur, while the Jatropha oil has about 50 ppm leading to lower levels of sulphur dioxide emissions. Stack measurements also showed that the NOx emission was lower with the blend. We have previously reported similar reductions in NOx with blends of biodiesel in heating oil as well as slight reductions in PM 2. 5, particulates below 2. 5 microns in size. Long term tests were not part of this project and hence deleterious effects on pumps, seals etc., if any, were not measured. The majority of the work involved testing blends of Jatropha oil with residual oil in a 1. 5 million Btu/hr boiler with a burner modified to burn residual oil. Blends of 20 and 60 % Jatropha oil and 100 % Jatropha oil were burned in the combustion performance tests. The residual oil used had a sulfur content of over 2000 ppm and hence dramatic reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions are measured with the blends. Again, consistent with our past experience with biodiesel blends, significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions nearing 50 % with 100 % Jatropha oil, were also measured. This is in contrast with the use of biodiesel in diesel engines, where the NOx has a tendency to increase. In addition to the gaseous emission measurements, particulate emissions were measured using an EPA CTM- 39 system to obtain both particulates, of sizes below 2. 5 microns, so-called PM 2. 5, and of sizes larger than 2. 5 microns. The results show that the particulate emissions are lower with the blending of Jatropha oil. Overall, one can conclude that the blending of Jatropha oil with residual oil is a feasible approach to using non-edible plant oil to provide a renewable content to residual oil, with significant benefits in the reduction of pollutant emissions such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and particulates...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{significant}} amount of oil, about 12. 6 million barrels per year, used for power generation in New York State. The majority of it is residual oil. The primary reason for using residual oil probably is economic, as these fuels are cheaper than distillates. However, the stack emissions from the use of such fuels, especially in densely populated urban areas, can be a cause for concern. The emissions of concern include sulfur and nitrogen oxides and particulates, particularly PM 2. 5. Blending with distillate (ASTM No. 2) fuels may not reduce some or all of these emissions. Hence, a case can be made for blending with biofuels, such as biodiesel, as they tend to have very little fuel bound sulfur and nitrogen and have been shown in prior work at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) to reduce NOx emissions as well in small boilers. Some of the research carried out at CANMET in Canada has shown potential reductions in PM with blending of biodiesel in distillate oil. There is also the benefit obtaining from the renewable nature of biofuels in reducing the net carbon dioxide emitted thus contributing to the reduction of green house gases that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere. The present project was conceived to examine the potential for such benefits of blending biofuels with residual oil. A collaboration was developed with personnel at the New York City Poletti Power Plant of the New York Power Authority. Their interest arose from an 800 MW power plant that was using residual oil and which was mandated to be shut down in 2010 because of environmental concerns. A blend of 20 % biodiesel in residual oil had also been tested {{for a short period of}} about two days in that boiler a couple of years back. In this project, emission measurements including particulate measurements of PM 2. 5 were made in the commercial boiler test facility at BNL described below. Baseline tests were done using biodiesel as the blending biofuel. Biodiesel is currently and probably in the foreseeable future more expensive than residual fuel. So, another task was to explore potential alternative biofuels that might confer emission benefits similar to those of biodiesel, while being potentially significantly cheaper. Of course, for power plant use, availability in the required quantities is also {{a significant}} criterion. A subsidiary study to determine the effect of the temperature of the filter used to collect and measure the PM 2. 5 emissions was conducted.

Net residue yield varies around 1 oven dry tonne per hectare, with minor differences between grape varietals and harvesting technologies.

The average GEM, RGM and PBM concentrations were found to be 3. 22 ± 1. 74 ng m − 3, 10. 1 ± 18. 8 pg m − 3 and 98. 2 ± 112. 7 pg m − 3, respectively, about 2 – 20 times of the background concentration of Northern Hemisphere. The results indicated that atmospheric mercury concentrations in North China were highly affected by anthropogenic emissions. The atmospheric mercury showed obvious seasonal variations with the highest seasonal average GEM concentration in summer (3. 48 ng m − 3) and the lowest value in winter (2. 66 ng m − 3). In autumn and winter a diurnal variation of GEM was observed with peak levels in late afternoon till midnight. Most of the high RGM concentration values occurred in the afternoon of all seasons due to the higher oxidation. The PBM concentration was higher in early morning of all seasons because of the atmospheric stratification during nighttime against laminar fluxes during daytime. The ratio of GEM to CO indicates that <b>residential</b> <b>boilers</b> play an important role in the elevation of GEM in winter. The ratio of RGM to O 3 could be an indicator of the contribution of local primary sources. The ratio of PBM to PM 2. 5 reveals that the air mass from east and southwest to the site in spring and summer carries more atmospheric mercury. The HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis indicated that the monitoring site is affected by local, regional and interregional sources simultaneously during heavy pollution episodes. The results from the potential source contribution function (PSCF) model indicate that the atmospheric transport predominantly from the northwest contribute to the elevated atmospheric mercury in winter and autumn, while the North China Plain (NCP) Region and the north part of Yangtze River Delta (YRD) Region are the major source areas for mercury pollution in spring and summer...|$|R
40|$|Residential {{household}} {{space heating}} energy use comprises {{close to half}} of all residential energy consumption. Currently, average space heating use by household is 43. 9 Mbtu for a year. An average, however, does not reflect regional variation in heating practices, energy costs, or fuel type. Indeed, a national average does not capture regional or consumer group cost impacts from changing efficiency levels of heating equipment. The US Department of Energy sets energy standards for residential appliances in, what is called, a rulemaking process. The <b>residential</b> furnace and <b>boiler</b> efficiency rulemaking process investigates {{the costs and benefits}} of possible updates to the current minimum efficiency regulations. Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) selected the sample used in the <b>residential</b> furnace and <b>boiler</b> efficiency rulemaking from publically available data representing United States residences. The sample represents 107 million households in the country. The data sample provides the household energy consumption and energy price inputs to the life-cycle cost analysis segment of the furnace and boiler rulemaking. This paper describes the choice of criteria to select the sample of houses used in the rulemaking process. The process of data extraction is detailed in the appendices and is easily duplicated. The life-cycle cost is calculated in two ways with a household marginal energy price and a national average energy price. The LCC results show that using an national average energy price produces higher LCC savings but does not reflect regional differences in energy price...|$|R
40|$|Air quality {{issues related}} to the {{presence}} and emission levels of particulate matter have been recently addressed towards ultrafine and nanoparticles size fractions, with typical dimensions included in the range from 0, 1 µm down to few nm. Particular {{attention has been paid to}} their emissions from combustion activities, although the large majority of investigations in this field are dedicated to traffic sources, with rather limited studies for stationary energy production systems. Following a general review of available data on ultrafine particle emissions from various stationary combustion systems and different fuels, present work describes a dedicated particulate matter stack sampling line which combines a dilution system and an electrical low pressure impactor for evaluating number concentrations and size distributions of the condensible fraction arising from dilution and cooling of flue gases with atmospheric air. Preliminary results obtained with the system for <b>residential</b> heating <b>boilers</b> fed with different fuels (wood pellets, fuel oil, natural gas) are reported and analyzed in terms of their dependence with fuel type, boiler operating regime and sampling conditions (dilution ratios, hot and cold sampling). 1...|$|R
40|$|Gaseous and {{particulate}} emissions from a <b>residential</b> pellet <b>boiler</b> and a stove are measured at a realistic 6 -day operation sequence and during steady state operation. The {{aim is to}} characterize the emissions during each phase {{in order to identify}} when the major part of the emissions occur to enable actions for emission reduction where the savings can be highest. The characterized emissions comprised carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO), total organic carbon (TOC) and particulate matter (PM 2. 5). In this study, emissions were characterised by mass concentration and emissions during start-up and stop phases were also presented in accumulated mass. The influence of start-up and stop phases on the emissions, average emission factors for the boiler and stove were analysed using the measured data from a six-days test. The share of start-up and stop emissions are significant for CO and TOC contributing 95 % and 89 % respectively at the 20 kW boiler and 82 % and 89 % respectively at the 12 kW stove. NO and particles emissions are shown to dominate during stationary operation...|$|R
2500|$|With often minimal modification, most <b>residential</b> {{furnaces}} and <b>boilers</b> {{that are}} designed to burn No. 2 heating oil can be made to burn either biodiesel or filtered, preheated waste vegetable oil (WVO). [...] If cleaned at home by the consumer, WVO can result in considerable savings. [...] Many restaurants will receive a minimal amount for their used cooking oil, and processing to biodiesel is fairly simple and inexpensive. [...] Burning filtered WVO directly is somewhat more problematic, since it is much more viscous; nonetheless, its burning can be accomplished with suitable preheating. [...] WVO can thus be an economical heating option for those with the necessary mechanical and experimental aptitude.|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} {{of current and}} future emissions, air concentrations and atmospheric deposition of mercury world-wide are presented {{on the basis of}} results obtained during the performance of the EU GMOS (Global Mercury Observation System) project. Emission estimates for mercury were prepared with the main goal of applying them in models to assess current (2013) and future (2035) air concentrations and atmospheric deposition of this contaminant. The artisanal and small- scale gold mining, as well as combustion of fossil fuels (mainly coal) for energy and heat production in power plants and in industrial and <b>residential</b> <b>boilers</b> are the major anthropogenic sources of Hg emissions to the atmosphere at present. These sources account for about 37 % and 25 % of the total anthropogenic Hg emissions globally, estimated to be about 2000 tonnes. The emissions in Asian countries, particularly in China and India dominate the total emissions of Hg. The current estimate of mercury emissions from natural processes (primary mercury emissions and re-emissions), including mercury depletion events, were estimated to be 5207 tonnes per year which represent nearly 70 % of the global mercury emission budget. Oceans are the most important sources (36 %) followed by biomass burning (9 %). A comparison of the 2035 anthropogenic emissions estimated for 3 different scenarios with current anthriopogenic emissions indicates a reduction of these emissions in 2035 up to 85 % for the best case scenario. Two global chemical transport models (GLEMOS and ECHMERIT) have been used for the evaluation of future Hg pollution levels considering future emission scenarios. Projections of future changes in Hg deposition on a global scale simulated by these models for three anthropogenic emissions scenarios of 2035 indicate a decrease of up to 50 % deposition in the Northern Hemisphere and up to 35 % in Southern Hemisphere for the best case scenario. The EU GMOS project {{has proved to be a}} very important research instrument for supporting, first the scientific justification for the Minamata Convention, and then monitoring of the implementation of targets of this Convention, as well as, the EU Mercury Strategy. This project provided the state-of-the art with regard to the development of the latest emission inventories for mercury, future emission scenarios, dispersion modelling of atmospheric Hg on global and regional scale, and source – receptor techniques for Hg emission apportionment on a global scale...|$|R
