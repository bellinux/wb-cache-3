5|$|The first upper molar (M1) was {{described}} as square by De Bruijn and as rounded by Prieto and Böhme. There are five main transverse crests, which are mostly isolated, but some may be connected on {{the borders of the}} teeth. The middle crest, the centroloph, <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> the labial (outer) margin in the single known M1 of S.bolligeri, but does not in any of the five M1 of S.alpinus. The front crest, the anteroloph, is less distinct in S.bolligeri than most S.alpinus, but one M1 of S.alpinus {{is similar to that of}} S.bolligeri. M1 has three roots in S.alpinus, but the number of roots in S.bolligeri is not known.|$|E
5|$|The {{song thrush}} breeds {{in most of}} Europe (although not in {{the greater part of}} Iberia, lowland Italy or {{southern}} Greece), and across the Ukraine and Russia almost to Lake Baikal. It <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> 75°N in Norway, but only to about 60°N in Siberia. Birds from Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and Russia winter around the Mediterranean, North Africa and the Middle East, but only some of the birds in the milder west of the breeding range leave their breeding areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{technology}} of oil transportation has evolved alongside the oil industry. Although human {{use of oil}} <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> prehistory, the first modern commercial exploitation dates back to James Young's manufacture of paraffin in 1850. In the early 1850s, oil began to be exported from Upper Burma, then a British colony. The oil was moved in earthenware vessels to the river bank where it was then poured into boat holds for transportation to Britain.|$|E
5|$|A {{medium-sized}} gray bat, Myotis escalerai {{is similar}} to Myotis nattereri. The fur is long and soft; with a brown tone on the back, and the brighter underparts approaching white. The feet are dark gray. Much of the face is pink, and the muzzle is pointed, with long hairs on the upper lip resembling a moustache. The long ears are brown to gray. The tragus, a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear, is long and <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> the middle of the ear and colored gray to yellow, becoming darker from the base towards the tip. According to several authors, it differs from M.nattereri in showing a distinct fringe of hairs on the tail membrane, but bat specialist A.M. Hutson writes that this feature does not distinguish the two species. In addition, the presence of an S-shaped spur on the uropatagium (membrane between the hind legs), which approaches the middle of the membrane, is a distinctive feature of this species. With its broad wings, low flight, and rapid wingbeats, the species is capable of precise, agile flight.|$|E
5|$|Built as the Mont Dore Hotel in 1881, Bournemouth Town Hall was {{designated}} a Grade II listed building in 2001. Designed by Alfred Bedborough in the French, Italian and neo-classical styles, the foundation stone was laid by King Oscar II of Sweden and Norway {{and the hotel}} opened in 1885. The buff brick exterior features Bath stone dressings and terracotta friezes. The main entrance is sited within a projected façade that <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> the eaves and is topped with a pediment, while above sits a belvedere with turrets and a pavilion roof. During the First World War the hotel {{was used as a}} hospital for British and Indian soldiers and after as a convalescent home. It never opened as a hotel again and was purchased by Bournemouth Borough Council in 1919.|$|E

5|$|On the mandible, the {{diastema}} is {{very large}} and the incisor is procumbent (projecting forward), which distinguishes Apeomyoides from most eomyids apart from Megapeomys. There is a masseteric scar (associated with the jaw muscles) from below the m1 forward to a point in front of p4, below the mental foramen, {{an opening in the}} jawbone. In Apeomys and Megapeomys this scar only <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> the level of the front root of p4. The mental foramen is very small and opens in the diastema, near the ventral shelf of the scar; in Apeomys and Megapeomys it is located near the dorsal shelf. Further foramina are present on the lingual (inner) surface of the bone, below the cheekteeth.|$|E
5|$|Rushing {{through the}} University, Jack {{narrowly}} rescues Will from the falling debris. Will warns Jack he cannot simply repair the fracture then and there, {{as it would}} erase key future events and risk a time paradox. Passing a frozen Beth during a stutter, Jack <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> unfreeze her, but hesitates and leaves. Reaching the Bradbury Pool, Jack and Will travel forward in time, only to find Paul and Monarch waiting for them. Paul is intent on either retrieving the CFR or destroying it. Jack fights and kills him. Hooking the CFR into his time machine, Will asks Jack to jumpstart it with chronon energy. The CFR activates and blasts the area with chronons, fixing the tear and vaporizing Paul. As Will examines the CFR, burnt out from the blast, Jack has a vision of his future self traveling {{to the end of}} time, and begins exhibiting symptoms of chronon syndrome.|$|E

The first two sections act as a parallel route for part of the original valley way, but use riverside footpaths instead.|$|E

25|$|The {{remains of}} a gravity {{railroad}} owned by the Delaware and Hudson Railway can be seen along the lower reaches of Aylesworth Creek, as can the remains of some old mills. The United States Army Corps of Engineers constructed a flood protection project on Aylesworth Creek in the 1970s. In 2000, a stream stabilization project {{was carried out in}} the creek's lower <b>reaches</b> <b>to</b> reduce bank erosion. An abandoned mine drainage mitigation project is located in the watershed of Aylesworth Creek. It consists of two limestone water wheels the revolve in two concrete basins and neutralize the flow of acid mine drainage into Aylesworth Creek Lake. The project became operational in March 1983 and its construction cost was $344,519.10. However, the system eventually entered a state of disrepair and in 2006 it was replaced by an anoxic limestone drain for $191,000.|$|E
