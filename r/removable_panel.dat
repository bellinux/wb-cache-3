5000|$|During the Middle Ages, men {{who were}} {{guarding}} the tower were housed there. Duras provided weapons and maybe some horses. But Gageac had to organize its own food; {{this is the reason}} why we find in old books [...] "the robbers of Gageac just skimming the outskirts of the Madeleine." [...] Gageac was later expanded. Another building separate from the dungeon was built to house the troops. It was possible to move from one building to another {{with the help of a}} <b>removable</b> <b>panel</b> on the first floor.|$|E
50|$|In {{recent years}} NTE5 sockets {{have been fitted}} in place of master sockets. These have a front plate where the lower half is {{removable}} so allowing customer's access to the terminals required for connecting internal extension sockets; it also provides access to a test jack, to determine if line faults are due to the customer's wiring or BT's. The <b>removable</b> <b>panel</b> also allows the external telephone line to be easily disconnected from the internal wiring, provided the wiring of the premises has been correctly carried out. The terminals on the back part used to be large screw terminals; however, all BT NTE5 sockets now use insulation-displacement connectors (IDCs).|$|E
50|$|Bösendorfer {{built the}} first Imperial in 1900, {{following}} a suggestion by composer Ferruccio Busoni to build a model with an extended range. Busoni sought to extend the range to accommodate his transcription of the Chaconne from Johann Sebastian Bach's Partita in D minor for solo violin. The Bösendorfer Imperial features 97 keys: a full eight octaves. This {{is in contrast to}} their other extended model, the Bösendorfer 225, which has 92 keys (down to F0). The extra keys, which are all at the bass end of the keyboard (that is, to the left), are colored black so that the pianist can tell them apart from the normal keys of an 88-key piano. They were originally covered with a <b>removable</b> <b>panel</b> to prevent a pianist from accidentally playing the extra notes. While the keys are seldom used, the extra bass strings create additional harmonic resonance that contributes to an overall richer sound. Compositions have been written specifically to utilize the extra keys.|$|E
5000|$|A {{convertible}} or cabriolet ( [...] ; [...] ) is {{an automobile}} body style that can convert between an open-air mode and an enclosed one, varying in degree and means by model. Convertibles {{evolved from the}} earlier phaeton, an open vehicle without glass side windows that sometimes had <b>removable</b> <b>panels</b> of fabric or other material for protection from the elements.|$|R
40|$|Proposed {{quick-disconnect}} fastener {{for two or}} more parts resists shear {{loads and}} torque. Device centers parts to be joined, clamps and tightens them into single unit. Potential applications for removable fastener include holding parts for welding, brazing, soldering, riveting, and gluing. Other possible uses are for attaching <b>removable</b> <b>panels</b> and panels with poor access {{on one side and}} plugging leaks in pressure vessels...|$|R
50|$|The Palace has a Baroque façade {{from which}} the Honour Court, where the {{military}} ceremonies are held, and the Honour Staircase can be accessed. The Central Hall has a frescoed ceiling with the 17th-century Incoronation of Bradamante by Marco Antonio Franceschini. The Salottino d'Oro ("Golden Hall"), covered with gilted <b>removable</b> <b>panels,</b> was used by Duke Francis III as his main cabinet of work.|$|R
5000|$|A {{range of}} Dodge and International Harvester {{gasoline}} engines were available, as were diesels from Perkins (for lighter variants), Cummins, Caterpillar, and Detroit Diesel for the heaviest duty versions, both six-cylinder and V8 versions. Gasoline-powered versions were simply called the [...] "C"-series, {{followed by a}} numeral indicating weight class, {{and all of them}} were V8-powered. Perkins diesel-engined units were called [...] "PC", while inline diesels were called [...] "CN" [...] and V-type diesels were [...] "CV". A [...] "T" [...] following the letters indicates a tandem rear axle. On LCFs equipped with inline-six diesels the engine intruded into the cabin. This was covered with a <b>removable</b> <b>panel</b> for maintenance. A near unlimited range of engines, transmissions, and rear axles were available for what was usually a built-to-order truck. The biggest diesel available was the Cummins V-903, a giant [...] unit with a modest [...] max output. The smaller [...] Detroit Diesel 8V-71N was the most powerful engine, with [...] on tap.|$|E
5000|$|The {{building}} {{now known}} as the Maine Maid Inn was built in 1789 as the home for the prominent Quaker and abolitionist Valentine Hicks, his wife Abigail, and their children. Hicks' father Elias Hicks [...] "had been the spark that helped convince Quakers and other like-minded people after the Revolutionary War that all men were created equal—including people of color who were enslaved". Valentine Hicks was also an Underground Railroad station master; in his home - a key way station - a <b>removable</b> <b>panel</b> behind an upstairs linen closet (that is still there today) concealed a staircase to the attic where Hicks hid runaways until the coast was clear. [...] The Town of Oyster Bay designated the site as a historic town landmark in 2012. In 2015 {{there was a lot of}} outrage over the preservation of this historic site. Partial demolition of the Maine Maid Inn took place without the approval of the Oyster Bay landmark commission, which outraged many preservationists.|$|E
50|$|Constructed from {{fiberglass}} {{the body}} was made from 13 inner and outer panels, including a floor panel, riveted and bonded together. The whole body was designed to bolt directly to an unmodified VW bug chassis. In the first prototypes stock front seats from Ford or VW were retained and a lounge-type seat was created for {{the rear of the}} vehicle. To add to the rear seating area a foot stool / cushion was added above the fuel tank. A single sliding door on the right side was the only entrance. The radio and switches were in the door panel {{to the left of the}} driving position. Shock absorbing bumpers of composite construction were designed to look like curved wood. The spare wheel was mounted to absorb frontal crash energy. For sunny days a large <b>removable</b> <b>panel</b> was positioned in the center of the roof panel. To reduce production costs parts from other vehicles were used. Front windshield was from an AMC Javelin, tail lights from a Datsun Truck and various other parts from a Ford Pinto.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the 101 was directed {{by the use of}} a <b>removable</b> control <b>panel.</b>|$|R

50|$|The P.119 was a {{cantilever}} monoplane, constructed completely of metal, with {{a conventional}} wide undercarriage. It had a forward-mounted cockpit, with the weapons mounted {{just behind the}} three-bladed propeller. It had advanced construction for the time, with many <b>removable</b> <b>panels</b> for internal inspection. The number of components were reduced to a minimum, and also standardized, to make construction as easy as possible. No other Italian aircraft was so advanced in these details.|$|R
