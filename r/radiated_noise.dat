40|$|ABSTRACTFor the {{analysis}} of <b>radiating</b> <b>noise</b> problems in medium-to-high frequency ranges, the Energy Flow Boundary Element Method (EFBEM) was developed. EFBEM is {{the analysis}} technique that applies the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to Energy Flow Analysis (EFA). The fundamental solutions representing spherical wave property for <b>radiating</b> <b>noise</b> problems in open field and considering the free surface effect in underwater are developed. Also the directivity factor is developed to express wave's directivity patterns in medium-to-high frequency ranges. Indirect EFBEM by using fundamental solutions and fictitious source was applied to open field and underwater noise problems successfully. Through numerical applications, the acoustic energy density distributions due to vibration of a simple plate model and a sphere model were {{compared with those of}} commercial code, and the comparison showed good agreement in the level and pattern of the energy density distributions...|$|R
2500|$|Passive sonar {{has several}} advantages, most {{importantly}} {{that it is}} silent. If the target <b>radiated</b> <b>noise</b> level is high enough, it can have a greater range than active sonar, and allows the target to be identified. Since any motorized object makes some noise, it may in principle be detected, depending {{on the level of}} noise emitted and the ambient noise level in the area, as well as the technology used. To simplify, passive sonar [...] "sees" [...] around the ship using it. On a submarine, nose-mounted passive sonar detects in directions of about 270°, centered on the ship's alignment, the hull-mounted array of about 160° on each side, and the towed array of a full 360°. The invisible areas are due to the ship's own interference. Once a signal is detected in a certain direction (which means that something makes sound in that direction, this is called broadband detection) it is possible to zoom in and analyze the signal received (narrowband analysis). This is generally done using a Fourier transform to show the different frequencies making up the sound. Since every engine makes a specific sound, it is straightforward to identify the object. Databases of unique engine sounds are part of what is known as acoustic intelligence or ACINT.|$|E

30|$|When a train {{passes over}} a bridge, {{vibrations}} are generated owing to irregularities in the wheels and the track. These vibrations cause the wheels and track to <b>radiate</b> <b>noise</b> and transfer energy directly to each {{component of the}} bridge, causing the beams, piers, and other components to vibrate, thus forming secondary noise radiation.

50|$|Ship {{silencing}} is {{an important}} part of reducing unwanted noise, which can severely limit a naval vessel's active and passive undersea warfare capability and decrease the range or probability of detection by an unfriendly vessel. The US Navy maintains a Ship Silencing Program to address these problems. The goals of the Ship Silencing Program are a reduction of sonar self noise over the frequency range of passive capable sonar and the reduction in the ship's <b>radiated</b> <b>noise</b> to reduce detection by enemy submarines. Self-noise is the noise generated by a ship that has an effect on its own sonar and sensors. <b>Radiated</b> <b>noise</b> is the noise generated by a ship that has an effect on other ship's sensors, especially submarines. The Masker-Prairie countermeasure systems are key elements in this program to reduce <b>radiated</b> <b>noise</b> and self-noise that are not reduced by controlling the sounds at their source or their transmission to the hull.|$|E

40|$|Extensive Experimental {{evidence}} {{is now available}} to support the observation {{that there are two}} components of jet mixing noise.

The fine scale turbulence noise dominates in the sideline and upstream directions. This study investigates the mechanism by which large turbulence structures <b>radiate</b> <b>noise.</b> It is believed that the mechanism is Mach wave radiation. Theoretical model results and physical reasonings are presented to support the Mach wave mechanism.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} the compressible Rayleigh equation {{as a model}} for the Mach wave emission mechanism associated with high temperature supersonic jets. Solutions to the compressible Rayleigh equation reveal the existence of several families of supersonically convecting instability waves. These waves directly <b>radiate</b> <b>noise</b> to the jet far field. The predicted noise characteristics are compared to previously acquired experimental data for an axisymmetric Mach 2 fully pressure balanced jet operating over a range of jet operating total temperatures from ambient to 1370 K. The results of this comparison show that the first order supersonic instability wave and the Kelvin-Helmholtz first, second, and third order modes have directional radiation characteristics that are in agreement with observed data. The assumption of equal initial amplitudes for all of the waves leads to the conclusion that the flapping mode of instability dominates the noise radiation process of supersonic jets. At a jet temperature of 1370 K, supersonic instability waves are predicted to dominate the <b>noise</b> <b>radiated</b> at high frequency at narrow angles to the jet axis...|$|R

50|$|An example {{propulsor}} {{is shown}} in the accompanying picture. It has a shroud which cuts down on blade-tip cavitation and <b>radiated</b> <b>noise.</b> It also has a rotor element and a stator. The stator concentrates the thrust in axial direction and reduces energy wasted in the tangential flow (therefore eliminating torque on the hull). The number of blades in the rotor and stator will typically be two different prime numbers to avoid standing waves. The blades in the rotor or the stator may be angled to further reduce noise. The physical design and layout is very much similar to a single stage axial-flow compressor.|$|E
