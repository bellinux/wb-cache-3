We performed three studies: 1) analysis of resin ducts in mango fruit exocarp to determine the density and area occupied by resin ducts in each mango cultivar, 2) assessment of mango physicochemical features including fruit sap content, and 3) a forced infestation trial under field conditions using enclosed fruit-bearing branches to expose mangoes to gravid A. ludens or A. obliqua females. Infestation rates, development time from egg to prepupae and pupae, pupal weight, and percent of adult emergence, were assessed. ?Ataulfo? and ?Tommy Atkins? cultivars exhibited the highest <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> density and sap content, the lowest infestation rate, and had a negative effect on immature development and pupal weight.

30|$|In {{response}} to biotic stress, conifers secrete an oleoresin that is composed mainly of mono- and diterpenes (Schmidt et al. [2010]). Oleoresin production {{may be associated}} with <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> formation in the cambium zone and developing xylem in {{response to}} insect attack or experimentally following methyl jasmonate treatment (Zulak and Bohlmann [2010]). In this study, applications of > 1 mg of ethephon induced significant resin secretion although there were no clear differences in <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> formation (Figure 4) over the duration of the experiment. The traumatic xylem that developed in stems treated with ethephon showed poorly lignified parenchymatous cells suffused with extractives (Figure 5). The lack of change in the size and number of the resin canals indicates that the effect of ethephon did not extend to the type of resin-duct formation that is associated with terpene synthesis over the time course of this experiment. By contrast, a similar treatment (1 % ethephon in lanolin) had been found previously to induce significant resinification as well as terpene-duct formation in P. halepensis (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 a]). Traumatic resin-duct formation after ethephon injection has also been observed in four-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and giant redwood trees (Sequoiadendron giganteum Lindl. Buchholz) (Hudgins and Franceschi [2004]). The higher levels of ethephon (5 and 25 mg) used in this study induced greater resin bleeding and bark splitting, and a reduction in stem girth and plant vitality leading to chlorosis.|$|E

In this study, we characterize drought-induced mortality affecting two Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) sites (Prades and Arcalís) located in the North Eastern Iberian Peninsula. Co-occurring now-dead and living Scots pine trees were sampled and their wood anatomical features were measured and compared. We aimed to detect differences in anatomical features between living and dead trees, and to infer past physiological performances that might have determined their subsequent death or survival. Now-dead trees showed lower tracheid and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> production, and smaller radial lumen diameters than co-occurring living trees. At the more xeric Prades site, these anatomical differences were larger and chronic, i. e. were observed over the three studied decades, whilst they were less pronounced at the other, more mesic Arcalís site, where tree mortality episodes were more recent. This indicates that dead trees’ hydraulic conductivity was severely affected and that carbon investment in xylem formation and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> production was constrained prior to tree death. Our findings show that both hydraulic deterioration and low carbon allocation to xylem formation were associated to drought-induced mortality in Scots pine.

As well as girdling the tree, a massive inoculation of blue stain fungus 2 ̆ 2 complex 2 ̆ 2 (composed of several species of Ceratocystis, numerous yeasts and other mycelial fungi) is made beneath the bark. These fungi colonize and destroy the parenchyma tissue system of the host sapwood, primarily the ray parenchyma and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> epithelium.

When spring bud break begins the year following beetle attack, terminal buds of blue-stained trees begin to expand, then abort. Soon after, the needles of these trees fade to a reddish brown color.

40|$|Recent {{epidemics}} of {{bark beetles}} (Curcurlionidae: Scolytinae) {{have not only}} revealed limitations {{in our understanding of}} bark beetle-pine host interactions, but have also revealed the presence of large variations in conifer defenses across seemingly small spatial scales. This variation has clear potential to affect the dynamics of bark beetle epidemics since coniferous tree defenses {{play an important role in}} bark beetle population dynamics. At the same time, evidence suggests that bark beetle epidemics are a strong form of selection on conifer defenses as beetles selectively attack less defended trees. This selection by bark beetles on tree defenses could create a mosaic of tree resistance across the landscape where forests impacted by more frequent or recent intense bark beetle infestations would have greater anti-bark beetle defenses. To elucidate the role of tree defenses in resistance to bark beetles, I investigated the effect of bark texture of limber pines (Pinus flexilis) on beetle attack densities and characterized the vertical resin ducts of limber pine and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) trees that were bark beetle susceptible (killed by bark beetles) to trees that were resistant (survived attack). Following these investigations, I characterized variation in resin defenses (characterizing both <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> and resin chemical traits) of limber, lodgepole, and ponderosa (Pinus ponderosa) pines across spatial (elevational) and ontogenetic (tree age) gradients of the Colorado Front Range. I found increasing proportional coverage by smooth bark was negatively related to bark beetle attacks/m 2 on limber pines. I also found resistant trees for both lodgepole and limber pine had significantly more resin ducts in recent xylem growth rings than susceptible trees. <b>Resin</b> <b>duct</b> production was also positively related to tree radial growth rates suggesting that both tree size/age (which are strongly associated with radial growth rates) and resource availability across spatial and temporal gradients is an important influence on pine tree anti-insect defenses. Similar to other forms of anti-insect defense (i. e. secondary chemistry, leaf toughness) both stem coverage by smooth bark and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> production are influenced by plant ontogeny whereby younger or smaller trees have greater defenses than older or larger trees. While historical selection pressure by bark beetles may have influenced current patterns of pine defenses, past and present human activities have strongly affected tree age structure in forests across elevation in the Colorado Front Range and elsewhere. At present, higher elevation forests tend to consist of older trees on average than lower elevation forests thereby creating an elevational gradient in pine anti-insect defenses that can be best explained by the underlying gradient in tree ontogeny and allometry...|$|E

In 1993 the National Park was founded and anthropogenic activities were restricted. To understand the response of P. Leucodermis at the upper tree-line to climatic and anthropogenic activity variations, we developed a tree-ring width chronology (1464 – 2003). For the period 1804 – 2003 separate chronologies for the earlywood and latewood were built, and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> density was assessed on total ring, earlywood and latewood. Age structure of saplings was also determined. After 1950 a steep decline in tree-ring width {{was followed by a}} recovery since 1981.

40|$|Forests play an {{important}} role in the earth system, regulating climate, maintaining biodiversity, and provisioning human communities with water, food and fuel. Interactions between climate and forest dynamics are not well constrained, and high uncertainty characterizes projections of global warming impacts on forests and associated ecosystem services. Recently observed tree mortality and forest die-off forewarn an acceleration of forest change with rising temperature and increased drought. However, the processes leading to tree death during drought are poorly understood, limiting our ability to anticipate future forest dynamics. The objective of this dissertation was to improve understanding of drought-associated tree mortality through literature synthesis and tree-ring studies on trees that survived and died during droughts in the southwestern USA. Specifically, this dissertation 1) documented global tree mortality patterns and identified emerging trends and research gaps; 2) quantified relationships between growth, climate, competition and mortality of piñon pine during droughts in New Mexico; 3) investigated tree defense anatomy as a potentially key element in piñon avoidance of death; and, 4) characterized the climate sensitivity of piñon resin ducts in order to gain insight into potential trends in tree defenses with climate variability and change. There has been an increase in studies reporting tree mortality linked to drought, heat, and the associated activity of insects and pathogens. Cases span the forested continents and occurred in water, light and temperature-limited forests. We hypothesized that increased tree mortality may be an emerging global phenomenon related to rising temperatures and drought (Appendix A). Recent radial growth was 53 % higher on average in piñon that survived versus died during two episodes of drought-associated mortality, and statistical models of mortality risk based on average growth, growth variability, and abrupt growth changes correctly classified the status of ~ 70 % of trees. Climate responses and competitive interactions partly explained growth differences between dying and surviving trees, with muted response to wet/cool conditions and enhanced sensitivity to competition from congeners linked to growth patterns associated with death. Discrimination and validation of models of mortality risk varied widely across sites and drought events, indicating shifting growth-mortality relationships and differences in mortality processes across space and time (Appendix B). Pre-formed defense anatomy is strongly associated with piñon survivorship over a range of sites and stand conditions. Models of mortality risk that account for both growth and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> attributes had≈ 10 ¹⁹ more support than models that contained only growth. The greatest improvement in classification was among trees from the 2000 s drought, suggesting an enhanced role for tree defense allocation and/or bark beetle activity during recent warm versus historic cool drought. Accounting for defense characteristics and growth-defense allocation is likely to be important for improving representation of drought-associated mortality (Appendix C). Piñon <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> chronologies contain climate responses that are coherent and distinct from those of radial growth. Growth responds positively and strongly to previous fall and current winter precipitation, and negatively to late spring and early summer temperature.

In this study we explore the relationship between GE, and other measures of vigor such as tree size, live crown ratio, growth increment, stem, foliage nutrients and root carbohydrate reserves. We then compare these measures of vigor with characteristics of tree defense such as density of resin ducts, monoterpenes and size of phloem lesions after inoculation with Grossmania clavigera (a blue stain fungus associated with MPB). In a field experiment we tested the suggested relationship between vigor and defense by thinning and fertilization in ten pure lodgepole pine stands in central Alberta. In the third summer after the fertilization and thinning treatment we inoculated trees with the blue stain fungus. The combination of fertilization and thinning increased GE and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> density but negatively impacted starch reserves. Lesion size increased with tree size in control plots, however, this relationship was lost when trees were fertilized and thinned. This suggests that treatments to increase growth rate also increased constitutive defenses in larger trees...|$|E
30|$|The {{utility of}} a {{microarray}} is best appreciated {{by the degree}} to which the results from this technology confirm or clarify well-characterised biological phenomena. The effect of long-term exposure to an ethylene-generating paste containing 2 -chloroethylphosphonic acid (ethephon) on the stem anatomy of Pinus radiata saplings was used as a physiological model to test heterologous hybridisation to the Pinus microarray. The response of xylogenesis to ethylene has not previously been studied adequately at the molecular level in Pinus species. Ethephon breaks down in plant tissues to form ethylene, a major plant hormone with diverse effects on the plant's physiology (Warner and Leopold [1969]). It is known that different Pinus species show clear responses to ethephon treatment. Previously, the application of an ethylene-generating paste has been found to induce localised radial stem growth in white pine (Pinus strobus L.) (Brown and Leopold [1973]). Ethylene also stimulated growth in bark and xylem tissues of Pinus halepensis Mill. (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 a]). Ethephon reduced lignification of tracheids in compression wood that developed on the underside of tilted stems of Pinus densiflora Siebold & Zucc. (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 b]). In P. halepensis, ethephon application implicated ethylene in the control of <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> formation (Yamamoto and Kozlowski [1987 a]). Ethephon sprays of 1 – 2 g L− 1 effectively reduced height and radial growth of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.) (Schnurr et al. [1996]).|$|E
40|$|Spruce, Picea sitchensis, {{were subject}} to high and low light and high and low {{nitrogen}} treatments in a polyhouse experiment. The effect of treatments on growth, needle and <b>resin</b> <b>duct</b> size, water content and concentration of quantitative defences (resin and polyphenols), sugars and nitrogen in needles, stems and roots was determined. 2. Concentrations of resin, polyphenols and carbohydrates were higher in low nitrogen treatments as predicted by resource-availability models of defence and the changes were similar {{in all parts of}} the trees including roots and in tissues formed prior to experimental treatments. Variation in the relative concentration of resin and poly-phenols between tissues may indicate a defensive trade-off. The size of needle resin ducts was positively correlated with tree growth but no evidence for ‘structural’ limitation of resin concentration in needles was found. 3. Changes in concentration of quantitative defences did not appear to be the result of a direct trade-off with growth but reflected treatment-induced variation in the root/shoot ratio. Production of quantitative secondary chemicals may therefore be part of an integrated response of the trees to environmental stress. 4. Bioassays with Elatobium abietinum, Gilpinia hercyniae and the fungus Phacidium coniferarum showed that changes in needle size, the nutritional and water content of tissues and the balance between nutrients and secondary chemicals influenced performance of one or more of the organisms. Changes in the concentration of carbon-based secondary chemicals alone were, therefore, of only limited value in predicting susceptibility of Spruce to insects and fungi...|$|E
40|$|Summary We {{investigated}} the cellular responses of stem tis-sues of mature Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees to inocula-tions with two fungal pathogens. The bark beetle vectored fungus, Leptographium wingfieldii Morelet, induced longer le-sions in the bark, stronger swelling of polyphenolic paren-chyma cells, more polyphenol accumulation and increased ray parenchyma activity {{compared with the}} root rot fungus, Het-erobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref., or mechanical wounding. Axial <b>resin</b> <b>ducts</b> in the xylem are a general feature of the pre-formed defenses of Scots pine, {{but there was no}} clear induction of additional traumatic axial <b>resin</b> <b>ducts</b> in response to wound-ing or fungal infection. The anatomical responses of Scots pine to pathogen infection were localized to the infection site and were attenuated away from bark lesions. The responses ob-served in Scots pine were compared with published studies on Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) for which anatomi-cally based defense responses have been well characterized...|$|R
40|$|Changes in the {{biogenic}} {{volatile organic}} compound (BVOC) emissions from European beech, Palestine oak, Scots pine, and Norway spruce exposed to heat stress were measured in a laboratory setup. In general, heat stress decreased the de novo emissions of monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and phenolic BVOC. Decreasing emission strength with heat stress was independent of the tree species and whether the de novo emissions being constitutive or induced by biotic stress. In contrast, heat stress induced emissions of green leaf volatiles. It also amplified the release of monoterpenes stored in <b>resin</b> <b>ducts</b> of conifers probably due to heat-induced damage of these <b>resin</b> <b>ducts.</b> The increased release of monoterpenes could be strong and long lasting. But, despite of such strong monoterpene emission pulses, {{the net effect of}} heat stress on BVOC emissions from conifers can be an overall decrease. In particular during insect attack on conifers the plants showed de novo emissions of sesquiterpenes and phenolic BVOC which exceeded constitutive monoterpene emissions from pools. The heat stress induced decrease of these de novo emissions was larger than the increased release caused by damage of <b>resin</b> <b>ducts.</b> We project that global change induced heat waves may cause increased BVOC emissions only in cases where the respective areas are predominantly covered with conifers that do not emit high amounts of sesquiterpenes and phenolic BVOC. Otherwise the overall effect of heat stress will be a decrease in BVOC emissions...|$|R
40|$|Corresponding author) Defense-related terpenoid {{biosynthesis}} in conifers is {{a dynamic}} process closely associated with specialized anatomical structures that allows conifers to cope with attack from many potential pests and pathogens. The constitutive and inducible terpenoid de-fense of conifers involves several hundred different monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and diterpenes. Changing arrays of these many compounds are formed from the general isoprenoid pathway by activities of large gene families for two classes of enzymes, the terpene synthases and the cytochrome P 450 -dependent monooxy-genases of the CYP 720 B group. Extensive studies have been con-ducted on the genomics, proteomics and molecular biochemical characterization of these enzymes. Many of the conifer terpene synthases are multi-product enzymes, and the P 450 enzymes of the CYP 720 B group are promiscuous in catalyzing multiple oxidations, along homologous series of diterpenoids, from {{a broad spectrum of}} substrates. The terpene synthases and CYP 720 B genes respond to authentic or simulated insect attack with increased transcript levels, protein abundance and enzyme activity. The constitutive and induced oleoresin terpenoids for conifer defense accumulate in preformed cortical <b>resin</b> <b>ducts</b> and in xylem trauma-associated <b>resin</b> <b>ducts.</b> Formation of these <b>resin</b> <b>ducts</b> de novo in the cambium zone and developing xylem, following insect attack or treatment of trees with methyl jasmonate, is a unique feature of the induced defense of long-lived conifer trees.
