40|$|Many LDCs have {{implemented}} reforms {{to strengthen the}} prudential regulation and supervision of their financial systems. This article examines the progress made by LDCs in implementing reforms, analyses the weaknesses in their prudential systems and discusses policy options for further reform. While considerable improvements have been achieved, the occurrence of banking crises during the 1990 s indicates that many countries have yet to build robust prudential systems which can protect their banking systems from systemic crises. The weaknesses include loopholes in the prudential regulations, shortages of skilled supervisors, and regulatory forbearance. Furthermore, there are difficulties in applying the developed country model of regulation, which relies heavily on accurate financial information, highly skilled technicians and an impartial bureaucracy, in an environment characterised by weak accounting and legal frameworks, acute shortages of skilled personnel and pervasive political interference in public administration. Options for further reform include higher capital adequacy standards, explicit rules covering intervention policy in distressed banks, <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> in banking markets and greater use {{of the market for}} monitoring banks.

Accordingly, the agency initiated a vigorous program of traditional antitrust enforcement, including merger oversight and investigations of hoth horizontal and vertical business activities. The theoretical framework proposed in this paper suggests that dedicating resources to traditional antitrust enforcement may not be an appropriate policy for a liberalizing economy.

Qualitative evidence suggests that the Federal Competition Commission has allocated its resources toward its competition advocacy role by challenging government-generated barriers to entry, growth and exit.

40|$|Private {{enforcement}} {{has long}} been a central part of US antitrust law experience, while it has played minor roles or none at all in European competition law systems. This contrast is fundamental to understanding differences between European and US competition law and to assessing the potential consequences of increasing the role of private enforcement of competition law in Europe. It is also central to decisions about competition law development in much of the world, because in this respect most competition law systems in the world resemble European competition laws rather than US antitrust law. In this essay, I examine the private enforcement of competition law in the US and Europe against the backdrop of efforts in Europe to rely more heavily on private enforcement in the enforcement of its competition law. As part of its so-called ‘modernization’ efforts, which went into effect on May 1, 2004, the European Commission seeks to reduce reliance on administrative authorities and to encourage those harmed by <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> to bring private law suits in national courts. There is, however, widespread uncertainty about the prospects for successfully incorporating private litigation into European competition law systems. There is also uncertainty about which, if any, measures should be taken to enhance acceptance of private enforcement. In assessing these issues, a comparative perspective can be of much value. It can provide a basis—perhaps the only basis—for making informed decisions...|$|R
40|$|For {{the first}} time in 2005 the Federal Cartel Office {{prohibited}} two concentrations of municipal and private hospitals because they were expected to create or strengthen a dominant position in the market. The High court of Duesseldorf (OLG) confirmed this view. An appeal is pending with the Supreme Federal Court of Justice (BGH) and will likely be ruled on in early summer 2008. Parallel to this appeal process a petition for a ministerial authorisation was forwarded which was supported by the Monopolies Commission. The petition was refused by the Minster for economic affairs and technology (Michael Glos). This article shows that the application of merger control regulations to hospital fusions is counterproductive. The intervention of the Federal Cartel Office means that not more but less competition will be generated. Moreover, the danger arises that the interdiction of hospital fusions will prevent the hospitals from fulfilling their services of general interest to a sufficient extent (Art. 86 II Treaty on European Union). Furthermore, the article shows that the peremptory regulation in Paragraph 69 Social Security Code V (SGB V) allows no opportunity worth mentioning for the application of the regulations on merger controle in the act against <b>Restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>Competition</b> (GWB). If however these rules should be applied to hospital fusions the product market and the geographical market will have to be defined differenty: Geographically in non urban regions the market cachement area extens between 250 and 300 km, in urban areas it dwindles to approximately 150 km.

40|$|The {{baseball}} {{strike and}} the ongoing hostilities between the players 2 ̆ 7 association and owners have evoked criticism and frustration among fans and others. Although the players successfully defeated the owners 2 ̆ 7 most recent attempts to reduce major league competition, the threat of future imposition of competitive restraints by the owners remains. In this article Professor Stephen F. Ross argues that blanket <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> the market for players affirmatively inhibit on-the-field competition and consequently offend the Sherman Act. The article begins with the proposition that monopsony - price-fixing behavior by buyers 2 ̆ 7, rather than sellers 2 ̆ 7 cartels - implicates the Sherman Act. <b>Restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> for players 2 ̆ 7 services are thus not exempt from the antitrust laws. As the author notes, restraints of trade imposed by sports leagues are subject to antitrust scrutiny under a rule of reason: under the standard set forth in NCAA v. Board of Regents, such restraints are permissible where reasonably tailored to promote competitive balance. Professor Ross then applies the NCAA standard to blanket restraints imposed by sports leagues. He first demonstrates that the waiver rule employed by some leagues is tailored to promote league competition, because it allows inferior teams with large payrolls to rapidly improve in the standings by acquiring superior players. To counter the owners 2 ̆ 7 arguments that restraints such as salary caps are necessary to maintain league competition, Professor Ross relies on empirical evidence {{of the effect of}} these <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> competitive balance and demonstrates that, in addition to not promoting competition, blanket restraints affirmatively harm competitive balance. Salary caps, the author argues, not only transfer wealth from players to owners, but facilitate bland, uninteresting seasons in which the same teams have consistently good or bad win-loss records. The article includes a discussion of less restrictive means of promoting competitive balance, including revenue sharing and progressive salary caps, which might pass antitrust muster. Professor Ross concludes that free competition in the player market protects the interests of both fans and players, such that an alliance of consumers and players might be an effective way to combat the threat to baseball which blanket restraints may pose in the future...|$|R
40|$|Antitrust {{policy and}} the IP laws are both {{concerned}} with practices that restrain competition unnecessarily by reducing {{the size of the}} public domain beyond that which the Constitution contemplates, or as Congress intended for them to be expanded. In fact, antitrust has a dual role as promoter of competition in IP intensive markets. It regulates both <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> and <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> innovation. The first line protector of the competitive process in innovation is the IP statutes themselves. The Constitutional Mandate to Congress to create intellectual property regimes in order to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts is expressly tied to creating incentives to innovate. Indeed, the IP Clause is the only place where the Constitution expressly links the scope of a property right to the incentive to develop it. An optimal IP policy creates just enough incentive to cause creative people to innovate at the optimal level, but not so much so as to restrain excessively others who want to build on their work. Maintaining this balance requires a determination of both the optimal duration and the optimal scope, or coverage, of IP rights. Antitrust should not be too defensive about asserting a broader role in IP/competition disputes. This is so for two reasons. First, the extent of special interest capture is significantly greater in IP law than in antitrust, although today patent is experiencing some important reforms. Second, antitrust has profited greatly from its period in the wilderness, something that the IP laws have yet to experience. While no statute is free of special interest influence, the antitrust laws must be counted among the relatively cleaner substantive statutory regimes in the United States code. Antitrust has the comparative advantage of well behaved doctrine that, at least currently, is reasonable free of special interest pressure. The patent and copyright acts cannot make the same claim to well behaved doctrine, although patent law seems to be entering its own period of self-criticism and reform...|$|R
40|$|Entry {{into and}} {{competition}} within professions and many industries is commonly restricted by private regulation among competitors. These restrictions are often effectuated, without direct government participation, through rules, procedures, or standards established by trade or professional organizations. Sometimes, however, the restrictions are made through less formalized concerted decisionmaking procedures by persons potentially {{in competition with}} new entrants. Such privately imposed <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> have recently {{been the focus of}} an increasing number of private treble damages actions under section 1 of the Sherman Act. In these cases, the plaintiffs have alleged that the defendants were engaged in illegal boycotts, and that the defendants had no valid antitrust defense. The resolution of these cases by the appellate courts suggests the existence of substantial confusion concerning the application of antitrust boycott law as developed by the Supreme Court. This confusion has engendered protracted litigation. The ambiguity with respect to antitrust boycott law has been underscored by several recent nonboycott Sherman Act decisions by the Court. This Article first identifies the apparent sources of disagreement among the courts concerning the rules and elements of boycott law, particularly when applied to industry or professional self-regulation conducted for arguably non-anticompetitive purposes. Next, the Article discusses the rationale employed by the Supreme Court in boycott decisions and the attempted application of this rationale in a number of representative lower court decisions. Finally, this Article suggests that, contrary to some recent writing on the subject, the doctrine of per se illegality, when appropriately invoked, has remained essentially unchanged. Therefore, lower courts should apply the per se doctrine to various forms of private regulatory activity undertaken without governmental approval...|$|R
40|$|In this Article {{we focus}} upon {{an area in}} which greater {{convergence}} of U. S. policy with the practice of many foreign countries is long overdue: the treatment of public policies that suppress competition. Whereas the European Union (“EU”) and numerous other jurisdictions have taken strong measures to limit restraints imposed by national government authorities and political subdivisions, U. S. antitrust policy in many ways is more tolerant of public restraints upon business rivalry. Since the early twentieth century, Supreme Court doctrines have evolved to grant states and the federal government broad rights to enact laws that restrain competition. Further, individual groups are largely free to lobby for laws designed to erect marketplace barriers, and in many cases to mire their competitors in a morass of governmental processes. Because government action (and private conduct to obtain such action) is challengeable in only relative narrow circumstances, much of the battle takes place in the legislative and regulatory arenas rather than in courts. Accordingly, advocacy is the primary tool available to both public and private enforcers of the U. S. antitrust laws to challenge state-imposed <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition.</b> Although the U. S. competition advocacy program has achieved important success, it is not enough. United States enforcers should stand on equal footing with their EU and other foreign counterparts in being able to challenge state action that threatens competition {{in the same manner as}} they can challenge private conduct. In this paper, we describe measures available to competition authorities in the U. S. and other jurisdictions to resist encroachments by government policies on the competitive process. We suggest approaches by which the framework of controls upon anticompetitive government policies could be strengthened in the United States...|$|R
40|$|Around the world, the {{allocation}} of individual rights in the fisheries {{has proved to be}} a successful fisheries management tool. To date, the Individual Transferable Quota [ITQ] approach has been adopted for only a few fisheries in the U. S., although there is strong support for extending the approach to others. The basic goal of the ITQ approach is to create well-defined, exclusive property rights in a fishery, giving holders of those rights the incentive to fish efficiently and manage the resource for long-term sustainable yield. The property rights allocated are often percentage shares of the total annual allowable harvest or quota for the particular fishery. The transferability of these shares is key to the ITQ approach-being marketable, the shares will come to be owned by those who will most efficiently utilize them. Analysis of the ITQ approach, however, gives rise to the question of whether ITQ programs will have effects resulting in violations of U. S. antitrust law. The Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act all serve to protect consumers from anticompetitive activity. Once shares in a fishery are placed on the market, will trading result in single-owner accumulation of shares approaching monopoly in violation of these statutes? Will impermissible domination of competition and pricing result from concentrations of shares in the hands of a few? This Article examines the legal implications of ITQs with regard to antitrust law. It begins by identifying the benefits of the ITQ approach and considering the potential anticompetitive effects of an ITQ system. It then discusses the legal requirements for finding of monopoly, illegal price restraints and other impermissible <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition.</b> The Article concludes that ITQ systems can be designed to avert the possibility of excessive accumulation of shares in the hands of a few, and that such ITQ systems are unlikely to have effects that will result in antitrust violations...|$|R

30|$|Legislation in {{a free-market}} {{economic}} {{system does not}} tolerate attempts by entities to restrain or limit competition among providers of goods or services. Accordingly, a <b>restraint</b> or limitation <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> generally will be allowed only if it serves some important purpose. Over the years, health care organizations have recognized that a limitation <b>on</b> <b>competition</b> is acceptable if it protects a party from unfair competition. In this context, self-referral {{can be regarded as}} unfair internal competition with regard to services provided by a referral-based radiology department. Individual and interdepartmental economic competition and new technologies may renew competitive forces to obtain leadership positions and market share. These forces can become overwhelming and may stimulate detrimental competition for patients, space, and resources [6]. Moreover, internal competition among specialists interested in imaging may result in disagreements and may even begin to strain normally collegial relationships. On the other hand, a mutually beneficial arrangement among the specialties requires minimization of internal competition as well as adequate patient volume and economic resources for all participants. Competition must be therefore based externally on quality and cost, not internally among members of the group [25].|$|R

40|$|Antitrust’s rule {{of reason}} {{was born out of}} a thirty year (1897 - 1927) {{division}} among Supreme Court Justices about the proper way to assess multi-firm <b>restraints</b> <b>on</b> <b>competition.</b> By the late 1920 s the basic contours of the rule for restraints among competitors was roughly established. Antitrust policy toward vertical restraints remained much more unstable, however, largely because their effects were so poorly understood. This article provides a litigation field guide for antitrust claims under the {{rule of reason}} – or more precisely, for situations when application of the rule of reason is likely. At the time pleadings are drafted and even up to the point of summary judgment, the parties are often uncertain whether a court will apply the rule of reason. Because the choice of rule presents a question of law, it is generally established prior to trial. The first section examines pleading and summary judgment rules, including the role of stare decisis, arguing that stare decisis should apply to a mode of analysis rather than to a specific class of restraints. Then it discusses numerous problems surrounding the burden of proof and the quality of evidence needed to shift the burden or get to a jury. I argue that the plaintiff’s burden for a prima facie case should be relatively stringent for the market power requirement, but relatively light for proof of an anticompetitive act. I also show why a consumer welfare standard for antitrust violations is the only manageable one for evaluating practices under the rule of reason. The alternative, general welfare standard requires that all consumer losses be quantified and compared with producer efficiency gains, as well as likely effects on others. Aside from any substantive reasons for preferring a consumer welfare standard, a general welfare standard is impossible to apply in any but the most obvious cases. The consumer welfare standard queries only whether output will be higher or lower (or prices lower or higher) under the restraint. This query can be difficult enough but is nevertheless much simpler than the proof requirements for a general welfare standard. Finally, this section examines the possibility of truncated, or “quick look,” analysis as an alternative to both the rule of reason and the per se rule, arguing against recognition of any categorical “quick look. ” I conclude with a brief discussion of “balancing,” and why the rule of reason’s staged set of queries is designed so that courts can avoid balancing whenever possible. The next section considers how to identify the types of conduct to which antitrust’s rule of reason should be applied. It also examines the question of appropriate remedies, particularly when the basic features of joint activity are either unchallenged or conceded to be competitive, but a specific provision or practice threatens competition. Then it turns briefly to the special case of antitrust restraints in markets for intellectual property rights. A final section examines the market structure requirements for antitrust rule of reason cases, including vertical agreements as well as agreements that have both horizontal and vertical elements. For rule of reason cases involving collaborative conduct generally, market power requirements should be less than those for single firm conduct. The principal exception is vertical exclusionary agreements (mainly, tying and exclusive dealing), where power requirements should be equivalent to those used in monopolization cases...|$|R
