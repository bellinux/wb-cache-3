40|$|We compare {{aging in}} a disordered {{ferromagnet}} {{and in a}} spin glass, by studying the different phases of a <b>reentrant</b> <b>system.</b> We have measured the relaxation of the low-frequency ac susceptibility, in both the ferromagnetic and spin-glass phases of a CdCr_{ 1. 9 }In_{ 0. 1 }S_ 4 sample. A restart of aging processes when the temperature is lowered (`chaos-like' effect) is observed in both phases. The memory of previous aging at a higher temperature can be retrieved upon re-heating, but in the ferromagnetic phase it can rapidly be erased by the growth of ferromagnetic domains. We interpret the behaviour observed in the ferromagnetic phase {{in terms of a}} combination of domain growth and pinned wall reconformations, and suggest that aging in spin glasses is dominated by such wall reconformation processes.

The layer spacing measurements show that the smectic A phase is probably of the partially bilayer type.

In addition to Mn 3 + anisotropy, the random substitution of diamagnetic ion at A-sites introduces further disorder in B-sites resulting in weakening of AB bonds. The results are compared with isotropic canted ferrites and <b>reentrant</b> <b>systems.</b> By applying ferromagnetic scaling law, successive transitions are identified as a function of temperature: paramagnetism to short-range order (or cluster state) to ferrimagnetism or canted magnetic state, depending on concentration range. The effect of random anisotropies gives rise to modified magnetic properties at low temperatures (T < 20 K) which mimic local canted state features, while spin-glass-like phase could exist at very low field and low temperature...|$|R

40|$|A new, fast, single-pulse {{diagnostic}} {{for determining}} phase transitions and measuring the bulk temperature of polycrystalline metal objects has been developed. The diagnostic {{consists of a}} 37 -stage Marx bank with a cable-coupled X-ray diode that produces a 35 -ns pulse of mostly 0. 71 -{angstrom} monochromatic X rays and a P- 43 fluor coupled to a cooled, charge-coupled device camera by a coherent fiber-optic bundle for detection of scattered X rays.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the effects of {{quenched}} random disorder created by dispersed aerosil nanoparticle gels on the nematic to smectic-A (N-SmA) and smectic-A to reentrant nematic (SmA- RN) phase transitions of thermotropic liquid crystal mixtures of 6 OCB (hexyloxycyanobiphenyl) and 8 OCB (octyloxycyanobiphenyl). These effects are probed using high-resolution synchrotron x-ray diffraction techniques. We find that the reentrant characteristics of the system are largely unchanged {{by the presence of}} the aerosil gel network. By comparing measurements of the smectic static structure amplitude for this 8 OCB- 6 OCB+aerosil system with those for butyloxybenzilidene-octylaniline (4 O. 8) +aerosil gels, we find that the short-range smectic order in the smectic-A phase is significantly weaker in the <b>reentrant</b> <b>system.</b> This result is consistent with the behavior seen in pure 8 OCB- 6 OCB mixtures. The strength of the smectic ordering decreases progressively as the 6 OCB concentration is increased. Detailed line shape analysis shows that the high- and low-temperature nematic phases (N and RN) are similar to each other. Comment: 34 Pages, 11 Figures, A regular Article submitted to PR...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the liquid-vapor interface {{of a model}} of patchy colloids. This model consists of hard spheres decorated with short-ranged attractive sites ("patches") of different types on their surfaces. We focus on a one-component fluid with two patches of type A and nine patches of type B (2 A 9 B colloids), which {{has been found to}} exhibit reentrant liquid-vapor coexistence curves and very low-density liquid phases. We have used the density-functional theory form of Wertheim's first-order perturbation theory of association, as implemented by Yu and Wu [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 7094 (2002) ], to calculate the surface tension, and the density and degree of association profiles, at the liquid-vapor interface of our model. In <b>reentrant</b> <b>systems,</b> where AB bonds dominate, an unusual thickening of the interface is observed at low temperatures. Furthermore, the surface tension versus temperature curve reaches a maximum, in agreement with Bernardino and Telo da Gama's mesoscopic Landau-Safran theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 109, 116103 (2012) ]. If BB attractions are also present, competition between AB and BB bonds gradually restores the monotonic temperature dependence of the surface tension. Lastly, the interface is "hairy," i. e., it contains a region where the average chain length is close to that in the bulk liquid, but where the density is that of the vapor. Sufficiently strong BB attractions remove these features, and the system reverts to the behavior seen in atomic fluids...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} obtain the better {{analysis}} of the multiple <b>reentrant</b> manufacturing <b>systems</b> (MRMSs), their modeling and analysis from both micro- and macroperspectives are considered.

This continuum model {{takes into account the}} re-entrant degree of products, and its effectiveness is verified through numerical experiments. Finally, based on the discrete event simulation and the modified continuum models, a numerical example is used to analyze the MRMS.

40|$|A novel ultrafast {{diagnostic}} {{for determining}} bulk temperature and phase transitions for polycrystalline metal objects has been developed. The diagnostic {{consists of a}} 38 -stage Marx bank with a cable-coupled X-ray diode that produces a 35 -ns pulse of mostly 0. 71 Å monochromatic X rays, and a P- 43 fluor coupled to a cooled charge-coupled device camera by a coherent fiber-optic bundle for detection of scattered X rays. The X-ray beam is collimated to a 1 ° divergence in the scattering plane with {{the combination of a}} 1. 5 -mm tungsten pinhole and a 1. 5 -mm diameter molybdenum anode. The X-ray diode, in a needle-and-washer configuration, is heavily shielded in all directions other than the collimated beam. The X-ray diode has a sealed <b>reentrant</b> <b>system,</b> which allows the X rays to be produced inside a vacuum containment vessel, close to the sample under study. The direct correlation between the solid-state structure and the coherent X-ray diffraction pattern from a metal surface allows an unequivocal determination of a phase transition. This correlation has been tested in the laboratory with samples of indium and tin. For both metals, diffraction lines were observed at temperatures just below the melt temperature, along with background consisting of Compton scattering and sample fluorescence. Upon melt, the diffraction lines were observed to disappear; however, the background from Compton scattering and sample fluorescence remained. Flash X-ray diffraction also enables direct ultrafast measurements of the bulk temperature of the sample under study. According to the Debye-Waller theory, the diffracted line intensity reduces as the temperature of the sample increases. The amplitude of the reduced diffracted signal also depends on the Debye temperature of the sample, the scattering angle of the diffracted X rays, and the X-ray wavelength. The feasibility of using the Debye-Waller theory for flash X-ray diffraction measurements of the bulk temperature is currently being studied...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the control of a <b>reentrant</b> manufacturing <b>system</b> with setup times, as introduced by Kumar and Seidman. In most literature on control {{of a network of}} servers with setup times, first a policy is introduced and then the resulting network behavior is analyzed. In manufacturing systems the network typically is fixed and given a priori. Furthermore, optimal steady state behavior is desired. Therefore, this paper follows a different approach. First optimal steady state network behavior is determined, then a feedback controller is presented which makes the network converge towards this desired steady state behavior. The resulting controller is a non-distributed controller: each server needs global state information. For a manufacturing system this is not a problem, since global information typically is available. Finally it is shown that a distributed controller (each server needs only local state information) {{can also be used to}} achieve the same result...|$|R

40|$|Efficient control schemes are {{required}} for effective cooperation of robot teams in a mobile wireless sensor network. If the robots (resources) are also in charge of executing multiple simultaneous missions, then risks of deadlocks due {{to the presence of}} shared resources among different missions increase and have to be tackled. Discrete event control with deadlock avoidance has been used in the past for robot team coordination for the case of multi reentrant flowline models with shared resources. In this paper we present an analysis of deadlock avoidance for a generalized case of multi <b>reentrant</b> flow line <b>systems</b> (MRF) called the Free Choice Multi <b>Reentrant</b> Flow Line <b>systems</b> (FMRF). In FMRF, some tasks have multiple resource choices; hence routing decisions have to be made and current results in deadlock avoidance for MRF do not hold. This analysis is based on the so-called Circular Waits (CW) of the resources in the system. For FMRF, the well known notions of Critical Siphons and Critical Subsystems must be generalized and we redefine these objects for such systems. Our second contribution provides a matrix formulation that efficiently computes the objects required for deadlock avoidance in FMRF systems. A MAXWIP dispatching policy is formulated for deadlock avoidance in FMRF systems. According to this policy, deadlock in FMRF is avoided by limiting the work in progress (WIP) in the critical subsystems of each CW. Implemented results of the proposed scheme in a WSN test-bed is presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The European X-ray Free Electron Laser (E-XFEL) {{will use}} {{reentrant}} beam position monitors (BPMs) in about {{one quarter of}} the superconducting cryomodules. This BPM is composed of a radiofrequency (RF) reentrant cavity with 4 antennas and an RF signal processing electronics. Hybrid couplers, near the cryomodules, generate the analog sum and difference of the raw pickup signals coming from two pairs of opposite RF feedthroughs. The resulting sum (proportional to bunch charge) and difference signals (proportional to the product of position and charge) are then filtered, down-converted by an RF front-end (RFFE), digitized, and digitally processed on an FPGA board. The task of CEA/Saclay was to cover the design, fabrication and beam tests and deliver these reentrant cavity BPMs for the E-XFEL linac in collaboration with DESY and PSI.

40|$|Granular Fe(1 1 0) {{thin films}} have been grown on c-sapphire {{substrates}} by triode sputtering. Islands size range from 11 nm in-plane diameter and 2 nm height up to 100 nm in-plane and 23 nm height, {{depending on the}} deposition time. Strong changes in the spin-dependent scattering are found in samples with in-plane diameter below 30 nm. This behavior {{is due to a}} low-temperature spin freezing of the island boundary magnetic regions, producing a suppression of the exchange coupling between islands. A consequence of the magnetic decoupling is the random arrangement of the individual magnetization, determined by the magnetocrystalline anisotropy of each island, that results in a spin-dependent induced increase of the resistivity below the freezing temperature. By applying a high enough magnetic field, magnetic ordering recovers regardless of the temperature, obtaining a typical metallic behavior for the thermal dependence of the resistivity. The ratio of the low-temperature resistivities with and without magnetic field yields magnetoresistance values up to 5. 5 % for 16. 5 nm in-plane island sizes. The following two conclusions are obtained: (i) nanocrystalline Fe can be considered as a low-temperature GMR-like system and (ii) Fe grain boundaries are not ferromagnetic at low temperature but behave as a <b>reentrant</b> spin-glass <b>system.</b> This work has been performed under financial support of Spanish Commission of Science and Technology (MAT 98 - 0965 -C 04 - 03, MAT 98 - 0974 -C 03 - 01, MAT 99 - 1063 -C 04 - 03) Peer reviewe...|$|R
