40|$|Surface {{treatment}} {{technologies are}} commonly used to enhance the adhesion potential of base flexible packaging substrates {{for the application of}} performance adhesives, coatings and inks. The relationship between <b>ribbon</b> <b>burner</b> flame treatment technology and enhanced velocity (EV) port burner technology, and the degree of surface modification for adhesion promotion, is compared. Results showed that packages subjected to flame treatment prior to coating and printing performed significantly better, providing significant benefits. The subsequent measurement of dyne levels, peel adhesion and longevity tests following separate <b>ribbon</b> <b>burner</b> and drilled port flame surface treatments of various flexible packaging materials indicated definable differences between flame burner technologies and their effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} studies {{were conducted to}} determine the acceptability of a ribbon-burner simulation of engine conditions for testing ceramic-lined turbine tip shrouds. The calculated values reveal that the <b>ribbon</b> <b>burner</b> establishes at least as harsh a thermal environment as is present at any time within the turbine shroud. Comparisons were made with ceramic components in a turboshaft engine...|$|E
40|$|Paper drying is {{the most}} {{energy-intensive}} and temperature-critical aspect of papermaking. It is estimated that about 67 % of the total energy required in papermaking is used to dry paper. The conventional drying method uses a series of steam-heated metal cylinders that are required to meet ASME codes for pressure vessels, which limits the steam pressure to about 160 psig. Consequently, the shell temperature and the drying capacity are also limited. Gas Technology Institute together with Boise Paper Solutions, Groupe Laparrier and Verreault (GL&V) USA Inc., Flynn Burner Corporation and with funding support from the U. S. Department of Energy, U. S. natural gas industry, and Gas Research Institute is developing a high efficiency gas-fired paper dryer based {{on a combination of}} a <b>ribbon</b> <b>burner</b> and advanced heat transfer enhancement technique. The Gas-Fired Paper Dryer (GFPD) is a high-efficiency alternative to conventional steam-heated drying drums that typically operate at surface temperatures in the 300 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂºF range. The new approach was evaluated in laboratory and pilot-scale testing at the Western Michigan University Paper Pilot Plant. Drum surface temperatures of more than 400 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂºF were reached with linerboard (basis weight 126 lb/ 3000 ft 2) production and resulted in a 4 - 5 times increase in drying rate over a conventional steam-heated drying drum. Successful GFPD development and commercialization will provide large energy savings to the paper industry and increase paper production rates from dryer-limited (space- or steam-limited) paper machines by an estimated 10 to 20 %, resulting in significant capital costs savings for both retrofits and new capacity...|$|E
50|$|Tubing in {{external}} diameters {{ranging from}} about 8-15 mm with a 1 mm wall thickness is most commonly used, although 6 mm tubing is now commercially available in colored glass tubes. The tube is heated in sections using {{several types of}} burners that are selected according {{to the amount of}} glass to be heated for each bend. These <b>burners</b> include <b>ribbon,</b> cannon, or crossfires, as well as a variety of gas torches. <b>Ribbon</b> <b>burners</b> are strips of fire that make the gradual bends while crossfires, when used, make the sharp bends.|$|R
