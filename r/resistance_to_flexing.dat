30|$|It {{has been}} noted {{previously}} that visually the A. minus hook does not taper in diameter {{from the top of}} the shaft. There is an increase in material on the shoulder of the hook before it tapers to a point. This influences the hook’s behaviour in tension, increasing its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flexing,</b> increasing its attachment to its host and its disposition to fracture, not bend.|$|E
40|$|This article {{presents}} a novel method for accelerated wear of squeegees used in screen printing and describes {{the development of}} mechanical tests which allow more in-depth measurement of squeegee properties. In this study, squeegees were abraded on the screen press {{so that they could}} be used for subsequent print tests to evaluate the effect of wear on the printed product. Squeegee wear was found to vary between different squeegee types and caused increases in ink transfer and wider printed features. In production this will lead to greater ink consumption, cost per unit and a likelihood of product failure. This also has consequences for the production of functional layers, etc., used in the construction of printed electronics. While more wear generally gave greater increases in ink deposition, the effect of wear differed, depending on the squeegee. There was a correlation between the angle of the squeegee wear and ink film thickness from a worn squeegee. An ability to resist flexing gave a high wear angle and presented a sharper edge at the squeegee/screen interface thus mitigating the effect of wear. There was also a good correlation between <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flexing</b> and ink film thickness for unworn squeegees, which was more effective than a comparison based on Shore A hardness. Squeegee indentation at different force levels gave more information than a standard Shore A hardness test and the apparatus used was able to reliably measure reductions in surface hardness due to solvent absorption. Increases in ink deposition gave lower resistance in printed silver lines; however, the correlation between the amount of ink deposited and the resistance, remained the same for all levels of wear, suggesting that the wear regime designed for this study did not induce detrimental print defects such as line breakages...|$|E

40|$|Sodium {{montmorillonite}} (Na-Mt) {{was modified}} by cetyltriemethylammoniumbromide (CTAB) through cation exchange technique followed by grafting with 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APT). The effects of organophillic surface treatments of montmorillonite on compatibilization of natural rubber (NR) /acrylonitrile butadiene rubber (NBR) blends was investigated. Physico-mechanical properties of rubber nanocomposites compatibilized with organomodified montmorillonite revealed strong nanocomposite with high tensile properties, impact strength and good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flex</b> fatigue, abrasion and compression set. Dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) revealed a marked increase in storage modulus (E') and lesser damping characteristics of organically modified clay mineral polymer nanocomposites (CPN) due to intercalation of organophilic montmorillonite by rubber matrix. The morphology of the blends became homogeneous and smoother {{with the presence}} of exofoliated/intercalated organically modified montmorillonite. Organomodified layered silicate sheets of montmorillonite greatly enhanced barrier properties by creating tortuous path that retarded the progress of solvent molecules through rubber matrix...|$|R

40|$|Effect {{of mineral}} fillers {{modified}} with amino-functional derivatives on properties of natural rubber compounds was studied. To improve {{the performance of}} rubber compounds, three types of locally available mineral fillers; kaolin, kaolinite and quartz were modified through ion-exchange process and used as reinforcing fillers. The clays were thus modified with three types of organic quaternary ammonium ions. They were thiourium, ammonium succinimate and para ammino phenolate. Sieve fractionating and sedimentation analysis were performed to find the particle size distribution of the tested fillers. Cation exchange capacities of tested fillers were determined using Kjedhal experiment. Obtained results were used to perform the ion-exchange reaction keeping stoicheometrically balanced ratios of modifying exchangeable cations and kaolins Modified and unmodified fillers were compounded with rubber. Physico -mechanical properties of rubber compounds such as tensile, aging, <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>flex</b> cracking, crack growth, and abrasion were determined and analyzed. To evaluate the interaction of rubber with filler surface bound rubber content and swelling tests were performed. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Differential Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (DTG) were used to confirm the course of ion-exchange reaction. Microphotographs were taken to evaluate the quality of dispersion and distribution of fillers in rubber compounds. Obtained results demonstrated advantages of rubber compounds filled with modified fillers. Better performance was achieved on account of improved compatibility and intensified interaction of modified fillers with rubber. It was found that reinforcing effect introduced to rubber by thiourium cations modified clay was especially strong. Proposed mechanism of reinforcement of rubber with thiourium cations modified clay referred to formation of chemical links across rubber-filler interface. Effect of particle size of the clay fines on cation exchange capacity and reinforcing capability of modified fillers was established. Larger contactar aera and increased cation exchange capacity of the small size filler particles permitted arrangement of increased number of active centers {{on the surface of}} the filler particles that resulted in strong reinforcing effect similar to that, achieved with carbon blacks...|$|R

The parameters of the crack growth <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> the repeated <b>flexing</b> differ in 1. 1 – 1. 4 times.
