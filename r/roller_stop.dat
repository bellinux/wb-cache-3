40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} a novel robotic end-effector and {{a method for}} grasping deformable objects with undefined shapes and geometry, such as sacks and bags. The first prototype end-ef-fector, designed for applications in the U. S. Postal Service, is com-prised of two parallel rollers with gripping surfaces in which the rollers are pushed toward each other. When the end-effector comes into contact with any portion of the deformable object, the rollers turn inwardly so that a graspable portion of the object is dragged between the <b>rollers.</b> The <b>rollers</b> <b>stop</b> rotating when a graspable por-tion of the material/object is caught in between, allowing the ob-ject to be maneuvered by the robot. The object is released when the rollers turn outwardly. The end-effector described in this ar-ticle can grab and hold filled sacks from any point on the sack, re-gardless of the sack’s orientation. Experimental evaluation of the end-effector has proven the design and implementation remark...|$|R

2500|$|Whilst this {{is going}} on, the spindle {{carriage}} is being drawn away from the rollers, at a pace very slightly exceeding {{the rate at which}} the roving is coming forth. This is called the [...] gain of the carriage, its purpose being to eliminate all irregularities in the fineness of the thread. Should a thick place in the roving come through the rollers, it would resist the efforts of the spindle to twist it; and, if passed in this condition, it would seriously deteriorate the quality of the yarn, and impede subsequent operations. As, however, the twist, spreading itself over the level thread, gives firmness to this portion, the thick and untwisted part yields to the draught of the spindle, and, as it approaches the tenuity of the remainder, it receives the twist it had hitherto refused to take. The carriage, which is borne upon wheels, continues its outward progress, until it reaches the extremity of its traverse, which is [...] from the roller beam. The revolution of the spindles cease, the drawing <b>rollers</b> <b>stop.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Advantages of this {{conveyor}} {{are quiet}} operation, easy installation, moderate maintenance and low expense. Line-shaft conveyors are also extremely safe {{for people to}} work around because the elastic belts can stretch and not injure fingers should any get caught underneath them. Moreover, the spools will slip and allow the <b>rollers</b> to <b>stop</b> moving if clothing, hands or hair gets caught in them. In addition, since the spools are slightly loose on the shaft, they act like clutches that slip when products are required to accumulate (stop moving and bump up against each other. i.e. queue up). With the exception of soft bottomed containers like cement bags, these conveyors can be utilized for almost all applications.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{dynamics}} of a macroscopic grain rolling on an inclined plane composed of fixed identical grains is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. As real sand, the system exhibits an hysteretic transition between static and dynamical states: for angles smaller than d, the <b>roller</b> always <b>stops,</b> for angles larger than s, it spontaneously starts rolling down. But for angles between d and s, {{it can be}} either at rest or in motion with a constant velocity. It is shown that the limit velocity is given by the equilibrium between gravity driving and dissipation by the shocks. Moreover, the rough plane acts as a periodic potential trap whose width and depth decrease when the angle is increased: the static angle s corresponds to the angle for which the trap disappears; the dynamical angle d to that for which the limit velocity is sufficient {{to escape from the}} trap. Finally, a continuous description of the force globally acting on the grain is proposed, which preserves this hysteretic behavior...|$|R
50|$|The {{reason the}} others were {{scrapped}} was due to maintenance as the company Schwarzkopf, who manufactured the ride, <b>stopped</b> <b>roller</b> coaster production, so the ride cars and brakes on the ride can't be fixed easily, meaning the block brakes are broken so the ride can't run multiple trains; the best-condition parts are taken from the other trains {{and put on the}} one in operation.It is also noted that Cannonball Express isn't as thrilling as it once was, and the trims do not work anymore, which are located part way through the course of the track, meaning the ride's corners can sometimes be painful.|$|R
40|$|In this study, a {{mechanical}} model {{was introduced to}} analyze the hair wrapping via a contact surface in the yarn formation zone. Worsted and ramie/cotton rovings were then used to produce yarns on an experimental ring frame with and without a delivery rubber roller to validate the theoretical analysis. Yarn properties, including hairiness, unevenness, and tensile properties were tested and {{the results indicated that}} the delivery <b>roller</b> could <b>stop</b> fibers from escaping from the twisting process in the spinning triangle and wrap most of them onto the stem of the yarn. In particular for worsted spinning, yarn unevenness CV, as well as tensile properties, was improved significantly due to an improved arrangement of the worsted strand when using the front delivery rubber roller. However, yarn evenness and tensile properties deteriorated for ramie/cotton yarn spun with a delivery rubber roller. This was mainly because of the high modulus of the ramie/cotton blend strand, as upstream twists were blocked and a weak spinning zone was formed to incur an unexpected drawing. ...|$|R
5000|$|In January 2003 Kronospan UK {{was fined}} £15,000 after admitting failure {{to ensure the}} safety of an employee. While {{removing}} waste paper from between the <b>rollers</b> of a <b>stopped</b> machine, the employee was caught as the rollers closed and the machine started up. As the rollers were operating in a reverse direction, the worker's arm was extruded toward the man, rather than his body being dragged into the machine. An investigation found that another worker who was attempting to correct a fault on the machine had pressed a button [...] "that, unknown to him or anyone else at the factory, was a delayed start button which set the machine rolling." [...] Although the machine had been in use for three years the button had never been pressed before and not even the management knew what it was for.|$|R
