5000|$|He {{was born}} on October 19, 1898, on the Otoe-Missouria {{reservation}} in Oklahoma Territory. His father, George Washington Dailey, {{was a member of}} the Eagle Clan of the Missouria and belonged to a traditionalist group within the combined Otoe-Missouria tribe called the [...] "Coyote Band." [...] As a result, Truman Dailey was well-versed in the traditional lore of his people. Dailey attended Oklahoma A&M College until 1922. While at Oklahoma A&M, Dailey performed in the college band and was made a member of Kappa Kappa Psi band fraternity. In 1928, he married Lavina Koshiway, daughter of Jonathan Koshiway, who was one of the founders of the Native American Church. By 1938, Truman and Lavina were conducting their own church services, where he was considered a <b>Road</b> <b>Man</b> (ceremonial leader). During the next decade Dailey served in administrative offices in the Native American Church of Oklahoma and the newly formed Native American Church of the United States.|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} a {{literary}} analysis of the satirical Sámi folk-song ”Elveland”. The song about about the <b>road</b> <b>man,</b> forester and river attendant Elveland {{on the west side}} of the municipality of Porsanger was made in the beginning of the 1900 s, as a form of revenge on the part of the local community because he would not let them cut as much firewood as they needed. With irony as an important device, the text serves as a meeting point for dialogues between different voices, and where power relations and the political nature of cultural identity is revealed. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{movement}} towards internationalism {{has had two}} phases: one, a purported {{reform in}} international law designed to substitute subordination for co-ordination, with a non-existent police force as the enforcer of law; and, two, the first having been frustrated, to create a super-state which shall prevail by overwhelming power against any state. This book represents the first phase. The eight chapters, which {{do not seem to}} have any relation to each other, have to a large extent appeared before in the form of periodical articles, mostly in the American Journal of International Law and Foreign Affairs. The author has been a middle of the <b>road</b> <b>man</b> heretofore, concerned with defending international law against modern innovations. In this book, however, he assumes that the innovations, principally the United Nations Charter, has or will become law in due time. As contrasted with his teachers, Mr. Jessup shows a liking for the new fashions. The League of Nations died some years ago. It is surprising that it is cited as if it still existed. The author molds international law to accommodate what he thinks he sees. He thinks he sees a community of nations which will apply the new law. The antics of Soviet Russia seem to render the supposed 2 ̆ 2 community 2 ̆ 2 a dream. The author 2 ̆ 7 s major postulates of the individual as a source and subject of international law and the interdependence of states seem belied by the event. The United Nations looks as if it is about to die. As we go to press, seventeen senators are reported to have introduced a resolution looking to the fundamental revision of UN. The Military Staff Committee seems unable to agree on a formula by which troops or a UN commission are to be sent to the countries surrounding Greece, to Palestine and to Korea to enforce the judgment of UN. It may be, of course, that Russia will step out and not stymie the whole show by her veto, but this seems unlikely and with her departure a new war is likely to begin. It is true that war is now made more difficult, but not by the Charter. War has now become so terrible that the victor is liable to suffer as much as the vanquished. That is the one ground for hope that war may abolish itself...|$|E
