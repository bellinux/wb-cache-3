40|$|Serious {{degradation}} {{is experienced}} by the external surfaces of spacecraft that operate in low earth orbits for extended periods of time, {{as a result of}} the ablative effects of atmospheric atomic oxygen, possibly catalyzed by solar ultraviolet radiation. Improved base materials and surface coatings are being developed by government, university and industry teams to combat the effects of this degradation. A small spacecraft and a suite of associated instruments, designed to measure the performance of improved, atomic-oxygen-resistant materials and coatings in orbit and to telemeter the resulting data and video images to earth at intervals during a one-year mission, have been described in a definition study sponsored by the Langley Research Center under NASA 2 ̆ 7 s In-Space Technology Experiments Program. Instruments selected for use in this miniature orbiting laboratory include a <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> a set of quartz crystal microbalances, a set of osmium-based atomic oxygen sensors, a scatterometer, a set of osmium actinometers and a scanning optical microscope.

The antenna configuration and position in a tank are important factors in coupling the antenna to the natural electromagnetic modes. In this study, different monopole and dipole antenna mounting configurations and positions were modeled and responses simulated in a full-scale tank model with the transient solver of CST Microwave Studio (CST Computer Simulation Technology of America, Inc.).

In the previous semester, we studied standard configurations of QMAs through detailed simulations, found a novel configuration of electrodes with enhanced field linearity, and started the fabrication of a conventional QMA from scratch. In this semester, we have completed the fabrication of the first prototype QMA. We have succesfully tested our electron impact ionization source, and the Faraday cup detector arrangement. We have opti-mized the low-noise detector electronics for high speed acquisition, while retaining full sensitivity. We have assembled an electronic control unit for the <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> which generates the RF and DC voltages for the quadrupole and performs an amplitude sweep to obtain the mass spectrum, while being completely controlled from the computer through the serial port. Due to insufficient level of vacuum in the chamber we have not achieved mass separation as yet, and are currently re-fabricating some of the components to improve the vacuum level. ...|$|R
40|$|A key {{requirement}} of a low-gravity screen-channel liquid acquisition device (LAD) {{is the need}} to retain 100 % liquid in the channel in response to propellant outflow and spacecraft maneuvers. The point at which a screen-channel LAD ingests vapor is known as breakdown, and can be measured several different ways such as: visual observation of bubbles in the LAD channel outflow; a sudden change in pressure drop between the propellant tank and LAD sump outlet; or, an indication by wet-dry sensors placed in the LAD channel or outflow stream. Here we describe a new type of sensor for gauging a screen-channel LAD, the <b>Radio</b> <b>Frequency</b> <b>Mass</b> Gauge (RFMG). The RFMG measures the natural electromagnetic modes of the screen-channel LAD, which is very similar to an RF waveguide, to determine the amount of propellant in the channel. By monitoring several of the RF modes, we show that the RFMG acts as a global sensor of the LAD channel propellant fill level, and enables detection of LAD breakdown {{even in the absence of}} outflow. This paper presents the theory behind the RFMG-LAD sensor, measurements and simulations of the RF modes of a LAD channel, and RFMG detection of LAD breakdown in a channel using a simulant fluid during inverted outflow and long-term stability tests...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of a broad-beam, three-grid, ion extraction system incorporating <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> (RF) <b>mass</b> discrimination was investigated experimentally. This testing demonstrated that the system, based on a modified single-stage Bennett <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer,</b> can discriminate between ionic species having about a 2 -to- 1 mass ratio while producing a broad-beam of ions with low kinetic energy (less than 15 eV). Testing was conducted using either argon and krypton ions or atomic and diatomic oxygen ions. A simple one-dimensional model, which ignores magnetic field and space-charge effects, was developed to predict the species separation capabilities {{as well as the}} kinetic energies of the extracted ions. The experimental results correlated well with the model predictions. This RF mass discrimination system can be used in applications where both atomic and diatomic ions are produced, but a beam of only one of the species is desired. An example of such an application is a 5 eV atomic oxygen source. This source would produce a beam of atomic oxygen with 5 eV kinetic energy, which would be directed onto a material specimen, to simulate the interaction between the surface of a satellite and the rarefied atmosphere encountered in low-Earth orbit...|$|R

40|$|AbstractProton {{transfer}} {{reaction of}} multiply charged ions at high mass-to-charge ratios were explored {{with a low}} <b>frequency</b> quadrupole <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer.</b> This instrument enabled a qualitative comparison of proton transfer reaction rates at low charge states for ions generated by electrospray ionization (ESI) from different solution conformations and for disulfide-linked versus disulfide-reduced protein ions. Proton transfer reactions that efficiently {{reduced the number of}} charges for ESI-generated ions to approximately the number of arginines in the polypeptide sequence were observed. No significant differences in gas-phase reaction rates were noted between different solution conformers. Differences in reaction rates between “native” and disulfide-reduced proteins were much smaller than those observed below m/z 2000 with lower proton affinity reagents or by using lower reagent concentrations. These smaller differences in reaction rates are thought to reflect the reduced electrostatic contributions from widely spaced charge sites and thus, the reduced sensitivity to an ion's three-dimensional structure or “compactness. ...|$|R

Two analysis systems offering fast and nondestructive methods of determining the elemental composition of substances, without requiring complicated sample preparation procedures, are laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (LA-ICPMS) and <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> glow discharge <b>mass</b> spectroscopy (rf-GDMS). A Cetac LSX- 200 laser system coupled to a LECO Renaissance ICPMS was utilized to analyze coal and ash samples prepared by incorporation into a lithium borate matrix to form a disk.

The Cassini Ion and Neutral <b>Mass</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (INMS) {{investigation}} {{will determine the}} mass composition and number densities of neutral species and low-energy ions in key regions of the Saturn system. The primary focus of the INMS investigation is on the composition and structure of Titan’s upper atmosphere and its interaction with Saturn’s magnetospheric plasma. Of particular interest is the high-altitude region, between 900 and 1000 km, where the methane and nitrogen photochemistry is initiated {{that leads to the}} creation of complex hydrocarbons and nitriles that may eventually precipitate onto the moon’s surface to form hydrocarbon–nitrile lakes or oceans. The investigation is also focused on the neutral and plasma environments of Saturn’s ring system and icy moons and on the identification of positive ions and neutral species in Saturn’s inner magnetosphere. Measurement of material sputtered from the satellites and the rings by magnetospheric charged particle and micrometeorite bombardment is expected to provide information about the formation of the giant neutral cloud of water molecules and water products that surrounds Saturn out to a distance of ∼ 12 planetary radii and about the genesis and evolution of the rings.

40|$|The <b>radio</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>mass</b> gauge (RFMG) is a low-gravity {{propellant}} quantity gauge {{being developed}} at NASA for possible use in long-duration space missions utilizing cryogenic propellants. As {{part of the}} RFMG technology development process, we evaluated the compatibility of the RFMG with a graphite-epoxy composite material used to construct propellant tanks. The key material property that can affect compatibility with the RFMG is the electrical conductivity. Using samples of 8552 IM 7 graphite-epoxy composite, we characterized the resistivity and reflectivity over a range of frequencies. An RF impedance analyzer was used to characterize the out-of-plane electrical properties (along the sample thickness) in the frequency range 10 to 1800 MHZ. The resistivity value at 500 MHz was 4. 8 ohm-cm. Microwave waveguide measurements of samples in the range 1. 7 2. 6 GHz, performed by inserting the samples into a WR- 430 waveguide, showed reflectivity values above 98. Together, these results suggested that a tank constructed from graphite-epoxy composite would produce good quality electromagnetic tank modes, which is needed for the RFMG. This was verified by room-temperature measurements of the electromagnetic modes of a 2. 4 m diameter tank constructed by Boeing from similar graphite-epoxy composite material. The quality factor Q of the tank electromagnetic modes, measured via RF reflection measurements from an antenna mounted in the tank, was typically in the range 400 Q 3000. The good quality modes observed in the tank indicate that the RFMG is compatible with graphite-epoxy tanks, and thus the RFMG {{could be used as}} a low-gravity propellant quantity gauge in such tanks filled with cryogenic propellants...|$|R
