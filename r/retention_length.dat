40|$|The size {{selectivity}} {{of alternative}} codends for nylon shrimp and yellow squat lobster was studied off the Chilean coast using the covered codend technique. Various mesh sizes (47 and 63 mm mesh opening) and shapes (diamond and square) in the codends were used. For both species, substituting the DM 47 codend with the DM 63 codend significantly increased 50 % <b>retention</b> <b>length</b> (l 50). The change of diamond (DM 47) to square mesh (SM 47) {{had a positive}} effect in size selectivity for nylon shrimp. For yellow squat lobster, no significant effect was observed when changing the diamond (DM 63) to square mesh (SM 63). Selectivity data were modeled by considering explanatory variables such as codend catch weight and vessel. Increases in the catch significantly reduced the l 50 for both species whereas the vessel factor was not significant. Finally, using the length at first maturity as a reference value, the authors concluded that the DM 47 codend failed to protect the immature portion of either stock, thus the DM 63 codend is recommended...|$|E
40|$|It is well {{established}} that increasing mesh number in the circumference of a diamond-mesh trawl codend can reduce size selection for round fish, whereas selection for flat fish species is unaffected. This effect has also been documented in Mediterranean trawl fisheries. In contrast, no information is available {{with regard to the}} effect of increasing mesh number in the circumference of square-mesh codends on the size selection of round fish and flat fish species. A field study was devised to bridge this gap and formulate proposals aimed at improving trawl fishery management. Size selection data were collected for a round fish species, red mullet (Mullus barbatus), and two flat fish species, Mediterranean scaldfish (Arnoglossus laterna) and solenette (Buglossidium luteum). Fishing trials were conducted in the Adriatic Sea (Central Mediterranean) using three square-mesh codends that differed only in mesh number around the circumference. Results demonstrated that increasing the number of meshes from 107 to 213 reduced the 50 % <b>retention</b> <b>length</b> (L 50) for red mullet by 2. 5 cm but did not affect size selection for the two flat fish species. In some fisheries, regulatory provisions regarding the number of meshes in the circumference should therefore be carefully considered both for diamond- and square-mesh codends...|$|E
40|$|The use of pop-up {{satellite}} archival tags (PSATs) {{allows a}} researcher to overcome limitations associated with acoustic, conventional, or AT type tags. With PSATs, both {{data collection and}} retrieval are fishery-independent. Previous research techniques have provided information on longer-term movements, migrations, and behavior patterns, {{but there is still}} a need for additional tagging studies with “second generation” tags with depth and light data and increased memory that will further define the short-duration activity patterns and habitat utilization of juvenile swordfish in the North Atlantic. PSATs have been successfully used on other large pelagic fishes, but have yet to be used on juvenile swordfish. This project will investigate four topics: the post-release survival rates of juvenile swordfish (defined as 3 ̆c 119 cm LJFL, the minimum domestic <b>retention</b> <b>length)</b> after being released from the recreational rod-and-reel fishery in the Florida Straits, habitat utilization of juvenile swordfish following release, an exploratory analysis of the effectiveness of minimum size and bag limits in the recreational swordfish fishery, characterization of catch composition and disposition of the catch and bycatch. High-resolution PSAT technology will be used to estimate the post-release survival of 20 individual juvenile swordfish captured with standard recreational fishing gear and techniques in the southeast Florida recreational swordfish fishery. These data will also be used to analyze behavioral interactions with the fishing gear, such as habitat utilization patterns. By combining the PSAT data with data from temperature-depth recorders (TDRs), additional information on swordfish interactions, such as effective fishing depths, will be assessed. Data gathered by the PSATs and TDRs will also be compared with other descriptions of swordfish behavior. This study will be a collaborative effort with the local recreational swordfish fishery, utilizing local fishermen to conduct the field work. Data from this study will aid in determining better management practices in terms of the efficacy of mandatory release of undersized fish. The data from the tags will also provide experimentally-generated estimates of recreational fishing mortality {{that can be used in}} ICCAT stock assessments. Providing more robust estimates of mortality and evaluating the size limits will aid in determining if the yield per recruit and the spawning potential ratio target values are being reached...|$|E

The Commonwealth Trawl Sector (CTS) and the Tasmanian Danish-seine fishery (TDSF) use a minimum codend mesh sizes of 90 and 70 mm, respectively. The codend mesh size should be tailored to the LML, {{which is based on}} the length of first maturity of females (M 50). This study found the length–girth relationship of N. richardsoni and P. bassensis was not significantly different. Using the covered codend method, these two species had 50 % <b>retention</b> <b>lengths</b> (L 50) of 294 ± 2 and 307 ± 3 mm, in 70 -mm and 90 -mm codends, respectively. L 50 estimates for mesh sizes from this study and others produced a curvilinear relationship: y = 120 ln(x) − 214, with an r 2 of 0. 8504. The size at maturity (M 50) for female N. richardsoni was 337 mm, which is larger than the estimate for female P. bassensis (247 mm). There is a mismatch between the estimates of L 50, the estimates of M 50 and the LMLs in each fishery, leading to suboptimal exploitation of female Platycephalus.

In the first experiment, a commercial trap net made entirely from 25 mm mesh and designed for use in shallow water was alternatively fished with a fine-meshed (9. 5 mm netting) trap net (used as a control). In the second experiment, two trap-net configurations designed for use in deeper water and comprising the same anterior section (made from 25 mm mesh), but with different bunts made from (i) the conventional 25 mm mesh and (ii) 31 mm mesh were alternately fished against the control. Both of the conventional trap nets (comprising 25 mm mesh throughout) had low amounts of bycatch and similarly selected eastern king Penaeus plebejus, greasyback Metapenaeus bennettae and school prawns Metapenaeus macleayi across narrow selection ranges (< 3. 4 mm) and at 50 % <b>retention</b> <b>lengths</b> (between 18. 53 and 21. 50 mm) that were larger than the average commercially-accepted sizes (15 - 17 mm CL).

Ten studies investigating systemic, epidural, intrathecal, intrapleural and paravertebral analgesia involving 891 patients following esophagectomy were included.

Retention of NPs is modeled based on the concept of reversible and irreversible retention, by using the laboratory scale determined parameters. Our results show that the fraction of retained NPs increases nonlinearly with the length scale of the homogeneous media. The results also show that if the heterogeneity of the medium is consistent across scales, the fraction of retained NPs would behave just like homogeneous medium. In this study, small change in heterogeneity at two outcrop scales affects the retention of NPs, suggesting that heterogeneity may significantly impact the retention behavior of NPs that may not necessarily follow the behavior predicted from homogeneous cores (or periodically heterogeneous medium) ...|$|R

The purpose of this in vitro study was to investigate the effect of length and diameter on the retentive strength of sandblasted tapered prefabricated titanium posts (Erlangen post system(R)). Posts with constant taper angle but with three different lengths (9, 12, 15 mm) and apical diameters (0. 5, 0. 9, 1. 1 mm) were cemented using zinc phosphate cement into the prepared and roughened post spaces of 90 intact anterior teeth. The post <b>retention</b> concerning <b>length</b> and diameter, being independent from each other, was measured by a tensile force test.

40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} explore how {{the character of the}} retention interval affected event-based prospective memory. According to the canons of retrospective memory, prospective per-formance should have been worse with increasing delays between intention formation and the time it was appropriate to complete an action. That result did not occur. Rather, prospective memory was better with increasing retention intervals in Experiments 1 A, IB, and 3. In manipulating the nature of the retention interval, the authors found that there were independent contributions of <b>retention</b> interval <b>length</b> and the number of intervening activities, with more activities leading to better prospective memory (Experi-ments 2 and 3). The identical retention intervals did not improve retrospective memory in Experiment 4. Theoretical explanations for these dissociations between prospective and retrospective memory are considered. In the classic studies performed by Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885 / 1964), he demonstrated that memory declines with increasing delays between study and test. By teaching himself lists of 13 syllables to a criterion of two correct recalls, he systematically varied the retention interval from 20 min to 31 days. Ebbinghaus discovered that the forgetting curve, as it is now known, was approximated by a logarithmic function with a fast initial rate of forgetting over the near term and a slower decline in forgetting as retention intervals were increased. The forgetting curve appears to be a very general property of retrospective memory because it is true of foreign language learning (Bahrick & Phelps, 1987), typing skills (Baddeley & Longman, 1978) and even cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills (McKenna & Glendon, 1985). Although there is no agreement on why this law of forgetting is so pervasive across different materials, many memory theorists favor interfer-ence accounts of retrospective forgetting over decay theories that depict memory traces as simply crumbling into parts over tim...|$|R

A trouser trawl selectivity experiment reported here gives an L 50 at 43 cm in 135 mm codend. A selectivity {{analysis of the}} gillnets using loglinear models is done, and show maximum <b>retention</b> probability for <b>lengths</b> at 40. 6 - 63. 8 cm for the five mesh-sizes used. The effect of the fishiig strategy is analysed in respect to the selectivity of the gear used and the diskibution of length and age in the catches. To avoid possible bias from strong dominating yearclasses and selection in these comparisons, length-at-age data are used. The sex-ratio in gillnet catches is {{shown to be a}} linear fiinction of meshsize. Our data show no trend in length distribution with depth. We show that calculated growth of female Greenland halibut is affected by the selectivity of the gears. It is shown that growth parameters calculated fiom gillnet catches may be biased due to the selection properties in the gillnets.

40|$|Objectives: The resin-bonded fixed partial {{dentures}} {{have gained}} immense popularity {{in recent years}} as they are more conservative, esthetic, economic and easily fabricated. However debonding is considered {{the most common cause of}} failure of resin bonded prosthesis. The objective of the study were to compare the effects of different groove lengths and thickness of retainers on retention of maxillary anterior base metal resin bonded retainers. Study Design: Twenty five metal dies of maxillary central incisor duplicated from pure typhodont teeth (maxillary left central incisors) prepared to receive retainer for resin bonded fixed partial denture having different test designs were made. Five test groups were made with each group having five specimens. Two groups were having preparation depth of 0. 5 mm and <b>retention</b> groove <b>lengths</b> of 3 mm and 5 mm. Two groups had preparation depths of 0. 3 and 0. 7 mm with no groove preparation with retainer thickness of 0. 3 and 0. 7 mm respectively. Fifth group with no groove preparation and preparation depth of 0. 5 mm was kept as control for all the groups. All the specimens were cemented using calibra (Dentsply) resin cement. Each specimen was subjected to tensile loading in vertical direction on universal testing machine (Instron 5569) at a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Results: Groups with 5 mm and 3 mm groove length recorded higher mean vertical forces when compared to the group with no groove preparation. Group with 5 mm groove length showed highest mean vertical forces. The group with 0. 7 mm retainer recorded higher mean vertical force values when compared to groups with 0. 5 mm and 0. 3 mm retainer thickness. Group with 0. 3 mm retainer thickness recorded the least mean vertical force value. Conclusion: Placement of the grooves increased the retention values almost 2 ½ times than the grooveless preparation and as the thickness of the retainers increased retention values also increased. Retention value was directly proportional to the groove length and retainer thickness...|$|R
40|$|Five hens {{were trained}} on a delayed {{matching}} to sample task. The retention intervals started at 0. 25 s and were gradually increased {{until they were}} 1 s, 2 s, 4 s and 8 s in each session. At the end of training the fifth response to the sample stimulus (red or green square) extinguished the key light and initiated one of the delays which were quasi-randomly selected. At {{the end of the}} retention interval the comparison stimuli were presented: a red and a green square. A response to the comparison stimulus that matched the sample stimulus resulted in 3 -s access to wheat. An incorrect match resulted in a 3 -s blackout. There was then an intertrial interval of 10 -s regardless of the trial outcome. Accuracy remained consistently high across all the delays. The percentage of correct responses at the 8 -s delay interval remained above 70 %. Once behaviour was stable a cue was inserted into the retention interval. The blue key with a cross on it signalled that a correct response would receive reinforcement delayed by 2. 5 -s. A yellow key with a vertical line on it signalled that a correct response would receive reinforcement immediately. It was hypothesised that signalling a delay to reinforcement would decrease response accuracy on those trials. No differences in response accuracy were found for the different cues indicating that the cue did not affect response behaviour. In the next condition the blue cue now signalled that a correct response would result in 0. 5 s access to wheat. The yellow cue now signalled a correct response would be followed by 4. 5 -s access to wheat. Accuracy for the small and large reinforcer remained the same. Through each condition matching accuracy remained between 60 and 80 % regardless of the <b>length</b> of the <b>retention</b> interval. It is thought the gradual increases in <b>retention</b> interval <b>length</b> during training may have been responsible for the maintained high accuracy...|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze the fiber <b>length</b> <b>retention</b> {{capacity}} of extrusion and injection molding processes for short and long kenaf fiber reinforced polypropylene composites. The composites were manufactured by adding maleic anhydride grafted polypropylene (MAPP) and an antioxidant (Irganox) using twin-screw extrusion and injection molding processes. A higher level of fiber attrition rate was observed during the twin-screw compounding compared to that in the injection molding. During high-temperature shear mixing, both processes caused a reduction in fiber length below the calculated critical fiber length along with considerable fiber damage. The mechanical and thermal properties of the resultant composites were subsequently characterized. Cone calorimeter tests demonstrated that the peak heat release rate for the kenaf fiber composites (30. wt. %) was reduced by 37 % compared to pure polypropylene (PP). In the UL- 94 V tests, the presence of lignin in kenaf reduced the dripping time considerably, which further led to the formation of char residue after burning. Although the fiber length obtained was below the critical fiber length under high shear processing (twin-screw compounding and injection molding), effective fiber dispersion, orientation and opening led to significantly improved mechanical performance of the PP/kenaf composites, irrespective of the initial fiber length...|$|R

40|$|The {{therapeutic}} community (TC) approach to recovery from drug abuse has gained research support for its overall effectiveness, but questions remain regarding the {{low rates of}} treatment retention. Much {{of the research on}} predictors of retention in TCs has focused on patient factors, but these yield little consistent predictive ability. This study examined the relationship between social predictors (at treatment entry) and treatment retention (i. e., the number of days retained in the program) for homeless substance abusing men residing in a TC (N= 107; mean age of 39, SD= 8. 41; 74 % African American). The following questions were examined: 1.) Do pre- treatment social predictors, like social support and 12 - Step participation, increase retention? 2.) Does an initial psychological sense of community (PSOC) increase retention in the program? 3.) Does an individual’s PSOC mediate the relationship between pre- treatment social predictors and retention? A series of logistic regressions were estimated predicting early retention and a series of Cox (survival analysis) regressions were estimated predicting the length of stay in the program. Results indicated that 12 - step involvement predicted length of stay, with those reporting greater involvement remaining in the program for fewer days, which was contrary to what was expected. PSOC also significantly predicted treatment retention, with those developing a higher initial PSOC being more likely to remain in the program, particularly through the first 45 days. However, 12 - step attendance and measures of social support did not predict either early <b>retention</b> or <b>length</b> of stay and there was no support for the hypothesized mediated model. These findings begin to illuminate the importance of social factors, particularly PSOC, in a {{therapeutic community}} where treatment retention is the goal. This is an important first step, as existing literature has neglected to identify social predictors of treatment retention within the TC. Future studies would do well to examine whether other measures of social support, like network reaction to use, for example, serve as more promising predictors of treatment retention. Similarly, research should address whether changes in these social factors over time predict retention and whether 12 - step involvement and PSOC promote retention in other populations and therapeutic contexts...|$|R
40|$|Gene {{banks have}} been {{established}} to conserve the genetic diversity of crop species. Large germplasm collections lead to management problems (space, maintenance costs, etc.), especially in collections involving species with recalcitrant seeds that must be maintained as growing plants. Core collections (CCs) are thus developed {{to reduce the size}} of large germplasm collections while keeping the maximum variability. This also facilitates fine phenotypic evaluation. In this study, several software packages (DARwin, PowerMarker and MSTRAT) and methods (Max length subtree, M strategy, simulated annealing and MinSD) were compared to define a mandarin (Citrus reticulata) CC. One hundred and sixty-seven accessions were sampled from two germplasm collections, which were genotyped with 50 SSR, 24 InDel and 68 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. All the CC obtained were tested for the maintenance of the genetic variability parameters (Ho and He) of the initial collection, the level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and the phenotypic diversity <b>retention.</b> The Max <b>length</b> subtree function from DARWin seemed to be the most appropriate method for establishing a CC in C. reticulata. It maintained 96. 82 % of the allelic richness and 17. 96 % of the size of the initial collection with only 30 accessions. Besides it did not increase the LD (r 2 value) of the initial collection and retained the vast majority of the phenotypic variability. However, a CC with 70 accessions would be more helpful for genetic association studies. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{determine}} the effect of arousal on verbal learning and subsequent memory retention at short and long retention intervals. This research attempted to delineate the issues of the model of arousal employed, the learning paradigm used, and the type of verbal material used to study verbal learning against a background of growing debate about the level of bodily arousal (activation) necessary for optimal learning (performance) in the classroom. The present study attempted to extend the generalizability of Hebb 2 ̆ 7 s inverted U function of arousal while providing detracting evidence for Walker 2 ̆ 7 s Action Decrement Hypothesis. The subjects were 45 adults ages 18 to 54. The subjects were divided into three levels of arousal, high, moderate, and low contingent upon their composite scores on the Activation-Deactiviation Adjective Check List and Eysenck 2 ̆ 7 s Personality Inventory, self-report inventories highly correlated with physiological arousal. The subjects were required to learn a list of 30 semantic verbal stimuli. The dependent variable was the number of semantic stimuli correctly recognized immediately after the learning trial and after 24 hours (long term memory). The design employed a 2 (<b>retention</b> interval <b>length)</b> x 3 (arousal level) factorial analysis. Linear and quadratic trend analyses evaluated the shape variation of the main effect of arousal level over long and short-term retention intervals. The main effect of arousal level was significant (p 3 ̆c. 05) as predicted. However, the high arousal group demonstrated superior performance over both the moderate and low arousal groups. It was predicted that the moderate arousal group would demonstrate superior performance. The linear and quadratic trend analyses revealed a significant (p 3 ̆c. 05) linear component and a non-significant curvilinear component of the main effect of arousal thus detracting from the predicted curvilinear or inverted U curve describing the relationship between arousal and learning/memory. A test of the main effect of retention interval was not significant as predicted. A test of the interaction between arousal level and retention interval was not significant. Thus Walker 2 ̆ 7 s Action Decrement Theory was not supported as it predicted an interaction between interval length and arousal. It was concluded that more than any other factor, the operational definition of arousal accounted for the variance and conflicting results in arousal, learning/memory studies...|$|R
