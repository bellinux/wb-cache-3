40|$|Abstract: In {{the past}} two decades, many noise {{reduction}} techniques {{have been developed for}} removing noise and <b>retaining</b> <b>edge</b> details in images. The process of removing noise from the original image is still a demanding problem for researchers. There have been several algorithms and each has its assumptions, merits, and demerits. The prime focus of this paper is related to the pre processing of an image before it can be used in applications. The pre processing is done by de-noising of images. In order to achieve these de-noising algorithms, filtering approach and wavelet based approach are used and performs their comparative study. Image filtering algorithms are applied on images to remove the different types of noise that are either present in the image during capturing or injected into the image during transmission. Wavelet transform and median filter are used for the image reconstruction and denoising. In this paper, we propose fast and high-quality nonlinear algorithms for denoising digital images corrupted by mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise...|$|E

Fast Generalized Fourier Transform (FGFT) is a complex, non-redundant, progressive resolution, globally referenced phase output, time-frequency representation applicable for non-stationary signals. Though {{the analysis of}} forward FGFT framework for 1 D signal is present in literature, analysis of synthesis (or reverse) FGFT framework is not available for 1 D and 2 D signals. An Image (2 D signal) synthesized using only phase {{components of}} FGFT, does not produce edge information. In the process of FGFT, Fourier Transform (FT) phase coefficients gets mingled together, thus the normalization procedure used to retain phase is ineffective to separate FT phase coefficients from FGFT samples. This thesis proposes an algorithm to effectively separate FT phase coefficients from FGFT samples and thus reconstruct image with edge information from phase-only components of FGFT samples. The amount of information present in phase and magnitude of different transforms is measured. The comparison indicates that FT retains most information than others in phase-only image reconstruction and Curvelet Transform (CT) retains most information in magnitude-only image reconstruction compared to other transforms. In contrast, FGFT <b>retains</b> <b>edge</b> information equally in both magnitude and phase components...|$|R

40|$|Based on {{a simple}} impulse detector, an {{iterative}} self-adaptive algorithm to impulsive noise filtering for color images is presented in this paper. First, a simple but effective impulse detector is used in detecting the noise pixels in color images. Then, if a pixel is detected as a corrupted one according to the impulse detector, the proposed filter will select a suitable pixel in the predefined filter window to replace it, whereas the undistorted pixels are preserved under the filtering operation. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other conventional multichannel filters in reducing impulsive noise and <b>retaining</b> <b>edges</b> and corners in color images. The distinctive advantage of our algorithm is its very simplicity but very good performance. Keywords: Self-adaptive algorithm, color image processing, impulsive noise, multichannel filters. ...|$|R

The filter, called Certainty Assisted Spatial (CAS) filter, first employs the physical constraints on motion continuity and spatial continuity to distinguish corrupted pixels (e. g., due to artifacts, random noise, or the “mixed pixels ” effect) and missing data from uncorrupted pixels in an elevation map. It then removes the corrupted pixels and missing data, while missing data is filled in by a Weighted Median filter. Uncorrupted pixels are left intact so as to <b>retain</b> <b>edges</b> of objects. Our extensive indoor and outdoor mapping experiments demonstrate that the CAS filter has better performance in erroneous data reduction and map detail preservation than existing filters...|$|R

Termed the contiguous K-average, it aggregates pixels by examining all pixels contiguous to an existing cluster and adding the pixel closest to the mean of the existing cluster. The process is iterated until K pixels were accumulated. Rather than simply compare the visual results of processing with this operator to other filters, some approaches were developed which allow quantitative evaluation of how well and filter performs. Particular attention is given to the standard deviation of noise within a feature and the stability of imagery under iterative processing. Demonstrations illustrate the performance of several filters to discriminate against noise and <b>retain</b> <b>edges,</b> the effect of filtering as a preprocessing step, and the utility of the contiguous K-average filter when used with remote sensing data...|$|R
30|$|Many common {{modalities}} {{of medical}} images acquire high-resolution and multispectral images, which are subsequently processed, visualized, and transmitted by subsampling. These subsampled images compromise resolution for processing ability, thus risking loss of significant diagnostic information. A hybrid multiresolution vector quantizer (HMVQ) {{has been developed}} exploiting the statistical characteristics of the features in a multiresolution wavelet-transformed domain. The global codebook generated by HMVQ, {{using a combination of}} multiresolution vector quantization and residual scalar encoding, <b>retains</b> <b>edge</b> information better and avoids significant blurring observed in reconstructed medical images by other well-known encoding schemes at low bit rates. Two specific image modalities, namely, X-ray radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), have been considered as examples. The ability of HMVQ in reconstructing high-fidelity images at low bit rates makes it particularly desirable for medical image encoding and fast transmission of 3 D medical images generated from multiview stereo pairs for visual communications.|$|R

40|$|International audienceImage super-resolution (SR) aims {{to recover}} {{high-resolution}} images from their low-resolution counterparts for improving image analysis and visualization. Interpolation methods, widely {{used for this}} purpose, often result in images with blurred edges and blocking effects. More advanced methods such as total variation (TV) <b>retain</b> <b>edge</b> sharpness during image recovery. However, these methods only utilize information from local neighborhoods, neglecting useful information from remote voxels. In this paper, we propose a novel image SR method that integrates both local and global information for effective image recovery. This is achieved by, in addition to TV, low-rank regularization that enables utilization of information throughout the image. The optimization problem can be solved effectively via alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Experiments on MR images of both adult and pediatric subjects demonstrate that the proposed method enhances the details in the recovered high-resolution images, and outperforms methods such as the nearest-neighbor interpolation, cubic interpolation, iterative back projection (IBP), non-local means (NLM), and TV-based up-sampling...|$|R

Thresholding generally <b>retains</b> the strongest <b>edges</b> (correlations), either by <b>retaining</b> <b>edges</b> surpassing a given absolute weight, or by constraining the edge density. The latter (more widely used) method risks inclusion of false positive edges at high edge densities and exclusion of true positive edges at low edge densities. Here we apply new wavelet-based methods, which enable construction of proabilistically-thresholded graphs controlled for type 1 error, to a dataset of resting state fMRI scans of 56 patients with schizophrenia and 71 healthy controls. By thresholding connectomes to fixed edge-specific P value, {{we found that}} functional connectomes of patients with schizophrenia were more disconnected than those of healthy controls, exhibiting a lower edge density and a higher number of (dis) connected components. Furthermore many many participants' connectomes could not be built up to the fixed edge densities commonly studied in the literature (~ 5 - 30 %) whilc controlling for type 1 error. Additionally, we showed that the topological randomisation previously reported in the schizophrenia literature is likely attributable to "non-significant" edges added when thresholding connectomes to fixed density based on correlation. Finally, by explicitly comparing connectomes thresholded by increasing P value and decreasing correlation, we showed that probabilistically thresholded connectomes show decreased randomness and increased consistency across participants.
