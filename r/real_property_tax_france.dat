This paper analyzes problems associated with locally collected <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>taxes</b> where the <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> base is only revaluated at long time intervals. Using counties in North Carolina as the subject of the analysis, we find that effective <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> rates fall between revaluations. We calculate that a system of taxing market values of <b>real</b> <b>property</b> at a constant legislated tax rate would have yielded additional annual revenues of $ 320 million for North Carolina counties over 1980 to 1995. local public finance, <b>property</b> taxation, <b>real</b> <b>property</b> revaluation, Public Economics,...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we examine {{potential}} {{consequences of the}} proposed changes to the real estate taxation in the Republic of Slovenia by comparing two municipalities. We first analyse the existing compensation for the urban land usage and <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> in Urban Municipality Kranj and Municipality Divača. We then consider factors that affect calculation and magnitude of both levies. Comparing the data on both levies from both municipalities we discuss differences between them, in particular what types of <b>property</b> the forthcoming <b>Real</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Tax</b> Act (2013) will affect most in respect {{to the amount of}} taxation. We establish that if <b>Real</b> <b>Property</b> <b>Tax</b> Act (2013) were introduced, owners of flats, houses and business <b>properties</b> would get <b>taxed</b> considerably more than previously. The only exception are owners of real estate for industrial use, most of whom would pay less tax than before. Because municipalities would become liable to <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax,</b> they would be worse off financially in the forecast period 2014 – 2016 than before when they were not liable to compensation for the urban land usage. In this period Urban Municipality Kranj would pay annually 825, 000 € in <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> and Municipality Divača 77, 000 €...|$|R

40|$|The <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> {{is local}} government's {{primary source of}} revenue, {{providing}} 48 percent of local governmental revenues nationwide. Of all local government expenditures, 37 percent go to elementary and secondary schools. Therefore, problems with <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> become problems of school finance. Taxes and subsidies generally do not change the underlying value of land, only the distribution of interists {{between public and private}} landowners. The preferential assessment of farm, open space, and forest lands represents a nearly universal program subsidy by local government to landowners. USDA findings suggest that revenue losses by new entries receiving preferential assessment are greater than the revenue gained by lands leaving preferential assessment, and that preferential assessment does not preserve agricultural land use. The <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> can be improved by levying <b>taxes</b> on <b>property</b> in proportion to value; eliminating exemptions; assessing land and capital improvements separately; appraising and assessing at 100 percent of market value; reducing the number of classes and categories of land for differential assessment or rates; eliminating caps, circuit breakers, senior preferences, and other forms of social engineering through the <b>real</b> <b>property</b> <b>tax</b> system; and incorporating appraisal and assessment activities into a comprehensive geographic information system.
