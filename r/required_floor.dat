50|$|In FTTO designs {{there is}} no need for floor distributors, and no {{investment}} in cooling, power supply and security equipment (i.e. access control, fire protection, sensors, UPS) for the floor distribution room is <b>required.</b> <b>Floor</b> distribution rooms hosting technical equipments (usually measuring 6-18 m2 each) are not required and the room saved can be used alternatively.Another advantage of FTTO infrastructures is their flexibility. New users, services or applications can be easily accommodated into the network. Moreover, network adjustments, upgrades and physical changes are seamlessly integrated into the existing network without operation stops. Also, FTTO installations can be realised on average by 60% quicker than their traditional counterparts. Research shows that using EEE-enabled switches can save up to 70% power consumption compared to traditional non-EEE network designs.. On top of that, most advanced FTTO infrastructures help to save up to 40% TCO.|$|E

40|$|Modelling and {{optimisation}} of the under-floor {{heating system}} (UFHS) with Pex pipes are studied in this paper. For modelling the system, two regions were considered. The {{first one was}} the over-floor region which included room air and walls. This region was considered as one control volume and the system of non-linear energy equations for room air and walls were solved using Newton–Raphson method. The second or under-floor region included heating pipes, concrete and floor finish. This region was modelled using finite volume method. For optimising the UFHS, an objective function (sum of investment and operating costs of UFHS) was proposed and type and thickness of the floor finish, velocity of hot water passing through the pipe, concrete thickness and pipe diameter, were considered as the decision variables (design parameters). The sensitivity analysis showed 19. 8 %, 10. 5 %, 2. 8 % and 0. 3 % increase in the objective function with the deviation of the four above-mentioned design parameters from their optimum values (floor finish from tile to marble, water velocity from 1. 5 to 2. 5 m/s, concrete thickness from 6 to 8 cm and pipe diameter from to g in.). Finally, with the decrease in external temperature from 108 C to 208 C, the objective function increased by 21. 7 % and the <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> heat flux increased by 33. 1 %. Increasing the insulation thickness from 2. 5 to 7 cm also decreased the objective function by 20. 5 % and decreased the <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> heat flux by 38. 5 %. Practical application: A new and fast combined numerical and analytical procedure for thermal modelling of UFHS was proposed in this paper. By applying the proposed modelling procedure, the optimum values of UHFS design parameters for reaching the system lowest cost were obtained. The variation of total cost with deviation of design parameters from their optimum values was investigated. The effects of change in atmospheric temperature and wall insulation thickness on building thermal load and the total cost were studied.

40|$|In modern {{production}} and distribution systems, the automated storage/retrieval systems (AS/RS), high-storage level systems that reduce labor cost, <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> space and error rate, while increasing product availability, {{have been widely used}} since the 1950 s. Due to the high-investment costs involved in the development of high-efficient and high-flexible automated storage systems, performance estimation of the systems is both practically and theoretically important. The authors suggest a new method to estimate the travel time of a recently emerging version of AS/RSs, the multi-shuttle systems. The proposal is based on an industrial standard established by the Federation Europeenne de la Manutention (F. E. M.). In order to estimate travel times, the authors conduct a Monte Carlo simulation to determine coordinates of two additional representative points which are not given by F. E. M. Then they conduct a new Monte Carlo simulation to compare the results obtained by the method they proposed with those of previous methods and models developed in scientific literature based on Bozer and White formulations.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{proof of concept}} study into a computational strategy for reusing structural stadium elements. The strategy goal is overcoming the reuse design strain through implementation of a genetic algorithm. This algorithm is calibrated {{to search for a}} structural frame configuration, while using a reusable element set, meeting floor space requirements and following the building mass shape. The most important benefit of the algorithm implementation is its method of scouting the solution space. It accelerates the design process and presents the results in a transparent manner. These strategy aspects reduce the complications of reuse design and support the goal of encouraging the application of reuse design in practice. This will lead to a more sustainable construction industry. The algorithm has been applied on the Al Wakrah stadium for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. In this project the developer aims to deconstruct the second ring after the tournament. The presented strategy resulted in four unique structural frames, which use 100 % of the reusable structural elements, while deviating 1 % from the <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> space and 3 % from the given building mass.

50|$|While most {{buildings}} have mechanical rooms, typically in the basement, tall buildings <b>require</b> dedicated <b>floors</b> throughout the structure for this purpose, {{for a variety}} of reasons discussed below. Because they use up valuable floor area (just like elevator shafts), engineers try to minimize the number of mechanical floors while allowing for sufficient redundancy in the services they provide. As a rule of thumb, skyscrapers <b>require</b> a mechanical <b>floor</b> for every 10 tenant floors (10%) although this percentage can vary widely (see examples below). In some buildings they are clustered in groups that divide the building into blocks, in others they are spread evenly through the structure, while in others still they are mostly concentrated at the top.|$|R
40|$|Since 1995 {{container}} traffic worldwide {{has increased by}} at least 10 percent every year and this growth rate is expected to continue. There {{is an increase in}} the number of container ships as well as in ship size. In 2006, the world's largest containership, the Emma Maersk, with a length of 397 m and a width of 56 m, was commissioned. Ships like this, with load capacities of much more than 10, 000 TEU (Twenty Foot Equivalent Units), call for efficient container handling and storage systems at dedicated terminals. As a direct result, new container terminals all over the world are under construction, both on newly created port areas and in re-designation or extension of existing port areas. Besides size and load capacity of the design vessel the choice of container handling and storage system is of major influence on terminal design. These systems affect the <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> space for transport and storage of containers as well as the handling efficiency, the required number of staff, the system reliability and the operation time. The paper presents recent developments in container handling and stocking systems focusing on the amount of floor space required, and productivity. I...|$|E
40|$|CAVE {{systems are}} an {{immersive}} environment that surrounds {{one or more}} viewers with multiple large screens, which portray a virtual 3 D environment. CAVEs use generally between three and six sides and are thus effectively permanent installations, due to the <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> and room space. We describe TIVS, the Temporary Immersive Virtual environment at Simon Fraser University, a system whose defining feature {{is that it does}} not consume any permanent floor space. Yet, TIVS can be in operation in less than a minute. Viewers sit on swivel chairs in the center of an 8 ' × 6 ' space, where TIVS's frame is mounted onto the ceiling. The bottom of said frame is 7 ' above the ground, making it easy for people to walk below it. The screens mounted on the frame are rolled down whenever the system is being used and are otherwise stowed away. That frees the floor space for other uses when the system is not in use. The projection geometry ensures that people sitting in the center area of the space do not cast shadows onto the screens. A tracking system attached to the frame provides for head tracking. Overall, the non-permanent nature of the system makes it surprisingly easy to integrate Virtual Reality into everyday environments...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{light bulbs}} (e. g. Incandescent, Fluorescent) use too much electricity, convert very little energy into light of {{sufficient}} quality, {{and in their}} production use toxic contaminants. During {{the last few years}} a new type of light source, LED (Light Emitting Diode) bulb, has gained increasing popularity and its costs are set to plunge even further. LED bulbs offer many advantages over traditional sources, and they {{can be used as a}} direct replacement to existing lighting. This paper will use a spreadsheet-based analysis with hourly solar data supplied by Ecotect to show that the efficiency of LED installations can be increased when used in conjunction with Photovoltaic (PV) modules, as the two generate (and use) direct-current (DC) electricity, thereby eliminating intermediate-level losses in the electronic circuitry. If a storage battery is included, the PV generates electricity during the times when the occupants are not necessarily using the lighting, but the stored electricity can be used to power the lighting when the energy is required. The latest results demonstrate that a slight reduction in the <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> area to be lit allows the Solar-Battery-LED system to be implemented in small buildings using a storage battery size that is within the range of present commercial devices. Further, a future projection shows that by 2050, the payback time is expected to reduce to less than one third of what it is in 2013...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{determine}} the factors affecting the transformation of user requirements for a single family detached house by analyzing changing technology and life-styles of the traditional and modern house and to use these factors as guidelines for alternative building systems. Chapter 1 gives an overview of trends in housing construction and describes the user requirement profile with <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> area for each life stage. In Chapter 2, the underlying ideas of house, family and home in Japanese culture are analyzed to determine the factors which influence housing design and the way the Japanese live. Specific changes in life-style and housing design were analyzed in order to clarify certain issues which affect residential design. In Chapter 3, alternative performance statements are determined, based on changing life-styles. Chapter 4 briefly describes the four-stage development of housing industry technology after WWII. In Chapter 5, typical house plans of three selected development stages are compared and analyzed with regard to changes in technology. Principal transformation factors are derived from this analysis. Finally, projected trends assessing the future of building systems in Japan are discussed in the conclusion. by Yoshiko Ryu. Thesis (M. Arch.)

40|$|Self-balancing robots {{are unique}} mobile {{platforms}} that stay upright on two wheels using a closed-loop control system. They {{can turn on}} the spot using differential steering and have compact form factors that limit their <b>required</b> <b>floor</b> space. However they have major limitations keeping them from being used in real world applications: they cannot stand-up on their own, climb stairs, or overcome obstacles. They can fall easily if hit or going onto a slippery surface because they rely on friction for balancing. The {{first part of this}} research proposes a novel design to address the above mentioned issues related to stair-climbing, standing-up, and obstacles. A single revolute joint is added to the centre of a four-wheel drive robot onto which an arm is attached, allowing the robot to successfully climb stairs and stand-up on its own from a single motion. A model and simulation of the balancing and stair-climbing process are derived, and compared against experimental results with a custom robot prototype. The second part, a control system for an inverted pendulum equipped with a gyroscopic mechanism, was investigated for integration into self-balancing robots. It improves disturbance rejection during balance, and keeps equilibrium on slippery surfaces. The model of a gyroscope mounted onto an actuated gimbal was derived and simulated. To prove the concept worked, a custom-built platform showed it is possible for a balancing robot to stay upright with zero traction under the wheels...|$|E

Increase in building heights with certain setbacks resulted increase in possibilities of change in natural indoor lighting at the lower level of the structures.
