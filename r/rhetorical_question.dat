5|$|Starting with a <b>rhetorical</b> <b>question</b> – Is NATO losing and the Taliban winning? – Amrullah Saleh {{discusses}} the uncertainty among the Afghans about 2014 – when NATO ends its combat mission in Afghanistan. He then mentions Afghans’ {{perception that the}} US is funding {{both sides of the}} conflict because Pakistan remains the key country supporting the insurgency. Amrullah Saleh also discusses why the NATO and the US remain unwilling to confront Pakistan because of their own security concerns. He advocates for a surge in the capacity of the Afghan National Security Forces. Amrullah Saleh highlights the importance of both training and equipment to ensure that cleared areas of Afghanistan are held, communication lines are kept open, and major population centers are defended.|$|E

25|$|The <b>rhetorical</b> <b>question</b> mark or percontation {{point was}} invented by Henry Denham in the 1580s and was used {{at the end of}} a rhetorical question; however, its use died out in the 17th century. It was later revived in modern-day society by Matt DiRoberto. It was the reverse of an {{ordinary}} question mark, so that instead of the main opening pointing back into the sentence, it opened away from it. This character can be represented using the reversed question mark (⸮) found in Unicode as U+2E2E. The percontation point is analogous to the Irony mark, but these are very rarely seen.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rhetorical</b> <b>questions,</b> {{and other}} {{varieties}} of pragmatically conditioned questions, present {{a challenge for}} a purely truth-conditional theory of the interpretation of interrogatives. In this paper, {{it is argued that}} relevance-theoretic principles account for the conditions of use of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions.</b> Concretely, it is proposed that a pragmatic principle, the "Bottom of Scale Principle", critically interacts with the Principle of Relevance and derives the dynamic meaning of the rhetorical use of a question. The Bottom of Scale Principle is also associated with the particular entailment and monotonicity properties of interrogatives, which explain the ability of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> to license negative polarity items...|$|R

500|$|Charles Boner was {{the first}} to {{translate}} [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] into English, working from a German translation that had increased Andersen's lone pea to a trio of peas in an attempt to make the story more credible, an embellishment also added by another early English translator, Caroline Peachey. [...] Boner's translation was published as [...] "The Princess on the Peas" [...] in A Danish Story-Book in 1846. [...] Boner has been accused of missing the satire of the tale by ending with the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Now was not that a lady of exquisite feeling?" [...] rather than Andersen's joke of the pea being placed in the Royal Museum. Boner and Peachey's work established the standard for English translations of the fairy tales, which, for almost a century, as Wullschlager notes, [...] "continued to range from the inadequate to the abysmal".|$|E

He defended the trial court's decision, which he felt was sufficient for a guilty verdict. He summarized points of the state's case against Frank that [...] "any reasonable person" [...] would accept and said of Conley that [...] "It is hard to conceive that any man's power of fabrication of minute details could reach that which Conley showed, unless it be the truth." [...] After having made these points, Slaton's narrative changed course and asked the <b>rhetorical</b> <b>question,</b> [...] "Did Conley speak the truth?" [...] Leonard Dinnerstein wrote, [...] "Slaton based his opinions primarily upon the inconsistencies he had discovered in the narrative of Jim Conley." [...] Two factors stood out to Slaton: the transporting {{of the body to}} the basement and the murder notes.|$|E

[...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide wrote [...] "Lisa-based shows definitely fall into the hit or miss category, and “Ten” stays within those confines." [...] While he praised some of Homer's scenes, including [...] "his drunken versions of pop songs," [...] he maintained that [...] "not much else connects." [...] He concluded his review by writing [...] "Though we find the occasional laugh, the overall impact remains lackluster."

[...] From the second verse and onwards, the song finds Beyoncé [...] "vocalizing an internal battle, alternately desperate and calm", as stated by Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle. She starts to sing in a double voice; her lower vocal notes are set as the song's base, while her voice in a heightened key is played over it. In the second verse, she sings, [...] "The words don’t ever seem to come out right / But I still mean em", pining for her ex-love interest and feeling self-conscious for doing so, [...] "It hurts my pride {{to tell you how}} I feel, but I still need to" [...] before asking again, [...] "Why is that?".

500|$|Nixon {{stated that}} no {{contributor}} to the fund got any service that an ordinary constituent would not have received, and then anticipated the skeptical questions, [...] "Well, what did you use the fund for, Senator? Why {{did you have to}} have it?" [...] In response to his <b>rhetorical</b> <b>question,</b> he explained salary and office allowances for senators. He went through different ways that political expenses could be met. One way was to be rich, but the senator stated that he was not rich. Another way was to put one's spouse on the Congressional office payroll, as, he stated, his Democratic rival, Senator John Sparkman, had done. Nixon did not feel comfortable doing that himself with so many deserving stenographers in Washington needing work, though Pat Nixon was a [...] "wonderful stenographer" [...] and sometimes helped out in the office as a volunteer. At this point, the camera turned from Nixon {{for the first time to}} reveal Pat Nixon sitting alongside the desk. The senator indicated he could not continue his law practice, as some Congressmen did, due to the distance to California, and in any event he felt that practicing law while a lawmaker was a conflict of interest. Thus, he indicated, he had found that the best way to pay for political expenses not within his means was to allow contributors to do so. Nixon proffered the legal and accounting opinions as proof of his statements.|$|E

40|$|Standard {{analyses}} associate <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> {{with negative}} singleton answers, but I introduce new data (including Switchboard corpus data) with <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> {{that have a}} wider range of answers: (1) Negative answer Who lifted a finger to help? (2) Positive answer Has the educational system been so watered down that anybody who' s above average is now gifted? (3) Non-null answer Who always shows up late to class? (4) Multiple answers What’s going to happen to these kids when they grow up? I propose a new condition for felicitous use of rhetorical questions: the Speaker and Addressee must share prior commitments to similar and obvious answers. I frame the analysis of shared answers within Gunlogson's (2001) model of Common Ground, and I define sufficiently similar answers as those that either have an identical value or share an extreme position on a contextually relevant scale. Obviousness is measured using van Rooy's (2003) implementation of entropy for calculating the predictability of an answer set. Because they invoke an answer set, <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> resemble interrogatives, but the obviousness of a particular answer implies the bias of an assertion. As such, they are assertive, yet uninformative: instead of informing any discourse participant, <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> are redundant and serve to synchronize Speaker and Addressee beliefs...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} prosody of <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> in German. In an {{interaction}} study we examined how speakers use boundary tones, pitch, duration and voice quality to mark syntactically ambiguous <b>questions</b> as <b>rhetorical</b> or information-seeking. To this end, speakers produced identical interrogatives (polar and wh-questions) in rhetorical and information-seeking contexts. The results show that, phonologically, <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> end in low boundary tones more often, {{but the difference}} is minimal (5 %), especially compared {{to the effect of}} interrogative type on boundary tones (polar questions are rising and wh-questions are falling in more than 90 % of the cases, respectively). Phonetically, <b>rhetorical</b> <b>questions</b> are characterized by longer utterance durations and lower initial pitch. Furthermore, the first constituent (wh-word or verb) is produced with a softer voice compared to information-seeking questions. Overall the results show that there are prosodic differences between RQs and ISQs for both polar and wh-questions. There seems to be a tendency for rhetoricity to be signalled early-on in the utterance in both polar and wh-questions. Furthermore, the phonetic cues for disambiguation are stronger in wh-questions than in polar questions...|$|R
