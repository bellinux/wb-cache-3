5|$|It's a {{very passionate}} song. It's really, I think maybe, the most passionate {{one on the}} record. I mean, I'm <b>really</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it because that's really one that goes {{over-the-top}} {{in the sense that}} it's got images - it has religious imagery of resurrection, it's got images of fertility and rebirth, it has really very good sexual images, images of cars - which I always like.|$|E
5|$|I think, {{and this}} is now with some {{distance}} in listening to the records, but {{on the outside looking}} in with all earnestness I think Soundgarden made the best records out of that scene. I think we were the most daring and experimental and genre-pushing really and I'm <b>really</b> <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> it. And I guess that's why I have trepidation about the idea of re-forming. I don't know what it would mean, or I guess I just have this image of who we were and I had probably a lot of anxiety during the period of being Soundgarden, as we all did, that it was responsibility and it was an important band and music and we didn't want to mess it up and we managed to not, which I feel is a great achievement.|$|E

500|$|Co-creator and {{executive}} producer Michael Piller called the casting of Eisenberg a [...] "big mistake".

[...] Fellow co-creator {{and executive}} producer Jeri Taylor echoed Piller's sentiments saying that though Eisenberg was the best actor that auditioned for the part, he was too recognizable as Nog and distracted the viewers.

He recalled with exasperating perplexity her clear, matter-of-fact tone as she talked about love-making being unconvincing. He was <b>really</b> very <b>proud</b> <b>of</b> her, and extraordinarily angry and resentful at the innocent and audacious self-reliance that seemed to intimate her sense of absolute independence of him, her absolute security without him.

As for her approach to the role of Anna, Bell enthused that she had [...] "dreamed of being in a Disney animated film" [...] since she was four years old, saying, [...] "I always loved Disney animation, {{but there was something about}} the females that was unattainable to me.
