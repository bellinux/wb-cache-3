5|$|In June {{he joined}} No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire, {{equipped}} with the Sopwith Pup. He undertook a <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> but his tenure there was unremarkable. He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols. He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols. He encountered the enemy six times but could not score. Finally on 21 and 26 July he shot down one Albatros D.V fighter for his 6–7th aerial victories.|$|E

In March 1944, after about five months' convalescence, he was passed fit for flying. He turned down the offer of a posting home to Southern Rhodesia as an instructor and, after a <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> in Egypt, travelled to Corsica to rejoin No. 237 Squadron, which was by now flying Spitfire Mk IXs.|$|E
5|$|In 1947 {{the ship}} was sold to the South African Navy, {{together}} with her sister ship, Rosamund, and departed England on 22 November after a <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> at the minesweeping school at HMS Lochinvar, Port Edgar, Scotland. The sisters arrived at Cape Town on 24 December, making stops at Gibraltar, Freetown and Walvis Bay en route. She was rechristened by {{the mayor of the}} city, A. E. Hirst, on 21 January 1948. The navy had originally intended to rename the ship Maritzburg, but decided to use the city's full name after protests. In November of that year, the sisters exercised with the British 3rd Aircraft Carrier Squadron. Later that month, together with the frigate , they visited ports in Portuguese Mozambique, returning to Durban on 12 December. While serving as a midshipmans' training ship, Pietermaritzburg became the largest South African warship to visit Knysna in September 1953. The ship and her sister were placed in reserve for a time in the late 1950s.|$|E

500|$|As well as {{operational}} conversion, No.2 OCU conducts {{refresher courses}} and fighter combat instructor courses on the Hornet. Pilots {{who have not}} flown Hornets for more than nine months undertake the two-week <b>refresher</b> <b>course.</b> Fighter combat instructor courses run for five months and are given every two years. Students are chosen from among the most experienced Hornet squadron pilots and undergo instruction in how to train others, {{as well as how}} to deal with complex operational scenarios. This is tested in simulated combat with other types of US or RAAF aircraft, as available, including F-15 Eagles, F-16 Fighting Falcons, and F/A-18 Super Hornets. Graduates become qualified F/A-18 instructors and initially remain with No.2 OCU for the next two-year cycle.

500|$|Browning {{was granted}} the {{substantive}} rank of captain on 24 November 1920. He retained his post as adjutant until November 1921, {{when he was}} posted to the Guards' Depot in Caterham. In 1924 he was posted to Sandhurst as adjutant. He was the first adjutant, during the Sovereign's Parade of 1926, to ride his horse (named [...] "The Vicar") up the steps of Old College and to dismount in the Grand Entrance. There is no satisfactory explanation {{as to why he}} did it. After the Second World War this became an enduring tradition, but since horses have great difficulty going down steps, a ramp is now provided for the horse to return. Other members of staff at Sandhurst at the time included Richard O'Connor, Miles Dempsey, Douglas Gracey, and Eric Dorman-Smith, with whom he became close friends. Browning relinquished the appointment of adjutant at Sandhurst on 28 April 1928, and was promoted to major on 22 May 1928.

500|$|It {{was well}} known to British {{servicemen}} that spending three months or more missing behind enemy lines resulted in an automatic posting back home, which Smith did not want; he was therefore wary as he entered his interview at the Naples transit base. When passage back to Rhodesia via Egypt was offered, Smith successfully requested permission to go to Britain instead, {{saying that he had}} many relatives there and considered it a second home. In England he was posted to a six-week <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> in Shropshire, flying Spitfires. Smith performed very strongly in the exercises and, at his own request, was posted back to active service after only three weeks in the course. He was attached to No. 130 (Punjab) Squadron, part of No. 125 Wing, which was commanded by Group Captain (later Air Vice Marshal) Johnnie Johnson, {{one of the most successful}} RAF flying aces of the war. Reporting for duty with No. 130 Squadron at Celle, in western Germany, on 23 April 1945, he flew combat missions there, [...] " [...] a little bit of fun shooting up odd things", he recalled, until the European war ended on 7 May with Germany's surrender.|$|E

On 7February 1925, he flew the first scheduled passenger service from Cloncurry to Camooweal, extending the airline's founding [...] route—from Charleville to Cloncurry—by [...] The following year, he completed a <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> at Central Flying School, Point Cook. On a rain-soaked McKinlay airfield near Cloncurry on 27February 1927, he flipped Qantas' first de Havilland DH.50 on to its back while attempting take-off, though he managed to escape without injury. Qantas founder Hudson Fysh berated him for a [...] "serious error of judgement", but noted his excellent three-year record as a pilot; the aircraft was soon repaired and operational again. [...] The next month, Brain became Chief Instructor at the Qantas Flying School in Brisbane, doubling as manager of the airline's local office. By mid-1928, he had overworked himself to the extent that he was ordered to take respite by Fysh; this [...] "respite" [...] nevertheless involved a 13-week trip to England to study aviation developments.|$|E
500|$|Returning to Australia in November 1949, Evans {{was posted}} to Central Flying School (CFS) at RAAF Base East Sale, Victoria, where he {{qualified}} as a flying instructor. He served in this capacity {{for the next}} four years, including an exchange posting with the Royal New Zealand Air Force from May 1951 to July 1953. As he was preparing to depart New Zealand, he received word that his next posting would be to the Korean War as a pilot with No.77 Squadron; the armistice prevented this and he returned to No.38 Squadron as an instructor. In 1954 he was assigned to transporting VIPs, serving with the Governor-General's Flight (later No.34 (Special Transport) Squadron} until 1956. As well as Governor-General Sir William Slim and Lady Slim, his passengers included Prime Minister Robert Menzies and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. Promoted to squadron leader, Evans' service with the VIP flight earned him the Air Force Cross in the Queen's Birthday Honours promulgated in the London Gazette on 13June 1957. The same year, he attended RAAF Staff College at Point Cook, Victoria. He became personal staff officer to the Minister for Air in 1958, a position he found valuable for the insight he gained into Australia's political culture. In November 1959, he took a <b>refresher</b> <b>course</b> at CFS, qualifying on De Havilland Vampire and English Electric Canberra jets. He underwent further training on Canberra bombers with No.1 Operational Conversion Unit at RAAF Base Amberley, Queensland, graduating in May 1960. From then until 1962 he served as a flight commander in No.2 Squadron, operating Canberras out of RAAF Base Butterworth, Malaysia. He subsequently attended the RAF College of Air Warfare. In January 1963, Evans was transferred to Air Staff Division, Canberra, where he helped formulate operational requirements for a new RAAF bomber. His final specification included a payload of , speed of Mach2, and range of [...] This requirement was met by the General Dynamics F-111C, 24 of which were ordered by the Australian government in October 1963. As an interim measure until delivery of the F-111, the US government offered 24 Boeing B-47 Stratojets to the RAAF. Though the offer was never seriously considered, a B-47 was test flown from Amberley to Darwin in November 1963 by the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Val Hancock, with Evans as passenger. Evans had been assigned to fly the plane but was replaced at the last moment by Hancock; the take-off almost ended in disaster after Hancock unknowingly switched off the engines' water injection—needed to ensure sufficient thrust in hot conditions—that Evans had switched on before vacating the pilot's seat. In January 1965, Evans was posted to Washington, DC, as Assistant Air Attaché, having [...] "had quite enough of writing Air Staff Requirements".|$|E
