Pre-indented inner ring raceways in roller and ball bearings were extensively endurance tested. It is observed that spalls originated from indentations in ball bearings develop initially at {{the trailing edge of}} a pre-indented raceway with a typical V-shaped spall. In this location, the raceway material first detaches {{at the edge of the}} dent, forming a V-shaped damaged area, before growing at fast rate along the raceway. Roller bearings, however, follow the well-known behavior of slowly growing the spall directly across the raceway, before continuing along the <b>rolling</b> <b>path.</b> An existing physically based rolling contact fatigue model able to predict (1) material particle detachment by surface rolling contact fatigue and (2) the effect of the elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) in such a process is adapted and used to simulate the surface damage growth in the two rolling bearing configurations.

40|$|The Z- 2 is a {{candidate}} for NASA's next generation spacesuit, designed for a range of possible missions with enhanced mobility for spacewalks both on planetary surfaces and in microgravity. Increased mobility was accomplished through innovations in shoulder and hip joints, using a number of new bearings to allow spacesuit wearers to dip, walk, and bend with ease; all important tasks for a planetary explorer collecting samples or traveling over rough terrain. The Advanced Spacesuit Development Team of NASA Johnson Space Center requested that the NASA White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) perform a series failure simulation tests on three titanium bearing assemblies, an elemental part of the joint construction used in new spacesuit designs. This testing simulated two undetected failures within the bearings and as a result the objective of this test program was to evaluate whether a failed or failing bearing could result in ignition of the titanium race material due to friction. The first failure was an inner seal leak sufficient to pressurize the race with + 99 percent oxygen. The second failure was an improperly installed or mismatched ball port that created a protrusion in the ball bearing race, partially obstructing the nominal <b>rolling</b> <b>path</b> of each ball bearing. When the spacesuit bearings are assembled, bearing balls are loaded into the assembly via a ball port. The ball port is specific and unique to each bearing assembly (matched pair). The simulated mismatched ball port is a significant source of friction, which would be caused by an assembly error. To evaluate this risk, the bearings were cycled in a simulated worst-case scenario environment, with operational loads, and potential flaw conditions. During test the amount of actuation torque required and heat generated through continuous operation were measured and the bearings were observed for sparks or burning events.

40|$|Fuel {{cladding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} critical components of nuclear reactors; so it is important to improve our understanding of various properties and behaviors of the cladding under different conditions approximating the nuclear reactor environment. Moreover, the efficiency of energy production, in addition to safety concerns, has resulted in progressive improvement of nuclear reactors design from Generation I to Generation IV. To complement this progressive trend, materials used for fuel cladding need to be improved or new materials should be developed. In this thesis, I address problems in the improvement of present fuel cladding and also investigate fuel cladding materials to be used in future Generation IV nuclear reactors. In the case of current Zircaloy- 4 fuel claddings, a detailed evaluation of the surface roughness effects on their performance and properties of Zircaloy- 4 fuel claddings was studied. A smoother surface on Zircaloy- 4 cladding tubes is demanded by the customers; however no systematic study is available addressing the effect of surface roughness on the claddings’ performance. Thus the effects of surface roughness on texture, oxidation, hydriding behaviors and mechanical properties of Zircaloy- 4 cladding tubes were investigated using various methods. It was found that surface roughness has some effects on the oxidation of Zircaloy- 4. Increasing the surface roughness would increase the weight gain, however, this effect was more pronounced at the initial oxidation stages. Synchrotron techniques were used to characterize the electronic structure of zirconium alloys in their oxidized and hydrided states. With this approach, complex interactions between hydrogen and oxygen in the zirconium matrix could be investigated, which could not be resolved using conventional methods. As a candidate for future fuel cladding material, Incoloy 800 H/HT, which is expected to be considered in super-critical water-cooled Gen IV reactors, was studied in order to optimize microstructure, texture and grain boundary characteristics. A specific Thermo-Mechanical Processing (TMP) was employed to manipulate the texture, microstructure and grain boundary character distribution. The deformation and annealing textures of thermo-mechanically processed samples were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction and orientation imaging microscopy. It was found that different <b>rolling</b> <b>paths</b> lead to different textures. The origin of different textures in differently (unidirectional and cross) rolled Incoloy 800 H/HT at high deformation strains were investigated. In addition, the recrystallization kinetic of differently rolled samples was studied. It was found that the oriented nucleation plays an important role in determining the recrystallization texture. Unidirectional rolled samples exhibited a faster recrystallization kinetic compared with cross rolled ones, due to the presence of γ-fibre. The effect of the aforementioned microstructural parameters (grain size, texture and GBCD) on the oxidation resistance of Incoloy 800 H/HT in super-critical water was investigated. It was found that the oxidation resistance of Incoloy 800 H/HT can be improved by TMP. The optimum TMP process for enhancing the oxidation resistance was proposed. Microstructural parameters that can improve the oxidation resistance of Incoloy 800 H/HT were identified. These findings will contribute to the effective selection of fuel cladding material for application in Gen IV SCW reactors...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear {{power systems}} have been under {{continuous}} development since the first nuclear power plant started operation in 1954. They are categorized into different generations, with each new generation having significant technological advances over the previous one. The worldwide effort to develop {{the next generation of}} nuclear reactors was defined at the Generation IV International Forum (GIF) in 2000. Six types of design were proposed, including supercritical water cooled reactor (SCWR). Materials in this reactor will be exposed to more severe environments than the current generation of reactors to assure higher efficiency in energy production and the current materials used for fuel cladding need to be improved or new materials should be developed. In this thesis, the behavior of two existing nuclear materials, stainless steels 310 S and 316 L was investigated, under conditions approximating the nuclear reactor environment. An environment with dynamic loop of supercritical water (SCW) was used to test the performance of the alloys and the oxides formed were analyzed. Oxidation of the alloys in air was also performed for comparison. It was found that although both alloys showed good oxidation resistance in air at 600 ºC, stainless steel 310 S has better resistance in SCW environment compared to stainless steel 316 L. A thin protective oxide layer of Mn 2 CrO 4 spinel delays oxidation in alloy 310 S. In order to improve the oxidation resistance of 310 S and 316 L stainless steels, thermo-mechanical processing (TMP) was applied to modify their microstructures. The deformation and annealing texture of the as-received and processed samples were investigated by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and orientation imaging microscopy (OIM). Different <b>rolling</b> <b>paths</b> and different deformation levels before annealing were used to produce samples of different grain size with similar texture and samples of similar grain size with different textures. Subsequently, the oxidation resistance of thermo-mechanically processed 316 L and 310 S samples in SCW was studied. It was found that the oxidation resistance of stainless steels 316 L and 310 S can be improved up to four and five times, respectively, by decreasing the grain size below a critical value of 3 µm. It was demonstrated that samples with smaller grain size provided higher fraction of grain boundaries for fast diffusion of chromium to reach the surface and compensate losses due to dissolution of chromium in the oxidation media. External oxide layers formed on as-received and thermo-mechanically processed stainless steel 316 L samples was characterized to establish possible correlation between orientation of the substrate and oxide grains. Micro and macro textures of the substrate and the oxide layers were examined and the results showed that the texture of substrate did not affect the texture of magnetite (Fe 3 O 4) in the upper oxide layer. In addition, the texture of magnetite did not affect the texture of hematite (Fe 2 O 3) on samples where hematite was an additional oxide phase. The strong texture of both oxides was explained with surface free energy minimization and strain energy minimization theory. This means that the texture of both oxides is dictated by a competition between their surface and strain energies...|$|R
40|$|Local line rolling forming is {{a common}} forming {{approach}} for the complex curvature plate of ships. However, the processing mode based on artificial experience is still applied at present, because {{it is difficult to}} integrally determine relational data for the forming shape, processing path, and process parameters used to drive automation equipment. Numerical simulation is currently the major approach for generating such complex relational data. Therefore, a highly precise and effective numerical computation method becomes crucial {{in the development of the}} automated local line rolling forming system for producing complex curvature plates used in ships. In this study, a three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element method was first employed to perform numerical computations for local line rolling forming, and the corresponding deformation and strain distribution features were acquired. In addition, according to the characteristics of strain distributions, a simplified deformation simulation method, based on the deformation obtained by applying strain was presented. Compared to the results of the three-dimensional elastoplastic finite element method, this simplified deformation simulation method was verified to provide high computational accuracy, and this could result in a substantial reduction in calculation time. Thus, the application of the simplified deformation simulation method was further explored in the case of multiple <b>rolling</b> loading <b>paths.</b> Moreover, it was also utilized to calculate the local line rolling forming for the typical complex curvature plate of ships.

These results provide a useful standpoint for designers of such systems, who wish to achieve the desired properties in reduced space, which is a common requirement in modern applications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explores the}} {{properties}} of a precessing rotor or a coupled system of precessing rotors (gyroscopes), where a special chaotic behavior in the precession angle can be found if the change of rotor angular velocity is linearly coupled by (an) holonomy to the precession angular velocity and angle. The linear coupling provides for <b>rolling</b> cone <b>paths</b> and allows spinning up and controlling the rotor simply by forcing precession at special quantum magic precession angles. The geometric phase induced by the curved path of the rotor or external curvature {{and part of the}} coupling increases with precession angle. This leads to bifurcations in coupling strength resulting in chaotic precession. As an alternative to the SO(3) matrix or quaternion representation the treatment of the three coupled rotations is here based on Euler’s dynamical equations. First, the classical Magic Angle Precession (MAP) dynamics is realized by a geometric or mechanical condition (type I, transcendental solutions), where it can be experimentally demonstrated how MAP can “slave” angular degrees of freedom allowing the external control of high-frequent spin by slow oscillations. MAP is found in a commercial fitness device and is conceptually approached via Chua’s electric circuit. Second, the quantum-gravitational MAP (type II, rational solutions) with discrete precession angles is analyzed on a deeper level requiring intrinsic curvature/relativistic effects adjusting holonomy to quantum numbers. Third, a macroscopic network of MAP elements is presented as a discretetime recurrent neural network synchronizing to one common MAP I/II dynamics under special pairing and symmetry conditions (type III). In all three cases MAP can be treated as a time-discrete chaotic system with singularities given by the cosine map with several possible links to interesting applications on all scales...|$|R
