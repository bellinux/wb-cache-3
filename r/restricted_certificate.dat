40|$|In December 2008, the European Council and the European Parliament {{agreed on}} a final {{compromise}} for a new European renewable energy directive. One of the most debated issues prior to this compromise was the design of "target flexibility mechanisms", which should allow member states with low or expensive renewable energy potential to partly fulfil their national renewable energy target in other countries. This article traces back the political discussion {{that has led to}} the evolution of the different flexibility options. It then evaluates the most prominent flexibility mechanisms against a set of qualitative criteria. It concludes that free or <b>restricted</b> <b>certificate</b> trade based on guarantees of origin (GOs) - as proposed earlier by the European Commission - is not a viable option due to some "knockout" criteria, despite other potential advantages. The mechanisms that have replaced GO trade in the final compromise - joint projects, joint support schemes and statistical transfer between member states - provide less flexibility, but score better against a number of other important criteria. The crucial question for the coming years is how their utilisation can be facilitated. One first step might be that proactive member states define open design issues for implementing the mechanisms.

40|$|Privacy, authentication, {{confidentiality}} and non repudiation {{are the most}} desired security attributes for all vehicular ad hoc network (VANET) applications. A lot of solutions have been presented to address these issues. However, they are mostly dependent on centralized certificate architecture and some sort of hardware-based security. These solutions are expensive to carry out and lack the incentive for both users and service providers to deploy, which make them especially difficult to be implemented during the important initial deployment stage of VANET. In this paper, we present a distributed security architecture for VANET that does not rest on expensive security hardware or elaborate security infrastructure. The architecture can be incrementally deployed, facilitating small companies to jump in the VANET business, and can fill the void during the VANET initial deployment phase. Our solution is based on spatial and temporal <b>restricted</b> <b>certificates,</b> which are issued upon user’s request {{and can be used}} for various VANET applications. Due to the restricted nature of these certificates, the certificate revocation process is simple and efficient, which solves another drawback of existing solutions...|$|R

30|$|Entrance {{certificates}} {{for higher}} education typically are obtained by graduation from general upper secondary education (Abitur or Fachabitur). Besides this traditional route into higher education, there are several alternative pathways and especially vocational training can also result in entrance qualifications {{for higher education}} 2 (Schindler 2014). The rules for obtaining a higher education entrance certificate via vocational training are very heterogeneous across federal states, but in general students can choose to take extra lessons and exams in maths and languages to obtain a full or <b>restricted</b> entrance <b>certificate.</b> Besides the ‘traditional’ and ‘vocational’ route to a higher education entrance certificate, {{it is also possible}} to enter adult and evening education. In exceptional cases, higher education can be entered without an entrance certificate—but this applies to a small group of approximately 3 % of all students 3 (Dahm and Kerst 2013).|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the design and}} implementation of a payment framework that is loosely based on the direct debit payment model. We define such payments as one in which customers can authorise merchants to bill them repeatedly {{for the provision of}} some service without further interaction with the customers being required. This paper aims to present a first working prototype of our periodical payment model, and to discuss its performance. Our model uses a novel approach for implementing security by employing X. 509 <b>restricted</b> proxy <b>certificates</b> over Secure Socket Layer (SSL) to provide authentication, authorisation and non-repudiation services. Although the concept of electronic payments is hardly new and there is a significant amount of interest in improving its security model, most notably from Visa and MasterCard, periodical payments have been consistently overlooked by these industry heavyweights. As of now this concept remains unexplored and the current approaches for securing electronic transactions make it impossible to accommodate this transaction format. The work presented in this paper attempts to fill this niche by developing a new payment specification and a fully working prototype implementation addressing this issue. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we shall {{introduce}} a new electronic payment concept based on the popular direct debit payment model, entitled periodical payments. The direct debit model currently in use online is neither secure nor flexible, and requires {{a leap of faith}} by the customer who must trust the merchant to behave honestly. Electronic direct debit request (DDR) forms are not signed by both parties in a binding manner, which means that merchants can change the terms of DDR agreements post-fact. Unsigned DDR agreements give the merchant unprecedented power over customer accounts with little recourse for dispute. In this paper we shall demonstrate how the use of <b>restricted</b> proxy <b>certificates</b> with cryptographic signatures can be adopted to support a new periodical payment model. A payment policy language is presented that is tailored towards specifying rules that govern precisely how and when merchants can access and transfer funds from customer accounts into their own. Using this model will ensure that mutually signed policies are instantly enforceable on every transaction within a payment period. There is a fundamental difference between this proposal and other electronic payment schemes. Most such schemes attempt to replicate the features of physical cash such as anonymity, and therefore focus on single payment transactions that simulate cash changing hands. Since direct debit is a popular payment choice, our proposal provides significant improvement to this essentially paper-based payment model that currently does not integrate well in a purely electronic world...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{language}} of Quantied Boolean Formulas (QBF) {{has a lot}} of potential applications to Formal Verification (FV) tasks, as it captures many of these tasks in a natural and compact way. Practical experience has been disappointing though. When compared with contending approaches such as SAT, QBF-based FV has invariably yielded unfavorable experimental results. This paper makes two contributions. We first provide an account of the status quo in QBF-based FV. We examine commonly adopted formalizations and the relative strengths of different decision procedures. In the second part of this paper, we investigate {{for the first time the}} relevance of some advanced QBF techniques to FV tasks. In particular, we describe the use and the benefits of <b>restricted</b> quantifiers, QBF <b>certificates,</b> alternative encodings for classical model checking problems, and encodings with free variables. These promising research perspectives seem to reverse the negative standing of QBF applied to FV, as confirmed by the experimental evidence we discuss. Experiments are conducted by extending the publicly available solver sKizzo in several ways, and they include the worst case studies where QBF compares favorably to SAT, its traditional competitor. QBF turns out to be an order of magnitude faster than SAT in some tasks (e. g., automated design debugging of large circuits). Moreover, as the size of the problems grows, the SAT encodings result in excessive memory requirements leading to out-of-memory conditions, while the more compact QBF encodings continue to be manageable and solvable...|$|R
