With appropriate <b>replacement</b> <b>amounts,</b> the deleterious expansions due to ASR could be reduced by using reactive limestone powder. Author believes that any type of mineral SiO 2 with being grounded to certain fineness can suppress the ASR reactivity of aggregates, and the effectiveness of reactive aggregate powder is better than that of non-reactive aggregate powder. The replacement level that can control expansion varies with the type of mineral SiO 2 and fineness of the aggregate powder...|$|E

Hepatic uptakes of alanine and lactate were calculated using the arteriovenous difference technique. [14 C]Alanine was infused to measure the conversion of alanine and lactate into glucose. Hyperglycemia (delta 115 mg/dl) of 2 h duration caused the plasma alanine level to increase by over 50 %. This change was caused by an increase in the inflow of alanine into plasma since the net hepatic uptake of the amino acid did not change. Taken together, the above findings indicate that glucose per se can significantly impair the fractional extraction of alanine by the liver. Hepatic extraction of lactate was also affected by hyperglycemia and had fallen to zero within 90 min of starting the glucose infusion. This fall was associated with a doubling of arterial lactate level. Conversion of [14 C]-alanine and [14 C]lactate into [14 C]glucose was suppressed by 60 +/- 11 % after 2 h of hyperglycemia, and because this fall could not be entirely accounted for by decreased lactate extraction an inhibitory effect of glucose on gluconeogenesis within the liver is suggested. These studies indicate that the plasma glucose level per se can be an important determinant of the level of alanine and lactate in plasma as well as the rate at which they are converted to glucose...|$|E

Extended device longevity of 5 vs. 9 years for ICDs (Populations A and B); 4 vs. 7 years for CRT-Ds (Populations C and D) were considered. Over a 15 -year time horizon, total, yearly, and per diem savings, per patient, from extending ICD longevity to 9 years were € 10 926. 91, € 728. 46, and € 1. 99 for Population A, and € 7661. 32, € 510. 75, and € 1. 40 for Population B.

From the negative side, methane emission from manure management is a negative environmental externality. The positive externality is the use of dung cake as domestic fuel, which {{can be seen as a}} substitution or replacement of the equivalent amount of thermal energy from fuel-wood or fossil-fuel. It is a great saving on fuel-wood by cutting down of standing forests and trees, and another is the saving of land that is required to produce <b>replacement</b> <b>amount</b> of fuel-wood for dung cake.

40|$|Low water-to-cement (w/c) ratio {{concrete}} {{with a high}} paste content experiences significant autogenous shrinkage {{that may}} amplify the risk of earlyage cracking in restrained elements. Further, the high cement content of these materials increases the carbon-footprint and environmental impact of these materials due to energy consumption and CO 2 emissions associated with cement production. This thesis introduces strategies to produce concrete which reduces or displays similar cracking propensity to traditional cement-based materials, although with a smaller environmental impact. This can be achieved by: (1) replacement of a portion of cement with limestone, (2) fundamentally altering the binder composition by incorporation of alternative binders such as fly ash, or (3) by replacing {{a portion of the}} natural aggregate in concrete with synthetic inclusions which reduce the risk of cracking. ^ First, this study evaluates early-age and long-term volume changes in pastes and mortars made with cements interground with limestone; for a variety of curing times and exposure conditions. The results show mortars made using cements interground with up to 10 % limestone (by mass replacement of cement) demonstrate similar or less early-age and long-term shrinkage as compared to plain cement systems. Limestone systems showed a similar or reduced risk of early-age cracking. Further studies were performed using fine, intermediate, and coarse limestone particles {{to examine the effects of}} limestone particle size and dilution (due to cement replacement by limestone) on the shrinkage and cracking response of pastes and mortars. Finally, the chemical shrinkage and heat of hydration were measured to evaluate whether the presence of limestone alters the rate of reaction in these materials. ^ Second, this study evaluates the shrinkage and cracking behavior of cement-based materials that contain fly ash. Two types of fly ash were examined. The chemical shrinkage of mixtures containing up to 20 % fly ash (mass replacement of cement) was measured to quantify the early-age reactivity of fly ash in binders. Autogenous and total bulk shrinkage due to drying was studied from the time of set up to 28 days. The volume change and cracking susceptibility results varied depending upon type of fly ash and <b>replacement</b> <b>amount.</b> ^ Third, this research includes the study of concrete and mortars that contain low stiffness synthetic aggregate inclusions as a method to mitigate early-age cracking. Restrained and plastic shrinkage of concrete and mortar containing lightweight synthetic particles (LSP) as aggregate replacement are studied. The results indicate a reduction in the potential for cracking with increased replacement of LSP. Furthermore the addition of LSP reduces the susceptibility for plastic shrinkage cracking. ...|$|R

The objectives of this research are to: (i) quantify crop water use, effects of soil-water availability and optimal water management conditions for birdsfoot trefoil grown for seed, (ii) determine the effects of irrigation timing and amount on flower production, seed yield, and yield components, and (iii) quantify the effects of soil-water availability on seed shattering and determine optimal harvest time to reduce seed yield losses due to shattering. Five supplemental irrigations treatments and a non-irrigated control were applied in 1994 and 1995; in 1996, only treatments low stress and non irrigated control were investigated, near Corvallis, OR on a Woodburn silt loam soil (fine-silty, mixed, mesic Aquultic Argixeroll). Increasing amounts of applied water increased seasonal ET[subscript c] with low stressed plants having the greatest ET[subscript c] and non-irrigated control plants the least. The fraction of available soil-water used was primarily dependent upon the irrigation depletion percentage and secondarily dependent upon irrigation <b>replacement</b> <b>amount.</b> Soil-water conditions favorable for vegetative development and seed yield water use efficiency are opposite. Birdsfoot trefoil grown for seed requires minimal or no supplemental irrigation. For non-irrigated conditions, the crop water requirement ranges from 240 to 255 mm. In the first year of production, plants under low-stress conditions sustained flowering longer than with limited or no irrigation applications. Flowering was not affected by irrigation in subsequent years of production. Total above-ground phytomass production was correlated with the amount of applied irrigation water (r= 0. 92). Umbel density and number of seeds per pod are the primary determinants of total seed yield (r= 0. 77 and 0. 92, respectively). Manipulation of the reproductive development pattern by different water application times and amounts does not affect peak seed shattering events. Crop-water stress status affects the percentage of total shattered seeds shattered at harvest time (r=- 0. 76). Increasing amounts of applied water increase the percentage of potential shatter losses that will shatter by harvest time (r= 0. 65). Seed shatter losses fluctuate during the reproductive development period but are not influenced by the water application treatments. Climatic variables as measured in this experiment cannot be used to predict the time of peak seed shatter events. A total of 109 heat units are needed from the time from initial pod dehiscence until rapid shattering occurs...|$|R

Alterations {{in the amount of}} both saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins A, E and folate, and other micronutrients, such as zinc and magnesium, are discussed. In all cases we observe alterations in the pattern of phospholipids, the more affected ones being phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin. The deficiency of certain nutrients, such as essential fatty acids, fat-soluble vitamins and some metals may contribute to a variety of diseases that can be irreversible even after <b>replacement</b> with normal <b>amount</b> of the nutrients. Usually, the sequelae are more important when the deficiency is present at an early age...|$|R
40|$|Background: Various {{methods for}} {{multiple}} imputations of missing values {{are available in}} statistical software. They {{have been shown to}} work well when small proportions of missings were to be imputed. However, some researchers have started to impute large proportions of missings. Method: We performed a simulation using ICE on datasets of 50 / 100 / 200 / 400 cases and 4 / 11 / 25 variables. A varying proportion of data (3 – 63 %) were randomly set missing and subsequently substituted by multiple imputation. Results: (1) It is shown when and how the algorithm breaks down by decreasing n of cases and increasing number of variables in the model. (2) Some unexpected results are demonstrated, e. g. flawed coefficients. (3) Compared to the second program that performs multiple imputations by chained equations, i. e., mice in R, the Stata program, ice, results in a slightly higher precision of the estimates by similar features of the program. Conclusion: The imputation of missings by chained equations is a useful tool for imputing small to moderate proportions of missings. The <b>replacement</b> of larger <b>amounts,</b> however, can be critical. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{quantify}} the amount of bone morphogenic protein 7 (BMP- 7) in bone samples in different storage and treatment conditions used in bone banks and thereby evaluate the benefit of this test as a routine measure before bone grafting. Methods Fresh as well as frozen bone chips, each with and without antibiotic impregnation, were screened for theirBMP- 7 content. Human bone chips were produced from femoral heads of two female donors who had undergone total hip <b>replacement</b> surgery. The <b>amount</b> of BMP- 7 was detected using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Results There were no significant differences between groups in samples obtained from the first femoral head. Bone-chip samples derived from the second femoral head showed significant differences between groups. The actual amount of these differences was small and most likely biologically irrelevant. It is important to note that there was a significant difference between groups when comparing both femoral heads, reflecting donor-to-donor variability. Conclusion ELISA testing for BMP- 7 as a qualitative measurement of bone grafts should be considered a routine quality-control test for bone banks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Phospholipids are {{important}} {{components of the}} cell membranes of all living species. They contribute to the physicochemical properties of the membrane and thus influence the conformation and function of membrane-bound proteins, such as receptors, ion channels, and transporters and also influence cell function by serving as precursors for prostaglandins and other signaling molecules and modulating gene expression through the transcription activation. The components of the diet are determinant for cell functionality. In this review, the effects of macro and micronutrients deficiency on the quality, quantity and metabolism of different phospholipids and their distribution in cells of different organs is presented.
