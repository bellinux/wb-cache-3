5|$|The {{presence}} of certain signs, termed <b>red</b> <b>flags,</b> indicate {{the need for}} further testing to look for more serious underlying problems, which may require immediate or specific treatment. The {{presence of}} a red flag does not mean that there is a significant problem. It is only suggestive, and most people with <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> have no serious underlying problem. If no <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are present, performing diagnostic imaging or laboratory testing in the first four weeks after the start of the symptoms has not been shown to be useful.|$|E
5|$|Since its reactivation, the 69 Squadron {{has also}} {{undertaken}} multiple deployments abroad. It {{was the first}} Israeli unit to participate in exercise Red Flag in October 1998, and has taken part in several <b>Red</b> <b>Flags</b> since. It has also deployed to Turkey and Italy on several occasions, and three aircraft participated in the 2001 RAF Waddington International Air Show.|$|E
5|$|The {{usefulness}} of many <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are poorly supported by evidence. The most useful for detecting a fracture are: older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma {{especially if it}} results in skin markings. The best determinant {{of the presence of}} cancer is a history of the same.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> has had {{multiple}} meanings in history {{but it was}} first used as a flag of defiance. The <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> gained its modern political meaning in the 1871 French Revolution. After the October Revolution, the Soviet government adopted the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> with a superimposed hammer and sickle as its national flag. Since the October Revolution, various socialist states and movements have used the <b>red</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|R

5|$|Sebastian Vettel {{was handed}} a {{five-place}} grid penalty for overtaking Manor's Roberto Merhi under <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> {{during the third}} free practice session. After Max Verstappen qualified twelfth for the race, {{he was unable to}} be placed the full fifteen places back on the grid from both his penalties. As grid penalties were no longer carried over to subsequent races in 2015, he was instead handed a ten-second penalty, to be served with his first pit stop during the race.|$|E
5|$|Workers who {{experience}} acute {{low back pain}} {{as a result of}} a work injury may be asked by their employers to have x-rays. As in other cases, testing is not indicated unless <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are present. An employer's concern about legal liability is not a medical indication and should not be used to justify medical testing when it is not indicated. There should be no legal reason for encouraging people to have tests which a health care provider determines are not indicated.|$|E
5|$|At 10:00a.m., Coast Guard {{stations}} and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Weather Bureau offices at Lake Superior ports raised white pennants above square <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> with black centers, indicating a storm warning with northwesterly winds. By late afternoon, the storm signal flags were {{replaced with a}} vertical sequence of red, white, and red lanterns, indicating that a hurricane with winds over 74mph (119km/h) was coming. (The word hurricane here does not refer to a tropical cyclone, but to Force 12 winds on the Beaufort scale.) The winds on Lake Superior had already reached 50mph (80km/h), and an accompanying blizzard was moving toward Lake Huron.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> was one {{of first}} anarchist symbols. It was widely used in late nineteenth century by anarchists worldwide. Also, Peter Kropotkin {{preferred}} the usage of the <b>red</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On December 22, 1952, the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> was {{replaced}} with a new <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> with a blue and white stripes {{in the middle of}} the entire length of the flag.|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> {{then came}} out to ensue to {{facilitate}} cleanup around the track, After 20 minutes and 23 seconds, the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> was lifted and the field continued under caution.|$|R
5|$|Low {{back pain}} may be {{classified}} {{based on the}} signs and symptoms. Diffuse pain that does not change in response to particular movements, and is localized to the lower back without radiating beyond the buttocks, is classified as nonspecific, the most common classification. Pain that radiates down the leg below the knee, is located on one side (in the case of disc herniation), or is on both sides (in spinal stenosis), and changes in severity in response to certain positions or maneuvers is radicular, making up 7% of cases. Pain that is accompanied by <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> such as trauma, fever, a history of cancer or significant muscle weakness may indicate a more serious underlying problem and is classified as needing urgent or specialized attention.|$|E
5|$|By early 1918, {{the long}} periods of {{inactivity}} had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, including Kaiser Karl VI. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard Sankt Georg and quickly spreading to Kaiser Karl VI. Officers were confined to their quarters while a committee of sailors met to formulate a list of demands, which ranged from longer periods of leave and better rations to {{an end to the}} war, based on the United States President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The following day, shore batteries loyal to the government fired on the old ironclad , which prompted many of the mutinous ships to abandon the effort. Late in the day on 2 February, the <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> were struck from Kaiser Karl VI and she rejoined the loyalist ships in the harbor. The next morning, the s of the III Division arrived in Cattaro, which convinced the last holdouts to surrender. Trials on the ringleaders commenced quickly and four men were executed.|$|E
5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, encouraging people to request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
50|$|MAPLE FLAG can be {{considered}} a Canadian version of the United States Air Force's <b>RED</b> <b>FLAG,</b> which is held several times a year at Nellis Air Force Base (using the Nellis Air Force Range). <b>RED</b> <b>FLAG</b> was conceived during the Vietnam War when the USAF found that 90 percent of combat aircraft losses were during a pilot's first 10 missions; the first <b>RED</b> <b>FLAG</b> occurred in 1975.|$|R
50|$|After 55 minutes {{under the}} <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> (including slow caution periods {{before and after}} it waved), the race restarted. TV {{coverage}} moved to ESPN2 due {{to the length of}} the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> period.|$|R
5|$|The {{birth of}} the yellow, green, and red tricolor {{occurred}} during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life {{to the idea of}} the tricolor was the French blue, white and <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolor that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green and <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> was a green, white and <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> used to represent Lithuania Minor.|$|R
5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} <b>red</b> <b>flags,</b> ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two technologies are equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
5|$|In the Jamiltepec {{region of}} Mexico, there exists {{perhaps the most}} {{colorful}} version {{of that kind of}} dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{topped the}} time sheets {{in the second}} session, now {{switching}} to the soft compound tyres as well, with Nico Rosberg two and a half-tenths of a second clear of Kimi Räikkönen, while Lewis Hamilton was third fastest, more than seven tenths off Rosberg's time. Räikkönen's running was interrupted for a while when he was called back into the pitlane to investigate a fuel system problem, but {{was able to get}} back out. Fernando Alonso was seventh fastest for McLaren, but needed a replacement of his car's plank after running wide over artificial grass surrounding the track. His teammate, Jenson Button, also experienced problems, having to stop {{at the end of the}} pitlane early in the session with an electrical issue. Renault's problem from the first session continued: Jolyon Palmer, back in his car in place of Ocon, suffered a tyre failure on the start-finish straight, bringing out <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> in the process. Renault and tyre supplier Pirelli were left puzzled over the failure, as in this incident, no sign of a cut from debris was found.|$|E
50|$|The {{flag of the}} Soviet Union {{consisted}} of a plain <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> with a gold hammer crossed with a gold sickle placed beneath a gold-bordered red star. This symbol is in the upper left canton of the <b>red</b> <b>flag.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The flag of Turkey (Türk bayrağı) is a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> {{featuring}} a white star and crescent. The flag {{is often called}} [...] (the <b>red</b> <b>flag),</b> and {{is referred to as}} [...] (the red banner) in the Turkish national anthem.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{fourteen}} cars, eleven were damaged beyond repair. The <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> came out, {{and after the}} cleanup, the race lined up for a restart with only 22 cars. The <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> delay was about 1 hour and 24 minutes.|$|R
5|$|Qualifying was {{scheduled}} to consist of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. The first part of qualifying (Q1) was disrupted after a little more than five minutes, when Sainz crashed at turn four, bringing out <b>red</b> <b>flags.</b> Due to the prospect of worsening rain and the chance that qualifying could be brought to an end by the weather at any point, the teams fought for grid positions early on, with Lewis Hamilton, Nico Rosberg and Daniel Ricciardo setting the fastest times. Apart from Sainz, both Manor Marussia drivers were eliminated, along with the two Sauber cars of Marcus Ericsson and Felipe Nasr. Sebastian Vettel, after making contact with a barrier, finished Q1 in fifteenth place, barely making it into Q2.|$|E
5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the healthiness of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race: each lasted for 75 minutes. A test session, scheduled for Friday afternoon, ran for 90 minutes. Conditions were dry for the Friday {{practice sessions}}. De Ferran was fastest {{in the first}} practice session {{with a time of}} 59.107 seconds; his teammate Castroneves was second and Tony Kanaan third. Jimmy Vasser was fourth-fastest, ahead of Tagliani and Christian Fittipaldi. Da Matta, Patrick Carpentier, Franchitti and Paul Tracy rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Four <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> came out: the first came when a fuel cover from Carpentier's car was located on the racing line, The second was for Bruno Junqueira who spun in turn eight and stalled on track, the third for Andretti who made contact with the turn eight tire barrier and damaged his left-front suspension; Bräck went onto the turn's run-off area to avoid hitting Andretti. The final stoppage was for de Ferran who slid into the turn one tire barrier and damaged his front-end.|$|E
5000|$|Red - A <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> {{means that}} there has been a serious {{incident}} and that the track day session has been stopped. Under a <b>red</b> <b>flag,</b> you will need to slow down and return to the pits, or as directed, without overtaking.|$|R
50|$|Red is the {{traditional}} color of warning and danger. In the Middle Ages, a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> announced that the defenders of a town or castle would fight to defend it, and a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> hoisted by a warship meant they would show no mercy to their enemy. In Britain, {{in the early days}} of motoring, motor cars had to follow a man with a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> who would warn horse-drawn vehicles, before the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 abolished this law. In automobile races, the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> is raised if there is danger to the drivers. In international football, a player who has made a serious violation of the rules is shown a red penalty card and ejected from the game.|$|R
25|$|In 1354, King of Bohemia Charles IV {{prescribed}} for the Jews of Prague a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> with both David's shield and Solomon's seal, while the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> {{with which the}} Jews met King Matthias of Hungary in the 15th century showed two pentagrams with two golden stars.|$|R
5|$|In {{the second}} session on Friday afternoon, Nico Rosberg was fastest, setting a time of 1:21.531. With the track tarmac still being very new, the surface was {{slippery}} and it was another session that {{saw a lot of}} drivers get caught out. The biggest accident of the practice came after just five minutes, when Max Verstappen crashed at the exit of the stadium, bringing out <b>red</b> <b>flags.</b> After the running resumed, Valtteri Bottas lost the rear of his Williams FW37, caused by a fault in his DRS flap, and crashed at turn one. He {{was not the only one}} having problems in the first corner, as Sergio Pérez, Carlos Sainz Jr. and Pastor Maldonado also went off there. Lewis Hamilton meanwhile had an off-track moment at turn four. Romain Grosjean had to end his first practice of the weekend early, when a clutch failure saw him park his car 28 minutes into the session. Jenson Button ran 25 laps and finished ninth fastest albeit spending half of the session in the pit lane, while the team equipped his car with a new power unit. Behind Rosberg, the two Red Bull drivers were second and third, ahead of Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the first}} World Championship Grand Prix in 1950, <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> {{have been shown}} in seventy races, with the latest one being at the 2017 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on 25 June 2017. Twenty-six were {{restarted}} on the first lap. Thirteen races were not restarted, nine because of rain and four due to accidents involving drivers. Five races were stopped due to incidents that resulted in fatalities: The 1975 Spanish Grand Prix was stopped on lap twenty-nine and not restarted after Rolf Stommelen's car crashed into a spectator area, killing five people. The 1978 Italian Grand Prix was red-flagged after a massive crash that ultimately contributed {{to the death of}} Ronnie Peterson. The 1982 Canadian Grand Prix was halted on the first lap after Riccardo Paletti was killed when his car collided with the back of Didier Pironi's Ferrari. The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was red-flagged on lap five following the fatal accident of Ayrton Senna, in which his car crashed into a wall at the Tamburello curve. The 2014 Japanese Grand Prix was red-flagged for a second time following a serious collision between Jules Bianchi and a recovery vehicle which would ultimately prove to be fatal.|$|E
5|$|The Moscow militsiya {{sealed off}} {{downtown}} Moscow during the funeral on 15 November. Large avenues were tightly guarded {{by the police}} and the Moscow military garrison. The soldiers, who {{stood in front of the}} House of the Unions, wore black-edged red armbands. The House of the Unions was decorated by numerous <b>red</b> <b>flags</b> and other communist symbols. Brezhnev's body lay in state for three days at the House of the Unions. On the third day the coffin was placed on an artillery carriage towed by an olive-green BRDM-2 armored vehicle of the Red Army—led by dozens of wreaths as well as Brezhnev's decorations carried by Soviet military personnel and other mourners—to the Lenin Mausoleum on the Red Square, where it was greeted by speeches by Andropov; Minister of Defence Dmitriy Ustinov; Anatoly Alexandrov, the President of the Academy of Sciences; and a factory worker. After the speeches, pallbearers, led by Andropov and Nikolai Tikhonov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, carried the coffin to another location close to the mausoleum. It was here that Brezhnev's family made their farewell. Before the body was laid to rest Viktoria kissed Brezhnev on the face in accordance with Russian traditions. As Brezhnev's body was lowered into the grave a military squad saluted while an orchestra played the Soviet national anthem. According to Time magazine Brezhnev's death was mourned by the majority of Soviets.|$|E
5000|$|For 2003 and 2004, the <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> {{rules were}} {{clarified}} somewhat to standardize the use, {{with a specific}} lap, usually five laps remaining, being the lap designated as the [...] "last <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> lap." [...] Television would mention such a lap during the race specifics on broadcasts.|$|R

25|$|In the Middle Ages, {{ships in}} combat hoisted a long red streamer, called the Baucans, to signify {{a fight to}} the death. In the 17th century, a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> signalled defiance. A besieged castle or city would raise a <b>red</b> <b>flag</b> to tell the attackers {{that they would not}} surrender.|$|R
