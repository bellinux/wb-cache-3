40|$|Data are {{presented}} on growth, flowering and yield of dwarf green, dwarf yellow and dwarf <b>red</b> <b>palms.</b> The short leaf span of this variety {{makes it possible}} to grow about 227 palms per hectare (92 palms per acre). All three colour forms bear early when compared with the commercially grown typica palm. However, the dwarf are a failure as a plantation crop for they yield not more than 1. 25 - 2. 50 tonnes of copra per hectare (half to one ton of copra per acre). As dwarf nuts are small overall production costs per unit of copra would be high. The dwarf yield 85 - 113 g. (3 - 4 ozs.) copra per nut, which is low in comparison with the Ceylon typica (226 g. or 8 oz. copra per nut). Nevertheless, the dwarf variety constitutes a valuable source of breeding material on account of its early bearing character...|$|R

6000|$|Of palmers (the hairy caterpillars) {{are many}} sorts. Ephemera gives {{by far the}} best list yet published. Ronalds has also three good ones, but whether they are really taken by trout instead of the {{particular}} natural insects which he mentions, is not very certain. The little coch-a-bonddhu palmer, so killing upon moor streams, may probably be taken for young larvae of the fox and oak-egger moths, abundant on all moors, upon trefoils, and other common plants; but the lowland caterpillars are so abundant and so various in colour that trout must be good entomologists to distinguish them. Some distinction they certainly make; for one palmer will kill where another does not: but this depends a good deal on the colour of the water; the <b>red</b> <b>palmer,</b> being easily seen, will kill almost anywhere and any when, simply because it is easily seen; and both the grizzle and brown palmer may be made to kill by adding to the tail a tuft of red floss silk; for red, it would seem, has the same exciting effect on fish which it has upon many quadrupeds, possibly because it is the colour of flesh. The mackerel will often run greedily at a strip of scarlet cloth; and the most killing pike-fly I ever used had a body made of remnants of the huntsman's new 'pink.' Still, there are local palmers. On Thames, for instance, I have seldom failed with the grizzled palmer, while the brown has seldom succeeded, and the usually infallible red never. There is one more palmer worth trying, which Scotsmen, I believe, call the Royal Charlie; a coch-a-bonddhu or furnace hackle, over a body of gold-coloured floss silk, ribbed with broad gold tinsel. Both in Devonshire and in Hampshire this will kill great quantities of fish, wherever furzy or otherwise wild banks or oak-woods afford food for the oak-egger and fox moths, which children call 'Devil's Gold Rings,' and Scotsmen 'Hairy Oubits.' ...|$|R
