40|$|We studied on the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> {{pectinesterase}} and polygalacturonase {{occurring in}} pectic enzyme preparation from Sclerotinia libertiana, and compared the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> the crude enzymes {{with that of}} the enzymes after purification by ammonium sulfate fractionation. The resuts are following [table] The optimum p. H. of polygalacturonase decreased to 4. 5 from 5 after purification. The more decrease of p. H. is expected when we purify the enzyme more completely. In the comparison test of pectic enzyme preparation from Sclerotinia libertiana with fungal pectic enzyme preparation, it is remarkable that we recognize no <b>activity</b> <b>of</b> polygalacturonase in the latter, but the preparation accelerates the clarification of fruit juice...|$|R
