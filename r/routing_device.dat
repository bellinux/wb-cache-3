5000|$|IP {{masquerading}} is {{a technique}} that hides an entire IP address space, usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in another, usually public address space.

40|$|Trust {{plays an}} {{important}} role in our daily life, both implicitly and explicitly. Our decisions are based on our estimation of how trustworthy a person is or how reliable a service is. Consequently, there has been a rise in trust systems that model human trust in a virtual or computing environment. These trust systems or trust models help to bridge the gap of human feelings and intuition in an unfamiliar environment. Trust models collect information regarding the participants' activities and give a trust rating based on observed activities. In a network environment, a plethora of network devices are in constant communication as data packets are transported from source to destination. The autonomous nature of network environments and devices make it difficult to monitor the services and devices from a central point. Security mechanisms, such as IPSec, exist in routing protocols to safeguard network packets travelling in a network, however routing devices that act as service providers are not protected by malicious attacks. For example, an attack aimed at the routing architecture of a network involves a <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> advertising itself as another <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> in order to divert network traffic away from its intended destination. This dissertation investigates trust models in network environments as a possible approach to predict and ultimately eliminate at- tacks on routing devices. To accomplish this, the role of routing devices as service providers and requesters must be stated explicitly. Activities on a <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> must be collected and used to determine the trust level of the <b>routing</b> <b>device.</b> This dissertation presents the TSONE - Trust in Service-Oriented Net- work Environment - model. The model incorporates traditional service- oriented architecture (SOA) principles to define a service-oriented network environment. Services in this environment are then defined. Furthermore the characteristics of this environment are adapted from SOA principles. An approach is defined to collect and measure activities on routing devices. This is later used to determine the trust level of the <b>routing</b> <b>device.</b> Finally, a pro- to type illustrates that incorporation of trust models is a possible option in assessing availability and reliability of routing devices.

Link-state routing protocols generate routing updates only when a change occurs in the network topology.

40|$|Characteristic for ad-hoc {{wireless}} sensor networks is {{the lack}} of a centralized control. Instead each node serves as a <b>routing</b> <b>device,</b> which is able to forward packets to its neighbors 1 and receive packets from them. Node movement is allowed, but rare for sensor nodes. Each node is able to be switched on and off at any time depending on its power saving configuration. Such networks are extremely vulnerable to user misbehavior. Since nodes within an ad-hoc sensor network are expected to have limited computational power and be battery powered, a system that is going to protect them has to be lightweight. It has to be adaptive too, as ad-hoc sensor networks are expected to operate autonomously with only spare maintenance. Classical intrusion detectio...|$|E

While the layer-2 functionality is adequate for bandwidth-shifting within one technology, interconnecting technologies such as Ethernet and token ring is performed easier at layer 3 or via <b>routing.</b> <b>Devices</b> that interconnect at the layer 3 are traditionally called routers, so layer 3 switches can also be regarded as relatively primitive and specialized routers.|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to the benefits brought by network virtualization, the shared use of <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> and communication channels introduces a series of security-related concerns.

Additionally, the infrastructure could be a target for denial of service attacks, causing availability issues for virtual networks instantiated on top of it [6, 7]. Therefore, it is of great importance that network virtualization architectures offer protection against these and other types of threats that might compromise security.|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Node {{mobility}} and physical channel effects cause {{the quality of}} links in wireless networks to fluctuate randomly. At the network layer, these changes are accommodated by the control information (overhead) of routing protocols. We provide lower bounds on the minimum average control overhead of deterministic routing protocols. When <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> use noisy, out-of-date, or guess topology information, routing errors will occur. The number of “routing errors ” experienced by well known routing schemes grows nontrivially with increased estimation noise.

40|$|Abstract — Trust {{has become}} an {{important}} feature of security. Originally having {{its roots in the}} social sciences, it has fast moved into the field of computer science and more recently into the domain of network security. It is becoming important for scientists to model human trust, especially in a network environment where a lack of trust between network devices, such as routers, can result in poor quality of service and an increase in security compromises. In a network environment there is no “behaviour ” indicator for routing devices about other devices on their forwarding path. Thus, relying on another <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> might be difficult if a secure and reliable service is not available. In this paper we present our ongoing implementation of trust in service-oriented network environments and explain how trust is implemented between network devices. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{advantages}} of employing passive optical architectures in the access network {{have been largely}} recognized. Particularly, recent developments in optical technologies have made the realization of wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks (WDM PON's) feasible and cost-effective. These networks are more future-proof than conventional PON's, thanks to their intrinsic optical transparency and their extremely high transmission capacity. A very useful optical <b>routing</b> <b>device,</b> called Waveguide Grating Router, is the basic building-block of new PON architectures capable of connecting {{a large number of}} users or to improve the use of the optical bandwidth. In this paper, we analyze the connectivity of WDM PON's composed of multiple stages of WGR devices. A design tool is also presented which is able to easily evaluate the connectivity functions of complex WDM PON's. The feasibility of these architectures is discussed by considering the costs and the technological limitations on the optical components...|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} {{that the number of}} changes needed (axis y) to re-adjust the network to the new demand is proportional 1) to the percentage of SFCs with increased demand and 2) to the demand values exceeded (x-axis). In addition, it {{is observed}} that the number of changes related to the repositioning of VNFs is substantially lower compared to that observed for reassignment of flows and re-engineering of SFCs. This indicates the feasibility of our model in real environments, since the time required to instantiate (or migrate) a VNF is substantially higher (in the order of milliseconds to seconds) than that of reprogramming a <b>routing</b> <b>device</b> (order of milliseconds), for example. Also, comparing to the baseline, one may observe that our model reduces by 25 % the number of changes related to VNF placement and by up to twice the number of changes related to the chaining and reassignments of SFCs to VNFs.|$|E

They give out names and addresses (IP addresses) to each connected node and regulate the traffic between them. In wireless grids, such dedicated <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> are not (always) available and the bandwidth that is permanently available to traditional networks has to be either 'borrowed' from an already existing network or publicly accessible bandwidth (open spectrum) has to be used.|$|R
30|$|This {{result is}} of {{importance}} for <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> as they typically optimize routes by minimizing {{the sum of the}} expected link travel times. More accurate predicted link travel times will lead to better routes and hence save time and costs. Our results indicate that the user should provide information on the preferred accuracy measure in order to choose the optimal method for predicting link travel times as the input to the routing: If one is interested in minimizing the mean squared error (as is relevant for logistics applications), then the direct method should be selected. However, if one is interested in obtaining a small mean absolute percentage error (as is arguably of more interest for individual travel time predictions), then the indirect method achieves better results.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multiport {{switches}} {{are commonly}} used as data processing and <b>routing</b> <b>devices</b> in computer networks. A network switch routes data packets between its multiple input and output ports. Packets from input ports are stored upon arrival in a switch fabric comprising multiple memory banks. This can lead to memory contention when distinct output ports request packets from the same memory bank, resulting in a degraded switching bandwidth. To solve this problem, switch codes are introduced by Wang et al. [1] as a tradeoff between redundancy and service. Using techniques from combinatorial design theory, we im-prove their result on switch codes serving any one-burst request to a denser set of parameters. New constructions for switch codes serving repetition limited request and consecutive-generation request are also given. I...|$|R
