2500|$|The {{bottom part}} of the reactor is {{enclosed}} in a watertight compartment. There is a space between the reactor bottom and the floor. The reactor cavity overpressure protection system consists of steam relief assemblies embedded in the floor and leading to Steam Distributor Headers covered with rupture discs and opening into the Steam Distribution Corridor below the reactor, on level +6. The floor of the corridor contains entrances {{of a large number}} of vertical pipes, leading to the bottoms of the Pressure Suppression Pools ("bubbler" [...] pools) located on levels +3 and +0. In the event of an accident, which was predicted to be at most a rupture of one or two pressure channels, the steam was to be bubbled through the water and condensed there, reducing the overpressure in the leaktight compartment. The flow capacity of the pipes to the pools limited the protection capacity to simultaneous rupture of two pressure channels; a higher number of failures would cause pressure buildup sufficient to lift the cover plate ("Structure E", after the explosion nicknamed [...] "Elena"), sever the rest of the fuel channels, destroy the control rod insertion system, and potentially also withdraw control rods from the core. The containment was designed to handle failures of the downcomers, pumps, and distribution and inlet of the feedwater. The leaktight compartments around the pumps can withstand overpressure of 0.45MPa. The distribution headers and inlets enclosures can handle 0.08MPa and are vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The reactor cavity can handle overpressure of 0.18MPa and is vented via check valves to the leaktight compartment. The pressure suppression system can handle a failure of one reactor channel, a pump pressure header, or a distribution header. Leaks in the steam piping and separators are not handled, except for maintaining slightly lower pressure in the <b>riser</b> <b>pipe</b> gallery and the steam drum compartment than in the reactor hall. These spaces are also not designed to withstand overpressure. The steam distribution corridor contains surface condensers. The fire sprinkler systems, operating during both accident and normal operation, are fed from the pressure suppression pools through heat exchangers cooled by the plant service water, and cool the air above the pools. Jet coolers are located in the topmost parts of the compartments; their role is to cool the air and remove the steam and radioactive aerosol particles.|$|E

40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the main sources of {{renewable}} energy that is abundantly available throughout the world. Solar energy can be used for useful purposes through a number of mechanical artefacts. One such artefact is known as Thermo-syphon, which typically contains water as its working fluid. One of the major applications of Thermo-syphon is within the residential and industrial units, where a constant supply of hot water is required. The use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) based solvers has recently been proven capable of predicting the flow behaviour within thermo-syphons with reasonable accuracy. Hence, the present study focuses on using a commercial CFD based solver to predict the flow behaviour within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> of a thermo-syphon with varying solar heat flux and thermal loading conditions. In order to qualitatively and quantitatively analyse the flow structure within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> of the thermo-syphon, velocity magnitude and static temperature distributions within these pipes is analysed in detail. The results depict that the solar heat flux has a significant impact on the velocity magnitude and static temperature profiles within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes.</b> Furthermore, it has been observed that the thermal loading has negligible effects on the velocity magnitude and static temperature profiles within the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes.</b> The data has also been used to develop novel design correlations...|$|R
50|$|A design {{weakness}} of earlier classes solved by the Tench re-design were the ballast tank vent <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> that {{passed through the}} interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving and allowing water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the vent valves (the top of the tank) could not be used. The <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> allowed the tanks to vent but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure inside the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward {{of the end of the}} pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT's. This move eliminated the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable fuel oil tank as mentioned above. These changes forced the rearrangement of the associated piping runs and the location of many of the other tanks. Remarkably, these changes resulted in a boat that was visually almost indistinguishable from the earlier Balao class, with the exception of a sharper angle (or knuckle) at the lower corner of the bow (only visible when the boat was drydocked).|$|R

50|$|Although {{the use of}} {{elevated}} {{water storage}} tanks has existed since ancient times in various forms, the modern use of water towers for pressurized public water systems developed during the mid-19th century, as steam-pumping became more common, and better pipes that could handle higher pressures were developed. In the United Kingdom, standpipes consisted of tall, exposed, n-shaped pipes, used for pressure relief {{and to provide a}} fixed elevation for steam-driven pumping engines which tended to produce a pulsing flow, while the pressurized water distribution system required constant pressure. Standpipes also provided a convenient fixed location to measure flow rates. Designers typically enclosed the <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> in decorative masonry or wooden structures.

The behaviour of the <b>pipe</b> <b>riser</b> (grade API 5 L X 60 steel) was studied using Ramberg–Osgood model. Two composites laminate systems, a pre-cured prepreg (grade AS 4 3501 - 6 carbon/epoxy) and a wet-layup filament-wounded composite (grade Gevetex LY 556 /HT 917 /DY 063 E-glass/epoxy), were characterised. Design conditions were determined via a limit analysis known as the double-elastic slope method. The results showed that under combined hoop, tensile and bending loads, the riser tends to approach failure at a much lower strain compared with each of these loads being applied individually. The limiting design factor of the composite repair system was due to excessive tensile strain experienced in a bent riser while the compressive stress caused by reversing the bending load occurred well within the linear-elastic region. With respect to the types of composite repair system, carbon fibre displayed a much better strength rehabilita-tion over glass fibre.

40|$|Two-phase {{slug flow}} {{is a common}} {{occurrence}} in wells, <b>riser</b> <b>pipes</b> and pipelines of crude {{oil and natural gas}} systems. Current predictive tools for two-phase flow are based on either the mixture model or the mechanistic two-fluid model. The latter one, also called phenomenological model, requires the use of closure relations to solve the transfer of mass, momentum and energy between the phases, in the respective conservation equations, so that integral flow parameters such as liquid holdup (or void fraction) and pressure gradient can be predicted. How ever, these closure relations carry the highest uncertainties in the model, since they are obtained empirically or through the use of overly simplified assumptions. In particular, significant discrepancies have been found between experimental data and closure relations for the Taylor bubble velocity in slug flow, which has been determined through an in-house study to strongly affect the pressure gradient and liquid holdup predicted by the mechanistic models of (Orell and Rembrand, 1986), (Ansari et al., 1994), and (Petalas and Aziz, 2000). In this work, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and the Level Set (LS) interface tracking method(ITM), implemented in the commercial code TransAT®, are mployed to simulate the motion of Taylor bubbles in slug flow. Therefore, a numerical database is being generated to develop a new, high-fidelity closure relation for the Taylor bubble velocity {{as a function of the}} fluid properties and flow conditions, rendered non-dimensional through the use of the Froude, Reynolds, Eötvös and Morton numbers, and pipe inclination angle. The simulations suggest that in inclined pipes the Taylor bubble velocity is strongly reduced if there is no lubricating liquid film between the bubble and the wall.
