25|$|The {{reason for}} {{surgical}} repair of type A dissections is that ascending aortic dissections often involve the aortic valve, which, having lost its suspensory support, telescopes {{down into the}} aortic root, resulting in aortic incompetence. The valve must be <b>resuspended</b> {{in order to be}} reseated, as well as to repair or prevent coronary artery injury. Also, the area of dissection is removed and replaced with a Dacron graft to prevent further dissection from occurring. However, type B dissections are not improved, from a mortality point of view, by the operation, unless leaking, rupture, or compromise to other organs, e.g. kidneys, occurs.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, the Department of Energy's {{public affairs}} group {{published}} a pamphlet {{stating that the}} inhalation of sediments that become <b>resuspended</b> in the air is considered the most significant pathway that could expose human beings to plutonium from the contaminated local reservoirs, but also stated that the airborne plutonium concentrations as measured by downwind air monitors remained below the DOE standard. In a 1999 analysis, {{it was found that}} [...] "the major event contributing the highest individual risk from plutonium released from Rocky Flats was the 1957 fire," [...] with wind distribution of plutonium from the 903 Pad Storage Area being the next greatest source of health risk. In this analysis, health risk estimates for off-site humans had a variance of four orders of magnitude, from [...] "between 2.0 × 10−4 (95th percentile) and 2.2 × 10−8 (5th percentile), with a median risk estimate of 2.3 × 10−6." [...] The DOE maintains a list of Rocky Flats epidemiological studies.|$|E
500|$|A 1997 {{international}} expedition of mainly Danish and Finnish scientists {{carried out}} a comprehensive sediment sampling program in North Star Bay. The main conclusions were: plutonium has not moved from the contaminated sediments into the surface water in the shelf sea; the debris has been buried to a great depth in the sediment {{as a result of}} biological activity; transfer of plutonium to benthic biota is low. Other research indicates that uranium is leaching from the contaminated particles faster than plutonium and americium. Research conducted in 2003 concluded, [...] "Plutonium in the marine environment at Thule presents an insignificant risk to man. Most plutonium remains in the seabed under Bylot Sound far from man under relatively stable conditions and concentrations of plutonium in seawater and animals are low. However, the plutonium contamination of surface soil at Narsaarsuk could constitute a small risk to humans visiting the location if radioactive particles are <b>resuspended</b> in the air so that they might be inhaled." [...] In 2003, 2007 and 2008, the first samples were taken on land by the Risø National Laboratory—the findings were published in 2011.|$|E

40|$|The {{collision}} of a rigid {{body with a}} layer of dust may dislodge and <b>resuspend</b> the dust particles through two distinct mechanisms: a ballistic mechanism, where kinetic energy is transferred from the impacting body to the dust particles through direct contact, and a hydrodynamic mechanism, where the flow disturbance generated by the body moving towards or away from the wall is responsible for <b>resuspending</b> the dust. We present a study of the hydrodynamic resuspension mechanism by considering the flow around a sphere moving with a constant velocity towards a wall and comes impulsively to rest on making contact with the wall. We examine the rôle this flow plays in <b>resuspending</b> a layer of dust. The experiments were performed using a sphere moving perpendicular to the wall for Reynolds numbers, Re, in the range 300 to 3500. A wider range of Re was investigated by releasing dense rigid spheres above the wall. The flow generated by the sphere impacting the wall, and the ability of this to dislodge and <b>resuspend</b> a layer of dust is reported. 1...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that a {{sediment}} of settled particles can <b>resuspend</b> under the action of shear. In this paper, based on a mathematical model given by Leighton & Acrivos [6], we study theoretically the viscous resuspension of a sediment in a Couette channel with harmonically oscillating walls. Numerical experiments reveal that the resuspension height and the particle volume concentration {{at the bottom of}} the channel depend on the frequency of the oscillation. While oscillation of the top wall has nearly no influence on the sediment, a moving bottom wall causes the settled particles to completely <b>resuspend</b> if the frequency is large enough. 1 Introduction A settled bed of negatively buoyant particles can <b>resuspend</b> when in comes in contact with a clear fluid, even if Brownian motion or turbulence at very small Reynolds numbers are absent. This phenomenon, called viscous resuspension, was first observed by Gadala -Maria [3] and Gadala-Maria & Acrivos [4], and has been the subject of several exp [...] ...|$|R

50|$|When fibers or {{asbestos}} structures from asbestos containing materials (ACM) become airborne, {{the process}} is called primary release.

40|$|The Small Column Ion Exchange (SCIX) {{process is}} being {{developed}} to remove cesium, strontium, and actinides from Savannah River Site (SRS) Liquid Waste using an existing waste tank (i. e., Tank 41 H) to house the process. Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) is conducting pilot-scale mixing tests to determine the pump requirements for suspending and <b>resuspending</b> monosodium titanate (MST), crystalline silicotitanate (CST), and simulated sludge. The purpose of this pilot scale testing is for the pumps to <b>resuspend</b> the MST, CST, and simulated sludge particles {{so that they can}} be removed from the tank, and to suspend the MST so it can contact strontium and actinides. The pilot-scale tank is a 1 / 10. 85 linear scaled model of Tank 41 H. The tank diameter, tank liquid level, pump nozzle diameter, pump elevation, and cooling coil diameter are all 1 / 10. 85 of their dimensions in Tank 41 H. The pump locations correspond to the proposed locations in Tank 41 H by the SCIX program (Risers B 5, B 3, and B 1). Previous testing showed that three Submersible Mixer Pumps (SMPs) will provide sufficient power to initially suspend MST in an SRS waste tank, and to <b>resuspend</b> MST that has settled in a waste tank at nominal 45 C for four weeks. The conclusions from this analysis are: (1) Three SMPs will be able to <b>resuspend</b> more than 99. 9 % of the MST and CST that has settled for four weeks at nominal 45 C. The testing shows the required pump discharge velocity is 84 % of the maximum discharge velocity of the pump. (2) Three SMPs will be able to <b>resuspend</b> more than 99. 9 % of the MST, CST, and simulated sludge that has settled for four weeks at nominal 45 C. The testing shows the required pump discharge velocity is 82 % of the maximum discharge velocity of the pump.
