Our findings suggest that there are two groups of residents who are apt to be prematurely terminated from the program due to running behavior.

In some cases, the accretion flow is resolved {{down to the}} surface of the solid core [...] the first time such simulations have been performed. We investigate the dependence of the gas accretion rate upon the planetary core mass, and the surface density and opacity of the encompassing protoplanetary disc. Accretion of planetesimals is neglected. We find that high-mass protoplanets are surrounded by thick circumplanetary discs during their gas accretion phase but, contrary to locally-isothermal calculations, discs do not form around accreting protoplanets with masses ~< 50 M_Earth when radiation hydrodynamical simulations are performed, even if the grain opacity is reduced from interstellar values by a factor of 100. We find that the opacity of the gas plays a large role in determining the accretion rates for low-mass planetary cores. For example, reducing the opacities from interstellar values by a factor of 100 leads to roughly an order of magnitude increase in the accretion rates for 10 - 20 M_Earth protoplanets. The dependence on opacity becomes less important in determining the accretion rate for more massive cores where gravity dominates the effects of thermal support and the protoplanet is essentially accreting at the <b>runaway</b> <b>rate.</b> Finally, for low-mass planetary cores (~< 20 M_Earth), we obtain accretion rates that are in agreement with previous one-dimensional quasi-static models.

30|$|In some sense, this {{behavior}} is {{an artifact of}} the model used—perfect integration is only possible if the feedback perfectly counters the decay of the firing rate over a range of different rates, which is possible in this model because rate increases linearly with feedback and feedback increases linearly with rate. However, such a balance is also achievable with nonlinear rate/feedback relationships if they are locally linear over the relevant range of firing rates. In particular, if the firing rate is a sigmoidal function of input and the eigenvalue of firing rate dynamics near a fixed point is near zero, {{the upper and lower}} rate limits act to control <b>runaway</b> firing <b>rates</b> while the system acts as an integrator in the neighborhood of the fixed point. In [8], we show that a recurrent network of biophysically detailed neurons with sigmoidal activation curves can be robustly tuned by dual homeostasis to act as an integrator.|$|R

40|$|Disruptions {{in large}} tokamaks {{can lead to}} the {{generation}} of a relativistic runaway electron beam that may cause serious damage to the first wall. To mitigate the disruption and suppress the runaway beam the application of resonant magnetic perturbations has been suggested. In this work we investigate the effect of resonant magnetic perturbations on the confinement of runaway electrons by simulating their drift orbits in magnetostatic perturbed fields and calculating the orbit losses for various initial energies and magnetic perturbation magnitudes. In the simulations we use a TEXTOR-like configuration and solve the relativistic, gyro-averaged drift equations for the runaway electrons including synchrotron radiation and collisions. The results indicate that runaway electrons are well confined in the core of the device, but the onset time of runaway losses closer to the edge is dependent on the magnetic perturbation level and thereby can affect the maximum runaway current. However, the <b>runaway</b> current damping <b>rate</b> is not sensitive to the magnetic perturbation level, in agreement with experimental observations...|$|R

40|$|The runaway {{avalanche}} {{process is}} different from the Dreicer runaway mechanism by the much smaller threshold electric field. The "knock-on " source produced by large angle Coulomb scattering is a key ingredient for secondary energetic electron generation which reduces the electric field requirement. The lower hybrid waves, by effectively accelerating the secondary electrons, can alter the growth rate and magnitude of the avalanche process. This paper presents the first demonstration by numerical simulation ofthe Fokker-Planck equation, including large angle Coulomb scattering, that significant enhancement of the <b>runaway</b> production <b>rate</b> is possible. Keywords: runawav electrons. lower hybrid waves 1. lntroduction The "knock-on " source is a key ingredient in recent studies of secondary electron production by runaway avalanche during tokamak disruptions [] and disruption mitigation using giant pellet injection [2]. The avalanche depends on the existence of some trace amount of very energetic electrons (MeV and above) in the plasma. These electrons can knock out bulk electrons to supercritical energies (r. e., above the energy where the electric field acceleration balances the collisional drag) through large angle collisions. They become runaways and can positively feedback on the knock out process resulting in an avalanche effect. This process is distinct from the process discussed by Dreicer [3] by the much smaller threshold electric field E " (smaller than the Dreicer field Ee Ay v?tc 2) and the relatively long growth time for the knock-out runaways to build up. A comprehensive, relativistic theory of knock-on avalanche has been developed, and has been validated by Monte-Carlo simulations [4] and Fokker-Planck calculations [5].

This sudden upturn in deposition rate {{is a result of the}} increasing proximity of the Avalon mountain belt, which started to depress the plate from the Ordovician, but was not close enough to increase the sedimentary input until the Silurian. The latest phase of sedimentation reflected a change in the basin's state. Instead of being underfilled, and trapping all sediment that flowed into it, it became overfilled. This was reflected by a shallowing of water depth, as the basin silted up. This culminated with a transition to terrestrial conditions in the Přídolí.|$|R
40|$|In AM CVn binaries, a {{white dwarf}} primary accretes {{material}} from a helium-rich white dwarf or stellar companion.

The most massive envelopes in our models are near the density threshold for detonation of the helium layer, where an increase in the density at ignition due to the 3 α rate may be important.

40|$|Hydrogen and/or helium accreted by {{a neutron}} star from a binary {{companion}} may undergo thermonuclear fusion. At different mass accretion rates different burning regimes are discerned. Theoretical models predict helium fusion to proceed as a thermonuclear <b>runaway</b> for accretion <b>rates</b> below the Eddington limit and as stable burning above this limit. Observations, however, place the boundary close to 10 % of the Eddington limit. We study the effect of rotationally induced transport processes on the stability of helium burning. For the first time detailed calculations of thin helium shell burning on neutron stars are performed using a hydrodynamic stellar evolution code including rotation and rotationally induced magnetic fields. We find that {{in most cases the}} instabilities from the magnetic field provide the dominant contribution to the chemical mixing, while Eddington-Sweet circulations become important at high rotation rates. As helium is diffused to greater depths, the stability of the burning is increased, such that the critical accretion rate for stable helium burning is found to be lower. Combined with a higher heat flux from the crust, as suggested by recent studies, turbulent mixing could explain the observed critical accretion rate. Furthermore, close to this boundary we find oscillatory burning, which previous studies have linked to mHz QPOs. In models where we continuously lower the heat flux from the crust, the period of the oscillations increases by up to several tens of percents, similar to the observed frequency drift, suggesting that this drift could be caused by the cooling of deeper layers.

40|$|Chemical {{processes}} can undergo to thermal <b>runaway</b> if the <b>rate</b> of {{heat generation}} is {{faster than the}} rate of heat removal by cooling system, thus leading to a continuous rise in the reactor temperature and a consequent acceleration of the reactions, leading eventually to explosion. This phenomenon needs to be investigated in the chemistry of peroxides, in particular for epoxidation reactions, when the passage from lab-scale to industrial scale is under investigation. Among others, the epoxidation reaction of vegetable oil is particularly interesting for industrial use. Oil epoxidation is carried out by Prileshajew’s reaction, where the oil double bonds are reacted with organic peroxyacids (generally performic or peracetic) produced in situ in the reaction vessel by acid catalyzed oxidation of the corresponding organic acid with hydrogen peroxide. The reaction is highly exothermic (Hr ≈ 230 kJ/mol of double bond of the unsaturated substrate) and decomposition reactions are likely. The scope of this work is the safety analysis for the occurrence of the runway reactions in the epoxidation of soybean oil in a semi-continuous fed-batch reactor (the classical technology) [Santacesaria et al., 2011] and in a new continuous reactor configuration proposed in previous works [Kralisch et al, 2012; Santacesaria et al, 2012]. To this aim, the initial temperature in the reaction vessel and in the jacket and the operating conditions (flow rate of the mixture of hydrogen peroxide and formic acid) have been purposely varied and compared with the data produced by the existing thermo-kinetic model [Salzano et al., 2012]. Ultimately, results are addressed to the recognition of the optimum between maximum yield and safety operations for semi-batch and continuous reactor...|$|R
40|$|Nuclear fusion in tokamaks is a {{possible}} future energy production mechanism. Some of the still unsolved problems {{are connected to the}} effect of magnetic perturbations on the radial plasma transport. Two such problems are addressed in this thesis. The sudden loss of plasma confinement in large tokamaks can lead to the generation of a relativistic runaway electron beam that may cause serious structural damage. To suppress the runaway beam the application of resonant magnetic perturbations (RMP) has been suggested. The numerical analysis of the RMP is based on the relativistic, gyro-averaged drift equations for the runaway electrons in the 3 D perturbed equilibria of the TEXTOR and ITER tokamaks. The simulations include a time-dependent electric field, radiation losses and collisions. The simulated <b>runaway</b> current damping <b>rate</b> agrees with experimental observations at TEXTOR. The results indicate that, in a properly chosen perturbation geometry, runaway electrons are rapidly lost from regions where the normalised magnetic perturbation amplitude is larger than 0. 1 %. This applies in both machines roughly to the outer third - outer half of the confinement value. The second part of the thesis describes the low frequency precursor activity observed in the ASDEX Upgrade tokamak before sawtooth crashes. Sawtooth crashes are periodic density and temperature redistributions of the plasma core. Besides the well-known internal kink mode, the low frequency sawtooth precursor (LFSP) mode is studied in detail. Power modulation of the LFSP is found to correlate with the power modulation of the kink mode in the quasi-stationary intervals indicating possible non-linear interaction. In all the studied sawtooth crashes, the power of the lower frequency mode rose by several orders of magnitude just before the crash. The spatial structure of the LFSP was estimated and found to equal that of the kink mode. A possible role of this mode in the mechanism of the sawtooth crash is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Direct Electric Heating (DEH) {{is applied}} to subsea oil {{production}} and transmission pipelines to prevent freezing of hydrates as wax during productions shut downs. To prevent clogging, the pipes are heated by application of alternating current (AC) voltage. As a result, a risk for AC corrosion is introduced, which is the motivation and subject of this thesis. The steel pipes are coated and applied conventional cathodic protection (CP) by use of AlZnIn sacrificial anodes. The present work focused on the risk of increased rates of AC influenced corrosion of the AlZnIn anodes. Anode samples coupled to steel samples were investigated under applied AC by use of laboratory scale test cells in synthetic seawater at room temperature. In these experiments, which lasted for one week, the applied AC was varied in the range 0. 5 to 150 A m- 2, and the anode-steel area ratio (AR) was set to either 10 : 1 or 100 : 1. Corrosion rates were assessed by weight loss measurements and properties of surface deposits and corroded surfaces were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. For better assessment of anode-steel coupling in practice and the significance of anode-steel area, similar tests were performed by using a connection of two identical pairs of parallel-coupled anode-steel, with area ratio of 100 : 1. Equipment and methodology for investigation of AC corrosion were developed and evaluated. Results show that the anode corrosion rate increased with increasing applied AC level, while steel is sufficiently protected under the experimental conditions specified above. Anode corrosion rate was influenced both by current provided {{for the protection of}} the steel and self-corrosion and the attack was characterized by pit formation and coalescence of these at higher AC levels. High self-corrosion rates were attributed to successive alkalization, explained by hydrogen evolution, and acidification of the anode surface at each AC cycle, which destabilized the protective oxide layer. Corrosion was limited at high AC levels, explained by hydrogen blanketing of the anode surface and by hydrogen trapped within pores of the hydroxide surface film. AC corrosion of the anodes depended strongly on the anode-steel area ratio. In experiments with electrode pair configuration as described above, the significance of the steel samples vanished by increasing the anode-steel area ratio to 100 : 1. The system functioned as an anode?anode galvanic couple, which caused a significant decrease in the potential of the anodes, giving rise to <b>runaway</b> self-corrosion <b>rates.</b> In experiments with one anode-steel couple, the couple potential also decreased once AC was applied, increasingly in extent with applied AC potential. This further increased the current requirement by increasingly cathodic steel, thereby resulting in extreme anode corrosion at high AC levels in experiments with AR of 10 : 1. A subsequent positive shift in the couple potential to a stable level lower than the DC operation potential (- 1. 05 VSCE) of the AlZnIn anode was observed within 20 hours, caused by hydrogen evolution on steel. The time until the positive shift increased with applied AC level and decreased AR. Formation of calcareous deposits on the steel surface under DC conditions is an important aspect of CP in seawater because the deposits reduce the current requirement significantly. Such deposits did not appear to have a similar significance in the presence of applied AC. Increased water reduction by AC, causing pH increase on the steel surface higher than the DC case, reduced the protectiveness of the deposits by inhibition of electrically insulating CaCO 3 formation. Preconditioning of the steel surface by CP under usual DC conditions to form the desired deposits did not have a clear influence on the AC corrosion of anodes. The decrease of both the AC and DC components of the cell current as a function of time under moderate applied AC levels, however, indicated the formation of calcareous deposits on steel. No calcareous scales were found to deposit on the anode surface. The decrease of cell current with time can also be attributed to the development of corrosion products on the anode surface. Decrease in the cell current was not appreciable for high AC levels (> 2 V RMS) with an AR of 10 : 1, explained by the destruction and instability of the calcareous deposits due to vigorous gas evolution. In conclusion, these results suggest that the lifetime of the CP system at high levels of applied AC (V(AC) > 2 V AC or iAC > 30 A m- 2) may become significantly reduced in relation to the expected lifetime under DC conditions. </p...|$|R
40|$|Novae are violent explosions {{occurring}} on {{the surface}} of a white dwarf accreting material from a close companion, in binary stellar systems called cataclysmic variables. Hydrogen-rich gas from the donor star accretes onto and mixes within the envelope of an electron degenerate star, a white dwarf (WD). With increasing pressure and temperature, a threshold can be reached at which proton capture on CNO nuclei ignites a thermonuclear reaction. This release of energy increases the temperature but, because of the degenerate environment, the pressure is not altered by expansion fro the overpressure. Eventually a thermonuclear <b>runaway</b> occurs, reaction <b>rates</b> go out of equilibrium, the envelope expands and the explosion throttles and stalls. Due to high temperature gradients, convective macro-scale motions mix the expanding envelope with the superficial layers of the WD. Expansion is finally driven by beta-unstable nuclides, mainly CNO isotopes. The photometric and spectroscopic evolution of the outburst is determined by the physical conditions and dynamics of the ejected envelope. Initially completely ionized and opaque, the freely expanding gas is continuously irradiated by the central hot WD: the luminosity finally reaches the Eddington limit. Once recombination becomes efficient, line absorption from metals becomes the main opacity source. The envelope steadily rarefies, eventually turning transparent, showing broad (~ 10 ^ 3 km s^(- 1)) emission lines profiles. Although these explosions release several orders of magnitude less energy (mass) than supernovae, the physical processes taking place deserve full attention. The complete modeling and comprehension of the outburst is a difficult task given the relevant number of parameters involved (the detailed properties of the WD and its companion, the orbital parameters of the system etc), and computational limits on three-dimensional models. However, with panchromatic high-cadence observations it is possible to build a solid evolutionary model for the outburst. Among the hundreds (and counting) known novae in the Milky Way, only 10 are known to be recurrent: these novae have displayed two or more outbursts in the last ~ 150 years. One of these systems, T Pyxidis, which sixth historical outburst occurred in April 2011, has been studied for this thesis. The analysis follows the evolutionary path of the nova from the early stage of the outburst to the late nebular phase (December 2012). The spectroscopic analysis suggests a bipolar geometry for the ejecta, a feature which seems omnipresent for classical and recurrent novae. The study of the interstellar medium along the line of sight has also been conducted. The WD composition is determined by the evolutionary history of the star: naively, more massive stars develop oxygen-neon rich cores, instead of carbon-nitrogen-oxygen, hence defining two subclasses, ONe and CO novae. Nova Monocerotis 2012 (V 959 Mon), a recent ONe nova, is discussed here. It is the first classical nova discovered as high-energy gamma-ray source before optical discovery. The comparison with past ONe novae strongly supports the hypothesis of a specific evolutionary sequence for these objects, perhaps also a new candidate class of cosmologically significant standard candles. The analysis for these novae has been conducted with multi-wavelength observations (from gamma-rays to infrared) and archival data for comparisons with historical analogs. The discussion concerns the hydrodynamic and evolutionary processes that are peculiar to this class of cataclysmic variables, their possible relation to supernovae Type Ia, and their importance as laboratories for processes encountered in other areas of astrophysics. The results of the analysis are discussed in the light of several aspects of the phenomenon currently under investigation, particularly radiative/dynamical processes taking place during the optically thick stage, and the maximum magnitude vs distance relation...|$|R
