5|$|As Scully {{heads to}} the other <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ready, her FBI badge falls out of her coat pocket. Scully discreetly picks it back up without Ed noticing. The tattoo begins to talk again, convincing Ed to redial Scully's last call to see who she was {{speaking}} to. An FBI operator answers and, upon learning that Scully is an FBI agent, the tattoo forces Ed to attack her. Scully tries to escape but is overpowered by Ed, who wraps her in a bedsheet and carries her {{down to the basement}} to throw her in the furnace. At the last moment, Ed is able to overpower the impulses of the tattoo and instead thrusts his own arm into the furnace.|$|E

25|$|Gus {{leaves the}} <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{a drink of}} water in the bathroom, and the dumbwaiter's {{speaking}} tube whistles (a sign that there is a person on the other end who wishes to communicate). Ben listens carefully—we gather from his replies that their victim has arrived and {{is on his way to}} the room. Ben shouts for Gus, who is still out of the room. The door that the target is supposed to enter from flies open, Ben rounds on it with his gun, and Gus enters, stripped of his jacket, waistcoat, tie and gun. There is a long silence as the two stare at each other before the curtain comes down.|$|E

60|$|When {{the dusk}} began to thicken, Mr. Salton and Sir Nathaniel walked home--the trap {{had been sent}} away early in the day--leaving Adam to follow in his own time. He came in earlier than was expected, and seemed upset about something. Neither of the elders made any comment. They all lit cigarettes, and, as dinner-time was close at hand, went <b>to</b> their <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ready.|$|R

Soon Tom was ready, and leaping {{to the end}} of the houseboat, took a {{straight}} dive into the river. Sam followed and Fred came next, and then Dick, Songbird, and Hans came down in a bunch. The water was just cold enough to be pleasant, and they splashed around in great sport.|$|R
25|$|Ram Dass befriends Sara {{when his}} pet monkey escapes into Sara's {{adjoining}} attic. After climbing {{over the roof}} to Sara's <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the monkey, Ram Dass tells Carrisford about Sara's poor living conditions. As a pleasant distraction, Carrisford and Ram Dass buy warm blankets, comfortable furniture, food, and other gifts, and secretly leave them in Sara's room when she is asleep or out. Sara's spirits and health improve due to the gifts she receives from her mysterious benefactor, whose identity she does not know; nor are Ram Dass and Carrisford aware that she is Crewe's lost daughter. When Carrisford anonymously sends Sara a package of new, well-made and expensive clothing in her proper size, Miss Minchin becomes alarmed, thinking Sara might have a wealthy relative secretly looking out for her, and begins to treat Sara better and allows her to attend classes rather than doing menial work.|$|E
500|$|When Dean {{leaves the}} <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> food, he is {{arrested by the}} police, who believe he is {{connected}} to the disappearances. At the police station, they show him John's journal, and he notices the message [...] "Dean 35-111" [...] written inside it. As Dean is interrogated, Sam tracks down Constance's husband (Steve Railsback), and learns the locations of both her grave site and the house in which she drowned their children. Sam then fakes a 911 call so Dean can escape the station. However, Constance targets Sam in his car; she attempts to seduce him and requests he take her home. Sam refuses, but she possesses the car so that it drives Sam to her home. She attacks him once they arrive at her old house. Dean forces her to temporarily dissipate by shooting her with rock salt, and Sam uses the opportunity to crash the car into the house. Constance reappears and attacks them, but the spirits of her children confront her. They embrace their mother, causing her to scream in pain as demonic like beings spawn from under her, dragging her down through the floor.|$|E
500|$|On 6 February Momolo Mortara gave {{an account}} of the case that contradicted the inquisitor's at almost every turn; in Rome, he said, Edgardo had been [...] "frightened, and intimidated by the rector's presence, [...] he openly {{declared}} his desire to return home with us". Carboni then travelled to San Giovanni in Persiceto to interrogate Morisi, who gave her age as 23 rather than the actual 26. Morisi said that Edgardo had fallen sick in the winter of 1851–52, when he was about four months old. She recounted having seen the Mortaras sitting sadly by Edgardo's crib and [...] "reading from a book in Hebrew that the Jews read when one of them is about to die". She repeated her account of giving Edgardo an emergency baptism at the instigation of the grocer Lepori and later telling the story to a neighbour's servant called Regina, adding that she had also told her sisters about the baptism. As before, Lepori denied any role in the affair whatsoever, indeed saying he could not even remember Morisi. The [...] "Regina" [...] in Morisi's story was identified as Regina Bussolari; though Morisi averred to have told her the whole story, Bussolari professed to know nothing of the case. She said that she had only spoken with Morisi [...] "once or twice, when she was going up to the storage <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something", and never about {{anything to do with the}} Mortaras' children.|$|E

50|$|In 1969, the {{regional}} government renamed the stadium, assigning it {{the name of}} Estádio do Professor Marcelo Caetano. However, the decision was not too popular with local fans and quickly fell into disuse, and was reverted to Estádio dos Barreiros. On 15 May 1977, a record crowd of 22,000 people squeezed into the stadium to see Marítimo gain promotion to the Primeira Liga for the first time. Due to the higher than capacity crowd, many spectators sat on the athletics running track and {{on the roof of}} the changing <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a view of the match.|$|R
50|$|With {{most of the}} album's instrumentals being {{produced}} in absence of the band, all vocals for the album were recorded simultaneously in two studios and control <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> all the vocals done in around eighteen days and meet the deadline. In-house studio engineers Nico Schütte and Tobias Eichelberg were consulted for recording at the Sound Studio N, with {{the first half of}} the album recorded in mid-January 2007 and the rest wrapped in late February 2007, interrupted by several promotional appearances. In the end, thirteen out of a total of sixteen fully recorded and mixed tracks made it to the final track listing.|$|R
500|$|Representatives of the ship's company {{approached}} Captain Claude Cumberlege {{to ask for}} {{a one-day}} delay on departure; this would allow the sailors to have a full weekend of leave, give Perth-born personnel the chance to visit their families, and give personnel another chance to invite people aboard. Cumberlege replied that as Australia had a tight schedule of [...] "welcome home" [...] port visits, such delays could not even be considered. The next morning, at around 10:30, between 80 and 100 sailors gathered in front of 'P' turret, some in working uniform, others who had just returned from shore leave still in libertyman rig. Cumberlege sent the executive officer to find out why the men had assembled, and on learning that they were repeating the previous day's request for a delay in departure, went down to address them. In a strict, legalistic tone, he informed the sailors that delaying Australias departure was impossible, and ordered them to disperse. The group obeyed this order, although some were vocal in their displeasure. Shortly after, Australia was ready to depart, but when the order to release the mooring lines and get underway was given, Cumberlege was informed that the stokers had abandoned the boiler rooms. After the assembly on deck, some sailors had masked themselves with black handkerchiefs, and encouraged or intimidated the stokers on duty into leaving their posts, leaving the navy's flagship stranded at the buoy, in full view of dignitaries and crowds lining the nearby wharf. The senior non-commissioned officers, along with sailors drafted from other departments, were sent to the boiler <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Australia moving, and departure from Fremantle was only delayed by an hour.|$|E

Shields gave a tearful speech, referring to the many memories she and Jackson shared and briefly joked about his famous sequin glove. She also mentioned Jackson's favorite song [...] "Smile" [...] by Charlie Chaplin, which was later sung in the memorial service by Jermaine Jackson.|$|E
2500|$|Act 3 opens as a {{deliberate}} replay of Act1, {{but this time}} with Helena at the ironing-board wearing Jimmy's Act1 red shirt. Months have passed. Jimmy is notably more pleasant to Helena than he was to Alison in Act1. She actually laughs at his jokes, {{and the three of}} them (Jimmy, Cliff, and Helena) get into a music hall comedy routine that obviously is not improvised. Cliff announces that he's decided to strike out on his own. As Jimmy leaves the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ready for a final night out for the three of them, he opens the door to find Alison, looking like death. Instead of caring for her he snaps over his shoulder [...] "Friend of yours to see you" [...] and abruptly leaves.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2012 interview, screenwriter Goddard gave {{an update}} saying, [...] "I'm in, I'm {{ready to do}} it...someone call J. J. {{and tell him to}} get moving, but because Matt and J. J. and I have been {{fortunate}} enough to be busy, it's hard syncing our schedules up. We're all very passionate about returning to that world." [...] When asked if an idea is on paper, he responded, [...] "If you asked each of us what we wanted to do, you'll get three different answers, which is how the first film was. The aesthetic of Cloverfield benefits from that. Three voices pulling it. Look, nothing would make me happier than to get the three of us in the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> started." [...] In a later interview in April of that same year, Goddard said: ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{at least}} two {{instances}} alternate takes were used: Taylor's memorable [...] "Goddamn you!" [...] line is restored to [...] "Screw you!", {{and some of the}} dialogue from the dancing sequence was lifted from another take. As Martha tells her story about punching George in the stomach in front of her father to Nick and Honey, it is heard very clearly while in the film it became distant and muffled as the camera followed George into another <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a gun. The album also ran a half-hour shorter than the movie as most pauses and long silent moments were removed. However, virtually every line remains intact. The album's cover has the four main actors on the cover and the back cover has some background information about the four actors, information about the five-month shooting schedule, some information about Albee and a brief synopsis of the film. This album is also out-of-print, was never released in any other formats, and is also highly prized among collectors.|$|E
2500|$|Without <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into {{position}} for the three divisions of the XX Corps to make flank attacks, the plan was for the 74th (Yeomanry) Division {{on the right to}} make a flank attack on the defences east of the railway before advancing to cover the right of the 60th (London) Division, during their frontal attack on the Kauwukah system towards the high ground north of Tel esh Sheria. The frontal attack by 60th (London) Division would be made by the 180th Brigade on the right and the 179th Brigade on the left each supported by an artillery group, with the 181st Brigade in divisional reserve. One brigade of the 10th (Irish) Division covered the left flank of the 179th Brigade. Then the 60th (London) Division with a brigade of the 10th (Irish) Division was to cross the railway and capture [...] of the trench line {{to the west of the}} railway, while the remaining two brigades of the 10th (Irish) Division formed corps reserve.|$|E

2500|$|Mike Judge {{once said}} in an {{interview}} that Beavis [...] "is a zero" [...] when it comes to intelligence; indeed, Beavis is often oblivious to what should be obvious. Generally submissive to Butt-Head and willing to tolerate a large amount of physical and verbal abuse, Beavis nonetheless has limits. In [...] "Murder Site", Beavis was driven to attack and nearly kill Butt-Head, who ceaselessly called him [...] "Butt-knocker", a term which Beavis resents. Beavis also stood up to Butt-Head while they were watching the video for Rancid's [...] "Nihilism": Butt-Head kept talking about it derisively, prompting Beavis to tell Butt-Head to shut up. When Butt-Head reacted with fury, ordering Beavis never again to tell him to shut up and threatening to attack him, Beavis preemptively kicked Butt-Head in the testicles, told him to shut up again, and walked out of the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> something to eat. In another episode, while the duo were watching a Bon Jovi video, Beavis claimed to like one part of the song, causing Butt-Head to slap him in disgust. After being struck a few times, Beavis kicked Butt-Head in the groin and proclaimed [...] "Bon Jovi rules!".|$|E
2500|$|At the auditions for {{the title}} role, Hitler, one terrible actor after another is {{rejected}} by Roger in summary fashion. Finally, Franz performs his own jazzy rendition of [...] "Haben Sie Gehört Das Deutsche Band?", {{at the end of}} which Max stands up and shouts, [...] "That's our Hitler!". Opening night arrives ("It's Bad Luck to Say 'Good Luck' on Opening Night"), and Franz falls down the stairs and breaks his leg. Roger is the only one who knows the part of Hitler, and he rushes to the dressing <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> ready. The curtain rises, and Max and Leo watch the theatrical disaster unfold ("Springtime for Hitler"). Unfortunately, Roger's performance is so camp and outrageous, the audience mistakes it for satire, and the show becomes the talk of the town. Back at the office, Max and Leo are near-suicidal ("Where Did We Go Right?"). Roger and Carmen come to congratulate them, only to find them fighting. Franz bursts in, waving a pistol, outraged by Roger's portrayal of his beloved Führer. Cowardly Max suggests that he shoot the actors, not the producers. The police hear the commotion and arrest Franz, who breaks his other leg trying to escape. They also arrest Max and take the accounting books. Leo hides; Ulla finds him and persuades him to take the two million dollars and run off to Rio with her.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete came rushing in from the other <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him off of me. But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E
50|$|Bruce Rickard {{was born}} in Roseville on 1 December 1929 to Arthur Lancelot Rickard and his wife Myfanwy. He studied at Sydney Technical College in 1947, whilst working for his uncle, Ruskin Rowe at the Sydney Ancher 1949 to 1953. His work has been said to be heavily {{influenced}} by Frank Lloyd Wright. Rickard believed {{this was due to}} the use of the same principles that Frank Lloyd Wright espoused. The main principle being space, its creation and manipulation horizontally and vertically. This was shown overlapping <b>rooms</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> more space as opposed to lining walls and creating rectangular spaces. It was not until Rickard moved to the United States in 1954 that he embraced the American architect's principles fully. Rickard died on 22 September 2010 of non-hodgkin's lymphoma.|$|R

2500|$|At an FCW house show on October 21, Ambrose {{challenged}} WWE wrestler CM Punk, who {{was making}} a guest appearance, to a match in which Ambrose was defeated in a 30-minute match, but was later paid tribute to by Punk. Ambrose's behind-the-back attack on WWE wrestler and FCW commentator William Regal set up a match between the two on the November 6 episode of FCW, where Regal pinned Ambrose to win the match. Following the loss to Regal, Ambrose became obsessed about wanting a rematch and regularly taunted Regal by using Regal's finishing moves to win matches. Ambrose started appearing at WWE house shows in December 2011. At WrestleMania XXVIII Axxess in April 2012, Ambrose had a confrontation with veteran hardcore wrestler Mick Foley, claiming that Foley needed {{to be held accountable}} for leading a generation astray. Ambrose continued his verbal assault on Foley through Twitter and WWE reacted by [...] "sending Ambrose home" [...] from the SmackDown taping. Ambrose challenged old nemesis Seth Rollins for the FCW Florida Heavyweight Championship on the June 24 episode of FCW, but Rollins defeated him. Ambrose finally received a rematch with Regal on the final episode of FCW on July 15, which ended in a no contest when Ambrose kneed Regal's head into an exposed turnbuckle, causing Regal to bleed from the ear, but after the match nonetheless applauded Ambrose and allowed him to deliver a running knee lift, which prompted the FCW locker <b>room</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> in the ring to separate Ambrose from a fallen Regal while commentators questioned whether Regal would ever be able to wrestle again.|$|E
