40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} big data analytics for understanding the Rolling Contact Fatigue (RCF) phenomena at the High Speed Line (HSL Zuid) in The Netherlands. The authors developed a data model to investigate the impacting parameters in train-track interaction. This {{has been done to}} gain more insight about the circumstances under which RCF occurs and to conclude why some track sections are severely affected and others not. To evaluate the worst affected areas by RCF, the methodology proposes a bottom-up approach. By focusing on the worst affected sections with RCF, a set of characteristic parameter values are defined to describe different types of hotspots. Then, a comparison between the hotspots is performed. The methodology has been applied using real-life data of the Dutch High-speed line, where certain sections had been heavily affected by RCF. Findings concluded that slow <b>running</b> traffic <b>through</b> <b>curves</b> on a highspeed line is likely to contribute to the appearance of RCF.

500|$|Here, {{the route}} turns {{northwest}} and crosses under Norfolk Southern's Morrisville Line and the Pennsylvania Turnpike (I-276) as a three-lane road with one northbound lane and two southbound lanes. Immediately after the Pennsylvania Turnpike bridge, Susquehanna Road splits {{to the northwest}} and PA152 continues north along Limekiln Pike, passing businesses in Dresher. The road becomes two lanes again and continues northwest <b>through</b> residential neighborhoods, <b>running</b> <b>through</b> Jarrettown. PA152 <b>curves</b> {{to the north and}} reaches the community of Maple Glen, where it crosses Norristown Road and PA63 (Welsh Road). At the intersection with the latter, PA152 enters Horsham Township and continues to an intersection with Butler Pike. Farther north, the route crosses the Power Line Trail.|$|R
2500|$|The trains entered {{service on}} the day express {{services}} to both Trondheim and Bergen later that year, with NSB branding the services as [...] Dovreekspressen and Bergensekspressen, respectively. They proved popular with the public, allowing for faster travel times from the capital to Norway's second and third largest cities. Due to <b>running</b> <b>through</b> scenic mountainous areas, the services were popular with tourists. However, the trains had poor driving properties, especially at higher speeds and <b>through</b> <b>curves.</b> This was partially evaded through the installation of hydraulic suspension in the bogies.|$|R
50|$|PA 94 {{begins at}} the Maryland border in West Manheim Township, York County, where the road {{continues}} south into that state as MD 30. From the state line, the route heads northwest on two-lane undivided Baltimore Pike, passing through agricultural areas with some woods and residential development and serving the communities of West Manheim and Pleasant Hill. PA 94 runs through more rural areas with residential subdivisions, turning north and heading into Penn Township. At this point, the route becomes Baltimore Street and passing a mix of residential and business development, <b>running</b> <b>through</b> Parkville and <b>curving</b> northwest again. The road enters the borough of Hanover, where it is lined with several homes. Upon reaching the commercial downtown, PA 94 comes to an intersection with PA 116 and northbound PA 194. The route becomes Carlisle Street {{at this point and}} intersects the southbound direction of PA 194 a block later. The road crosses a York Railway line and CSX's Hanover Subdivision railroad line within a short distance of each other and leaves the downtown area, heading past more residences. Farther north, PA 94 gains a center left-turn lane and passes several businesses. The route becomes the border between Penn Township to the west and Hanover to the east as it runs {{to the west of the}} North Hanover Mall. The road passes more businesses before fully entering Penn Township again and narrowing back to two lanes.|$|R

40|$|This article investigates when homotopies can be {{converted}} to monotone homotopies without increasing the lengths of curves. A monotone homotopy is one which consists of curves which are simple or constant, and in which curves are pairwise disjoint. We show that, if the boundary of a Riemannian disc can be contracted <b>through</b> <b>curves</b> of length less than $L$, then it can also be contracted monotonously <b>through</b> <b>curves</b> of length less than $L$. This proves a conjecture of Chambers and Rotman. Additionally, any sweepout of a Riemannian $ 2 $-sphere <b>through</b> <b>curves</b> of length less than $L$ can be replaced with a monotone sweepout <b>through</b> <b>curves</b> of length less than $L$. Applications of these results are also discussed. Comment: 16 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
