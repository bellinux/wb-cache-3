40|$|Abstract—To {{increase}} the data rate without signal bandwidth expansion, {{a combination of}} MC system with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) -space division multiplexing (SDM) is attractive. MIMO-SDM transmission performance is governed by min {N t, N r}, where N t and N r are the numbers of transmit and <b>receive</b> <b>antennas,</b> respectively. For downlink transmission, many <b>receive</b> <b>antennas</b> cannot be equipped at a mobile station due to space limitation. Therefore, the achievable data rate {{is limited by the}} number of <b>receive</b> <b>antennas.</b> In this paper, we propose a virtual MIMO-SDM for multi-carrier-code division multiple access (MC-CDMA) that can use the signals received via different propagation paths as virtual <b>receive</b> <b>antennas.</b> The equivalent number of <b>receive</b> <b>antennas</b> can be increased by a factor of the number of distinct paths of the channel.
