40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} the effects of aqueous extract of Allium sativum bulbs (AEASAB) on pituitary-testicular injury and dysfunction in Wistar rats with lead-induced <b>reproductive</b> <b>disturbances.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male Wistar rats were divided into 7 groups such that the control group received propylene glycol at 0. 2 ml/ 100 g intraperitoneally for 10 consecutive days, the toxic group received lead (Pb) alone at 15 mg/kg/day via intraperitoneal route for 10 days while the treatment groups were pretreated with lead as the toxic group after which they received graded doses of the extract at 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day via oral route for 28 days. RESULTS: Pb administration induced significant deleterious alterations in the antioxidant status of the brain and testis, sperm characterization (counts, motility and viability) as well as reproductive hormones (FSH, LH and testosterone) of exposed rats (p < 0. 05). These were significantly reversed in the AEASAB-treated groups (p < 0. 05). Also, there was marked improvement in the Pb-induced vascular congestion and cellular loss in the pituitary while the observed Pb-induced severe testicular vacuolation was significantly reversed in the representative photomicrographs, following administration of the extract.

Cow's health management information was also provided for decision-makers to evaluate whether to cull their cows or not. This system was written in Visual FoxPro 6. 0 programming language. The inputs include individual cow's basic information, reproductive record, mating record, health management, production record, and body condition scores. Through the calculation of the program, the working reports of heat observation, conception check, drying off, and calving were produced. The warning messages including open-day cow, heifer never mating, services too much, <b>reproductive</b> <b>disturbance,</b> disease, low fertility, and poor milk quality could also be displayed. The program also had the function of reports of herd's parity distribution, insemination repeats of different parity, reasons of re-mating, average reproductive performance of the farm, disease incidence rate, and statistic report of culling reasons. The default values of the system could be edited to meet individual farmers' requirement.

40|$|Environmental {{chemicals}} may modulate the {{endocrine system}} through interaction with plasma sex steroid-binding proteins (SBP) and SBP-regulated processes. Some of these chemicals, which {{are known to}} interact with the estrogen receptor (ER), were found to bind competitively to the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) SBP and potentially disrupt the endocrine function of these proteins. Furthermore, both weakly acting (di-n-butyl phthalate) and potent estrogen mimics (ethynylestradiol), were able to induce a substantial up-regulation of circulating levels of SBP in vivo. Interestingly, modulation of SBP-levels was found to be a more sensitive endpoint than chemically induced interference with classical ER-mediated mechanisms for weakly acting estrogen mimics like di-(n-butyl) phthalate. Interference with the endocrine function of SBPs may thus introduce a novel mechanism for endocrine disruption, and give additional answers to the question why some weakly acting xenoestrogens are causing "estrogen-like" <b>reproductive</b> <b>disturbances</b> in developing males...|$|E

In this case, fatty degeneration developed, also. The chemical analysis of the organ also resealed a high fat content. The infiltration of fat in the hepatic cells may injure the functions of either glycogenesis or glycogeneolysis which in turn may cause fluctuation in the concentration of glucose in the blood.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} dissolved inorganic nutrients in generating changes in phytoplankton community and pigment composition and if such changes can affect {{the production of the}} antioxidant astaxanthin in the ecosystem via pelagic copepods. The background of my studies is the possible relationship between eutrophication and a <b>reproductive</b> <b>disturbance</b> in Baltic populations of Atlantic salmon (M 74), which is associated with astaxanthin and thiamine deficiencies and oxidative stress. In the southern Baltic Sea, changes in nutrient loads correlate with observed trends of flagellates replacing diatoms in the phytoplankton. Copepods are the main producers of astaxanthin and a major link between phytoplankton and higher trophic levels. In laboratory and field experiments in the Baltic Sea proper and the Norwegian Sea, I show that astaxanthin synthesis in copepods is fast and depends on pigment composition of the phytoplankton diet. Among single-species diets, a diatom and a green algal cyst yielded the highest astaxanthin levels in copepods, and another diatom species, a green alga and a cyanobacterium the lowest. In nutrient-generated phytoplankton blooms in mesocosms, copepods grazing on diverse communities dominated by weakly silicified diatoms produced more astaxanthin compared with copepods grazing on communities dominated by strongly silicified diatoms. This suggests that diatoms invested in defence mechanisms and escaped grazing at surplus Si. A nutrient-starved diatom culture subjected to intraspecific competition exhibited decreased pigment levels, increased thiamine levels and increased oxidative stress. My results suggest that diatoms are beneficial for astaxanthin and thiamine production compared to other phytoplankton groups, but not under all circumstances. Copepod growth and development also responded to inorganic nutrient availability and affected total astaxanthin production per volume seawater, with highest production when the copepods grazed on diatoms. From an ecosystem perspective, increased N and P loads seem to promote high astaxanthin production, but not when diatoms disappear completely...|$|R

In women with the polycystic ovary syndrome, abdominal obesity may be co-responsible for the development of hyperandrogenism and associated chronic anovulation, through mechanisms primarily involving the insulin-mediated overstimulation of ovarian steroidogenesis and decreased sex hormonebinding globulin blood concentrations. By these mechanisms, obesity may also favour resistance to clomiphene and gonadotrophin-induced ovulation and reduce outcomes of IVF/ICSI procedures.

Investigations were conducted on a total of 181 cows originating from three different dairy farms. Blood and cervical mucus samples for laboratory analyses were collected on the day of the last artificial insemination. Presence of ASA was determined by indirect immunofluorescence method (IIF) using bulls' sperm cells prepared for artificial insemination by suspending in TRIS - egg yolk or "Biociphos + " extenders prior to deep freezing. Our results strongly confirm the hypothesis that immune mechanisms may be involved in <b>reproductive</b> <b>disturbances</b> due to high levels of ASA of lg A class. In the sera and cervical mucus of cows, high levels of ASA were found in animals with longer open days period. In this study we were not able to demonstrate differences in ASA titers when sperm cells were suspended in different extenders and used for the IIF test...|$|E
40|$|Anthropogenic {{chemicals}} in the aquatic environment are known to cause <b>reproductive</b> <b>disturbances</b> in vertebrate and invertebrate organisms by interfering with the endocrine systems. Large efforts have recently been devoted to dissect the mechanisms of action of xenobiotics in aquatic species, with the ultimate aim of detecting and controlling the effects of chemical exposure on the aquatic ecosystem and humans. In the present paper, males of a marine species, the black goby (Gobius niger), were treated with estrogenicand dioxin-like compounds commonly discharged into the environment from industry, agriculture, and urban waste such as nonylphenol (NP) and beta-naphthoflavone (beta-NF). Their effects were compared with those induced by estradiol (E 2), analyzing the expression of biomarkers commonly used in ecotoxicological studies such as vitellogenin (VTG) and cytochrome P 4501 A 1. The treatment with NP induced the synthesis of the female specific protein VTG in males, showing its estrogenic activity. NP and E 2 lowered cytochrome P 4501 A 1 basal levels while beta-NF determined a significant rise of its expression. The detoxification pathway was investigated,and the most relevant finding {{of this paper was}} the evidence that cytochrome P 4501 A 1 inhibition by estrogen and estrogen-like compounds is mediated through the activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor repressor...|$|E
40|$|Melatonin is {{associated}} with direct or indirect actions upon female reproductive function. However, its effects on sex hormones and steroid receptors during ovulation are not clearly defined. This study aimed to verify whether exposure to long-term melatonin is able to cause <b>reproductive</b> hormonal <b>disturbances</b> {{as well as their}} role on sex steroid receptors in the rat ovary, oviduct and uterus during ovulation. Twenty-four adult Wistar rats, 60 days old (+/- 250 g) were randomly divided into two groups. Control group (Co) : received 0. 9 % NaCl 0. 3 mL+ 95 % ethanol 0. 04 mL as vehicle; Melatonin-treated group (MEL) : received vehicle+melatonin [100 μg/ 100 g BW/day] both intraperitoneally during 60 days. All animals were euthanized by decapitation during the morning estrus at 4 a. m. Melatonin significantly reduced the plasma levels of LH and 17 beta-estradiol, while urinary 6 -sulfatoximelatonin (STM) was increased at the morning estrus. In addition, melatonin promoted differential regulation of the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR) and melatonin receptor (MTR) along the reproductive tissues. In ovary, melatonin induced a down-regulation of ER-alpha and PRB levels. Conversely, it was observed that PRA and MT 1 R were up-regulated. In oviduct, AR and ER-alpha levels were down-regulated, in contrast to high expression of both PRA and PRB. Finally, the ER-beta and PRB levels were down-regulated in uterus tissue and only MT 1 R was up-regulated. We suggest that melatonin partially suppress the hypothalamus-pituitary-ovarian axis, in addition, it induces differential regulation of sex steroid receptors in the ovary, oviduct and uterus during ovulation...|$|R

30|$|Changes in the {{proportion}} of lichens with different <b>reproductive</b> modes following <b>disturbance</b> also has implications for colonization and persistence under a re-established burning regime. Previous research has indicated lichen soredia, which are small vegetative reproductive structures composed of fungal hyphae and algae (Brodo et al. 2001), are an effective dispersal mechanism for colonizing recently burned habitats (Eversman and Horton 2004). Over half of the lichens collected in this study primarily reproduce asexually through the dispersal of soredia or other specialized vegetative propagules. In contrast, the colonization of canopy branches by sexual species present in adjacent forest blocks might be expected considering the increased dispersal abilities of small fungal diaspores, such as ascospores, compared to relatively much larger asexual diaspores (Löbel et al. 2009, Wagner et al. 2006, Werth et al. 2006, Johansson et al. 2012, Lendemer et al. 2014). Our findings related to possible changes in the reproductive mode favored by lichens following thinning and burning were ambiguous (Figure 6, bottom panel), yet trended with the idea that a vegetative dispersal mechanism might dominate, at least over the short term.|$|R
