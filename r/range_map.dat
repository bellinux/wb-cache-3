40|$|We {{present a}} very fast and simple-to-implement {{algorithm}} for the automatic registration {{of a large number}} of <b>range</b> <b>maps.</b> The proposed algorithm exploits a compact and GPU-friendly descriptor specifically designed for the alignment of this type of data. This pairwise registration algorithm, which also includes a simple mechanism to avoid to get false positives, is part of a system capable to align a sequence of up to hundreds of <b>range</b> <b>maps</b> in few minutes. In order to reduce the number of pairs to align in the case of unordered <b>range</b> <b>maps</b> we use a prioritization strategy based on the fast computation of the correlation between <b>range</b> <b>maps</b> through FFT. The proposed system does not need any user input and it was tested successfully on a large variety of datasets coming from real acquisition campaigns...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} modeling the surface of an object from a sequence of <b>range</b> <b>maps.</b> Our method {{is based on a}} volumetric approach that produces a compact surface without boundary. It provides robustness through the use of interval analysis techniques and computational efficiency through hierarchical processing using octrees. 1. Introduction Surface reconstruction from range data involves four major steps. Step 1 : Data acquisition. Range data sets covering the surface to be modeled are obtained. Some preprocessing of the data may be required, such as lowpass filtering and removal of data points that belong to other objects or background. Step 2 : Registration. In general, each range view is in its own coordinate system. The collection of views (<b>range</b> <b>maps)</b> are registered into a common objectcentered coordinate system. Step 3 : Integration. The separate registered <b>range</b> <b>maps</b> are integrated into a single surface representation (often a polygon mesh). Step 4 : Optimization. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Time-of-Flight matrix sensors {{currently}} available {{allow for the}} acquisition of <b>range</b> <b>maps</b> at video rate but usually have a limited resolution. At the same time high resolution color cameras are widely available. This makes highly desirable methods {{that are able to}} exploit the combined use of ToF sensors and color cameras to obtain high resolution <b>range</b> <b>maps.</b> This work presents a novel interpolation technique that exploits side information from a standard color camera to increase the resolution of <b>range</b> <b>maps.</b> A segmented version of the high resolution color image is used in order to identify the main objects in the scene, while a novel surface prediction scheme is used to interpolate the available depth samples. Critical issues like the joint calibration of the two devices and the unreliability of the acquired data have also been taken into account with ad- hoc solutions. The performance of the proposed scheme has been verified with both synthetic and real-world data and experimental results have shown how the proposed method allows to obtain a more accurate interpolation with sharper edges if compared with standard approaches...|$|R

The presented weighting schemes allow to cope with some of the various issues that usually arise during the integration of point clouds composed by set of <b>range</b> <b>maps,</b> like tangible alignment errors, anisotropic error on sensor data and sensible difference in sampling quality...|$|R

40|$|RW was {{supported}} by a Marie Curie International Incoming Fellowship within the 7 th European Community Framework Programme FP 7 -PEOPLE- 2009 -IIFDespite lessons from terrestrial systems, conservation efforts in marine systems continue to focus on identifying priority sites for protection based on high species richness inferred from <b>range</b> <b>maps.</b> <b>Range</b> <b>maps</b> oversimplify spatial variability in animal distributions by assuming uniform distribution within range and de facto giving equal weight to critical and marginal habitats. We used Marxan ver. 2. 43 to compare species richness-based systematic reserve network solutions using information about marine mammal range and relative abundance. At a global scale, reserve network solutions were strongly sensitive to model inputs and assumptions. Solutions based on different input data overlapped by a third at most, with agreement as low as 10 % in some cases. At a regional scale, species richness was inversely related to density, such that species richness hotspots excluded highest-density areas for all species. Based on these findings, we caution that species-richness estimates derived from <b>range</b> <b>maps</b> and used as input in conservation planning exercises may inadvertently lead to protection of largely marginal habitat.
