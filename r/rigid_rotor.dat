25|$|The Lockheed CL-475 (registration N6940C) is a two-seat, single-engine, light {{helicopter}} {{developed by}} Lockheed to explore <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> technology. The CL-475 has a three-bladed main rotor and a two-bladed tail rotor. Only one was built.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} at Burbank, the CL-475 {{was taken}} to Rosamond Lake on Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert for testing. It was first flown on 2 November 1959, but the pilot reported severe vibrations. For six months, Lockheed experimented with three and four-bladed wooden rotors, but stability was finally achieved by using metal blades in a three-blade configuration {{and the addition of}} a gyroscopic control ring connected directly to the swashplate. In the mid-1960s, the helicopter was test flown by a number of government and military agencies and the military. The stability offered by the <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> control system made the helicopter easy to fly, and the lessons learned from the CL-475 <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> were later used to develop the XH-51 and AH-56A Cheyenne.|$|E

25|$|The BK 117 was a joint {{development}} between MBB and Kawasaki {{based on an}} agreement made on 25 February 1977. The agreement would replace two separate projects for twin-engined general purpose helicopters; the Bo 107 by MBB and the KH-7 from Kawasaki. Costs were shared equally, with MBB developing the rotors (based on the <b>rigid</b> <b>rotor</b> system used on MBB's Bo 105), tailboom, flight controls and hydraulic system and Kawasaki developing the landing gear, airframe, main transmission and other minor components. Each company would have its own assembly line producing aircraft for local markets.|$|E
500|$|After the cancellation, the Army {{conducted}} {{an evaluation of}} the seventh Cheyenne equipped with the AMCS flight control system. The testing showed the AMCS removed most of the remaining control problems, improved stability, improved handling, and decreased the pilot workload. With the AMCS, the Cheyenne reached a speed of 215kn (247mph, 398km/h) in level flight and in a dive achieved 245kn (282mph, 454km/h); it also demonstrated improved maneuverability at high speeds. Prototype #7 was the last Cheyenne to fly.
