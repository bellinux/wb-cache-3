Typical of such applications are <b>real</b> <b>time</b> <b>streaming</b> <b>protocols</b> which can use different coding rates. The end-systems probe the network with sample traffic to determine congestion, and decide at what rate to enter according to the fate of their “probe ” packets. During the lifetime of a connection, the procedure is repeated to reassess and possibly readjust the rate. We derive analytic models, based on diffusion limits under a natural scaling, to quantify the benefits of in-call probing. We then use simulation to compare the results in a number of scenarios, and show that this simple theory is remarkably accurate in predicting large-scale behaviour. The results also show that a small amount of in-call probing produces significant benefits to the system...|$|R

Existing specifications in stream modelling languages lack compatibility and adoption. We describe a design approach where specifications are captured in UML 2. 0, then automatically translated into SystemC models consisting of simulators and synthesizable code under proper style constraints. As an application case of the approach, we explain new UML 2. 0 notations and use them for <b>real</b> <b>time</b> <b>stream</b> processor specifications. The trace of the execution of UML models of stream processors is given to illustrate verifications at early stage of design flow. Then we expound how our translator generates SystemC models from UML models. The generated SystemC code is acceptable to further synthesis processes.
