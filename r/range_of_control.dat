500|$|Bede {{says that}} these kings had {{authority}} [...] "south of the Humber", but {{the span of}} control, at least of the earlier bretwaldas, likely was less than this. [...] In Ceawlin's case the <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> is hard to determine accurately, but Bede's inclusion of Ceawlin {{in the list of}} kings who held imperium, and the list of battles he is recorded as having won, indicate an energetic and successful leader who, from a base in the upper Thames valley, dominated much of the surrounding area and held overlordship over the southern Britons for some period. [...] Despite Ceawlin's military successes, the northern conquests he made could not always be retained: Mercia took much of the upper Thames valley, and the north-eastern towns won in 571 were among territory subsequently under the control of Kent and Mercia at different times.|$|E

40|$|In the paper, {{we study}} {{management}} control from the Simons’ four levers <b>of</b> <b>control</b> framework point <b>of</b> view (i. e. diagnostic control systems, interactive control systems, beliefs systems, and boundary systems).

The paper looks at tensions and balances between different styles of use of formal MCS, as well as between different types <b>of</b> <b>control</b> systems (e. g. formal vs. informal). The study’s contribution is that it incorporates a wider <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls,</b> including informal (i. e. social) mechanisms, to provide a more comprehensive analysis, as opposed to the majority of prior studies focusing on a more limited <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>controls...</b>|$|R

50|$|C. monilifera is {{potentially}} susceptible to a <b>range</b> <b>of</b> <b>control</b> strategies, however Burgman and Lindenmayer {{recommended that the}} strategy chosen be responsive to the local situation and available resources. Due to its relatively shallow root system removal by hand is an ideal method of control. Where manual removal is impractical many common herbicides can be used, {{in which case the}} herbicide is commonly applied directly to the wood of the plant via a cut notch or {{at the end of a}} pruned stump. Mechanical removal of C. monilifera by tractor or other machinery can also be effective, however this can be extremely indiscriminate and is only recommended in areas of poor environmental values and minimal erosion risk.|$|E
