As first steps, the city helped property owners disconnect their <b>roof</b> <b>drains</b> from sewer lines, built separate storm sewers in some locations, diverted surface streams away from the combined sewers, and added sumps and other devices to control surges of stormwater.

5000|$|All roofs {{should be}} {{inspected}} semi-annually and after major storms. Particular {{attention should be}} paid to the flashings around all of the rooftop penetrations. The sharp bends at such places can open up and need to be sealed with plastic cement, mesh and a small mason's trowel. Additionally, repairs to lap seams in the base flashings should be made. 90% of all roof leaks and failure occur at the flashings. Another important maintenance item, often neglected, is to simply keep the roof drains free of debris. A clogged <b>roof</b> <b>drain</b> will cause water to pond, leading to increased [...] "dead load" [...] weight on building that may not be engineered to accommodate that weight. Additionally, ponding water on a roof can freeze. Often, water finds its way into a flashing seam and freezes, weakening the seam.|$|E
5000|$|...A {{significant}} amount of corrosion of fences is due to landscaper tools scratching fence coatings and irrigation sprinklers spraying these damaged fences.

Even the location where your <b>roof</b> <b>drain</b> splashes down can matter. Drainage from a home’s roof valley can fall directly down onto a gas meter causing it’s piping to corrode at an accelerated rate reaching 50% wall thickness within 4 years.

50|$|The system dropped heavy {{rainfall}} in Cuba, peaking at 8.25 {{in in the}} Havana Province. While the precursor crossed Florida, it produced torrential rainfall across southern Florida, especially in the Miami metropolitan area. In Miami-Dade County alone, 1,005 houses were destroyed, 1,358 were severely damaged, and 3,443 had minor damage. Throughout the state, at least 93,000 homes were flooded. Electrical stations were also damaged by floods, leaving more than 27,000 people without power. Extensive agricultural damage occurred, with 40,000 acres (160 km²) of farmland inundated by water. Overall, the precursor system of Leslie resulted in about $950 million (2000 USD) in damage, {{slightly more than half}} of that figure was agriculture related. Additionally, three fatalities occurred, two of which due to drowning, while the third was a man that fell while attempting to unclog a <b>roof</b> <b>drain.</b> The remnants of Leslie caused near tropical storm force winds and waves up to 16 ft in Newfoundland, though damage in the region was minimal.|$|E
5000|$|Water {{entering}} sanitary sewers from inappropriate connections {{is called}} inflow. [...] Typical sources include sump pumps, <b>roof</b> <b>drains,</b> cellar drains, and yard drains where urban features prevent surface runoff, and storm drains are not conveniently accessible or identifiable. Inflow tends to peak during precipitation events, and causes greater flow variation than infiltration. Peak flows caused by inflow may generate a foul flush of accumulated biofilm and sanitary solids scoured from the dry weather wetted perimeter of oversized sewers during peak flow turbulence. Sources of inflow {{can sometimes be}} identified by smoke testing. Smoke is blown into the sewer during dry weather while observers watch for smoke emerging from yards, cellars, or roof gutters.|$|R

50|$|The use of {{asbestos}} to manufacture transite was phased out in the 1980s. Previously transite was made of cement, with varying amounts (12-50%) {{of asbestos}} fiber to provide tensile strength (similar to the steel in reinforced concrete), and other materials. It was frequently used for such purposes as furnace flues, roof shingles, siding, soffit and fascia panels, and wallboard for areas where fire retardancy is particularly important. It was also used in walk-in coolers made in large supermarkets in the 1960s, 1970s and even the 1980s. Other uses included <b>roof</b> <b>drain</b> piping, water piping, sanitary sewer drain piping, laboratory fume hood panels, ceiling tiles, landscape edging, and HVAC ducts. Because cutting, breaking, and machining asbestos-containing transite releases carcinogenic asbestos fibers into the air, its use has fallen out of favor. Despite asbestos-containing transite being phased out, {{it is still not}} banned in the United States; some 230,000 deaths have been attributed to it. Demolition of older buildings containing transite materials, particularly siding made from transite requires special precautions and disposal techniques to protect workers and the public. Finding and safely handling asbestos-containing transite is dangerous and difficult and should only be done by an asbestos abatement professional.|$|E

5000|$|General {{flat roof}} {{maintenance}} [...] includes {{getting rid of}} ponding water, typically within 48 hours. This is accomplished by adding <b>roof</b> <b>drains</b> or scuppers for a pond at an edge or automatic siphons for ponds {{in the center of}} roofs. An automatic siphon can be created with an inverted ring-shaped sprinkler, a garden hose, a wet/dry vacuum, a check valve installed in the vacuum, and a digital timer. The timer runs {{two or three times a}} day for a minute or two to start water in the hose. The timer then turns off the vacuum, but the weight of water in the hose continues the siphon and soon opens the check valve in the vacuum. The best time to address the issue of ponding water is during the design phase of a new roofing project when sufficient falls can be designed-in to take standing water away. The quicker the water is got off the roof, the less chance there is for a roof leak to occur.|$|R

Mechanical systems include piping, boilers, HVAC systems, and ducts.Mechanical insulation is commonly installed in industrial and commercial facilities. Industrial facilities are not open to the public and include power plants, oil refineries, manufacturing buildings, storage buildings, paper mills, pharmaceuticals, chemical plants, food processing plants, waste water and water treatment plants, petrochemical, auto manufacturing, and plastics manufacturing. In an industrial facility, insulation is required for systems that carry or store liquid, gas, air, or product in which the temperature of the substance being transferred or stored is impacted by the temperature of the ambient air. These systems must be insulated to maintain process temperatures for both cold and hot systems; to protect liquids from freezing; to provide burn protection for personnel from possible exposure to hot systems; and for sound attenuation.Commercial buildings include any facility that accepts the public or is used by a company for employees in a non-industrial or manufacturing setting. Mechanical insulation represents 1 to 2 percent of the total cost for a new commercial facility.

5000|$|Aitkin High School was {{established}} in the year 1894 and the oldest school building was completed in 1901. Many additions {{have been added to the}} school since. When the school was first built, many children that lived outside the city of Aitkin attended local country schools, and then attended AHS after they graduated from 8th grade. At that time, Aitkin High School served grades 9-12 only. In 1928, an addition to the school was built and it became a 7-12 school, even though many students were in country, primary and parochial schools (particularly Catholic) until 8th grade. Several modifications took place during the following decades, including a new cafeteria, band area, and auditorium. The old gym and auditorium was created in a 1941 project and the west wing was added in the 1950s. The most major change after 1928 took place in 1976, when the school was remodeled and the old school building was demolished. The west wing still remains. Not many major modifications took place after that until the year 2000, when a new band area {{was established}}. The 1941 auditorium was remodeled in 1994 while keeping most of the classic features. In 2005, a new weight room was built. The school was modified once again in 2006 with a newly added commons area, in the 9th grade locker area, and a new 7th grade locker area built on the second floor of the school, along with an LED sign in the front of the building. In 2007, a more advanced security system was installed and a speed limit regulation was implemented around the school. In 2008, a wall was removed in the cafeteria which will enable more students to have lunch in one lunch period, and signs were posted on all entrances of the school. Paintings by students were placed on the walls to give it a more friendly atmosphere. A new student parking lot was added to the school in 2009. Pavement was planned to take place in Summer 2010 but never occurred.In circa late 2014 to early 2015, plans for remodeling the high school were considered once again. Some of the plans include an expansion of the new gym area and an addition for collaborative learning/special education program, along with a few other minor updates and modifications. The plans were voted down in a county wide election on January 6, 2015, although alternative plans are still being contemplated. Some plans include minor remodeling projects along with the possibility to building a brand new school. In July 2015, reports of 1.75 inches of rain fell early Sunday morning, July 12, in Aitkin and nearly three more inches fell during the evening during an outbreak of severe thunderstorms that brought widespread damage throughout Central Minnesota, which includes the Brainerd Lakes Area and the Aitkin area.According to Aitkin Superintendent Bernie Novak and head of maintenance, Jim Bright, the weight of the water on the high school roof caused a rubber membrane around a drain to tear, creating an 18-inch by 6 foot hole around a <b>roof</b> <b>drain.</b> Large amounts of water on the roof gushed through the hole into the building and through the ceilings on each of the three levels of classrooms.One-half to three-fourths of the ceiling tile were drenched with water and at one point there was as much as two inches of water on the first floor hallway. The media center along with new Macintosh computers was damaged; the first floor server room, a special education room and the third floor chemistry lab also received extensive damage. Repairs are currently taking place and despite the damages, school will start as normally scheduled.Throughout the 2015-2016 school year, a few modifications were taken place throughout the high school and the athletic fields. On September 11, 2015, the Aitkin football field was named [...] "Veterans Field" [...] in honor of local veterans with a dedication ceremony proceeding the football game. [...] New bleachers were added in the new gym as well as some other minor modifications. Debate is still taking place about the future of the high school, such as whether to continue modifications, build a new school, or leave the school as it is. On August 9, 2016, the public has voted against the referendum in a landslide.|$|E
