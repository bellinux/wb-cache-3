5|$|The castle was rebuilt in {{the late}} 16th century. A new five-storey east <b>range</b> <b>was</b> built {{into the side of}} the rock, and the {{gatehouse}} was rebuilt, this time with a permanent stone bridge. The upper part of the east <b>range</b> <b>was</b> renovated in 1622, with renaissance details and carving to door and window surrounds. Roslin suffered again from the artillery of Cromwell’s commander in Scotland, General Monck, in 1650. It was further damaged by a Reforming mob in 1688.|$|E
50|$|The Tenmile <b>Range</b> <b>is</b> a {{mountain}} <b>range</b> in U.S. state of Colorado. The <b>range</b> <b>is</b> {{an extension of}} the Mosquito <b>Range</b> which <b>is</b> part of the Rocky Mountains. The two <b>ranges</b> <b>are</b> effectively the same <b>range.</b> They <b>are</b> split only by the Continental Divide and name.

5|$|A second range stood {{along the}} north-west wall, {{and would have}} been {{connected}} to the hall range by the donjon tower. The ground floor housed a kitchen. In 1725 the <b>range</b> <b>was</b> remodelled into a two-storey house, accessed via a stone stair, and topped with the dormer windows which now form part of the gatehouse. The well in front is original, although the large stone surround is of 19th century date.|$|E
5|$|At 13.5degrees of elevation, the 30.5cm gun {{could hit}} targets out to 16,200m (17,717yards) with armor-piercing shells. After the turrets were {{improved}} to allow elevation to 16degrees, the range correspondingly increased to 20,400m (22,310yd). At {{a range of}} 12,800m (14,000yd), the L3 armor-piercing shells fired by the gun were expected to penetrate 254mm (10in) of armor plate. At 15,000m (16,000yd) {{the effectiveness of the}} shell decreased; it was able to pierce 229mm (9in)-thick plate. The range of the World War II guns was significantly greater than the guns used in World War I. With the 405kg shell at 45degrees, the guns had a maximum range of 32,000m (35,000yd). With the 415kg shell at 49.2degrees, the <b>range</b> <b>was</b> 41,300m (45,166yd), and with the lighter 250kg round at 49.1degrees, the maximum <b>range</b> <b>was</b> 51,400m (56,200yd).|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of George I, between 1703 and 1707, the South West front was extended. The south west wing was {{decorated}} in the 1780s and the north east service <b>range</b> <b>was</b> added in the early 19th century. The house contains plaster work from each of these eras.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{emplacement}} of late Pliocene lava domes, lesser activity {{continued into}} the Quaternary period (2.58 million years ago to present). Initial volcanism began on {{the summit of the}} volcano, depositing lava in and adjacent to the Level Mountain Range. This activity is indirectly dated as Pleistocene age , on the bases of the presence of subglacial and/or intraglacial deposits. Meszah Peak, the highest point of both Level Mountain and the Level Mountain <b>Range,</b> <b>was</b> volcanically active during this eruptive period.|$|E
5|$|For {{the fall}} 2015 term, UCSC offered {{admission}} to 23,022 freshmen out of 44,871 applicants, an acceptance rate of 51.3%.

5|$|In {{the case}} of ASV {{this was not a}} problem; {{aircraft}} would not approach a ship on the surface more closely than its altitude of perhaps a few thousand feet, so a longer pulse width was fine. But in the AI role, the minimum <b>range</b> <b>was</b> pre-defined by the pilot's eyesight, at 300m or less for night interception, which demanded sub-microsecond pulse widths. This proved very difficult to arrange, and ranges under 1,000feet were difficult to produce.|$|E

5|$|The B-52C's fuel {{capacity}} (and <b>range)</b> <b>was</b> increased to 41,700USgallons by adding larger 3000USgallon underwing fuel tanks. The gross weight was increased by 30,000pounds (13,605kg) to 450,000pounds. A new fire control system, the MD-9, was introduced on this model. The {{belly of the}} aircraft was painted with antiflash white paint, which was intended to reflect thermal radiation away after a nuclear detonation.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{originally}} {{comprised the}} 12th- or 13th-century hall house, which was extended in the 15th century. In the 16th century the central <b>range</b> <b>was</b> built {{to the south}} of the tower house, and new inner and outer courtyard walls were constructed. The east part of the inner courtyard wall is reduced to foundations, but the base of a round tower and a porter's lodge survive. To the west, the inner courtyard wall remains, enclosing the former service courtyard, which comprises a brewery and bakehouse, with ovens. The east <b>range</b> <b>was</b> added in the 17th century, along the south edge of the outer courtyard. The castle was originally approached from the north, with the entrance moved to the west, along with the 17th-century gate, when the Aberdour railway line was constructed in 1890.|$|E
5|$|The east <b>range</b> <b>was</b> {{located between}} the north and east towers, {{although}} only foundations remain. This was the principal range of buildings and contained a large hall above vaulted cellars. The hall had double-lancet windows, decorated with carved patterns, which were later blocked up; their outlines {{can be seen in the}} east curtain wall.|$|E

5|$|The {{ships were}} also armed with six 45cm torpedo tubes, all in above-water swivel mounts. Four tubes were {{mounted on the}} sides of the ship, another in the bow, and the last in the stern. These weapons were 5.1m (16ft9in) long and carried an 87.5kg (193lb) TNT warhead. They could be set at two speeds for {{different}} ranges. At , the torpedoes had a range of 800m (870yd). At an increased speed of , the <b>range</b> <b>was</b> reduced to 500m (550yb).|$|E
5|$|A quadrangular castle, Wressle Castle {{was laid}} out with four ranges in a square around a courtyard. At each corner was a tower, and in {{the centre of the}} east side was a five-storey gatehouse. Clockwise from north east the corner towers were named the Constable Tower (where the constable who ran the castle on a daily basis lived), the Chapel Tower, the Lord’s Tower, and the Kitchen Tower. Opposite the gatehouse, in the castle's west <b>range,</b> <b>was</b> the great hall and the Lord's Tower in the south west {{contained}} the owner's accommodation and private rooms.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the 747X program, Boeing {{continued}} to study improvements that could be made to the 747. The 747-400XQLR (Quiet Long <b>Range)</b> <b>was</b> meant to have an increased range of 7,980nmi (9,200mi, 14,800km), with improvements to boost efficiency and reduce noise. Improvements studied included raked wingtips similar to those used on the 767-400ER and a sawtooth engine nacelle for noise reduction. Although the 747-400XQLR did not move to production, many of its features were used for the 747 Advanced, which has now been launched as the 747-8.|$|E

5|$|After the lynchings {{of their}} {{prominent}} competitors, the WSGA's {{control over the}} <b>range</b> <b>was</b> undisputed, until a group of smaller ranchers led by a local cowboy named Nate Champion formed the Northern Wyoming Farmers and Stock Growers' Association (NWFSGA) {{to compete with the}} WSGA. Upon hearing this, the WSGA immediately viewed Champion's association as a threat to their hold on the stock interests. The WSGA then blacklisted members of the NWFSGA from the round-ups in order to stop their operations. However, the latter refused the orders to disband and instead publicly announced their plans to hold their own round-up in the spring of 1892.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{perquisites}} of the Times appointment were {{a company}} {{car and a}} large and splendid office at the paper's building in Printing House Square, London. Levin accepted neither; he could not drive and he hated to be isolated. He commandeered a desk in the anteroom to the editor's office, a location that kept him closely {{in touch with the}} daily affairs of the paper. It also gave him ready access to the editor, William Rees Mogg, with whom he developed a good friendship. Levin's brief was to write two columns a week (later three) on any subject that he wished. His <b>range</b> <b>was</b> prodigious; he published nine volumes of his selected journalism of which the first, Taking Sides, covered subjects as diverse as the death watch beetle, Field Marshal Montgomery, Wagner, homophobia, censorship, Eldridge Cleaver, arachniphobia, theatrical nudity, and the North Thames Gas Board.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} Aronde, Simca marketed {{different}} trim {{levels of the}} Vedette under different model names, this time with references to the grand period of baroque in French history. The basic version was called the Simca Vedette Trianon, the mid-level was the Simca Vedette Versailles and, {{at the top of}} the range, the Simca Vedette Régence. An option on all versions was a large glass moonroof that slid into the roof, called Vistadome The Vedette <b>range</b> <b>was</b> still marketed under the Ford brand in some markets, including the Netherlands and Germany, until 1956.
