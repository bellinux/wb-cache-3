Training needs of psychiatrists are addressed in postgraduate courses and the gaps in training and updating of knowledge addressed through continuing medical education programs. This study aims to look at whether the training needs of psychiatrists working in the state of Kerala are being met. Two aspects of training and practice, child and adolescent psychiatry and psychotherapy, were assessed using a questionnaire. A significant number of respondents had not received any training in either of these areas in their postgraduate training. This did not affect their practice; most respondents continued to practice psychotherapy and see child patients despite not being trained. These two areas can thus be identified as lacunae in the curriculum as well as a need which should be addressed through Continuation Medical education programs...|$|E

Through continuing education the technologists ' satisfy their requirements for recertification and/or licensure. Continuing education should provide a method to maintain competency, however, attitudes determine the success of learning outcomes. The Professional Licensing Report of 1998 states, “more licensing boards in more states than ever are requiring continuing education classes of their licensees (as cited in Duerhring and Ward, 2001, p. 2). Licensing is a means by which the state has the authority to grant an individual permission to practice within that state. In radiology technology only 34 out of 50 states require state licensing for certification within that state. In 1991, the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists stated that it would begin implementing continuing education for <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> of certificates.

The importance of this study {{lies in the fact}} that academic studies have neglected the dissatisfaction and abandonment issues. For this, we evaluated the influence of care, facilities and personal motives that lead individuals to feel dissatisfied and discontinue their physical activity. The survey was conducted in two stages in gyms of Belo Horizonte. At first, qualitative, we conducted 10 semi-structured interviews with customers who had abandoned any gym in the last 12 months. The results of this phase fostered the development of a questionnaire, with 51 questions, measured in Likert scale, about the reasons for dissatisfaction and abandonment. Subsequently, we conducted a survey through administration of the questionnaire to a non-probabilistic convenience sample, made up of 222 individuals who had also abandoned any gym in the last 12 months. As a result, we observed that the primary responsibility for dissatisfaction and abandonment were the administrative service, technical and staff, and the facilities, suggesting to fix these problems, greater customer value, flexibility in negotiating <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> and greater attention from instructors to their students, looking for meets them best and make the most pleasurable activity developed. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Objectives were to {{investigate}} the registered brand name system in selected English-speaking countries, to determine attributes of brand names (2 ̆ 2 brands 2 ̆ 2) and whether brand attributes characterize their source countries. Officials in Australia, Canada, India, Ireland, Kenya, the United Kingdom, and the United States provided data routinely recorded in registering brand names [...] identified by random numbers preselected by this author. Each brand, whether only verbal, or only design, or mixed verbal/design, was coded for several dozen characteristics: general, morphological, goods-related, and meaning-related, including, for each, official numbers and dates, registering or renewing entity, goods so branded, and any goods-related meaning. Included, if verbal, were initial letters and word length; and, if design, whether abstract or pictorial, and type if pictorial. Brand names were characterized as a long-continuing mass communication symbol system. Textile brands are omnipresent, but in the developing countries medical (and sometimes cosmetic and/or leisure) brands are more frequent than brands for the biblical necessities of food, clothing, and shelter [...] which predominate in the industrialized countries. Over time, brand verbal content has increased whereas embellishment, as in use of borders and overt design content, has decreased markedly. India ranks highest in purely design and mixed verbal/design brands, and Ireland ranks highest in purely verbal, lowest in mixed verbal/design, brands. Recent years show modest resurgence in registration of designs [...] more in brand names with verbal content than in pure designs. Yet mixed verbal/design brands, possibly expected to survive better than do purely verbal or purely design brands, {{are less likely to}} be renewed. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>registration</b> was selected as a survival measure of success. Brands with trivial (2 ̆ 2 arbitrary 2 ̆ 2) meaning or excessive (2 ̆ 2 descriptive 2 ̆ 2) meaning about the branded goods survived better than intermediate (2 ̆ 2 suggestive 2 ̆ 2) ones.

40|$|Background: The Pharmacy Board of Australia {{stipulated that}} for <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{registration}},</b> pharmacists must have accrued {{a minimum of}} 20 CPD credits over the 2010 - 11 registration years (1). Mandatory CPD is not new in Pharmacy. The UK and New Zealand have both established systems of CPD in recent years. The {{purpose of this study}} is to investigate established CPD processes in the UK and New Zealand with the view to making recommendations for the implementation of the CPD process in Australia. Objectives: To compare the acquisition and guidance on documentation of CPD credit points in Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Methodology: A comparative online search of the websites of each of the registering authorities was undertaken. Any practice standards or guidelines which relate to registration or continuing professional development were analysed and compared. Results: In New Zealand the Pharmacy Council require Pharmacists to have a minimum of 12 outcome credits over a 3 -year period for recertification (2, 3). The outcome credit related to each CPD action and is based on relevance to the pharmacist and their practice. It is graded between one, for CPD which has occasional relevance to practice and three which have considerable relevance to practice. There are examples of completed CPD recording sheets on their website (8). In the UK, The General Pharmaceutical Council require Pharmacists to make a minimum of nine CPD entries per year (4) and detailed guidance on how to record CPD activities is provided (5, 7). The Pharmacy Board of Australia divides CPD activities into three groups (6). Of the 20 credits required annually only 10 can be gained from group one activities, which is information accessed without assessment. There is only brief guidance on the recording of CPD. Discussion: The GPhC in the UK provided the most comprehensive guidance on acquisition of CPD credit points and documentation (5, 7) The Pharmacy Council of New Zealand made CPD points relevant to practice. (2, 8) The Pharmacy Board of Australia provided limited information for pharmacists on CPD activities, which may impede pharmacist participation. Information may assist in increasing pharmacists’ engagement in CPD activities. In conclusion, there is variation between the three countries in the amount and type of information provided about CPD requirements...|$|E

40|$|The {{behavioural}} therapies predominantly use {{exposure to}} feared stimuli {{in the treatment}} of anxiety disorders. However, clients frequently experience a return of fear after treatment and this may increase the likelihood of relapse occurring. Return of fear via a renewal effect is the most frequently studied source of return <b>of</b> fear. <b>Renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear occurs when the previously feared object is encountered in a context that is different to the treatment context. The present chapter reviews clinical-analogue studies that have investigated the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear. Prior research has confirmed the validity <b>of</b> <b>renewal</b> as a mechanism for the <b>renewal</b> <b>of</b> fear in high fearful and phobic individuals.
