30|$|High-severity fluid {{catalytic}} cracking (HS-FCC) is a breakthrough technology in the refining and petrochemicals industry. It allows refineries to produce petrochemicals from heavy oils by converting a low-value <b>refinery</b> <b>stream</b> into high-value products, suitable for integrated processes. The process’s main operating features are the down flow reactor system, high reaction temperature, short residence time, and high catalyst-to-oil (C/O) ratio with a modified separator system. The unique down flow reactor system in the HS-FCC process ensures plug flow without back-mixing, allowing more selectivity toward light olefins. HS-FCC produces four times more light olefins (propylene and butene) and higher octane gasoline than conventional FCC units. Since 1999, the HS-FCC has successfully passed several phases of testing with different types of feedstock at various feed capacities. The process has been proven in a 30 barrel per day (bpd) demonstration plant at Ras Tanura Refinery, Saudi Arabia. In 2011, a 3, 000 BPD HS-FCC semi-commercial plant started operating at JX Mizushima Refinery in Japan. The unit ran successfully, meeting all design objectives. A full-scale commercial unit study for a 30, 000 BPD HS-FCC plant was completed by JX and Chiyoda for HS-FCC commercialization.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFuel {{consumption}} (mf kg/h) {{was estimated}} for two hydrocarbon gasolines (BG 1 -OE and BG 2 -OE) and their ethanol blends which contain from 4 to 20 vol. % of ethanol. Fuel consumption experiments for sixteen fuel samples (5 L each), {{were conducted on}} a four cylinder, four stroke spark ignition test vehicle Sahin car, Type 1. 45, model 2001. The engine has a swept volume of 1400 c. c., a compression ratio of 8. 3 : 1 and a maximum power of 78 HP at 5500 rpm.

Six linear equations for BG 1 -ethanol blends and BG 2 -ethanol ones at the investigated rotational speeds, were developed. Fuel consumption values of {{the first set of}} gasoline-ethanol blends are lower than that of the second set.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is {{the evaluation of the}} tribological properties of automotive gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as the improvement of the latter with the addition of bio-additives and biofuels. It is listed the physicochemical and tribological properties of automotive diesel fuels, heating diesel fuels and marine diesel fuels. What is typical for diesel fuel is the distinct separation between the values of the corrected wear diameter and the values of friction across the limit of 460 κm, which is noticeable difference in gradient of the linear dependence of the variance of these two values. There were samples of marine diesel that their lubricity was inappropriate and greater than the limit of 460 micrometers. It was examined the impact of biodiesel, vegetable oils and essential oils in the middle distillates fractions of oil. The methodology used to measure gasoline lubricity is the ASTM G 133 standard test method for linearly reciprocating ball-on-flat sliding wear. Taking into account the experimental condition characteristics for the assessment of lubricity of <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> is noticed that they are characterized by worst anti-wear properties and lubricity in relation to diesel fuels. It was measured the gasoline lubricity of mixtures that emerged from the composition of the <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> and correspond to commercial gasolines. The increased wear scar diameter of the <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> contributes to larger diameter wear for the final commercial gasolines and therefore the value of the corrected wear scar diameter depends significantly from that of the constituent <b>refinery</b> <b>streams.</b> In particular, it is evident for all 36 mixtures, the wear mechanism taking place is that of the heavy adhesive wear and mild to heavy abrasive wear, and can coexist with that of the oxidative wear. The optimum addition rate is following the mixing rules that prevail in modern refineries and specifically an optimum rate of 35 % for the stream of catalytic cracking FCC unit and 26 % for the stream of catalytic reformer unit were observed. It was measured the lubricity of commercial gasolines. For sulfur content below 50 ppm and potassium content of less than 5 ppm was noticed increased wear and in particular greater than 700 κm for all commercial gasoline types. The chlorine content varies with an average of 10 ppm for commercial gasolines by potentiometric titration. The presence of chlorine is certified by elemental analysis performed by SEM. ...|$|R
40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion {{has shown}} the {{potential}} of high efficiency, emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot below future emissions regulations, and acceptable acoustic noise. Low-octane-number gasoline fuels were shown to be most suitable for this concept, with the reactivity determining the possible load range. Other researchers have used several <b>refinery</b> <b>streams,</b> which might be produced by a refinery if {{they were required to}} do so without additional investment. Some of <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> are, however, not expected to be commercially available on the short term. For the present investigation, n-butanol (BuOH) has been selected as a blend component in diesel, and is used from 50 – 100 %. The blends then have a reactivity range similar to the <b>refinery</b> <b>streams,</b> so single-cylinder engine tests for their emission and efficiency performance {{can also be used to}} determine their applicable load range. The current paper presents a summary of the performance of such BuOH-diesel blends with respect to emissions and efficiency in the Partially Premixed Combustion regime. Besides a presentation of the sensitivity to injection strategies, dilution levels and fuel pressure, emission performance is compared to upcoming legislated emission levels. The effect of the blend ratio on load ranges is shown and conventional diesel combustion benchmarks are used to show improvements in indicated efficiency. Butanol-diesel blends are shown to be a viable approach to partially premixed combustion, with its high soot reduction potential and stable operation. EURO VI emission levels can therefore be achieved, with moderate or slightly increased fuel pressure. Combustion efficiency is shown to be very reasonable over the whole load range, similar to that of conventional diesel combustion. Combined with an improved thermal efficiency a moderate butanol-diesel blend is shown to have an average gross indicated efficiency of 50 % over the whole load range...|$|R
40|$|We {{present for}} the first time a nanostructured gold-based microsensor that can {{successfully}} detect elemental mercury (Hg 0) vapor through a nonspectroscopic means, directly from a real industry effluent gas sample obtained from an alumina refinery. The developed sensor did not require any preconditioning of the sampled industrial gas in order to remove humidity content as is the case for laborious solid sorbent methods (i. e., Appendix K and Method 30 B) certified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA). The sensor was developed by electrodepositing gold (Au) nanostructures (nanospikes) directly on the electrodes of the humble quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) transducer. Significantly, despite attempting to introduce a memory effect into the sensor in order to replicate real world scenarios during testing, the developed sensor still reported the Hg 0 vapor concentrations in the industrial gas to within ± 8 % of the certified solid sorbent analysis conducted at the time of obtaining the sample from the <b>refinery</b> <b>stream.</b> The developed microsensor technology introduced here can potentially be the first certified solid-state Hg 0 vapor monitoring system that can be utilized as part of Hg 0 control and removal processes in industry due to its exceptionally low susceptibility to cross-sensitivity, high accuracy, and ability to operate with untreated "real-world" sample gas...|$|E

This R&D program seeks to develop, demonstrate, and commercialize a biological process for converting these waste gases into ethanol for blending with gasoline. A 200, 000 BPD refinery could produce up to 38 million gallons ethanol per year. The program is being conducted in 3 phases: II, technology development; III, engineering development; and IV, demonstration. Phase I, exploratory development, has been completed. The research effort has yielded two strains (Isolates O- 52 and C- 01) which are {{to be used in}} the pilot studies to produce ethanol from CO, CO 2, and H 2 in petroleum waste gas. Results from single continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) laboratory tests have shown that 20 - 25 g/L ethanol can be produced with < 5 g/L acetic acid byproduct. Laboratory studies with two CSTRs in series have yielded ethanol concentrations of 30 - 35 g/L with 2 - 4 g/L acetic acid byproduct. Water recycle from distillation back to the fermenter shows that filtration of the water before distillation eliminates the recycle of toxic materials back to the fermenter. Product recovery in the process will use direct distillation to the azeotrope, followed by adsorption to produce neat ethanol. This is less energy intensive than e. g. solvent extraction, azeotropic distillation, or pervaporation.

40|$|HCCI {{combustion}} {{is highly}} dependent on in-cylinder thermal conditions and the chemical kinetics of the fuel. In addition to the impact on auto-ignition, the fuel properties will also affect the accumulation of deposits on the combustion chamber walls, and this in turn alters the in-cylinder thermal environment. Because the fuels available at the pump differ considerably in composition, strategies intended to bring the HCCI to market must account for the interplay between the fuel chemical components, the HCCI combustion event, and the deposit accumulation in the engine. 	In an effort to quantify the impacts of fuel composition on HCCI combustion, a large test matrix of fuel blends was investigated in a single-cylinder HCCI engine with re-induction of residual. These fuels were blended from pure refinery streams {{in an effort to}} reproduce expected variations of pump gasoline, and were oxygenated with 10 % ethanol. The matrix has three dimensions, i. e. the fraction of Olefins (O), the fraction of Aromatics (A), and the Sensitivity (S), defined as the difference between the RON and MON (RON-MON). The impact of fuel composition on performance and thermal efficiency was investigated in a systematic way, such that the obvious impact of the lower heating value is compensated for. The effect of fuel composition and additive packages on HCCI combustion chamber deposit formation was investigated with a second set of <b>refinery</b> <b>stream</b> fuels. The equilibrium CCD thickness was shown to be on the order of 250 micrometers for a highly Aromatic fuel, which is three to five times more than {{in the case of a}} low-Aromatic fuel. The subsequent part of the deposit formation study considered two additive packages, namely polybutene amine (PBA) and polyether amine (PEA). The PEA package helped to reduce in-cylinder thickness while the PBA package promoted growth. Finally, microscopic, spectroscopic and diffractometric techniques were employed to quantify physical structure, morphology, chemical composition, and porosity of deposits formed with different fuels and/or additive packages. It is shown that the morphological and chemical dissimilarities among CCD formed with different fuels and additives are not as important to the HCCI combustion event as is the overall thickness...|$|E
40|$|Partially Premixed Combustion {{has shown}} the {{potential}} of low emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and soot with a simultaneous improvement in fuel efficiency. Several research groups have shown that a load range from idle to full load is possible, when using low-octane-number <b>refinery</b> <b>streams,</b> in the gasoline boiling range. As such <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> {{are not expected to}} be commercially available on the short term, the use of naphtha blends that are commercially available could provide a practical solution.

Besides a presentation of the sensitivity to injection strategies, dilution levels and fuel pressure, emission performance is compared to legislated emission levels. Conventional diesel combustion benchmarks are used for reference to show possible improvements in indicated efficiency. Analysis of the heat release patterns revealed an interesting and strong correlation between the premixed fraction and the amount of soot produced. To be specific, each of the fuels showed a decrease in this fraction as either fuel pressure was lowered or load was increased, showing a transition from more premixed to mainly mixing-controlled combustion, with the corresponding soot emissions. For one blend, over the whole load range EURO VI PM levels were approached or achieved, combined with a peak gross indicated efficiency of 50 % clearly indicating the potential of this concept...|$|R

40|$|Fossil {{resources}} are currently the major energy sources {{but are the}} main culprits for the emission of CO 2, NOx, SOx and particulate matters that cause air pollution and global warming. This has led to exploration of alternative energy sources, which are CO 2 neutral and renewable to meet the future energy demand in a sustainable manner. Lignocellulosic biomass {{is one of the}} promising renewable energy sources which can be converted into a liquid product (bio-crude) by using “direct thermal liquefaction process” which is a variation of pyrolysis. This thesis aims to explore, design and evaluate direct thermal liquefaction processes for converting lignocellulosic biomass to bio-crude that can be further processed in an existing refinery unit to produce biofuels. This thesis shows that a working direct liquefaction process can be realized. Production of high molecular weight components (heavies: MW > 1000 Da) during the liquefaction was one of the major issues encountered in development of earlier processes, as it did not allow recycling of the bio-crude as a liquefaction medium. The other major issue was the very high pressure in the process (20 MPa), which required expensive materials and process equipment hampering the economics of the process. With regard to these two major issues, a significant {{progress has been made in}} this thesis. The latter issue is resolved by not using any reactive gases in the process. The absence of the reacting gases allowed a reactor pressure of 5 - 9 MPa, significantly lower than the pressure applied in the earlier PERC/LBL/HTU processes of 20 MPa. The former issue about the production of the heavies is addressed through various ways: minimizing the formation of the heavies (chapter 3 - 4), stabilizing/cracking them prior to recycling (chapter 5), removing them prior to recycling (chapter 6 - 7) and, in the last resort, not recycling the bio-crude at all but using a <b>refinery</b> <b>stream</b> as a liquefaction solvent instead (chapter 8 - 9). Proof of concepts of three processes of biomass liquefaction are provided in this thesis. The direct liquefaction process are found to be realized to produce the bio-crude at a crude oil equivalent price of 60 /bbl, which is competitive with current crude oil price also at 60 /bbl (2 nd quarter of 2015). The calculated price of the bio-cruse obtained through the liquefaction processes is competitive if not better than other technologies in this field such as pysolysis, gasification and fermentation, and shows potential of cost-effective production of bio-fuels...|$|E
40|$|There {{are some}} {{abundant}} long chain n -alkanes in <b>refinery</b> <b>stream</b> fuels {{which have a}} lower octane number and a higher pour point. It would be thus desirable to convert these normal paraffins to their branched isomers (which have higher octane number). Novel classes of cation incorporated Pt-M-HY (M being cations such as Zn 2 +, Al 3 +, Cd 2 +, Ni 2 +, Cr 3 + and some others) and bifunctional Pt-HY zeolite catalysts have been prepared and tested for hydroisomerization of n -Paraffins (n -heptane as a model). The modified zeolite catalysts showed superiority {{to that of the}} parent bifunctional Pt-HY zeolite catalyst in term of isomerization of n -heptane. This is due to the desorption-transfer promoting behavior of the mentioned cations which cause fast removal of intermediate alkylcarbocation from Brønsted acid sites (decreasing the residence time of these species on acid sites). By decreasing the residence time of the intermediate alkylcarbocations on Brønsted acid sites, these species did not undergo further cracking reactions. As a result the isomerization products increased significantly and cracked products decreased. Such behavior was ascribed to the formation of new desorption-transfer promoting sites. A triangular "acid/dehydro-hydrogenation/desorption-transfer promoting" site configuration (trifunctional catalyst) was proposed. The data obtained from characterization studies such as BET, XRD, FTIR and NH 3 -TPD show that cationic species do not effect: pore size distribution, surface area, crystallinity, dehydrogenation-hydrogenation (Pt) site, and Brønsted acid site density and strength. No significant ion-exchange was observed upon Zn 2 +, Al 3 +, Cd 2 +, Ni 2 + and Cr 3 + loading at the reaction conditions. These species only create some Lewis acid sites of which the acid character appeared {{to play an important role}} in the enhancement of the isomerization activity. Our concept of trifunctional catalyst suggests that Zn 2 + and other ions behave as sorption competitors to the zeolite Brønsted acid sites. As a result, the isomerization activity of zeolite increased where the effect of Zn 2 + was higher than the other cations. In addition the simultaneous incorporation Zn 2 + or the other cations with Pt species gave better results than that of the sequential loading. With increasing reaction temperature more acid sites were activated and became involved in the reaction, thus, each reaction temperature needed a specific Zn 2 + loading in order to provide the best isomerization activity, and a higher amount of zinc was required at higher reaction temperature where the cracking activity is stronger. The kinetic studies showed that the behavior of the trifunctional Pt-Zn y -HY was significantly different than that of the bifunctional Pt-HY zeolite catalyst. All kinetic data showed a drastic reduction of cracking (Ý-scission) within the temperature range of 195 C̕- 240 C̕...|$|E

In this context, {{one of the most}} studied biocatalytic processes is the biodesulfurization (BDS) of thiophenic sulfur-containing compounds such as benzothiophene (BT) and dibenzothiophene (DBT) in crude oils and <b>refinery</b> <b>streams.</b> Three newly isolated bacterial strains, which were affiliated as Rhodococcus sp. strain SA 11, Stenotrophomonas sp. strain SA 21, and Rhodococcus sp. strain SA 31, were enriched from oil contaminated soil in the presence of DBT as the sole S source. GC-FID analysis of DBT-grown cultures showed consumption of DBT, transient formation of DBT sulfone (DBTO 2) and accumulation of 2 -hydroxybiphenyl (2 -HBP). Molecular detection of the plasmid-borne dsz operon, which codes for the DBT desulfurization activity, revealed the presence of dszA, dszB, and dszC genes. These results point to the operation of the known 4 S pathway in the BDS of DBT. The maximum consumption rate of DBT was 11 µmol/g Dry Cell Weight (DCW) /h and the maximum formation rate of 2 -HBP formation was 4 µmol/g DCW/h. Inhibition of both cell growth and DBT consumption by 2 -HBP was observed for all isolates but SA 11 isolate was the least affected. The isolated biocatalysts desulfurized other model DBT alkylated homologs. SA 11 isolate was capable of desulfurizing BT as well. Resting cells of SA 11 exhibited 10 % reduction in total sulfur present in heavy crude oil and 18 % reduction in total sulfur present in the hexane-soluble fraction of the heavy crude oil.

Indeed, biocrude is soluble in all solvents, and char is not formed by degradation of biocrude but rather by degradation of early carbohydrate intermediates.

In vivo micronucleus tests on heavy paraffinic DAE, RAEs, and a range of other petroleum substances have been negative. The exception to this general trend was a marginally positive response with light paraffinic DAE. Most DAEs are considered unlikely to produce chromosomal effects in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Distillate {{test fuel}} blends were {{generated}} for prescribed variations in composition and physical properties. Fuels covering {{a wide range}} in properties and composition which would provide a matrix of fuels for possible use in future combustion research programs were identified. Except for tetralin the blending components were all from typical <b>refinery</b> <b>streams.</b> Property variation blends span a boiling range within 150 C to 335 C, freezing point - 23 C to - 43 C, aromatic content 20 to 50 volume percent, hydrogen content 11. 8 to 14. 2 mass percent, viscosity 4 and 11 cSt (- 20 C), and naphthalenes 8 and 16 volume percent. Composition variation blends were made with two base stocks, one paraffinic and the other napthenic. To each base stock was added each of three aromatic type fuels (alkyl benzenes, tetralin, and naphthalenes) for assigned initial boiling point, final boiling point, and hydrogen content. The hydrogen content was 13. 5 mass percent for the paraffinic base stock blends and 12. 5 mass percent and 11. 5 mass percent for the naphthenic base stock blends. Sample 5 -gallon quantities of all blends were prepared and analyzed...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{significant}} improvements have been reached {{both in the}} technology of hydrocarbons pyrolysis for olefines production and in the modeling of the kinetic schemes involved. Some {{of the reasons for}} these improvements are: - New sophisticated instrumentation for continuous analysis of effluents from commercial units. - Economic interest for non-conventional feedstocks, e. g. vacuum gasoils, hydrotreated heavy gasoils, recycle fractions, reformed naphthas and/or other <b>refinery</b> <b>streams.</b> - Improvements in computer technology, hardware and software, which allow handling, in real time, complex systems of kinetic equations. - New strategies for on-line plant control and optimization. The rising needs of accuracy in predicting the reactor effluents under a wider range of feedstocks and different reactor coils demand models even more flexible and more detailed than the best ones actually available. In this paper the criteria for the developement of complex and non-regular kinetic schemes (up to thousands of reactions involved) are presented and discussed. The automatic generation of the elementary reaction stoichiometries and the non-Arrhenius behaviour of the kinetic constants are also considered. Some effort has also been devoted to the optimization and data reconciliation of the reactors effluents {{within the framework of the}} entire olefins plant...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, the {{extraction}} efficiency {{as well as}} the regeneration of the IL, 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium octylsulfate ([BMIM][OcSO 4]) for the desulfurization of the FCC diesel fuels was studied. It was found that [BMIM][OcSO 4] IL is much more efficient in removing sulfur from the less sulfur-containing LCO (549.9  ppm) than VGO which contains 4203  ppm sulfur. This {{may be due to the}} complex chemical composition of the VGO including more unreactive different types of organic sulfur compounds and therefore the treatment of VGO to acceptable sulfur levels may require much more extraction stages, high volumes of IL, and more energy which all translates to high processing costs. The optimum extractive equilibrium time of about 30  min in this work is in line with results from others researchers, i.e., it was found that {{the extraction}} equilibrium for low viscosity ILs, such as [BMI][N(CN) 2] and [EMI][N(CN) 2] is 10  min while for high viscosity ILs, such as ([BMIM][BF 4], [BPy][BF 4],[OPy][NO 3], and [BMIM/Cl][FeCl 3], [HNMP][HSO 4]) it is slightly higher at about 30  min. Sulfur extraction efficiency of different ILs at different IL-oil mass ratios for real fuel oils was also investigated and the results in this work confirm previous results that showed that the desulfurization of real fuel oils is highest at 2 : 1 and lowest at 1 : 5 mass ratios for both high and low viscosity ILs. However, the rate of the increase in the S extraction efficiency is not same for different IL-oil mass ratios [28, 29]. The fuels sulfur content and stream composition affects the extraction efficiency and effectiveness of IL, as such it may be advisable to have the desulfurization unit after the FCC rather than before in a refinery network. The results also imply that the reduction of sulfur to considerably negligible amount may be more possible through the increase of the number of extraction stages than increasing the oil/IL mass ratio as for industrial application low IL/oil mass ratios are recommended due to the high IL costs. The reusability of [BMIM][OcSO 4] has been also assessed and hexane was used for the regeneration of [BMIM][OcSO 4]. [BMIM][OcSO 4] IL can be regenerated 4 times before noticeable drop in efficiency. The results show that [BMIM][OcSO 4] IL may be used for the extractive desulfurization of <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> such as FCC diesel oils especially for deep desulfurization and olefin-rich <b>refinery</b> <b>streams,</b> as the use of ILs does not alter the oil matrix and does not require hydrogen, which could be a bottleneck in some refineries.|$|R

40|$|Purification and {{recovery}} of hydrogen from hydrocarbons in <b>refinery</b> <b>streams</b> in the petrochemical industry is an emerging research {{field in the}} study of membrane gas separation. Hollow fiber membrane modules can be easily implemented into separation processes at the industrial scale. In this report, hollow yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) fiber-supported zeolitic imidazole framework- 8 (ZIF- 8) membranes were successfully prepared using a mild and environmentally friendly seeded growth method. Our single-component permeation studies demonstrated that the membrane had a very high hydrogen permeance (~ 15 × 10 - 7 mol/m 2 sPa) and an ideal selectivity of H 2 /C 3 H 8 of more than 1000 at room temperature. This high membrane permeability and selectivity caused serious concentration polarization in the separation of H 2 /C 3 H 8 mixtures, which led to almost 50 % drop in both the H 2 permeance and the separation factor. Enhanced mixing on the feed side could reduce the effect of the concentration polarization. Our experimental data also indicated that the membranes had excellent reproducibility and long-term stability, indicating that the hollow fiber-supported ZIF- 8 membranes developed in this study have great potential in industry-scale separation of hydrogen. © 2012 Elsevier B.
