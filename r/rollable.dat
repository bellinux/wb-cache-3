50|$|While the {{commercial}} success of flat-panel display opens {{an era of}} large area electronics, other emerging applications, such as <b>rollable</b> display, printable thin film solar cell and electronic skin, demonstrate further desirable attributes for macroelectronic systems, including flexibility, portability and low-cost. To realize these attributes, a growing trend is to fabricate macroelectronic products directly on flexible substrates, such as polymers. The flat-panel displays currently available in market are fabricated on glass substrates and are fragile. A case in recent news is the cracking of the screens of the iPod nano, a music player that Apple Computer expects to be its best-selling portable device. By contrast, displays made on thin polymer substrates are rugged. Flexible displays of large areas will be lightweight and can be rolled up - they will be portable. For example, in Sept. 2005, Philips Polymer Vision has revealed the world's first prototype of a <b>rollable</b> electronic reader, which can unfold to a 5-inch display and roll back into a pocket-size (100×60×20 mm) device. Furthermore, such thin-film devices on flexible polymer substrates can lend themselves to low-cost fabrication process (i.e., roll-to-roll printing), resulting in lightweight, rugged and flexible macroelectronic products.|$|E

50|$|The Roll Out Solar Array, {{known as}} ROSA, is a solar array {{designed}} by NASA. This {{new type of}} solar array provides much more energy than the old solar arrays. Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with heavy panels folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than rigid panel arrays. It is a flexible and <b>rollable</b> solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a compact cylinder for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings {{as well as an}} increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of photovoltaic cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom. The booms look like split tubes made of a stiff composite material, flattened and rolled up lengthwise.The array does not need any motor to unfurl.This is achieved using the energy stored in the booms that is released as each boom transitions from a coil shape to a straight support arm. Those solar wings are then deployed due to strain energy in rolled booms that are present at the two ends of the structure.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the display}} {{industry}} {{is focusing on}} making bendable or flexible displays with higher quality and larger area. Ultimately, {{there is a very}} high possibility that future displays will be <b>rollable.</b> The biggest problem with <b>rollable</b> displays is the fabrication of a polarizer film to prevent reflection of the OLED. To develop a <b>rollable</b> display, the display should be made of material with a very thin thickness, like that of paper. However, the thickness of the polarizer film used for displays is only approximately 180 ㎛. This means that the film is too thick to be applied to <b>rollable</b> displays. If a polarizer of wire grid type, which we investigate in this study, is used, it can reduce the thickness of this film to a value under approximately 1 ㎛. One research result has been to discover that Fe 3 O 4 is a very slightly absorptive material. Especially, most research into Fe 3 O 4 thin films has concentrated on its characteristics in nanotubes. So, our purpose in this research is to investigate the deposition process of Fe 3 O 4 thin-film under various conditions using an E-beam evaporator; we intend to compare these various processes with each other after measuring the refractive index...|$|E

40|$|Scaled {{centrifuge}} modelling {{techniques were}} used to study the soil-structure interactions and performance of a jointed <b>rollable</b> aluminium roadway (or trackway) system on soft clay under light truck tyre loads. The measured performance and subsequent analyses highlighted that the articulated connections significantly reduced the overall longitudinal flexural stiffness of the roadway leading to stress concentrations in the soil below the joints under tyred vehicle loadings. This resulted in rapid localised failure of the supporting soil that in turn led to excessive transverse flexure of the roadway and ultimately plastic deformations. It is shown that the performance of <b>rollable</b> roadway systems under tyred vehicle trafficking will be improved by eliminating joint rotation to increase longitudinal stiffnes...|$|E
40|$|Deployable {{structures}} {{are a common}} spacecraft configuration feature. Deployables are used to configure spacecraft inertia properties, provide expanded antenna aperture and solar array area, or to provide separation between spacecraft components. Lightsat design would be especially enhanced by small size lightweight deployable structures. A review {{of the state of}} the art of deployable structures has been conducted and shows that these devices can be divided into two categories: one, <b>rollable</b> mast of the stem, bistem, or stacer types; and two, folding trusses. The <b>rollable</b> masts are generally of open section and susceptible to thermal excitation. Folding trusses are not available in small size. To address these design challenges, a <b>rollable</b> closed section biconvex mast was design, constructed, and experimentally evaluated. The mast was constructed of composites to obtain high stiffness and low weight and to exploit the relative ease with which a shaped cross section can be fabricated. The mast has a lenticular cross section that can be flattened to allow it to be stowed around a drum. Once on orbit, the mast is unrolled and opens up to the lenticular cross section. A novel stiffener has also been developed which increases the capability of the section. Design characteristics and test results are presented...|$|E
