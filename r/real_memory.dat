500|$|Shelley {{wrote to}} his wife Mary that Allegra looked pale and quiet {{when he saw her}} in 1818. When he saw her again in 1821 at the Capuchin convent in Bagnacavallo, when she was four, he again felt she looked pale and {{delicate}} and was infuriated by the Roman Catholic education she was receiving, though he had initially told Byron he approved of her being sent to a convent. [...] "(Besides) Paradise & angels ... she has a prodigious list of saints—and is always talking of the Bambino ... The idea of bringing up so sweet a creature in the midst of such trash till Sixteen!" [...] he wrote." [...] However, though Shelley thought the little girl was more serious and contemplative than he remembered, he said she had not lost her [...] "excessive vivacity." [...] After five months in the convent school, her behaviour had also improved; she obeyed the nuns readily and was well-disciplined, though Shelley didn't think the nuns had been too severe with her. The child asked Shelley to [...] "tell her mother she wanted a kiss and a gold dress and would he please beg her Papa and Mammina to visit her." [...] Allegra no longer had any <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> of Clairmont, but had grown attached to [...] "her Mammina," [...] Byron's mistress Teresa, Countess Guiccioli, who had mothered her. Teresa gave the little girl her own childhood toys and played with her when she spent weeks recovering from a childhood illness.|$|E
2500|$|EMS was a {{specification}} {{available on}} all PCs, including the Intel 8086 and Intel 8088 which allowed add-on hardware to page small chunks of memory {{in and out}} of the [...] "real mode" [...] addressing space. (0x0400–0xFFFF). This required that a hole in <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> be available, typically (0xE000–0xEFFF). A program would then have to explicitly request the page to be accessed before using it. These memory locations could then be used arbitrarily until replaced by another page. This is very similar to modern virtual memory. However, in a virtual memory system, the operating system handles all paging operations: the programmer, for the most part, does not have to consider this.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hardware}} severely {{restricts the}} ways in which control can be passed from one ring to another, and also enforces restrictions on the types of memory access that can be performed across rings. Using x86 as an example, there is a special gate structure which is referenced by the call instruction that transfers control in a secure way towards predefined entry points in lower-level (more trusted) rings; this functions as a supervisor call in many operating systems that use the ring architecture. The hardware restrictions are designed to limit opportunities for accidental or malicious breaches of security. [...] In addition, the most privileged ring may be given special capabilities, (such as <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> addressing that bypasses the virtual memory hardware).|$|E
50|$|Scientists {{from the}} University of Missouri {{have used the}} DRM {{paradigm}} to look at brain activity for <b>real</b> and false <b>memories.</b> They found evidence that suggests different brain processes may underlie the retrieval of <b>real</b> and false <b>memories,</b> with false-memory retrieval showing distinctly different patterns of neural activity to retrieval of <b>real</b> <b>memories.</b>|$|R

2500|$|On most systems {{channels}} operate using real (or physical) addresses, {{while the}} channel programs are built using virtual addresses. [...] The operating system {{is responsible for}} translating these channel programs before executing them, and for this particular purpose the Input/Output Supervisor (IOS) has a special [...] "fast fix" [...] function which was designed into the OS Supervisor just for those [...] "fixes" [...] which are of relatively short duration (i.e., significantly shorter than [...] "wall-clock time"). Pages containing data {{to be used by}} the I/O operation are locked into <b>real</b> <b>memory,</b> or page fixed. [...] The channel program is copied and all virtual addresses are replaced by real addresses before the I/O operation is started. After the operation completes, the pages are unfixed.|$|E
60|$|The other fact to {{be remembered}} is that {{scientific}} research {{for the last few}} years has worked steadily in the direction of confirming and not dissipating the legends of the populace. To take only the obvious instance, modern excavators with modern spades have found a solid stone labyrinth in Crete, like that associated with the Minataur, which was conceived as being as cloudy a fable as the Chimera. To most people this would have seemed quite as frantic as finding the roots of Jack's Beanstalk or the skeletons in Bluebeard's cupboard, yet it is simply the fact. Finally, a truth is {{to be remembered}} which scarcely ever is remembered in estimating the past. It is the paradox that the past is always present: yet it is not what was, but whatever seems to have been; for all the past is a part of faith. What did they believe of their fathers? In this matter new discoveries are useless because they are new. We may find men wrong in what they thought they were, but we cannot find them wrong in what they thought they thought. It is therefore very practical to put in a few words, if possible, something of what a man of these islands in the Dark Ages would have said about his ancestors and his inheritance. I will attempt here to put some of the simpler things in their order of importance as he would have seen them; and if we are to understand our fathers who first made this country anything like itself, it is most important that we should remember that if this was not their real past, it was their <b>real</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between executive processes, associative learning and {{different aspects of}} <b>real</b> world <b>memory</b> functioning were explored {{in a sample of}} cannabis users and nonusers. Measures of executive component processes, associative learning, everyday memory, prospective memory, and cognitive failures were administered. Relative to nonusers, cannabis users were found to be impaired in several aspects of <b>real</b> world <b>memory</b> functioning. No other group differences were apparent. The absence of cannabis related deficits in those executive component processes and aspects of learning that are believed to support <b>real</b> world <b>memory</b> processes is surprising given that cannabis related deficits were obtained in <b>real</b> world <b>memory.</b> The present results are discussed within the context of neuroimaging evidence which suggests that cannabis users may exhibit different patterns of neural activation when performing executive tasks while not always exhibiting deficits on these tasks...|$|R
50|$|Page {{tables are}} used to {{translate}} the virtual addresses seen by the application into physical addresses used by the hardware to process instructions; such hardware that handles this specific translation is often known as the memory management unit. Each entry in the page table holds a flag indicating whether the corresponding page is in <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> or not. If it is in <b>real</b> <b>memory,</b> the page table entry will contain the <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> address at which the page is stored. When a reference is made to a page by the hardware, if the page table entry for the page indicates {{that it is not}} currently in <b>real</b> <b>memory,</b> the hardware raises a page fault exception, invoking the paging supervisor component of the operating system.|$|E

50|$|In computing, thin {{provisioning}} involves using virtualization {{technology to}} {{give the appearance of}} having more physical resources than are actually available. If a system always has enough resource to simultaneously support all of the virtualized resources, then it is not thin provisioned. The term thin provisioning is applied to disk layer in this article, but could refer to an allocation scheme for any resource. For example, <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> in a computer is typically thin-provisioned to running tasks with some form of address translation technology doing the virtualization. Each task acts as if it has <b>real</b> <b>memory</b> allocated. The sum of the allocated virtual memory assigned to tasks typically exceeds the total of <b>real</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
