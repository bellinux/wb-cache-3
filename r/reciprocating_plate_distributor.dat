40|$|Pullulan is {{a natural}} {{biopolymer}} with many useful traits. It has been produced commercially through fermentation with Aureobasidium pullulans at a fairly stable level for decades. Yet, the use of pullulan has been largely limited to the food industry due to its relatively high price. This research project {{was carried out in}} order to improve the cost efficiency in the mass production of high molecular weight pullulan and hopefully render it more economically available for many of its potential applications. One of the main challenges in its production is the mixing of viscous non-Newtonian broth that is formed gradually through fermentation. A new radial <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> impeller was designed based on the axial <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> impeller, which was shown to be efficient when dealing with highly viscous non-Newtonian media. The new design was focused on making the mechanism of the axial reciprocation more adaptable to existing industrial mixing devices. A prototype of this new impeller was built and tested to determine its power requirement and mass transfer characteristics in a laboratory scale bioreactor. Compared to a triple Rushton impeller and an axial <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> impeller, the new impeller proved to be efficient in different media {{with a wide range of}} rheological properties. Simulation using computational fluid dynamics also confirmed that mixing using this new impeller was more uniform compared to the triple Rushton impeller. Experimental designs were employed to optimize the mass production of high molecular weight pullulan using this new impeller. An exopolysaccharide productivity of 0. 30 gL- 1 h- 1 was obtained while maintaining the molecular weight of pullulan, which is indicated by the broth viscosity, at a high level. The findings of this study provide a new way to adequately mix viscous broth of aerobic fermentations. Also, this new radial <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> impeller should be easily adapted to large scale industrial bioreactors to achieve more uniform mixing in rheologically-evolving fermentation broths...|$|R

Distilled water and aqueous solutions of carboxymethyl-cellulose of different concentration were used as the liquid phase and air as the gas phase in this investigation. The gas holdup was measured after the gas flow and the reciprocating action had been stopped. An empirical correlation which correlates the gas holdup with the specific power consumption and the superficial gas velocity showed that the aeration intensity had a greater influence on the gas holdup than the intensity of agitation. Because the gas holdup was approximately the same in RPC's of different diameters, an equation relating the gas holdup with the specific power consumption and the superficial gas velocity was derived.

Comparison is established for the transition velocity from bubbling to turbulent regime, Uc, deduced from the pressure fluctuations in the bed using gauge pressure measurements. The effect of the distributor on the flow structure near the bottom region of the bed is studied using differential and gauge pressure transducers located at different axial positions along the bed. The radial voidage profile in the bed is also measured using optical fiber probes, which provide local measurements of the voidage at different heights above the <b>distributor.</b> The <b>distributor</b> <b>plate</b> has a significant effect on the bed hydrodynamics.

Both systems recover energy from high-temperature flue gases and produce steam. In a one-year evaluation test on an aluminum remelt furnace, the FBWHRS generated about 26 million lb of saturated steam at 150 psig.

40|$|Abstract Background Whole-body {{vibration}} (WBV) is a {{new type}} of exercise that has been increasingly tested for the ability to prevent bone fractures and osteoporosis in frail people. There are two currently marketed vibrating plates: a) the whole plate oscillates up and down; b) reciprocating vertical displacements on the left and right side of a fulcrum, increasing the lateral accelerations. A few studies have shown recently the effectiveness of the up-and-down plate for increasing Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and balance; but the effectiveness of the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> technique remains mainly unknown. The aim was to compare the effects of WBV using a reciprocating platform at frequencies lower than 20 Hz and a walking-based exercise programme on BMD and balance in post-menopausal women. Methods Twenty-eight physically untrained post-menopausal women were assigned at random to a WBV group or a Walking group. Both experimental programmes consisted of 3 sessions per week for 8 months. Each vibratory session included 6 bouts of 1 min (12. 6 Hz in frequency and 3 cm in amplitude with 60 ° of knee flexion) with 1 min rest between bouts. Each walking session was 55 minutes of walking and 5 minutes of stretching. Hip and lumbar BMD (g·cm - 2) were measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and balance was assessed by the blind flamingo test. ANOVA for repeated measurements was adjusted by baseline data, weight and age. Results After 8 months, BMD at the femoral neck in the WBV group was increased by 4. 3 % (P = 0. 011) compared to the Walking group. In contrast, the BMD at the lumbar spine was unaltered in both groups. Balance was improved in the WBV group (29 %) but not in the Walking group. Conclusion The 8 -month course of vibratory exercise using a <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> is feasible and is more effective than walking to improve two major determinants of bone fractures: hip BMD and balance. </p...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- The {{phenomenon}} of valveless pumping is studied {{in a ring}} consisting of two tubes, a flexible and a hard one filled with water. A non zero mean flow-rate is established via a <b>reciprocating</b> flat <b>plate</b> compressing and decompressing {{a portion of the}} flexible tube with a controllable frequency and depth of compression. Four parameters of the problem were examined, namely the frequency of the oscillating plate, its length, the depth of compression and the location where the tube is compressed. Four signals were simultaneously recorded, namely the flow-rate at the mid length of the hard tube, the static pressure at the tube’s ends and the displacement of the oscillating plate. Also, the tube cross-sectional area was measured versus the displacement of the oscillating plate for various values of the maximum depth of compression. Analysis of the obtained data showed that a unidirectional flow is established increasing the frequency of compression and it maximizes when the compression frequency coincides with the natural frequency of the hydraulic loop. The mean value of the flow-rate increases when the point of compression moves far from the mid length of the flexible tube, when the length of the <b>reciprocating</b> <b>plate</b> increases and when the depth of compression increases. With regard to the direction of the flow this is from the area of the tube compression {{towards the end of the}} hard tube which is located closer to the compression area...|$|R

Aqueous carboxymethylcellulose (sodium salt, CMC) solutions were used as the liquid phase, the solid phase was spheres placed into interplate spaces, and the gas plase was air.

The gas holdup increased with increasing vibration intensity and superficial gas velocity in both the two- and three-phase system. With increasing concentration of the CMC PP 50 solution (Newtonian fluid), the gas holdup decreased, because the coalescence of the bubbles was favored by the higher liquid viscosity. In {{the case of the}} CMC PP 200 solutions (non-Newtonian liquids), the gas holdup depends on the combined influence of the rheological properties of the liquid phase, the vibration intensity and the superficial gas velocity. The gas holdup in the three-phase systems was greater than that in the two-phase ones under the same operating conditions. Increasing the solids content has little influence on the gas holdup. The gas holdup was correlated with the power consumption (either the time-averaged or total power consuption) and the superficial gas velocity...|$|R
