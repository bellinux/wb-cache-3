50|$|Early British dumpers had a payload {{of about}} a ton and were 2-wheel drive, driving on the front axle and steered at the back wheels. The single {{cylinder}} diesel engine (sometimes made by Lister) was started <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> cranking. The steering wheel turned the back wheels, not front. Having neither electrics nor hydraulics {{there was not much}} to go wrong. The skip was secured by a catch by the driver's feet. When the catch is released, the skip tips under the weight of its contents at pivot points below, and after being emptied is <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|R

The lift span can be <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> using a chain harness {{and a system}} of cables and pulleys located on the timber lift towers and balanced by concrete counter weights. It carries metal tramway lines of 2-foot (610mm) gauge laid over timber sleepers.

50|$|Adult Campbell ducks weigh {{approximately}} 3-5 pounds. Campbells {{can come}} in three color varieties: khaki, dark and white. They are a cross between Mallard, Rouen and Runner ducks. The Khaki Campbell drake is mostly khaki colored with a darker head usually olive green lacking the white ring of its Mallard ancestors. The Khaki Campbell duck has a more modest plumage of Khaki covering {{the entirety of the}} body. Despite popular misconceptions of skittish or flightly behavior Campbells are a very gentle, passive and friendly breed when <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> until maturity. They are a good breed for young families and children to raise.|$|R
50|$|Khaki Campbells become mature at {{approximately}} 7 months. Khaki Campbell ducks seldom hatch out others' young; however, in very communal situations do hatch large broods together. Most brooding behavior has been sacrificed {{in exchange for}} prolific egg laying ability in this breed. The ducks, when <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand,</b> are not usually defensive of their eggs or nests, making collection of eggs very easy. Mechanical incubators or broody chickens are used to hatch out Khaki Campbell ducklings when ducks are not present in the process. Incubation takes approximately 23 to 28 days for a Khaki Campbell duckling to hatch and eggs need to be inspected for ducklings that have not emerged from their egg completely.|$|R

50|$|Sparrows {{have been}} kept as pets at many times in history, {{even though they are}} not {{colourful}} and their songs are unremarkable. They are also difficult to keep, as pet sparrows must be <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand</b> as nestlings, when considerable supplies of insects are required to feed them. Nevertheless, many are successful in hand raising orphaned or abandoned baby sparrows. Various internet forums are providing useful information on how to hand raise an injured or orphaned baby sparrow. The earliest mentions of pet sparrows are from the Romans. Not all the passeri mentioned, often as pets, in Roman literature were necessarily sparrows, but some accounts of them clearly describe their appearance and habits. The pet passer of Lesbia in Catullus's poems may not have been a sparrow, but a thrush or European goldfinch. John Skelton's The Boke of Phyllyp Sparowe is a lament for a pet house sparrow belonging to a Jane Scrope, narrated by Scrope.|$|R

5000|$|The organ {{was built}} by Thomas Christopher Lewis in {{consultation}} with William Rea, the Newcastle City organist, and was dedicated a mere {{three months after the}} consecration of the church in February 1885. It stands in the South Transept, directly under the tower, facing North, with a generous amount of free space around it. From this position, its commanding voice can be heard {{in all parts of the}} building without loss of impact, even with a full congregation.It is a substantial instrument, built in Lewis's grand style with Swell behind Great on the same level and Pedal on three unit chests behind and alongside the manual divisions. There is no facade casework, although the front pipes appear to have been laid out to receive one, the lower part is panelled in oak. The console is central in the case and is 'en fenêtre'. The action to manuals and drawstops is mechanical; the pedal action is pneumatic. A Discus blower feeds the main bellows which can still be <b>raised</b> <b>by</b> <b>hand.</b> A full restoration of the organ was carried out in 1987, by Harrison & Harrison of Durham. The organ is one of a small number in the country designed by Lewis which have not been significantly altered. [...] The church has a regular recital series on Bank Holidays and in the summer months.|$|R
