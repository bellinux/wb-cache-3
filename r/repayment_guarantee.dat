50|$|The Icesave bill 1 was {{the first}} {{negotiated}} loan agreement, attempting to define the repayment terms for these two loans. It was enacted on 2 September 2009 but was not accepted by the governments of UK and Netherlands, due to a unilaterally attached term added by the Icelandic parliament which limited Iceland's <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantee</b> only to 2024, with automatic cancellation of any potential owing still existing beyond this year. Instead, UK and Netherlands then counter proposed {{a new version of}} the loan agreement, referred to as Icesave bill 2, where no time limit was included for the Icelandic state's <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantee.</b> This was at first accepted by the Icelandic parliament, but the Icelandic president refused to enact the law and referred approval to a referendum being held on 6 March 2010, where voters subsequently rejected the law.|$|E
40|$|We analyse {{different}} forms of debt mutualisation in a union of countries. One country suffers from a political distortion and may resort to (partial) debt default. We consider a debt <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantee,</b> which can be "unlimited" or "limited", i. e. only be invoked when the guarantee threshold is not exceeded. We also explore the "blue-red" bonds proposal, under which blue debt is guaranteed, while red debt is not guaranteed. Only a suitably chosen limited guarantee induces the government to reduce debt and raises union welfare. This result is upheld under the time-consistent solution when there are costs {{to the rest of}} the union of not providing financial rescue. Making the guarantee also conditional on sufficient structural reform may in addition stimulate reform effort, thereby raising union welfare...|$|E

The £ 1 billion funding for the Northern Line extension to the London underground was also considered to be an innovative method of funding; with the entire project being funded with the intention of no detriment to the British taxpayer. This involved the Greater London Authority borrowing the £ 1 billion, with a <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantee</b> provided by the UK Government to minimise borrowing costs [28]. The loan repayments are then to be made through contributions from local developers (to be collected by the local authorities) and through the growth in business rates revenue within the enterprise zone in which the extension is to be built. Over time these funding sources are expected to cover the complete repayment of the loan [28]. However, the transferability of the model to dissimilar cities is less clear, as it is only the soaring demand for property and high land values that are considered to have made the scheme feasible in London [29].|$|E

40|$|This essay {{shows that}} {{government}} credit-allocation schemes generate incentive conflicts that undermine {{the quality of}} bank supervision and eventually produce banking crisis. For political reasons, most countries establish a regulatory culture that embraces three economically contradictory elements: politically directed subsidies to selected bank borrowers; subsidized provision of explicit or implicit <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantees</b> for the creditors of banks that participate in the credit-allocation scheme; and defective government monitoring {{and control of the}} subsidies to leveraged risk-taking that the other two elements produce. In 2007 - 2008, technological change and regulatory competition simultaneously encouraged incentive-conflicted supervisors to outsource much of their due discipline to credit-rating firms and encouraged banks to securitize their loans in ways that pushed credit risks on poorly underwritten loans into corners of the universe where supervisors and credit-ratings firms would not see them. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{economic}} principles underlying {{the relationship between}} the real sector (non-financial) and the banking sector structures. Most literature has so far focused on the structure of conglomerates (Keiretsu/Chaebol) in East Asia in explaining the fast economic growth and/or recent crisis in the region. Traditionally, the strong vertical relationship between core companies and their subsidiaries in the real sector was believed to be a driving force for the economic success in the region. However, the degree of vertical relationship varies depending upon macroeconomic fluctuations and subsequently affects their relationship banks. The paper analyses the information sharing in a bilateral oligopoly framework. When banks prefer strong collaterals and/or credible third party <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantees,</b> a weaker vertical relationship in the real sector should lead to a consolidation in the banking sector via mergers or exits. Empirical evidence from the panel data constructed for the top 10 Chaebols and their subsidiaries between 1994 - 2002 supports the argument. ...|$|R

GAO found that FSA had more than $ 16. 6 billion in outstanding farm loans as of September 2000. Farm loan losses incurred by FSA during fiscal year 2000 totalled about $ 486 million.

40|$|Since South Africa {{held its}} first {{democratic}} elections in 1994, it has given significant attention to building an effective system of decentralization including provincial and local government. While provincial governments are responsible mainly {{for the implementation of}} social services such as health and education, the provision of much of the urban infrastructure is the responsibility of local government. Although many challenges remain, the country has made significant progress over the past decade in addressing urban service backlogs in poor areas. At the same time, it has greatly improved macroeconomic fundamentals. The system of financing local government seeks to place accountability firmly at the local level, with most revenues in the larger urban centers raised locally through a combination of local taxes and fees for services, while poorer regions are predominantly grant funded. The objective has been to encourage the financing of capital infrastructure through local borrowing based on sustainable, transparent local finances rather than national <b>repayment</b> <b>guarantees,</b> which are outlawed. There is some indirect subsidization of loans through the state-owned Development Bank of Southern Africa. But the emphasis is on achieving redistribution through transparent, formula-based grants paid directly from national to local governments. While further bedding down of the system is needed, the approach is proving largely successful. The paper concludes by recommending that the existing division between provinces as providers of social services and local governments as the key locus of responsibility for services related to the built environment should be strengthened, particularly through the devolution of more urban transport related functions. A number of key risks are also highlighted, including issues related to the reform of local business taxes.

40|$|Critics of fringe banking—{{products}} like payday loans, pawn loans, and rent-toown leases—frequently {{argue that}} these products cause borrowers to experience financial distress. This argument has enormous intuitive appeal: Fringe credit is very costly, and usually the borrowers who use it are already in a serious financial bind. Taking on additional debt and paying high prices for it, the reasoning goes, drive them over the brink. Surprisingly, however, linking financial distress to fringe banking {{is extremely difficult to}} do. This Article represents the first attempt to uncover the relationship between fringe banking and financial distress by systematically analyzing the structure of fringe credit markets and the characteristics of specific fringe credit transactions. Contrary to the assumptions made by the bulk of the literature, I argue that the link between fringe banking and financial distress is dubious. Because fringe creditors cannot rely on borrowers’ credit scores to predict whether they will be repaid, creditors structure fringe credit products to virtually <b>guarantee</b> <b>repayment.</b> Because <b>repayment</b> is <b>guaranteed</b> by the structure of the transaction, it is nearly impossible for borrowers to take on unmanageable debt loads. Yet, a significant amount of regulatory intervention into fringe banking markets is premised upon the relationship between fringe banking and financial distress. Policy makers lump fringe credit together with other forms of credit that do cause financial distress, resulting in misguided and overly broad policies. The Article concludes by exploring the policy implications of determining that fringe banking products do not cause distress...|$|R
