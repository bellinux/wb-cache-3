5|$|First {{unveiled}} {{in a single}} uppercase weight in 1928, Gill Sans achieved national prominence almost immediately, when it was chosen the following year to become the standard typeface for the LNER railway system, soon appearing on every facet of the company's identity, from metal locomotive nameplates and hand-painted station signage to printed <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> menus, timetables and advertising posters.|$|E
5|$|The {{prototype}} and series trains have various differences. The {{number of}} seats was increased from 264 to 309 by changing the seat configuration in second class from 2+1 to 2+2. The information screens {{on the outside of}} the carriages were moved from the center of the carriages to next to the doors. There are also differences with the light switch logic, which often leads to the trains running with both front and tail lights on at the same end. The prototypes differed also originally by their <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> and Extra class features. They were modified in the mid-2000s to be similar to the series trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea of the}} Orient Express {{came from}} two sources: Fleming had {{returned}} from the Istanbul conference in 1955 by the train, but found the experience drab, partly because the <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> was closed. He also knew {{of the story of}} Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express: Karp was a US naval attaché and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg. Fleming had a long-standing interest in trains and, following his involvement in a near-fatal crash in 1927, associated them with danger; they also feature in Live and Let Die, Diamonds Are Forever and The Man with the Golden Gun.|$|E
50|$|Although most locomotive-hauled trains take power {{directly}} from the locomotive, there have been examples (mainly in continental Europe) where <b>restaurant</b> <b>cars</b> would take power {{directly from}} the overhead wires. For example, the German <b>restaurant</b> <b>cars</b> WRmz 135 (1969), WRbumz 139 (1975) and ARmz 211 (1971) were all equipped with pantograph.|$|R

25|$|The ICE 1 was {{originally}} {{equipped with a}} passenger information system based on BTX, however this system was eventually taped over and removed in the later refurbishment. The ICE 3 trains feature touch screen terminals in some carriages, enabling travellers to print train timetables. The system is also located in the <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> of the ICE 2.|$|E
25|$|In June 1993, an eight-car {{trainset}} {{was shipped}} from Bremerhaven to the United States. The trainset included two power cars, one first class car, two second class cars, one <b>restaurant</b> <b>car,</b> and one service car. Starting in April 1993. the train had been adapted to {{service on the}} Northeast Corridor. Changes included adaptations to the 11kV, 25Hz electrification system and changed wheel profiles.|$|E
50|$|In 2013 {{the project}} was scaled back, with the train length being reduced to nine cars by {{removing}} the luxury sleepers and <b>restaurant</b> <b>cars.</b> That resulted in a revised project cost of $204 million.|$|R

25|$|Since 1995, two ICE1 {{trainsets}} {{have been}} used as so-called idea trains ("Ideenzüge") on services from Hamburg to Basel and Stuttgart. These trainsets were used to test cellular repeaters, returnable bottles in the <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> and different concepts for in-train Internet access. Later these trainsets were used in regular ICE service, without tests being conducted. During the refurbishment, the additional installations were removed.|$|E
25|$|Refurbished {{trainsets}} {{consist of}} two power cars and 12 intermediate cars. These include four first class cars, including the service {{car with the}} conductors' compartment (numbered 9, 11, 12, 14), one <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> (8) and seven second class cars (1 to 7).

25|$|The {{purchase}} {{price of the}} first 41 trainsets ordered was about 1.8 billion DM, about 1.2 billion DM of which was for the electric equipment. The Bundesbahn claims to have reduced the price by about 300 million DM through negotiations. One power car cost 8.7 millions, a <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> four million, a service car three million and a regular intermediate car 2.7 million DM.|$|E
25|$|The {{exterior}} {{design is}} very {{similar to that of the}} ICE2. A major difference to all other ICE generations is the raised roof of the <b>restaurant</b> <b>car.</b> The ICE1 is the only ICE without electronic displays for route information of the outside; the car numbers are indicated by adhesive labels. ICE1 trainsets have car numbers ranging from 1 to 14, while all other ICE trains have car numbers from 21 to 44.|$|E

The ICE 1, the ICE 2 and seven-car ICE T (Class 411) are equipped with a full <b>restaurant</b> <b>car.</b> The five-car ICE T (Class 415) and ICE 3 however, have been designed without a restaurant, they feature a bistro coach instead. Since 1 October 2006, smoking is prohibited in the bistro coaches, similar to the restaurant cars, which have always been non-smoking.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinctive}} ICE {{design was}} developed {{by a team of}} designers around Alexander Neumeister in the early 1980s and first used on the InterCityExperimental (ICE V). The team around Neumeister then designed the ICE 1, ICE 2, and ICE 3/T/TD. The interior of the trains was designed by Jens Peters working for BPR-Design in Stuttgart. Among others, he was responsible for the heightened roof in the <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> and the special lighting. The same team also developed the design for the now discontinued InterRegio trains in the mid-1980s.|$|E
25|$|By 1938 {{there were}} still only four daytime through trains Monday to Friday, {{although}} there were considerably more summer Saturday trains, many of them going north to Stirling and beyond, and some originating from Liverpool. The stopping service on the route remained very thin indeed, although the Edinburgh line had more stopping trains. There were many more night trains, several of them seasonal, and many running {{to the north of}} Scotland. The 10.00 a.m. train from Euston was named The Royal Scot and took seven hours to Glasgow, and seven hours and five minutes to Edinburgh, advertised as conveying <b>restaurant</b> <b>car</b> to both terminals. The train called only at Carlisle intermediately.|$|E
