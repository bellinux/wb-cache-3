5|$|As Allied forces {{descended on}} Zagreb, Blažeković {{left the city}} on 6 May 1945 and fled from Slovenia into Austria.

On 28 August, American forces arrested him and sent him to a detainment camp before having him extradited to Yugoslavia on 12 February 1946. Blažeković was tried in Zagreb on 12 January 1947, sentenced to death, and executed the same day.|$|E

5|$|Howard Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after reading two articles involving suicides of servicemen in Haiti. The Haitian <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> was shot in a derelict building in a North Vancouver shipyard; originally, the producers wanted to set the episode in Haiti and actually film in the country.

40|$|Since <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> {{are meant}} to be {{temporary}} and setting them up usually require urgency, little attention has been given to provision of surface water drainage {{and to a lesser extent}} wastewater management. As the population of <b>refugees</b> in these <b>camps</b> continues to grow, the effectiveness of drainage infrastructure continues to diminish. In addition, availability of sufficient safe drinking water and wastewater management have become difficult in the <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> across the world. The present situation in <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> across the world, such as flooding and outbreak of water-related diseases in South Sudan <b>refugee</b> <b>camps,</b> has made the need for sustainable approach to solving the problems to be very urgent. One sustainable way of solving the problems of flooding and outbreak of diseases in <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> is to provide effective drainage and wastewater infrastructure that ensures all the wastewater are properly collected, treated and reused for various purposes such as agriculture, drinking, laundry and other relevant uses. This paper therefore presents the current state of drainage and wastewater management in two <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> and propose low-cost technologies for stormwater management, wastewater collection, treatment and potential reuse, suitable for these <b>refugee</b> <b>camps...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Refugee</b> <b>camps</b> {{serve as}} microcosms of poverty-stricken societies. While {{on a much}} smaller scale than an entire country, {{many of the same}} {{problems}} that plague the developing world also affect <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> and their inhabitants, and they are exacerbated by the close quarters, new environment, boredom, and lack of social order that often characterizes <b>refugee</b> <b>camps.</b> Specifically, women and children face many of the same issues in <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> as they do in urban slums and rural villages. While specific problems vary, broad issues such as inequality and abuse are seen universally.|$|R

5|$|The {{city has}} absorbed the coastal Deir al-Balah <b>Refugee</b> <b>Camp,</b> {{although}} it remains outside of Deir al-Balah's municipal administration.

Most Palestine {{refugees in}} Jordan, but not all, have full citizenship", following Jordan's annexation and {{occupation of the}} West Bank. The percentage of Palestinian refugees living in <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> to those who settled outside the camps is the lowest of all UNRWA fields of operations. Palestine refugees are allowed access to public services and healthcare, as a result, <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> are becoming more like poor city suburbs than <b>refugee</b> <b>camps.</b> Most Palestine <b>refugees</b> {{moved out of the}} camps {{to other parts of the}} country and the number of people registered in <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> as of January 2015 is 385,418, who live in ten <b>refugee</b> <b>camps.</b> This caused UNRWA to reduce the budget allocated to Palestine <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> in Jordan. Former UNRWA chief-attorney James G. Lindsay says: [...] "In Jordan, where 2 million Palestinian refugees live, all but 167,000 have citizenship, and are fully eligible for government services including education and health care." [...] Lindsay suggests that eliminating services to refugees whose needs are subsidized by Jordan [...] "would reduce the refugee list by 40%".|$|R

Schapira also obtained, from a Palestinian journalist, {{what appeared to be}} footage of him arriving at the hospital on a stretcher. During an emotional public funeral in the Bureij <b>refugee</b> <b>camp,</b> Muhammad was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and buried before sundown on the day of his death, in accordance with Muslim tradition.|$|E

40|$|<b>Refugee</b> <b>camps</b> are {{regarded}} as temporary settlements,organised according to the functionality of humanitarian operations.

50|$|It was {{important}} that refugees were protected and that the humanitarian character of <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> preserved. The Security Council recognised the experience African countries had in dealing with <b>refugees</b> and <b>refugee</b> <b>camps.</b> There was insecurity in some camps due {{to the presence of}} armed groups which did not qualify for international protection, differences within the refugee population, crime, banditry, and the flow of weapons. It emphasised the need to assist African countries to provide security for refugees, maintain the humanitarian character of <b>refugee</b> <b>camps</b> and protect vulnerable groups such as women, children and the elderly.|$|R

5|$|Just before Jaffa was conquered by Israeli {{troops in}} April 1948, the family fled {{to their house}} near Majdal, but the Jewish militias arrived there too, {{and they had to}} flee again.

Melman writes that the family spent nine months living in tents, {{dependent}} on UNRWA for an allowance of oil, rice and potatoes. The experience had a powerful effect on Abu Nidal.|$|E
5|$|Tension between Tutsi and Hutu {{had been}} {{escalating}} during the 1950s, and {{culminated in the}} 1959 Rwandan Revolution.

Kagame's family abandoned their home, living {{for two years in}} the far northeast of Rwanda and eventually crossing the border into Uganda. They moved gradually north, and settled in the Nshungerezi <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> in the Toro sub-region in 1962. It was around this time that, as young boys, Kagame and his future comrade, Fred Rwigyema, first met one another.|$|E
5|$|The {{implementation}} of stringent rules that require Vietnamese arrivals {{to qualify for}} refugee status prompted {{some of them to}} opt for the voluntary repatriation programme; between 1,000 and 2,000 arrivals to Malaysia returned to Vietnam in 1989. Refugees who opted to return to Vietnam were provided with a monthly stipend for up to one year by the UNHCR. In the early 1990s, as Vietnam began to experience economic growth, the number of refugee arrivals to Malaysia dropped. Joint collaborations between Malaysia, Vietnam and UNHCR to address the problem enabled Malaysia {{to reduce the size of}} its Vietnamese refugee populace, facilitating the closure of the Pulau Bidong <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> in November 1991. 3,000 Vietnamese refugees participated in the voluntary repatriation programme, and Malaysia's refugee populace reduced to 6,000 by 1994. Most of the remaining arrivals were not able to pass the UNHCR screening process and were classified as illegal immigrants. The majority of them expressed their reluctance to be repatriated to Vietnam; demonstrations and rioting broke out when news of the camp's impending closure was announced in 1995. Sungei Besi <b>refugee</b> <b>camp</b> was later closed in June 1996. The last refugees returned to Vietnam in 2005.|$|E
