An adaptive hierarchical therapy control framework which integrates the patient’s real biomechanical state estimation with task‐performance quantitative evaluation is proposed. Firstly, a high‐level progressive resistive supervisory controller is designed to determine the <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> base for each training session based on the patient’s online task‐performance evaluation. Then, a low‐level adaptive <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> triggered controller is presented to further regulate the interactive <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> corresponding to the patient’s real‐time biomechanical state ‐ characterized by the patient’s bio‐damping and bio‐stiffness in the course of one training session, so that the patient is challenged in a moderate but engaging and motivating way. Finally, a therapeutic robot system using a Barrett WAMTM compliant manipulator is set up. We recruited eighteen inpatient and outpatient stroke participants who were randomly allocated in experimental (robot‐aided) and control (conventional physical therapy) groups and enrolled for sixteen weeks of progressive resistance training. The preliminary results show that the proposed therapy control strategies can enhance the recovery of strength and motor control ability...|$|R

The spatial distributions of vegetation types indicate subsequent erosional state. In this study, we examined the ecological and morphological characteristics of colonized plant communities in six years old landslide scars. The morphological characteristics of plants like cover, root features, biomass, root: shoot ratio, pullout <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> for individual grass species are investigated. The landslides scars have slope gradients of about 34 - 36 0 with soil depth range from 0. 3 to 0. 6 m. In some cases during six years periods 60 - 70 % of landslide scars area was covered by herbaceous plants. The quadrat sampling method was done to examine quantitative vegetative attributes (relative density, relative frequency and relative cover). The Important Value Index (IVI) of an individual plant was identified to know the relative dominance. The plant types colonized was influenced by landscape orientation i. e., aspect. The pullout <b>resistive</b> <b>force</b> of different grass species was ranged between 6 to 49 Newton.

Muscular hydrostats are typically {{supported by a}} membrane of connective tissue which holds the volume constant. Retaining a constant volume enables the fibers to stabilize the muscle’s structure that would otherwise require skeletal support.

50|$|In fluid dynamics, drag (sometimes called air resistance, {{a type of}} {{friction}}, or fluid resistance, {{another type}} of friction or fluid friction) is a force acting opposite to the relative motion of any object moving {{with respect to a}} surrounding fluid. This can exist between two fluid layers (or surfaces) or a fluid and a solid surface. Unlike other <b>resistive</b> <b>forces,</b> such as dry friction, which are nearly independent of velocity, drag forces depend on velocity.Drag force is proportional to the velocity for a laminar flow and the squared velocity for a turbulent flow. Even though the ultimate cause of a drag is viscous friction, the turbulent drag is independent of viscosity.|$|E
50|$|Semi-aquatic animals {{compared}} to fully aquatic animals exhibit exacerbation of drag. Design {{that allows them}} to function out of the water limits the efficiency possible to be reached when in the water. In water swimming at the surface exposes them to resistive wave drag and is associated with a higher cost than submerged swimming. Swimming below the surface exposes them to resistance due to return strokes and pressure, but primarily friction. Frictional drag is due to fluid viscosity and morphology characteristics. Pressure drag is due to the difference of water flow around the body and is also affected by body morphology. Semi-aquatic organisms encounter increased <b>resistive</b> <b>forces</b> when in or out of the water, as they are not specialized for either habitat. The morphology of otters and beavers, for example, must meet needs for both environments. Their fur decreases streamlining and creates additional drag. The platypus may be a good example of an intermediate between drag and lift swimmers because it has been shown to have a rowing mechanism which is similar to lift-based pectoral oscillation. The limbs of semi-aquatic organisms are reserved for use on land and using them in water not only increases the cost of locomotion, but limits them to drag-based modes.Although they are less efficient, drag swimmers are able to produce more thrust at low speeds than lift swimmers. They are also thought to be better for maneuverability due to the large thrust produced.|$|E

A major contributing factor to these nonlinearities is {{the formation of a}} shallow groove on the agar surface. We measured both the adhesion forces that cause the worm’s body to settle into the agar and the resulting dynamics of groove formation. Furthermore, we quantified the locomotive forces produced by C.  elegans undulatory motions on a wet viscoelastic agar surface.

Male international karate practitioners volunteered as participants (n = 11). Body density was calculated using hydrostatic weighing procedures with fat mass ascertained from body density values. Participants were required to pedal maximally on a cycle ergometer (Monark 864) against randomly assigned loads ranging from 70 g·kg- 1 - 95 g·kg- 1 (using a TBM or FFM protocol) for 8 seconds. The resistive force that produced the highest peak power output (PPO) for each protocol was considered optimal. Differences (p 0. 05) were observed between time to PPO, or heart rate when the TBM and FFM protocols were compared. The findings of this study suggest that when high intensity cycle ergometer <b>resistive</b> <b>forces</b> are derived from FFM, greater peak powers can be obtained consistently in karate athletes. <b>Resistive</b> <b>forces</b> that relate to the active muscle tissue utilised during this type of exercise may need to be explored in preference to protocols that include both lean and fat masses.
