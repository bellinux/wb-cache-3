2500|$|Lone Wolf is {{a series}} of 29 gamebooks, created by Joe Dever and {{initially}} illustrated (books 1-8) by Gary Chalk. [...] The series was first published in July 1984 and sold more than 9 million copies worldwide. The story focuses on the fictional world of Magnamund, where the forces of good and evil fight for control of the planet. The protagonist is Lone Wolf, last of his caste of warrior monks known as Kai Lords. The book series is written in the second person and recounts Lone Wolf's adventures as if the reader is the main character. As Lone Wolf, the <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> choices at regular intervals throughout the story which then change the course, and the final outcome, of the book.|$|E
2500|$|The {{optional}} writing section, {{which is}} always administered {{at the end of}} the test, is 40 minutes long (increasing from the original 30 minute time limit on the September 2015 test). Essays must be in response to a given prompt. The prompts are about broad social issues (changing from the old prompts which were directly applicable to teenagers) and students must analyze three different perspectives given, and show how their opinion relates to these perspectives. The essay does not affect the composite score or the English section score. It is only given as a separate writing score and is included in the ELA score. No particular essay structure is required. [...] Two trained readers assign each essay subscores between 1 and 6 in four different categories: Ideas and Analysis, Development and Support, Organization, Language Use and Conventions. Scores of 0 are reserved for essays that are blank, off-topic, non-English, not written with a no. 2 pencil, or considered illegible after several attempts at reading. The subscores from the two different readers are summed to produce final domain scores from 2 to 12 (or 0) in each of the four categories. [...] If the two readers' subscores differ by more than one point, then a senior third <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> the final decision on the score. The four domain scores are combined through a process that has not been described to create a writing section score between 1 and 36. Note that the domain scores are not added to create the writing section score.|$|E

5000|$|There is no set [...] "end" [...] to the story. Rather {{there are}} {{multiple}} nodes that {{provide a sense of}} closure for the reader. In one such [...] "ending", Emily appears to die. However, in another [...] "ending", she comes home safe from the war. How the story plays out depends on the choices the <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> during their navigation of the text. The passage of time is uncertain as the reader can find nodes that focus on the present, flashbacks or even dreams and the nodes are frequently presented in a non-linear fashion. The choices the <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> can lead them to focus on individual characters, meaning that while there are a series of characters in the story the characters focused on can change with each reading, or a particular place.|$|E

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} mechanisms underlying analogical transfer in the clue-word reading task developed by Goswami and her colleagues. Across both experiments, an equivalent number of "analogy" responses were made {{regardless of whether}} the clue word was seen or just heard. In addition, the number of "analogy" responses to words sharing both orthographic and phonological overlap with the clue words was no greater than that shown to words sharing only pronunciations. These results provide no evidence for the view that beginning <b>readers</b> <b>make</b> genuine orthographic-based analogies. Instead, the findings are interpreted within a framework in which phonological priming, in combination with the children's own partial decoding attempts based on limited orthographic knowledge, account for their performance on the clue-word task. It is concluded that the extent to which beginning <b>readers</b> <b>make</b> orthographic analogies is overestimated and as a consequence, theories that emphasize the importance of orthographic analogy as a mechanism driving the development of early reading skills need to be questioned...|$|R
50|$|In a game book, the <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> {{choices to}} effect {{the outcome of the}} story. Lone Wolf books rely on a {{combination}} of thought and luck. Certain statistics such as combat skill and endurance attributes are determined randomly before play (reading). The player then chooses which Kai disciplines or skills they possess. This number depends directly on how many books in the series have been completed ("Kai rank"). With each additional book, the player chooses one additional Kai discipline. In this first book, the player starts with five disciplines.|$|E
50|$|The Nintendo Adventure Book {{series of}} 12 books was {{published}} from 1991 to 1992 by Simon and Schuster in the United States and Archway Books and Mammoth Books in the United Kingdom.

5000|$|The {{novel is}} written in Second-person {{narrative}} and allows the reader to direct where the story will go, similar to the Choose Your Own Adventure book series.

After {{an introduction to the}} story, the reader is asked to determine the protagonist's next course of action.

Adherence to no particular style is also a style in its own right; some may think it undesirable, others not.|$|R
5000|$|Wolfgang Iser {{exemplifies the}} German {{tendency}} to theorize {{the reader and}} so posit a uniform response. For him, a literary work is not an object in itself but an effect to be explained. But he asserts this response {{is controlled by the}} text. For the [...] "real" [...] reader, he substitutes an implied reader, who is the reader a given literary work requires. Within various polarities created by the text, this [...] "implied" [...] <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> expectations, meanings, and the unstated details of characters and settings through a [...] "wandering viewpoint". In his model, the text controls. The reader's activities are confined within limits set by the literary work.|$|E

50|$|Plot {{generators}} {{were described}} {{as early as the}} 1930s. In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, Robert J.

The item to use from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. Hogan also mentions other similar devices called The 36 Dramatic Situations and Plotto: The Master Book of All Plots. Plotto by William Wallace Cook is a non-random plot generator. The <b>reader</b> <b>makes</b> all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.|$|E
