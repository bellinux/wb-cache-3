50|$|The tapered {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, {{with a long}} open cockpit reaching from leading to trailing edge. The pilot sat at the front immediately behind the engine. Seats {{for one or two}} passengers could be fitted in the rear with access via a triangular shaped starboard side door. The tailplane was mounted on top of the fuselage and carried horn balanced elevators. The combination of a triangular fin and straight edged rudder, which extended {{down to the bottom of}} the fuselage in a cut out between the elevators, gave the vertical surface a rather pointed look. The main undercarriage legs, with prominent shock absorbers, were mounted on the upper fuselage longerons. Two bracing <b>struts</b> <b>reached</b> forward to the lower fuselage below the engine and the wheels were linked by a hinged axle centrally mounted to the lower fuselage with further struts.|$|R
40|$|Disordered {{networks}} {{are found in}} many natural and artificial materials, from gels or cytoskeletal structures to metallic foams or bones. Here, the energy distribution {{in this type of}} networks is modeled, taking into account the orientation of the struts. A correlation between the orientation and the energy per unit volume is found and described {{as a function of the}} connectivity in the network and the relative bending stiffness of the struts. If one or both parameters have relatively large values, the struts aligned in the loading direction present the highest values of energy. On the contrary, if these have relatively small values, the highest values of energy can be <b>reached</b> in the <b>struts</b> oriented transversally. This result allows explaining in a simple way remodeling processes in biological materials, for example, the remodeling of trabecular bone and the reorganization in the cytoskeleton. Additionally, the correlation between the orientation, the affinity, and the bending-stretching ratio in the network is discussed...|$|R
50|$|The tapered {{fuselage}} {{was flat}} sided, with the pilot's cockpit {{placed under the}} leading edge with a second cockpit immediately behind and under the wing. The latter was accessed via starboard side door. The tailplane was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carried horn balanced elevators. The fin was triangular, carrying a flat topped rudder which extended {{down to the bottom of}} the fuselage in a cut out between the elevators; the latter were aerodynamically balanced but the rudder was not.

Two bracing <b>struts</b> <b>reached</b> forward to the lower fuselage below the engine and the wheels were linked by a hinged axle centrally mounted to the lower fuselage with further struts. The T 23 was powered by an 80 hp (60 kW) Le Rhône rotary engine, enclosed in a fully circular cowling of moderate chord, driving a two-bladed propeller.|$|R
40|$|The Vicario Viaduct {{is located}} in the A- 44 motorway, in the South-East part of Spain. It crosses a natural gorge, near the town of Ízbor in the {{province}} of Granada. A single continuous steel concrete composite deck, 24 m wide and 175 m long, divided in two 87, 5 m spans, has been built. The cross section is a single structural steel box, 8, 00 m wide and 4, 52 m deep. The total width of 24 m is <b>reached</b> adding a <b>strut</b> and tie system each 4, 375 m {{on both sides of the}} box. The steel parts of the deck were entirely constructed in the workshop and then they were erected on site just behind one of the abutments. Finally a 27. 5 m long steel nose was connected to launch the deck. The main problems have been the curved shape of the deck (1420 m radius in plan) producing a non symmetric transverse distribution of reactions on each support and the cantilever reaching 87, 5 m long, producing a maximum deflection of 1500 m...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} {{and strength of}} five simply supported reinforced concrete beams with different stirrup detailing and one pretensioned concrete beam are evaluated using the strut-tie model approach {{with the aid of}} the interactive computer graphics program. In addition, two design examples, squat shear walls subjected to large lateral forces, are presented to demonstrate that the strut-tie model approach with graphics capabilities can provide simple solutions for a large number of design situations dealing with structural concretes. The strut-tie model approach as a conceptual model is found instrumental in understanding the function of both concrete and steel reinforcement. It not only provides a visual representation of the essential aspects of structural loading carrying mechanisms, but also provides useful tools for structural detailing and dimensioning. ^ The interactive computer graphics program with nonlinear analysis capability, which implements the strut-tie model approach for the analysis and design of structural concrete, is developed. The graphics program consists of three parts. The first part is considered as a pre- and post-processor to a nonlinear finite element analysis program for solving plane solid problems. The second part enables the user to develop strut-tie models interactively {{based on the results of}} the first part. This part is also considered as a pre- and post-processor to a nonlinear finite element program for solving plane truss problems. The third part is a design routine for dimensioning and detailing the components (struts, ties and nodes) of the developed strut-tie model using the resulting forces from the second part. The use of interactive computer graphics program incorporated with finite element nonlinear analysis programs is shown to be efficient in the development, analysis and detailing of strut-tie models for design, and analysis of reinforced and prestressed concrete members including disturbed regions. ^ For a more accurate prediction of nonlinear structural behavior, a finite element nonlinear formulation which is implemented in the interactive computer graphics program is developed based on the consistent continuum mechanics approach. In the formulation, the updated material reference frame is employed so that the true stress-strain test can be directly applied to correctly characterize properties of materials which undergo nonlinear deformations. ^ Since the compressive strength of concrete is affected by several factors such as disturbance caused by cracks and reinforcement, confinement and multiaxial state of stress, it is not possible to have all the concrete <b>struts</b> <b>reach</b> simultaneously a unique peak value of compressive strength. In this study, a general and consistent approach for determining the effective strengths of concrete struts is developed by implementing the principal stress ratios obtained from the finite element analysis for the corresponding strut and nodal regions. ...|$|R
40|$|Concrete deep beams with a shear span to depth {{ratio of}} less than 2. 32 [73] will work as tied arches after {{flexural}} cracking, provided there is sufficient reinforcement. The compression strut formed between the support and the loading points is under biaxial compressive and tensile stresses. The current Canadian Code [5] stipulates that deep beams and corbels should be designed using the Strut-and-Tie Method. This method incorporates the work done by Collins and Mitchell [8][9] where the cracked concrete behaves as a new material and that the compressive strength of concrete is reduced due to strain-softening. Here-in lies an area of discrepancy. The work done by Collins and Mitchell utilizes beam theory which requires that plane sections remain plane. However, deep beams and corbels are classified as "regions of discontinuity" consequently beam theory {{does not apply to}} these structures. An area of the Canadian code which needs to be examined is the dimensioning of the compression strut. To date there is no clear explanation as to how the design guidelines of the compression strut were developed. A weakness of the design code is that numerous assumptions must be made. The designer first assumes that the compression <b>strut</b> <b>reaches</b> a maximum concrete strain of 0. 002 [5], and then must assume the strains in the tension ties. The focus of this research has been to investigate diagonal splitting strength of reinforced concrete deep beams. In conducting this study, twelve deep beams, categorized in four groups were tested. The test variables included the shear span, the amount of web reinforcement and the concrete compressive strength. Surprisingly, no researcher has published measured strain incurred by the compression strut in deep beams. In our research, a single beam from each of the four test groups was fitted with strain gauges to measure the tensile strain in the main tensile reinforcement. As well, the concrete strains along the main diagonal formed between the support and the loading points as well as perpendicular to the strut were measured. The experimental work demonstrated the development of diagonal cracking. These cracks appeared above the supports and propagated towards the loading points. The strain gauges on the concrete surface confirmed that the stresses along the compression strut were under biaxial compression tension stresses. A finite element analysis determined that the compression stress acting parallel to the diagonal were uniform in distribution and symmetrical. Perpendicular to the diagonal, high compressive stresses were seen at the supports and the loading points. However, the stresses in between these areas were uniformly distributed in tension. The measured compressive strains were much less than the recommended value of 0. 002, and the compression strut was found to be much wider than that defined by the Canadian Code. As a consequence of these the findings, a truss model was defined using a biaxial concrete strength envelope. This truss model was applied to the test beams of this study as well as too ninety-nine test beams available in literature. In all cases, the truss model was able to accurately predict the strength of these test beams...|$|R
