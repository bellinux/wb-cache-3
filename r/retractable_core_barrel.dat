40|$|The HDR {{experimental}} {{facility has}} been used for several blowdown experiments in order to study fluid-structure interactions and loadings on the pressure vessel internal structures of a pressurized water reactor. We have developed the code FLUX to analyse the motions in the initial blowdown period. This paper describes a new type of HDR experiments (V 34) and compares the experimental results with the FLUX-code results. As novel feature, the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> is not rigidly clamped to the vessel as in earlier experiments but supported with gaps such that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> can move freely upwards for about 2 mm and horizontally for 0. 3 mm at the upper flange. At the lower core-barrel edge, snubbers restrict the horizontal motion to about + 1. 4 mm and − 2. 8 mm. The experimental results show that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> is deflected sidewards until it hits the snubber at the lower edge and then swings back to hit the opposite snubber. By this some kinetic energy is lost due to plastic snubber deformations. At the same time, the measurements show that the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> lifts rather uniformly from its support upwards until it hits the upper constraint. Several bounces up and down are observed until the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> becomes fixed probably due to friction from the side. This situation has been pre- and post-computed with the new FLUX-version which contains a very effective algorithm to treat supports with gaps and resultant impacts. For treatment of plastic supports, a simple model is added. Pre-computations were not meaningful because of large deviations in the pre-estimated initials gaps. However the computed pressure-field is not influenced very much by these parameters and predicted very well. This was favoured by the isothermal fluid initial conditions. Post-computations show sufficient agreement with respect to computed <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion. The axial motion is described very well. Some problems remain which are due to the model for the upper flange support. Impacts do not results in greatly enlarged loadings, strains or accelerations for this situation...|$|R
40|$|Surveillance of <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> {{vibrations}} {{has been}} {{performed in the}} Swedish Ringhals PWRs for several years. This surveillance is focused mainly on the pendular motion of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel,</b> which {{is known as the}} beam mode. The monitoring of the beam mode has suggested that its amplitude increases along the cycle and decreases after refuelling. In the last 5 years several measurements have been taken in order to understand this behaviour. Besides, a non-linear fitting procedure has been implemented in order to better distinguish the different components of vibration. By using this fitting procedure, two modes of vibration have been identified in the frequency range of the beam mode. Several results coming from the trend analysis performed during these years indicate that one of the modes is due to the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion itself and the other is due to the individual flow induced vibrations of the fuel elements.

40|$|Surveillance and {{diagnostics}} of <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> vibrations {{has been}} {{performed in the}} Swedish Ringhals PWRs for several years, with main focus on the pendular motion (beam mode). The monitoring of the beam mode showed that the amplitude of the corresponding peak in the ex-core neutron spectra increases along the cycle, and decreases after refueling. Previous investigations on the reason of this behaviour, i. e. whether it {{is due to the}} increase of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> vibration amplitude or to the increase of the neutron physics coupling between vibrations and neutron noise, were not decisive. The objective of the work reported here is to clarify this question. From frequency analysis, two modes of vibration have been identi-fied in the frequency range of the beam mode. Several results coming from the trend analysis performed during recent years indicate that one of the modes is due to the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion itself and remains constant during cycle, and the other is due to the indi-vidual flow induced vibrations of the fuel elements, showing an increasing trend during the cycle. In this work, the method to separate the contributions from the two modes has been refined, and the results of this approach to the latest measurements are presented. The results confirm the origin of the two vibration modes and show constant amplitude of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion throughout the cycle...|$|R
40|$|This work investigates if a {{movement}} of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> in a pressurized water reactor may give rise to pressure pulses inside the reactor pressure vessel. The results are then evaluated with regards to which positions {{it would be best}} suitable to measure said pressure pulsation. The investigation is meant to conclude if it is plausible to use these pulsations to determine if the lower radial supports are working properly, securing the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> in place, stopping it from vibrating/moving. The lower supports have a maximum allowed gap between the clevis insert ant the lower radial support, this gap is known to be larger than intended but still below the upper allowed limit. If the gap would grow as large as it is allowed, would it should then be possible to measure this from the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> vibrations made possible from this gap. There are only certain positions where these measurements can be done, is it possible to se pressure pulses at these positions? From an initial heavily simplified model this seems to be the case, forcing vibrations with a certain frequency of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> gives rise to a small fluctuation of about 0. 009 MPa at the locations of interest. These pulsations show an almost linear relation between the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> displacement and peak to peak pressure amplitude. A more detailed model was used for the final simulation. This model confirms the results from the simplified model, showing a slightly larger pressure pulse in several of the guide tube positions. The peak to peak amplitude is about 0. 002 MPa. The maximum fluctuations are occurring close to the periphery of the reactor pressure vessel, with both of the models. This suggests that it would be beneficial to measure the fluctuations at such a position...|$|R

Seabed soil sampling is crucial in deep-water engineering projects or geological studies where a detailed knowledge of the seabed geology is required. Deep-sea vibrocoring {{is a relatively new}} offshore sampling technique. The system consists of a vertical, tubular <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> with a sharp cutting edge at its lower end vibrated into the seabed by a high-frequency, low-amplitude vibratory motor. In the past, success of a coring operation has been judged primarily by the length of the recovered core.

40|$|The Division of Subatomic Physics and Plasma Physics (formerly Division of Nuclear Engineering) in Chalmers, Göteborg, and the Ringhals Nuclear Plant have {{investigated}} the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> vibrations in the Ringhals PWRs over the last 20 years. Based on the different symmetry properties of the vibration modes, a mode separation technique was developed to enhance the contributions from the different modes. Recent observations of wear at both the lower and upper core-barrel-support structures in the Ringhals PWRs indicated that vibration modes of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> other than pendular (beam mode) and shell mode are likely to occur. A beam mode type movement alone {{is not able to}} explain such a wear, and therefore, it is fair to assume that the vibration mode in question is a small amplitude periodic tilting movement of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> around a horizontal, diagonal pivot at the half height of the core. In this work, ex-core data taken in the Ringhals- 4 PWR were analyzed in order to find evidence of such a tilting movement. First, cross spectra between various ex-core detectors were calculated and analyzed to locate the frequency range of the new vibrational mode. Then, a model based on symmetry considerations was derived in order to extract the sought mode from the spectra. The measurements were evaluated by the new mode enhancement technique.

Drilling of 1200 to 1800 metres is common and at these depths, ground is mainly hard rock.

40|$|It is recognized, {{that the}} matrix {{condition}} number plays {{important role in}} the error of estimation of <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion. Matrix condition numbers were estimated for the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> movement measured in Paks NPP, Kalinin NPP and Borssele NPP. Results show, that spectral decomposition leads to an increases the statistical error. It is suggested to eliminate one of the freedom of the system, before making spectral decomposition. 1 SPECTRAL DECOMPOSITION The <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion can be detected and evaluated from the fluctuation measured by ex–core neutron detectors arranged around the reactor vessel of a NPP (see [8], [11], [12], [3]). The basis of the method is very simple. Due to any layer between the core and biological shielding with thickness of ∆x and attenuation coefficient µ an attenuation of neutron fluxes occurs (see [4], [1]). Figure 1. shows the typical arrangement of ex–core neutron detectors in a PWR. It is clear that one of the possible force for a pendular motion is the jet of coolant from the loops. The pendular movement causes a variation δx(t) of gap ∆x. It is also well known, that there is always some reactivity perturbation in the core. On the basis of these two noise sources a method of spectral decomposition has been elaborated by Dragt and Turkcan [4]. In that model the signal measured by neutron detector consists of two parts: • reactivity fluctuation • pendular <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> motion. The direction of the motion can differ {{from the direction of the}} given neutron detector. In this case the given detector will sense only a projection of the motion. 1 HEJ: ANM- 011125 -A 2 According to the original idea of spectral decomposition method [4] the signal of any ex– core detector can be written as: i(t) = δr(t) + µ δy(t) cos (Θi −Θ′) + w(t) (1) δr(t) – is the reactivity fluctuation independent from CBM δy(t) – is the amplitude of CBM Θi – is the direction of the given detector Θ – is the direction of CBM w(t) – white noise from electronics From here Dragt and Türkcan [4] got the cross power spectral density between any pairs of ex–core neutron detectors.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{calculation}} of the in-core neutron noise induced by the shell-mode vibrations of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel.</b> The original motivation was to investigate whether an out-of-phase behavior can exist between the in-core and ex-core (ex-vessel) detectors lying at the same azimuthal position. To this end, a two-region two-group diffusion model was used in one dimension. The noise was calculated by representing the vibrations of the <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> by a model developed earlier to describe control rod vibrations. It was found that such an out-of-phase behavior indeed exists, although only for in-core detector positions close to the core boundary. This behavior is due to the local component of the noise, which is accounted for in a two-group treatment. The finding is in accordance with the experiment whose result prompted the present work. In addition to its effect on the phase, the local component also manifests itself by a large amplitude of the noise around the vibrating core boundary, i. e., in both the core and the reflector. The appearance and the properties of the local component of the neutron noise for core-barrel vibrations is the main finding of this paper.

Emphasis is placed on distinguishing between the lithologic factors influencing the geophysical signals and artifacts resulting from imperfect data collection. Good overall agreement between core and log data for rotary <b>core</b> <b>barrel</b> <b>cored</b> sediments at Hole 959 D is observed, and effects of core expansion caused by the removal of overburden pressure do not appear significant.
