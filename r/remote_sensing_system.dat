40|$|A {{review of}} <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> {{technology}} for lower tropospheric thermodynamic (TD) profiling is presented with focus on high accuracy and high temporal-vertical resolution. The contributions of these instruments {{to the understanding}} of the Earth system are assessed with respect to radiative transfer, land surface-atmosphere feedback, convection initiation, and data assimilation. We demonstrate that for progress in weather and climate research, TD profilers are essential. These observational systems must resolve gradients of humidity and temperature in the stable or unstable atmospheric surface layer close to the ground, in the mixed layer, in the interfacial layer—usually characterized by an inversion—and the lower troposphere. A thorough analysis of the current observing systems is performed revealing significant gaps that must be addressed to fulfill existing needs. We analyze whether current and future passive and active <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> can close these gaps. A methodological analysis and demonstration of measurement capabilities with respect to bias and precision is executed both for passive and active <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> including passive infrared and microwave spectroscopy, the global navigation satellite system, as well as water vapor and temperature Raman lidar and water vapor differential absorption lidar. Whereas passive <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> are already mature with respect to operational applications, active <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> require further engineering to become operational in networks.

40|$|Earth {{observation}} is diversifying, and now includes {{new types of}} systems, such as citizen observatories, unmanned aerial vehicles and wireless sensor networks. However, the Copernicus Programme vision of a seamless chain from satellite data to usable information {{in the hands of}} decision makers is still largely unrealized, and <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> science lacks a conceptual framework to explain why. This paper reviews the literatures on citizen science, citizen observatories and conceptualization of <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems.</b> It then proposes a Conceptual Framework for Earth Observation which {{can be used in a}} new Earth observation science to explain blockages in the chain from collecting data to disseminating information in any Earth observation <b>system,</b> including <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems.</b> The framework differs from its predecessors by including social variables as well as technological and natural ones. It is used here, with evidence from successful citizen science projects, to compare the factors that are likely to influence the effectiveness of satellite <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> and citizen observatories. The paper finds that constraints on achieving the seamless “Copernicus Chain” are not solely technical, as assumed in the new Space Strategy for Europe, but include social constraints too. Achieving the Copernicus Chain will depend on the balance between: (a) the ‘forward’ momentum generated by the repetitive functioning of each component in the system, as a result of automatic operation or human institutions, and by the efficiency of interfaces between components; and (b) the ‘backward’ flow of information on the information needs of end users. Citizen observatories will face challenges in components which for satellite <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> are: (a) automatic or straightforward, e. g., sensor design and launch, data collection, and data products; and (b) also challenging, e. g., data processing. Since citizen observatories will rely even more on human institutions than <b>remote</b> <b>sensing</b> <b>systems</b> to achieve repetitive functioning, one of their greatest strengths—using a “crowd” of hand-held sensors to cover large areas—could also be one of their greatest weaknesses...|$|R

The ability to understand system sensitivities also supports the best use of an operational system and is thus desirable.
