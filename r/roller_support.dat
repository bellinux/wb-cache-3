5000|$|When {{drawing the}} {{conjugate}} beam {{it is important}} that the shear and moment developed at the supports of the conjugate beam account for the corresponding slope and displacement of the real beam at its supports, a consequence of Theorems 1 and 2. For example, as shown below, a pin or <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> at the end of the real beam provides zero displacement, but a non zero slope. Consequently, from Theorems 1 and 2, the conjugate beam must be supported by a pin or a roller, since this support has zero moment but has a shear or end reaction. When the real beam is fixed supported, both the slope and displacement are zero. Here the conjugate beam has a free end, since at this end there is zero shear and zero moment. Corresponding real and conjugate supports are shown below.

40|$|Free undamped {{in-plane}} vibrations of shear undeformable beams {{around their}} highly buckled configurations are investigated neglecting rotary inertia effects. The beams are inertially nonuniform since a lumped mass is rigidly clamped along the span. Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} boundary conditions in the post-buckling phases. First, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other end, a <b>roller</b> <b>support,</b> both in the buckling and post-buckling phases.

Two mechanical models are considered {{depending on the}} assumed boundary conditions in the buckling and post-buckling phases. Namely, with the first model, the beam is considered inextensible because it is hinged {{at one end and}} is acted upon by an axial compressive force on the other end, a <b>roller</b> <b>support.</b> In the second case, the beam is assumed inextensible in the buckling phase (same boundary conditions as above), however, it is considered extensible in the subsequent post-buckling phase because the <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> is changed into a hinged end. The post-buckling solution is obtained with three approaches: asymptotic, numerical via evaluation of an elliptic integral, and numerical via finite-element formulation (FEM). Due to the non-constant curvature, the equations of motion governing linear vibrations around the post-buckling configuration are linear partial-differential equations with non-constant coefficients and the solutions for the frequencies and mode shapes are found employing two approximate approaches: a fully numerical FEM approach and a semi-analytical method based on a weak formulation (Galerkin method) implemented in an in-house built code. The main results are compared and a close agreement in the outcomes is found. The leading mechanical differences in the linear normal modes of the two prestressed elastica arch models and their potential influence on nonlinear vibrations are discussed.

40|$|An {{emergency}} {{situation in a}} continuous transport system is an undesirable phenomenon during which the continuity of production or technological processes is seriously endangered. This situation can be brought about by various factors. In technological equipment of environmental continuous belt conveyor systems and pipe conveyors various adverse critical conditions may arise, which may result {{in the creation of}} an {{emergency situation}}. In particular, both conveyor and supporting rollers being the most significant components of the conveyor belt can substantially contribute to the onset of an emergency situation.

This contribution describes the possibility of the measurement and assessment of normal contact forces, which are applied by the conveyor belt to the supporting rollers on the hexagonal idler <b>roller</b> <b>support</b> of the pipe conveyors.

40|$|The project {{which is}} {{presented}} in this report {{is focused on the}} positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> connected to the Kiln in one of the pelletizing plants in Kiruna at LKAB. Kiln is a rotating oven where the pellets are sintered, {{which is one of the}} steps in the pelletizing process. The <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are used to position Kiln in an axial or vertical direction, by either skewing the rollers or positioning the whole center of the rollers towards or away from the Kiln. The plan for this project is to be used as a preparatory work for a construction of an atomized system for adjustment of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> for Kiln at LKAB in Kiruna. An atomized adjustment system can possibly simplify the procedure of Kiln positioning, increase the lifespan of the system and increase the reliability of the whole system. This report can also lead to improvements by being used as a support during positioning of <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> A <b>support</b> system for Kiln positioning can contribute to avoid production disturbances. Product disturbances can occur because of damaged components such as damaged support wheels or parts of the Kiln driveline. Less production disturbances increases the availability of the Grate-Kiln plant and thereby increases the profitability for LKAB. The aim of this project has been to develop a calculation model which can show the reactions of Kiln when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted. The assignment was also to include the heating and cooling of Kiln and to have considerations regarding the gear contact in the driveline. One part of the assignment was also to document the damages that can occur because of inaccurate positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> The final step in this project was to propose optimized positions for the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> This project is the final assignment before examination from the M. Sc Student in Mechanical Engineering program at the University of Technology in Luleå LTU in Sweden. The main part of this project has been to develop a calculation model. The calculation model is built in a Matlab script. In this Matlab script there are essentially six parts of the script that can be varied, and these parts are:- The temperatures in the system- The dimensions of components- The load, with or without pellets- The positioning of the pellets in the Kiln - The skewing of the support rollers- The positioning of the center of the support rollersWhen these parameters are varied a result for over 170 parameters can be collected. The calculation model is mainly focused on how the forces in the system reacts when the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> are adjusted and also how the Kiln reacts to thermal expansion and contraction. It is essentially the center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> which is analyzed. The calculations of the forces which occur because of the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> was too complicated and time consuming to be able to be finished during this project. The calculations regarding the skewing of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been started and future work has been recommended. The calculation model, which is one of the results of this project has been used to analyze the reactions from positioning the <b>support</b> <b>rollers.</b> By examine how great the height differences are for the Kiln, a maximum center positioning of the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> has been recommended. This recommended maximum positioning is to protect any damages to the gear contact in the drive line. The thermal effects does not have a major impact on the forces in the system. Height differences that occur during heating and cooling of the Kiln has been noted up to about 9 mm. There is no great impact on the forces in the system during the interval which the <b>support</b> <b>rollers</b> can be adjusted without exceeding the maximum height differences.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversitySuccessful {{continuous}} or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites requires {{development of}} the underpinning science, including a suitable binding system, forming defect management, and process-property relationships. A hybrid resin to stabilize the wood-strand preforms for subsequent profile forming and curing was devised using a mixture of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. This study examined the influence of PVAc on the cure kinetics of PF with differential scanning calorimetry. Results show that the cure kinetics of PF blended with PVAc does not differ significantly from neat PF resin for blend ratios of 1 or lower. The nth-order Borchardt Daniels model provided good prediction for the curing of adhesive system with a PVAc/PF ratio lower than 1 and neat PF resin. This blended resin system can potentially be used for continuous or semi-continuous profile forming of wood-strand composites. To gain an initial understanding, the complex state of deformations in wood-strand preforms during profiling forming was studied using single-curvature bending. Three failure types were identified based on the primary failure mechanisms in bending, buckling and shear slip. The initial failure in bending was predicted with a strength-based model {{with the goal of}} minimizing defects, such as buckling. A relationship between preform conditions, forming defects and thickness recovery was established. Profile-formed wood-strand composites showed much better shape conformance than profiled veneer-based composites. Slow closing rate and relatively high moisture content caused flat and peak-at-core vertical density profiles (VDP). Lower moisture content resulted in more uniform VDP. The internal stress state in the bend of the profile-formed V-specimens was determined with elastic curved beam theory. Delamination, dominated by radial stress, was the initial failure mode. The Chang-Springer failure criterion was used to determine the initiation of delamination failure within the bend of the V-specimens on <b>roller</b> <b>support.</b> V-specimens tested on pin support yielded greater bending strength than those on <b>roller</b> <b>support.</b> These support conditions provide lower and upper bounds for stresses in the bend of the specimen for some applications.
