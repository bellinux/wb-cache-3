50|$|Gears of War: The Board Game was {{released}} in 2011 by Fantasy Flight Games. Designed by Corey Konieczka, it is a cooperative game for up to four players, including the option for solo play. Each player takes control of a COG (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in red), fighting their way through randomly generated maps filled with Locust soldiers (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in light gray). These are controlled by an AI deck of cards: after each player finishes his or her turn, he or she draws a card from the AI deck and takes actions for each Locust creature. Players play cards and <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> to take actions {{as well as to}} resolve shooting and defense. The game proceeds until the player team successfully completes the mission. There are seven different missions, each featuring different objectives and enemies in randomly generated map layouts. Since its launch, the game has received one expansion, Mission Pack 1, which brought more weapons, two new missions and new enemies, including General RAAM.|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} model of cold {{pilgering}} with elastic roll dies have been developed and used to investigate the influence of <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> deformation on the material flow, contact region, roll separating force and tube dimensions. Full scale experiments were performed to validate the contact surface and tube dimensions. The {{results show that the}} influence of <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> flattening is not significant on the contact length. However, elastic deformation of <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> has strong influence on both the wall thickness reduction and roll separating force. Thus it is recommended to consider elasticity of roll dies when forces and tube dimensions are estimated. Konferensartikel i tidskrift</p...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Two players <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> with k sides, {{with each}} side equally likely of being rolled. Player one rolls m dice and player two rolls n dice. If player one’s highest roll exceeds the highest roll of player two then player one wins, {{otherwise}} player two wins. We calculate {{the probability that}} player one wins, giving a concise summation and integral version, as well as estimating the probability that player one wins for many triples (m, n, k). The answer involves numerous useful techniques (adding zero, multiplying by one, telescoping series), {{as well as some}} beautiful formulas (formulas for sums of powers, the binomial theorem, order statistics, partial summation). 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Patterning {{vast numbers}} of micro lenses on a surface {{increases}} technical importance to improve characteristics of optical parts such as liquid crystal displays. A cutting method using a diamond tool is examined to make a molding die by which array patterns of many micro lenses are molded. Realizing the cutting procedure, the developed machining system employs a cutting unit actuated by PZT and a synchronous control system of the cutting unit with a NC controller. The present paper investigates machining of micro lenses {{on the order of}} 2 kHz, using a piezo-actuated micro cutting unit. Experiments using this unit revealed {{that it is possible to}} machine a large number of micro lenses on a molding <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> for plastic film with high precision...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Micro turning {{test was}} {{performed}} on nickel plated <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> using ultra precision lathe and lenticular shape single crystal diamond (SCD) tools. For the test, fresh tools were used for each experiment to observe tool wear evolution at the cutting distances. Finite element method (FEM) simulation based on Lagrangian method was also used to calculate contact stress on the cutting surface during the machining process. For the tool wear measurement, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and 3 D Nano View, which can provide surface topography of the tools, were used. In addition, Kistler dynamometer was utilized for cutting force measurement. From the experimental result, {{it was found that}} a dominant wear mechanism was abrasion due to high contact stresses on the cutting tool surface. And it was also observed that high cutting speed caused high wear rate but slighlty reduced the cutting forces...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A novel Al- 12. 7 Si- 0. 7 Mg {{welding wire}} was {{successfully}} produced via DC casting, extrusion, <b>roll</b> <b>die</b> drawing and hole die drawing. An investigation {{was performed on}} the microstructure and mechanical properties of the welded joints using the as-produced special filler wire in different solid solution and artificial aging treatment conditions. The results showed that the as-produced Al- 12. 7 Si- 0. 7 Mg welding wire was an ideal special wire of the Al- 12. 7 Si- 0. 7 Mg wrought alloy and the homogeneous welded joints proved to be heat-treatable. Solid solution treatment and artificial aging treatment had significant influence on the microstructure, microhardness and tensile properties of the as-welded joints. A transformation of microstructures from a coarse structure to a fine structure occurred in the welded joints after the heat treatment. The microhardness and the strength of the joints increased remarkably as the solution temperature and aging time increased...|$|E
