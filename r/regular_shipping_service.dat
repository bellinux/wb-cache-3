Jasper was mined at Carreg; granite was quarried at Porth y Pistyll; and there was a brickworks at Porth Neigwl. The main source of income, however, was herring fishing. A <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>service</b> was operated to Liverpool, exporting pigs, poultry and eggs; the vessels returned laden with coal for the neighbourhood. Limestone was also imported and offloaded into the water at high tide, then collected from the beach when the tide went out. Lime was needed to reduce the acidity of the local soil, and lime kilns were built on the beaches at Porthor, Porth Orion, Porth Meudwy, Aberdaron and Y Rhiw to convert the limestone to quicklime. There was shipbuilding at Porth Neigwl, where the last ship, a sloop named the Ebenezer, was built in 1841; and at Porthor, which came to an end with the building of a schooner, the Sarah, in 1842. Aberdaron's last ship, the sloop Victory, had been built in 1792, and the last ship to come out of Porth Ysgo had been another sloop, the Grace, in 1778.|$|E

30|$|Most of {{researches}} in {{the area}} of lead time reduction assume that lead time is composed of n mutually dependent deterministic components where each component can be shortened by a crashing cost (Ben-Daya and Raouf 1994; Hayya et al. 2011; Pan et al. 2002). Usually, it is considered that lead time crash cost depends on the amount of lead time to be shortened. Lead time reduction falls in the field of selecting between <b>regular</b> and expedited <b>shipping</b> <b>services</b> which in turn is related to what transportation mode is used. Li (2013) have provided a model for designing a logistics network in which <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>services</b> with long uncertain lead time could be replaced with more expensive expedited <b>shipping</b> <b>services</b> in negligible lead time.|$|R

50|$|Still, {{from the}} Canadian perspective, there seemed {{every reason to}} persevere. Despite initial {{financial}} reverses, the Canadian-Australian Steamship Line managed to establish a <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>service.</b> Bilateral trade, though still minuscule, slowly increased as a result. Canadian exports to Australia - principally timber, canned salmon and manufactured farm implements - tripled in value between 1892 and 1900. Moreover, Canada enjoyed a tidy surplus: in 1900, it exported over $1.6 million worth of goods to Australia in exchange for imports worth only $660,000. Facilitated by regular steamship and cable connections, commerce between the two British dominions seemed certain to expand following the federation of the Australian colonies in January 1901. Canada's Liberal prime minister, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, was encouraged by Canadian exporters {{to take advantage of}} these developments and appointed a second trade commissioner to Australia in 1903.|$|E

50|$|Annobón Province {{is a small}} {{province}} of Equatorial Guinea consisting of the island of Annobón and its associated islets in the Gulf of Guinea and Atlantic Ocean's Cameroon line. The provincial capital is San Antonio de Palé {{on the north side}} of the island; the other town is Mabana, formerly known as San Pedro. The roadstead is relatively safe, and some passing vessels take advantage of it in order to obtain water and fresh provisions, of which Annobon has offered an abundant supply. However, there is no <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>service</b> to the rest of Equatorial Guinea, and ships call as infrequently as every few months. During the 2015 census, it had 5,232 inhabitants, a small population increase from the 5,008 registered by the 2001 census. The official language is Spanish but most of the inhabitants speak a creole form of Portuguese. The island's main industries are fishing and timbering.|$|E
50|$|Part of the {{approved}} {{route of}} the line was a short branch descending from the station to the north harbour {{to allow for the}} transfer of passengers and mails to packet steamers operating between Portpatrick and Donaghadee however the Admiralty who had responsibility for port works did not share the enthusiasm for development of mail services with the result that although the railway line was built there was no <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>service</b> for trains to connect with. Despite extensive correspondence between the railway company and the Admiralty the proposed development works to the harbour were not carried out although the railway company did receive financial compensation instead. Various short-lived attempts to introduce a regular service to Donaghadee but none were successful and with the failure of the Donaghadee and Portpatrick Short Sea Steam Packet Company service after only a few weeks in 1868 the railway company abandoned the line from the harbour to the station.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSignificant role in {{developing}} and shaping the city of Bratislava played Danube River. Since 1830 introduced a <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>service</b> for people and goods. The Harbour of Bratislava began to grow. At {{the turn of the}} 19 th and 20 th centuries, next to cargo harbour built a new part Winter Harbour. The harbour experienced a golden age between the world wars. In the 1 st half of the 20 th century belonged among the biggest inland river harbours in Middle Europe. The Czechoslovakia was one of the largest export countries in Europe. At that time, there were also held the International Danube Fairs. The harbour was almost destroyed during the Second World War. In the post-war period the function of the port revived and modernized. Currently consists of Passenger Harbour, Winter Harbour and innovative parts of the cargo harbour built lower downstream. From the beginning Harbour of Bratislava was built as internationally, enabling investment and implementation of activities of enterprises of different countries. According to available sources, we know that in harbour worked except to Slovakia, respectively Czechoslovakia, French, Austrian, Hungarian and German shipping company. In the past, the city with harbour was growing, presently with growing city the harbour decreases. Landing stages and the surfaces of Winter Harbour are taken for the new residential and commercial construction; the historical harbour buildings are demolished. In the past we kept pace with Europe, sometimes we even set an example. At this time is the question whether we would nowadays not take example from Europe. The paper will present a summary of the known, but especially the lesser known international contexts of Bratislava harbour. It shows a vision of which direction could move into its development, particularly with regard to its history and unique value which remained...|$|E
40|$|The Caribbean basin lies at {{the cross}} roads of major east-west and north-south liner {{shipping}} routes. A number of regional ports {{have been able to}} take advantage of their geographical position. In other ports, however, the limited scale of hinterlands and the de facto monopolistic situation of ports in Small Island States have had a detrimental effect on port development. Port infrastructure endowment varies between highly equipped global transhipment hubs and rudimentary ports with wooden quays. By the same token, the supply of <b>regular</b> <b>shipping</b> <b>services</b> ranges between highly interconnected routes on the one side, and Small Island States that are heavily dependent on a few limited feeder services on the other. At the same time, freight rates in the region dispose of a high variability. The paper analyses the impacts of port infrastructure and liner shipping connectivity on intra-Caribbean freight rates. The structure of liner <b>shipping</b> <b>services,</b> port infrastructure endowment and liner shipping freight rates are closely related to each other. The paper will analyse these relationships.

30|$|The {{predominance}} of maritime transport {{has increased in}} particular for manufactured goods due to the intensification of containerized transport services. Thanks to containerization and the global liner shipping network, small and large exporters and importers of finished and intermediate containerizable goods from far away countries can trade with each-other, even if their individual trade transaction would not economically justify chartering a ship. Thanks to a network of <b>regular</b> container <b>shipping</b> <b>services</b> with transhipment operations in so-called hub ports, basically all countries are today connected to each other. A recent empirical study confirmed the “[e]ffects of the Container Revolution on World Trade” (Bernhofen et al. 2013).

40|$|The {{strategy}} of Niigata prefecture concerning the international logistics : A design of new Land Bridge using TSR(Tans-Siberian Railway) across the Japanese Sea The new {{trend in the}} North East Asia especially in the Korean peninsula {{and the development of}} the market mechanism in Russia especially in the field of Russian automotive market are improving circumstances surrounding the international logistics in the Japan Sea. Then Niigata prefecture is facing the chance in which {{it will be able to}} promote new Land Bridge using TSR(Trans-Siberian Railway) across the Japan Sea. I will propose some issues related to new Land Bridge in this article. First issue is the revival of the <b>regular</b> container <b>ship</b> <b>service</b> between Port Niigata and Port Vostochny to promote the delivery of automotive parts from Japan to Russia which will be manufactured in Japanese automotive factories and will be assembled in Russia especially in Saint Petersburg where Japanese automotive assemblers have already advance. Second issue is the utilization of TSR to promote of the entrance of Japanese companies into the development of Siberia and Far East districts where Russian government intends to invest much money not only in the field of manufacturing but also in the field of energy and natural resources. Third issue is collaboration among Japanese districts consisting of Kyushu district. Hokkaido district and Tohoku district owing to the coordinating by Niigata district for the purpose to create the “Axis of Japan Sea” Forth issue is the creation of new cluster named 「Kan-Etu cluster」 between Niigata cluster which is typical metal-processing cluster and North kanto cluster which is typical automotive cluster for the purpose to provide Base Cargo being necessary to support container <b>ship</b> <b>service</b> between Port Niigata and Port Vostochny...|$|R
