We discuss the historical origins {{of the notion of}} <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> highlight some of the theoretical drift associated with the notion of routines over time. In particular, we note how recent routines-based work has unnecessarily moved the focus (1) from the individual to the collective level, (2) from intentional behavior to unintentional behavior, and (3) from the observable to the non-observable dimension. In parallel we also explicate the underlying theoretical problems of the concept of organizational <b>routines</b> (<b>and</b> associated constructs, such as capabilities); problems such as the lack of conceptual clarity on the origins of <b>routines,</b> <b>and</b> the more general need for microfoundations. We argue that the underlying, individual-level micro-components and interactional dynamics deserve more attention in extant work [...] calling in effect for a course-correction in work on organizational <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> capabilities.

After polishing, the diamond is reexamined for possible flaws, either remaining or induced by the process. Those flaws are concealed through various diamond enhancement techniques, such as repolishing, crack filling, or clever arrangement of the stone in the jewelry.

40|$|Adolescence and {{emerging}} adulthood are both critical transition phases wrought with developmental changes and challenges. One {{of the major}} developmental tasks that families of children, adolescents {{and emerging}} adults deal with is facilitating the development of emotion regulation. The practices that families engage in that attempt to create order and stability within the family—their <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals—may be one key family variable that helps develop better emotion regulation. Family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals tend {{to create a more}} stable environment, which in turn may predict better outcomes for individuals (Crespo, Davide, Costa 2 ̆ 6 Fletcher, 2008; Fiese, 2007; Leon 2 ̆ 6 Jacobvitz, 2003). The current study examined the extent to which <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals in the family of origin during adolescence contributed to longer term, post-adolescent positive psychological outcomes in emerging adults. The current study used a sample of 492 college students between the ages 18 - 24 years old. The college students completed a series of online questionnaires about their family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals during adolescence, their current psychological well being and emotion regulatory skills. A subset of college student had their parents participate in the study who completed similar online questionnaires about their past family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals. When emerging adults ascribed greater meaning to past family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals, this was directly related to greater psychological well being. Emerging adults and parents ascribed a different level of meaning to the family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals, which predicted greater psychological well being of emerging adults. The results of the study showed that emotion regulation was a significant mediator of the relationship between family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> relationships and emerging adults’ psychological well being. The findings of the current study support the notion that mechanisms such as family <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> rituals that families implement are related to better outcomes for individuals. When families engage in meaningful family practices during adolescence, the impact of these practices can carry over into emerging adulthood...|$|R

However, their presence quickly disrupts the normal family <b>routine,</b> <b>and</b> Marge orders Homer to evict them, leading him {{to try to get the}} three re-admitted to the school. Homer's plan involves an attempt to run down Dean Peterson with his car, but have the nerds push Peterson out of the way at the last moment, with the hope that Peterson would readmit the nerds out of gratitude for saving his life. But the plan backfires, and Homer winds up running down the dean, seriously injuring him. At the hospital, Homer admits he was fully responsible for the pranks, and asks that Benjamin, Doug, and Gary be reinstated. The dean agrees to reinstate them and does not punish Homer, agreeing to forget everything that has happened. The nerds thank Homer for his assistance and move back into their old dormitory room.|$|E
5|$|Demerits: However, competencies, {{efficiency}} and effectiveness can be unclear and contradictory, especially {{when dealing with}} oversimplified matters. In a dehumanized bureaucracy, inflexible in distributing the job-scope, with every worker having to specialize from day one without rotating tasks for fear of decreasing output, tasks are often <b>routine</b> <b>and</b> can contribute to boredom. Thus, employees can sometimes {{feel that they are}} not part of the organization's work vision and missions. Consequently, they do not have any sense of belonging in the long term. Furthermore, this type of organization tends to invite exploitation and underestimate the potential of the employees, as creativity of the workers is brushed aside in favour of strict adherence to rules, regulations and procedures.|$|E

Specifically, we explicate the behaviorist and empiricist foundations of the organizational <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> capabilities literature and the extant emphasis placed on experience, repetition, and observation as the key antecedents <b>and</b> mechanisms of <b>routines</b> <b>and</b> capabilities. Based on this discussion we highlight several, endogeneity-related concerns, namely: (1) the problem of origins and causation, (2) the problem of extremes, (3) the problem of intentionality, (4) the problem of new knowledge, and (5) {{the problem of the}} environment. We introduce the ‘poverty of stimulus’ argument and discuss how an internalist or rationalist, choice-based approach can provide a more fruitful (though preliminary) foundation for understanding organizational behavior and capabilities...|$|R

The 600-cell prison continued to be maintained for its lone prisoner from Speer and Schirach's release until Hess's death in 1987, at an estimated cost of DM 800,000. Conditions were far more pleasant in the 1980s than in the early years; Hess was allowed to move more freely around the cell block, setting his own <b>routine</b> <b>and</b> choosing his own activities, which included television, films, reading and gardening.
