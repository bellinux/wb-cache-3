40|$|Thermal {{recovery}} {{processes such as}} cyclic steam stimulation {{and steam}} assisted gravity drainage involve large volume fluid and steam injection into oil sand <b>reservoirs.</b> Thermal <b>expansion</b> and dilatation of oil sand formation causes horizontal and vertical displacements in the overburden. These deformations may not exert detrimental effects on casings and facilities if the deformation properties of the overburden are homogeneous without drastic local variation along depth. However, if there exists some natural (clay seams) or induced weak layers (swollen and softened shale layer), shear slip could develop along these discontinuities, thereby impairing the nearby casings and facilities. This paper develops a semi-empirical analytical method for estimating the relative shear slip along a weak layer in shale due to fluid and steam injection. The magnitude of slip depends on the volume and distribution of fluid and steam injection, and the extent and location of the weak layer.

Prior {{to the expansion of}} a temperate upland reservoir in Australia, we used radio telemetry to compare seasonal differences in the diel movements of adult endangered Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasica) (235 – 414 mm total length) in Cotter Reservoir, Australian Capital Territory. Macquarie perch exhibited a diel range of 389 ± 46 m, a diel mobility of 769 ± 93 m and diel area use of 24008 ± 5595 m² among four seasons. Diel range was significantly higher in winter compared with other seasons, and diel mobility was negatively correlated with fish size among four seasons. Macquarie perch inhabited deeper water in summer across the diel cycle (7. 2 ± 0. 5 m) in comparison with other seasons (spring: 3. 8 ± 0. 3 m, autumn: 3. 0 ± 0. 2 m, winter: 3. 0 ± 0. 3 m).

40|$|Urmia Lake, the world's {{second largest}} hypersaline lake, has {{decreased}} in size over recent decades primarily because inflow has diminished. This has caused serious socio-environmental consequences {{similar to those}} of the Aral Sea disaster. By using the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model, this study estimates the relative contributions of climate change and water resources development, which includes the construction of <b>reservoirs</b> and <b>expansion</b> of irrigated areas, to changes in Urmia Lake inflow over the period 1960 – 2010. The model results show that decreases in inflow generally follow observed decreases in precipitation, although the variability in inflow is more pronounced than the variability in precipitation. The results also suggest that water use for irrigation has increased pressure on the basin's water availability and has caused flows to decrease by as much as 40 % during dry years. On the other hand, the presence of reservoirs positively contributed to water availability during relatively dry years and did not significantly reduce lake inflow. By accelerating irrigation expansion in the basin, reservoirs have, however indirectly, contributed to inflow reduction. Our results show that annual inflow to Urmia Lake has dropped by 48 % over the study period. About three fifths of this change was caused by climate change and about two fifths was caused by water resource development. The results of this study show that, to prevent further desiccation of Urmia Lake, it will be necessary both to develop national plans to reduce irrigation water use and to develop international plans to address climate change. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{the results of}} the {{investigation}} of a one-shot cooling technique, called adiabatic expansion of 3 He in superfluid 4 He, are reported. The expansion cooler basically consists of an expansion cell and a 4 He reservoir connected by a superleak. In the expansion cell nearly pure 3 He is gradually diluted to a saturated mixture by the injection of superfluid 4 He from the 4 He <b>reservoir.</b> The <b>expansion</b> of the 3 He produces cooling, which, in the ideal (isentropic) case can lower the temperature by a factor 4. 56. In practice, the performance of this cooling method is limited by irreversibilities and heat leaks. In this paper several irreversible processes such as heat conduction, viscous effects, and supercritical 4 He flow, have been analyzed. Furthermore the effect of 3 He in a sinter layer in the expansion cell is discussed. The experiments have shown that the fountain pressure in the 4 He reservoir is very suitable for driving the 4 He {{in and out of the}} expansion cell. During an expansion/extraction the 4 He chemical potential difference across the superleak is zero. The realised cooling factor, defined as the ratio of the initial temperature and the final temperature, is about 3. 5 for initial temperatures between 20 mK to 190 mK. This value is lower than the ideal factor of 4. 56 that can be obtained for isentropic expansions. The discrepancy is mainly due to the relatively large heat leak. The lowest temperature obtained in this investigation was 5. 7 mK. The analyses have revealed no fundamental limitations for obtaining lower temperatures...|$|R

It {{can be found in the}} experiment that: (1) If the reservoir products water, the expansion height of two kinds of montmorillonites is similar when the water content of oil is less than 10 % or more than 20 %, the expansion height of montmorillonites is large of which expansion rate can reach to 188 % when the water content is between 10 and 20 %. (2) Through the simulation experiment of sand control, when the water content is 10 and 30 %, the screen blocking is the fastest, and the productivity index per meter is the lowest, the blockage rate is increased by nearly three times when the water content of oil is 0. (3) The influence of concentration ratio of oil and water on the productivity index per meter of metal mesh screen is larger than the swelling of montmorillonites which is mainly reflected in the water content is close to 20 – 30 %. The degree and speed of screen blocking can be reduced by reducing the water content of produced fluid.|$|R
40|$|The Macroscopic Chemistry Method is a {{technique}} for modelling chemical reactions in the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. The approach differs from conventional DSMC chemistry methods in that {{the change in the}} number of each species over a time-step is calculated from the overall macroscopic cell parameters, rather than on a collision pair basis. The Macroscopic Chemistry Method (MCM) can be applied in flows where the collision rate is highly non-equilibrium and has previously been applied to model Dissociation-recombination reactions of a symmetrical diatomic gas. Here we propose a procedure for applying MCM to a multiple species reaction set which includes exchange reactions, as well as a method by which trace species can be modelled without the need for variable weighting factors. The procedure is tested in constant volume reservoir relaxation simulations of a high temperature gas and quasi-one-dimensional expansion of a high speed, high temperature gas. Initial compositions are chosen to resemble Earth and Martian atmosphere reacting systems. For the reservoir relaxation simulations, comparisons of the species mole fractions and overall temperature predicted by MCM are made with numerical integration of the reaction rate equations. For the one-dimensional expansion, results using the trace species algorithm are compared with a simulation without the trace species algorithm but with a much larger number of simulator particles. The reaction set consists of 54 chemical reactions (40 dissociation and 14 exchange reactions) amongst 8 species. The trace species algorithm exactly reproduces the temperature history predicted by numerical integration for the reservoir simulation. Without the trace species algorithm, the errors in the mole fractions are proportional to the inverse of the number of simulator particles used. For both the <b>reservoir</b> and <b>expansion</b> flow simulations, the trace species algorithm gives an improvement in accuracy equivalent to using 100 times the number of simulator particles...|$|R
