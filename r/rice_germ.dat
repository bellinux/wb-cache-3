40|$|A Micro Z-arm mixer {{has been}} {{developed}} which needs only four grams of flour per test. The new instrument is suitable for screening new wheat cultivars in the early phase of selection {{on the basis of}} dough mixing properties. The micro-scale instrument can also be viewed as a valuable research tool for investigation of the structure/function relationships in flour and the effects of different ingredients and additives on rheological parameters. The effects of protein addition on mixing properties of wheat dough were studied. Alkali-soluble isolates and Osborne protein fractions extracted from wheat, corn-, <b>rice</b> <b>germs</b> and amaranth seeds were used as protein additives. Dough development time, maximum resistance of dough and resistance breakdown was calculated from recorded mixing curves. Results showed that the micro-scale equipment is sensitive enough for detection of the effect of less than 40 mg of protein addition on mixing parameters. The effects of additions depend on the type of proteins added to the wheat flour and the parameters calculated from the mixing curves...|$|R

40|$|Brewers’ rice, {{which is}} known locally as temukut, {{is a mixture of}} broken rice, rice bran, and <b>rice</b> <b>germ.</b> Our present study was {{designed}} to identify the effect of brewers’ rice on the attenuation of liver and kidney damage induced by azoxymethane (AOM). Alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate transaminase (AST), creatinine, and urea were evaluated to understand potential hepatoprotective effects and the ability of brewers’ rice to attenuate kidney pathology induced by AOM treatment. Liver and kidney tissues were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Overall analyses revealed that brewers’ rice improved the levels of serum markers in a manner associated with better histopathological outcomes, which indicated that brewers’ rice could enhance recovery from hepatocyte and kidney damage. Taken together, these results suggest that brewers’ rice could be used in future applications to combat liver and kidney disease...|$|E
40|$|In this study, {{in order}} to promote intake of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) {{routinely}} and continuously, we prepared several functional breads containing different percentages (0 %, 1 %, 2 % or 3 %) of GABA, designated as Taimatsu GABA (T-GABA), produced by fermented <b>rice</b> <b>germ,</b> which has been shown to have various physiological actions. The dough containing T-GABA (1 %) showed greater expansion as compared with that containing T-GABA (0 %, 2 % or 3 %). The quantity of wet-type gluten decreased in a T-GABA percentage-dependent manner. The stickiness of wet-type gluten containing T-GABA (1 %, 2 % or 3 %) was decreased as compared with that of the control bread (T-GABA; 0 %). Although the weight of the bread containing GABA (1 %, 2 % or 3 %) was not altered as compared with that of the control bread (T-GABA; 0 %) after baking, the height of the bread containing T-GABA (3 %) was the lowest. In the sensory evaluation, referees judged the bread containing T-GABA (1 %) as showing a slightly better level of taste, feeling of softness, crust, crumb and fragrance as compared with that of the control bread (T-GABA; 0 %). Together, these findings indicate that breads containing T-GABA are of functionally high quality and value, and we propose to introduce these breads into some long-term care health facilities...|$|E
40|$|The rice genus, Oryza, which {{comprises}} 23 {{species and}} 9 recognized genome types, represents an enormous gene pool for genetic improvement of rice cultivars. Clarification of phylogenetic relationships of rice genomes {{is critical for}} effective utilization of the wild <b>rice</b> <b>germ</b> plasm. By generating and comparing two nuclear gene (Adh 1 and Adh 2) trees and a chloroplast gene (matK) tree of all rice species, phylogenetic relationships among the rice genomes were inferred. Origins of the allotetraploid species, which constitute {{more than one-third of}} rice species diversity, were reconstructed based on the Adh gene phylogenies. Genome types of the maternal parents of allotetraploid species were determined based on the matK gene tree. The phylogenetic reconstruction largely supports the previous recognition of rice genomes. It further revealed that the EE genome species is most closely related to the DD genome progenitor that gave rise to the CCDD genome. Three species of the CCDD genome may have originated through a single hybridization event, and their maternal parent had the CC genome. The BBCC genome species had different origins, and their maternal parents had either a BB or CC genome. An additional genome type, HHKK, was recognized for Oryza schlechteri and Porteresia coarctata, suggesting that P. coarctata is an Oryza species.

40|$|Rice bran is a {{by-product}} of rice milling industry and constitutes around 10 % of the total weight of rough rice. It is primarily composed of aleurone, pericarp, subaleurone layer and <b>germ.</b> <b>Rice</b> bran is {{a rich source of}} vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, dietary fiber and other sterols. There is a widespread scientific agreement on various health benefits associated with consumption of dietary fiber. Consumer attitude towards health foods is promising and the scope of functional foods is growing in the world markets; rice bran is finding increased applications in food, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. However, potential applications of rice bran in food industry are limited by its instability owing to rancidity caused by exposure of oil to lipases during milling. Various methods of stabilization have been carried out, paving way for supplementation of rice bran in numerous food preparations.

30|$|Clostridium cellulovorans is an anaerobic, {{cellulolytic}} bacterium, {{capable of}} effectively degrading {{various types of}} soft biomass. Its excellent capacity for degradation results from optimization of {{the composition of the}} protein complex (cellulosome) and production of non-cellulosomal proteins according to the type of substrates. In this study, we performed a quantitative proteome analysis to determine changes in the extracellular proteins produced by C. cellulovorans for degradation of several types of natural soft biomass. C. cellulovorans was cultured in media containing bagasse, corn <b>germ,</b> <b>rice</b> straw (natural soft biomass), or cellobiose (control). Using an isobaric tag method and a liquid chromatograph equipped with a long monolithic silica capillary column/mass spectrometer, we identified 372 proteins in the culture supernatant. Of these, we focused on 77 saccharification-related proteins of both cellulosomal and non-cellulosomal origins. Statistical analysis showed that 18 of the proteins were specifically produced during degradation of types of natural soft biomass. Interestingly, the protein Clocel_ 3197 was found and commonly involved in the degradation of every natural soft biomass studied. This protein may perform functions, in addition to its known metabolic functions, that contribute to effective degradation of natural soft biomass.|$|R
40|$|Background: The high {{consumption}} {{of fat and}} sugar contributes {{to the development of}} obesity and co-morbidities, such as diabetes, and cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Different strategies have been used to prevent these diseases associated with obesity, such as changes in eating habits and/or the addition of dietary components with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, such as gamma-oryzanol (γOz) present mainly in bran layers and <b>rice</b> <b>germ.</b> Methods: Animals were randomly divided into four experimental groups and fed ad libitum for 20 weeks with control diet (C, n = 8), control diet + γOz (C + γOz, n = 8), high-sugar and high-fat diet (HSF, n = 8), and high-sugar and high-fat diet + γOz (HSF + γOz, n = 8). HSF groups also received water + sucrose (25 %). The dose of γOz was added to diets to reach 0. 5 % of final concentration (w/w). Evaluation in animals included food and caloric intake, body weight, plasma glucose, insulin, triglycerides, uric acid, HOMA-IR, glomerular filtration rate, protein/creatinine ratio, systolic blood pressure, and Doppler echocardiographic. Results: Animals that consumed the HSF diet had weight gain compared to group C, increased insulin, HOMA, glucose and triglycerides, there were also atrial and ventricular structural alterations, deterioration of systolic and diastolic function, decreased glomerular filtration rate, and proteinuria. Gamma-oryzanol is significantly protective against effects on body weight, hypertriglyceridemia, renal damage, and against structural and functional alteration of the heart.

40|$|Rice is {{a unique}} crop of great antiquity and akin to {{progress}} in human cultivation. The rice seed mainly consists of the husk, rice bran, <b>rice</b> <b>germ</b> and white rice. Rice bran is the byproduct of the rice milling process. The rice bran contains 15 - 20 wt. % oil, out of which about 95 % is extractable. Rice Bran Oil is a high-grade vegetable oil with some very unique characteristics that is excellent in both edible and non-edible ways. Rice bran oil is vastly superior to traditional cooking oils due to its flavor, stability properties, good fry-life at high temperatures and high level of natural antioxidants with nutraceutical value. It also has a significant hypocholesterolemic effect and an anti-cancer effect and {{takes care of the}} skin. Rice bran oil can be used in soap, detergent, paint, sunscreen products, hair conditioners, cosmetics, etc. as well. In this work effect of bran type on oil yield and properties has been studied for six varieties of rice available in Sri Lanka. IPA was used as the solvent in soxhlet apparatus to extract rice bran oil. Results show that the yield approximately varies from 18 % to 11 % for the types of bran tested and {{this may be due to}} the difference in degree of milling, seeding times and genetic variations of paddy. The properties tested include FFA content, Iodine value, Saponification value, Unsaponifiable Matter and specific gravity. Differences for these values for different bran type arose due to the genetic variations of paddy. Highest FFA content recorded was 1. 98 % and the lowest was 1. 25 %. Fatty Acid composition has been determined and Mass Transfer Co-efficient has been calculated for the chosen types. Oleic, Linoleic and Palmitic are the Fatty Acids which have the highest values. Mass Transfer Coefficient was 4. 264 x 10  6 ms- 1 for AT 307 variety and 4. 258 x 10  6 ms- 1 for BG 352 variety. Oil extraction and analysis of raw and parboiled bran has also been experimented and results show that bran obtained from parboiled paddy has a higher yield of rice bran oil compared to raw rice bran. FFA content is lesser in oil obtained from parboiled bran than that of raw bran. Cross flow extraction was carried out for selected bran types and the triangle diagram was prepared. In cross flow extraction, % of oil extracted reduces from the first to the last stage in any variety. Suitability of rice bran oil extracted from varieties of bran available in Sri Lanka as a raw material for food items, pharmaceuticals and bio-fuel production was further studied. LD 356 seems to be the best suited variety for biofuel production, from the varieties tested. BW 364, which gives the highest unsaponifiable matter content, has the best potential for pharmaceutical production. For food applications, LD 356 and AT 307 are the best options in terms of fatty acid compositions. BG 352 can be considered as the acceptable type for cosmetic and personal care industry...|$|E

Brown rice was germinated by {{treating}} with either normal light or Far Infrared Rays (FIR) for eighteen or twenty-one hours inside 25 ℃ incubator. The slightly germinated brown rice dealt by freeze dries. The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the change of physicochemical properties and anti-oxidative activity of germinated brown rice induced by two source of light. Germination observed in all treatments. The water content was about 40 % after germination and reduced would be to 5. 83 ~ 6. 24 % after freeze dried. Meanwhile the water activity would be lower than 0. 5. So, it could take control on the quality of rice. In addition, the increment of dry weight was about 8 % The α-amylase activities of germinated brown rice treated with FIR were higher than with normal light and increased with the germinate time. And, the α-amylase activities of germ were higher than of kernel. There was no significant difference in reducing sugar and total dietary fiber. The quantities of necessary amino acid and GABA were raise after germination. The nutritive value of total storage proteins were increase significantly. Each FIR treatment and long time would consume the quantity of vitamin E. The chelating ability of ferrous and TEAC in <b>rice</b> and <b>germ</b> after FIR treatment showed the higher level than after normal light, and increased with germinate time. The scavenging ability of DPPH free radical and superoxide radical, as well as the reducing power were showed the same tendency that the value would increase with germinate time in rice kernel, and FIR treatment had the better results than the treatment of normal light. After FIR treatment with 21 hours could obtain the better result in all antioxidant ability. 摘要 本研究以台灣良質米台中秈 10 號（TCS 10 ）為製備發芽糙米之材料。將糙米置於 25 ℃生長箱中，以一般日光燈光或遠紅外線光（FIR）照射，發芽 18 或 21 小時後，經冷凍乾燥處理，探討經不同光源照射發芽後，其米粒及部分胚芽之成分、酵素活性與抗氧化活性變化的情形。 在發芽糙米的外觀方面，以顯微鏡觀察 18 及 21 小時後發芽到 1. 61 ~ 2. 10 mm之糙米；其水分含量約在 30 ~ 32 %左右，經冷凍乾燥將水分降至 5. 83 ~ 6. 24 %，其水活性會在 0. 485 以下，可有效抑制品質變化；發芽後重量增加約 8 %。α-amylase活性隨發芽時間增加而增加，米粒中之活性經FIR照射處理者較一般光源照射處理為高，胚芽中的酵素活性更遠高於米粒。還原糖含量並無太大變化。部分必需胺基酸及GABA含量經發芽後皆有增加，總膳食纖維含量並不因發芽而下降。貯藏性蛋白質營養價值則顯著上升，而維生素E之含量，會隨發芽時間之增加而消耗。 抗氧化力分析方面，經FIR照射發芽後，米粒及胚芽中TEAC、鐵離子螯合能力皆較一般光源照射組為高，且隨著發芽時間的增加而增加。清除DPPH自由基、SOD自由基能力及還原力在米粒中呈現相同趨勢，為隨著發芽時間而逐漸提高，且以FIR照射效果優於一般光源照射組，並在FIR照射 21 小時後可得到較高之抗氧化能力。目錄 壹、前言 3 貳、文獻整理 5 一、稻米的分類與結構 5 二、糙米的分類與生理功能 9 (一) 糙米的分類： 9 (二) 糙米的生理功能： 11 1. 米糠的生理功能： 11 2. 膳食纖維及水溶性非澱粉質多醣： 12 3. 米糠醇： 13 4. 植酸： 15 5. 肌醇： 17 三、發芽米 20 1. 發芽糙米特性： 20 2. 發芽糙米所含之機能性物質： 12 四、貯藏性蛋白質 20 五、自由基與人類疾病之關係 20 1. 自由基與活性氧的定義： 26 六、遠紅外線: 29 參、實驗架構 32 肆、材料與方法 32 伍、結果與討論 42 一、基本分析 42 1. 發芽糙米之外觀照相與胚芽長度： 42 2. 發芽糙米水分含量與水活性測定： 45 3. 糙米發芽前後重量改變： 47 4. 發芽糙米αamylase活性分析： 49 5. 發芽糙米中還原糖含量： 52 6. 發芽糙米中胺基酸組成分析： 55 7. 發芽糙米中膳食纖維測定： 57 8. 發芽糙米中貯藏性蛋白質的變化測定： 59 9. 發芽糙米中維生素E含量測定： 61 二、發芽糙米中抗氧化活性測定 64 1. 螯合亞鐵離子能力： 64 2. 清除DPPH自由基能力： 67 3.

40|$|Plants are {{potential}} sources of valuable recombinant and native proteins that can be purified for pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, and food applications. Transgenic <b>rice</b> and corn <b>germ</b> were evaluated {{for the production of}} novel protein products. This dissertation addresses: 1) the extraction and purification of the recombinant protein, human lysozyme (HuLZ), from transgenic rice and 2) the processing of dry-milled corn germ for the production of high protein germ and corn protein concentrate (CPC). The factors affecting the extraction and purification of HuLZ from rice were evaluated. Ionic strength and pH was used to optimize HuLZ extraction and cation exchange purification. The selected conditions, pH 4. 5 with 50 mM NaCl, were a compromise between HuLZ extractability and binding capacity, resulting in 90 % purity. Process simulation was used to assess the HuLZ purification efficiency and showed that the processing costs were comparable to native lysozyme purification from egg-white, the current predominant lysozyme source. Higher purity HuLZ (95 %) could be achieved using pH 4. 5 extraction followed by pH 6 adsorption, but the binding capacity was unexpectedly reduced by 80 %. The rice impurity, phytic acid, was identified as the potential cause of the unacceptably low capacity. Enzymatic (phytase) treatment prior to adsorption improved purification, implicating phytic acid as the primary culprit. Two processing methods were proposed to reduce this interference: 1) pH 10 extraction followed by pH 4. 5 precipitation and pH 6 adsorption and 2) pH 4. 5 extraction and pH 6 adsorption in the presence of TRIS counter-ions. Both methods improved the binding capacity from 8. 6 mg/mL to > 25 mg/mL and maintained HuLZ purity. Processing of dry-milled corn germ to increase protein and oil content was evaluated using germ wet milling. In this novel method, dry-milled germ is soaked and wet processed to produce higher value protein products. Lab-scale and pilot-scale experiments identified soaking conditions that reduced germ starch content, enhanced protein and oil content, and maintained germ PDI (protein dispersibility index). Soaking at neutral pH and 25 degrees C maintained germ PDI and improved CPC yield from defatted germ flour. CPC with greater than 75 % protein purity was produced using protein precipitation or membrane filtration...|$|R
