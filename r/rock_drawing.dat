The reader was, perhaps, surprised by the importance I attached to the fragment of mountain background by Masaccio, given in Plate +13+ of the third volume. If he looks back to it now, his surprise will be less. It was a complete recognition {{of the laws of}} the lines of aqueous sculpture, asserted as Turner's was, in the boldest opposition to the principles of <b>rock</b> <b>drawing</b> of the time. It presents even smoother and broader masses than any which I have shown as types of hill form; but it must be remembered that Masaccio had seen only the softer contours of the Apennine limestone. I have no memorandum by me of the hill lines near Florence; but Plate +47+ shows the development of limestone structure, at a spot which has, I think, the best right to be given {{as an example of the}} Italian hills, the head of the valley of Carrara. The white scar on the hill side is the principal quarry; and the peaks above deserve observation, not so much for anything in their forms, as for the singular barrenness which was noted in the fifteenth chapter of the last volume (ยง 8) as too often occurring in the Apennines. Compare this plate with the previous one. The peak drawn in Plate +46+ rises at least 7500 feet above the sea,--yet is wooded to its top; this Carrara crag not above 5000,[97]--yet it is wholly barren.|$|E

This picture {{singularly}} illustrates {{what has}} just [...] been observed; it owes {{great part of}} its effect to the lustre of the [...] jewels in the armlet of the evil angel, and to the beautiful colors of [...] his wings. These are slight accessaries apparently, but they enhance [...] the value of all the rest, and they have evidently been enjoyed by the [...] painter. The armlet is seen by reflected light, its stones shining by [...] inward lustre; this occult fire being the only hint given of the real [...] character of the Tempter, who is otherways represented {{in the form of}} [...] a beautiful angel, though the face is sensual: we can hardly tell how [...] far it was intended to be therefore expressive of evil; for Tintoret's [...] good angels have not always the purest features; but there is a [...] peculiar subtlety in this telling of the story by so slight a [...] circumstance as the glare of the jewels in the darkness. It is curious [...] to compare this imagination with that of the mosaics in St. Mark's, in [...] which Satan is a black monster, with horns, and head, and tail, [...] complete. The whole of the picture is powerfully and carefully [...] painted, though very broadly; it is a strong effect of light, and [...] therefore, as usual, subdued in color. The painting of the stones in [...] the foreground I have always thought, and still think, the best piece [...] of <b>rock</b> <b>drawing</b> before Turner, and the most amazing instance of [...] Tintoret's perceptiveness afforded by any of his pictures.|$|E
6000|$|... {{would it}} have been without intense {{surprise}} that I heard querulous readers asking, [...] "how it was possible" [...] that I could praise Pre-Raphaelitism and Turner also. For, from the beginning of this book to this page of it, I have never praised Turner highly for any other cause than that he gave facts more delicately, more Pre-Raphaelitically, than other men. Careless readers, who dashed at the descriptions and missed the arguments, took up their own conceptions of the cause of my liking Turner, and said to themselves: [...] "Turner cannot draw, Turner is generalizing, vague, visionary; and the Pre-Raphaelites are hard and distinct. How can any one like both?"[46] But I never said that Turner could not draw. I never said that he was vague or visionary. What I said was, that nobody had ever drawn so well: that nobody was so certain, so un-visionary; that nobody had ever given so many hard and downright facts. Glance back to the first volume, and note the expressions now. [...] "He is the only painter who ever drew a mountain or a stone;[47] the only painter who can draw the stem of a tree; the only painter who has ever drawn the sky, previous artists having only drawn it typically or partially, but he absolutely and universally." [...] Note how he is praised in his <b>rock</b> <b>drawing</b> for [...] "not selecting a pretty or interesting morsel here or there, but giving the whole truth, with all the relations of its parts."[48] Observe how the great virtue of the landscape of Cima da Conegliano and the early sacred painters is said to be giving [...] "entire, exquisite, humble, realization--a strawberry-plant in the foreground with a blossom, and a berry just set, and one half ripe, and one ripe, all patiently and innocently painted from the real thing, and therefore most divine." [...] Then re-read the following paragraph (ยง 10.), carefully, and note its conclusion, that the thoroughly great men are those who have done everything thoroughly, and who have never despised anything, however small, of God's making; with the instance given of Wordsworth's daisy casting its shadow on a stone; and the following sentence, [...] "Our painters must come to this before they have done their duty." [...] And yet, when our painters did come to this, did do their duty, and did paint the daisy with its shadow (this passage having been written years before Pre-Raphaelitism was thought of), people wondered how I could possibly like what was neither more nor less than the precise fulfilment of my own most earnest exhortations and highest hopes.|$|E
