50|$|Another {{usage of}} the {{microarchitecture}} simulator is in education. Given that a course in computer architecture teaches students many different microprocessor's features and its architectures, the microarchitecture simulator is ideal for modeling and experimenting with different features and architectures {{over the course of}} a semester. For example, students may start with a microarchitecture simulator that models a simple microprocessor design at the beginning of a semester. As the semester progresses, additional features, such as instruction pipelining, register renaming, reservation stations, out-of-order execution, and scoreboarding, can be modeled and added to the simulator as they are introduced in the classroom. Microarchitecture simulator provides the flexibility of <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> with minimal costs.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} a methodology {{of creating a}} built-in diagnostic system of a System on Chip and experimental results of the system application on the AT 94 K FPSLIC with cores designed according to the IEEE 1500 standard. The system spares memory and keeps acceptable test access mechanism requirements. The diagnostic system uses a built-in processor for test control, the embedded RAM memory for storing both the compressed test vectors and the partial reconfiguration bit streams and the FPGA (Fieldprogrammable gate array) part of the chip for the wrapped cores implementation. The highly compressed test vectors are transferred from the memory to those selected cores that are reconfigured into the embedded tester cores. The patterns are decompressed within the internal scan chains of the embedded tester cores and they are simultaneously fed into the parallel scan chains of the cores under test through Test Access Mechanism (TAM) and standard wrappers. After having tested the first cores under test the TAM of the System on Chip (SoC) is partially reconfigured {{with the help of}} the partial reconfiguration bitstreams stored in the RAM memory and the till now untested cores are tested by those cores that start to serve as embedded testers. By this traveling <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> <b>testing</b> the whole circuit can be tested. For test data compression we use a test pattern compaction and compression algorithm called COMPAS. It reorders and compresses test patterns previously generated in an Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG) in such a way that they are well suited for decompression by the scan chains in the embedded tester cores. The algorithm compresses the test patterns by overlapping patterns originally generated by an ATPG. The volume of test data stored in the embedded RAM i...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Communication {{in highly}} {{interactive}} distributed applications, such as massive multiplayer online games, {{can often be}} performed efficiently using multicast, i. e., application level multicast. However, in applications with a very dynamic group management, the multicast tree will have frequent changes, and in applications that have stringent latency requirement, this operation needs to be fast. Current multicast approaches either have no notion of reconfiguration, they do not care about tree reconstruction latency or wrongly assume {{that this is a}} fast, atomic operation.

30|$|In this paper, {{simultaneous}} optimal <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> capacitor {{placement problem}} is solved in distribution networks {{to achieve the}} minimum power loss in the network. In the optimization process, the applied constraints are voltages of nodes, currents of branches, and radial condition of the network. The minimum power losses with improved voltage profile can be achieved simply. Optimal capacitor placement can control the flow of reactive power in distribution lines which in turn leads to power loss reduction, too. The proposed “improved binary PSO” algorithm has been tested on two 16 and 33 bus networks. It is concluded that simultaneous solving of these two problems will lead to better results than their separated solution. It is also shown that IBPSO leads to better results compared to other previous similar studies using other intelligent methods. Simulations and comparison results show that optimal <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> capacitor placement simultaneously result in the most optimum condition of network. According to amount of power loss reduction, the priority of optimization cases is proposed as follows {{which can be used}} by utilities to plan their networks optimally:(1) optimal network <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> capacitor placement simultaneously; (2) first, network <b>reconfiguration</b> <b>and</b> then capacitor placement; (3) first, capacitor placement <b>and</b> then network <b>reconfiguration.</b> The power distribution utilities can prioritize their network improvements optimally by using the above results.
