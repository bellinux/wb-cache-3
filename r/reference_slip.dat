40|$|The {{real-time}} {{change of}} tire-road friction coefficient {{is one of}} the important factors that influence vehicle safety performance. Besides, the vehicle wheels’ locking up has become an important issue. In order to solve these problems, this paper comes up with a novel slip control of electric vehicle (EV) based on tire-road friction coefficient estimation. First and foremost, a novel method is proposed to estimate the tire-road friction coefficient, and then the <b>reference</b> <b>slip</b> ratio is determined based on the estimation results. Finally, with the <b>reference</b> <b>slip</b> ratio, a slip control based on model predictive control (MPC) is designed to prevent the vehicle wheels from locking up. In this regard, the proposed controller guarantees the optimal braking torque on each wheel by individually controlling the slip ratio of each tire within the stable zone.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} project, brake {{performance}} of heavy vehicles is improved {{by the development}} of new wheel-based functions for a longitudinal slip control braking system using novel Fast Acting Braking Valves (FABVs). To achieve this goal, Volvo Trucks' vehicle dynamics model has been extended to incorporate the FABV system. After validating the updated model with experimental data, a slip-slope based recursive least squares friction estimation algorithm has been implemented. Using information about the tire-road friction coecient, the sliding mode slip controller has been made adaptive to dierent road surfaces by implementing a frictiondependent <b>reference</b> <b>slip</b> signal and switching gain for the sliding mode controller. This switching gain is further optimized by means of a novel on-line optimization algorithm. Simulations show that the on-line friction estimation converges close to the reference friction level within one second for hard braking.

40|$|Abstract i Anti-spin {{systems for}} cars are {{becoming}} more and more common. Today's anti-spin control systems typically use a PID controller to limit each individ-ual wheel's spin. The controller's parameters depend on dierent operating conditions and its implementation on new platforms has proven to be time-consuming and costly. The trend in the automotive industry to solve many of these problems is to use model-based control systems. In this thesis, dierent aspects of model-based anti-spin have been inves-tigated and it appeared to involve quite a few diÆcult problems. To be able to design and evaluate dierent anti-spin approaches, the car needs to be modeled. Two dierent models are constructed, one advanced simulation model for validating the complete system and one simpler model used for control purposes. The simulation model appears to work properly for all velocities of interest and while starting from rest. For the anti-spin system, the main contributions are an algorithm for estimation of tire/road friction and tire properties, a strategy for the cal-culation of a <b>reference</b> <b>slip</b> value, and design of a controller. The complete anti-spin system is tested on the simulation model and the results seem promising for possible improvements in future systems. Further validation and development of the system are needed, but perhaps the design of future anti-spin systems could be made more methodically when using the ideas presented in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this work}} a dynamic control {{allocation}} approach is presented for an automotive vehicle yaw stabilization scheme. The stabilization strategy {{consists of a}} high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tire-road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module that generates the longitudinal <b>slip</b> <b>reference</b> for the low level brake control module and commands front wheel steering angle corrections. The control allocation design is such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated form the high level module, with desirable distribution of control forces satisfying actuator constraints and minimal control effort objectives. Conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given for the case when the control allocation includes adaptation of the tire-road maximal friction coefficients, and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic non linear multi body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the yaw control allocation strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme maneuvers where the non linear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise (without active braking or active steering) becomes unstable {{in the sense of}} over- or under steering. The control allocation implementation is efficient and suitable for low cost automotive electronic control units. I...|$|R
40|$|This work {{addresses}} the control allocation {{problem for a}} nonlinear over-actuated time-varying system where parameters a¢ ne in the actuator dynamics and actuator force model may be assumed unknown. Instead of optimizing the control allocation at each time instant, a dynamic approach is considered by constructing update-laws that represent asymptotically optimal allocation search and adaptation. A previous result on uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) of the equilibrium of cascaded time-varying systems, is in the thesis shown to also hold for closed (not necessarily compact) sets composed by set-stable subsystems of a cascade. In view of this result, the optimal control allocation approach is studied by using Lyapunov analysis for cascaded set-stable systems, and uniform global/local asymptotic stability is guaranteed for the sets described by; the system dynamics, the optimizing allocation update-law and the adaptive update-law. The performance of the proposed control allocation scheme is demon- strated throughout the thesis by simulations of a scaled-model ship manoeuvred at low-speed. Furthermore, {{the application of a}} yaw stabilization scheme for an automotive vehicle is presented. The stabilization strategy consists of; a high level module that deals with the vehicle motion control objective (yaw rate reference generation and tracking), a low level module that handles the braking control for each wheel (longitudinal slip control and maximal tyre road friction parameter estimation) and an intermediate level dynamic control allocation module. The control allocation module generates longitudinal <b>slip</b> <b>reference</b> for the low level brake controller and commands front wheel steering angle corrections, such that the actual torque about the yaw axis tends to the desired torque calculated by the high level module. The conditions for uniform asymptotic stability are given and the scheme has been implemented in a realistic nonlinear multi-body vehicle simulation environment. The simulation cases show that the control strategy stabilizes the vehicle in extreme manoeuvres where the nonlinear vehicle yaw dynamics otherwise become unstable in the sense of over- or understeering.

40|$|Four Wheel Drive (4 WD) {{vehicles}} {{are almost as}} old as the automobile itself, however {{for more than half a}} century the main use case of a 4 WD system was to improve traction on off-road terrains. The advancement in technology over the recent decades resulted in more advanced and light weight solutions shifting the focus more towards sports cars and performance passenger vehicles. Furthermore, the advancements in electronic actuators paved the way for more attractive 4 WD solutions for such vehicles. The trend continues to progress as top racing formulas, such as Formula 1 and Le Mans Prototypes, have embraced 4 WD systems over the past few years and all major car manufactures recently brought road vehicles with 4 WD systems to the market. In many of these vehicles, the drivelines are electronically controllable introducing new possibilities and engineering challenges. In this thesis a control system for an Active Central Differential (ACD) will be developed in order to improve the handling and performance of a 4 WD vehicle. The central differential distributes the engine torque to the front and rear axle; the ACD is a controllable central differential for which the front to rear torque distribution can be varied electronically. Three different vehicle models are used in this work with varying complexity: single track model, two track model and multibody dynamics model. The single track model is used to study the influence of the actuator on the longitudinal and lateral dynamics in Quasi Steady State (QSS). Furthermore, this model is used for the sensitivity analysis of potentially varying vehicle parameters. The two track model forms the basis for the presented control system and vehicle state estimator. The multibody dynamics model is a close virtual representation of a real passenger vehicle and hence used for validation of the proposed control system. All models use a nonlinear tyre model (Magic Formula (MF) based), longitudinal and lateral load transfer (single track only longitudinal). The multibody dynamics model also simulates engine characteristics, drive train and differential inertia, clutch dynamics, suspension characteristics, pitch and roll dynamics, etc. These effects are neglected for obvious simplicity reasons in the single and two track models. The most relevant dynamics for the handling and stability of the vehicle lie in the vehicle yaw plane. Unlike differential braking or torque vectoring, the ACD can not directly generate a yaw moment; instead any yaw moment obtained from torque distribution changes is the result of combined slip effects (i. e. indirect actuation). Nonetheless, the torque distribution can significantly influence the performance, stability and understeer characteristics of the vehicle. To develop a better understanding of the complex dynamics involved, the system dynamics are studied by means of a QSS analysis and linearization. By studying the system at hand in QSS, key aspects (i. e. torque distribution) of the complete dynamic system can be isolated and analyzed without being affected by coupled dynamics. Furthermore, linearization of the nonlinear system is employed to study the dynamic system poles of the resulting linear parameter varying system. These system poles give insight in the stability of the system for a variety of torque distributions. A novel control system for the central differential is presented which improves the handling and performance of the vehicle for (combined) acceleration maneuvers. The control system is composed of a <b>slip</b> <b>reference</b> generator and a closed loop slip controller. Since only one control variable is available, the system controls the portion of the engine torque which is redirected to the rear axle in order to reduce the slip error of said axle in finite time. The controller type is a gain scheduled proportional integral controller with an anti integrator wind-up scheme to deal with actuator saturation. The classical problem of vehicle control systems, namely the inability to measure essential signals for the control system (i. e. tyre slip, stiffness and peak friction) is addressed with an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) based vehicle state estimator. The dynamic model of the state estimator is composed of a two track model and nonlinear normalized MF tyre model. The performance of the control system was assessed on a multibody vehicle model and the state estimator was assessed on experimental data.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Background: Decision {{aids are}} {{structures}} education packages designed to foster {{shared decision making}} between patient physician. They are often used when there is confusion or disagreement associated with the values patients assigned to, and the evidence on, the various outcomes of the intervention in question. Blood transfusion relation to elective surgery {{is an area that}} requires both physicians and patients to carefully consider different treatment options. The issues of variation in transfusion practices, different personal values in regards to receiving blood, and the uncertainty as to whether the benefits of technologies aimed at minimising allogeneic blood use (e. g. pre-operative autologous donation or PAD) outweigh the potential harms justify attempts to design a patient decision aid in this area. Aims: The overall aim of the thesis was to develop and pilot test a decision aid describing blood transfusion options to patients planning any type of major elective surgery (such as hip replacement or heart bypass). A series of studies and reviews were necessary to adequately inform the development of the decision aid. Hence, additional aims of the thesis were: to investigate whether the manner in which treatment effects are presented influence the healthcare decisions made by patients (information framing).; To systematically review the evidence on the benefits and harms of PAD (e. g. need for allogeneic/autologous blood, other clinical outcomes).; To examine the attitudes, beliefs, understanding and possible misconceptions of the general public, patients, special interest group members (e. g. Hepatitis C Council), and physicians regarding blood transfusion. Methods: The following studies were undertaken to inform the development of the decision aid: a systematic review and meta-analysis exploring the impact of information framing on patient treatment decision making; a systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled observational studies on PAD; and a survey (administered as a computer assisted telephone interview) of the views and opinions of physicians, patients, patients, and the public about blood transfusion. Decision aid development was guided by the Ottawa Decision Support Framework. The initial evaluation stages involved drafting and re-drafting the decision content by a group of experts in the fields of haematology, internal medicine, epidemiology, and health psychology. The final draft of the decision aid was reviewed by health professionals and patients who were about to have or had recently undergone major elective surgery. Participants provided feedback on its acceptability and identified areas for improvement during a semi-structures telephone interview. The decision aid was also quality assessed using the CREDIBLE criteria. Results: The results of a systematic review on information framing indicated that numerical data should be presented in {{more than one way to}} ensure patients form an accurate perception of treatment worth. In general, surgical and medical treatments tended to be preferred when information was expressed in a survival (positive) frame compared to a mortality (negative) frame, or when expressed as relative risk reduction (RRR) as opposed to absolute risk reduction (ARR) or number needed to treat (NNT) frames. The systematic review of controlled observational studies on PAD produced similar results to those from randomised controlled trials: PAD statistically significantly decreased the need for allogeneic blood yet increased the likelihood of receiving any transfusion (allogeneic/autologous) compared to usual care. Most studies (75 %) did not use a transfusion protocol and seven studies reported using a more liberal protocol for the transfusion of autologous blood compared to allogeneic blood. Due to the paucity of research examining other clinical outcomes such as infection and thrombosis, there is insufficient data to determine the impact PAD may have on these outcomes. In surveys with patients, special interest group members and the public, one-third of respondents voiced concern with receiving an allogeneic blood transfusion, and most respondents overestimated the probability of contracting HIV and HCV through a blood transfusion when compared to other events of equal risk (e. g. being struck by lightning). Approximately 80 % of respondents preferred PAD due to the perception that it eliminated all risks associated with a blood transfusion, is 100 % compatible, and that it helps others through contributing to the blood supply. Although approximately half of the physicians interviewed used a transfusion trigger or protocol, individual patient characteristics were the main factor driving the decision of whether to transfuse. However, some respondents were critical of those who either did (or did not) use protocols, while others modified the "science of the guidelines" according to the needs of the individual. The final draft of the decision aid asked patients to consider the point at which they would prefer to receive a blood transfusion after major elective surgery (using haemoglobin values or transfusion "triggers" as a guide) and to decide whether or not to use PAD. The decision aid, "Blood Transfusion Options for Planned Surgery: A Decision Aid for Patients", consisted of a 32 -page A 5 size booklet and 28 -minute audio tape or CD. The decision aid included the following sections: information about blood and blood loss; facts about blood transfusions; blood transfusions an you; your transfusion preference after surgery; approaches to replacing blood less; the differences between volunteer-donated and self-donated blood; adverse effects of blood transfusion; frequently asked questions; steps in decision making; and scientific <b>references.</b> A decision <b>slip</b> was included at the back of the booklet for patients to complete and return to their surgeon. Patients felt that the decision aid removed fears and common misconceptions associated with blood transfusion by providing them with more knowledge and realistic expectations of transfusion risks. Importantly, health professionals and patients felt that the information in the decision aid was presented in a balanced way and that it did not coerce patients to choose one particular option over another. Pilot data revealed that although the decision aid was generally well received, a number of revisions will be required before successful implementation. Important changes include; updating all information for recency; providing better explanations of numerical data; reducing the amount of information where appropriate; tailoring the decision aid for use in orthapaedic surgery (due to reduced utilisation rates of PAD); and clarifying the role of transfusion triggers in the decision aid, including whether it is appropriate to involved patients in that stage of the decision making process. The format of the decision aid also needs to be reconsidered (i. e. computer-based or continue with print and audio material) as costs and time restraints were highlighted as potential barriers to its use in practice. Based on the CREDIBLE criteria, the decision aid requires an updating policy, accessible documentation of the development process, and formal evaluation using a before-after pilot-study/randomised controlled trial. Conclusion: The task of developing and evaluating a decision aid on blood transfusion was found to be very complex and demanding. For instance, a number of in-depth studies were needed to adequately inform decision aid development and the decision aid still requires formal evaluation. However, the findings from the research undertaken in the thesis also reinforced the need for a decision aid on blood transfusion - the evidence on the benefits and harms of blood transfusion and PAD is controversial, practice variation exists, and personal values influenced patient and physician views of blood transfusion and PAD. Despite receiving positive feedback from health professionals and patients, the decision aid requires some significant modifications. Reduced utilisation rates of PAD indicate that a generic decision aid for procedures other than major orthopaedic surgery may not be relevant in practice. Although the issues surrounding blood transfusion justify the need for a decision aid, the desire for both patients and physicians for limited patient involvement regarding the decision of when to give a blood transfusion (using transfusion triggers as a guide) suggests that the aims of the decision aid in this area need to be reconsidered. However, as the number of older Australians undergoing major elective surgery rises due to population ageing, the availability of decision aids that adequately inform patients of the benefits and harms of blood transfusion and the option of PAD will be imperative. With further revision and evaluation, this decision aid should fulfill its promise as an effective tool for education patients about blood transfusion...|$|R
