5|$|Greed has {{sometimes}} been said to be over 100 reels long. Stroheim said that his initial edit was 42 reels, although several {{of the people who}} saw this cut <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> as being anywhere from 42 to 47 reels. Grant Whytock remembered the edited version that Stroheim initially sent to him as between 26 and 28 reels. MGM's official studio files list the original cut of the film at 22 reels. As recently as 1992, former MGM Story Editor Samuel Marx erroneously claimed that the original version of Greed was 70 reels.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles first {{played a}} full show with Best on 17 August 1960 at the Indra club in Hamburg, {{and the group}} slept in the Bambi Kino cinema in a small, dirty room with bunk beds, a cold and noisy former {{storeroom}} directly behind the screen. Upon first seeing the Indra, where they were booked to play, Best <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> as a depressing place filled with a few tourists, and having heavy, old, red curtains that made it seem shabby compared to the larger Kaiserkeller. As Best {{had been the only}} group member to study O-Level German at school, he could talk with the club's owner, Bruno Koschmider, and the clientele. After the Indra closed due to complaints about the noise, the group started a residency in the Kaiserkeller.|$|E

25|$|A {{decade after}} the film was released, Redford, having made peace with Laurents, {{contacted}} him to discuss the possibility of collaborating on a new project, and eventually the two settled on a sequel to The Way We Were. In it, Hubbell and his daughter, a radical like Katie, would meet but be unaware of their relationship, and complications would ensue. Both agreed {{they did not want}} Pollack {{to be part of the}} equation. Laurents sent Redford the completed script but, aside from receiving a brief note acknowledging the actor had received it and looked forward to reading it, he never heard from him again. In 1982, Pollack approached Laurents about a sequel Stark had proposed, but nothing transpired following their initial discussion. In 1996, Streisand came across the sequel Laurents had written, and decided she wanted to produce and direct it as well as co-star with Redford, but did not want to work with Stark. Laurents thought the script was not as good as he <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> being, and agreed to rewrite it once Stark agreed to sell the rights to the characters and their story to Streisand. Again, nothing happened. The following year, Stark asked Laurents if he was interested in adapting the original film for a stage musical starring Kathie Lee Gifford. Laurents declined, and any new projects related to the film have been in limbo ever since.|$|E

A few years later, after Carradine had experienced financial success with Kung Fu, he decided he wanted to make the story into a movie. He contacted Carr, who secured the rights to the Henry Morton Robinson novel, and began writing the screenplay.

500|$|When {{the series}} was {{released}} on DVD, critics <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> fondly. Video Librarian called Brisco [...] "criminally short-lived" [...] and [...] "wildly entertaining".

IGN DVD called the DVD set [...] "impressive" [...] and said that {{the series was}} [...] "a satisfying show that hits its mark". Auxiliary Magazine called Brisco [...] "one of the greatest sci-fi/Western epics in television history" [...] and compared it favorably to the more well-known sci-fi/Western shows, Firefly and The Wild Wild West. In its 2006 gift guide, the Christian Science Monitor gave Brisco a positive review, saying, [...] "Folks, there are so few comic sci-fi/Westerns, they should be celebrated, not canceled prematurely." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Hazlitt {{had seen}} As You Like It on stage, he <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> most fondly from having read it so {{frequently}} that he practically had it memorised. In Characters of Shakespear's Plays, {{he makes no}} mention at all of any stage performances, treating the play as one primarily meant to be read. What strikes him as most notable about it is its character of a [...] "pastoral drama", one that presents an [...] "ideal" [...] world—that is, a world of thought and imagination, not action. And {{though it is a}} comedy, its interest derives not so much from in our being made to laugh at any particular human follies, but rather, [...] "more out of the sentiments and characters than out of the actions or situations. It is not what is done, but what is said, that claims our attention." ...|$|E

500|$|By this time, the war {{was closing}} in on the embattled Emperor. A Union of Czech Deputies had already sworn an oath to a new Czechoslovak state {{independent}} of the Habsburg Empire on 13 April 1918, the prestige of the German Army had taken a severe blow at the Battle of Amiens, and, on 25 September 1918, her brother in law King Ferdinand I of Bulgaria broke away from his allies in the Central Powers and sued for peace independently. Zita was with Charles when he received the telegram of Bulgaria's collapse. She <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> [...] "made it even more urgent to start peace talks with the Western Powers while there was still something to talk about.

500|$|The {{historian}} of food Bee Wilson, rereading [...] "this endearing work" [...] 58 years on for The Guardian, wrote {{that she had}} <b>remembered</b> <b>it</b> as a history book and an epic account of English cooking, [...] "interspersed with recipes." [...] She was therefore [...] "startled" [...] to find that almost {{the whole of the}} text is [...] "taken up with practical recipes and techniques, with very little historical narrative." [...] Wilson finds the book as Hartley explicitly intended, an untidy kitchen, [...] "a warm friendly place". For Hartley, writes Wilson, [...] "the past is not a foreign country", but ever-present. She notes that Hartley [...] "announces dogmatically" [...] that English cooking is old-fashioned [...] "because we like it that way." [...] Wilson finds [...] "Hartley's devotion to archaic recipes such as stargazey pie and posset ... mildly crazed." [...] But whether mad or not, Hartley [...] "approaches the cuisine of the past with the humour and sharpness of a journalist." ...|$|E

500|$|Canadian poet George Elliott Clarke once {{analyzed}} section 34, {{calling it}} [...] "bland legalese." [...] He wrote it was [...] "reassuring" [...] {{because it was}} dull, signalling neither fear nor excitement. [...] Thus, it seemed to imply the Charter of Rights was not a radical constitutional change, {{despite the fact that}} it was potentially revolutionary for a constitutional monarchy. [...] In considering the name Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, Clarke felt the first word, [...] "Canadian," [...] hinted at Canadian nationalism. [...] He then compared this to the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and the United States Bill of Rights, saying that those documents were written by men who had just emerged from conflict and still <b>remembered</b> <b>it,</b> and thus Canada could be duller. [...] However, he noted there was some drama in the Charter in that it was written when there was a threat of Quebec separatism, and section 27 (multiculturalism), section 25 (Aboriginal rights), and section 15(2) (affirmative action) of the Charter could change the country.|$|E
