60|$|A right valiant and jaunty Chevalier is our hero; {{going about}} {{with his long}} Toledo perpetually drawn. Rely upon it, he will fight you to the hilt, for his bony blade has never a scabbard.

Yet, rather, are we scabbards to our souls. And the drawn soul of genius is more glittering than the drawn cimeter of Saladin. But how many let their steel sleep, till it eat up the scabbard itself, and both corrode to rust-chips. Saw you ever the hillocks of old Spanish anchors, and anchor-stocks of ancient galleons, at the bottom of Callao Bay?

Of 673 crabs surveyed, 21. 7 % had shell lesions. Of these, 82. 9 % had <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesions on the carapace. The majority of rust spot-affected crabs (78. 8 %) were female. <b>Rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesions were predominantly non-perforated (89. 4 %) and 54. 8 % were bilaterally symmetrical. There was also a gender difference {{in the areas of}} the carapace most commonly affected. The main histological features of the <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesion included: a cavity in the upper endocuticle; indentation of the endocuticle below the cavity; remains of muscle attachment adhesive epithelium within the cavity; fibrous connective tissue between the damaged carapace andthe attached muscle; and islands of endocuticle in this fibrous connective tissue.

50|$|The {{wire brush}} is {{primarily}} an abrasive implement, used for cleaning rust and removing paint. It {{is also used}} to clean surfaces and to create a better conductive area for attaching electrical connections, such as those between car battery posts and their connectors, should they accumulate a build-up of grime and dirt. When cleaning stainless steel, it is advisable to use a stainless steel bristle wire brush, as a plain carbon steel brush can contaminate the stainless steel and cause <b>rust</b> <b>spots</b> to appear. Brass bristle brushes are used on softer surfaces or in potentially flammable environments where non-sparking tools are required. Wire brushes are also used to clean the teeth of large animals, such as crocodiles and pigs. They are also used widely in surface engineering to clean the castings to paint the castings.|$|E
5000|$|Early in the {{breeding}} season, {{as many as}} 11 days may transpire between {{the completion of the}} nest and the laying of the first egg. Later in the season, this time decreases so that the first egg is laid as soon as the nest is ready. [...] The female normally lays three eggs, though clutches of up to four have been recorded. The eggs, which are variously described as pale pink with evenly distributed brown spots or white with cinnamon and <b>rust</b> <b>spots</b> densely ringing the larger end of the egg, measure 16 - 17 mm by 13 mm and weigh 1 - 1.4 g. The female alone incubates the eggs for 16 days; the male does not even approach the nest until several days after the eggs hatch. She sits facing the back wall of the nest, with her head and body sheltered by its roof and her tail sticking out the opening. She sits tight at the approach of danger, typically not flying until a potential predator actually makes contact with the nest.|$|E

50|$|Movie {{director}} Chris Wedge says New York City, Toronto and London, {{inspired him}} to make the city. There are three parts of the city: High End District: The part of the city where the rich and famous robots live. Buildings and robots are all shiny and nearly everything is futuristic. Everyone here has a metal covering that hides all their inner workings. Bigweld Industries is here. Combustion District: Low-class place. It has numerous <b>rust</b> <b>spots,</b> and robots have the internal workings similar to a 1950s car at best. Aunt Fanny's house is here, and the majority of the movie takes place here. Steam District: The lowest part of the city, and therefore the rustiest. Parts of the district resemble the inventions of the Industrial Revolution, and everywhere is filled with broken machines. Sweepers grab old robots and bring them to Madame Gasket's Chop Shop, where mutant robots then break and melt robots, turning them into upgrades. Another major location of the film is Rivet Town, home to the Copperbottom family. Two of the buildings there are Gunk's Greasy Spoon and Flathead Floyd's. Rivet Town is based on Watertown, New York, where movie director Chris Wedge lived during his teens.|$|E

Some features from Plan 9, like the UTF-8 character encoding of Unicode, have been implemented in other operating systems. Unix-like operating systems such as Linux have implemented 9P, Plan 9's file system, and have adopted features of rfork, Plan 9's process creation mechanism. Additionally, in Plan 9 from User Space, several of Plan 9's applications and tools, including the sam and acme editors, have been ported to Unix and Linux systems and have achieved some level of popularity. Several projects seek to replace the GNU operating system programs surrounding the Linux kernel with the Plan 9 operating system programs.

40|$|This is {{the first}} report {{of the results of}} the series of {{experiments}} which have been carried on by the authors from December 1978 to February 1979. This series of experiments, named Experiments 6, aimed to determine the threshold values of NaCl concentrations in concrete for steel bar rusting. A method of electrical potential difference measurements of spots of concrete specimen surfaces over Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell, having been developed by California Division of Highways and having been widely used to detect the <b>rusting</b> <b>spots</b> of steel bars in concrete, are also performed in this series of experiments. We planned to examine the method, if it can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture to detect <b>rusting</b> <b>spots.</b> The following results about steel bar corrosion are obtained by and at six months after embedding steel bars in concrete. 1. Steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 033 % of NaCl have not corroded yet without adding any amount of corrosion inhibitors. 2. Steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 067 % of NaCl do not also corrode yet, if adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors are added to the concrete. 3. In case of the concrete contained 0. 100 % of NaCl by weight, there have been steel bars corroded some, but their areas of corrosion were small. Some of the steel bars have no corrosion spots where adequate amount of corrosion inhibitors had added to the concrete. 4. All steel bars in the concrete contained 0. 133 % of NaCl by weight except A_ 4 D_ 2 C_ 2 O_ 1 specimens have been observed some corrosion. And as the time has passed, the areas of corrosion on steel bar surfaces are becoming larger. 5. There have not been any significant differences in the effects of types of corrosion inhibitors on steel bar corrosion. 6. The effects of water-cement ratio on corrosion of steel bars are not obvious. 7. The beneficial effects of doubled dosage of corrosion inhibitors into concrete are observed on steel bar corrosion. The results of electrical potential measurments on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell are as follows. 1. It has not been decided yet that the standards of California Division of Highways on steel bar corrosion in concrete can be applicable to the RC structures in Okinawa Prefecture. 2. Steel bars in concrete need not be connected by metalic means each other when half cell potential measurment method is applied. 3. <b>Rusting</b> <b>spots</b> on steel bar surfaces have high potentials, and the electrical circuit directly contained a <b>rusting</b> <b>spot</b> exhibit high potentials in the sense of absolute value. 4. Almost rusting places have occured in the underside of steel bars, and the underside of the specimen has considerable larger cover depth over steel bars than the upperside. The electrical potentials measured on the underside of a specimen were always higher than on upperside. 5. Moisture condition of the specimen concrete has strong effect on measured potential values. 6. There have been no corrosion on the steel bars in the specimens which exhibit 0. 2 volt or less of electrical potential. 7. There have been very few specimens which exhibit the electrical potential value of 0. 3 volt or higher. 8. The almost specimens having corroded steel bars at 3 or 6 months after embedding exhibit 0. 20 to 0. 30 volt higher on the basis of Cu/CuSO_ 4 half cell...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Premature {{corrosion}} {{of steel}} roof panels of a prefabricated factory building was reported {{just two months}} ’ after installation. In order {{to find out the}} causes of this corrosion, physical investigation of the affected roof was carried out and samples of the panels and relevant information were collected. Laboratory tests were carried out on the samples using light optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray micro analysis (EDX) and tensile tests. Test results show that the steel roof was constructed from painted as well as Al-Zn coated steel sheet, conforming to ASTM A 792 M Grade 340 and ASTM A 792 M-A 150. Analysis of other results suggests that the rusts were superficial in nature and they did not start from the steel sheet of the roof panels. Based on the superficial nature of the <b>rust</b> <b>spots,</b> their morphology, chemical analysis etc., it is believed that <b>rust</b> <b>spots</b> were caused by the corrosion of steel swarfs that deposited on the roof panels. The swarfs originated from drilling, cutting and riveting operations during installation. Proper cleaning of the roof immediately after installation could have avoided the problem. Importance of awareness about the danger of improper cleaning and regular maintenance of roof panels after installation is discussed...|$|E

40|$|An {{outbreak}} of a previously unrecorded shell {{disease in the}} Portunid mud crab Scylla serrata from Gladstone Harbour, Port Curtis, Queensland, was investigated. The shell lesions called 'rust spots' appeared as orange coloured areas on the dorsal carapace, which in severe cases would ulcerate to expose underlying soft tissues. Through the examination of over 3000 mud crabs the disease prevalence in Port Curtis compared {{to a number of}} other locations in Queensland, was determined. Although the prevalence varied over the three successive sampling periods, the average prevalence (14. 3 %) in Gladstone Harbour was higher than the normal background prevalence of 5 % reported for shell disease in other crustacean populations. The lesion pathology of <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesions was determined to be unique compared to the described pathology of other shell diseases, where there is an external erosion of the shell primarily due to pathogenic organisms. In non-perforated <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> lesions, however, the external shell layers remain intact, with the lesions being restricted to the endocuticle layer and adjacent muscle attachments. As this layer is fonned in the postmoult period, it is likely the lesions are due to a defect in the manufacturing of this layer rather than one of pathogenic degeneration. The histopathology was supported by observations of diseased mud crabs held over a moulting period, in which lesions were also observed to form in the postmoult phase. Although chitinoclastic bacteria are considered to be the primary causative agents of shell disease in other crustaceans, {{there was no evidence of}} an infectious or parasitic agent being associated with the internal organs or carapace lesions of the diseased mud crabs examined. Furthermore, water and inoculation transmission experiments failed to reproduce the disease in juvenile mud crabs, sand crabs (Portunus pelagicus) or prawns (Penaeus japonicus). Although the nature of transmission experiments is that failure to reproduce the disease does not necessarily mean definitively a noninfectious cause, in combination with the pathology results they suggest that the cause of <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> shell lesions is likely to be non-infectious. Haemolympl 1. assays were undertaken in an endeavour to measure the health status of diseased mud crabs. Results indicated elevated biochemical factors (two immune factors; antibacterial and phenoloxidase and one cellular enzyme; glutamate dehydrogenase) in both diseased and non-diseased crabs from Gladstone compared to the crabs from Ayr, a non-impacted site where no shell disease had been recorded. Levels in the diseased group of crabs were, however, depressed in comparison to their non-diseased cohorts from the same location, indicating a possible suppression of immune responses in diseased crabs. As shell disease had been associated with polluted environments, the metal analyses of diseased and non-diseased mud crab tissues from Gladstone were also compared with those from Ayr. Copper and zinc were elevated in mud crab hepatopancreas from Gladstone compared to Ayr in two consecutive years. Mean copper concentrations of Gladstone crabs were two to three times greater than for mud crabs sampled from other locations in Queensland. Total metal burdens were also elevated in the Gladstone mud crabs, with a high variation in the diseased mud crabs suggesting that this group may be unable to regulate metal levels. As copper and other metals have been demonstrated to cause inhibition of calcium uptake in other crustaceans, copper exposure experiments were conducted to test the hypothesis that copper could cause <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> shell lesions by inhibiting calcium uptake in the developing postmoult cuticle. The experiment confirmed that calcium uptake into the carapace of softshelled juvenile, mud crabs was inhibited by sublethal copper exposure. The copper exposure experiments supported the pathology findings that <b>rust</b> <b>spot</b> shell lesions are likely to be caused by a defect in the manufacturing process of the endocuticle. The source of elevated copper accumulations in mud crabs, whether water or sediment borne or dietary was investigated. Water and sediments collected from mud crab burrows and analysed for metals determined that very low concentrations of metals exist in the burrows. A comparison was made between the diets of Gladstone mud crabs and those from Ayr to determine whether diet could be implicated as a source of elevated copper in the Gladstone mud crabs. Stable isotope analyses (carbon and nitrogen) of mud crab muscle was undertaken as an alternative to gut content analysis to determine the dietary sources of carbon and trophic position of crabs from the two areas. Although Gladstone and Ayr crabs had a similar trophic position the disparate delta carbon results suggests the diets of the crabs are different with a correlation established between delta carbon and copper concentration in the tissues. It is possible that diet may be a source of copper in Gladstone mud crabs through biomagnification along the food chain. Although results are preliminary, research into this poorly defined area of ecosystem health in Port Curtis should be continued...|$|R

40|$|Cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium yamadai Miyabe) is a {{fungal disease}} that causes {{substantial}} injury to apple trees {{and results in}} fruit with reduced size and quality and a lower commercial value. The molecular mechanisms underlying the primary and secondary metabolic effects of <b>rust</b> <b>spots</b> on the leaves of Malus apple cultivars are poorly understood. Using HPLC, {{we found that the}} contents of flavonoid compounds, especially anthocyanin and catechin, were significantly increased in rust-infected symptomatic tissue (RIT). The expression levels of structural genes and MYB transcription factors related to flavonoid biosynthesis were one- to seven-fold higher in the RIT. Among these genes, CHS, DFR, ANS, FLS and MYB 10 showed more than a 10 -fold increase, suggesting that these genes were expressed at significantly higher levels in the RIT. Hormone concentration assays showed that the levels of abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene (ETH), jasmonate (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) were higher in the RIT and were consistent with the expression levels of McNCED, McACS, McLOX and McNPR 1, respectively.

The condition of 9975 - 01818 was also evidenced by several <b>rust</b> <b>spots</b> along the bottom chime of the drum, although no significant rust was noted on the closure bolts. Packages 9975 - 01903 and 9975 - 02287 were also examined. The axial air gap in these two packages was less than in 9975 - 01818, but still exceeded 1 inch.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the Intelligent Mobile Sensor System (IMSS) project is to develop an operational system for monitoring and inspection activities for waste storage facility operations at several DOE sites. Specifically, the product of this effort is a robotic device with enhanced intelligence and maneuverability capable of conducting routine inspection of stored waste drums. The device is capable of operating in the narrow free aisle space between rows of stacked drums. The system has an integrated sensor suite for problem-drum detection, and is linked to a site database both for inspection planning and for data correlation, updating, and report generation. The system is capable of departing on an assigned mission, collecting required data, recording which portions of its mission had to be aborted or modified due to environmental constraints, and reporting back when the mission is complete. Successful identification of more than 96 % of drum defects has been demonstrated in a high fidelity waste storage facility mockup. Identified anomalies included <b>rust</b> <b>spots,</b> rust streaks, areas of corrosion, dents, and tilted drums. All drums were positively identified and correlated with the site database.
