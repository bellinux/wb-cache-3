Some licensees continued to make small numbers of speakers, for a while, using re-manufactured parts. However, Stirling Broadcast, one of the last batch of licensees, completely redesigned the product based on the audio signature of the original, and launched the LS3/5A v2 with the full endorsement of the broadcaster in early 2006.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{familiar}} form of cellular signaling is synaptic transmission, whereby a nerve impulse that has <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> one neuron is conveyed to an adjacent neuron via the release of neurotransmitters. This transmission is {{made possible by the}} action of synaptic vesicles loaded with the neurotransmitters to be released. These vesicles fuse with the cell membrane at the pre-synaptic terminal and release its contents to the exterior of the cell. The contents then diffuse across the synapse to the post-synaptic terminal.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the changes}} to the design and its growing costs, {{construction}} of three DDLs {{was approved by the}} Liberal Party McMahon Government in August 1972. At this time, the total project cost was estimated at A$355 million; this figure included all costs associated with building three ships and operating them for ten years. The ships themselves were expected to cost approximately $210 million. All three ships were to be built at Williamstown Dockyard, with construction of the first ship beginning in 1975, followed by the other ships at two-yearly intervals. The initial DDL was to be commissioned in 1980, and the third in 1984. Further DDLs may also have been ordered over time to replace the Navy's destroyers as they <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their service lives.|$|E
5|$|On 5 February 2015, Network Rail's tracklaying machine <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> {{the line}} at Tweedbank station where a large crowd had gathered. As {{there was not enough}} track for the train to {{complete}} tracklaying into the second platform, it had to return the next day. The formal completion took place on 12 February when Keith Brown clipped the final length of rail into place. During the period of construction, more than 1,000 rails were laid across 90,000 sleepers. With the infrastructure complete, attention was turned to the installation of signalling and communications equipment as well as finalising the stations. A GSM-R system controlled from the IECC next to Edinburgh Waverley was in place by April 2015.|$|E
5|$|Oslo Sporveier {{was highly}} {{satisfied}} with the SL79 articulated trams that had been delivered during the 1980s.

The new stock was considered to be a limited trial. If it met performance expectations, future orders could be made to replace the T1000 stock when the latter <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> its economical life in around 2000.

5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide. Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead {{some of the members}} on the Meek Cutoff. The remaining parts of the wagon train <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E
5|$|Mendes {{made his}} debut in a 1–0 defeat at Crystal Palace on 20 August 2005. He made two more appearances, {{including}} one in a 2–1 League Cup win against Peterborough United, before losing {{his place in the}} squad when Bobby Williamson was replaced by Tony Pulis as manager. He had a trial with Major League Soccer club New York Metrostars in January 2006 before his contract with Plymouth Argyle was cancelled by mutual consent. In June 2006, he returned to France where he signed a two-year contract with Créteil of Ligue 2. He made his debut on 28 July 2006 in a 0–0 draw with Guingamp. Mendes made six more appearances for the club, before being released from his contract in December 2006. A month later, he returned to Portugal where he signed a short-term contract with Liga de Honra club Penafiel. He made his debut in a 1–0 defeat at Rio Ave on 4 February 2007, and made 5 more appearances during the 2006–07 season as Penafiel finished 8th in the table. Having <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his contract with the club, Mendes returned to Aves ahead of the new season.|$|E

5|$|No.80 Wing {{completed}} its move to Morotai in March. No.457 Squadron's Spitfires left Darwin on 6 February and {{arrived on the}} island two days later. Later that month No.79 Squadron joined the wing at Morotai. This squadron had previously operated Spitfires in New Guinea and nearby islands before withdrawing to Darwin in January 1945 to receive MarkVIII Spitfires. The final ship carrying No.80 Wing personnel and equipment from Darwin arrived at Morotai in early March. Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes, who had been appointed No.80 Wing's wing leader in October 1944, assumed temporary command of the unit for several days in late March while Caldwell made a trip to Manila. On 31March Wing Commander Glen Cooper assumed command from Caldwell, who had <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> his appointment and was disillusioned with how No.80 Wing had been used.|$|E
5|$|Pearson began 1979 {{by winning}} the pole {{position}} at year's first race at Riverside; he finished in second place. 1979 was Pearson's final season racing for the Wood Brothers, with his last race happening at Darlington. After a miscommunication, he left the pits without waiting for the pit crew to place lug nuts on {{the car and the}} tires fell off the car when he <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> pit lane. Pearson quit the team after the race. Pearson had won 43 races between 1972 and 79 while driving for the Wood Brothers. Later during the season, Rod Osterlund's rookie driver, Dale Earnhardt, suffered a shoulder injury. Osterlund hired Pearson to replace Earnhardt during four races; he collected the pole position at Michigan and won the 1979 Southern 500. For the season, Pearson had competed in nine races and finished 32nd in points. Fans voted him as NASCAR's Most Popular Driver.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Willie and Martin {{companies}} were {{running out of}} food and encountering bitterly cold temperatures. On October 19 a blizzard struck the region, halting the two companies and the relief party. The Willie Company was along the Sweetwater River approaching the Continental Divide. A scouting party sent ahead by the main rescue party found and greeted the emigrants, gave them {{a small amount of}} flour, encouraged them that rescue was near, and then rushed onward to try to locate the Martin Company. The members of the Willie Company had just <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their flour supplies. They began slaughtering the handful of broken-down cattle that still remained while their death toll mounted. On October 20 Captain Willie and Joseph Elder went ahead by mule through the snow to locate the supply train and inform them of the company's desperate situation. They arrived at the rescue party's campsite near South Pass that evening, and by the next evening the rescue party reached the Willie Company and provided them with food and assistance. Half of the rescue party remained to assist the Willie Company while the other half pressed forward to assist the Martin Company. The difficulties of the Willie Company were not yet over. On October 23, the second day after the main rescue party had arrived, the Willie Company faced the most difficult section of the trail—the ascent up Rocky Ridge. The climb took place during a howling snowstorm through knee-deep snow. That night 13 emigrants died.|$|E
