5000|$|Although {{there has}} been a fishing cove at Mullion for several hundred years a small seine fishery began in the early 1700s with fish being {{processed}} at Newlyn. In 1793 the Seine Fishery here began to expand in association with Fish Cellars and Merchant businesses at Newlyn and Penzance. A change was seen in the Cove with the construction of a number of large Fish Cellars for processing the fish catch. In 1809 local newspapers carried an advertisement [...] "... auction sale of the Mullion Pilchard and Herring Fishery, carried on at Mullion and Newlyn, including a New- Built Cellar capable of curing over twelve hundred hogsheads of fish enclosing an excellent salt cellar, commodious Lofts and a pump well supplied with water. Also included in the auction are 5 Stop seines, 2 Tuck Seines, with Boats, tackle and materials". The entrance to the Cove was also widened to incorporate more boats with the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks.</b> By the 1840s the two Grist Mills {{on the north side of}} the Cove were becoming less efficient and ceased to operate around 1846-1847 following the Sale of Mullion Mill Farm, and 3 Grist Mills occupied by John Williams. These were reported to be in good working order at the time of the Sale. This left only the one Mill in operation at Criggan (also spelt Criggian or Creggian). By 1848 there were two cottages built for residence by local Coastguard officers and their families. These now form Cove Cottage. A description of the Cove was recorded as follows, [...] " [...] Mullion Cove contains a Mill worked by a stream running down through the valley, some fish cellars and a few humble cottages, on which last, owing to the height of the rising ground behind them, the sun, in the winter months, never shines. In one of these lives an old man who has been blind for many years who ... is glad indeed when the month of March is come, for he finds his solitary walk up and down the road in front of his cottage more cheerful when he feels the blessed sunshine falling on his sightless eyes". At this time there was one Fishing family recorded as living in the cove.In 1867 the stream leading into the Cove was diverted under the roadway into the course of the old Leat to in order to build the Lifeboat House. In 1868 came the first significant move to build a harbour in Mullion Cove. The strong sea currents around the Lizard, combined with adverse weather, sometimes prevented ships which had often sailed halfway around the world from completing their journey around the Lizard into the English Channel. Many of the sailing ships, for years, took a course which led them towards Falmouth to obtain new Orders for delivery of their cargo, to repair damage and to restock. Some took the wrong course in bad weather, storm or fog.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{complexity}} in temperate intertidal rockpools was manipulated to assess {{its effect on}} fish assemblage structure. We modified {{the complexity of the}} substratum within pools by adding or removing loose rocks. The complexity of the water column within pools was modified by the removal of macro-algae and the addition of artificial algae. We applied 5 treatments to 40 pools in 2 locations on the southeast Australian coast: addition of rocks and algae (+R+A), <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> and algae (–R–A), <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> but addition of algae (–R+A), addition of rocks and removal of algae (+R–A), and unmanipulated control pools (C). Changes in algal cover alone had no significant effect on fish assemblages. The total number of individual fishes, species richness, species composition and abundance of the 4 most abundant species only differed in the –R–A treatment. There was no change in the length-frequency distributions of the most abundant species after habitat manipulations. The effects of manipulating substratum habitat complexity were investigated further by reversing the treatments in the same pools, i. e. by adding rocks to pools where rock had previously been removed and vice versa. This resulted in a significant increase in species richness and the numbers of individuals in rockpools where substratum heterogeneity had been increased, relative to pools in which it had been decreased. This study revealed that rockpool fishes do not discriminate between the structural complexity within these 2 microhabitats (substratum and water column) so long as some shelter is available. However, substratum complexity may represent the most attractive shelter, since most species are benthic or at least demersal. We speculated that the lack of habitat specificity exhibited by fishes in this study may be due to many rockpool fishes only using rockpools as temporary refugia at low tide...|$|E

40|$|Design of rock slope {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{challenges}} at every stage of open pit mining operations. Providing an optimal excavation design based on a robust analysis in terms of safety, ore recovery and profit is the ultimate goal of any slope design. The rock slope stability is predominantly controlled by the strength and deformation of the rock mass which characteristically consists of intact rock materials and discontinuities. Initially, movement of the slope occurs due to stress relaxation as a result of <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> which used to provide confinement. This behavior of slope can be attributed to linear elastic deformation. In addition to this, sliding along discontinuity surfaces and dilation in consequence of formation of cracks can occur. Ultimately all these instabilities lead to failure of the slopes. Therefore, formulation of slope designs plays critical role in the process of slope stability. In conventional approaches for assessing the stability of a homogeneous slope, such as the limit equilibrium method (LEM) and shear strength reduction (SSR) method, rock mass strength is usually expressed by the linear Mohr-Coulomb (MC) criterion. However, rock mass strength is a non-linear stress function. Therefore, the linear MC criterion generally do not agree with the rock mass failure envelope, especially for slope stability problems where the rock mass is in a state of low confining stresses that make the nonlinearity more dominant. With the aim of better understanding the fundamental rock slope failure mechanisms and improving the accuracy of the rock slope stability results, this research focuses on the application of the Hoek-Brown (HB) criterion, which can ideally represent the non-linear behavior of a rock mass, on the rock slope stability analysis. There, three major sections are available in the thesis. The first section, from Chapters 1 to 4, proposes new methods for estimating the intact rock and rock mass properties, which will be used for slope stability analysis. In the second section studied in Chapter 5, a new non-linear shear strength reduction technique is proposed for the analysis of three-dimensional (3 D) slope modeling. In section three (Chapter 6), novel stability charts are proposed, which have the merit of estimating factor of safety (FOS) for a given slope directly from the HB parameters and rock mass properties. These charts can provide a quick and reliable assessment of rock slope stability. The major research contributions and outcomes of the overall researches are presented in six journal publications which are forming the thesis. The titles of Chapters 1 through 6 reflect the titles of the journal papers. In Chapter 1, laboratory tests conducted on Hawkesbury sandstone obtained from New South Wales are carried out to investigate the relationship between the HB constant mi and uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of intact rock. Based on the analysis of the laboratory tests and the existing database, a new method that can estimate the HB constant mi values from UCS and rock types is proposed. The proposed method can reliably be used in the HB criterion for intact rock strength estimation when the triaxial tests are not available. In Chapter 2, an analytical solution for estimating the instantaneous MC shear strength from the HB failure criterion for highly fractured rock mass is presented. The proposed solution is based on the assumption that the HB parameter, s is equal to zero. The proposed solution has the merit of producing very accurate shear strength for highly fractured rock mass where the Geological Strength Index (GSI) is less than 40. In Chapter 3, an analytical solution, which can calculate the shear strength of rock masses accurately for the whole range GSI values, is proposed as an extension to the work in Chapter 2. The proposed approach is based on a symbolic regression analysis performed by genetic programming (GP). The proposed solution not only can be implemented into the LEM to calculate the instantaneous shear strength of each slice of a failure surface under a specified normal stress, but also can be implemented into finite element method performed by SSR approach to calculate the instantaneous shear strength of each element under different stress state of a slope. In Chapter 4, as a part of estimating rock mass strength and elastic properties in the first section, the most widely used empirical equations for the estimation of deformation modulus of rock masses (Em) are reviewed. Two simplified empirical equations for estimating of Em are also presented. The proposed empirical equations use the Rock Mass Rating classification system and the deformation modulus of intact rock (Ei) as input parameters. These equations can be used in the numerical modelling for slope stability analysis, which is conducted in Chapter 5. In Chapter 5, a new non-linear shear strength reduction technique is proposed to analysis the stability of 3 D rock slopes satisfying the HB failure criterion. The method for estimating the instantaneous MC shear strength from the HB criterion described in Chapters 2 and 3 are used to estimate shear strength of elements in FLAC 3 D model. The proposed 3 D slope model is used to analyse the influence of boundary condition on the calculation of FOS using 21 real open pit cases where the values of mi and Em values are calculated from the methods introduced in Chapters 1 and 4, respectively. Results show that the values of FOS for a given slope will be significantly influenced by the boundary condition, especially the case where the slope angle is less than 50 °. In Chapter 6, extensive slope stability analyses using LEM are carried out. The calculation of FOS is based on estimating the instantaneous MC shear strength of slices of a slip surface from the HB criterion. Based on the analysis results, novel stability charts are proposed. The proposed charts are able to estimate the FOS for a given slope directly from the HB parameters, slope geometry and rock mass properties. It is suggested that the proposed chats can be used as useful tools for the preliminary rock slope stability assessment. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{conservation}} of the world’s biodiversity {{is a challenge}} of paramount importance as the world changes rapidly and global land use intensifies. Today, nearly 20 % of reptile species across the globe are threatened with extinction yet knowledge of diversity in this group remains poor. The problem is most critical in the world’s expanding agricultural environments where there have been extensive declines and localised extinctions of reptiles. The Monaro region of south eastern NSW in Australia is a prominent agricultural region where livestock grazing has occurred for some 180 years, largely replacing natural grassland modification processes that included wildfire, kangaroo grazing and burning by indigenous people. Much of the vertebrate fauna that once occupied this region (e. g. emus, bandicoots, rat kangaroos, wallabies and bustards) has disappeared since European settlement. Yet reptiles remain a significant component of the vertebrate fauna in this region. The grassland earless dragon Tympanocryptis pinguicolla is one such species. This cryptic lizard is one of Australia’s rarest and most endangered reptiles having declined and contracted in range dramatically. The rediscovery of this species in the Monaro region in 1993 was followed by limited surveys that suggested a relatively broad but undefined distribution within the region. Despite this, little was known about the species habitat preferences, making difficult informed decisions about its conservation management. This was concerning given the region is subject to agricultural intensification, changes to vegetation clearing laws, increasing renewable energy developments such as wind turbines and the potential sale of Travelling Stock Reserves. In this thesis, I report on three key aspects of the ecology of T. pinguicolla: (1) the effectiveness of detection techniques, (2) the extent of its distribution and habitat requirements, and (3) how land management practices in the region may affect the lizard. To address these aims, I employed a targeted, landscape wide, probabilistic sampling program which accounted for T. pinguicolla rarity through statistical inference. Specifically, I conducted repeated presence/absence winter rock turning surveys at 67 sites over four years and used a robust binomial mixture model in WINBUGS and logistic regression modelling using R to estimate occupancy and detectability and the landscape and microhabitat variables that drive its presence. I determined that T. pinguicolla has a very low detectability (0. 0098) and an occupancy estimate of 0. 46 suggesting the species was {{likely to have been}} missed at some sites during survey. It is therefore likely that the lizards are more widespread across the Monaro region than previously thought. I also found that the lizard’s occupancy is likely to be greatest at higher elevations in native grasslands not dominated by Themeda triandra on private lands, on both basalt and sedimentary geology between the Murrumbidgee and MacLauchlan river systems. Occupancy was not influenced by Travelling Stock Reserves or Nature Reserve indicating private grazing lands make up most of the species area of occupancy. By considering survey effort and the level of confidence in the estimate of detectability I assessed detection at 60 sites. This analysis revealed that about 2400 rocks need to be turned at an occupied site to have a 90 % chance of detecting T. pinguicolla. The number of rocks increased to 5400 to raise confidence to 99 %. My survey effort was sufficient to infer absence with high confidence at some sites highlighting serious concern for the species at numerous sites around Cooma in particular the Kuma Nature Reserve; the only grassland reserve for this lizard in the Monaro region. Overall, my analysis confirms the low effectiveness and likely destructive nature of rock turning as a survey technique for this lizard and other threatened rupicoline reptiles, suggesting the need for alternative survey approaches. I also compared remote activated cameras at one site in the Monaro region with rock turning. The cameras provided clear and easily identifiable photos and video recordings of the lizard while rock turning failed to detect the species. This preliminary trial indicates that camera traps are likely to offer an effective less invasive and less labour intensive alternative approach to the detection and monitoring of T. pinguicolla. Despite the species extremely low level of detection, my surveys resulted in the discovery of new locations for T. pinguicolla on private properties and Travelling Stock Reserves, extending our understanding of the species range and habitats. Analysis of habitat data collected at sites using logistic regression modelling confirmed that Lycosid spider burrows associated with partially embedded surface rocks of any size are of critical importance to T. pinguicolla. This is because these burrows provide shelter sites for overwintering, refuge from trampling by livestock and predation and as locations where eggs can be laid. T. pinguicolla showed a clear preference for overwintering sites where there were no other burrows in the immediate vicinity. Surprisingly, the number of medium or large rocks showed no relationship with the occurrence of the lizards. Individuals were found overwintering beneath rocks of different sizes including small rocks and large boulders. The analysis revealed that high densities of small rocks in moderate height grasslands (200 - 300 mm average tussock height), particularly those dominated by Poa sieberiana and Austrostipa spp were good predictor’s of T. pinguicolla habitat. Where this habitat occurred in close proximity to landscape and habitat structural changes such as rock outcrops this improved the likelihood of it being habitat for the lizard. Modelling for both occupancy and paddock scale habitat preferences revealed a negative influence of Themeda triandra dominated grasslands on T. pinguicolla occupancy. I identified that occupancy is improved in T. triandra dominated sites with abundant small rocks that have a moderate to high density of mature tussocks and which are in close proximity to landscape and habitat structural features such as rock outcrops. I discovered that landform and aspect were not good predictors of T. pinguicolla habitat with surveys confirming T. pinguicolla inhabited the full spectrum of landforms and aspects available in the Monaro region including native grasslands with a dominant exotic herbaceous understory. These habitat findings are most important given the current protection criteria of natural grasslands and proposed changes to vegetation clearing laws in the Monaro region. This research has provided the first ever comprehensive review and investigation into the ecology and {{conservation of}} T. pinguicolla in the Monaro region of NSW providing a baseline for future research and conservation action. It provides an improved understanding of this species’ ecology and conservation needs and addressed several priority recovery actions identified in the National Recovery Plan for the species. A key message from this research is that managed grazing regimes in natural temperate grasslands are likely to be compatible with the conservation of T. pinguicolla in the Monaro region. Such managed grazing practices that exclude overgrazing are best placed to mimic pre European settlement modification processes. By contrast the overwintering and microhabitat preferences of this lizard indicate pasture improvement through ploughing, application of fertiliser and <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rocks</b> are not compatible with the conservation of this species. Additional efforts in conservation are required for this nationally critically endangered lizard and must involve further surveys across the region, prompt investigation into suspected declines in parts of its range and exploration into spatial and temporal land use and its role in driving occupancy. This will require improved collaboration and relationships with private landholders in the Monaro region and an adaptive plan that has the objective of monitoring, protecting and managing lizard populations on private land...|$|E

5000|$|As {{a method}} of combating this alleged problem, the PMRC {{suggested}} a voluntary move by the RIAA and the music industry to develop [...] "guidelines and/or a rating system" [...] similar to the MPAA film rating system. Additional suggestions from the PMRC that appeared {{in an article in}} the Washington Post included: printing warnings and lyrics on album covers, forcing record stores to put albums with explicit covers under the counters, pressuring television stations not to broadcast explicit songs or videos, [...] "reassessing" [...] the contracts of musicians who performed violently or sexually in concert, and creating a panel to set industry standards. This article led to the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> music and magazines from American stores including Wal-Mart, J. C. Penney, Sears and Fred Meyer.|$|R

40|$|Information (RAI) 02. 05. 01 - 047 {{regarding}} {{geological mapping}} of the Lee Nuclear Station (Lee) site. As {{described in this}} response, geologic mapping <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> surfaces was conducted as part of construction activities for the former Cherokee Nuclear Station (Cherokee). Extensive mapping <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> surfaces exposed during Cherokee Units 1 through 3 construction activities was performed at two levels. The first level of geologic mapping consisted of geologic mapping of the top-of-rock surface (after stripping of overburden and before blasting). Top <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> geologic mapping was conducted for Cherokee Units 1 through 3 (1 : 240 scale). The second level of geologic mapping was performed after completion <b>of</b> blasting, <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> debris, and cleaning of the exposed foundation-level rock surface. This final excavation (top-of-foundation) mapping was conducted for all of Cherokee Unit 1, and {{for a portion of}} Cherokee Unit 2 (1 : 120 scale). For convenience, Figures 1 and 2 from the Duke Energy response to RAI 02. 05. 01 - 047 are included as Enclosure 1, and illustrate the areas mapped. Following detailed mapping, the Cherokee Unit 1 foundation-level rock was subsequently covered with fill concrete, and then by structural concrete slabs and walls...|$|R

In addition, the proposed deshaling system offers direct cost reductions to power plants, since the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> at mine face reduces grinding demands, improves boiler efficiency, increases carbon burn-out, reduces slagging/fouling problems, decreases erosion rates and lowers bottom ash/fly ash loads. More importantly, the calculated improvement in profitability resulting from the enhanced fuel quality provides an important financial incentive for Indian companies to implement this clean coal technology for other important purposes such as environmental control. Other control measures for reducing downstream emissions of CO 2, particulates and air toxics do not offer a similar financial return and require substantial capital investments that {{may be difficult to}} adopt given India’s rapidly growing demands for energy infrastructure and other public services.|$|R
50|$|Construction {{started on}} 1 April 1891. Site offices were {{established}} in Waldheim and Rochlitz, their first tasks were surveying work, purchase of land, provision of materials, and hiring of workers. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 27 October 1891 {{on the site of}} the bridge across Zwickauer Mulde, the largest engineering structure on the line. Substantial work, however, started only in June 1892. Part of Hausberg hill in Döhlen needed to be removed to make room for railway and road. The rock masses were used to raise the ground on the site of Döhlen station. Work in Geringswalde (where 96,000 m3 of earth had to be moved to level the ground for the station) and Hartha started in August 1892, and in Waldheim in November 1892. There,the expansion of the station in 1888, together with the <b>removal</b> <b>of</b> <b>rock</b> on its north-western edge, had created favourable conditions for further construction work.|$|R
