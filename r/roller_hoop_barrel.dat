50|$|Most of the ship's wooden hull was lost, but {{the layout}} of the ship could be seen from the {{placement}} of the anchors, guns and fasteners.Corrosion and chemical interactions had melded many of the metal artifacts into conglomerates.One of these weighed more than two tons and was more than 4 m in length.It held two anchors, a <b>hooped</b> <b>barrel</b> gun of wrought-iron, and various other objects.The divers made careful maps of the material they recovered, but had no way of determining on the spot what was inside the metal conglomerates encrusted by marine growth.The divers recovered some of the conglomerates and some individual artifacts in 1972.The next year they recovered the rest of the large conglomerates, many smaller conglomerates and individual artifacts. In all they brought up 12000 kg of artifacts in 1972-73.The Texas Archaeological Research Laboratory received all the artifacts for analysis.|$|R

50|$|This {{was beyond}} doubt the most {{brilliant}} pageant ever witnessed in the city. Not only was every civic association and benevolent society represented in the vast procession, but the German citizens of the north west had selected St. Joseph as the place for holding their annual Sangerfest on the same day. The procession which traversed the streets of St. Joseph, was never equaled west of the Mississippi. Every trade was represented. The cooper was <b>hooping</b> <b>barrels</b> in his improvised shop on wheels, the shoemaker was pegging at his last, the axhandle manufacturers were using their drawing knives, and turning out handles with the same celerity that marked their labors at home, lathes, looms, steam engines, collar factories, trunk establishments and an endless variety of other trades and appliances of mechanical labor, were in full blast, in the vast stream of human industry, that moved along the streets to the enlivening music of six or eight brass bands. The procession was fully six miles in length and both in the novelty of its character and the immensity of its magnitude, astonished even the people in whose midst the industries existed. At night hundreds of Chinese lanterns illuminated the structure.|$|R
50|$|Atlantic Steel's history dated back to 1901 when it {{was founded}} as the Atlanta Hoop Company, with 120 employees, and which {{produced}} cotton bale ties and <b>barrel</b> <b>hoops.</b> It became the Atlanta Steel Company, and then in December 1915, the Atlantic Steel Company.|$|R

50|$|Brunelleschi's {{solutions}} were ingenious, {{and he used}} a catenary arch,. The spreading {{problem was}} solved {{by a set of}} four internal horizontal stone and iron chains, serving as <b>barrel</b> <b>hoops,</b> embedded within the inner dome: one at the top, one at the bottom, with the remaining two evenly spaced between them. A fifth chain, made of wood, was placed {{between the first and second}} of the stone chains. Since the dome was octagonal rather than round, a simple chain, squeezing the dome like a <b>barrel</b> <b>hoop,</b> would have put all its pressure on the eight corners of the dome. The chains needed to be rigid octagons, stiff enough to hold their shape, so as not to deform the dome as they held it together.|$|R
25|$|During the Middle-Ages, breech-loading swivel {{guns were}} {{developed}} by the Europeans also partly as a cheaper alternative to the very expensive bronze cast muzzle-loading cannons, as bronze was many times more expensive than iron. As cast iron was not yet technologically feasible for the Europeans, the only possibility was to use wrought iron bars hammered together and held with <b>hoops</b> like <b>barrels.</b> With this method, a one piece design was very difficult, and a fragmental structure, with separated chamber and barrel was then selected.|$|R
25|$|Massachusetts {{became a}} leader in {{industrial}} innovation and development during the 19th century. Since colonial times, {{there had been a}} successful iron making industry in New England. The first successful ironworks in America was established at Saugus in 1646, utilizing bog iron from swamps to produce plows, nails, firearms, <b>hoops</b> for <b>barrels</b> and other items necessary {{for the development of the}} Colony. Other industries would be established during this period, such as shipbuilding, lumber, paper and furniture making. These small-scale shops and factories often utilized the State's many rivers and streams to power their machinery.|$|R

Pandemics, such as the Spanish Flu of 1918, also reduced the population.|$|R

50|$|A barrel, cask, or tun is {{a hollow}} {{cylindrical}} container, traditionally made of wooden staves bound by wooden or metal <b>hoops.</b> Traditionally, the <b>barrel</b> was a standard size of measure {{referring to a}} set capacity or weight of a given commodity. For example, in the UK a barrel of beer refers to a quantity of 36 imp gal. Wine was shipped in barrels of 119 L.|$|R

50|$|Besides agriculture, boat {{building}} {{was one of}} the early industries until after the American Civil War. Johnsontown in Haverstraw was the seat of the first boat building.

50|$|Bombards {{developed}} in Europe were massive smoothbore weapons distinguished by {{their lack of}} a field carriage, immobility once emplaced, highly individual design, and noted unreliability (in 1460 James II, King of Scots, was killed when one exploded at the siege of Roxburgh). Their large size precluded the barrels being cast and they were constructed out of metal staves or rods bound together with <b>hoops</b> like a <b>barrel,</b> giving their name to the gun barrel.|$|R
5000|$|Sigil {{contains}} innumerable portals {{that can}} lead to anywhere in the Dungeons & Dragons cosmology: any bounded opening (a doorway, an arch, a <b>barrel</b> <b>hoop,</b> a picture frame) could possibly be a portal to another plane, or to another point in Sigil itself. Thus, the city is a paradox: it touches all planes at once, yet ultimately belongs to none; from these characteristics it draws its other name: [...] "The City of Doors".|$|R
50|$|From 1810 to 1816, {{the company}} was known as Lazell, Carey & Company and {{produced}} cannons during the War of 1812 and iron pots for the whaling industry, among other items, including cut nails and iron <b>hoops</b> for wooden <b>barrels.</b> In 1816, Carey died and {{the company was}} renamed Lazell, Perkins & Company.

50|$|Ladentown {{was named}} after Michel Leyden who was a nail cutter in the Ramapo works who {{sometimes}} spelt his name as Laden.

5000|$|The wooden {{parts that}} make up a barrel are called staves, while the rings that hold them {{together}} are called hoops. The latter are generally made of galvanized iron, though historically they were made of flexible bits of wood called withies. While wooden <b>hoops</b> could require <b>barrels</b> to be [...] "fully hooped", with hoops stacked tightly together along the entire top and bottom third of a barrel, iron-hooped barrels only require a few hoops on each end.|$|R
50|$|Immediately {{adjacent}} to the hut site to the northeast is a small grove of lime trees and shrubs. On {{the other side of}} this vegetation was a second hut/house pad and suspected hearth/fireplace. The house pad is a small levelled area covered by grasses but identifiable by an extant timber support and scatter of metal artefacts. Artefacts included a door bolt and hinge, metal <b>barrel</b> <b>hoop,</b> horse mouth-bit and U-frame and hook - possibly used to hang cooking pots over an open fire.|$|R
