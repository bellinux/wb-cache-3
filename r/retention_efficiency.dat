40|$|Erosion, transportation, and {{deposition}} of sediment into receiving waters can have substantial environmental and economic impacts. Sedimentation basins are a remediation technique used to limit sediment transport from earth disturbance activities. <b>Retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{is used as a}} measure of a sedimentation basin’s effectiveness. Several factors influence <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> including the type of principal spillway used. The most common spillway is the perforated riser which dewaters the basin throughout its entire vertical profile. However, a relatively new outlet device, the skimmer, has been developed, which dewaters the basin from the water surface. A laboratory study was conducted to compare the skimmer with the perforated riser for three different soil types and determine if there were any significant differences in the trapping efficiencies of the two outlets. The test basin dewatered over a three hour period. The parameters observed were dewatering rate, effluent sediment concentration, sediment loss rate, and <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The skimmer treatments consistently had higher values of sediment retention efficiencies.

Qualitative and quantitative {{determination of}} the presence of residual hydrocarbons in Kigwal/Kimondi, Nyando and Nzoia wetland ecosystems using Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) instrument indicated the presence of residual organochlorines, organophosphorus, carbamates and synthetic pyrethroid hydrocarbons in water, sediment and plant materials. In order to compare the <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the wetlands, the wetland ecosystems were divided into three different sections, namely: inlet, mid and outlet. Calculations of mass balances of residual halogenated and non-halogenated hydrocarbons at the respective sections was done taking into account the partition of the studied compounds in samples of water, sediments and papyrus reed plant materials and analyzed using validated Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS) method. From the analysis, several residual hydrocarbons namely: bendiocarb, benzene hexachloride (BHC), carbaryl, cypermethrin, decis, deltamethrin, diazinon, dieldrin, DDT, DDD, DDE, malathion, propoxur, sumithion, 5 -phenylrhodanine, 1, 3, 5 -trichlorobenzene, 1 -(2 -phenoxybenzyl) hydrazine were detected and quantified. The levels of the selected residual hydrocarbons in water samples were used to calculate the <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of a specific hydrocarbon and the values recorded. Generally, River Nyando wetland recorded mean percentage <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 76 and 94 % for dry and rainy seasons respectively; Kigwal/Kimondi wetland had seasonal mean percentage <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 63 to 78 %. River Nzoia also had calculated seasonal mean percentage <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of between 56 to 88 %.

40|$|Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) play {{a crucial}} role in {{studying}} cosmology and galactic chemical evolution. They are thought to be thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs) when their masses reach the Chandrasekar mass limit in binaries. Previous studies have suggested that He novae may be progenitor candidates of SNe Ia. However, the mass <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> during He nova outbursts are still uncertain. In this article, we aim to study the mass <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of He nova outbursts and to investigate whether SNe Ia can be produced through He nova outbursts. Using the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics, we simulated a series of multicycle He-layer flashes, in which the initial WD masses range from 0. 7 to 1. 35 Msun with various accretion rates. We obtained the mass <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of He nova outbursts for various initial WD masses, which can be used in the binary population synthesis studies. In our simulations, He nova outbursts can increase the mass of the WD to the Chandrasekar mass limit and the explosive carbon burning can be triggered in the center of the WD; this suggests that He nova outbursts can produce SNe Ia. Meanwhile, the mass <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in the present work are lower than those of previous studies, which leads to a lower birthrates of SNe Ia through the WD + He star channel.

Food types were fed to common sole (mean initial body weight: 44. 9 ± 2. 3 g) in excess {{three times a}} day over a 54 -day-period. The growth rate in common sole fed the natural prey (8. 5 g kg- 0. 8 d- 1) was significantly higher compared to the growth rate in fish fed the artificial feed (5. 1 g kg- 0. 8 d- 1). Nutrient and energy intake was significantly lower in common sole fed the artificial feed than in fish fed natural prey. The only exception was fat intake which was higher in common sole fed the artificial feed in contrast to fish fed the natural prey. Nutrient and energy <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were significantly lower in common sole fed the artificial feed than in fish fed the natural prey.

40|$|International audienceTo a large extent, the {{invertebrate}} fauna in wooded streams {{rely upon}} detritus inputs {{from the surrounding}} vegetation as their main food source. Conifer plantations may alter the timing and nutritional quality of leaf inputs into streams, but detritus retention may also be reduced. While {{it has often been}} assumed that conifer needles are retained less than broadleaved species, this has never been tested experimentally. This study describes the results of a leaf release experiment carried out in a small headwater stream, comparing the retention of pine needles and oak leaves (wet and dry) over a range of discharges. In addition, retention was compared before and after placing logs in the stream to examine the effect of woody debris on <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> was significantly different among the three leaf types tested with wet oak leaves being most retentive, followed by dry oak leaves with dry pine needles being least retentive. <b>Retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> declined significantly with increasing discharge for all three leaf types. The addition of logs increased the retention of dry oak leaves and pine needles, but not wet oak leaves. The predominant features (stones, logs, eddies and bankside vegetation) that accounted for retention varied with discharge and the leaf type used. The results indicate that while conifer needles may be inherently less retentive than broadleaves, the presence of woody debris within the stream channel increases their retention. However, this small-scale study would need to be expanded to investigate the retention dynamics of conifer needles in plantation streams. Nevertheless, management strategies that allow the formation of woody debris accumulations in plantation streams could be valuable in enhancing detritus retention and consequently could benefit invertebrate communities.

40|$|Abstract: The {{flexible}} {{regulation of}} feeding behaviour and nutrient metabolism {{is a prerequisite}} for consumers to grow and survive under variable food conditions. Thus, it is essential to understand the ecological trade-offs that restrict regulatory mechanisms in consumers to evaluate the consequences of nutrient limitations for trophic interactions. Here, we assessed behavioural and physiological adjustments to nutrient deficiencies in copepods and examined whether energy limitation, food digestibility or co-limitation with a second nutrient restricted compensatory mechanisms. A combination of 13 C-labelling and compound-specific stable isotope measurements revealed that copepods compensated nitrogen deficiencies by raising <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of amino acids (AA). The costs of higher <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were reflected in the doubling of structural fatty acids (FA), probably required for morphological adaptations of the gut. A depletion of highly unsaturated FA in storage lipids and their selective retention suggested that these FA became co-limiting and restricted a further increase in AA <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Copepods feeding on phosphorus-limited algae showed a marked increase in ingestion rates but were not fully able to compensate dietary deficiencies. The increase in ingestion rates was thereby not restricted by higher foraging costs because energy storage in copepods increased. Instead, thicker cell walls of nutrient-limited algae indicated that algal digestion resistance restricted the extent of surplus feeding. The strongly nutrient-specific response of copepods had large implications for recycling rates, growth efficiencies and the potential top-down control at the plant–animal interface. Compensatory mechanisms to mitigate nutrient deficiencies are therefore an essential aspect of trophic interactions and have the potential to alter the structure of food web...|$|R

We compared P retention between two urban/suburban SCMs and their adjacent free-flowing stream reaches at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Study (LTER) site, and examined changes in P retention in SCMs across flow conditions. Results show that, when compared with free-flowing stream reaches, the SCMs had significantly lower dissolved oxygen (%DO) and higher P concentrations, as well as lower mean areal retention rates and <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of particulate P (PP). In all the SCMs, concentrations of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) consistently exhibited inverse correlations with %DO that was lower during summer base flows. Particulate phosphorus (PP) concentrations peaked during spring high flow period in both streams and in-line pond/SCMs, but they were also higher during summer base flows in suburban/urban SCMs. Meanwhile, PP areal retention rates and <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the SCMs changed from positive (indicating retention) during high flows to negative (indicating release) during low flows, while such changes across flow were not observed in free-flowing stream reaches. We attribute the changing roles of SCMs from a PP sink to a PP source to changes in SCM hydrologic mass balances, physical sedimentation and biogeochemical mobilization across flows. This study demonstrates that in suburban/urban SCMs, P retained during high flow events can be released during low flows. Cultivation of macrophytes and/or frequent sediment dredging may provide potential solutions to retaining both P and nitrogen in urban SCMs...|$|R

From June to September 1995, we executed 6 short-term additions of N (as NH 4 Cl) and P (as Na 2 HPO 4) in a 200 -m section to measure nutrient uptake lengths. The study site included 2 clearly differentiated reaches in terms of canopy cover by riparian trees: the first 100 m were completely logged (i. e., the logged reach) and the remaining 100 m were left intact (i. e., the shaded reach). Trees were removed from the banks of the logged reach in the winter previous to our sampling. In the shaded reach, riparian vegetation was dominated by alders (Alnus glutinosa). The study was conducted during summer and fall months when differences in light availability between the 2 reaches were greatest because of forest canopy conditions. Algal biomass and % of stream surface covered by algae were higher in the logged than in the shaded reach, indicating that logging had a stimulatory effect on algae in the stream. Overall, nutrient <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> was higher (i. e., shorter uptake lengths) in the logged than in the shaded reach, especially for PO 4 -P. Despite a greater increase in PO 4 -P <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> relative to that of NH 4 -N following logging, <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> for NH 4 -N was higher than for PO 4 -P in both study reaches. The PO 4 -P mass-transfer coefficient was correlated with primary production in both study reaches, indicating that algal activity {{plays an important role in}} controlling PO 4 -P dynamics in this stream. In contrast, the NH 4 -N mass-transfer coefficient showed a positive relation-ship only with % of algal coverage in the logged reach, and was not correlated with any algal-related parameter in the shaded reach. The lack of correlation with algal production suggests that mechanisms other than algal activity (i. e., microbial heterotrophic processes or abiotic mechanisms) may also influence NH 4 -N retention in this stream. Overall, this study shows that logging disturbances in small shaded streams may alter in-stream ecological features that lead to changes in stream nutrient <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Moreover, it emphasizes that alteration of the tight linkage between the stream channel and the adjacent riparian zone may directly and indirectly impact biogeochemical processes with implications for stream ecosystem functioning...|$|E

Nitrate-N (NO− 3 -N), ammonium-N (NH+ 4 -N), total nitrogen-N (TN-N), total organic nitrogen-N (TON-N) and chloride (Cl−) concentrations were analyzed to calculate ni-trogen retention efficiencies. These wetland-streams consis-tently reduced water nitrogen concentration throughout the year with higher values for NO− 3 -N (72. 3 %), even though the mean value of inflow NO− 3 -N concentrations was above 20 mg l− 1. Additionally, they usually acted as sinks for TON-N (8. 4 %), but as sources for NH+ 4 -N. Over the entire study period, the Taray and Parra wetland-streams were capable of removing on average 1. 6 and 0. 8 kg NO− 3 -N a day− 1, re-spectively.

(initial weight, 13. 5 1 0. 1 g) {{were fed}} {{practical}} diets containing digestible protein to digestible energy (DP DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9) ratios of 25 - 30 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 as-fed using three protein levels (450, 500 and 550 g kg 2 ̆ 07 b 9) each at two lipid levels (110 and 160 g kg 2 ̆ 07 b 9) for 63 days. The results showed mean weight gain and {{feed conversion ratio}} were highest for diets containing 28. 5 and 30. 2 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9. DP DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 ratio had no significant effect on protein efficiency ratio except at the lowest level (24. 7 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9) indicating a protein sparing effect of higher lipid when dietary protein is below the requirement. Haddock appears to preferentially use protein as the prime source of DE. DP DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 ratio {{had little effect on}} apparent digestibility (AD) of protein while AD of lipid was significantly affected. Significant differences in AD of energy and organic matter were found to be inversely related to the carbohydrate level of the diet. DP DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 ratios of 28. 5 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 or lower resulted in significantly higher hepatosomatic indexes. The highest whole-body nitrogen gains and energy <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were achieved at 28. 5 and 30. 2 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9, whereas only slight differences in nitrogen <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were observed. The highest levels of energy retained in the form of protein were achieved at 28. 5 and 30. 2 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9. The diet that provided the best growth, feed utilization and digestibility with minimal HSI contained 546 g kg 2 ̆ 07 b 9 protein (513 g kg 2 ̆ 07 b 9 DP), 114 g kg 2 ̆ 07 b 9 lipid, 164 g kg 2 ̆ 07 b 9 carbohydrate, 17. 0 MJ kg DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 and a DP DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9 ratio of 30. 2 g DP MJ DE 2 ̆ 07 b 9.

40|$|Soils {{polluted}} with {{trace elements}} can become sources of pollution for surrounding {{soil and water}} resources {{as a result of}} dispersion of contaminated soil particles by water erosion. Vegetative filter strips (VFS) implemented downstream of the source of pollution may be used to trap sediments and their associated contaminants. An experimental flume was designed in order to test the potential of Lolium perenne and Trifolium repens VFS to retain sediment contaminated by As and Pb (Ath) or Zn and Cd (Prayon). T. repens with its creeping posture and large leaves had a higher sediment <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> (SRE = 47 %) than L. perenne with an erect posture (SRE = 26 %). Sedimentation upstream of and in the strip led to the selective retention of coarse particles and an enrichment in fine soil particles at the outlet of the flume. This effect was most marked for the T. repens VFS compared to L. perenne and bare soil. Consequently, for the Prayon soil, the <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> of Cd in T. repens VFS (53 %) was higher than the SRE (48 %) because Cd concentrations were 3 times higher in the sand fraction than in the clay fraction. On the contrary, the retention of Zn (48 %), which was distributed more homogeneously across particle size fractions, was similar to the SRE. For Ath, the retention of both As (26 %) and Pb (11 %) in the T. repens VFS was lower than the SRE (46 %) because both trace elements were preferentially associated with clay size particles. Trace element <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> of VFS may thus be higher or lower than the SRE depending on the distribution of trace elements among particle size classes. This {{must be taken into account}} in the proper design of VFS aimed at controlling off-site pollution by trace element-contaminated sediments...|$|E

40|$|Passive {{suspension}} feeders rely on {{surrounding flow}} to deliver food particles to them. Therefore, the classic conception of functional response (feeding rate vs. food concentration) may require modification {{to account for}} flow speed as a second independent variable. I compared the functional response of Polydora cornuta at different velocities and determined whether food capture was proportional to particle flux (concentration × velocity). To understand feeding responses at a mechanistic level, I measured the functional responses in terms of contact and capture rates and determined particle <b>retention</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Experiments were run separately with two sizes of food particles, and with juvenile or adult worms. For both worm sizes and both particle sizes, capture rate in weak flow was directly related to concentration, but in strong flow it was constant. Worms were therefore unable to benefit from abundant food when in strong flow. The critical velocity at which the capture rate became constant was lower for adult worms than for juvenile worms, and it was lower for small particles than for large particles. <b>Retention</b> <b>efficiency</b> was constant among all treatments, and the results for contact rate were {{essentially the same as}} for capture rate...|$|E
40|$|A {{full-scale}} remediation facility {{including a}} detention basin and a wetland was tested for retention of heavy metals and Poly-Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) from water drained from a motorway in The Netherlands. The facility {{consisted of a}} detention basin, a vertical-flow reed bed and a final groundwater infiltration bed. Water samples were taken of road water, detention basin influent and wetland effluent. By using automated sampling, {{we were able to}} obtain reliable concentration averages per 4 -week period during 18 months. The system retained the PAHs very well, with <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of 90 - 95 %. While environmental standards for these substances were surpassed in the road water, this was never the case after passage through the system. For the metals the situation was more complicated. All metals studied (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and Ni) had concentrations frequently surpassing environmental standards in the road water. After passage through the system, most metal concentrations were lower than the standards, except for Cu and Zn. There was a dramatic effect of de-icing salts on the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd and Ni, in the effluent leaving the system. For Cu, the concentrations even became higher than they had ever been in the road water. It is advised to let the road water bypass the facility during de-icing period...|$|R
40|$|Wetland environments are {{important}} {{sites for the}} cycling and retention of terrestrially derived organic matter and nutrients. Wetland treatment of agricultural runoff {{has been shown to}} improve water quality and promote carbon sequestration. However, the potential role of eutrophic wetlands as a source of algal loading contributing to downstream hypoxia has prompted interest in understanding algal productivity and export from these systems. This study, in the San Joaquin Valley, California, quantified a mass balance of carbon and nutrients within a seasonally-saturated constructed wetland receiving agricultural runoff, as well as quantifying autochthonous carbon production on four sampling dates during a year with minimal emergent vegetation. Results from this study show that the wetland was a net-sink for nutrients and particulate/dissolved organic carbon. Despite high concentrations of inflowing nutrients and high rates of primary productivity, high respiration rates limited net organic C production and export due to high heterotrophic activity. The addition of high C loads in inflowing water and moderate <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> however, resulted in a positive C retention during most sampling dates. This study provides valuable insight into the connection between elevated carbon and nutrient inflows, their effects on autochthonous carbon production, and resulting carbon and nutrient outflows. © Society of Wetland Scientists 2014...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{extensive}} {{applications of}} engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) {{can result in}} their release into waters. Membrane processes have great potential in reducing ENMs release. In that case, the issues of particular concern are membrane fouling caused by ENMs during separation processes. The objective {{of the present study}} is to improve the understanding of how ENMs are retained by membranes. An innovative methodology using confocal laser scanning microscopy (CSLM) is developed to locate fluorescent CdTe quantum dots (QDs) in different depths of fouled ultrafiltration membranes. With the help of image analysis software, both qualitative and quantitative information about the distribution of QDs in membranes are obtained. For low molecular weight cut off (MWCO) membranes (1, 5 and 10 kDa), QDs (sizes from 1 to 5 nm) distributed mainly around surfaces or on top of membranes, accompanied with near 100 % retention regardless of transmembrane pressure. As membrane MWCO increased (30 and 100 kDa), more QDs could pass through membranes accompanied with decreasing <b>retention</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and the occurrence of QDs was usually in deeper positions of membranes. Distribution results were in agreement with fouling analysis which demonstrated that standard blocking (internal fouling) and/or cake models (external fouling) frequently occurred during filtrations of QDs...|$|R
