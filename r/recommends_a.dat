5|$|Pregnant and {{breastfeeding}} women, {{who require}} 66% more daily iodine requirement than non-pregnant women, may still not be getting enough iodine. The World Health Organization <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> daily intake of 250µg for pregnant and breastfeeding women.

5|$|B.telmatiaea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It grows fairly quickly, but tends to become untidy as it ages. The flower spikes, though attractive, occur within the bush {{where they are}} usually {{obscured}} by foliage. In its natural habitat it flowers prolifically over several months, but according to George it {{may be reluctant to}} flower in cultivation. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage. George <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> sunny position in poorly drained soil, preferably with moisture in winter. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take around 14 days to germinate.|$|E

Three or four subjects must be taken at Higher level (HL) and the rest at Standard level (SL). The IB <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 240 hours of instructional time for HL courses and 150 hours for SL courses.|$|E
5|$|As planned, Mayweather boards Horizon and {{receives}} {{a warm welcome}} {{from most of the}} crew, including his mother Rianna. He also finds out that his brother, Paul, has been named acting captain, but he doesn't seem to be coping well with his new responsibilities. Mayweather offers to make a few repairs and upgrades to systems on the ship, but Paul tells him to stop, making him feel uneasy and out of place. Soon afterwards, the ship suddenly comes under attack, and a homing device is placed on the hull. Mayweather then <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> boost in the ship's fighting capability, but Paul insists that the safest course is to flee to the nearest port and yield the cargo as needed.|$|E

5|$|Banksia violacea {{is rarely}} cultivated. It is a slow-growing plant {{that tends to}} become untidy with age, and {{generally}} does not flower until {{four to five years}} after sprouting from seed. Flowers are an unusual colour, but occur within the bush where they grow within and are usually obscured by foliage. It tolerates light pruning not below the green foliage, except for the variant with a lignotuber, which may be pruned heavily. George <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> sunny position in light, sandy soil. Professor Margaret Bernard Sedgley of the Waite Institute suggests the species is of no value to floriculture, as the inflorescences are too small and obscured by the foliage, although she does add that the purple colour may be a worthwhile character to select for in plant breeding. Seeds do not require any treatment, and take 19 to 50 days to germinate.|$|E
5|$|The Mitchell Freeway {{is planned}} to {{continue}} {{north to the}} Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 {{the formation of the}} Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This would be followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue, by 2017 and then an expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos by 2021. Half-diamond interchanges are suggested for Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue.|$|E
5|$|Work on the {{new house}} began in 1685. The {{architect}} {{thought to have been}} responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, {{that it could have been}} the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde <b>recommends</b> <b>a</b> plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.|$|E
