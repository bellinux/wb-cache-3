25|$|An {{imperial}} order-in-council of 1825 {{which was}} designed to encourage the circulation of sterling coinage in all the colonies, actually had the reverse effect in the Canadas. It had the effect of driving out what little sterling specie coinage did actually circulate.

50|$|Equally {{significant}} to progressive-era reform were the crusading journalists, known as muckrakers. These journalists publicized, to middle class readers, economic privilege, political corruption, and social injustice. Their articles appeared in McClure's Magazine and other reform periodicals. Some muckrakers focused on corporate abuses. Ida Tarbell, for instance, exposed {{the activities of}} the Standard Oil Company. In The Shame of the Cities (1904), Lincoln Steffens dissected corruption in city government. In Following the Color Line (1908), Ray Stannard Baker criticized race relations. Other muckrakers assailed the Senate, railroad companies, insurance companies, and fraud in patent medicine.Novelists, too, criticized corporate injustices. Theodore Dreiser drew harsh portraits of a type of ruthless businessman in The Financier (1912) and The Titan (1914). In The Jungle (1906), Socialist Upton Sinclair repelled readers with descriptions of Chicago's meatpacking plants, and his work led to support for <b>remedial</b> food safety <b>legislation.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... § 7. The {{substance}} of this chapter once more {{reminds us of}} the incongruity between a perfect law and an imperfect State. The practicability of the principle here laid down varies directly as social morality. In a thoroughly vicious community its admission would be productive of anarchy.[1] In a completely virtuous one its admission will be both innocuous and inevitable. Progress toward a condition of social health--a condition, that is, in which the <b>remedial</b> measures of <b>legislation</b> will no longer be needed--is progress toward a condition in which those remedial measures will be cast aside, and the authority prescribing them disregarded. The two changes are of necessity co-ordinate. That moral sense whose supremacy will make society harmonious and government unnecessary is the same moral sense which will then make each man assert his freedom even to the extent of ignoring the State--is the same moral sense which, by deterring the majority from coercing the minority, will eventually render government impossible. And, as what are merely different manifestations of the same sentiment must bear a constant ratio to each other, the tendency to repudiate governments will increase only at the same rate that governments become needless.|$|R
2500|$|As Prime Minister, Bowell {{faced the}} Manitoba Schools Question.

2500|$|Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867, {{lists the}} major federal {{parliament}} powers, {{based on the}} concepts of peace, order, and good government. The act puts under {{the purview of the}} federal legislature <b>remedial</b> <b>legislation</b> on education rights, uniform laws relating to property and civil rights in all provinces other than Quebec, creation of a general court of appeal and other courts [...] "for the better Administration of the Laws of Canada" [...] (some aspects of the Supreme Court of Canada were elevated to constitutional status in 1982) and implementing obligations arising from foreign treaties. The act lists the powers of the provincial parliaments, including the exploration, development and export to other provinces of non-renewable natural resources, forestry resources and electrical energy (subject to the federal parliament's authority to regulate inter-provincial movement). Education is under provincial jurisdiction, subject to the rights of separate schools. Old-age pensions, agriculture and immigration are within federal and provincial jurisdictions. One prevails over the other, however; for pensions, federal legislation will not displace provincial laws and for agriculture and immigration it is the reverse. The Constitution Act, 1871 allowed parliament to govern any territories not forming part of any province, and the Statute of Westminster 1931, gave parliament the ability to pass extraterritorial laws.|$|E

The protocol is intended to facilitate rather than restrict any investigations, so it does not prescribe a particular approach that must be adopted in every case. Rather it provides a set of requirements, for the final datasets in particular, in terms of the core variables and the case selection criteria that will lead to comparability of datasets. This will bring about a European-wide agreement on how to collect this type of information, and if followed, will lead to comparable databases being held in each country that adopts and follows the protocol developed...|$|R
2500|$|The New York State Legislature then {{created the}} Factory Investigating Commission to [...] "investigate factory {{conditions}} {{in this and}} other cities and to report <b>remedial</b> measures of <b>legislation</b> to prevent hazard or loss of life among employees through fire, unsanitary conditions, and occupational diseases." [...] The Commission was chaired by Wagner and co-chaired by Al Smith. They {{held a series of}} widely publicized investigations around the state, interviewing 222 witnesses and taking 3,500 pages of testimony. They hired field agents to do on-site inspections of factories. They started with the issue of fire safety and moved on to broader issues of the risks of injury in the factory environment. Their findings led to thirty-eight new laws regulating labor in New York state, and gave them a reputation as leading progressive reformers working on behalf of the working class. In the process, they changed Tammany's reputation from mere corruption to progressive endeavors to help the workers. [...] New York City's Fire Chief John Kenlon told the investigators that his department had identified more than 200 factories where conditions made a fire like that at the Triangle Factory possible. The State Commissions's reports helped modernize the state's labor laws, making New York State [...] "one of the most progressive states in terms of labor reform." [...] New laws mandated better building access and egress, fireproofing requirements, the availability of fire extinguishers, the installation of alarm systems and automatic sprinklers, better eating and toilet facilities for workers, and limited the number of hours that women and children could work. [...] In the years from 1911 to 1913, sixty of the sixty-four new laws recommended by the Commission were legislated with the support of Governor William Sulzer.|$|R
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{money in}} Jamaica was Spanish copper coins called maravedíes. For nearly {{four hundred years}} Spanish dollars, known as pieces of eight were in widespread use on the world's trading routes, including the Caribbean Sea region. However, following the revolutionary wars in Latin America, the source of these silver trade coins dried up. The last Spanish dollar was minted at the Potosi mint in 1825. The United Kingdom had adopted the gold standard in 1821, and so 1825 was an opportune time to introduce the British sterling coinage into all the British colonies. An imperial order-in-council was passed in that year {{for the purposes of}} facilitating this aim by making sterling coinage legal tender in the colonies at the specified rate of $1 = 4s 4d (One Spanish dollar to four shillings and four pence sterling). As the sterling silver coins were attached to a gold standard, this exchange rate did not realistically represent the value of the silver in the Spanish dollars compared to the value of the gold in the British gold sovereign. Therefore the order-in-council had, in many colonies, the effect of actually driving sterling coinage out rather than encouraging its circulation. <b>Remedial</b> <b>legislation</b> had to be introduced in 1838 so as to change to the more realistic rate of $1 = 4s 2d. However, in Jamaica, British Honduras, Bermuda, and later in the Bahamas also, the official rating was set aside in favour of what was known as the 'Maccaroni' tradition in which a British shilling, referred to as a 'Maccaroni', was treated as one quarter of a dollar. The common link between these four territories was the Bank of Nova Scotia which brought in the 'Maccaroni' tradition, resulting in the successful introduction of both sterling coinage and sterling accounts. In 1834 silver coins of threepence and three half penny (1½ pence) were introduced, valued at ½ real and ¼ real. [...] The three halfpenny came to be called [...] "quartile" [...] or [...] "quatties." [...] These in particular were used in church collections due to a feeling by the black population that copper coins were inappropriate for that purpose. [...] Hence, they came to be called [...] "Christian quatties".|$|E
