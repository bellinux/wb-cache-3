The trematode Choledocystus elegans {{was found in the}} small intestine of the Leptodactylus paraensis in eastern Amazon and presents the following characteristics: several pointed tegumentary spines, papillae on the outer and inner edges of the oral and ventral suckers, a <b>round,</b> <b>well-developed</b> cirrus sac, a well-developed cirrus, oblique testicles, a ovary right side, uterine loops extending between the testicles, follicular vitellaria distributed throughout the body, starting at the genital pore region and caeca close the end of the body. For the first time, this study identified C. elegans parasitizing L. paraensis and describes morphological aspects never characterized using light and scanning electron microscopy...|$|E

5000|$|The milk-white, shining shell has an elongate-conic shape. Its length {{measures}} {{a little}} more than 6 mm. The 2½ whorls of the protoconch are very small. They form a rather elevated spire, having their axis at right angles to that of the succeeding turns, in the first of which they are about one-fourth immersed. The ten whorls of the teloconch are well rounded, very strongly tabulately shouldered at the summit,ornamented with <b>well-developed,</b> <b>rounded,</b> slightly protractively curved axial ribs. Of these ribs, 16 occur upon the first, second, and third, 18 upon the fourth and fifth, 20 upon the sixth, 22 upon the seventh, 24 upon the eighth, 26 upon the ninth, and 28 upon the penultimate turn. These ribs extend equally strong from the summit to the periphery of the whorls. The intercostal spaces are not quite as wide as the ribs. They are well impressed, extending anteriorly to the suture. The sutures are strongly constricted. The periphery of the body whorl is well rounded. The base of the shell is rather long, and well rounded. The entire surface of the spire and the base is marked by exceedingly fine spiral striations. The aperture is subquadrate. The posterior angle is obtuse. The outer lip is thin, showing the external sculpture within. The columella is almost straight, and slightly revolute.|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} to ionizing radiation, at the cellular level, {{depends on a}} number of factors that may be grouped into those that are genetically controlled, radiation quality, dosage, and environmental factors. The biological effects of low levels of ionizing radiation, and regulatory measures to protect people from exposure to low doses, have come in for much scrutiny in recent years. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the potential radioprotective properties of melatonin in exposed low dose irradiated mice. Kidney, is selected to study the effect of low dose gamma irradiation as it is a target organ of many other organs, which influence its function. Histopathological, and electron microscopical changes of the renal tubular structure of the kidney were studied in irradiated, and melatonin treated animals. Male adult albino mice were used in this experiment, they were divided into 5 main groups: the first was, served as control normal group. The 2 nd was given-in a fractionated dose of gamma radiation at a dose level (½ Gy) twice a week for eight weeks, while the third were left 8 more weeks without radiation. The 4 th group was given daily intraperitoneal, i. p. 10 mg/kg melatonin and irradiated by ½ Gy twice a week for eight weeks, and the 5 th was left 8 more weeks given melatonin only without irradiation. (All groups of animals were scarified at two time intervals 8 and 16 weeks). It could be observed that The intensity of the histological damage was more marked in the untreated irradiated group which irradiated for 8 weeks than those which are irradiated and left 8 more weeks without radiation irradiated. Hydropic change in the renal tubule, degenerative, narcotizing changes, and areas of complete proximal tubular necrosis and autolysis break down were detected. The protection offered by pretreatment with Mel. is particularly dramatic.. The proximal tubules retain its normality and structure; the nuclei were <b>rounded</b> with <b>well-developed</b> nuclear membrane and chromatin. On the other hand the distal tubules were well designed with many mitochondria and healthy nucleus. It could be reported that 10 mg/kg melatonin given Intraperitoneal, (i. p.) Daily to the irradiated animals helped very much the kidney to be protected from radiation injuries. The radioprotective effects of melatonin against cellular damage caused by radiation oxidative stress and its low toxicity make it a potential supplement in the treatment or co-treatment in situations where the effects of ionizing radiation are to be minimized...|$|R

40|$|AbstractLong term {{storage of}} CO 2 in {{geologic}} formations is currently {{considered the most}} attractive option to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to utilize fossil fuels for energy production. Injected CO 2 is expected to reside as a buoyant water-saturated supercritical fluid in contact with reservoir rock, the caprock system, and related formation waters. As reported by McGrail et al., experiments with basalts demonstrated surprisingly rapid carbonate mineral formation occurring with samples suspended in the supercritical CO 2 (sc CO 2) phase. Those experiments were limited to a few temperatures and CO 2 pressures representing relatively shallow (≈ 1 km) reservoir depths. Because continental flood basalts can extend to depths of 5  km or more, {{in this paper we}} extend the earlier results across a pressure-temperature range representative of these greater depths. Different basalt samples, including well cuttings from the borehole used in a pilot-scale basalt sequestration project (Eastern Washington, U. S.) and core samples from the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province, were exposed to aqueous solutions in equilibrium with sc CO 2 and water-rich sc CO 2 at six different pressures and temperatures for select periods of time (30 to 180 days). Conditions corresponding to a shallow injection of CO 2 (7. 4  MPa, 34  °C) indicate limited reactivity with basalt; surface carbonate precipitates were not easily identified on post-reacted basalt grains. Basalts exposed under identical times appeared increasingly more reacted with simulated depths. Tests conducted at higher pressures (≥ 12  MPa) and temperatures (≥ 55  °C), reveal a wide variety of surface precipitates forming in both fluid phases. Under shallow conditions tiny clusters of aragonite needles began forming in the wet sc CO 2 fluid, whereas in the CO 2 saturated water, cation substituted calcite developed thin radiating coatings. Although these types of coatings were sparse, conditions corresponding to deeper depths showed increasing carbonate precipitation. Basalts exposed to aqueous dissolved CO 2 (25. 5  MPa, 116  °C) for 30  days were coated in tiny nodules of precipitate (∼ 100  μm in diameter) that were identified by micro x-ray diffraction as ankerite, [Ca(Fe,Mg) (CO 3) 2], a variety of dolomite commonly associated with hydrothermal and metamorphic environments. Surface characterization by SEM revealed <b>well-developed</b> <b>round</b> nodules composed of discrete individual platelets. In contrast, reaction products forming on the basalt in the corresponding wet sc CO 2 phase had completely different morphology, appearing in an optical microscope as a surface coating instead of discrete nodules. Examination by SEM revealed layers of discrete platelets forming a cover over a few discrete nodules. Longer test durations (180  days) produced severe iron staining along with minerals structures similar to rhodochrosite and kutnohorite. These preliminary experiments show strong evidence of the faster rate of increase in mineralization reactions taking place in the sc CO 2 phase, transformation reactions that are just beginning to be explored in detail...|$|R
