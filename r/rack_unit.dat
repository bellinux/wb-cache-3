5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Dugan {{developed}} a gain limiting improvement to the automixing algorithm. The Dugan Gain Limiting System was patented in September 1989 and {{presented to the}} 87th AES convention in October. Dugan described for the AES his prototype of an automixer to be inserted into selected microphone channels of a mixing console, operated by a person, to help in mixing multiple live microphones to have less reverberation and noise, more focus on the desired sound, eliminating the mixing engineer's problem of too-slow human reaction time. The gain limiting system provided smooth, continuous control over the equivalent number of open microphones (NOM) that the automixer would send at its outputs. The NOM could be set anywhere between 1 and 10, with higher settings sounding more natural for a recording in a studio, and lower settings offering greater control of acoustic feedback {{in the presence of}} sound reinforcement loudspeakers. An embodiment of Dugan's three patents was produced as the Model D Automatic Mixing Controller, a 3U <b>rack</b> <b>unit</b> handling 8 channels which could be linked with up to 11 other Model Ds to automatically mix as many as 96 channels simultaneously.|$|E

2500|$|The song's lyrics were {{inspired}} by David Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity". The sound of the keyboard riff used in the recording was achieved by using a Yamaha TX-816 <b>rack</b> <b>unit</b> and a Roland JX-8P synthesizer, as described by Michaeli: [...] "I made a brassy sound from the JX-8P and used a factory sound from the Yamaha, and just layered them together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "The Final Countdown" [...] {{was based}} on an old {{keyboard}} riff that Tempest had composed as early as 1981–82, on a Korg Polysix keyboard he had borrowed from Michaeli. In 1985 bassist John Levén suggested that Tempest should write a song based on that riff. The lyrics were inspired by David Bowie's song [...] "Space Oddity".
