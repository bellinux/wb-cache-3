5000|$|The Multi-point <b>Refueling</b> Systems (MPRS) {{modification}} adds <b>refueling</b> pods to the KC-135's wings.

The pods themselves are Flight <b>Refueling</b> Limited (FRL) MK.32B model pods, and <b>refuel</b> via the probe and drogue method common to USN/USMC tactical jets, rather than the primary [...] "flying boom" [...] method used by USAF fixed-wing aircraft. This allows the tanker to <b>refuel</b> two receivers at the same time, which increases throughput compared to the boom drogue adapter.|$|R
