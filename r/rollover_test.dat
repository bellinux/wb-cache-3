This study investigated whether CECs and E-selectin are surrogate biomarkers of preeclampsia and if measurement of CECs and E-selectin, early in the third trimester, could be a means of predicting preeclampsia. Methods: In this prospective, descriptive-analytic study, <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> was performed on 523 pregnant women during 28 - 30 weeks of gestation. CECs were measured by anti-CD 146 -driven immunomagnetic isolation in women with posi-tive <b>rollover</b> <b>test.</b> They were followed up prospectively until delivery without any active intervention. Women with and without preeclampsia were determined. The number of CECs and level of E-selectin were compared in the two studied groups. Results: From the 47 pregnant women with positive <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> who were selected and followed up, 22 individuals were diagnosed with preeclampsia while the remainder were normotensive. Mean CEC numbers was significantly high-er in preeclamptic women than normal pregnancies (24. 7 cells/mL vs. 13 cells/mL).

40|$|Abstract:—Road {{transport}} is {{the most}} commonly used way of transportation in India and in many countries. The passenger bus {{plays an important role in}} public transport. The capacity of carrying more passengers compared to other road transport medium is unfavourable in the event of major bus accident. The rollover crash accident of passenger bus, although occurs less frequently than any other type of accident, the fatality rate and severe injuries are highest in rollover crash. Hence the structure of the bus needs to be strong enough to ensure the minimum damage and at the same time it should absorb maximum impact energy. Safety regulations are in force defining minimum structural rigidity under rollover crash. The Automotive Industry Standard (AIS- 031) is implemented in India since October 2008 which specifies the requirements and methods to calculate the strength of superstructure of buses during and after rollover. The AIS- 031 specifies four different test methods viz. physical <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> on a complete vehicle, <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> on a body section, pendulum test on a body section, and verification of strength of superstructure by calculation (numerical simulation). In this work numerical simulation of <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> using finite element method is followed. First the numerical model is build according to the guidelines provided in AIS- 031 and validated by the experimental testing.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop the {{analytical}} methodology to evaluate the dynamic versus residual roof deformation characteristics of a compact SUV subjected to SAE J 2114 dolly <b>rollover</b> <b>tests.</b> Two FMVSS 208 dolly <b>rollover</b> <b>tests</b> with instrumented, restrained driver side Hybrid III dummies were evaluated during the first driver’s side roof rail ground strike. Kinematic targets were mounted on the driver dummy head and tracked via onboard cameras as a means of visual validation of roof rail deformation (assuming rail-to-dummy head contact). Test instrumentation included: accelerometers at the vehicle center of gravity (CG), roof rail, pillars and rocker panel, lap and shoulder belt load transducers, triaxial accelerometers at the center of gravity of the head, chest and pelvis of the dummies and six-axis force (and moment) transducers in the neck of the dummy. All data was recorded consistent with SAE J 211 - 1 recommendations Vehicle angular velocity and attitude were estimated using the data from multiple accelerometers, which correlated well with the test video. The accelerometer data indicate that the driver roof rail dynamic deformation was significantly greater than the residual deformation to which the roof rail rebounded following loss of ground contact. The dynamic deformation was of such magnitude that the rail intruded into the driver’s occupant survival space. A spike in driver dummy head acceleration was observed immediately following the acceleration pulse that caused the rail intrusion The presence of significant dynamic roof rail deformation is new and important quantitative information that should be added to the body of knowledge surrounding reconsideration of FMVSS 216 and catastrophic injury prevention in rollover crashes...|$|R

40|$|Seatbelt {{performance}} in rollovers {{has come under}} increased scrutiny in recent years. This is due, in part, to growing popularity of sport utility vehicles which have a demonstrated inferior rollover resistance when compared to passenger cars [1]. In the United States (U. S.) the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has stated an intent to mandate {{an increase in the}} roof strength safety standard. Such an improvement in roof strength will undoubtedly bring an increased focus on the performance of seatbelts in rollovers. Many contemporary seatbelt retractors are equipped with both a vehicle crash sensor as well as a secondary, or backup, webbing sensor. The webbing sensor is intended as a backup locking device {{in the event of a}} failure of the primary inertially sensitive vehicle sensor. The crash modes presenting the most potential for the inertial sensor’s failure include non-planar crashes, multiple impacts, and rollovers [2]. It follows, therefore, that to ensure reliable seatbelt retractor lockup in these modes, the redundant webbing sensor must be tuned with a lockup threshold consistent with expected occupant motions and webbing extraction rates seen during these events. <b>Rollover</b> <b>tests</b> conducted by NHTSA wherein the belt systems were instrumented for both load and webbing payout were analyzed. This analysis provides insight for determining a baseline lockup threshold for the webbing sensor required to ensure activation in the rollover crash mode. Additionally, multiple retractors designed for both European and U. S. markets have been tested on a bench-top sled. These tests were conducted to include out-of-plane accelerations similar to those observed in rollover crashes. The retractor sled test results, along with the analysis of the NHTSA <b>rollover</b> <b>tests,</b> are then discussed and used to develop a suggested webbing sensor lockup threshold necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the redundant and backup webbing crash sensor in real-world events...|$|R
40|$|Serious head {{injuries}} {{are a major}} concern in light passenger vehicle rollover crashes.

However, detailed information about the characteristics of serious {{head injuries}} in single-vehicle single-event, i. e. pure, rollover crashes, and regarding {{the capabilities of the}} dynamic <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> devices chosen for the separate US and Australian investigations, is lacking. To address this knowledge gap, two crash databases are investigated to describe the characteristics of head injuries and associated crash factors for pure rollover crashes in Australia and the US. Results from 80 dynamic rollover tests are analysed to evaluate the effects various test methods have on replicating and measuring ATD head response associated with serious head injury. The structural and kinematic responses of 48 vehicles in 83 tests conducted using the Jordan Rollover System (JRS) are evaluated. Logistic regression analysis is used to assess the relationship between the structural response of JRS-tested vehicles, and the occurrence of incapacitating or fatal injury in single-vehicle rollover crashes. Finally, a human body finite element model is subjected to impact conditions identified from dynamic rollover tests to demonstrate the effect of rollover-related impact parameters on a pattern of head and spine injury observed in crash data. The original findings of this thesis include details about head injury characteristics not previously reported, a re-evaluation of head response in physical rollover tests using brain and skull injury measures that have never been reported in physical rollover tests, the first comprehensive and systematic assessment of JRS test results, the first statistical model describing the relationship between vehicle performance in a dynamic <b>rollover</b> <b>test</b> and the odds of injury in rollover crashes, and the first demonstration of the significance of rollover-related impact parameters on the production of relevant head and spine injury patterns.

40|$|In {{this work}} the multibody (MB) {{approach}} {{has been used to}} study the structural behaviour of a M 3 bus in a rollover accident, to evaluate the structure resistance and passenger injury risks. This research is part of the ECBOS project (Enhanced Coach and Bus Occupant Safety), granted by the European Union. The interest was focused on the effect of a rollover accident over the structure and the passengers. For what concerns the rollover of a bus, in Europe the regulation for safety approval is the ECE Regulation 66 [1]. This regulation prescribes a test to be chosen between four of different kind: a complete bus <b>rollover</b> <b>test,</b> a bay section <b>rollover</b> <b>test,</b> a pendulum test and a numerical simulation of a rollover. The choice between these tests is completely up to the coach manufacturer. It is important to underline that in all these tests the presence of passengers is not considered. The effect of the mass of the occupants over the superstructure and the injury risk for passengers in a rollover accident was evaluated considering different configurations. Only a bay section has been modelled: in a rollover event, with rotation axis parallel to the longitudinal bus axis, the behaviour of the bay section is well representative of the whole structure. To generate the virtual model of the bay section, the plastic hinge concept has been adopted by using generalized spring elements to represent the constitutive characteristics of localized plastic deformations. The program chosen to carry out the simulations is MADYMO, a MB-FE software developed by TNO, which has a complete library of virtual dummies. The numerical analysis has given prominence to the inadequacy of the actual European regulation (ECE 66), concerning passive safety. The mass increment due to presence of the passengers affects significantly the deformation of the superstructure and the absence of any prescription of restrain systems does not permit to protect the passengers against very serious or fatal injurie...|$|E

As reported in the open literature, various test methods for conducting rollover events such as SAE J 2114, Side Curb Trip, Critical Sliding Velocity, and Corkscrew have been used. This paper presents the development of MADYMO-based models for simulating vehicle kinematics in these four modes. The CAE methodologies using MADYMO is interactively developed with the test methodologies. Experimental data obtained from these test modes are used for developing rollover CAE models for replicating vehicle motions under similar test conditions. Analyses of simulated results provide feedback to improve the test procedures. Testing with improved procedures provide additional new data for continued model refinements. MADYMObased CAE tools thus provide quality models with better simulated and/or predicted results. MADYMO rollover models consist of sprung and un-sprung masses, suspension systems and tires, whose characteristics are extracted from ADAMS-based vehicle handling model. Use of the MADYMO-based models to support <b>rollover</b> <b>testing,</b> <b>rollover</b> sensing algorithm development, and rollover protection system development will be described. Since MADYMO modeling described in this paper is a rigid-body based approach, model limitations and issues associated with rollover simulation will also be discussed. In addition, model correlations with test data in these four modes and future areas of improvement will be presented...|$|R
