5|$|Cortinarius iodes {{produces}} a rusty-brown spore print. Spores are elliptical, with a finely <b>roughened</b> surface, measuring 8–10 by 5–6.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 28–39.5 by 9.3–14μm. Both cheliocystidia and pleurocystidia are {{absent from the}} hymenium; the gill edge is populated by basidia and their undeveloped equivalents, basidioles. The cap cuticle comprises a distinctive layer of 3–8μm-wide hyphae that form a layer usually 110–125μm thick; this layer is less distinct or thinner in old or poorly preserved specimens. Clamp connections are present in hyphae throughout the fruit body.|$|E

Two twelve-hour shifts ensured non-stop production, with around 140 prisoners working. The printed sheets, each containing four notes, were dried and cropped using a steel ruler; the edges were <b>roughened</b> to imitate the deckle finish of the British notes. The operation peaked between mid-1943 and mid-1944, with approximately 65,000 notes a month produced from six flat-bed printing presses.|$|E

The phase diagram contains the line of ordering phase transitions and, at lower temperatures, the line of <b>roughening</b> phase transitions, where the interface between ordered domains <b>roughens.</b> Upon increasing the anisotropy, <b>roughening</b> transition temperatures settle after the isotropic case, whereas the ordering transition temperature increases to infinity.

It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling.

5|$|Of these viruses {{the most}} serious and {{prevalent}} are NDV, NYSV and NWSV. NDV is associated with chlorotic leaf striping in N. tazetta. Infection with NYSV produces light or grayish green, or yellow stripes or mottles on the upper two-thirds of the leaf, which may be <b>roughened</b> or twisted. The flowers which may be smaller than usual may also be streaked or blotched. NWSV produces greenish-purple streaking on the leaves and stem turning white to yellow, and premature senescence reducing bulb size and yield. These viruses are primarily diseases of commercial nurseries. The growth inhibition caused by viral infection can cause substantial economic damage.|$|E

They noted, however, that the genus did not fit well in a more {{restricted}} concept of the family due to its lack of a germ pore and <b>roughened</b> spore walls. More recently, taxonomic authorities have placed the genus in the family Psathyrellaceae; molecular analysis shows it to be most closely allied to this group. Mythicomyces and Stagnicola form a clade that is sister {{to the rest of}} the family.|$|E

As a modification of the transverse Ising model with short range interactions, which has been shown to exhibit domain wall <b>roughening,</b> we have looked into the possibility of a <b>roughening</b> transition for the case of long-range interactions, since such a system is physically realized in the insulator LiHoF 4.

The Ag (110) experiments provide direct evidence that the silver surface undergoes a <b>roughening</b> transition at TR = 450 ° C. Above TR, the rough phase is characterized by logarithmically divergent height fluctuations. For Au (110), it is found that at Tc = 485 ° C the 1 x 3 surface undergoes a reversible transition to a structure incommensurate with the bulk crystalline lattice.

5|$|According to Alexander H. Smith's {{organization}} of the genus Mycena, M.aurantiomarginata is classified in section Calodontes, subsection Granulatae, which contains species with <b>roughened</b> cheilocystidia (cystidia on gill edges), such as M.rosella, M.flavescens, M.elegans, and M.strobilinoides. In his 1992 study of Mycena, Dutch mycologist Rudolph Arnold Maas Geesteranus put M.aurantiomarginata in the section Luculentae, characterized by species with an olive to yellowish-olive and moist cap, pallid to gray-olive gills with bright orange margins, brownish to grayish-olive stipes, white spore deposit, and spiny cystidia. M.aurantiomarginata was included in a 2010 molecular analysis focused on clarifying the phylogenetic relationships between Northern European species in the section Calodontes. The results suggested that, based on the similarity of nuclear large subunit ribosomal DNA sequences, the fungus {{is closely related to}} M.crocata and M.leaiana. This conclusion was previously corroborated by research that used molecular analysis to demonstrate that several Mycena species can be mycorrhizal partners of the orchid Gastrodia confusa.|$|E
5|$|In K. guimarotae, the {{two halves}} of the dentary diverge from each other at an angle of 20° near the front, then 40° near the back. It also bears two convexities {{on the bottom of the}} jaw, one at the third and fourth teeth and another at the eighth to tenth teeth. The latter {{convexity}} is replaced by a concavity in K. langenbergensis. In both species, the top margin of the jaw behind the tooth row slopes upwards in a straight line. The side of the dentary is pitted, albeit much more densely so in K. langenbergensis. Near the back of the dentary in both species, the pits are replaced by longitudinal grooves. On the interior of the jaw, the splenial bears an oval foramen behind the level of the symphysis in both species, and the top of the bone bears a low and <b>roughened</b> crest in K. guimarotae.|$|E
5|$|Like Probactrosaurus {{and other}} hadrosauroids, {{the back of}} the maxilla connects to the jugal – which borders the bottom of the eye socket and infratemporal fenestra – through a finger-like {{projection}} that fits into a recess. The bottom margin of the jugal bears a strong flange beneath the level of the infratemporal fenestra; this is also seen in Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and several other hadrosauroids. Connecting to the jugal from above is the postorbital, which has a <b>roughened</b> surface where it borders the eye sockets (like Protohadros), but the side of the bone is otherwise smooth. At {{the back of the}} skull, the quadrate articulates with the squamosal with a joint that is D-shaped when viewed from the top. The left and right squamosals would have contacted each other extensively, being only separated at the back by a small process of the parietal. The supraoccipital bone, which forms the top portion {{of the back of the}} skull, is flat and nearly vertical, as is the case in Probactrosaurus and other hadrosauroids.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} curvature-driven <b>roughening</b> of a disk domain pattern with a {{variable}} interface window. The relaxation of interface {{is driven by}} negative surface tension. When a domain boundary propagates radially at a constant rate, we found that evolution of interface roughness follows scaling dynamic behavior. The local growth exponents are substantially different from the global exponents. Curvature-driven <b>roughening</b> belongs to {{a new class of}} anomalous <b>roughening</b> dynamics. However, a different surface tension leads to different global exponents. This is different from that of interface evolution with a fixed-size window, which has universal exponent. The variable growth window leads to a new class of anomalous <b>roughening</b> dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Kinetic <b>roughening</b> {{is not a}} phase {{transition}} and, as such, it lacks an exact definition. Many criteria are used to mark the onset of kinetic <b>roughening.</b> Criteria stemming from the classical two-dimensional nucleation theory are widely used. On the other hand, experimentalists observe a transition from flat to rounded crystal facets at certain driving forces. And measuring the growth rate {{as a function of}} driving force, a change from exponential to linear growth kinetics is frequently found. It is assumed that these experimental phenomena coincide with the onset of kinetic <b>roughening.</b> These experimental criteria, three classical criteria for kinetic <b>roughening</b> and statistical mechanical criteria based on the interface width and the surface roughness, are compared with each other by means of Monte Carlo simulations on a Kossel (100) SOS model. Surface diffusion is neglected, and only attachment/detachment kinetics is considered. The change from flat to rounded facets with increasing driving force turns out to be quite gradual. Nevertheless, this experimental criterion is made explicit by defining a critical driving force for which the curvature of a facet becomes visible by optical microscopy. The conditions for an experiment to detect kinetic <b>roughening</b> using this criterion are described. The different criteria for kinetic <b>roughening</b> yield different values for the critical driving force, although most of the criteria studied show a similar, almost linear, dependence of the critical driving force on the nearest neighbor bond strength. This again indicates that kinetic <b>roughening</b> is diffuse in nature, and shows that in discussions on kinetic <b>roughening</b> it is imperative to mention the criterion used. Some attention is also paid to the two-dimensional anisotropy of step motion on a Kossel (100) surface. An anisotropic step velocity is found far below thermal <b>roughening.</b> The anisotropy is reduced by increasing the driving force...|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} {{of solid}} source {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE) lattice-matched GaInP-GaAs heterostructures has been studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). It is shown that atomic-scale <b>roughening</b> occurs in the first several (;five) interfaces, and beyond which <b>roughening</b> is developed into micrometer-scale. The { 113 } faceted <b>roughening</b> occurs in the GaInP-on-GaAs interfaces, leading {{to the formation of}} V-shaped grooves. Dislocation dipoles are observed in the top, facet surface and bottom regions of the grooves, and there is no obvious difference. For GaInP layers exhibiting atomic-scale <b>roughening,</b> a small number of dislocations, mostly 608 -type and in a dipole configuration, are confined in a zone of approximately 5. 0 nm in width along the interface, and dislocations are rare deep inside the layers. For GaInP layers, in contrast, there is a high density of dislocations in both the regions, and it has remarkable interfacial <b>roughening.</b> Based on their distribution and configurations, the dislocations are believed to result from the compositional modulation occurred in the GaInP layers. The interplay of <b>roughening,</b> dislocations and compositional modulation has been discussed {{in the light of the}} morphological features. 2001 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
5|$|The crestless {{skull of}} Eolambia {{has a similar}} overall shape to those of Equijubus and Probactrosaurus. The front of the snout is highly <b>roughened,</b> being punctuated by many foramina. At the tip of each premaxilla, there are two tooth-like {{structures}} known as denticles, which is also seen in its closest relative Protohadros. Further back, the rear portion of the lower branch of the premaxilla abruptly projects upwards, closing off the nostril at the rear as in Probactrosaurus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. This part joins with the two finger-like processes of the maxilla, {{which is similar to}} Protohadros. The body of the maxilla itself does not bear a recess or any indication of an antorbital fenestra, like Equijubus, Protohadros, and other hadrosauroids. One of the characteristics used to distinguish Eolambia is the concave profile of the tooth row of the maxilla when viewed from the side, which is like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, and several other hadrosauriforms but unlike Protohadros.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is pale purplish brown. Spores are ovoid (egg-shaped) to {{somewhat}} ellipsoidal, binucleate (visible when stained with acetocarmine solution), often contain a single oil droplet, and measure 6–8.5 by 4–5.5µm. The spore walls are <b>roughened</b> with small points and ridges, {{and have a}} small plage. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 24–26 by 6–8.5µm. Cystidia on the gill face (pleurocystidia) are abundant. They are spindle-shaped with swollen middles, and thick tips that are occasionally encrusted with translucent crystals. They have dimensions of 43–86 by 10–24µm, with walls that are pale brown to translucent, and up to 3µm thick. Cystidia on the gill edge (cheilocystidia) are roughly the same morphologically, but shorter. The cap cuticle comprises a layer of radially arranged gelatinized hyphae measuring 1–4µm in diameter. Clamp connections {{are present in the}} hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The tip of {{the angular}} is {{situated}} close to {{the midpoint of the}} bone in K. langenbergensis rather than being at the back as in K. guimarotae. In both species, the back of the angular contributes to the retroarticular process. The inner surface of the angular is <b>roughened</b> in K. guimarotae, and the top margin of the inner wall transitions from an upward-projecting tip at the front to a low, rounded crest at the back; the same margin maintains its height along the angular in K. langenbergensis. The surangular bears a thin, forward-projecting process that, in K. langenbergensis, extends forward {{to the back of the}} tooth row and bears a groove on the bottom. The presence of the oval-shaped external mandibular fenestra is unique to the genus among atoposaurids.|$|E

We demonstrate that surface <b>roughening</b> couples to phase separation. For films undergoing lateral phase separation via a transient wetting layer, this results in distinct stages of <b>roughening</b> as the film evolves between different phase equilibria...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Surface <b>roughening</b> is an {{undesirable}} {{feature in}} materials. This work investigates {{the cause of}} surface <b>roughening</b> in four plates of AA 6061 with different thicknesses (Le. 6 mm, 9 mm and two 12 mm). Production of these plates requires thermomechanical processing of the cast slab via a two stage process, namely the initial rolling stage on a hot roughing mill (HRM) and final rolling on the hot finishing mill (HFM). After rolling. the plates are levelled by a tensile stretching process and it is during this process that surface <b>roughening</b> of the plates can arise. Three of these plates exhibited severe <b>roughening</b> and the other 12 mm thick plate exhibited mild surface <b>roughening</b> during the stretch levelling process. Investigations looked closely at how the cause of surface <b>roughening</b> {{is related to the}} thermomechanical processing. The four products studied exhibited different degrees of surface <b>roughening</b> during uniaxial tensile deformation. Detailed investigation of the microstructure of these four products was carried out. It was found that the plates that exhibited severe <b>roughening</b> had large flat and elongated grains at the surface. It is the rotation of these surface grains during tensile deformation that was thought to be inducing the roughness in the material. The microstructure evolution was explained relative to the thermomechanical history of the plates. Plane strain compression (PSC) tests were used to simulate the thermomechanical processing cycles on the HFM. Large strain rates used in the industry were compensated with an adjustment in temperature so that an equivalent Zener-Holloman parameter (Z) could be achieved. The microstructure of the PSC specimen was characterised using the electron back scattered technique. It was found that the grain size increases with a decrease in the value of Z...|$|R

5|$|Fruit : A capsule that {{is usually}} loculicidal (splitting along the locules) as in the Lilioideae, but {{occasionally}} septicidal (splitting between them, along the separating septa) in the Calachortoideae and wind dispersed, although the Medeoleae form berries (baccate). The seeds may be flat, oblong, angular, , ellipsoid or globose (spherical), or compressed with a well developed epidermis. The exterior may be smooth or <b>roughened,</b> with a wing or raphe (ridge), aril or one to two tails, rarely hairy, but may be dull or shiny {{and the lack of}} a black integument distinguishes them from related taxa such as Allioideae that were previously included in this family, and striate (parallel longitudinally ridged) in the Steptopoideae. The hilum (scar) is generally inconspicuous. The bitegmic (separate testa and tegmen) seed coat itself may be thin, suberose (like cork), or crustaceous (hard or brittle). The endosperm is abundant, cartilaginous (fleshy) or horny and contains oils and aleurone but not starch (non-farinaceous). Its cells are polyploid (triploid or pentaploid, depending on the embryo sac type). The embryo is small (usually less than one quarter of seed volume), axile (radially sectioned), linear (longer than broad) or rarely rudimentary (tiny relative to endosperm) depending on placentation type, and straight, bent, curved or curled at the upper end.|$|E
5|$|The interclavicle is a {{large plate}} with a smooth upper surface and a {{prominent}} groove on the bottom surface. It also bears a small, pointed projection at its back end. The scapulae have prominent shelves on each side (diagnostic of leptocleidids and polycotylids, but not strongly differentiated in elasmosaurids), and their glenoids are clearly concave, with <b>roughened</b> attachments for cartilage. The two coracoids curve outwards {{in the middle and}} contact at their ends, forming a hole in the middle, although the exact morphology of this hole is uncertain. The regions where the coracoids contact is vaulted and thickened to form a weak, ridge-like projection, comparable to but probably convergently acquired from elasmosaurids. The pubes form a somewhat rectangular dish, with a convex front edge and concave outer edge, while the ischia are flat, triangular, and plate-like. The edges of the pubes where they meet the ischia curve inwards from the midline to each side. The corresponding edges of the ischia are similarly-shaped, with the curved edges of the bones collectively forming two rounded fenestrae that are connected in the center by a small rhombus-shaped opening, as also seen in Futabasaurus. The ilia are rod-shaped and bent, with blunt projections halfway along their outer rims; at the top end, they are flattened into a fan-like shape.|$|E
5|$|In nature, Suillus spraguei forms ectomycorrhizal {{relationships}} with five-needled pine species. This is a mutually beneficial relationship where the hyphae of the fungus grow around {{the roots of}} the trees, enabling the fungus to receive moisture, protection and nutritive byproducts of the tree, and affording the tree greater access to soil nutrients. S.spraguei produces tuberculate ectomycorrhizae (covered with wart-like projections) that are described as aggregates of ectomycorrhizal roots encased in a fungal rind, and rhizomorphs that are tubular fungal cords with a hard outer sheath. The fungus has ecological host specificity, and in natural soils can only associate with white pine, a grouping of trees classified in subgenus Strobus of the genus Pinus. However, under controlled pure culture conditions in the laboratory, S.spraguei has also been shown to form associations with Red Pine, Pitch Pine, and Loblolly Pine. Asian populations have been associated with Korean Pine, Chinese White Pine, Siberian Dwarf Pine and Japanese White Pine. In North America, fruit bodies appear earlier than most other boletes, as early as June (bolete fruit bodies generally begin to appear in July–September), although they may be found as late as October. Mushrooms can be parasitized by the fungus Hypomyces completus. In the asexual stage of H.completus, it appears initially as patches of whitish mold {{on the surface of the}} cap or stem that rapidly spread to cover the entire mushroom surface and produce conidia (asexual spores). In the sexual stage, the mold changes color, progressing from yellow-brown to brown, greenish-brown and eventually black as it makes perithecia, asci-containing sexual structures that produce ascospores. The perithecia are pimply and give the surface a <b>roughened</b> texture.|$|E
