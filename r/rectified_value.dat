40|$|AbstractIt has {{recently}} been shown that motor units in human medial gastrocnemius (MG), activated during standing, occupy relatively small territories along the muscle’s longitudinal axis. Such organisation provides potential for different motor tasks to produce differing regional patterns of activity. Here, we investigate whether postural control and nerve electrical stimulation produce equal longitudinal activation patterns in MG. Myoelectric activity, at different proximal–distal locations of MG, was recorded using a linear electrode array. To ensure differences in signal amplitude between channels did not result from local, morphological factors two experimental protocols were completed: (i) quiet standing; (ii) electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. Averaged, <b>rectified</b> <b>values</b> (ARVs) were calculated for each channel in each condition. The distribution of signals along electrode channels was described using linear regression and differences between protocols at each channel determined as the ratio between mean ARV from standing: stimulation protocols. Ratio values changed systematically across electrode channels in seven (of eight) participants, with larger values in distal channels. The distribution of ARV along MG therefore differed between experimental conditions. Compared to fibres of units activated during MG nerve stimulation, units activated during standing may {{have a tendency to}} be more highly represented in the distal muscle portion...|$|R

Prior to the main test, the optimal pre-fixed load corresponding to the highest power output was selected following a random series of six 10 -s sprints. Surface electromyographic (EMG) signals were detected from the right vastus lateralis with linear adhesive arrays of eight electrodes. Power output decreased significantly from 6 -s {{until the end of the}} test (860. 9 +/- 207. 8 vs. 360. 9 +/- 11. 4 W, respectively) and was correlated with MFCV (R = 0. 543, P < 0. 01), which also declined significantly by 26. 8 +/- 11 % (P < 0. 05). There was a tendency for the mean frequency of the EMG power spectrum (MNF) to decrease, but average <b>rectified</b> <b>values</b> (ARV) remained unchanged throughout the test. The parallel decline of MFCV with power output suggests changes in fibre membrane properties.

40|$|Spatial {{dependency}} of paraspinal muscle {{activity was}} assessed using a new two-dimensional MMG recording system. MMG signals were detected over {{the left and right}} paraspinal muscles of 10 volunteers using a grid of 12 accelerometers. During two separate trials subjects maintained a 20 degrees flexed position and held loads that ranged from 0 to 15 kg (in 2. 5 kg increments) for 20 s; and 7. 5 kg for 6 min. Maps of absolute and normalised (with respect to initial values) average <b>rectified</b> <b>value,</b> mean power frequency, variance and skewness of the power spectral density were obtained from the two-dimensional MMG recordings. For both the short duration and sustained contractions, the MMG absolute average <b>rectified</b> <b>value,</b> mean power frequency, variance and skewness depended on accelerometer location (P < 0. 05), while, {{with the exception of the}} skewness (P < 0. 05), normalised values did not. These results demonstrate both inhomogeneous MMG absolute activity and homogeneous MMG normalised activity in paraspinal muscles for short duration and sustained contractions. Moreover, the effect of accelerometer location on spectral variables confirmed the limited validity of general relationships between MMG spectral changes and motor unit recruitment strategies. This study underlines the importance of using multiple recording sites when assessing back muscle activity. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
30|$|For {{detecting}} EPI {{events from}} the Swarm electron density measurements, {{we used the}} same approach as described by (Xiong et al. 2010). Electron density (Ne) time series from each equatorial orbital segment (within ± 40 ° magnetic latitude, MLAT) are first high-pass filtered with a cutoff period of 40  s, corresponding to an along-track wavelength of about 300  km. The magnetic latitude we used is calculated by the Apex or Quasi-Dipole magnetic field model, which has been defined by Richmond (1995) and updated by Emmert et al. (2010). Subsequently, the filtered signal is <b>rectified.</b> <b>Values</b> exceeding an upper limit (UL) are identified as an EPI event. For each event, the rectified signal should have multi-peaked values above UL, and this event is limited along the orbit, by rectified signals below a lower limit (LL) for at least 3 ° {{north and south of}} the event. Otherwise, the fluctuations of rectified signal are attributed to enhanced noise and are considered as not significant. The thresholds of UL and LL are set here to 3  ×  1010  m− 3 and 1.5  ×  1010  m− 3, respectively, which are mainly estimated from the level of quiet-time Ne variations at Swarm altitudes. Using such a method for detecting plasma irregularities, we focus on EPIs with plasma structures scale lengths less than 300  km.|$|R

The values of MVC were recorded for both legs three times on each day and for three subsequent days, while the EMG signals have been recorded twice a day for three subsequent days. The degree of repeatability was investigated using the Fisher test based upon the ANalysis Of VAriance (ANOVA), the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Data collected showed {{a high level of}} repeatability of MVC measurement (normalized SEM from 1. 1 % to 6. 4 % of the mean). MNF and ARV initial values also showed a high level of repeatability (ICC > 70 % for all muscles and legs except right VMO). At 50 % MVC level no relevant pattern of fatigue was observed for the VMO and VL muscles, suggesting that other portions of the quadriceps might have contributed to the generated effort. These observations seem to suggest that in the investigation of muscles belonging to a multi-muscular group at submaximal level, the more selective electrically elicited contractions should be preferred to voluntary contractions.

40|$|The {{study of}} the {{amplitude}} of respiratory muscle mechanomyographic (MMG) signals could be useful in clinical practice as an alternative non-invasive technique to assess respiratory muscle strength. The MMG signal is stochastic in nature, and its amplitude is usually estimated {{by means of the}} average <b>rectified</b> <b>value</b> (ARV) or the root mean square (RMS) of the signal. Both parameters can be used to estimate MMG activity, as they correlate well with muscle force. These estimations are, however, greatly affected by the presence of structured impulsive noise that overlaps in frequency with the MMG signal. In this paper, we present a method for assessing muscle activity based on the Lempel–Ziv algorithm: the Multistate Lempel–Ziv (MLZ) index. The behaviour of the MLZ index was tested with synthesised signals, with various amplitude distributions and degrees of complexity, and with recorded diaphragm MMG signals. We found that this index, like the ARV and RMS parameters, is positively correlated with changes in amplitude of the diaphragm MMG components, but is less affected by components that have non-random behaviour (like structured impulsive noise). Therefore, the MLZ index could provide more information to assess the MMG–force relationship. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of amplitude {{parameters of the}} diaphragm mechanomyographic (MMGdi) signal is a non-invasive technique to assess respiratory muscle effort and to detect and quantify the severity of respiratory muscle weakness.

The behavior of the fSampEn parameter was tested in synthesized mechanomyographic signals, with different ratios between the amplitude of the MCG and clean mechanomyographic components. As an example of application of this technique, the use of fSampEn was explored also in recorded MMGdi signals, with different inspiratory loads.

Methods: Surface electromyography (sEMG) signals were recorded from the sternal bead of SCM and AS muscles bilaterally during submaximal isometric cervical flexion contractions at 25 and 50 % {{of the maximum}} voluntary contraction (MVC). The mean frequency, average <b>rectified</b> <b>value</b> and conduction velocity of the sEMG signal were calculated to quantify myoelectric manifestations of muscle fatigue.

Method: Myoelectric signals were recorded from the sternal head of SCM and the AS muscles as subjects performed sub-maximal isometric cervical flexion contractions at 25 and 50 % {{of the maximum}} voluntary contraction (MVC). The NME was calculated as the ratio between MVC and the corresponding average <b>rectified</b> <b>value</b> of the EMG signal.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{study the effects of}} noise on the {{parameters}} characterizing the size and roughness of contact edges when they are measured by the analysis of top-down SEM images. The applied methodology is based on the modelling of rough contact edges with controlled roughness parameters and the generation of synthesized top down SEM images with several contact edges and a distribution of Critical Dimension (CD) values (CD nonuniformity). The sources of noise can be the shot noise of SEM electron beam (Poisson-type) and the microscope electronics (Gaussian-type). First, we check out the validity of the model and then we apply it to evaluate the effects of noise in synthesized SEM images with smooth and images with rough contact edges. The results show that in all cases, noise lowers CD and correlation length while it increases the rms value. CD variation is increased with noise in images with smooth and identical contacts whereas it remains almost unaltered in images including rough contacts with CD nonuniformity. Furthermore, we find that the application of a noise smoothing filter before image analysis is able to <b>rectify</b> the <b>values</b> of CD (at small filter parameter) and of rms and correlation length (at larger filter parameters), whereas it leads to larger deviations from the true values of CD variation.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} principle of chemistry and biochemistry is that chemical properties and biological activities are related, if not dictated, by chemical structure {{at the molecular}} and polymolecular levels. An important tool in understanding the nature of property/activity dependence on molecular structure is a research protocol known by the acronym QSAR. In Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships, the numerical values of experimental properties or empirically derived parameters are used as independent variables to correlate observed values of biological activities. The fundamental postulate of QSAR analysis is that compounds with similar molecular structures will exhibit similar chemical/biological properties. It is necessary to have a reliable, practical, and rational means by which to assess similarity [...] -thus far this has been impossible. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation molecular QSAR descriptors were used to derive numerical measures of molecular similarity which allowed the postulate to be rigorously tested. This was accomplished by using similarity measures to <b>rectify</b> the experimental <b>values</b> of a toxicological property for a data set of 485 benzene derivatives. This quantitative method for assessing similarity can be carried out using readily available statistical programs, and proved capable of correlating 60. 8...|$|R
