5000|$|Spagyric most {{commonly}} {{refers to a}} plant tincture to which has also been added the ash of the calcined plant. The original rationale behind these special herbal tinctures {{seems to have been}} that an extract using alcohol could not be expected to contain all the medicinal properties from a living plant, and so the ash or mineral component (as a result of the calcination process) of the calcined plant was prepared separately and then added back to 'augment' (increase) the alcoholic tincture. The roots of the word therefore refer first to the extraction or separation process and then to the <b>recombining</b> <b>process.</b> These herbal tinctures are alleged to have superior medicinal properties to simple alcohol tinctures, perhaps due the formation of soap-like compounds from the essential oils and the basic salts contained within the ash. In theory these spagyrics can also optionally include material from fermentation of the plant material and also any aromatic component such as might be obtained through distillation. The final spagyric should be a re-blending of all such extracts into one 'essence.' ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an innovative fabrication of a large-area silicon mold with microstructures. Conventional techniques capable of manufacturing a large size mold pose severe challenges in making microstructures. In contrast, semiconductor process {{is limited in}} its wafer scale. This paper shows {{a new approach to}} achieve a large beyond-wafer-size silicon mold with alignment microstructures using two-direction passive alignment recombining techniques. Anisotropic bulk-micromachining technique, laterally joined of (111) silicon crystal planes, passive-alignment methods are the key to fabricate a large-area silicon mold. The area of each small silicon plate is 2. 9 cm 2. Therefore, four small silicon plates with microstructures were recombined as a large-area square silicon mold. The optical fibers were placed into V-grooves on small silicon plates to make sure of microstructures alignment, minimum tilting and rotation angles between plates during the <b>recombining</b> <b>process.</b> The gap, height difference, and aligning accuracy of microstructures between joined silicon plates were able to achieve 8 µm, 0. 902 µm and 20 µm, respectively. Moreover, the rotation and tilting angles could be lowered to 0. 0622 degree and 0. 002 degree, respectively. Microstructures on the large-area silicon mold are faithfully reproduced by polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). Finally, a 16. 8 cm x 12. 6 cm silicon mold was fabricated using twelve 4. 2 cm x 4. 2 cm silicon plates. It is believed that the novel technique will give an impact and create a highly value-added technology to the precise mold manufacturing...|$|E

40|$|Halloumi {{cheese is}} made in some Middle Eastern {{countries}} from sheep's and goat's milk. It is a hard, unripened white cheese that tastes like immature Cheddar, {{and it has the}} capacity to melt and stretch when heated. The present investigation was undertaken to provide information on the manufacture of Halloumi cheese from fresh cow's milk, to define a process for its manufacture from recombined milk, and to examine the application of ultrafiltration procedures to Halloumi manufacture. The first part of the research programme was conducted {{in order to determine the}} optimal manufacturing conditions for making Halloumi from fresh cow's milk, and to establish appropriate methods of measuring physical properties of the cheese (stretchability, meltability and fat loss). It was found that those manufacturing variables which altered the rate and extent of acid development (percentage of starter, priming, cooking temperature and time) had a marked effect on cheese physical properties. These variables could be altered by the cheesemaker to optimize Halloumi properties. previous reports indicated that Halloumi with desired properties could not be made from recombined milk. The second part of this thesis describes a study of the manufacture of Halloumi from recombined milk (milk made by recombining skim milk powder with anhydrous milkfat). Two main reasons for this were considered, namely, the effect of homogenization treatment used in the <b>recombining</b> <b>process,</b> and the quality of the powder used. It was demonstrated that high homogenization pressures resulted in poor stretchability and meltability of the cheese. In contrast low pressure homogenization gave cheese with satisfactory properties. A model based on the viscoelastic behaviour of polymer systems was described in an attempt to explain how the homogenization treatments influence the stretching behaviour of the cheese network, and it was possible to verify the model in suitable experiments. The preheat temperatures of the skim milk used in the manufacture of skim milk powders were also shown to markedly affect the properties of the cheese. High preheat temperature resulted in reduced stretchability and meltability of the cheese. It was likely that this was due to alteration of the mineral balance and to denaturation of whey proteins. The concentration of total solids prior to spray drying was shown to have no significant effect on the properties of the cheese. In the final part of the investigation, the application of UF to the manufacture of Halloumi cheese was studied using fresh UF milk, and skim milk powder prepared from UF skim milk. When a 5 : 1 UF concentrate of fresh milk was used, some modification in the setting time and cutting device was necessary. The quality of UF Halloumi was very similar to that of the control cheese. In considering the manufacture of Halloumi from recombined milk using UF skim milk powder, the effects on the cheese quality of variations in the ratio of protein to fat, in the solids concentration of the recombined milk, and in the calcium content of the UF skim milk powder were investigated. Best results were obtained when the cheese was manufactured from recombined milk with a low protein-to-fat ratio. The use of low-calcium UF skim milk powder, as opposed to high-calcium powder, resulted in some improvement in the quality of the cheese. Varying the concentration of the recombined milk solids had no significant effect on the cheese properties. The present investigation has demonstrated that good quality Halloumi cheese having the desirable typical stretchability and meltability can be made not only from fresh cow's milk, but also from recombined and UF milks provided that appropriate materials and manufacturing procedures are used...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extensive}} rheology {{study of the}} wormlike micelle system lecithin-water-cyclohexane. In this system the micelles are really wormlike, meaning {{that there are no}} signs of micellar branching, as it has previously been demonstrated by NMR self-diffusion experiments (Angelico et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 1998, 81, 2823). Wormlike micelles break and <b>recombine,</b> <b>processes</b> that are important for the stress relaxation. When branching is highly unfavorable, micelle recombination reactions only involve micelle ends, the concentration of which are very low when the micelles are very long. Hence, the break and recombination kinetics is very slow for true wormlike micelles. In the present system, the stress relaxation times are of the order of an hour. This is about three to four orders of magnitude longer than what commonly is observed in systems claimed to contain wormlike micelles. We conclude that systems with true wormlike micelles are very rare. An exponential stress relaxation is observed except at lower concentrations, where the micellar breaking time appears to exceed the reptation time. Because of the slow dynamics, the linear elastic modulus can be obtained from small rapid shear deformations, for which the system obeys Hooke’s law. Larger deformations result in a fracture of the micellar network at a critical strain gamma*~FI- 1, where FI is the micelle volume fraction. For gamma<gamma* we may still obtain fracture, although with a lag time, tau*, that decreases with increasing gamma, and vanishes when gamma=gamma*. Extrapolating gamma* to zero deformation we obtain the estimate ≈ 250 s at the highest concentration FI= 0. 29. This time we interpret as equilibrium micellar breaking time for the system at rest.

40|$|Abstract- Time reversal, or phase-conjugation, refocuses energy {{back to a}} probe source {{location}} {{despite the}} complexity of the propagation channel. A probe source pulse is transmitted and a complicated multipath signal is measured by an array of source/receiver elements. The signal is time reversed and retransmitted into the ocean. The time-reversal <b>process</b> <b>recombines</b> this temporal multipath at the original probe source range and depth. The ability of time reversal to reduce dispersion and its simplicity of implementation makes it ideal for underwater acoustic communications, which must mitigate the inter-symbol interference caused by the time-varying multipath dispersion.

40|$|Morphological {{openings}} and closings {{are useful}} for the smoothing of grayscale images. However, their use for image noise reduction is limited by their tendency to remove important, thin features from an image along with the noise. This paper is a description and analysis of a new morphological image cleaning algorithm (MIC) that preserves thin features while removing noise. MIC is useful for grayscale images corrupted by dense, low-amplitude, random or patterned noise. Such noise is typical of scanned or still-video images. MIC differs from previous morphological noise filters in that it manipulates residual images – {{the differences between the}} original image and morphologically smoothed versions. It calculates residuals on a number of different scales via a morphological size distribution. It discards regions in the various residuals that it judges to contain noise. MIC creates a cleaned image by <b>recombining</b> the <b>processed</b> residual images with a smoothed version. This paper describes the MIC algorithm in detail, discusses the effects of parametric variations, presents the results of a noise analysis and shows a number of examples of its use, including the removal of scanner noise.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [133]- 138). Morphological {{filters are}} well known for their potential in image noise reduction. Peters recently proposed an attractive morphological image cleaning (MIC) algorithm that preserves thin features while removing noise by discarding regions in a sequence of residual images (the differences between the original image and morphologically smoothed versions) that it judges to contain noise and <b>recombining</b> the <b>processed</b> smooth residuals to form a cleaned image. The MIC algorithm proves to be effective on dense, low-amplitude, random or patterned noise. However, the MIC algorithm suffers from high computational cost and degraded performance for high-amplitude noise. This thesis presents a novel denoising method, wavelet-based morphological image cleaning (WMIC) algorithm, which is effective for images corrupted by noise of various amplitudes. In addition, the computational complexity of the new algorithm is much lower than Peters? MIC algorithm. These improvements are achieved by exploiting the dual spatial and frequency localization property of wavelets. Experimental results show that for low-amplitude noise, the WMIC algorithm is competitive with the median filter in removing impulse noise and the Wiener filter in suppressing continuous noise; for high-amplitude noise (especially mixed noise), the WMIC algorithm surpasses the median filter and the Wiener filter in overall performance. In this thesis, we first introduce mathematical morphology and previous morphology-based work in image noise reduction {{with an emphasis on}} Peters? MIC algorithm. After the drawbacks of Peter? MIC algorithm are discussed, we explore a wavelet domain peer. The basic theorem of wavelet transform follows. Then we propose the WMIC algorithm and give {{a detailed description of the}} implementation. Experimental results and discussions are presented at the end. M. S. (Master of Science...|$|R
