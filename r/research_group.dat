40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse how the {{characteristics}} of academic <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> affect their interactions with firms. Using data from a survey conducted in Brazilian <b>research</b> <b>groups,</b> an empirical model was estimated to evaluate how the characteristics of the <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> impact their interactions with firms. Main results show that <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> with higher academic performance, larger <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> and groups affiliated with larger departments tend to present higher numbers of interactions. Furthermore, engineering and agricultural sciences <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> interact more. Given these findings, the main contribution of the paper is that it furthers understanding of the factors that shape university–industry linkages and how characteristics of <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> affect interaction...|$|R

Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health <b>research</b> <b>group,</b> found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from the smog, including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the <b>research</b> <b>group</b> said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like the smog had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E

The Soviet Union responded positively to the counterproposal and the <b>research</b> <b>group</b> convened on 11 May 1960. The Soviet Union also offered to keep an underground ban out of the treaty under negotiation.

The general framework points to a closer relationship between universities and firms, showed in relationships based in scientific research and technology transference, but results constrained to private and state-owned enterprises suggest that sophisticated interactions should be taking inter-institutions.

Pharmaceutical Sciences panel members published more diversely than the corresponding <b>research</b> <b>groups,</b> whereas, the Biology <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> published more diversely than the panel. Numbers of publications in the same journals vary over a large scale. A different range of coverage was found for different research groups; there is also a significant difference between maximum and minimum coverage based on discipline. Future research will focus on similarity testing, and a comparison with other disciplines...|$|R
