50|$|Gift Aid allows {{individuals}} who are subject to UK income tax to complete a simple, short declaration {{that they are a}} UK taxpayer. Any cash donations that the taxpayer makes to the charity after making a declaration are treated as being made after deduction of income tax at the basic rate (20% in 2011), and the charity can reclaim the basic rate income tax paid on the gift from HMRC. For a basic-rate taxpayer, this adds approximately 25% to the value of any gift made under Gift Aid. Higher-rate taxpayers can claim income tax relief, above and beyond the amount claimed directly by the charities. The rate of the relief for higher-rate taxpayers in 2011 is usually 20%, the difference between the basic rate (20%) and the higher rate (40%) of income tax, although <b>recipients</b> <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> income (taxed at 10% and 32.5%) can achieve a higher rate of tax relief (22.5%).|$|R

40|$|The French {{income tax}} {{structure}} {{is based on}} the concept of an integrated tax system. The system utilizes a tax credit at the shareholder level to eliminate or mitigate the double taxation that would otherwise apply to a dividend. The tax credit is automatically available to a French shareholder receiving a dividend from a French corporation. The "precompte mobilier " (or precompte) is a mechanism that provides for the integration of the tax credit to the shareholder with the taxes paid by the corporation. The precompte is a tax paid by the corporation at the time <b>of</b> a <b>dividend</b> distribution that is equal to the difference between a tax based on the regular corporation tax rate applied to the amount <b>of</b> the declared <b>dividend</b> and taxes previously paid by the corporation on the income being distributed. In addition, if a corporation pays a dividend from earnings that have been retained for more than five years, the corporation loses the benefit of any taxes previously paid in the computation of the precompte. The issue is whether a tax that is assessed on a corporation based on dividends distributed, such as the French precompte tax, should be recorded as an increase in income tax expense or considered to be in effect a withholding of tax for the <b>recipient</b> <b>of</b> the <b>dividend</b> and recorded in equity as part <b>of</b> the <b>dividend</b> paid to shareholders...|$|R

The purpose of this thesis is to explain the dividend phenomena using a reputation model {{in the world of}} imperfect information. In a two-period version of the model, the rationale <b>of</b> paying <b>dividends</b> and smoothing is analyzed. However, the reputation effect and the time pattern <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> cannot be easily accommodated. We extend the model into a three-period model in which the behavior <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> through time, and the market response on the change in dividends are analyzed. The reputation effect is incorporated such that the reliability of signalling improves with the passage of time. ^ New empirical results which support the reputation model are presented. The market response to the initial dividend announcement is analyzed using all the cases <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> initiation recorded on the CRSP daily stock files from July 2, 1962, to December 31, 1987. For firms which announce dividends during their first year on a major exchange, the abnormal return on the announcement date <b>of</b> initial <b>dividends</b> is not significant. Also, the change in the magnitude of the market response to the change in dividends through time is analyzed. We group the announcements <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> increases according to the number of years passed after the initiation <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The market 2 ̆ 7 s response to unexpected dividend increases in earlier periods is smaller than the case <b>of</b> unexpected <b>dividend</b> increases in later periods. ^ The reputation model adds a new perspective to the analysis of dividends: the time aspect <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> that is, the effect of a consistent stream <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments on the value of a firm.

40|$|More {{recently}} {{researchers have}} turned to analyze how the tax structure, rather than the overall tax level, affects economic performance. For instance, several papers have investigated how taxation on corporate and individual (labor) income influences growth. Taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> income may also influence growth via its impact on investments and firm behavior. Within the academic community there is conflicting views about the impact taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> has on firm behavior and, hence, on economic performance. According to the "traditional view", taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> is distortionary and increases the cost of equity. According to the "new view", taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> does not influence the marginal cost of capital and consequently has no impact on investment decisions. To our knowledge, this paper is the first study to explore how tax rates on dividends affect economic growth, by using panel data from 1990 till 2008 for 18 European countries.

40|$|In this article, {{we propose}} a {{generalized}} friction model {{to test the}} information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> The proposed model resolves the problem <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> stickiness in the time-series data and provides a more reliable estimate for the relation between unexpected changes in dividends and earnings. Unlike previous studies, we specifically consider the dynamic partial adjustment <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> in estimating the expected dividend component. Our results contain several important findings. First, the results support the contention that dividend changes reflect both expected and unexpected permanent earnings changes. Since Miller and Modigliani (1961) proposed the information hypothesis <b>of</b> <b>dividends,</b> financial {{researchers have sought to}} answer questions concerning whether dividends convey information and, if they do, what types of information are contained in dividends. The results in this study show that dividends are strongly related to a firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings estimates. Our results also show that dividend changes signal changes in management 2 ̆ 7 s views of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s future earnings prospects. The abnormal (unexpected) dividend, which is the difference between the current dividend and the conditional expectation <b>of</b> the current <b>dividend,</b> has on average a significant positive relation with the unexpected changes in the firm 2 ̆ 7 s permanent earnings. Second, there is evidence that the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling depends on firm-specific characteristics. Consistent with the existing dividend signaling theory, the strength <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> signaling is negatively related to the firm 2 ̆ 7 s systematic risk, external equity financing, and size and positively related to net investments and the degree <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> smoothing. Third, our results suggest that the generalized friction model is a more suitable framework for examining the information content <b>of</b> <b>dividends.</b> Watts (1973) took an approach similar to this study to examine the information effect <b>of</b> <b>dividends...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the extent to which UK equity prices reflect shareholder level taxation on dividends (dividend tax capitalisation).

Design/methodology/approach – Using a sample of UK firm year ends from 1991 to 2007 archival accounting and share price data are used to test for the presence or otherwise <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> tax capitalisation. Findings – The paper finds evidence of equity values reflecting shareholder level dividend taxation. In particular, a significant reduction in the valuation of retained earnings, a measure <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> paying potential, is observed around the July 1997 abolition of the repayment <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> tax credits to tax exempt shareholders. This suggests a link between shareholder level taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> and firms’ cost of capital. Research limitations/implications – The analysis focuses on share prices and is therefore subject to an underlying assumption of shareholders’ understanding tax and other potential relevant information. Practical implications – The taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> is an important issue because of the potential for it to influence firms’ cost of capital and therefore investment decisions. Further, non-tax costs may be incurred to the extent that attempts are made to mitigate any “adverse” tax effects. Social implications – The results indicate that taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> and share prices are associated and therefore also indirectly firms’ cost of capital. This linkage has implications for investment appraisal and the allocation of capital between competing demands.

The taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> is an important issue because of the potential for it to influence firms? cost of capital and therefore investment decisions. Further, non-tax costs may be incurred to the extent that attempts are made to mitigate any ?adverse? tax effects. Social implications ? The results indicate that taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> and share prices are associated and therefore also indirectly firms? cost of capital. This linkage has implications for investment appraisal and the allocation of capital between competing demands. Originality/value ? In using an asset valuation approach the limitations of alternate methods of examining shareholder level taxation <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> are avoided, e. g. analysis <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> drop <b>of</b> ratios. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} the effect <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> tax {{changes on the}} share prices and corporate policies of Malaysian REITs. Event study results show that dividend tax cut announcements provide positive abnormal returns. Based on cross-sectional regression, the abnormal returns {{are found to be}} larger for REITs with a higher retail ownership. The implementation <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> tax cuts also increases dividend payout and reduce investment activities. These results partly support the traditional view <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> taxation which posits that tax reform could affect economic efficiency and resource allocation in an econom...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a classical surplus process modified by the payment <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> when the insurer’s surplus exceeds a threshold. We use a probabilistic argument to obtain general expressions for the expected present value <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments, and show how these expressions {{can be applied}} for certain individual claim amount distributions. We then consider the question of maximising the expected present value <b>of</b> <b>dividend</b> payments subject to a constraint on the insurer’s ruin probability. Key words: Dividends, ruin probability, time of ruin, severity of ruin. 1 Introduction and notation In this paper we {{consider a}} classical surplus process modified by the payment <b>of</b> <b>dividends</b> from the premium income when the surplus level is above a certain value, which we {{refer to as the}} threshold. We therefore start by introducing some results and notation for the classica...|$|R
