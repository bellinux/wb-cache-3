On {{the basis of the}} established formula of axial rolling force, the formula of axial <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> is derived by using the moving volume theory of energy method. The influence of processing parameters on the axial <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> is investigated. It is found that the axial <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> increases with the increase of the outer diameter of ring, and the axial <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> decreases with the increase of the inside diameter of ring. The greater the feed in axial direction, the greater the axial <b>rolling</b> <b>torque.</b> The correctness of the formula is verified by calculating actual examples...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: To {{estimate}} {{the effect of}} roller deformation on the workpiece during the rolling process of H-beams, {{it is essential to}} consider the force exerted on the rollers and the deformation thereof. For this purpose, a three-dimension thermo-mechanical coupling model has been built with the finite element analytical package ABAQUS to simulate the hot rolling process of H-beams. In particular, the simulation is conducted under the assumption that the rollers are elastic and <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> imposed unilaterally, which agrees with the practical rolling conditions. Noting the results of FEM simulation, the metal flow and temperature distribution have been obtained. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed simulation, comparisons of the roller contact reaction and temperature between the simulated and measured values have been made.

The analysis is validated by comparison to the experimental results in a previously published work. The analytical results have shown that, apart from the problems of slip and buckling of billet, there are some shortcomings involved in this method. Compared to conventional rolling with all driven stands, the roll load for idle vertical stands and the <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> for horizontal stands are almost doubled. The billet is severely stressed within the roll-bite of idle vertical stands and the overall rolling power has increased by one third of that for conventional rolling. These shortcomings impair the feasibility of industrial application of idle vertical stand rolling method...|$|E

Realistic wing-body morphologies and kinematics are adopted in the numerical simulations. The computed results show 3 D mechanisms of vortical flow structures in hawkmoth-like hovering. A horseshoe-shaped primary vortex is observed to wrap around each wing during the early down- and upstroke; the horseshoe-shaped vortex subsequently grows into a doughnut-shaped vortex ring with an intense jet-flow present in its core, forming a downwash. The doughnut-shaped vortex rings of the wing pair eventually break up into two circular vortex rings as they propagate downstream in the wake. The aerodynamic yawing and <b>rolling</b> <b>torques</b> are canceled out due to the symmetric wing kinematics even though the aerodynamic pitching torque shows significant variation with time.

To stabilize the motor torque the electric drive system with {{the properties of the}} rolling motor torque supply may also be used. An alternate option may include torque stabilization by to the effect on speed of the previous, further or controlled mill stand. The tension control accuracy depends on how exact the unhindered <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> is determined. Nevertheless, a change in tension due to this factor may result in improving gauge accuracy in some systems. Using the model of the continuous rolling mill, the paper considers the force interaction between the stand electric drives for different technological conditions of rolling.

The finished studies prove that size alignment is provided with the tension control system affecting speed of the further stands. The paper verifies that the characteristics of the rolling mill including aligning ability depend on the rolling speed.

This study derives {{the stress}} {{field of the}} bond rolling of {{unbounded}} sandwich sheet with outer soft and inner hard layers at the roll gap considering Coulomb friction between the roll and the sandwich, and Coulomb friction at the interface of the unbounded region. Due to the sandwich sheet unbounded before rolling, three-layer sheets are not bonded firmly. The neutral point between the roll and the sandwich sheet, the rolling pressure distribution along contact interface between the roll and sandwich sheet, the horizontal stress of whole sandwich sheet, the horizontal stresses in the component layers of sandwich, the shear stress at the interface of sandwich sheet, the rolling force, and <b>rolling</b> <b>torque,</b> etc. are effectively calculated via this model. Furthermore, it is of great important to obtain the bonding point at the interface and the thickness ratio of sandwich sheet {{at the exit from}} this study.

40|$|The {{effect of}} interstand tension, {{resulting}} from the increase in relative rolling velocity in successive stands of continuous rolling with a round–oval–round sequence, on the roll load, <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> and workpiece deformation has been investigated. For this purpose, a simplified analytical approach has been formulated and validated by comparison with available experimental results. Based on this approach, a limiting value was determined for {{the increase in the}} ratio of relative rolling velocity between stands. When this limiting value is reached, the state of stress in the workpiece within the roll gap changes to a uniaxial state of stress that can lead to the loss of the ability of the work rolls to grip the workpiece and consequently these changes might make the rolling process unstable. The results have also shown that the roll load decreases with increasing interstand tension while the torque increases with an increase in back tension and decreases with an increase in front tension. The reduction in the outgoing maximum width of the workpiece as a result of interstand tension is linearly related to the increase in the ratio of relative rolling velocity between stands...|$|E

40|$|Numerical {{estimation}} of <b>rolling</b> load and <b>torque</b> often showed large discrepancies {{when compared with}} experimental values. This was attributed to difficulty in estimating the mean rolling temperature from the available data. This work is thus directed at obtaining a good estimate for the mean rolling temperature which can effectively be used for load and torque estimates. Hot flat rolling stimulation by use of the Bland and Ford's cold rolling (HRBF) theory confirmed the reverse sandwich effect in selected carbon steels at low strain rates. In this work, the effect of pass reduction on rolling temperature distribution, yield stress and rolling load were studied for AISI Type 316 stainless steel (HSCSS 316). For this new simulation, at low and high strain rates, {{results showed that the}} ratio of experimental to calculated <b>rolling</b> load and <b>torque</b> were higher at lower reduction than at higher reduction.

40|$|Abstract. A new {{analytical}} model for cold and hot bond rolling of clad sheet unbounded before rolling is derived {{to investigate the}} stress field of the clad sheet at the roll gap by using the direct formulation without the Runge Kutta numerical method. Constant shear friction between the rolls and the clad sheet is assumed. Due to the clad sheet unbounded before rolling, double-layer sheets are not bonded {{at the entrance of}} the roll gap. Thus the stress field of the roll gap for this model is different from that for clad sheet bonded firmly before rolling. In this study, the neutral point between the rolls and the clad sheet, the rolling pressure distribution along the contact interface between the rolls and the clad sheet, the horizontal stresses in the component layers of the clad sheet, the rolling force, and the <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> etc., can be easily and rapidly calculated by using the developed {{analytical model}}.

40|$|In {{the most}} recent years the {{asymmetric}} rolling (AR) attracts attention of researchers and technologists. This process can improve some technological parameters (e. g. modification of <b>rolling</b> <b>torque</b> and load, power requirements, etc.) {{as well as provide}} the possibility of grain refinement in a relatively inexpensive way. Most of the reports concerning microstructural changes produced by AR refer to high deformations imposed in highly asymmetric conditions. However, such rolling conditions are difficult to control, so there are no prospects to their quick industrial implementation. The present paper refers to relatively low deformation and low asymmetry rate, that is much more interesting for the industry. It was shown that bending of the rolled band (important disadvantage of the AR technology) can be controlled by adjusting of the amount of deformation and asymmetry. It was also shown that ca. 30 % reduction in thickness during cold rolling, together with a relatively low asymmetry, reduces significantly the grain size and produces a more fragmented microstructure inside grains of the polycrystalline copper comparing to the symmetric rolling (SR). The material hardness after AR is higher than after the SR. Moreover, the crystallographic texture asymmetry, expressed by its rotation around the transverse direction, is observed in the AR material...|$|E
40|$|The rolling {{friction}} of adhesive microspheres {{is an important}} quantity as it determines the strength and stability of larger aggregates. Current models predict rolling forces that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude smaller than observed experimentally. Starting from the well-known Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) contact description, we derive an analytical theory for the {{rolling friction}} based {{on the concept of}} adhesion hysteresis, e. g. a difference in apparent surface energies for opening/closing cracks. We show how adhesion hysteresis causes the pressure distribution within the contact to become asymmetrical, leading to an opposing torque. Analytical expressions are derived relating the size of the hysteresis, the <b>rolling</b> <b>torque,</b> and the rolling displacement, ξ. We confirm the existence of a critical rolling displacement for the onset of rolling, the size of which is set by the amount of adhesion hysteresis {{and the size of the}} contact area. We demonstrate how the developed theory is able to explain the large rolling forces and particle-size dependence observed experimentally. Good agreement with experimental results is achieved for adhesion hysteresis values of (Δγ/γ) sime 3 for polystyrene, and (Δγ/γ) sime 0. 5 for silicates, at crack propagation rates of 0. 1 µm s− 1 and 1 - 10 µm s− 1, respectively...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} {{correctly}} design {{the process of}} bar rolling in grooves it is required that several limitations affecting the rolling process be considered. When developing a technology, energy and force parameters, among others, are needed {{to be taken into}} account. Therefore, it is purposeful to examine variations in the energy and force parameters during the rolling of bars. Design/methodology/approach: Using FEM-based computer programs for solving the problems of the theory of plasticity enables determining the energy and force parameters in complex plastic working processes and also accounting for a number of process specificities, which are not provided for by the empirical formula.

40|$|International audienceLubrication {{is a key}} {{parameter}} {{for improving}} the finishing mill process in hot rolling. The lubrication changes the contact interface between the work rolls and the hot strip. The lubrication can reduce the rolling force, the <b>rolling</b> <b>torque,</b> the energy consumption, the work rolls consumption and the work rolls wear. Lubrication is also a lever to optimize finishing mill capability. That is why understanding the lubrication effect is important. A way to study the lubrication is thanks {{to the analysis of}} the friction coefficient between the work rolls and the strip, which characterizes the contact at the interface. The lubrication reduces the friction coefficient which has an impact on the mass flow disturbing the thickness reduction and the interstand strip tension. The understanding of the lubrication effect goes through a design of a model that relies on lubrication and friction. ArcerlorMittal R&D performed industrial lubrication trials in the pilot plant’s finishing mill. For this purpose, R&D designed a dedicated mobile dosing unit (oil in water concentration control and portable system). R&D studied the lubrication behavior based on data from industrial trials and developed a dynamical model. The friction variation is mainly linked to the oil in water concentration, the lubrication plate out, the rolling speed, the thickness reduction.
