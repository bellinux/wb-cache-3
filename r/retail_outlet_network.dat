From French Data obtained from 1999 to 2004, our results show that non-conformism increases turnover and decreases profitability, but only up to certain thresholds. This result allows us to measure the importance of this variable for the determination of the optimum mix between franchise and <b>retail</b> chain. <b>Retail</b> <b>outlet</b> <b>networks</b> may favor or not conformism through a volume or profitability objective, according to the sought performance indicator...|$|R

40|$|Methodical {{approaches}} to selecting strategic areas {{of managing the}} future location of franchise <b>retail</b> <b>network</b> <b>outlets</b> are presented. The main stages {{in the assessment of}} strategic areas of managing the future location of franchise <b>retail</b> <b>network</b> <b>outlets</b> have been determined and the evaluation criteria have been suggested. Since such selection requires consideration of a variety of indicators and directions of the assessment, the author proposes a scale of evaluation, which allows generalizing and organizing the research data and calculations of the previous stages of the analysis. The most important criteria and sequence of the selection of the potential franchisees for the franchise retail network have been identified, the technique for their evaluation has been proposed. The use of the suggested methodological approaches will allow the franchiser making sound decisions on the selection of potential target markets, minimizing expenditures of time and efforts on the selection of franchisees and hence optimizing the process of development of the franchise retail network, which will contribute to the formation of its structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{paper is}} devoted to {{economic}} and mathematical simulation of an autonomous <b>network</b> of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> at a local market. The question of simulation of redistribution precesses in the network is discussed. Two interconnected and complemented economic -mathematical models are suggested. These models describe the evolution precesses of the sale conditions in the network. They are constructed {{on the basis of}} the price demand and the system state functions. The mathematical models are described by a dynamic system of partial differential equations. The main attention is given to mathematical simulation of the redistribution process of consumer demand through <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> in the <b>network</b> under fluctuations of prices. The numerical realization of the models is discussed. Computer simulations show that the proposed models can adequately reflect some real processes of the sales redistribution in the network...|$|R

40|$|It is {{important}} for modern businesses to search the ways for continuous improvement in performance of their supply chains. The effective coordination and integrated decision making across the supply chain enhances the performance among its various partners in a multi stage network. The partners considered in this paper are product suppliers, processing points (PP), distribution centres (DC) and <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> (RO). The <b>network</b> addresses an uncertain environment threatened by different sources in order to captivate the real world conditions. The uncertain demand of deteriorating products and its dependent costs develop uncertainties in the environment. On the other hand, suppliers and processing points have restricted capacities for the retail outlets’ order amount happened in each period. A bi-objective non-linear fuzzy mathematical model is developed in which the uncertainties are represented by the fuzzy set theory. The proposed model shows cost minimization and best supplier selection coordination under the conditions of capacity constraints, uncertain parameters and product’s deteriorating nature. The fish and fish products give good examples for the proposed model. To solve, the model is converted into crisp form and solved {{with the help of}} fuzzy goal programming...|$|R

40|$|We {{research}} the management approach that quantitatively combines {{decisions that affect}} different planning horizons [...] namely, the strategic and operational ones [...] and simultaneously derive the optimal values of these decisions. The system we investigate comprises <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers in an infinite-horizon setting. Both <b>retail</b> <b>outlets</b> and customers are located on a finite homogenous line segment. The total demand posed by customers is normally distributed with known mean and variance. To optimally design and operate such a system, we need to determine the optimal values {{of the number of}} <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the location of each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet,</b> and the replenishment inventory levels maintained at each <b>retail</b> <b>outlet.</b> We analyze the system from an expected cost point of view, considering the fixed costs of operating the <b>retail</b> <b>outlets,</b> the expected holding and shortage costs, and the expected delivery costs. We show that all decisions can be represented {{as a function of the}} number of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> Moreover, we show that the system's expected cost function is quasi-convex in the number of <b>retail</b> <b>outlets.</b> We compare our model to a model that does not integrate these decisions at once. We show the advantage of our approach on both the solution and objective spaces. We propose an exact quantification of this advantage in terms of the cost and problem parameters. In addition, we point out several managerial insights. location-inventory model, implicit function theorem, risk pooling, infinite-horizon stochastic inventory, subadditive function, quasi-convex...|$|R
