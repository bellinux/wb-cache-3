5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} {{is generated by}} electrical currents in the planet's outer core, which is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Volcanic eruptions on Jupiter's moon Io eject large amounts of sulfur dioxide gas into space, forming a large torus around the planet. Jupiter's magnetic field forces the torus to <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> the same angular velocity and direction as the planet. The torus in turn loads the magnetic field with plasma, in the process stretching it into a pancake-like structure called a magnetodisk. In effect, Jupiter's magnetosphere is shaped by Io's plasma and its own rotation, {{rather than by the}} solar wind like Earth's magnetosphere. Strong currents in the magnetosphere generate permanent aurorae around the planet's poles and intense variable radio emissions, which means that Jupiter {{can be thought of as}} a very weak radio pulsar. Jupiter's aurorae have been observed in almost all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including infrared, visible, ultraviolet and soft X-rays.|$|E
5|$|The turrets {{were placed}} on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, Caesar and Illustrious, had {{circular}} barbettes. The BII mountings {{in the first six}} ships allowed all-around loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from the magazines, as the ammunition hoists did not <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> the turret. Caesar and Illustrious, with their circular barbettes, had BIII mountings with rotating hoists, and these allowed all-around loading from the magazines. Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from 5degrees to 13.5degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During World War I, four of the Majestics were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight s. A further two turrets from Illustrious were later emplaced as coastal guns on the Tyne.|$|E

25|$|The aurorae of Saturn {{are highly}} variable. Their {{location}} and brightness strongly {{depends on the}} Solar wind pressure: the aurorae become brighter and move closer to the poles when the Solar wind pressure increases. The bright auroral features are observed to <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> the angular speed of 60–75% that of Saturn. From time to time bright features appear in the dawn sector of the main oval or inside it. The average total power emitted by the aurorae is about 50GW in the far ultraviolet (80–170nm) and 150–300GW in the near-infrared (3–4μm—H3+ emissions) parts of the spectrum.|$|E
500|$|Odd {{structures}} {{known as}} polar vortices lie within the cold polar collars. They are giant hurricane-like storms four {{times larger than}} their terrestrial analogs. Each vortex has two [...] "eyes"—the centres of rotation, which are connected by distinct S-shaped cloud structures. Such double eyed structures are also called polar dipoles. Vortices <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> the period of about 3 days {{in the direction of}} general super-rotation of the atmosphere. The linear wind speeds are 35–50m/s near their outer edges and zero at the poles. The temperature at the cloud-tops in the each polar vortex is much higher than in the nearby polar collars reaching 250K (−23°C). The conventional interpretation of the polar vortices is that they are anticyclones with downwelling in the centre and upwelling in the cold polar collars. This type of circulation resembles a winter polar anticyclonic vortex on Earth, especially the one found over Antarctica. The observations in the various infrared atmospheric windows indicate that the anticyclonic circulation observed near the poles penetrates as deep as to 50km altitude, i.e. {{to the base of the}} clouds. The polar upper troposphere and mesosphere are extremely dynamic; large bright clouds may appear and disappear over the space of a few hours. One such event was observed by Venus Express between 9 and 13 January 2007, when the south polar region became brighter by 30%. This event was probably caused by an injection of sulfur dioxide into the mesosphere, which then condensed forming a bright haze. The two eyes in the vortices have yet to be explained.|$|E

500|$|Steam devils are {{vortices}} typically about 50 to 200 metres in diameter, essentially vertical, {{and up to}} 500 metres high. [...] The general {{shape is}} like a small waterspout but {{they should not be}} considered related. [...] Steam devils <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> a cyclonic direction of motion, but not very fast or powerfully, usually just a few rotations per minute, and sometimes apparently not at all. [...] There is usually a well-defined inner part of the rotating column of steam and a more ragged outer part from which clumps of steam often detach. [...] Rather smaller steam devils can form over small lakes, especially the warm water in the hot springs of geyser basins. [...] In these cases typical dimensions are a metre or so diameter, but can vary from less than 0.1 to 2 metres, and a height of 2 to 30 metres with a somewhat faster rotation of 60 rpm or so. [...] The central core of the steam devil can be clear, in the same sense that the centre of a dust devil is clear of dust. [...] The core is around 10% of the width of the rotating column. [...] The sky above the steam devils may be clear, or there may be cumulus clouds present. [...] In some cases the steam devils may rise directly into the cumulus, in these cases the cumulus may actually be caused by the steam devils - see below. [...] Steam devils are a rare and short-lived phenomenon, typically surviving no more than three or four minutes, and the smaller ones over hot springs dissipating in a matter of seconds.Bluestein, p.151Holle (2007), p.9Lyons & Pease, pp.236-237Zurn-Birkhimer et al., p.2431 ...|$|E

2500|$|In step 2, {{since there}} is no current observed, one might {{conclude}} that the magnetic field did not <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> the rotating magnet. (Whether it does or does not effectively or relatively, the Lorentz force is zero since v is zero relative to the laboratory frame. So there is no current measuring from laboratory frame.) The use of the Lorentz equation to explain this paradox has led to a debate in the literature {{as to whether or not}} a magnetic field rotates with a magnet. Since the force on charges expressed by the Lorentz equation depends upon the relative motion of the magnetic field (i.e. the laboratory frame) to the conductor where the EMF is located it was speculated that in the case when the magnet rotates with the disk but a voltage still develops, the magnetic field (i.e. the laboratory frame) must therefore not <b>rotate</b> <b>with</b> the magnetic material (of course since it is the laboratory frame), while the effective definition of magnetic field frame or the [...] "effective/relative rotation of the field" [...] turns with no relative motion with respect to the conductive disk.|$|E
