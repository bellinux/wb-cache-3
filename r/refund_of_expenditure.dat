40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the impact on the {{existing}} public private mix of the reforms undertaken in the French health care system in the past twenty years. As for financing, the system has slowly moved closer to the Beveridge model, with greater emphasis on general levy taxes in order to enhance universality and equity. For hospital funding, the reforms have fostered the development of a fairer competition between the public and private sectors by slowly aligning the private sector financing rules on those prevailing for public hospitals, in particular closed budgets and eventually, prospective payment schemes. In ambulatory care, patient driven competition between primary and secondary services has shown its limits and reforms are slowly changing the existing competitive relationships between these providers. But more structural reforms are needed to alter the incentives towards overuse in ambulatory care, particularly for drugs. Finally, the macroeconomic regulation which started in the early 90 s has taken the form of global caps, allowing a shift from an ex-post <b>refunding</b> <b>of</b> <b>expenditure</b> to an ex-ante target rate of increase, but it has met with a mitigated success. The high deficit estimate for 2003 will inevitably bring health care cost containment issues to the fore. 1 We would like to thank Valérie Paris for a thorough reading of earlier versions of this paper.

50|$|Prior to 1973, unoccupied {{properties}} {{were entitled}} to a full <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the rates paid. Effective from 1973, vacant properties could only enjoy a 50% <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the rates. In late 1973, vacancy refund for domestic properties was abolished. Refund for non-domestic vacant properties was eventually removed on 1 July 1995. Thereafter, <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> rates is not allowed for vacant properties unless they are vacated {{as a result of}} a Government initiated court order. Refunds are also allowed for vacant open land, providing it is not used for the parking of motor vehicles.|$|R

50|$|In April 1951, the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut {{ruled that}} Kellems was {{entitled}} to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> income taxes assessed against her employees for which the government had been overpaid (that is, the tax had been collected from both the employees and Kellems). The Court also ruled that Kellems and her co-plaintiff David Kellems were not entitled to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> penalties they had paid on account of their refusal to withhold taxes, as the Kellems were unable to show that their refusal was with reasonable cause under the law. For another period in question, a jury did find that Kellems conduct was not willful, {{and that she was}} therefore entitled to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> penalty she had paid.|$|R

50|$|The Beverage Container Act 1975 (SA) {{required}} a mandatory deposit of 5 cents per bottle, {{which would be}} refunded when they were returned; refillable bottles were exempt from this deposit. A later amendment, the Beverage Container Act Amendment Act 1986 (SA) subjected non-refillable bottles to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> 15 cents and refillable bottles to a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> 4 cents. Further more, the refund for non-refillable bottles was to be implemented by retailers, instead of a collection depot.|$|R
50|$|In general, this payment {{meant that}} the {{recipients}} of the dividend were considered to have already paid basic rate tax on the dividend income. Non-taxpayers, such as pension funds, who would not otherwise have paid income tax on the dividend income, became entitled to claim a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> the ACT amount, or after 1993 a lesser amount. The <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> ACT for non-taxpayers was scrapped in 1997, but in 1999 ACT was itself scrapped, effectively making dividend income of non-taxpayers tax-free again.|$|R

5000|$|Rather than selling {{cigarettes}} nationally, several NPMs instead concentrated {{their sales}} {{in just a}} few states. Because the originally enacted escrow statute refunded escrow funds to the extent those funds exceeded each state's [...] "allocable share" [...] of the national MSA payment, NPMs were able to obtain <b>refunds</b> <b>of</b> most of the monies they had paid into a state's escrow fund. To illustrate, if an NPM only sold cigarettes in Kansas in 2006, the Kansas escrow statute would require that NPM to pay into the Kansas escrow fund $.0167539 for each cigarette the NPM sold in that state. Pursuant to the refund provision in the originally enacted Kansas escrow statute, however, the NPM could obtain a <b>refund</b> <b>of</b> all but [...]8336712% of those payments.|$|R
