50|$|<b>Round</b> <b>nose</b> <b>pliers,</b> rosary pliers or snub-nose pliers are a {{specialized}} plier characterized by their rounded, tapering jaws and {{most commonly used}} for creating loops in pieces of wire by electricians and jewellers. Some <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> have insulated handles for safe electrical work, a spring-fitted joint and comfortable grips on the handles.|$|E
50|$|Four {{tools are}} {{essential}} {{and several other}} tools are useful {{in the construction of}} wire wrapped jewelry. The basic tools are a flush cutter, <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> <b>pliers,</b> flat nose pliers and chain nose or bent chain nose pliers. A flush cutter is a special type of cutter that leaves one end of the cut wire flush or flat, while {{the opposite end of the}} cut wire is sharp or pointed. <b>Round</b> <b>nose</b> <b>pliers</b> are pliers with conical jaws and are used for making loops in wire. Chain nose or bent chain nose pliers have flat smooth jaws and are used for gripping and holding wire and for bending wire. Flat nose pliers are just what the name implies…they are flat on both inside surfaces and are used to keep areas flat or to make 90-degree bends in your wire.|$|E

50|$|The Ag m/42 rear sight has two {{bullet drop}} {{compensation}} options, one calibrated for spitzer m/41 ammunition {{and one for}} <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> m/94 ammunition. Which one is installed can be seen between the sight screw and the range window. The bullet image (spitzer or <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> bullet) should match the ammunition used. With a hand adjustable elevation screw the rear sight can be adjusted for bullet drop in 100 m increments. From 100 to 800 m with m/41 spitzer ammunition, or 100 to 600 m m with m/94 <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> ammunition.|$|R

50|$|Austrian pilots often {{removed the}} {{propeller}} spinner from early production aircraft, {{since it was}} prone to falling off in flight. Beginning with aircraft 112 of the series 153 production run, Oeffag introduced a new <b>rounded</b> <b>nose</b> that eliminated the spinner. Remarkably, German wind-tunnel tests showed that the simple <b>rounded</b> <b>nose</b> improved propeller efficiency and raised the top speed by 14 km/h (9 mph).|$|R
5000|$|Although the [...]22 Long Rifle has {{surpassed the}} [...]22 Short {{in the market}} place, many {{ammunition}} companies still produce [...]22 Shorts, and in a fairly wide variety. Most makers utilize the standard [...] solid <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> bullet and [...] hollow point bullet weights for the [...]22 Short. Several types are made by CCI: a CB Short at 727 ft/s, target Shorts at 830 ft/s, their standard Short round with plated <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> bullet at 1080 ft/s, and a high speed hunting load with plated hollow point bullet at 1105 ft/s. The [...]22 Short high-velocity exceeds {{the performance of the}} [...]22 Long (with the exception of CCI's High Velocity 1217fps Long loading), and the [...]22 Short has displaced the [...]22 Long as an alternate to the [...]22 Long Rifle for many [...]22 shooters. Fiocchi makes their Exacta Compensated Super Match SM200 with lead <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> at 650 ft/s. Remington produces a high velocity plated <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> at 1095 ft/s. Aguila makes both a match lead <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> at 1095 ft/s, and a [...] "high speed" [...] round with plated bullet also listed at 1095 ft/s. Also available is the RWS R25 match ammunition at 560 ft/s. Eley also makes their rapid fire match cartridge at 750 ft/s.|$|R

40|$|This work {{is mainly}} {{concerned}} with the nondestructive post-impact damage evaluation of carbon fibre reinforced laminated composite panels subject to low velocity drop-weight impact by flat and <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> impactors. Quasi-isotropic laminates consisting of eight-, sixteen-, and twenty-four plies were impacted by flat and <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> impactors at different velocity levels. Load-time history data were recorded and plotted to correlate loaddrop as damage level to the impactor nose profiles. Test produced data, non-destructive damage detection techniques: visual, ultrasonic, and eddy- current, and computer simulations were utilised to identify and quantify status of the impact induced damage. To evaluate damage in relatively thick laminates (consisting of 24 -Ply), the damage ratios and deflection quantities were correlated to the corresponding impactor nose profiles. Damage induced by the flat nose impactor to thick laminates was compared against the data produced by the <b>round</b> <b>nose</b> impactor. Results show that relatively thin laminates were largely affected by the impactor nose. Reasonable difference was observed in damage caused by flat and <b>round</b> impactor <b>nose</b> profiles to thick laminates impacted at relatively higher velocity impacts. Resultswere compared and validated against simulation produced data...|$|R

50|$|In {{building}} vehicles, players {{learn about}} good, better and best principles. For example, that a <b>rounded</b> <b>nose</b> {{on a car}} is more aerodynamic and faster than a flat nose, and a pointed nose is better still.|$|R

50|$|In general, {{a pointed}} {{projectile}} {{will have a}} better drag coefficient (Cd) or ballistic coefficient (BC) than a <b>round</b> <b>nosed</b> bullet, and a <b>round</b> <b>nosed</b> bullet {{will have a better}} Cd or BC than a flat point bullet. Large radius curves, resulting in a shallower point angle, will produce lower drags, particularly at supersonic velocities. Hollow point bullets behave much like a flat point of the same point diameter. Projectiles designed for supersonic use often have a slightly tapered base at the rear, called a boat tail, which reduces air resistance in flight. Cannelures, which are recessed rings around the projectile used to crimp the projectile securely into the case, will cause an increase in drag.|$|R
