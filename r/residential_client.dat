40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the factors which define and predict the satisfaction of first-time <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> of architects in Nigeria using Lagos as a case study. Design/methodology/approach – The study was based on the notion that satisfaction of first-time <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> with architectural services is a combination of satisfaction with service, design and relationship qualities as well as reputation of the architect. A cross-sectional survey of randomly selected first-time <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> of architects in the study area was conducted using pre-tested questionnaire as the principal data gathering instrument. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor and regression analyses. Findings – Of the seven factors identified, the factors which best define the satisfaction of the first-time <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> were personalization of service, reliability of, confidence inspired by and personality of the architect. The best predictors of the satisfaction of the first-time <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> of architects in Nigeria varied with the nature of service. However, it was observed that the experience of the architect cut across all service types as a significant predictor of client satisfaction. Research limitation/implication – Only <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> were considered in the study. Other categories of clients may be considered in further studies. Practical implications – There is need for architects to consider the nature of services provided in their quest to satisfy their first-time <b>residential</b> <b>clients.</b> Originality/value – Previous studies have focused on experienced and mostly public sector clients. This study provides empirical data on the factors that influence the satisfaction of first-time private clients who engaged the services of architects for their personal homes...|$|R

40|$|Although recent {{research}} has shown that drug abuse treatment reduces drug use and criminal activity in some clients, the impact of treatment on clients' post-treatment labor market behavior is relatively unknown. This study uses data from a longitudinal survey to analyze annual legal and illegal earnings for 2, 420 drug abusers. The analysis focuses on two different time intervals-one year before entering a drug abuse treatment program and one year after leaving the same program. It describes client characteristics, labor market variables, and treatment history, and estimates the effects of length of time in treatment on post-treatment earnings. The regression analysis shows that length of time in treatment had a positive (negative) and statistically significant impact on real legal (illegal) earnings following treatment for methadone and <b>residential</b> <b>clients,</b> but the magnitude was small; accounting for possible selection bias had little effect on the results. Although <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> experienced the largest relative changes in earnings outcomes, simply comparing the direct cost of residential treatment with the benefits from improved legal earnings and lower illegal earnings suggests that additional residential treatment is not cost-beneficial.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays, each dealing with an emerging type of operational contracts. The first essay considers a resource exchange model where the effects of collaboration and competition are intertwined. Exchanging resources often improves utilization and is intended to increase profitability of involved firms. However, it does not guarantee success in competitive settings. More efficient use of resources might actually leads to increased competition. We explore how resource exchange contracts impact the firms and consumers. The {{results indicate that the}} resource exchange tends to benefit both firms and the consumers in most situations, except for the extreme situations where simultaneously competition is strong and the purchasing cost is either very low or very high. The second essay focuses on vertical pricing control contracts that manufacturers use to coordinate online and offline retailers. Resale Price Maintenance (RPM) policy requires all retailers to sell at the price suggested by manufacturers. Minimum Advertised Price (MAP) policy is less strict, as it allows retailers to sell at lower prices than the manufacturer suggested, as long as these lower prices are not advertised. This essay studies which of these two policies is more beneficial to each member of the supply chain. We show that manufacturers prefer MAP policy when the customers' valuations vary significantly and the information search requires significant effort. The MAP policy is also favorable to retailers and consumers under similar market conditions. The third essay concerns the contractual issues when energy service companies (ESCOs) provide energy efficiency projects to <b>residential</b> <b>clients.</b> While performance based contracts have been proven successful in public, commercial, and industrial sectors, ESCOs face challenges in the <b>residential</b> sector. <b>Residential</b> <b>clients</b> often change consumption behavior after the project, which makes the real energy savings difficult to measure. Additionally, <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> are much more risk averse and vulnerable to uncertain outcomes of projects. We show that piecewise linear contracts perform reasonably well. To further improve profitability, ESCOs can either reduce uncertainty of technology involved or develop the ability to verify post-project energy efficiency. We also make recommendations in monetary incentives and regulations from policy makers' perspective...|$|R

Although <b>residential</b> <b>clients</b> experienced the largest relative changes in weeks worked and real earnings, a benefit-cost calculation suggests that additional residential treatment cannot be justified from earnings improvements alone.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{evaluated}} {{the impact of}} case management on client retention in treatment and short-term relapse for clients in the publicly funded substance abuse treatment system. METHODS: A retrospective cohort design was used to study clients discharged from the following four modalities in 1993 and 1994 : short-term <b>residential</b> (3112 <b>clients),</b> long-term <b>residential</b> (2888 <b>clients),</b> outpatient (7431 <b>clients),</b> and <b>residential</b> detox (7776 <b>clients).</b> Logistic regression models were {{used to analyze the}} impact of case management after controlling for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: The odds that case-managed clients reached a length of stay previously identified as associated with more successful treatment were 1. 6 (outpatient programs) to 3. 6 (short-term residential programs) times higher than the odds for non-case-managed clients. With the exception of outpatient clients, the odds of case-managed clients' being admitted to detox within 90 days after discharge (suggesting relapse) were about two thirds those of non-case-managed clients. The odds of case-managed detox clients' transitioning to post-detox treatment (a good outcome) were 1. 7 times higher than the odds for non-case-managed clients.

40|$|Unbundling of {{the local}} loop (ULL) has seen quite {{different}} "success stories" in the various countries across Europe. Although the obligation {{for the provision of}} ULL was implemented in the regulatory framework early and mostly parallel to other means of liberalisation, national implementation has been rather heterogeneous. One question of decisive importance for national regulatory authorities (NRAs) was whether to foster service-based competition in the first phase of liberalisation or to focus on infrastructurebased competition. The different NRAs chose to head down different roads. This paper analyses whether the strategy of NRAs has had any mid-term effect on the economic welfare created in the communications markets. It indicates that infrastructure-based competition has a positive effect on innovation. Moreover, infrastructure-based competition appears to be more important for business customers than for <b>residential</b> <b>clients.</b> On the other hand, service-based competition lowers call prices and appears to be more important to residential markets. The results of this study point out the importance of a balanced approach to both types of policies. ...|$|R

40|$|Near-future {{electric}} {{distribution grids}} operation {{will have to}} rely on demand-side flexibility, both by implementation of demand response strategies and by taking advantage of the intelligent management of increasingly common small-scale energy storage. The Home energy management system (HEMS), installed at low voltage <b>residential</b> <b>clients,</b> will play a crucial role on the flexibility provision to both system operators and market players like aggregators. Modeling and forecasting multi-period flexibility from residential prosumers, such as battery storage and electric water heater, while complying with internal constraints (comfort levels, data privacy) and uncertainty is a complex task. This papers describes a computational method that is capable of efficiently learn and define the feasibility flexibility space from controllable resources connected to a HEMS. An Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) algorithm is adopted and reshaped to derive a set of feasible temporal trajectories for the residential net-load, considering storage, flexible appliances, and predefined costumer preferences, as well as load and photovoltaic (PV) forecast uncertainty.
