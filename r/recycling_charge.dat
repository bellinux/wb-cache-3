40|$|Abstract—Design of a {{suitable}} power gating (e. g., multithreshold CMOS or super cutoff CMOS) structure {{is an important}} and challenging task in sub- 90 nm VLSI circuits where leakage currents are significant. In designs where the mode transitions are frequent, {{a significant amount of}} energy is consumed to turn on or off the power gating structure. It is thus desirable to develop a power gating solution that minimizes the energy consumed during mode transitions. This paper presents such a solution by <b>recycling</b> <b>charge</b> between the virtual power and ground rails immediately after entering the sleep mode and just before wakeup. The proposed method can save up to 43 % of the dynamic energy wasted during mode transition while maintaining the wake up time of the original circuit. It also reduces the peak negative voltage value and the settling time of the ground bounce. A I...|$|E

The aim {{of this study is to}} find an evidence for presence of potassium channel in endoplasmic ticulum and considering the pharmacological and biophysical properties of this channel. Methods: Hepatocytes RER vesicles were isolated by homogenizing rat liver followed by several centrifuging eps and then incorporated into the bilayer lipid membrane (BLM). The BLM was formed by painting osphatidylcholine across the 350 ?m aperture seperating two chambers (cis chamber containing 200 mM KCl + d trans chamber containing 50 mM KCl). Single channel recordings were used to indicate the presence of K annels. Results: Single channel recordings revealed the existence of a cation selective channel with high permeability + K and 599 pS conductance. The current–voltage relation was linear. The open probability was strongly voltage pendent, showing higher values at positive voltages and lower at negative voltages. A subconductance state out 60 % of fully open state was observed at all voltages.

40|$|UnrestrictedImportance {{of energy}} {{efficiency}} in electronic systems is ever increasing, from embedded {{systems such as}} smart phones to large scale distributed systems such as datacenters. Modern battery-powered, embedded systems are complex devices providing various functionalities while supporting {{a wide range of}} applications, leading to complex energy profile and necessitating energy efficient design for longer battery life. On {{the other end of the}} spectrum lie the complex large-scale distributed systems such as data centers. Such systems consume not only significant computing power but also cooling power in order to remove the heat generated by the information technology equipment. The issue of energy efficiency in such systems can be addressed at various levels of system design, e. g., circuit/architecture level design time solutions or operating system/application level runtime solutions. In this thesis, we present circuit and architecture level design time solutions for modern microprocessors based on the concept of charge sharing, a technique that is applicable to all kinds of systems independent of the usage scenario, and system level run time solutions based on energy-aware resource allocation that is mostly applicable to data centers.; At the circuit level, we introduce a charge recycling based optimization approach for 1) write operation power minimization in on-chip memory structures with dedicated write ports, such as register file, issue queue, reorder buffer, etc., where charge among bit-lines is recycled in order to reduce voltage swing on bit-lines and 2) power minimization in off-chip data buses by <b>recycling</b> <b>charge</b> in a sequential manner where charge from bus lines experiencing falling transitions is recycled to bus lines with rising transitions, in multiple charge sharing cycles, so as to recycle more charge compared to simultaneous charge recycling techniques.; Extending the idea of charge recycling to data caches with shared read write ports, we describe a new cache architecture that can dynamically switch between the charge sharing based write operation mode and regular cache operation mode. At architecture level, we employ a clustered store retirement technique, to delay the instruction retirement for store operations, in order to group stores together to generate back-to-back cache writes so that the writes can take advantage of the underlying circuit support for charge recycling to reduce the write operation power.; The aforementioned design time solutions are equally applicable independent of the workloads system is running under. At a level higher where the underlying system design is fixed, we employ, for given set of workloads and hardware resources, intelligent resource allocation to achieve energy efficient resource assignment in large scale distributed systems such as hosting centers. Heterogeneity present among the servers in such large scale distributed systems along with non energy proportional behavior of these servers make the task of resource allocation non-trivial. Using generalized networks we capture power and performance heterogeneity among servers while modeling utilization dependent non energy proportional behavior. We present a generalized network flow based resource allocation algorithm that, where nodes represent workloads and resources, finds close-to-optimal solution in the presence of resource heterogeneity and non energy proportionality, while meeting the stipulated service level agreements (SLAs) ...|$|E
