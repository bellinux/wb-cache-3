50|$|When {{sequencing}} a genome, it must {{be broken}} down into pieces that are short enough to be sequenced in a single read. These reads must then be put back together like a jigsaw puzzle by aligning the regions that overlap between reads; this process is called de novo genome assembly. The longer the read length that a sequencing platform provides, the longer the overlapping regions, and the easier it is to assemble the genome. From a computational perspective, microfluidic Sanger sequencing is still {{the most effective way to}} sequence and assemble genomes for which no reference genome sequence exists. The relatively long read lengths provide substantial overlap between individual sequencing reads, which allows for greater statistical confidence in the assembly. In addition, long Sanger reads are able to span most regions of <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> which otherwise confound sequence assembly by causing false alignments. However, de novo genome assembly by Sanger sequencing is extremely expensive and time consuming. Second generation sequencing technologies, while less expensive, are generally unfit for de novo genome assembly due to short read lengths. In general, third generation sequencing technologies, including transmission electron microscopy DNA sequencing, aim to improve read length while maintaining low sequencing cost. Thus, as third generation sequencing technologies improve, rapid and inexpensive de novo genome assembly will become a reality.|$|E

The mechanism by which MyoD regulates the muscle development program is very well understood. However, the transcriptional regulation of the MyoD gene itself has not studied in Xenopus. In this thesis, I have analyzed the transcriptional regulatory mechanism of the MyoD gene in Xenopus by different approaches, which include transgenic reporter analysis of its cis-regulatory elements of MyoD transcription and gain-of-function and loss-of-function tests of several potential regulaters. Here I showed that the expression of the XmyoD gene is controlled by a combination of induction, repression and maintenance. One activating motif, one repressing motif and one maintenance motif were found by transgenic reporter analysis. XSRF (Xenopus serum response factor) binds with the maintenance enhancer to maintain the expression of XmyoD gene. A <b>repetitive</b> <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> was discovered in the - 2. 8 /- 2. 0 kb region in the XmyoD genomic sequence.
