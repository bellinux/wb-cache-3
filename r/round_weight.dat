40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{bandwidth}} allocation and routing in wireless networks. A first model of this problem is known as the <b>Round</b> <b>Weighting</b> Problem (RWP) in which a weight is assigned to the set of rounds, i. e. a set of pairwise non-interfering links. We present a new formulation that forgets about the routing and concentrate on the capacity available on the network cuts. We use the maximum flow/minimum cut theorem known in graph theory to develop the Cut Covering Problem (CCP) and prove that it computes equivalent optimal <b>round</b> <b>weights</b> than RWP.

This means just seven 12-gauge buckshot shells weigh approximately the same (.45 kilos/one pound) as thirty 5.56×45mm rifle cartridges. While an individual soldier can easily carry several hundred rifle or pistol cartridges in box magazines, only a few dozen shotshells can be carried practically.|$|E
50|$|Because the {{ammunition}} was {{developed from the}} standard infantry mortar, any type of round developed for the mortar could have been readily adapted for the 8H63, including high-explosive (HE), smoke and illuminating rounds. The HE round, the 8 cm W Gr Patr 5071 with a 4.46 kg projectile and total <b>round</b> <b>weight</b> of 8.30 kg was developed. This could employ three different charge increments for maximum ranges of 3,400 meters @ 220 mps, 5,600 meters @ 320 mps or 6,200 meters at 420 mps - about three times {{the range of the}} mortar and with the possibility of direct or indirect fire. This performance brings up another interesting feature of this gun. Traditional high-velocity anti-tank guns were very inefficient when employed as field artillery firing explosive rounds in support of the infantry. The thick projectile walls necessary to withstand high velocities ensured a small explosive payload and the amount of propellent used was wasteful. The guns also fired at low trajectories (+22 degrees for a PAK 40), which limited their utility. For this reason, the German Army had always employed Infantry Guns, such as the 7.5 cm leichtes Infanteriegeschütz 18, at the regimental level to provide fire support under the direct and immediate control of the infantry. This meant that every infantry regiment had an infantry gun company for use against unarmored targets and a tank destroyer (anti-tank gun) company for use against armored targets. The 8H63, firing an explosive round that had a lethality almost comparable to the 7.5 cm infantry gun and had a greater range. The 8H63's multi-charge cartridge, 55 degree traverse (fine for anti-tank defence) and +32 degree maximum elevation could have allowed the merger of the infantry and anti-tank gun categories with resulting savings in production, logistics, and precious manpower. The 8H63 was to be organized under the new 1945 Table of Organization and Equipment (TO&E) in anti-tank companies of 12 guns with 104 men, replacing the anti-tank and infantry gun companies (300+ men) of previous organizations.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{define and}} study an {{optimization}} {{problem that is}} motivated by bandwidth allocation in radio networks. Because radio transmissions are subject to interference constraints in radio networks, physical space is a common resource that the nodes have to share in such a way, that concurrent transmissions do not interfere. The bandwidth allocation problem we study under these constraints is the following. Given bandwidth (traffic) demands between the nodes of the network, {{the objective is to}} schedule the radio transmissions {{in such a way that}} the traffic demands are satisfied. The problem is similar to a multicommodity flow problem, where the capacity constraints are replaced by the more complex notion of non-interfering transmissions. We provide a formal specification of the problem that we call <b>round</b> <b>weighting.</b> By modeling non-interfering radio transmissions as independent sets, we relate the complexity of <b>round</b> <b>weighting</b> to the complexity of various independent set problems (e. g.  maximum weight independent set, vertex coloring, fractional coloring). From this relation, we deduce that in general, <b>round</b> <b>weighting</b> is hard to approximate within n 1 −ε (n being the size of the radio network). We also provide polynomial (exact or approximation) algorithms e. g.  in the following two cases: (a) when the interference constraints are specific (for instance for a network whose vertices belong to the Euclidean space), or (b) when the traffic demands are directed towards a unique node in the network (also called gathering, analogous to single commodity flow) ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an observer trip on a Japanese freezer longliner {{in the international}} waters of the North East Atlantic {{in the autumn of}} 1997. The observation period was 71 days during which 7 species were recorded as catch and bycatch from 57 sets. Although bluefin tuna was the target species, with 18, 894 kg gilled and gutted weight (GWT) caught, the most frequently retained species was blue shark, Prionace glauca, followed by bluefin tuna. Three shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, one swordfish, Xiphias gladius and one anglerfish, Lophius spp., were also recorded. The most frequently discarded species were lancetfish Alepisaurus ferox, and deal fish Trachipterus arcticus. Bluefin tuna ranged from 139 cm to 275 cm in fork length (FL) and from 64 kg to 347 kg in <b>round</b> <b>weight</b> (RWT) with clear modes of 190 cm and 136 kg. Recent ageing results from the North East Atlantic infer ages of 4 to 17 years old. CPUE was lower than Norwegian sponsored trials in the North East Atlantic in 1998 and similar to those computed by the Japanese longline observer programme in 2000, 2001 and 2002. There was no evidence of trend in bluefin CPUE {{over the course of the}} observation period. The modelled length weight relationship predicted higher values than established length weight relationships for bluefin tuna in the East Atlantic: ICCAT modelled RWT for East Atlantic bluefin was 87 % of the observed <b>round</b> <b>weight</b> and 90 % of the predicted RWT value for Koshin Maru # 8 tuna. Over the observation period the condition of bluefin tuna was found to decline and examination of stomachs showed that most were empty or contained low numbers of prey items. Declining condition factors and apparent scarcity of prey are discussed in the context of CPUE. Prey scarcity reflected in declining condition may increase the effectiveness of baited hooks causing abundance estimates derived from CPUE series to over-estimate the population of bluefin tuna in the North East Atlantic. Investigation of condition indices has the potential to estimate stock ratios in longline catches in the North Atlantic. All observed blue shark catch were female with lengths ranging from 140 cm to 250 cm. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E

40|$|The {{census of}} {{agriculture}} is {{an important source of}} statistics about the Nation’s agricultural production and provides consistent, comparable data at the county, state, and national levels. Each census record has weights which are used to produce totals for the entire population. The process of <b>rounding</b> <b>weights</b> to integer values has been in place for the last several censuses. When a record’s <b>weight</b> is <b>rounded</b> to an integer value, the totals represented by that record may or may not change dramatically. These changes may or may not become negligible when producing totals at the state or county level. This report compares totals calculated with the noninteger weights to the published totals (calculated with the integer weights) for the 1997 Census of Agriculture, evaluates how different these totals are, and examines how the differences relate to the standard error. The analysis examines a number of characteristics at both the state and county levels. The report also examines another weighting approach where the noninteger weights are applied to the record and the weighted data values are rounded at the record level. The difference between totals produced with these values and the noninteger weights is calculated and compared to the above differences. The reasons for <b>rounding</b> <b>weights,</b> to ease data review procedures and to ensure that publication totals add, are legitimate concerns.

It was shown that applying Tukey’s Outlier filtering procedure significantly improved the coefficient of determination (R 2) in these datasets in which R 2 was initially low, demonstrating that applying Tukey’s Outlier method to K can provide more accurate L-W relationships for Atlantic bluefin tuna.

40|$|The satellite-based vessel {{monitoring}} {{system in the}} Norwegian Economic Zone provides detailed information about individual trips by vessels. Vessel sizes are available through official registries, and the storage capacity for fish is estimated using the established conver-sion factors {{as a function of}} the vessel’s gross registered tonnage.

The analysis assumes that trips with complete documentation of the fish on board are a random sample, so allowing estimation of the mean amount of both cod and haddock per trip, and annual totals give the number of trips per vessel annually. ICES has accepted this methodology for estimating illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) catches, which has resulted in 15 000 – 166 000 t (3 – 35 %) being added to the officially reported landings of Northeast Arctic cod during the years 2002 – 2008.
