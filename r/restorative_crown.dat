40|$|An {{articulator}} is {{a mechanical}} device {{which represents the}} temporomandibular joints and jaw members to which maxillary and mandibular cast may he attached to simulate jaw movements. Articulators have traditionally {{been used in the}} fabrication of fixed and removable dental restorations. They are also used in diagnosis of dental occlusal conditions, treatment planning, selective grinding, functional diagnostic prewax, orthodontic set-up and designing fixed <b>restorative</b> <b>crowns</b> and bridges. During the past 150 years, many types of articulators have evolved and placed in the market. This evolution began with the simple hinge mechanism and continued to the present day adjustable articulators. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to historically follow the evolution of articulators and discuss their classifications and functional features. King Saud Universit...|$|R

The objective of this report is to display a new interdisciplinary approach which combining endodontic root canal treatment, orthodontic extrusion, periodontal crown lengthening surgery and prosthodontic post-core-crown restoration procedures to restore a crown-root subgingival fractured maxillary central incisor and achieved a satisfied cosmetic result. Computer-based spectrophotometer was also used to accurately select colour without objective interference to achieve ideal cosmetic effects...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In the {{inaccessible}} {{areas on}} the crown the removal of calculus and stains by hand and ultrasonic instrumentation is the method for cleaning to preserve and increase the longevity of the restoration. However, when oral prophylaxis is performed on <b>restorative</b> <b>crowns,</b> it may produce some surface alterations and may favour plaque accumulation. Statement of Problem: Many patients may have restored their teeth with artificial crowns and {{would come to the}} dental office for oral prophylaxis. If a routine oral prophylaxis is followed, its effect on the restorative materials and the plaque accumulation can be studied. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 disc shaped wax patterns were invested and casted for cast titanium (Group A) and the remaining 15 disk shaped for nickel-chromium (Group B). The obtained castings were finished and polished. All the specimens were subjected to hand and ultrasonic scaling for 15 s. Profilometer and scanning electron microscopic was used to analyze and evaluate the surface roughness. Specimens of each group were embedded on the anterior lingual aspects of the removable lower retention plates. 5 volunteers were asked to wear it in the mouth for 24 h for 7 days. After 7 days, the specimens were stained with plaque disclosing solutions and the photomicrographs were taken by the optical stereomicroscope and the plaque accumulations were assessed in percentage. Results: The difference in average surface roughness (μm) of the polished test specimens was maximum for ultrasonic scaling than hand scaling and maximum for Group A than Group B. Plaque accumulation in percentage on the treated specimens was found to be nonsignificant but, mean plaque accumulation was maximum on ultrasonic scaling surface than hand scaling and maximum for Group A than Group B. Surface roughness was found to be statistically significant after hand scaling (F = 9. 377, P = 0. 000) and ultrasonic scaling (F = 5. 373, P = 0. 0000) by Student t-test. Conclusion: The Surface roughness and plaque accumulation on the specimens were more for Group A than Group B and maximum produced by ultrasonic scaling than hand scaling...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{investigate}} Medicare rebate claim trends under the Australian Chronic Disease Dental Scheme (CDDS) over time, region and type of service. Methods: CDDS data obtained from the Department of Human Services reflected all Medicare item claims lodged under the CDDS by dental practitioners and processed by Medicare. Retrospective analysis of CDDS rebate claims was conducted. Results: The CDDS rebates for the period 2008 – 13 totalled A$ 2. 8 billion. Just under 81 % of claims were from dental practitioners working in major cities. The most frequent rebates were for crown, bridge and implant (32. 4 %), removable prostheses (22. 4 %) and restorative services (21. 3 %). The rebate claims of <b>restorative</b> services, <b>crown</b> and bridge, and removable prostheses per dentist in all regional areas increased over the time of the CDDS. Per capita, the rebates for every type of dental service were lower in the more remote regions. Conclusions: Rebate claims increased in each of the last 3 full years of the CDDS across all areas. The majority of Medicare rebate claims were from major city areas and for crown and bridge, removable prostheses and restorative services. The service mix varied between regions. Leonard A.

40|$|AbstractIntroduction: Knowledge of {{prevalence}} and etiologic factors of tooth discoloration can help design strategies for intervention to prevent tooth discoloration. The {{aim of this}} study was to determine the {{prevalence and}} etiologic factors of tooth discoloration in male high school students in Isfahan. Materials and methods: In this cross-sectional study, 384 male students were selected by cluster sampling method. The students were examined by a well-instructed individual. Data was collected and recorded using a questionnaire and then analyzed by descriptive methods in SPSS at a 95 % confidence interval. Results: The prevalence of tooth discoloration was 89. 9 % in male high school students in Isfahan. Relative frequencies of etiologic factors of tooth discoloration consisted of caries, 80. 6 %; hypoplasia, 18. 2 %; extrinsic stains, 9. 5 %; root and <b>crown</b> <b>restorative</b> materials, 4. 8 %; trauma, 1. 3 %; tetracycline and smoking, 0. 8 %; fluorosis, 0. 5 %; and chlorhexidine mouthwash, 0. 3 %. No cases of amelogenesis imperfecta, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and drug use by mothers during pregnancy. Conclusion: In this study caries was the most common cause of tooth discoloration. Given the high prevalence of carious lesions, instruction of oral hygiene habits and improving nutrition of the students are recommended.

40|$|Background: Latex {{protective}} barriers such as {{gloves and}} rubber dam material {{have been used}} widely in <b>restorative</b> procedures for <b>crown</b> and bridge. However, the chemical used during latex glove fabrication is thought to inhibit the polymerization of elastomeric impression materials used for impression making which has a detrimental effect on the dimensional accuracy and surface definition of resultant casts used for restorative procedures. The objectives {{of the study were}} to examine the surface of different elastomeric impressions on contact with various gloves. Materials and Methods: This clinical study included a total of eighty specimens of two types of the putty elastomeric impression material were hand manipulated by wearing three different gloves materials and is placed on a marked area of a clean and alcohol-treated glass slab at room temperature. The specimens examined for any signs of polymerization inhibition. The specimen will be rated as being “inhibited” if any residue remains on the glass slab and absence of the above will result as “no inhibition. ” Results: The results showed no interference with the polymerization inhibition of the selected elastomers followed by the nitrile glove. The latex gloves showed inhibited set of the elastomeric impression material but set after sometime confirming time-dependent inhibition of the impression material. Conclusion: This study shows that the use of latex and sometime nitrile gloves during crown and bridge procedures should be contraindicated and the use of vinyl gloves should be stressed when working with elastomeric impression materials...|$|R
