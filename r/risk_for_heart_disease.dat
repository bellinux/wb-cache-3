2500|$|On 11 July 2003, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{issued a}} {{regulation}} requiring manufacturers to list trans fat on the Nutrition Facts panel of foods and some dietary supplements. The new labeling rule became mandatory across the board, even {{for companies that}} petitioned for extensions, on 1 January 2008. However, unlike in many other countries, trans fat levels of less than 0.5grams per serving can be listed as 0grams trans fat on the food label. According to {{a study published in}} the Journal of Public Policy & Marketing, without an interpretive footnote or further information on recommended daily value, many consumers do not know how to interpret the meaning of trans fat content on the Nutrition Facts panel. In fact, without specific prior knowledge about trans fat and its negative health effects, consumers, including those at <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> <b>heart</b> <b>disease,</b> may misinterpret nutrient information provided on the panel. The FDA did not approve nutrient content claims such as [...] "trans fat free" [...] or [...] "low trans fat", as they could not determine a [...] "recommended daily value". Nevertheless, the agency is planning a consumer study to evaluate the consumer understanding of such claims and perhaps consider a regulation allowing their use on packaged foods. However, there is no requirement to list trans fats on institutional food packaging; thus bulk purchasers such as schools, hospitals, jails and cafeterias are unable to evaluate the trans fat content of commercial food items.|$|E

Methods: We evaluated 1185 men and 1141 women aged 20 – 79 years of predominantly Anglo-Celtic descent from the 1994 – 95 assessment of the Busselton population in Western Australia.
