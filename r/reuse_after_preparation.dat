Twenty-seven teeth were submitted to three cone beam tomographic analyses, one preoperatively, and two <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with file size 35,. 02 taper and size 50,. 02 taper. Canal transportation and centring ability were measured {{with reference to}} the distance between the noninstrumented portion of the root canals and the mesial and distal periphery of the root, compared with images obtained <b>after</b> the <b>preparation</b> with size 35 and 50 instruments. Canal transportation <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with the size 35 file was 0. 030 +/- 0. 253 mm and after the size 50 file was 0. 057 +/- 0. 317 mm. The centring ratio values <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with the size 35 file was 0. 42 +/- 0. 32 and after the size 50 file was 0. 54 +/- 0. 29, with no significant statistical difference between the groups.

40|$|Tese de mestrado, Medicina Dentária, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Medicina Dentária, 2016 INTRODUCTION: The major {{goals of}} endodontic {{treatment}} {{is to preserve}} the functinal teeth, by removing from the root canal system; obturate the cleaned and shaped system; and prevent future recontamination of sealed root canals. AIMS: The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare 3 D measures between three different systems; manual instrumentation with K-Filesand two rotary files: ProTaper GoldTM and WaveOne GoldTM, in naturale root canals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty three extracted first maxillary permanent teeth were selected for this study. Three groups were created, 11 in each one, and it was selected randomly and blind. Then each was prepared by one of selected systems: Group 1 =K-files; Group 2 =WaveOne Gold TM; Group 3 =ProTaper GoldTM. In collaboration with CDRsp IP Leiria, it was used X-ray micro-CT. RESULTS: The increase in volume <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with ProTaper GoldTM file was significantly higher than the increase <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with K-files (p = 0. 024). There was no statistically significant difference between WaveOne GoldTM and ProTaper GoldTM or between WaveOne GoldTM and K-files. The increase in diameter <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with WaveOne GoldTM file, and ProTaper GoldTM also, was significantly higher than the increase in diameter <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with K-files (p = 0. 014, p = 0. 013, respectively). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Possibly that WaveOne GoldTM represents a mid way system, not statistically significant, however possible not so intrusive and not so unobtrusive like other two systems. There was significantly increased diameter <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with WaveOne GoldTM and ProTaper GoldTM file compared with the increase in diameter <b>after</b> <b>preparation</b> with K-files, and its seems that two Gold files have almost the same result. This significant increase of diameter, in these two rotatory files, is one of an indisputable characteristic for irrigation mission to success, as well as endodontic treatment...|$|R
