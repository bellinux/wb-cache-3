40|$|The {{influence}} of different annealing conditions on <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profiles</b> of He and H ions implanted lithium niobate planar waveguides have been studied. After annealing treatment with different time and different temperature the dark modes of {{both kinds of}} waveguides were measured by using a prism coupling method.

40|$|We {{describe}} a non-destructive and accurate fibre <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profiling</b> method with high spatial resolution based on Quantitative Phase Microscopy. This technique entails taking {{a series of}} three bright-field images of an axisymmetric optical fibre with a conventional microscope, consisting of an in-focus image, and a pair of slightly defocused images. Using an algorithm based on the transport of intensity equation we can then calculate the phase across the fibre. Once the phase is known, it is then analysed using the inverse Abel transform.

The effective <b>refractive</b> <b>indices</b> of the modes for guides produced by electric field assisted exchange exhibit an unusual evolution with annealing time. The area under the <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profiles</b> produced from the measurements shows a significant reduction with annealing time.

50|$|Spatially, {{an intense}} {{beam of light}} in a medium will produce {{a change in the}} medium's {{refractive}} index that mimics the transverse intensity pattern of the beam. For example, a Gaussian beam results in a Gaussian <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile,</b> similar to that of a gradient-index lens. This causes the beam to focus itself, a phenomenon known as self-focusing.|$|E
50|$|Because {{parts of}} the core closer to the fiber axis have a higher {{refractive}} index than the parts near the cladding, light rays follow sinusoidal paths down the fiber. The most common <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> for a graded-index fiber is very nearly parabolic.

50|$|The {{matching}} {{of active}} and passive fibers can be optimized in several ways. The easiest method for matching the signal carrying light {{is to have}} identical NA and core diameters for each fiber. This however {{does not account for}} all the <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> features. Matching of the MFD is also a method used to create matched signal carrying fibers. It has been shown that matching all of these components provides the best set of fibers to build high power amplifiers and lasers. Essentially, the MFD is modeled and the resulting target NA and core diameter are developed. The core-rod is made and before being drawn into fiber its core diameter and NA are checked. Based on the refractive index measurements, the final core/clad ratio is determined and adjusted to the target MFD. This approach accounts for details of the <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> which can be measured easily and with high accuracy on the preform, before it is drawn into fiber.|$|E
50|$|In practice, Luneburg lenses are {{normally}} layered structures of discrete concentric shells, each {{of a different}} refractive index. These shells form a stepped <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> that differs slightly from Luneburg's solution.

Cylindrical analogues of the Luneburg lens are also used for collimating light from laser diodes.|$|E
50|$|For {{an optical}} fiber, a {{step-index}} profile is a <b>refractive</b> <b>index</b> <b>profile</b> {{characterized by a}} uniform refractive index within the core and a sharp decrease in refractive index at the core-cladding interface so that the cladding is of a lower refractive index. The step-index profile corresponds to a power-law index profile with the profile parameter approaching infinity. The step-index profile is used in most single-mode fibers and some multimode fibers.|$|E
