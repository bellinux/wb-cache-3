5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 17th century, Swedish {{warships}} were built in the Dutch manner, with a flat, rectangular bottom with a small draft. This shipbuilding style was adapted mainly for smaller ships in the shallow coastal waters of the Netherlands, and allowed for quick construction, but these less sturdy vessels were generally unsuitable as warships and somewhat unstable in rough seas. When Kronan was built, the English approach to building had prevailed, giving hulls a more <b>rounded</b> <b>bottom</b> and greater draft, as well as a sturdier frame and increased stability. The stern was more streamlined below the waterline, which lessened resistance.|$|E

25|$|Integrals {{appear in}} many {{practical}} situations. If {{a swimming pool}} is rectangular with a flat bottom, then from its length, width, and depth we can easily determine the volume of water it can contain (to fill it), the area of its surface (to cover it), {{and the length of}} its edge (to rope it). But if it is oval with a <b>rounded</b> <b>bottom,</b> all of these quantities call for integrals. Practical approximations may suffice for such trivial examples, but precision engineering (of any discipline) requires exact and rigorous values for these elements.|$|E

5000|$|Florence flask: A flask {{similar to}} the {{flat-bottomed}} flask that has round bodies and either a <b>round</b> <b>bottom</b> or a flat bottom so that one can stand the flask on a level surface. Florence flasks typically have one neck which is longer and may be somewhat wider than the usual neck of a <b>round</b> <b>bottom</b> flask. The necks of traditional Florence flasks often {{do not have a}} ground glass joint like modern <b>round</b> <b>bottom</b> flasks do. Round-bottom flasks are used more commonly by professional chemists than Florence flasks.|$|R

25|$|The Pockets: {{the pockets}} of a Neapolitan jackets are curved and applied as patches; the breast pocket is called “a barchetta”, which means “little boat”, due to the higher top corner of the pocket, which, along with the <b>rounded</b> <b>bottom,</b> gives it {{the shape of a}} stylized boat. The side pockets are equally curved, and their shape recalls that of a pot – hence the name “a pignata”. Neither of these {{features}} have any practical functionality, but they are particular to Neapolitan tailoring and they contribute to the sophisticated yet relaxed look of a jacket made in Naples. As an ultimate touch of elegance, double hand finished stitching runs throughout the sides of the patch pockets – a recurring feature in informal Neapolitan tailoring.|$|E
2500|$|The Atlantic sawtail {{catshark}} is rarer {{than the}} blackmouth catshark, which shares its range. Its natural history is poorly understood. Reproduction is oviparous, with mating and spawning proceeding throughout the year. Females can contain up to nine maturing eggs at a time, {{divided between the}} two functional oviducts. The tough egg case is flask-shaped and reddish, with a <b>rounded</b> <b>bottom</b> {{and a pair of}} [...] "horns" [...] at the top, and measuring around [...] long and [...] across. The egg case of G. melastomus is similar in appearance but significantly larger. Once deposited, the egg hatches within a short period of time. According to Compagno (2005), males attain sexual maturity at about [...] long, and females at about [...] long. Rey and colleagues (2010) reported the smallest mature males and females in their study to be [...] and [...] long respectively.|$|E
2500|$|The {{so-called}} [...] "pit of despair" [...] {{was used}} in experiments conducted on rhesus macaque monkeys during the 1970s by American comparative psychologist Harry Harlow at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. The {{aim of the research}} was to produce clinical depression. The vertical chamber was a stainless-steel bin with slippery sides that sloped to a <b>rounded</b> <b>bottom.</b> A 3/8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop out of holes. The chamber had a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top so that the monkeys were unable to escape. Harlow placed baby monkeys in the chamber alone for up to six weeks. Within a few days, they stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner. [...] The monkeys generally exhibited marked social impairment and peer hostility when removed from the chamber; most did not recover.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} purposed {{to compare the}} {{stability}} of four types of pole and liner casco (<b>round</b> <b>bottom,</b> <b>round</b> flat <b>bottom,</b> <b>round</b> sharp <b>bottom</b> and u-v bottom),. The stability value was analyzed by calculating the stability on the curve with the heeling angle of 0 - 90 °. The stability results of each casco type were then compared with the criteria of minimum standard value derived from IMO (International Maritime Organization). Results showed that the four casco types had greater stability values than IMO standard values.

60|$|The vessel {{in which}} Cap and his niece had {{embarked}} for their long and adventurous journey {{was one of}} the canoes of bark which the Indians are in the habit of constructing, and which, by their exceeding lightness and the ease with which they are propelled, are admirably adapted to a navigation in which shoals, flood-wood, and other similar obstructions so often occur. The two men who composed its original crew had several times carried it, when emptied of its luggage, many hundred yards; and it would not have exceeded the strength of a single man to lift its weight. Still it was long, and, for a canoe, wide; a want of steadiness being its principal defect {{in the eyes of the}} uninitiated. A few hours practice, however, in a great measure remedied this evil, and both Mabel and her uncle had learned so far to humor its movements, that they now maintained their places with perfect composure; nor did the additional weight of the three guides tax its power in any particular degree, the breath of the <b>rounded</b> <b>bottom</b> allowing the necessary quantity of water to be displaced without bringing the gunwale very sensibly nearer to the surface of the stream. Its workmanship was neat; the timbers were small, and secured by thongs; and the whole fabric, though it was so slight to the eye, was probably capable of conveying double the number of persons which it now contained.|$|E

40|$|Aim: The aim is {{to recycle}} mercury from dental amalgam scrap using the vacuum {{distillation}} method. Materials and Methods: A total of 150 g of dental amalgam scrap was taken in a <b>round</b> <b>bottom</b> flask and was subjected to vacuum distillation at 398 °C. The vapor of mercury was collected in another <b>round</b> <b>bottom</b> flask. Observation: The procedure is carried out for mercury recovery using vacuum distillation apparatus, and mercury vapor are collected in a <b>round</b> <b>bottom</b> flask, and the silver is recovered using sucrose as reducing agent. Using 150 g of dental amalgam scrap 50 %– 80 % of silver are recovered, and silver has a purity of 70 %– 80 %. However, the total time required in the reduction process ranged between 303 and 600 min. Conclusion: Mercury could be recycled from dental amalgam scrap through vacuum distillation method at 398 °C and its implication of dental amalgam scrap in an Indian perspective...|$|R
