Of the variety of methods employed, the method of calibration due to Careyfoster is the best.

40|$|The low {{density and}} high {{relative}} strength of Mg alloys means they can offer engineering benefits over steels or Al alloys. However, the susceptibility of Mg alloys to corrosion has limited their exploitation and restricted their use to more benign environments. An Mg-Al intermetallic surface layer {{is a good}} candidate for a robust corrosion protection method. This work demonstrates their development by using a novel ionic liquid electroplating process to deposit Al on to Mg substrates that when heat treated diffuses to form discrete intermetallic layers. Examination of three Mg-Al-Zn alloys showed that the amount Mg-Al intermetallic phases in their microstructures was linked to the quantity of Al they contained. Subsequent self-corrosion measurements using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy demonstrated that their performance was connected to the amount of intermetallic present, and in particular the strength of the micro-galvanic couples generated between the anodic and cathodic phases. Measurements of the self-corrosion behaviour of manufactured samples of the Mg-Al intermetallics confirmed that they could provide significant improvements, but it was acknowledged that their noble nature compared to an Mg substrate would encourage galvanic corrosion if a surface layer was damaged. As such the galvanic activity of the Mg-Al-Zn alloys and Mg-Al intermetallics was compared against a pure Mg standard using zero resistance ammetry and the <b>resistance</b> <b>box</b> technique. Galvanic models of alloy self-corrosion and a damaged intermetallic surface layer were also used to assess the potential problem. These measurements demonstrated that the intermetallics could act as strong cathodes, but further discussion {{on the nature of the}} behaviour suggested means by which galvanic corrosion might self-limit or self-repair. The galvanic corrosion experiments also revealed how the combination of current flow and a solution saturated with Mg 2 + ions could lead to the formation of a highly protective Mg(OH) 2 film with promising characteristics...|$|E

Fragments of up to 16 amino acid residues were inserted into FhuA and used to determine FhuA active sites and FhuA topology {{in the outer}} membrane. For this purpose antibiotic <b>resistance</b> <b>boxes</b> flanked by symmetric polylinkers were inserted into fhuA and subsequently partially deleted. Additional in-frame insertions were generated by mutagenesis with transposon Tn 1725. The 68 FhuA protein derivatives examined contained segments of 4, 8, 12, 16, and 22 additional amino acid residues at 34 different locations from residues 5 to 646 of the mature protein. Most of the FhuA derivatives were found in normal amounts in the outer membrane fraction. Half of these were fully active toward all ligands, demonstrating proper insertion into the outer membrane. Seven of the 12 - and 16 -amino-acid-insertion derivatives (at residues 378, 402, 405, 415, 417, 456, and 646) were active toward all of the ligands and could be cleaved by subtilisin in whole cells, suggesting a surface location of the extra loops at sites which did not affect FhuA function. Two mutants were sensitive to subtilisin (insertions at residues 511 and 321) but displayed a strongly reduced sensitivity to colicin M and to phages phi 80 and T 1. Four of the insertion derivatives (at residues 162, 223, 369, and 531) were cleaved only in spheroplasts and probably form loops at the periplasmic side of the outer membrane. The number and size of the proteolytic fragments indicate cleavage at or close to the sites of insertion, which has been proved for five insertions by amino acid sequencing. Most mutants with functional defects were affected in their sensitivity to all ligands, yet frequently to different degrees. Some mutants showed a specifically altered sensitivity to a few ligands; for example, mutant 511 - 04 was partially resistant only to colicin M, mutant 241 - 04 was reduced in ferrichrome and albomycin uptake and showed a reduced colicin M sensitivity, and mutant 321 - 04 was fully resistant to phage T 1 and partially resistant to phage phi 80. The altered residues define preferential binding sites for these ligands. Insertions of 4 to 16 residues at positions 69, 70, 402, 530, 564, and 572 resulted in strongly reduced amounts of FhuA in the outer membrane fraction, varying in function from fully active to inactive. These results provide the basis for a model of FhuA organization in the outer membrane...|$|R

However, when high amount of this ion is found in water, it has negative effects on human health; so it needs to be treated.   World’s Health Organization (WHO) and Turkish Standards Institution 266 have been limited fluoride consantration with 1. 5 mg/L. In this case, to control fluoride at the drinking water sources, some treatment methods have been developed over the history. Chemicel precipitation, adsorption, coagulation-flocculation, ion exchange, membrane processes are some of these treatment methods. At the beginning of twenty first century, there was a big need to develeop a new technology for especially to treat micropollutants but also can be used for the conventional pollutants. At this point electrooxidation and electrocoagulation processes are investigated because of their advantages according to the other treatment options. Electrocoagulation process {{is one of the}} electrochemical methods that has been developed for water and wastewater treatment in recent years. It is an easy and effective method for the removal of organic and inorganic pollutants. Treatment of wastewater and wash water by electrocoagulation has been practiced for most of the 20 th century with increasing popularity. In the last decade, this technology has been increasingly used in the United States, South America and Europe and also Turkey for treatment of industrial wastewater containing metals. It has also been noted that in North America electrocoagulation has been used primarily to treat wastewater from pulp and paper industries, mining and metal-processing industries. In addition, electrocoagulation has been applied to treat water containing foodstuff waste, oil wastes, dyes, marinas, public transit, wash water, ink, suspended particles, chemical and mechanical polishing waste, organic matter from landfill leachates,defluorination of water, synthetic detergent effluents, and solutions containing heavy metals.   In its simplest form, an electrocoagulation reactor is made up of an electrolytic cell with one anode and one cathode. When connected to an external power source, the anode material will electrochemically corrode due to oxidation, while the cathode will be subjected to passivation. An electrocoagulation system essentially consists of pairs of conductive metal plates in parallel, which act as monopolar electrodes. It furthermore requires a direct current power source, a <b>resistance</b> <b>box</b> to regulate the current density and a multimeter to read the current values. The conductive metal plates are commonly known as "sacrificial electrodes. " The sacrificial anode lowers the dissolution potential of the anode and minimizes the passivation of the cathode. The sacrificial anodes and cathodes can be of the same or of different materials. The arrangement of monopolar electrodes with cells in series is electrically similar to a single cell with many electrodes and interconnections. In series cell arrangement, a higher potential difference is required for a given current to flow because the cells connected in series have higher resistance. The same current would, however, flow through all the electrodes. On the other hand, in parallel or bipolar arrangement the electric current is divided between all the electrodes in relation to the resistance of the individual cells, and each face on the electrode has a different polarity. During electrolysis, the positive side undergoes anodic reactions, while on the negative side, cathodic reactions are encountered. Consumable metal plates, such as iron oraluminum, are usually used as sacrificial electrodes to continuously produce ions in the water. The released ions neutralize the charges of the particles and thereby initiate coagulation. The released ions remove undesirable contaminants either by chemical reaction and precipitation, or by causing the colloidal materials to coalesce, which can then be removed by flotation. In addition, as water containing colloidal particulates, oils, or other contaminants move through the applied electric field, there may be ionization, electrolysis, hydrolysis, and free-radical formation which can alter the physical and chemical properties of water and contaminants. As a result, the reactive and excited state causes contaminants to be released from the water and destroyed or made less soluble. In this study, experimental work was carried out about the removal of fluoride for which electrocoagulation method was applied to the samples of synthetic solution containing fluoride using steel electrodes. In the first part; the meaning, importance, purpose and scope of the study were stated. In the second part, properties, usage areas and sources of fluoride were explained. In this part, it was mentioned about the effect of fluoride on human health and some researchs made about water containing fluoride in Turkey. Drinking water standards according to Turkish Standards Institution 266 and World Health Organization and fluoride standards set by different corporations were demonstrated.   Methods for the removal of fluoride from water were mentioned and examples from the applications in literature were given. Definition of electrocoagulation, factors affecting this process and mechanism for removal of fluoride with this process were stated, applications about this process found in literature were evaluated.   In the third part, outline of experimental work was given and optimum conditions for the removal of fluoride ion from drinking water by electrocoagulation method using steel electrodes were stated. First part {{of the study was to}} determine current density effect on electrocoagulation process. The effects of current density on electrocoagulation process is determined by the interval of   0. 75 – 15. 16 mA/cm 2 current density. It is observed that optimum current density was 3. 79 mA/cm 2 and experiments are carried out with this value of current density. Then, electrolyte type and concentration effect is observed. NaCl and KCl electrolytes were used and determined that NaCl is more effective than KCl as an electrolyte on flüoride removal by electrocoagulation process. Beginning concentration of fluoride is effective on removing fluoride with electrocogulation. At this point, to evaluate the effect of  beginning concentration of fluoride on electrocoagulation, 2 – 5 mg/L fluoride containing samples are prepared and experiments are performed. With 3. 79 mA/cm 2 applied current density and 2 and 3 mg/L fluoride concentration, at the end of 240 minutes electrocoagulation, results showed that 1. 5 mg/L fluoride standards were achieved. To investigate pH effect on fluoride removal by electrocoagulation, pH level is changed between 3 and 6. pH 3 was the most effective pH value as an starting pH of fluoride removal by electrocoagulation. In this study, steel electrodes are used as electrodes of electrocoagulation process for the removal of fluoride and with the beginning of 5 mg/L fluoride concentration, 50 mg/L NaCl concentration, 3. 79 mA/cm 2 current density and starting pH value as 3 is observed as the optimum conditon. In the last part of this sudy, discussion, comments and suggestions were stated. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|E

Elevated expression of both FOXM 1 and MTDH is known to be a consequence of both activating mutations in oncogenes such as PI 3 K, Ras, myc and loss of function mutations in tumor suppressor genes such as p 53 and PTEN in various types of cancers including HCC. The role of FOXM 1 and MTDH as potential prognostic markers as well as therapeutic targets in HCC will be discussed. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs), endogenous small non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression, are involved in HCC and interact with both FOXM 1 and MTDH in several ways. Thus, altered expression of miRNAs in HCCs will also be discussed as potential tools for diagnosis, prognosis and therapy in HCC...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} suitable processing conditions for semi-solid aluminium 7075 thermal analysis (TA) was performed {{in order to obtain}} the relationship between fraction solid and temperature. During experimental work, the alloy was heated to 750 °C by <b>resistance</b> heated <b>box</b> furnace and solidified at various cooling rates. Cooling curves for the metal were recorded with two thermocouples, one at the centre of the melt volume and one beside the containing crucible wall. A specially designed chamber with kaowool blanket was used to achieve the slowest cooling rate. The faster cooling rate was achieved with the crucible in open atmosphere with a set air flow rate over the crucible. A Data Acquisition (DAQ) system controlled by LabVIEW software was used to record the temperature-time profiles. From these cooling curves, the phase change at any corresponding time and temperature was estimated. The temperature difference between centre and wall of crucible was used to determine dendritic coherency point (DCP). Results show that, the slowest cooling rate with the kaowool blanket was at 0. 03 °C/s. An intermediate cooling rate of 0. 21 °C/s was achieved by leaving the melt to cool without kaowool blanket or forced air flow, and the fastest cooling rate was 0. 43 °C/s. The change in cooling rate altered the temperatures at which phase changes occurred, including those for eutectic and solidus. It was found that for lower the cooling rates that the DCP occurred at lower temperatures. The DCP for the cooling rate of 0. 03 °C/s was found to be 574 °C (corresponding to 0. 85 fraction solid) whereas the DCP for 0. 43 °C/s was found to be 623 °C (corresponding to 0. 55 fraction solid) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of ground return current in fault occurrence {{plays a key}} role in the dimensioning of the earthing grid of substations and of cable sealing end compounds, in the computation of rise of earth potential at substation sites and in electromagnetic interference (EMI) on neighbouring parallel metallic conductors (pipes, handrails, etc.). Moreover, the ground return current evaluation is also important in steady-state regime since this stray current can be responsible for EMI and also for alternating current (AC) corrosion. In fault situations and under some assumptions, the ground return current value at a substation site can be computed by means of k-factors. The paper shows that these simplified and approximated approaches have a lot of limitations and only multiconductor analysis can show the ground return current behaviour along the cable (not only the two end values) both in steady-state regime and in short circuit occurrence (e. g., phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase-to-ground). Multiconductor cell analysis (MCA) considers the cable system in its real asymmetry without simplified and approximated hypotheses. The sensitivity of ground return current on circuit parameters (cross-bonding <b>box</b> <b>resistances,</b> substation earthing resistances, soil resistivity) is presented in the paper...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} empirical {{results of}} cable noise reduction techniques {{as demonstrated in}} a TEM cell operating with radiated fields from 2 - 200 MHz. It is {{the first part of}} a two-paper series. This first paper discusses cable types and shield connections. In the second paper, the effects of load and source resistances and chassis connections are examined. For each topic, well established theories are compared to data from a real-world physical system. Finally, recommendations for minimizing cable susceptibility (and thus cable emissions) are presented. There are numerous papers and textbooks that present theoretical analyses of cable noise reduction techniques. However, empirical data is often targeted to low frequencies (e. g. 100 MHz). Additionally, a comprehensive study showing the relative effects of various noise reduction techniques is needed. These include the use of dedicated return wires, twisted wiring, cable shielding, shield connections, changing load or source impedances, and implementing load- or source-to-chassis isolation. We have created an experimental setup that emulates a real-world electrical system, while still allowing us to independently vary a host of parameters. The goal of the experiment was to determine the relative effectiveness of various noise reduction techniques when the cable is in the presence of radiated emissions from 2 MHz to 200 MHz. The electronic system (Fig. 1) consisted of two Hammond shielded electrical enclosures, one containing the source resistance, and the other containing the load <b>resistance.</b> The <b>boxes</b> were mounted on a large aluminium plate acting as the chassis. Cables connecting the two boxes measured 81 cm in length and were attached to the boxes using standard D 38999 military-style connectors. The test setup is shown in Fig. 2. Electromagnetic fields were created using an HP 8657 B signal generator, MiniCircuits ZHL- 42 W-SMA amplifier, and an EMCO 5103 TEM cell. Measurements were taken using an Agilent E 4401 B spectrum analyzer and HP 1141 a differential probes...|$|R
40|$|The Italian orange fruit export {{development}} outside EU {{countries has}} required commercial agreements regarding the restriction of parasites spread especially Mediterranean fruit fly. The correct use of cold treatment during the shipment {{is used to}} satisfy this requirement. This paper reports {{the results of a}} simulated refrigerated transport of citrus fruits (14600 kg of ‘Tarocco’ oranges) in a 40 ft refrigerated container. Temperatures have been monitored inside the refrigerated container in different positions of the load (in the air, in the pallet and in the fruits) using 40 innovative direct-to-digital temperature probes. Moreover, an innovative package (with an increased vented surface) was compared to the standard boxes. Results show that the difference of average temperature between the temperature probes in head space was less than 0. 5 °C. Temperature peaks showed the on/off cycle of the automatic defrosting system. Though temperature probes placed on the floor showed a good homogeneity, the air temperature reached a minimum level of about - 0. 8 °C, near the cold air outlet, which is considered too low for the oranges cold storage. The vented boxes allowed a more rapid cooling, lowering the overall thermal <b>resistance</b> of fruit <b>boxes,</b> and so making fruits mostly affected by the cold air temperature near the air cooler outlet...|$|R
40|$|Striga is a {{parasitic}} weed {{that causes}} devastation to several crops in Africa. Different species of striga attack different crops the species of striga which parasitizes {{maize and sorghum}} IS different from that which attacks cowpea. Seeds of striga are stimulated to germinate by substances that are given off by the cowpea roots. The parasite then attaches itself to the cowpea roots and absorbs nutrients needed by the cowpea, resulting in a sickly plant and a poor crop. Strains of cowpea that are resistant to striga {{have been found in}} Botswana and plant breeders have crossed them with higher yielding varieties to produce good, resistant varieties, suitable for growing in most of Africa. The striga seed still germinates but is unable to attach itself to the cowpea root and therefore dies. This reduces the reservoir of striga seed in the soil and the cowpea crop is unaffected.

40|$|Piping {{is one of}} the {{possible}} failure mechanism for dams and levees with a sandy foundation. Water flowing through the foundation causes the onset of grain transport, due to which shallow pipes are formed at the interface of the sandy layer and an impermeable blanket layer. In the past, the mechanism has been investigated predominantly in densely packed sands, in which the process was observed to start at the downstream side (backward erosion). Recently performed experiments in loose sand (van Beek et al. 2009) showed a different failure mechanism (forward erosion). In this article additional experiments of piping in loose sands are described for investigating the relevance of the forward process for practice. In these experiments the type of process was found to be dependent on the presence of shear <b>resistance</b> between sand <b>box</b> cover and top sand grains, that causes grains to be fixed geometrically. Without this shear resistance the process was found to be forward, whereas with this shear resistance the process was found to be backward oriented. The change in degree of fixity and relative density as a result of loading is investigated with electrical density measurements. The experiments show that the forward process is not relevant for levees in practice, in which the cohesive blanket layer causes the sand grains to be fixed properly...|$|R
30|$|A potentiodynamic {{polarization}} {{test was}} performed on an electrochemical analyzer (CHI 800, Chenhua, China). Electrochemical experiment {{was carried out in}} a 3.5  wt% NaCl aqueous solution by using a classic three-electrode configuration, which consisted of a working electrode (sample, 1  cm 2), a counter electrode (platinum), and a reference one (saturated calomel electrode). During the potentiodynamic sweep experiment, the sample was first immersed in the electrolyte solution for 30  min to stabilize the open circuit potential (E 0). Tafel plot was transformed from the recorded data, and the corrosion current density (icorr) was determined by extrapolating the straight-line section of the anodic and cathodic Tafel lines. The experiment sweeping rate was 5  mV/s and was performed at 25  °C. The micro-hardnesses of the magnesium alloy with various composite coatings were evaluated by using a HXD- 1000 micro-hardness tester with a Vicker indenter at a load of 100  g and durable time of 15  s. Thermal shock test was carried out to evaluate the adhesion of coatings [23]. It was described as follows: in an air atmosphere, the Mg substrate with Ni-P coating or Ni-P-Al 2 O 3 coating was placed in a high-temperature <b>box</b> <b>resistance</b> furnace and heated to 250 [*]±[*] 10  °C by a heating rate of 20  °C min− 1 then quenched in a cold water.
