5|$|Inuyama castle (犬山城 Inuyama-jō) {{is located}} in the {{southern}} coast of Kiso river in the city of Inuyama, in Aichi Prefecture. In 1537, Oda Nobunaga's uncle, Oda Nobuyasu strengthened the castle. Inuyama castle is claimed to be one of Japan's oldest castles and one of the castles that managed to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> original structure.|$|E
5|$|It was {{recognized}} that fighter escort was inherently desirable, {{but no one}} could quite conceive how a small fighter could have the range of the bomber yet <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> combat maneuverability. Failure to see this issue through proved one of the Air Corps Tactical School's major shortcomings.|$|E
5|$|A Bug's Life grossed {{approximately}} $33,258,052 on {{its opening}} weekend, ranking number 1 for that weekend. It managed to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> number 1 spot for two weeks. The film grossed $162.8million in its United States theatrical run, covering its estimated production costs of $120million. The film made $200,460,294 in foreign countries, pushing its worldwide gross to $363.3million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation's Antz.|$|E

5|$|During this period, Luxembourg {{was allowed}} to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> own {{government}} and political system, but all proceedings were overshadowed by the German army's presence. Despite the overbearing distraction of the occupation, the Luxembourgish people attempted to lead their lives as normally as possible. The political parties attempted to focus on other matters, such as the economy, education, and constitutional reform.|$|E
5|$|Early reviews {{praised the}} style of Carnivàle but {{questioned}} the approach and execution of the story. Its first episode set a new audience record for an HBO original series, {{but was unable to}} <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> ratings in its second season. It was canceled after 24 episodes, cutting its intended six-season run short by four seasons. It won five Emmys out of fifteen nominations in 2004, and received numerous other nominations and awards between 2004 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|It {{stipulated that}} Hong Kong would <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> laws and be {{guaranteed}} {{a high degree}} of autonomy for at least 50 years after the transfer. The Hong Kong Basic Law, based on English law, would serve as the constitutional document after the transfer. It was ratified in 1990. The expiry of the 1898 lease on the New Territories in 1997 created problems for business contracts, property leases and confidence among foreign investors.|$|E

5|$|Natural England's role is {{to advise}} and help the owners manage Whitton Bridge Pasture effectively. To achieve this Natural England {{provides}} guidelines for each SSSI. Species-rich grassland, such as that found at Whitton Bridge, requires careful management for it to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> high species diversity. This means many activities are not allowed at the site including: ploughing, drainage {{and the use of}} fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides.|$|E
5|$|On June 13, 2016, Microsoft {{announced}} it planned {{to acquire the}} professional networking site LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, {{to be completed by}} the end of 2016. The acquisition would keep LinkedIn as a distinct brand and <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> current CEO, Jeff Weiner, who will subsequently report to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. The acquisition was completed on December 8, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The ROCOR, {{forced to}} leave Yugoslavia {{toward the end of}} World War II, {{eventually}} established its base of operations in New York City. In 1946, it was decided at the 7th All-American Sobor that the Metropolia would sever its ties with the ROCOR and attempt to return to the Patriarchate of Moscow. This return was proposed with the stipulation that the Metropolia be allowed to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> autonomy. When this condition was not met, the Metropolia continued as a self-governing Church.|$|E

5|$|The vacant {{property}} was later purchased {{for use by}} a lawyer and then by an auto dealer before being purchased by Joseph Baptista in 2000. Baptista had to survey the ground {{to ensure that the}} gas tanks had been removed. Since 2000, Baptista's mortgage finance company Anchor Financial has operated out of the location and the building has continued to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> historic features.|$|E
5|$|After his {{conquest of}} Bulgaria, Basil II {{prevented}} revolts and discontent by retaining {{the rule of}} the local nobility and by relieving the newly conquered lands of the obligation to pay taxes in gold, allowing them to be paid in kind instead. He also allowed the Bulgarian Patriarchate to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> autocephalous status and all its dioceses, but reduced it to an archbishopric. After his death Byzantine domestic policies changed and a series of unsuccessful rebellions broke out, the largest being led by Peter Delyan. In 1185 Asen dynasty nobles Ivan Asen I and Peter IV organised a major uprising which resulted in the re-establishment of the Bulgarian state. Ivan Asen and Peter laid the foundations of the Second Bulgarian Empire with Tarnovo as the capital.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, diplomats, and administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

5|$|In Bottomley's absence, {{his office}} {{explored}} {{the issue and}} resolved that Rhodesia could <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> representative in South Africa, but {{should not be allowed}} to appoint another in Lisbon; a consul was acceptable, they concluded, but only as part of the British Embassy staff. Bottomley remained unaware of this progress until a call from his office on 25 June, whereupon he still did nothing. Unwilling to wait, Rhodesia confirmed Reedman's appointment the next day, much to Wilson's fury. Only now was Bottomley finally jolted into action; he informed Salisbury of his ministry's findings on 29 June, offering them the consul within the embassy, but refusing to sanction an independent office.|$|E
5|$|In Lenin's absence, Stalin {{had begun}} {{consolidating}} his power both by appointing his supporters to prominent positions, and by cultivating {{an image of}} himself as Lenin's closest intimate and deserving successor. In December 1922, Stalin took responsibility for Lenin's regimen, being tasked by the Politburo with controlling who had access to him. Lenin was increasingly critical of Stalin; while Lenin was insisting that the state should <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> monopoly on international trade during mid-1922, Stalin was leading other Bolsheviks in unsuccessfully opposing this. There were personal arguments between the two as well; Stalin had upset Krupskaya by shouting at her during a phone conversation, which in turn greatly angered Lenin, who sent Stalin a letter expressing his annoyance.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} institutions, the Parliament's seat {{was not yet}} fixed. The {{provisional}} arrangements placed Parliament in Strasbourg, while the Commission and Council had their seats in Brussels. In 1985 the Parliament, wishing {{to be closer to}} these institutions, built a second chamber in Brussels and moved some of its work there despite protests from some states. A final agreement was eventually reached by the European Council in 1992. It stated the Parliament would <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> formal seat in Strasbourg, where twelve sessions a year would be held, but with all other parliamentary activity in Brussels. This two-seat arrangement was contested by the Parliament, but was later enshrined in the Treaty of Amsterdam. To this day the institution's locations are a source of contention.|$|E

5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous {{as a special}} administrative region {{and be able to}} <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in international organisations (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty arrangements and policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|Halban's {{heavy water}} team from France {{continued}} its slow neutron research at Cambridge University; but {{the project was}} given a low priority since it was not considered relevant to bomb making. It suddenly acquired military significance when it was realised that it provided the route to plutonium. The British Government wanted the Cambridge team to be relocated to North America, in proximity to the raw materials it required, and where the American research was being done. But Sir John Anderson wanted the British team to <b>retain</b> <b>its</b> own identity, and was concerned that since the Americans were working on nuclear reactor designs using nuclear graphite as a neutron moderator instead of heavy water, that team might not receive {{a fair share of}} resources. The Americans had their own concerns, particularly about security, since only one of the six senior scientists in the group was British. They also had concerns about patent rights; that the French team would attempt to patent nuclear technology based on the pre-war work. As a compromise, Thomson suggested relocating the team to Canada.|$|E
