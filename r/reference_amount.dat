50|$|PAM was {{introduced}} in 1961 by Leon Rubin who, with Arthur Meyerhoff, started Gibraltar Industries to market the spray. The name PAM is an acronym for Product of Arthur Meyerhoff. In 1971, Gilbraltar Industries merged with American Home Products (now Wyeth) and {{became part of the}} Boyle-Midway portfolio. When Reckitt & Colman (now Reckitt Benckiser) acquired Boyle-Midway from American Home Products in 1990, PAM became part of the American Home Foods subsidiary. In 1996, AHF was acquired by Hicks, Muse, Tate and Furst Inc., and C. Dean Metropoulos and Company from American Home Products, becoming International Home Foods, which in turn was acquired by ConAgra in 2000. PAM is marketed in various flavors, such as butter and olive oil, meant to impart the flavor of cooking with those ingredients. Flavors such as lemon or garlic are also offered. PAM also markets high-temperature sprays formulated for use when grilling etc., and one containing flour suitable for dry-cooking as in baking. PAM is marketed as a nominally zero-calorie alternative to other oils used as lubricants when using cooking methods such as sauteing or baking (US regulations allow food products to claim to be zero-calorie if they contain fewer than 5 calories per <b>Reference</b> <b>Amount</b> Customarily Consumed and per labeled serving.) Similar sprays are offered by other manufacturers.|$|E
5000|$|This method can be {{used for}} any {{biological}} molecule in principle and is not restricted to serum antigens, nor is it required to use the indirect method of measuring the free antigen instead of directly measuring the captured antigen. For example, if it is undesirable or not possible to radiolabel the antigen or target molecule of interest,a RIA can be done if two different antibodies that recognize the target are available and the target is large enough (e.g., a protein) to present multiple epitopes to the antibodies. One antibody would be radiolabeled as above while the other would remain unmodified. The RIA would begin with the [...] "cold" [...] unlabeled antibody being allowed to interact and bind to the target molecule in solution. Preferably, this unlabeled antibody is immobilized in some way, such as coupled to an agarose bead, coated to a surface, etc. Next, the [...] "hot" [...] radiolabeled antibody is allowed to interact with the first antibody-target molecule complex. After extensive washing, the direct amount of radioactive antibody bound is measured and the amount of target molecule quantified by comparing it to a <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> assayed at the same time. This method is similar in principle to the non-radioactive sandwich ELISA method.|$|E
40|$|Private forest {{managers}} often seek {{guidelines on}} how much dead wood should be retained in streams in order to adequately fulfill ecosystem functions. There are three approaches to answering this question for a particular reach of channel. The first approach uses an understanding of ecologic functions of dead wood in streams to determine the amount needed to fulfill ecologic and geomorphic functions. This approach fails because the complexities of sizes, shapes, and arrangements of dead wood {{in a variety of}} lotic ecosystems overwhelm any scientific specification of target loadings. Another approach uses reference loadings to evaluate departures in amounts of dead wood in streams from <b>reference</b> <b>amounts</b> in unaltered systems. A precise threshold cannot be defined using this approach because dead wood volumes are highly variable, even within pristine channels in similar settings, and distributions for managed and pristine channels overlap. A third approach constructs a wood budget by evaluating past, present, and projected supplies in streams and riparian areas. This is a cumulative-effects analysis that shifts the focus from channels to riparian forests. In combination, the three approaches provide the best information to determine how much wood is enough, but they do not offer simple, formulaic prescriptions. The demands for performing the necessary analyses before harvesting riparian wood suggest that management of riparian forests will continue to be guided most often by general prescriptions...|$|R

Parents, clinicians, communities, state and federal authorities and political leaders are expected to monitor blood lead test levels, aware that children testing higher than the reference level are testing higher than 97.5% of all US children. The CDC expects action to be taken when test levels are found to exceed the reference. As blood lead levels slowly decline in response to such action, the reference will also decline. CDC will recalculate a new reference every four years.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The {{research}} question {{addressed in this}} paper is how different reference amounts utilised in front of package nutrition labelling influence evaluation of product healthfulness. SUBJECTS/METHODS: A total of 13, 117 participants from six European countries (Germany, UK, Spain, France, Poland and Sweden) were recruited via online panels. A mixed between/within-subject factorial design was employed with food (biscuits, sandwiches, yogurts), healthfulness and presence of Guideline Daily Amounts as within-subjects factors and <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> ('per 100 g', 'typical portion', 'half portion') and country as between-subjects factors. RESULTS: Overall, people correctly ranked foods according to their objective healthfulness as defined by risk nutrients alone, and could distinguish between more and less healthful variants of foods. General healthfulness associations with the three product categories {{do not appear to}} have had a strong influence on product ratings. This study shows that where the <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> of 'per 100 g' {{is very different from the}} 'typical' portion size, as was the case for biscuits, products with a 'per 100 g' label are rated significantly less healthful than the 'typical' or 'half typical' portions. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that across the three food categories, consumers do factor the <b>reference</b> <b>amount,</b> that is, the quantity of food for which the nutritional information is being presented, into their judgements of healthfulness. Therefore, appropriate reference amounts are also of importance for the effective presentation of nutritional information...|$|E
40|$|The {{majority}} of decision-related {{research has focused}} on how the brain computes decisions over outcomes that are positive in expectation. However, much less is known about how the brain integrates information when all possible outcomes in a decision are negative. To study decision-making over negative outcomes, we used fMRI along with a task in which participants had to accept or reject 50 / 50 lotteries that could result in more or fewer electric shocks compared to a <b>reference</b> <b>amount.</b> We hypothesized that behaviorally, participants would treat fewer shocks from the <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> as a gain, and more shocks from the <b>reference</b> <b>amount</b> as a loss. Furthermore, we hypothesized that this would be reflected by a greater BOLD response to the prospect of fewer shocks in regions typically associated with gain, including the ventral striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The behavioral data suggest that participants in our study viewed all outcomes as losses, despite our attempt to induce a status quo. We find that the ventral striatum showed an increase in BOLD response to better potential gambles (i. e. fewer expected shocks). This lends evidence to the idea that the ventral striatum is not solely responsible for reward processing but that it might also signal the relative value of an expected outcome or action, regardless of whether the outcome is entirely appetitive or aversive. We also find a greater response to worse gambles in regions previously associated with aversive valuation, suggesting an opposing but simultaneous valuation signal to that conveyed by the striatum...|$|E
