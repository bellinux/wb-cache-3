500|$|Korketrekkeren (direct translation: [...] "The Corkscrew") is a tobogganing {{track and}} former {{bobsleigh}} and luge track in Oslo, Norway. The tobogganing track runs between Frognerseteren and Midtstuen and is operated {{as a public}} venue by the municipality. <b>Return</b> <b>transport</b> {{to the top of}} the hill is undertaken by riding the Oslo Metro's Holmenkollen Line. Tobogganing in the area started in the 1880s, with several roads being used during winter evenings. Auto racing took place in the hill in 1921 and the following year it saw its first luge tournament. The first major tournament was the FIL European Luge Championships 1937. Tobagganing also took place in the nearby Heftyebakken, but from 1950 Korketrekkeren became the sole tobogganing hill and Heftyebakken was used for cross-country skiing.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} {{transporting}} patients or elderly people {{has been widely}} studied in literature and is usually modeled as a dial-a-ride problem (DARP). In this paper we analyze the corresponding problem arising in the daily operation of the Austrian Red Cross. This nongovernmental organization is the largest organization performing patient transportation in Austria. The aim is to design vehicle routes to serve partially dynamic transportation requests using a fixed vehicle fleet. Each request requires transportation from a patient's home location to a hospital (outbound request) or back {{home from the hospital}} (inbound request). Some of these requests are known in advance. Some requests are dynamic {{in the sense that they}} appear during the day without any prior information. Finally, some inbound requests are stochastic. More precisely, with a certain probability each outbound request causes a corresponding inbound request on the same day. Some stochastic information about these <b>return</b> <b>transports</b> is available from historical data. The purpose of this study is to investigate, whether using this information in designing the routes has a significant positive effect on the solution quality. The problem is modeled as a dynamic stochastic dial-a-ride problem with expected <b>return</b> <b>transports.</b> We propose four different modifications of metaheuristic solution approaches for this problem. In detail, we test dynamic versions of variable neighborhood search (VNS) and stochastic VNS (S-VNS) as well as modified versions of the multiple plan approach (MPA) and the multiple scenario approach (MSA). Tests are performed using 12 sets of test instances based on a real road network. Various demand scenarios are generated based on the available real data. Results show that using the stochastic information on <b>return</b> <b>transports</b> leads to average improvements of around 15 %. Moreover, improvements of up to 41 % can be achieved for some test instances...|$|R

40|$|HIV/AIDS test {{laboratories}} in South Africa face {{growing demand}} for high quality, timely and efficient testing of blood samples in all regions of the country, however rural. The three main tests for HIV/AIDS, namely CD 4, HIV Viral Load and Infant PCR, are provided in a hierarchy of levels: CD 4 is the most frequently-needed test, with most laboratory coverage needed. HIV Viral Load is less frequently called for, and Infant PCR is the rarest test to be done, with correspondingly fewest laboratories needed. The National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS) of South Africa operates an inbound hub network for collection of blood samples and transfer to laboratories equipped {{to carry out the}} required tests: test results are transmitted electronically, so there is no outbound or <b>return</b> <b>transport.</b> This paper describes the development of modelling carried out over several years of collaboration with NHLS to advise decision makers on an appropriate and efficient hub network.

40|$|The Atlantic meridional {{overturning}} circulation (MOC) plays {{a critical}} role in the climate system and is responsible for much of the heat transported by the ocean. A mooring array, nomianally at 26 ^ between the Bahamas and the Canary Islands, deployed in Apr 2004 provides continuous measurements of the strength and variability of this circulation. With seven full years of measurements, we now examine the interannual variability of the MOC. While earlier results highlighted substantial seasonal and shorter timescale variability, there had not been significant interannual variability. The mean MOC from 1 Apr 2004 to the 31 March 2009 was 18. 5 Sv with the annual means having a standard deviation of only 1. 0 Sv. From 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, the annually averaged MOC strength was just 12. 8 Sv, representing a 30 % decline. This downturn persisted from early 2009 to mid- 2010. We show that the cause of the decline was not only an anomalous wind-driven event from Dec 2009 [...] Mar 2010 but also a strengthening of the geostrophic flow. In particular, the southward flow in the top 1100 m intensified, while the deep southward <b>return</b> <b>transport</b> [...] -particularly in the deepest layer from 3000 [...] 5000 m [...] -weakened.

30|$|According to Behrends (2011 : 34), the {{implementation}} {{problems of the}} CCFT system are often attributed to both technological and organizational complexity of this transport mode. Thus, the additional expenses in the transport organization, which should be overcome by the decision to select this transport mode, can {{be considered to be}} a barrier to modal shift. Because of the diversity of actors, each of whom organizes and controls part of the transport chain, the level of complexity in the CCFT system is higher than in unimodal transport modes (Bontekoning et al. 2004). In the CCFT system, the following components can be distinguished: pre- and post-carriage by the road transport (collection and distribution from shippers to receivers), the exchange of loading units at the intermodal (rail/road) terminals and the rail line hauling (main haul) (Janic 2008). In contrast to studies that investigate shippers as decision makers in the transport mode choice, the present study focuses on freight forwarders. The decision to concentrate on forwarders was based on the following reasons. With an increasing tendency to outsource, companies delegate transport organization and mode decisions to third parties who make it possible to benefit from the forwarder’s knowledge and skills of the specific transport market (Bergantino and Bolis 2004). Regardless whether the forwarder’s disposition form is self-fulfilling or subcontracting, an adaptation in the organizational routine maybe necessary for CCFT to be considered to be a transport mode option. In the event that a forwarder decides to use CCFT, he must organize the transport chain, which consists of the pre- and post-carriage and main haul, and he must work together with the actors in the particular subsystems (road hauler, intermodal transport operator, intermodal terminal provider) (Ishfaq and Sox 2010). Depending on the current disposition form, specific barriers for the decision to use a CCFT system can arise. However, in both cases, the contractual agreements with other forwarders or road haulers are necessary to organize the post-carriage of transport (Chiara et al. 2008). In addition, the issue of how to organize the <b>return</b> <b>transport</b> of the disposed semi-trailer must be addressed. Particularly in cases of transport subcontracting, additional barriers may occur. If the forwarder decides to dispose the semi-trailer in the CCFT by keeping the contract with the current road hauler, the road hauler must change his business model and shift from long distance operations to operations in the pre- or post-carriage. Consequently, in contrast to RFT, the forwarder in the CCFT system must take control over the semi-trailer of the road hauler to ensure the post-carriage and <b>return</b> <b>transport</b> while also considering the business interests of the partner in the business model change. The demonstrated changes in the set of organizational routines that are required for the shift from RFT to CCFT can result in additional expenses for the transport organization, thus becoming a potential barrier to the modal shift. This is especially true in the case of transport subcontracting where the willingness to shift to combined transport maybe lower than in the case where the forwarder has his own fleet. In the following, the theoretical underpinnings that explain the expected forwarder’s behavior are developed.|$|E
