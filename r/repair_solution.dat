In 1987 she was re-sold and moved to Immingham for refurbishment. Her sponsons and funnel were removed and crankshaft cut to reduce her width and enable her to be pulled into Alexandra Dock at {{what was to be}} her last port of call. Re-assembled and refitted and her faulty boiler removed, she opened as a bar and restaurant in 1989 alongside the National Fishing Heritage Centre and Sainsbury's flagship branch on Grimsby's historic original Haven Alexandra Dock, Grimsby, close to the retired fishing trawler Ross Tiger. Thinning of her hull due to corrosion and pinhole seepage through some of her bottom plates led to her being taken out of public use in 2006, a move considered to be only temporary while repairs were conducted. The hull plates were considered to be defective ( [...] and thus requiring attention) over 15 percent of the submerged hull of the ship and impossible to replace in-situ. To remedy this would either require the ship‘s removal to a dry dock, or a partial or complete lining of the lower hull of the vessel with concrete (a recognised <b>repair</b> <b>solution</b> for long term static steel ships which had already been used on the Lincoln Castle‘s half sister Wingfield Castle).

One key BISR component is the repair analysis al-gorithm (RA) used to replace faulty memory cells with redundant ones.

How-ever, existing RAs for block-based memories suffer from lower repair effectiveness than some of the algorithms for traditional memories. Moreover, none of them guarantees finding an optimal memory <b>repair</b> <b>solution.</b> In this work, a new RA for block-based bit-oriented RAMs is proposed and verified by software simulations. The experimental results indicate that the new algorithm is suitable for use in SoCs. For certain memory parameters (size, the numbers of spares and quadrants, fault distri-bution), it is more effective than the most effective known RA for such memories by up to 4 %. Furthermore, the additional on-chip algorithm area is within acceptable lev-els in comparison to similar RA for traditional memories.

We provide impossibility results concerning truthful mechanisms for robust solutions with bounded social-welfare losses in which the bid-taker cannot rescind items from winning bidders to repair a solution. We also show that this result extends to combinatorial auctions that include a form of leveledcommitment contract.
