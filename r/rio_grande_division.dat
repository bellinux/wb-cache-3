40|$|The Southern Pacific Railroad Company {{arrived in}} El Paso laying rails {{from the west}} in May 1881 {{in its attempt to}} {{complete}} the second transcontinental railroad route. East of El Paso, construction was handled by a Texas company, the Galveston, Harrisburg, and San Antonio line. Joining the GH 2 ̆ 6 SA and the Texas 2 ̆ 6 New Orleans line, the route became known as the Sunset Route. In 1924, the Southern Pacific System acquired the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, known best for providing transportation for the coal and copper industries in the Southwest. The <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> <b>Division</b> of the Southern Pacific Company included railway lines north and west of El Paso as far west as Arizona and as far north as Tucumcari, New Mexico. Other lines absorbed into this division include El Paso and Northeastern, Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railroad, El Paso and Rock Island and Arizona and New Mexico Railway Company. This collection was donated to the C. L. Sonnichsen Special Collections Department of the University of Texas at El Paso Library in 1969. Offices or subsidiary companies that generated the records include: Arizona 2 ̆ 6 New Mexico Railway Company; General Auditor’s Department; El Paso Legal Department; General Claims Agent’s Office; General Freight and Passenger Agent’s Office; Land and Tax Agent’s Office; El Paso Operating Department (Maintenance of Way); and The Pullman Company. Correspondence, ledgers, contracts, legal files, court cases, financial records, maintenance records, maps, plans, and incidental photographs reflect the activities of the El Paso and Southwestern Railroad, Southern Pacific within the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> <b>Division,</b> and certain predecessor or subsidiary lines including El Paso Northern Railway, El Paso and Northeastern Railroad, Arizona and New Mexico Railway, El Paso and Rock Island Railroad, Burro Mountain Railroad Company, Dawson Railway and Coal Company, El Paso Southern Railway Company, and Alamogordo and Sacramento Mountain Railroad. Major correspondents include Charles B. Eddy, William A. Hawkins, and John Franklin. Topics include railroad construction, water resources, Bonito Dam, railroad operation and maintenance, Mexican bracero workers, railroad-related lawsuits. The collection also includes source material on the coal, copper, cattle, and timber industries in the Southwest...|$|E

50|$|Between Salt Lake City and Provo {{the former}} Utah Southern line ran roughly {{parallel}} to the Denver and <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Western's Utah <b>Division.</b> Between these cities, the former Utah Southern route became mostly unused for through traffic after the two companies began sharing track in the 1980s. This portion was later abandoned {{and the right of}} way sold to the Utah Transit Authority. The portion of the UTA owned right of way that has been rebuilt provides the corridor for {{a significant part of the}} TRAX light rail system, forming almost the entirety of the corridor of the Blue Line. Freight traffic on this portion is now managed by the Salt Lake City Southern Railroad.|$|R
5000|$|The Portuguese {{deployed}} two army divisions {{near the}} border with the Banda Oriental in <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> do Sul. One division, commanded by Field Marshal Manuel Marques de Sousa, camped {{in the hills of}} Bagé. It consisted of one infantry battalion from the town of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande,</b> two squadrons of light cavalry, four cavalry squadrons from the Legion of São Paulo (a militia unit) and one squadron of mounted militiamen (also from the town of <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande).</b> The other <b>division</b> was stationed in {{what became known as the}} São Diogo camp (at the shore of River Ibirapuitã) and was commanded by Field Marshal Joaquim Xavier Curado (later Count of São João das Duas Barras). The second division comprised two infantry battalions, two horse artillery batteries from the Legion of São Paulo, one regiment of dragoons, one squadron of mounted militiamen from the town of Rio Pardo and one company of Guarani lancers. The two divisions were under the command of Diogo de Sousa (who had been promoted to Field Marshal), and together they formed the [...] "Pacifying Army of the Banda Oriental" [...] with a total of 3,000 men.

50|$|From 1967 to 1969, SR-176 {{started at}} an {{intersection}} with SR-171 in South Salt Lake {{only about a}} block east of I-15 and proceeded straight north as a four-lane (plus, as of 2012, a center turn lane) road without continuous sidewalks (300 West continues south of this point before swerving east to avoid crossing the FrontRunner and Union Pacific railroad corridor (<b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> Utah <b>Division</b> during the 1960s) at an acute angle and connects to a short frontage road of 3900 South, but was never a state highway). The road runs {{down the middle of}} an isolated strip of land cut off from its surroundings by I-15 on the west and the TRAX light rail line (previously Union Pacific's mainline to Provo) on the east; the freeway is always between a block and two blocks to the west and the rail line is exactly a block to the east. The area is occupied almost totally by industrial and specialized wholesale businesses that benefit from relatively easy access to the freeway (and, in some cases, the railroad's freight service) without suffering from the difficulty in access from surrounding neighborhoods.|$|R

50|$|Because of the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande's</b> {{frequent}} {{floods and}} droughts, {{the sharing of}} its water between the US and Mexico has been a contentious issue since the 1800s. The 1906 Treaty for Equitable Distribution of the Waters of the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> enabled the construction of Elephant Butte Dam, the first major <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> dam, in New Mexico. While this benefited water users along the middle <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> it did little to help the lower <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> Valley, where water flows remained uncontrolled. The 1944 Treaty relating to the utilization of waters of the Colorado and Tijuana Rivers and of the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande</b> authorized the IBWC to build dams on the uncontrolled border segment of the <b>Rio</b> <b>Grande.</b> The first dam to be completed under the treaty was Falcon Dam in 1953.|$|R
