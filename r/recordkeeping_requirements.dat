40|$|A new {{law allows}} you to choose to deduct certain {{charitable}} contributions of money on your 2009 tax return instead of your 2010 return. The contributions must have been made after January 11, 2010, and before March 1, 2010, for the relief of victims in areas affected by the January 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti. Contributions of money include contributions made by cash, check, money order, credit card, charge card, debit card, or via cell phone. The new law was enacted after the 2009 forms, instructions, and publications had already been printed. When preparing your 2009 tax return, you may complete the forms as if these contributions were made on December 31, 2009, instead of in 2010. To deduct your charitable contributions, you must itemize deductions on Schedule A (Form 1040) or Schedule A (Form 1040 NR). The contribution {{must be made to}} a qualified organization and meet all other requirements for charitable contribution deductions. However, if you made the contribution by phone or text message, a telephone bill showing the name of the donee organization, the date of the contribution, and the amount of the contribution will satisfy the <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>requirement.</b> Therefore, for example, if you made a $ 10 charitable contribution by text message that was charged to your telephone or wireless account, a bill from your telecommunications company containing this information satisfies the <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>requirement...</b>|$|R

[...] Indeed, the U.S. Department of Justice had so advised the Alabama Department of Corrections. [...] Furthermore, Fifth Circuit precedent that was binding {{on the state of}} Alabamaforbidding [...] "handcuffing inmates to the fence and to cells for long periods of time, and forcing inmates to stand, sit, or lie on crates, stumps, or otherwise maintain awkward positions for prolonged periods"should have notified the guards that using the hitching post violated the Eighth Amendment. [...] Finally, an Alabama Department of Corrections regulation required guards to maintain a log of the inmate's needs for water and bathroom breaks while tied to the hitching post, and required the guards to release the inmate if he told them he was ready to return to work. [...] However, evidence in this case showed that the guards did not maintain such a log during the June incident, and evidence in a related case showed that Alabama prison guards routinely disregarded the regulation's <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>requirement</b> and release conditions.

5000|$|In {{light of}} these deficiencies, Thomas {{concluded}} that it was [...] "far from obvious" [...] that the actions of these three guards violated the Eighth Amendment. The question Thomas asked was whether in 1995 {{it was obvious that}} the [...] "mere act of cuffing petitioner to the restraining bar... violated the Eighth Amendment." [...] In Thomas's view, no prior litigation involving Alabama's use of the restraining bar would have put a reasonable prison guard on notice that the mere act of attaching a prisoner to it would violate the Eighth Amendment. The three federal district courts in Alabama had all rejected this contention, as well as the idea endorsed by the majority - that exposure to the elements resulting from an extended stay on the hitching post, coupled with the pain caused by the handcuffed - was the wanton and unnecessary infliction of pain. Hope did not allege that the mere act of attaching him to the restraining bar [...] "imposed a substantial risk of serious harm upon him". Nor was it, in light of the district courts' conclusion, [...] "obvious" [...] that this act would have caused Hope harm. There was no evidence that these particular guards had read the Department of Justice's report. The Alabama Department of Corrections's regulation specifically authorized guards to use the restraining bar when inmates were disruptive to the work squad. The fact that the guards did not comply with the <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>requirement</b> of the regulation was beside the point, Justice Thomas believed, because Hope never alleged that the guards' failure to do so caused the Eighth Amendment violation. Thomas also read binding Fifth and Eleventh Circuit precedent merely to prohibit [...] "malicious and sadistic" [...] conduct by guards. While handcuffing prisoners to fences for [...] "long periods of time" [...] could be considered malicious and sadistic under these binding precedents, it was not clear to Justice Thomas whether 7 hours counted as a [...] "long period of time" [...] under this precedent. Finally, [...] "deliberate indifference" [...] means that the prison official knew of and then disregarded an excessive risk to health and safety, and {{there was no evidence that}} these guards knew that merely attaching Hope to the restraining bar posed such a risk.|$|R

50|$|The RCM is an {{abstract}} conceptual model {{that helps to}} understand and explore recordkeeping activities (as interaction) in relation to multiple contexts over space and time (spacetime). Recordkeeping activities take place from before the records are created by identifying <b>recordkeeping</b> <b>requirements</b> in policies, systems, organizations, processes, laws, social mandates that impact on what is created {{and how it is}} managed over spacetime. In a continuum, recordkeeping processes, such as adding metadata, fix documents {{so that they can be}} managed as evidence. Those records deemed as having continuing value are retained and managed as an archive. The implication of an RCM approach to records and archives is that systems and processes can be designed and put in place before records are even created. A continuum approach therefore highlights that records are both current and archival at the point of creation.|$|E

The BSA was amended to allow the designated officer or agency who receives suspicious transaction reports to notify U.S. intelligence agencies. It also addresses issues of record keeping and reporting by making it easier to undertake the reporting of suspicious transactions; by making it a requirement that financial institutions report suspicious transactions; through the creation of anti-money laundering programs and by better defining anti-money laundering strategy; and by making it a requirement that anyone who does business file a report for any coin and foreign currency receipts that are over US$10,000.

40|$|Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a {{class of}} organic {{chemicals}} that had become widely used in industrial applications due to their practical physical and chemical properties. Historical uses of PCBs include dielectric fluids (used in utility transformers, capacitors, etc.), hydraulic fluids, and other applications requiring stable, fire-retardant materials. Due to findings that PCBs may cause adverse health effects and due to their persistence and accumulation in the environment, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), enacted on October 11, 1976, banned the manufacture of PCBs after 1978 [Section 6 (e) ]. The first PCB regulations, promulgated at 40 CFR Part 761, were finalized on February 17, 1978. These PCB regulations include requirements specifying disposal methods and marking (labeling) procedures, and controlling PCB use. To assist the Department of Energy (DOE) {{in its efforts to}} comply with the TSCA statute and implementing regulations, the Office of Environmental Guidance has prepared the document ``Guidance on the Management of Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs). `` That document explains the requirements specified in the statute and regulations for managing PCBs including PCB use, storage, transport, and disposal.
