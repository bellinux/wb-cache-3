During testing at the Nardò Ring in Italy one XJ220 had its catalytic converters removed and its <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> increased to 7,900rpm; these subtle modifications increased the car's power output by 50bhp, and the car was then driven by 1990 Le Mans Winner Martin Brundle to {{a top speed of}} 217.1miles per hour owing to the circular nature of the track, some (including the British car magazines Top Gear and Autocar) say a speed of [...] is equivalent to [...] on a straight, level road.

2500|$|During the [...] {{season of}} Formula One, the sport was gripped in a {{governance}} crisis. The FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost cutting measures {{for the following}} season, including an optional budget cap for the teams; teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings and an engine not subject to a <b>rev</b> <b>limiter.</b> The Formula One Teams Association (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA. However, talks broke down and FOTA teams announced, {{with the exception of}} Williams and Force India, that 'they had no choice' but to form a breakaway championship series.|$|E

50|$|NASCAR {{does not}} allow the use of pit road {{specific}} <b>rev</b> <b>limiters</b> as found in most other forms of racing. Allowing a pit road limiter would require the addition of several electronic components into the car, and NASCAR has long opposed the installation of electronics into cars, citing the decline of open wheel racing once technology was introduced.|$|R

Popular engines include the pushrod hemi headed Toyota 2T, the {{crossflow}} Ford Kent, and Holden Gemini, but the most common is the Volkswagen Golf. The Volkswagen Golf is popular due to its lighter weight and greater power levels. AF2 engines must use carburetors for fuel induction, with most running Weber carburetors. AF2 engines are now limited to 8500 rpm although in the past prior to the introduction of <b>rev</b> <b>limiters,</b> engine <b>revs</b> over 10,000 rpm were not uncommon.

25|$|In {{an attempt}} to curb the {{increasing}} engine power levels of recent years, the maximum engine displacement was reduced from 3.0 to 2.4 litres {{and the number of}} cylinders from 10 to 8. At similar engine speeds, the change was expected to cut peak power by around 200bhp, which would equate to around three to five seconds on lap times at most circuits. (Scuderia Toro Rosso continued to use 3.0 litre 10-cylinder engines with both <b>rev</b> and air-intake <b>limiters</b> to avoid the costs of re-engineering their cars in a short period). Initial testing indicated the new engines were six seconds slower than their V10 counterparts, but early in the season it became obvious that despite the decrease in power, lap times were not far from 2005 figures; on some circuits, the fastest laps set this year were actually faster than the ones recorded last year, with the V10 engines.|$|R
50|$|After a seven-minute break, {{the second}} part of the {{qualifying}} session got underway. With just a second covering the fifteen remaining drivers, many drivers set their quickest laps in the final few minutes of the session. As the session ended, the Ferrari of Massa, who was sixth at the time, was involved in a serious accident at turn four. Replays showed debris striking his Schuberth helmet, 1 inch above the left eye, when he was travelling at 162 mph. The impact knocked him unconscious, with his car straying towards the grass verge on the inside of turn four. The onboard footage from his car showed that he had his feet on both the accelerator and the brake pedals. The Ferrari decelerated at a force of between 0.6 and 1.4g and impacted with the barrier at 62 mph. After the car imbedded itself in the tyre barrier, the engine could be heard still <b>revving</b> on the <b>limiter,</b> indicating that Massa's foot was still pressing the accelerator and that he was thus unconscious. This accident came just six days after FIA Formula Two Championship driver Henry Surtees was fatally injured after being struck on the head by a wheel bouncing across the circuit at the Brands Hatch track in the United Kingdom, and provoked some discussion about the safety of open cockpit racing cars. The debris, a spring from the rear suspension damper (weighing around 800 grams), was suspected of having come from the car of Barrichello, who had reported that something had come loose minutes beforehand. Brawn confirmed the part had indeed come from Barrichello's car, and changed the same part on team-mate Button's car ahead of the race. It was also subjected to an inspection during the third qualifying session, leaving Button with only one run for qualifying, due to the lengthy inspection.|$|R

Initial cars were equipped with an electrical <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> which came into effect at 6,150 rpm. With the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> disabled, the engine was reputed to pull in excess of 7,000 rpm, even in fourth gear.

Despite its increased torque, the 3.8 liter LTZ demonstrated slightly worse performance due to its lowered horsepower, with 0-60 mph (0-100 km/h) times of 7.5 seconds (as opposed to 7.2 for the LQ1) and 1/4 mile (~400 m) times of 15.7 seconds (as opposed to 15.5 for the LQ1). The car has a computer-limited top speed of 107 mi/h km/h and the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> kicks in at 5800 rpm for the 3.8L (<b>Rev</b> <b>limiter</b> is at 7000 rpm for the 3.4L LQ1).|$|E
50|$|Moving the gear-stick over to {{the right}} allowed manual {{selection}} of 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th gear using up and down shift actions. The manumatic feature would hold the gear up to the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> as a manual transmission would.|$|E
5000|$|In motor {{vehicles}} automatic transmissions will change gear {{to prevent the}} engine from turning too quickly. Additionally, almost all modern vehicles are fitted with an electronic <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> device that will cut fuel supply or sparks to the engine to prevent overspeed.|$|E
50|$|It {{also means}} that the torque and power curves of the engine are unusual. The engine {{produces}} peak torque and almost maximum power at a relatively low RPM, {{and from there to}} the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> the torque drops and the power does not increase much.|$|E
50|$|The {{top speed}} of the Panigale R was {{estimated}} by Road & Track to be 202 mph with the track only Termignoni exhaust system it ships with, which they apparently derived from {{the speed at which}} the bike hits the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter,</b> assuming nominal gearing and wheel size.|$|E
50|$|The initial {{high speed}} runs, {{with the car}} {{configured}} in production specification (catalytic converters connected, lower rev-limit of 7400rpm) achieved a maximum recorded speed of 212.3 mph, the same speed as previously reached at Fort Stockton during testing.

50|$|Engines with hydraulictappets (such as the Buick/RoverV8) {{often have}} {{in effect a}} <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> {{by virtue of their}} design. Thetappet {{clearances}} are maintained by the flow of the engine's lubricating oil.At high engine speeds, the oil pressure rises {{to such an extent that}} thetappets 'pump up', causing valve float. This sharply reduces engine power,causing speed to drop.|$|E
50|$|The RS gauges {{feature a}} digital {{instrument}} panel {{that gives the}} rider a variety of information.

50|$|The lesser funded teams (the former Minardi team spends {{less than}} 50 million, while Ferrari spent {{hundreds}} of millions of euros a year developing their car) had the option of keeping the current V10 for another season, but with a <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> to keep them competitive with the most powerful V8 engines. The only team to take this option was the Toro Rosso team, which was the reformed and regrouped Minardi.|$|E
50|$|Modifications {{allowed to}} the engine are; {{changing}} the injectors or modifying {{them to be able}} to run methanol fuel, relocating the throttle body from the rear of the engine to the top of the plenum chamber, using custom built extractor type exhaust manifolds and finally modifying the computer chip to run a maximum <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> of 6000 rpm and tuning the fuel maps to suit the new extractors and the methanol fuel.|$|E
50|$|At {{this stage}} of the race, Maldonado, Alonso or Räikkönen looked to be the only drivers with a {{realistic}} chance of winning the Grand Prix. Webber, after his front wing replacement, was stuck behind Nico Hülkenberg in the second Force India and could not find enough straight line speed to pass him under DRS. Many cars hit the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> down the front straight early and relied on delayed braking to complete a pass.|$|E
50|$|A {{change was}} made to the drop gear ratio {{compared}} to the previous year's event, where cars were reaching the <b>rev</b> <b>limiter</b> on the main straight. The ratio change was aimed {{to reduce the amount}} of time that cars spent on the limiter, lessening the risk of damage to the drivetrain. Overtaking at the first corner was made easier, as the top speed of the cars on the main straight was no longer restricted by the limiter.|$|E
