5|$|At Whitsun in 1189, Coutances was {{a member}} of a {{commission}} appointed by the papal legate John of Anagni to arbitrate the dispute between King Henry II of England and his son, <b>Richard,</b> who was supported by King Philip II of France. Henry and Richard's conflict stemmed from Richard's desire to secure his inheritance to the throne of England, which he believed his father was trying to give to his youngest brother, John. The commission met near Le Mans. <b>Richard</b> and Philip insisted that <b>Richard</b> should be married to Philip's sister Alice, that Henry name <b>Richard</b> as Henry's heir, and that Richard's youngest brother John should go on crusade with <b>Richard.</b> Henry rejected those terms, and neither Philip nor <b>Richard</b> would negotiate, even under the legate's threat of an interdict on France.|$|E
5|$|During the 13th century, a folktale {{developed}} in which Richard’s minstrel Blondel roamed (singing a song {{known only to}} him and <b>Richard)</b> to find Richard's prison. This story was the foundation of André Ernest Modeste Grétry's opera <b>Richard</b> Coeur-de-Lion, and inspired the opening of <b>Richard</b> Thorpe's film version of Ivanhoe. Sixteenth-century tales of Robin Hood began describing him as a contemporary (and supporter) of <b>Richard</b> the Lionheart; Robin became an outlaw {{during the reign of}} Richard's evil brother, John, while <b>Richard</b> was fighting in the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Of {{particular}} emphasis was the children's fascination with Maurice <b>Richard.</b> Montreal's star player from 1942 until 1960, <b>Richard</b> was a prolific goal scorer. In the 1944–45 season– {{one year before}} the events of The Hockey Sweater– <b>Richard</b> became the first player in National Hockey League history to score 50 goals in a 50-game season. <b>Richard</b> attended the 1980 premiere of The Sweater in Montreal, and according to Carrier, was moved to tears by the film. <b>Richard</b> also requested copies {{so that he could}} show it to his own children.|$|E

5|$|<b>Richard</b> began {{discussions about}} a {{potential}} alliance with Philip II in Paris during 1187, {{and the next}} year <b>Richard</b> gave homage to Philip in exchange for support for a war against Henry. <b>Richard</b> and Philip fought a joint campaign against Henry, and by the summer of 1189 the king made peace, promising <b>Richard</b> the succession.

5|$|Richard's time as {{archbishop}} {{was much}} less stormy than Becket's had been, {{and he seems to}} have had better relations with the king. <b>Richard</b> attended the royal councils, and more than once was with the king in Normandy. <b>Richard</b> was less dogmatic {{on the rights of the}} clergy than his great predecessor had been; but his compromises were regarded by the monastic writers and the followers of Becket as a sign of weakness. Pope Alexander III took <b>Richard</b> to task when <b>Richard</b> acquiesced in the election of bishops taking place in the royal chapel. As part of his diplomatic efforts on the king's behalf, <b>Richard</b> escorted Henry's daughter Joan to Provence on her journey in 1176 to marry King William II of Sicily. <b>Richard</b> also spent part of 1177 in Flanders on diplomatic business for King Henry.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between Henry and <b>Richard</b> finally dissolved into violence shortly before Henry's death.

5|$|After {{the death}} of Henry II, and the {{accession}} of <b>Richard</b> as king, the monks of Christ Church Priory petitioned <b>Richard</b> to intercede in the long-running dispute {{between them and the}} archbishop. In November 1189, <b>Richard</b> and the whole court, including the Queen Mother Eleanor of Aquitaine, travelled to Canterbury in an attempt to end the controversy before the papacy become involved. <b>Richard</b> finally settled the dispute by persuading Baldwin to abandon his church-building project and to dismiss Norreys. Soon after this, <b>Richard</b> left England and Baldwin declared {{that he was going to}} found the proposed church at Lambeth, and then join <b>Richard</b> on crusade. Both <b>Richard</b> and Baldwin agreed to appoint Norreys to Evesham Abbey, as the previous abbot of Evesham, Adam of Evesham, had recently died. This appointment eventually led, after Baldwin's death, to the Case of Evesham. In August 1189 Baldwin objected to the marriage of Prince John, later King John, to Isabel of Gloucester, on the grounds of consanguinity. John promised to obtain a papal dispensation, but never did so. Baldwin laid John's lands under interdict, but it was lifted by a papal legate who declared the marriage legal. <b>Richard</b> also restored to the archbishops of Canterbury the right to operate a mint, staffed by three moneyers.|$|E

At Ivan's barbecue, <b>Richards</b> sees Summer Day, an acquaintance upon whom he once had a crush. Encouraged by Quaid, <b>Richards</b> approaches her, and they embrace. <b>Richards</b> and Day go off into the woods on their own and have sex, though <b>Richards</b> later denies to Quaid that they had sex. The next day, <b>Richards</b> and Day go swimming. Quaid teases <b>Richards</b> about going into the water with his glasses on, and <b>Richards</b> removes his glasses, which leaves his vision blurred and unfocused.

5|$|After {{the revolt}} ended in 1174, {{relations}} between HenryII {{and his sons}} continued to be strained.

In June that year <b>Richard</b> travelled to Paris with PhilipII and struck up a friendship with the French king.
