5|$|Adolf Hitler, {{after an}} {{unsuccessful}} attempt {{to overthrow the}} German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933. He abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive <b>rearmament</b> campaign. Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the Territory of the Saar Basin was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his <b>rearmament</b> programme, and introduced conscription.|$|E
5|$|By early 1934, {{the focus}} {{shifted away from}} funding work {{creation}} schemes and toward <b>rearmament.</b> By 1935, military expenditures accounted for 73 percent of the government's purchases of goods and services. On 18 October 1936, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, intended {{to speed up the}} <b>rearmament</b> programme. In addition to calling for the rapid construction of steel mills, synthetic rubber plants and other factories, Göring instituted wage and price controls and restricted the issuance of stock dividends. Large expenditures were made on <b>rearmament</b> in spite of growing deficits. With the introduction of compulsory military service in 1935, the Reichswehr, which had been limited to 100,000 by the terms of the Versailles Treaty, expanded to 750,000 on active service at the start of World War II, with a million more in the reserve. By January 1939, unemployment was down to 301,800 and it dropped to only 77,500 by September.|$|E
5|$|Defence {{spending}} {{had been}} heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets. By 1935, {{faced with a}} resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership (see German re-armament), he was convinced {{of the need for}} <b>rearmament.</b> Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the Royal Air Force, realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the English Channel, was no defence against air power.|$|E
5|$|During {{a cabinet}} meeting in September 1936, Göring and Hitler {{announced}} that the German <b>rearmament</b> programme must be sped up. On 18 October, Hitler named Göring as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan to undertake this task. Göring created a new organisation to administer the Plan and drew the ministries of labour and agriculture under its umbrella. He bypassed the economics ministry in his policy-making decisions, {{to the chagrin of}} Hjalmar Schacht, the minister in charge. Huge expenditures were made on <b>rearmament,</b> in spite of growing deficits. Schacht resigned on 8 December 1937, and Walther Funk took over the position, as well as control of the Reichsbank. In this way, both of these institutions were brought under Göring's control {{under the auspices of the}} Four Year Plan. In July 1937, the Reichswerke Hermann Göring was established under state ownership – though led by Göring – with the aim of boosting steel production beyond the level which private enterprise could economically provide.|$|E
5|$|German {{submarine}} U-105 was a Type IXB U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. She {{was ordered}} in May 1938 {{as part of}} Germany's naval <b>rearmament</b> program. Her keel was laid down in Bremen in November 1938. After roughly seven months of construction, she was launched in June 1940 and formally commissioned into the Kriegsmarine in September 1940.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, the US {{worked for the}} <b>rearmament</b> of West Germany and, in 1955, secured its full {{membership}} of NATO. In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO.|$|E
5|$|The British, with no army in {{the field}} and behind in <b>rearmament,</b> was in no {{position}} to challenge French strategy, which had assumed the prominent role of the Western Alliance. Having little ability to oppose the French, the British strategy for military action {{came in the form of}} strategic bombing of the Ruhr industry.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} veterans' organisations, HIAG campaigned for the {{immediate}} amnesty and early release of war criminals still in Allied captivity. This issue was significant, as most of these organisations made their cooperation {{in the area of}} <b>rearmament</b> contingent on the satisfactory resolution in this area. It was partly for this reason that the West German government was sympathetic to the fate of these individuals and made every effort to secure their early release. Chancellor Adenauer even met with Kurt Meyer in Werl Prison when he went there on an inspection tour.|$|E
5|$|Decisions {{made during}} the next two days had a {{dramatic}} impact on the experience of Air Group 18 at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. TG 38.1 was detached and sent to Ulithi for replenishment and <b>rearmament</b> after two weeks of continuous operations against Okinawa and the Ryukyus Islands. USS Bunker Hill and Hancock were also detached from TG 38.2 at this time, leaving Intrepid the sole Essex-class aircraft carrier in its group. When Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force was sighted entering the Sibuyan Sea on October 24, the only task group readily available to strike was the shorthanded TG 38.2.|$|E
5|$|Druid was {{the last}} ship to be built at Deptford Dockyard. The ship was {{initially}} assigned to the Cape of Good Hope Station, where she remained {{for two years before}} being transferred to the North America and West Indies Station. Druid was refitted upon her return home in December 1876, which included <b>rearmament.</b> The ship recommissioned in February 1879 and returned to the North American Station. She returned home in September 1882 and was paid off. Druid was laid up in the Medway until she was sold for scrap in 1886.|$|E
5|$|German {{submarine}} U-104 was a Type IXB U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine during World War II. She {{was ordered}} by the Kriegsmarine on 24 May 1938 {{as part of the}} German naval <b>rearmament</b> program Plan Z. Her keel was laid down by DeSchiMAG AG Weser in Bremen in November 1939. Following about six and a half months of construction, she was launched in May 1940 and formally commissioned into the Kriegsmarine in August 1940.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, the Eyalet of Egypt, a {{province}} of the Ottoman Empire, ordered several ironclad warships for its fleet {{as part of a}} <b>rearmament</b> program to again challenge the power of the central governmentthe last having been the Second Egyptian–Ottoman War twenty years earlier. These included the two Asar-i Şevket-class vessels, ordered in 1866. After lengthy negotiations, the crisis was resolved when the Egyptian ironclads, including Asar-i Şevket and Necm-i Şevket, were transferred to the central government on 29 August 1868, among other concessions made by Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{opposed the}} {{building}} of the hydrogen bomb and the <b>rearmament</b> of Germany, which were policies encouraged by the assumptions of NSC-68. During the Korean War (which began when North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950), when rumors started circulating in the State Department that plans were being made to advance beyond the 38th parallel into North Korea, an act that Kennan considered dangerous, he engaged in intense arguments with Assistant Secretary of State for the Far East Dean Rusk, who apparently endorsed Acheson's goal to forcibly unite the Koreas.|$|E
5|$|The Balkan {{crisis that}} started with the Serbo-Bulgarian War, coupled with Ottoman naval {{expansion}} in the 1860s and 1870s, prompted the Greek Navy to begin a <b>rearmament</b> program. In addition, the Greek fleet had proved to be too weak to effectively challenge Ottoman naval power during the 1866 Cretan Revolt. In 1885, Greece ordered three new ironclads of the Hydra class. The ships were ordered from the Graville and St. Nazaire shipyards in France during the premiership of Charilaos Trikoupis.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi Party led by Adolf Hitler won {{the special}} federal {{election}} of 1932. After {{a series of}} unsuccessful cabinets, Hindenburg appointed Hitler as Chancellor of Germany on 30 January 1933. After the Reichstag fire, a decree abrogated basic civil rights and within weeks the first Nazi concentration camp at Dachau opened. The Enabling Act of 1933 gave Hitler unrestricted legislative power; subsequently, his government established a centralised totalitarian state, withdrew from the League of Nations following a national referendum, and began military <b>rearmament.</b>|$|E
5|$|The two Scharnhorst-class battleships {{were the}} first capital ships built for the Kriegsmarine {{after the end of}} World War I. They marked the {{beginning}} of German naval <b>rearmament</b> after the Treaty of Versailles. The class comprised two vessels: Scharnhorst and Gneisenau. The ships were armed with nine 28cm (11in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets, though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38cm (15in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets.|$|E
5|$|While her {{half-sister}} , normally flagship of the Channel Squadron, was refitting in 1873–75, Agincourt, {{normally the}} flagship {{of the fleet}} second-in-command, replaced her as flagship and Northumberland became flagship of the second-in-command until Minotaurs return to duty. She served as the flagship for Rear Admirals George Hancock and Lord John Hay. Northumberland received her own refit and <b>rearmament</b> from 1875–79 and rejoined the Channel Squadron upon its completion. The ship was paid off in 1885 for another refit and became the flagship of Vice Admirals Sir William Hewett and John Baird, successive commanders of the Channel Squadron, upon her completion in 1887.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European <b>rearmament</b> from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent fall in the yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E
5|$|German {{submarine}} U-30 was a Type VIIA U-boat of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine {{that served}} during World War II. She was ordered in April 1935 {{in violation of}} the Treaty of Versailles, which prevented the construction and commissioning of any U-boats for the German navy, and as part of the German naval <b>rearmament</b> program known as Plan Z. She sank the liner , the first ship sunk in World War II, on 3 September 1939, under the command of Fritz-Julius Lemp. She was retired from front-line service in September 1940 after undertaking eight war patrols, having sunk 17 vessels and damaging two others. U-30 then served in a training role {{until the end of the}} war when she was scuttled. She was later raised and broken up for scrap in 1948.|$|E
5|$|Luna {{resigned}} on 1 March, {{mainly in}} resentment for the <b>rearmament</b> of the Kawit Battalion as the Presidential Guard. Aguinaldo hesitantly accepted the resignation. As a result, Luna was {{absent from the}} field for three weeks, during which the Filipino forces suffered several defeats and setbacks. One such defeat {{would be at the}} Battle of Marilao River on 27 March. Receiving the depressing reports from the field through his La Independencia correspondents, Luna went to Aguinaldo and asked to be reinstated with more powers over all the military heads, and Aguinaldo promoted him to Lieutenant General and agreed making him Commander-in-Chief of all the Filipino forces in Central Luzon (Bulacan, Tarlac, Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bataan, Zambales).|$|E
5|$|Up to {{this point}} the Redman {{investment}} {{had not been a}} notable success: in the decade to 1934, despite an additional capital injection by Churchill, the business had made losses in half of the years, and in only one of the other years had it made any more than a modest profit. However, growth was steady after 1934, with profits of £23,000, £38,000, £54,000 and then a large jump to £139,000 in 1938. By 1939 the Redman operation alone employed 300 people, compared to around 30 in 1920. Motor industry expansion assisted in this growth, with Ford becoming a customer and Gabriel setting up a new machine tool division at Coventry Road, South Yardley, Birmingham, in 1938 to give easy access for the industry's centre, but <b>rearmament</b> was the most significant factor.|$|E
5|$|A further {{delay in}} {{construction}} {{was announced in}} 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government <b>rearmament</b> drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 {{at a cost of}} £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.|$|E
5|$|After {{his return}} to Parliament in 1922, Lansbury was denied office in the brief Labour {{government}} of 1924, although he served as First Commissioner of Works in the Labour government of 1929–31. After {{the political and economic}} crisis of August 1931, Lansbury did not follow his leader, Ramsay MacDonald, into the National Government, but remained with the Labour Party. As the most senior of the small contingent of Labour MPs that survived the 1931 general election, Lansbury became the Leader of the Labour Party. His pacifism and his opposition to <b>rearmament</b> in the face of rising European fascism put him at odds with his party, and when his position was rejected at the 1935 Labour Party conference, he resigned the leadership. He spent his final years travelling through the United States and Europe in the cause of peace and disarmament.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} February 1933, Hitler {{announced}} that <b>rearmament</b> must be undertaken, albeit clandestinely at first, as {{to do so}} was {{in violation of the}} Versailles Treaty. A year later he told his military leaders that 1942 was the target date for going to war in the east. He pulled Germany out of the League of Nations in 1933, claiming its disarmament clauses were unfair as they applied only to Germany. The Saarland, which had been placed under League of Nations supervision for 15 years at the end of World War I, voted in January 1935 to become part of Germany. In March 1935, Hitler announced that the Reichswehr would be increased to 550,000 men and that he was creating an air force. Britain agreed that the Germans would be allowed to build a naval fleet with the signing of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement on 18 June 1935.|$|E
5|$|Burgess, now a major general, also {{implemented}} a <b>rearmament</b> program {{in response to}} increased aggression by the Japanese Empire in China and {{made a number of}} recommendations to the New Zealand government. Some recommendations, such as the purchase of aircraft (which led to the establishment of the Royal New Zealand Air Force) and artillery for harbour defences, were enacted. Others, such as the proposal for an infantry battalion and artillery battery be formed for service in British India, were not. He was also an advocate for the mechanisation of the New Zealand Military Forces. He was made a Knight Bachelor in 1934, and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1935, the same year his term as Commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces was extended for two years. In 1935, he was also awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.|$|E
5|$|Hitler sought Lebensraum ("living space") for the German {{people in}} Eastern Europe and his {{aggressive}} {{foreign policy is}} considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. He directed large-scale <b>rearmament</b> and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland, resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany. In June 1941, Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. By the end of 1941, German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In December 1941, he formally declared war on the United States, bringing them directly into the conflict. Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats. In {{the final days of the}} war during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, he married his long-time lover Eva Braun. Less than two days later on 30 April 1945, the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Soviet Red Army and their corpses were burned.|$|E
5|$|Hughes, in {{his speech}} at the opening session of the conference on November 12, 1921, made the American proposal—the U.S would {{decommission}} or not build 30 warships if Great Britain did the same for 19 vessels, and Japan 17 ships. The secretary was generally successful, and agreements were reached on this and other points, including settlements to disputes over islands in the Pacific, and limitations {{on the use of}} poison gas. The naval agreement was limited to battleships and to some extent aircraft carriers, and in the end did not prevent <b>rearmament.</b> Nevertheless, Harding and Hughes were widely applauded in the press for their work. Harding had appointed Senator Lodge and the Senate Minority Leader, Alabama's Oscar Underwood, to the U.S. delegation; they helped ensure that the treaties made it through the Senate mostly unscathed, though that body added reservations to some of the treaties.|$|E
5|$|In August 1934, Hitler {{appointed}} Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics, and in {{the following}} year, as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war. Reconstruction and <b>rearmament</b> were financed through Mefo bills, printing money, and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State, including Jews. Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936. Hitler oversaw {{one of the largest}} infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history, leading to the construction of dams, autobahns, railroads, and other civil works. Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic, while the cost of living increased by 25 percent. The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy; by 1939, the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week.|$|E
5|$|Newall was {{promoted}} to air commodore on 1 January 1925, and took command of the newly formed Auxiliary Air Force in May 1925. He was appointed to a League of Nations disarmament committee in December 1925 and then became Deputy Chief of the Air Staff and Director of Operations and Intelligence on 12 April 1926. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the 1929 Birthday Honours and, having been promoted to air vice marshal on 1 January 1930, he stood down as Deputy Chief on 6 February 1931. He became Air Officer Commanding Wessex Bombing Area in February 1931 and then Air Officer Commanding Middle East Command in September 1931. He {{then returned to the}} Air Ministry, where he became Air Member for Supply and Organisation on 14 January 1935, during the beginnings of the pre-war expansion and <b>rearmament.</b> He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1935 Birthday Honours and promoted to air marshal on 1 July 1935. He attended the funeral of King George V in January 1936.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August, General Guglielmo Nasi led 35,000 Italian troops, {{the vast}} {{majority}} of them native fighters, across the border into British Somaliland. The invaders were organized into three columns: one on the left advancing north to the coast before swinging east to Berbera, one on the right making the opposite motion on the Burao road, and a main central column, led by Carlo de Simone, containing the bulk of his forces. The central column would force the British positions at Tug Argan and make straight for Berbera, effectively ending the campaign in one fell swoop. Nasi advanced quickly upon Hargeisa, forcing harrying British camel soldiers to withdraw by 5 August. After a few days of rest and <b>rearmament,</b> the march was resumed on 8 August. After two days of probing, de Simone reached the Tug Argan gap and prepared for the major assault, scheduled for 11 August. In the meantime, General A. R. Godwin-Austen arrived to take command of the enlarged British army.|$|E
5|$|Pattle worked {{toward this}} goal for some time until, in late 1935, by chance, {{he picked up a}} copy of the Johannesburg Star newspaper. The paper {{contained}} an advertisement by the Royal Air Force (RAF) which was offering five-year short service commissions for cadets throughout the British Empire. The RAF expansion schemes required a great influx of capable personnel into the organisation as <b>rearmament</b> and the need for fighting men heightened. Pattle decided that a career in the RAF offered better prospects than as an instructor in South Africa and applied. Early in 1936, he was invited to Britain as an applicant. He flew to London at his own expense to attend the selection processes and was offered a commission by the selection board. He immediately returned to South Africa to arrange his migration to Britain and left aboard SS Llandovery Castle on 30 April 1936.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Thorn of 1466 {{reduced the}} Teutonic Knights, but brought no lasting {{solution}} to the problem they presented for Poland and their state avoided paying the prescribed tribute. The chronically difficult relations had gotten worse after the 1511 election of Albrecht as Grand Master of the Order. Faced with Albrecht's <b>rearmament</b> and hostile alliances, Poland waged a war in 1519; the war ended in 1521, when mediation by Charles V resulted in a truce. As a compromise move Albrecht, persuaded by Martin Luther, initiated a process of secularization of the Order and the establishment of a lay duchy of Prussia, as Poland's dependency, ruled by Albrecht and afterwards by his descendants. The terms of the proposed pact immediately improved Poland's Baltic region situation, and at that time also appeared to protect the country's long-term interests. The treaty was concluded in 1525 in Kraków; the remaining state of the Teutonic Knights (East Prussia centered on Königsberg) was converted into the Protestant (Lutheran) Duchy of Prussia under the King of Poland and the homage act of the new Prussian duke in Kraków followed.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{had started}} an {{intensive}} <b>rearmament</b> near the Finnish border in 1938–1939. Finnish students and volunteers {{had spent the}} late summer 1939 improving the defensive structures across the Karelian Isthmus. On the Soviet side of the border, penal labour worked hard in order to add some density to sparse road and rail networks. In summer 1939 was an important phase of Soviet planning, told by Aleksandr Vasilevsky and Kirill Meretskov in their memoirs. The Supreme Council of War ordered the Commander of Leningrad Military District Merestkov to draft an invasion plan, instead of Chief of Staff Boris Shaposhnikov. The plan was adopted in July. Necessary assault troop deployments and commands were not initiated until October 1939, though operational plans made in September called for the invasion to start in November. Stalin however was certain that the Finns would change their opinion under Soviet pressure and cede the demanded territories.|$|E
5|$|The {{management}} of the construction was flawed from the start: the stem and sternposts, rudder frame, and propeller shaft brackets were not ordered in time, and the late discovery of this omission substantially delayed progress. Verkhovsky, having no time to place orders with reliable foreign suppliers, contracted the job to local plants already known for poor discipline and quality that were already loaded down with other Navy jobs. The industrial capacity of the Saint Petersburg area could not sustain even the modest rate of naval <b>rearmament</b> {{that the government was}} willing to finance. In April 1893 minor grievances evolved in a full-scale conflict between Verkhovsky and the board of the Alexandrovsky Steel Works, a ridiculous charge of 25 roubles nearly brought the work to a full stop. The savvy admiral always blamed the suppliers but did not even attempt to fix the disarray in his own office.|$|E
5|$|Manstein {{remained}} {{in the armed forces}} after the war ended. In 1918 he volunteered for a staff position with the Frontier Defence Force in Breslau (now Wroclaw) and served there until 1919. As part of Gruppenkommando II, he participated in the restructuring of the German Imperial Army of 500,000 men into the Reichswehr, the army of the Weimar Republic (restricted to 100,000 men by the Versailles Treaty). Recognised from an early age as a talented and intelligent commander, Manstein was chosen as one of only 4,000 officers permitted under the treaty. In 1921 he was appointed company commander of the sixth company of the 5th Prussian Infantry Regiment and next served as a staff officer for Wehrkreiskommando II and IV, teaching military history and tactics until 1927. That year he was promoted to major and served with the General Staff at the Reichswehr Ministry in Berlin, visiting other countries to learn about their military facilities and helping to draft mobilisation plans for the army. Promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was given command of the light infantry battalion of the 4th Infantry Regiment, serving with that unit until 1934. In 1933 the Nazi Party seized power in Germany, thus ending the Weimar period. In violation of the Versailles treaty, the Reichswehr had been secretly re-arming since the 1920s; the new government formally renounced the Treaty and proceeded with large scale <b>rearmament</b> and expansion of the military.|$|E
5|$|On 9 May 1936, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, {{proclaimed the}} colony of Africa Orientale Italiana (AOI, Italian East Africa), formed from Ethiopia (after the Italian {{victory in the}} Second Italo-Ethiopian War, fought 3 October 1935 – May 1936) and the {{existing}} Italian possessions of Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland. On 10 June 1940, Mussolini declared war on Britain and France, which made Italian military forces in Libya a threat to Egypt and those in Italian East Africa {{a danger to the}} British and French colonies in East Africa. Italian belligerence also closed the Mediterranean to Allied merchant ships and endangered British supply routes along the coast of East Africa, the Gulf of Aden, Red Sea and the Suez Canal. (The Kingdom of Egypt remained neutral during World War II but the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936 allowed the British to occupy Egypt and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan.) Egypt, the Suez Canal, French Somaliland and British Somaliland were also vulnerable to an attack from Italian East Africa but the <b>rearmament</b> plans of the Comando Supremo (Italian General Staff) were not due to mature until 1942; in 1940 the Italian armed forces were not ready for military operations against a comparable power.|$|E
