50|$|The {{monument}} {{was built}} on the former Möltenorter Schanze (Möltenort Fieldwork) in Heikendorf and dedicated on 8 June 1930. After suffering structural damage, it was rebuilt in 1938. It consists of a 15.3-metre-high pillar, at the top of which sits a 4.8-metre-high eagle (designed by Fritz Schmoll). Extensive rust penetration was discovered in the internal steel supporting structure of the eagle in 2000, rendering renovation work necessary. Since 12 July 2001, the original eagle with its galvanised, copper-coated iron skin {{has been replaced by a}} <b>recast</b> bronze <b>version</b> similar to it (designed by the firm Noack from Berlin). The eagle was removed again in March 2012 for necessary reinforcement work after the detection of signs of fatigue in the supporting structure. The planned date of its return - initially scheduled to be six weeks later - was subjected to repeated delays thereafter; eventually, on 25 April 2013, the eagle was able to reassume its position.|$|R
50|$|Gasser v MISAT (C-116/02) was a {{decision}} of the European Court of Justice regarding {{the interpretation of the}} Brussels convention of 1968 ruling that a court chosen in a choice of court agreement should stay its proceedings - as any other court chosen second within the Brussels regime - until the court first seized had declared it did not have jurisdiction. The court's decision was considered problematic as it favoured the uniformity of application of the Brussels regime jurisdictional rules temporarily over party autonomy. Due to similar provisions in the 2001 Brussels Regulation and Lugano Conventions, the interpretation also affects choice of court agreements under those later instruments. However, in the 2012 <b>Recast</b> <b>version</b> of the Brussels I Regulation chosen courts can take jurisdiction, even if a court not chosen has been addressed first.|$|E
50|$|The Brussels I Regulation {{contains}} a jurisdictional regime: the rules which courts of European Union Member States use {{to determine if}} they have jurisdiction in cases with links to more than one country in the European Union. The basic principle is that the court in the member state of the party that gets sued has jurisdiction, while other grounds exist, which are diverse in content and scope, and are often classified in descending order of exclusivity and specificity. The original Brussels regulation (44/2001) is with regard to jurisdiction rules very similar to the 2007 Lugano Convention (which applies when the dispute has links to more than one party the convention), containing the same provisions with the same numbering. Numbering -and certain substantial issues- will be different when a <b>recast</b> <b>version</b> of the Regulation applies from 1 January 2015 (1215/2012).|$|E
40|$|Technological {{progress}} {{can play}} a key role in raising standards of living while improving environmental quality. Well-designed environmental regulations encourage innovation, while poorly designed regulations can inhibit progress. The Porter hypothesis goes further to suggest that tougher environmental regulations could spur innovation, leading to increased productivity of market outputs. We apply frontier production analysis to measure various components of total factor productivity within a joint production model, which considers both market and environmental outputs. We test the causality between technological innovation and environmental regulation and find support for a <b>recast</b> <b>version</b> of the Porter hypothesis. ...|$|E

40|$|As {{practices}} change, so too {{must the}} language and concepts that define and describe them. That is the lesson {{to be drawn from}} the past few decades’ work on the commercial law of investment securities. Article 8 is the first article of the Uniform Commercial Code to reach a third generation. There is the original version, the 1978 version, and now the 1994 version. The original version was based on the traditional system in which buyers and sellers effected transfer of securities by physical delivery of certificates. The 1978 version added new provisions dealing with “uncertificated securities. ” Then the 1994 <b>version</b> <b>recast</b> the law to deal more adequately with the system of securities holding through intermediaries. In this essay, the author argues that as significant legal objects change, so too must the legal language affiliated with those objects. Just as a car is not really a horseless carriage, a securities position recorded electronically is not really an electronic certificate...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSimulation {{models for}} foam {{enhanced}} oil recovery are of two types: those that treat foam texture or bubble size explicitly (population-balance models) {{and those that}} treat the effects of foam texture implicitly through a gas mobility-reduction factor. The implicit-texture models all implicitly assume local equilibrium (LE) between the processes of foam creation and destruction. In published studies most population-balance models predict rapid attainment of local-equilibrium as well, and some have been <b>recast</b> in LE <b>versions.</b> In this paper we compare population-balance and implicit-texture (IT) models in two ways. First, we show the equivalence of the two approaches by deriving explicitly the foam texture and foam-coalescence-rate function implicit in the IT models, and then show its similarity to that in population-balance models. Second, we compare the models based {{on their ability to}} represent a set of N 2 and CO 2 steady-state foam experiments and discuss the corresponding parameters of the different methods. Each of the IT models examined was equivalent to the LE formulation of a population-balance model with a lamella-destruction function that increases abruptly {{in the vicinity of the}} limiting capillary pressure Pc*, as in current population-balance models. The relation between steady-state foam texture and water saturation or capillary pressure implicit in the IT models is essentially the same as that in the population-balance models. The IT and population-balance models match the experimental data presented equally well. The IT models examined allow for flexibility in making the abruptness of the coalescence rate near Pc* an adjustable parameter. Some allow for coarse foam to survive at high capillary pressure, and allow for a range of power-law non-Newtonian behavior in the low-quality regime. Thus the IT models that incorporate an abrupt change in foam properties near a given water saturation can be <b>recast</b> as LE <b>versions</b> of corresponding population-balance models with a lamella-destruction function similar to those in current PB models. The trends in dimensionless foam texture implicit in the IT models is similar to that in the PB models. In other words, both types of model, at least in the LE approximation, equally honor the physics of foam behavior in porous media...|$|R

40|$|The <b>recast</b> <b>version</b> of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2010 / 31 /EU) {{proposes a}} {{comparative}} methodology aimed at defining the energy performance of buildings “with {{a view to}} achieving cost-optimal levels”. Really, how can the cost-optimal technologies be detected? Moreover, how can the most proper packages of energy efficiency measures be chosen {{in order to obtain}} the cost-optimality? This paper would provide answers to these questions, by proposing a new methodology for the evaluation of the cost-optimality, by means of the multi-objective optimization of energy performance of buildings and indoor thermal comfort. The optimization procedure is developed by means of the coupling between MatLab and EnergyPlus, by implementing a genetic algorithm, and it allows the evaluation of profitable and feasible packages of energy efficiency measures applied to buildings. Then, following the adoption of these packages, the global cost over the lifecycle of the building is calculated, in order to identify the cost-optimal solution. After the presentation of the methodology, the developed method is proposed for the optimization of the energy retrofit of an existing building. Furthermore, the method can be applied also for new architectures, by considering reference buildings...|$|E
40|$|Technological {{change is}} central to {{maintaining}} standards of living in modern economies with finite resources and increasingly stringent environmental goals. Successful environmental policies can contribute to efficiency by encouraging, rather than inhibiting, technological innovation. However, little research to date {{has focused on the}} design and implementation of environmental regulations that encourage technological progress, or in insuring productivity improvements in the face of depletion of natural resources and increasing stringency of environmental regulations. ^ This study models and measures productivity change, with an application to offshore oil and gas production in the Gulf of Mexico using Data Envelopment Analysis. This is an important application because energy resources are central to sustaining our economy. The net effects of technological progress and depletion on productivity of offshore oil and gas production are measured using a unique field-level set of data of production from all wells in the Gulf of Mexico over the time period from 1946 – 1998. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that technological progress has mitigated depletion effects over the study period, but the pattern differs from the conventional wisdom for nonrenewable resource industries. ^ The Porter Hypothesis was recast, and revised version was tested. The Porter Hypothesis states that well designed environmental regulations can potentially contribute to productive efficiency in the long run by encouraging innovation. The Porter Hypothesis was recast to include market and nonmarket outputs. Our results support the <b>recast</b> <b>version</b> of Porter hypothesis, which examine productivity of joint production of market and environmental outputs. But we find no evidence for the standard formulation of the Porter hypothesis, that increased stringency of environmental regulation lead to increased productivity of market outputs and therefore increased industry profits. ^ The model is used to forecast market and environmental outputs under alternative policy scenarios. Reliable baseline forecast and response to different policy actions of production and pollution are critical to the formation of sound energy and environmental policy. Forecast of production and pollution until year 2050 are generated from the model. Detailed policy scenarios provide quantitative assessments of potential benefits that indicate the significance of potential benefits of technological change and well-designed environmental policy. ...|$|E
