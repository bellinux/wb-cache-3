The disaster started when [...] "Kopernik" [...] was instructed to climb to a higher flight level. When the necessary thrust was applied to all four engines, the low-pressure turbine of the number 2 engine disintegrated after 9 seconds. One piece of the turbine disc got ejected upwards, not causing any significant damage; the second piece shot into the engine number 1, damaging it seriously; finally, the third piece of the disc shot into the hull, severed the <b>rudder</b> and elevator <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> and destroyed the number 3 engine, causing loss of control over the plane; it also severed power cables for both the flight data recorder and the cockpit voice recorder. This caused the last moments of [...] "Kopernik" [...] not to be recorded.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this research, axially {{variable}} strength <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> (AVSCRs) {{are developed}} {{to solve the}} problems related to the axial power distribution of a reactor during power maneuvering of pressurized water reactors (PWRs). The <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are classified into two types: multipurpose <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> and regulating <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> Two multipurpose <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> banks (AVSCR 1, AVSCR 2) are newly developed; conventional axially uniform strength <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> are adopted as regulating <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> banks to minimize the design change. The newly developed AVSCRs are axially three-sectioned and their worth shapes are optimized to obtain appropriate moving characteristics related to the variation of the axial offset (AO) according to the motion of the AVSCRs. The operation strategy for the power maneuvering is developed in consideration of the moving characteristics of the AVSCRs. This strategy consists of simple logics, and no use of reactivity compen-sation by boron is considered. Finally, the AVSCRs are applied to the power maneuvering with a typical 100 - 50 - 100 %, 2 - 6 - 2 - 14 h pattern of daily load-follow for all burn-up state of the core. From the application results, it is shown that the use of AVSCRs makes it possible to regulate AO within the target band during the power maneuvering with only <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> Consequently, power maneuvering is accomplished without reactivity compensation by a change in boron concentration, and the AVSCRs can cover the entire burn-up states of the reactor core.

40|$|Several BWR {{utilities}} are adopting practices {{for determining the}} state of <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> based on the neutron sensitive LPRM and gamma sensitive TIP measurement systems of the nuclear reactor core. This method is in this study evaluated by quantitatively analyzing the detector sensitivity to several material and geometrical distortions in the detector vicinity, using the Los Alamos National Laboratory stochastic Monte Carlo code MCNP 5 and the Westinghouse 3 D core simulator POLCA 7. These results are used {{to determine whether or}} not there are potential pitfalls that need to be considered when applying the in-core detector based diagnostic methods to determine the state of <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> This study also addresses the utility concern about shutdown margin deterioration due to potential loss of neutron absorbing material from <b>control</b> <b>rods.</b> It is found that indication of potential <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> leakage by means of the LPRM and the gamma TIP probe detector systems is feasible, provided that both detector systems show similar deviations that correspond to the potential loss of neutron absorbing material from the <b>control</b> <b>rod.</b> Furthermore, it is possible to correlate the observed detector signaldeviation to the magnitude of the distortion. The study lays out criteria that need to befulfilled for indication of <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> leakage to be reasonable, but it is to be noted that nodefinitive stand is or can be taken regarding the state of individual <b>control</b> <b>rods</b> at anyutility. The shutdown margin is found not to be significantly deteriorated in any of the utility cases that are studied under an assumption of <b>control</b> <b>rod</b> loss of neutron absorbing material as apotential cause for anomalous detector readings.
