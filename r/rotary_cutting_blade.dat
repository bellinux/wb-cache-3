Phelps designed a gasoline powered mower in 1944. Later during the 1950s a generation of snow blowers were developed under the name of Snow Blow. Phelps held patents on over 20 innovations in the lawn industry including the first for a rotary mower grass catcher U.S. patent number 2,855,744 in 1960.|$|E
40|$|Free-form laser {{consolidation}} {{is a novel}} {{process that}} produces a functional part layer by layer directly from a CAD model. A laser beam is used to melt a controlled amount of injected powder on a base plate to deposit the first layer and on previous passes for the subsequent layers. As opposed to conventional machining processes, this computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) technology builds complete functional parts or features on an existing component by adding instead of removing material. In this paper, laser consolidation of CPM- 9 V tool steel will be described to produce <b>cutting</b> <b>blades</b> on low alloy steel base to manufacture <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> dies. The laser consolidated (LC) CPM- 9 V <b>cutting</b> <b>blades,</b> {{as well as the}} bond between the LC blades and the base, are metallurgically sound, free of cracks or porosity. Experimental results show that the LC CPM- 9 V has excellent mechanical properties. Its average tensile and yield strengths are about 1315 MPa and 821 MPa, respectively. Pin-on disk wear tests demonstrate that the wear loss of the LC CPM- 9 V material is only about 1 / 3 compared to that of the heat treated D 2 tool steel currently being used for making <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> dies. In production test, the LC CPM- 9 V die has successfully cut more than 180, 000 m of labels without the need of re-sharpening so far. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{influence}} of machining parameter in the driven <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> was examined by using finite element simulation. Three dimensional modeling of <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> of Inconel 718 was conducted and then cutting force, temperature distribution of chip and tool, chip thickness and its flow direction were analyzed. Then, {{the effect of the}} tool rotation speed was mainly focused on. When peripheral speed of the rotating tool increased, resultant cutting force decreased and the chip flow direction inclined to the tool rotating direction. Then high temperature region of chip became large. It was also shown that tool temperature on the driven <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> was lower than that of the conventional turning. FEM simulation results were compared with the experimental results. As a result, the resultant cutting force, chip flow direction and the tool temperature of the experimental results and the analysis results showed the same trend...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{standardized}} testing of dental <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instruments remains {{a problem because}} of the many significant parameters that require identi-fying and quantifying. In a previous study, hand-piece wear or degradation {{was identified as a}} potentially significant confounding variable leading to the suggestion that the use of industrial hand-pieces might be necessary. Therefore, the objective of this investigation was to measure and compare industrial and dental air rotor degradation during a simulated diamond <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instrument test. Two dental and two industrial products were tested in a random sequence using three replicate samples of each air rotor. The simulated test consisted of 10 diamond instruments each making 90 passes through a float glass substrate. The testing apparatus comprised a computer-interfaced device that controlled the contact force between the cutting diamond and the substrate. Air rotor performance was based on the time required to cut a standardized path through the substrate. The performance change that occurred from diamond instrument to instrument during the simulated test was attributed to air rotor degradation. Multiple regression analyses showed significant differences between replicate samples of the same type and between regression intercepts for different air rotor types. Surprisingly, four air rotors exhibited improving performance during the simulated test. Changing air rotor performance must be considered to achieve reliability for the testing of diamond <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> instruments.

40|$|The linear cutting system, {{developed}} by the U. S. Bureau of Mines, uses geometric principles {{developed by}} Cardan to produce a nearly constant cut depth. The new system has been extensively tested in a synthetic material under laboratory conditions to verify mechanical capability and to identify operational characteristics. Comparisons between 15 -rpm linear cutting and 50 -rpm <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> systems show significant improvement in respirable dust entrainment, product size distribution, and energy usage. Respirable dust is reduced {{by as much as}} 90 pct. Recovered product showed a 67 -pct reduction in - 0. 32 -cm (- 1 / 8 -in) material and a 200 -pct increase in + 5. 08 cm (+ 2 in) material. Average power was reduced by 66 pct for the linear cutting. Because the bit cutting paths differ between linear and <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting,</b> it was necessary to compare the two at the same cut depths and bit types. These comparisons show that low revolution per minute <b>rotary</b> <b>cutting</b> entrains about the same amount of respirable dust as the linear cutting system, but the average shaft torque may be 55 to 130 pct greater for the rotary system...|$|R

As cutting conditions, different coolant conditions, cutting speeds, circumferential velocity ratios, tool inclination angles, tool rotation directions and normal rake angles were tested.

It was {{also found that the}} circumferential velocity ratio, tool inclination angle, tool rotation direction and normal rake angle have optimal conditions that decrease wear.
