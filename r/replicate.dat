5|$|The {{life cycle}} of poxviruses is {{complicated}} by having multiple infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they <b>replicate</b> in the cytoplasm of the cell {{rather than in the}} nucleus. In order to <b>replicate,</b> poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses, the most important of which is a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} {{acts as a}} barrier that prevents both DNA and RNA viruses from entering the nucleus. Some viruses require access to proteins inside the nucleus in order to <b>replicate</b> and/or assemble. DNA viruses, such as herpesvirus <b>replicate</b> and assemble in the cell nucleus, and exit by budding through the inner nuclear membrane. This process is accompanied by disassembly of the lamina on the nuclear face of the inner membrane.|$|E
5|$|A {{pathogen}} is only {{successful in}} infecting an organism {{if it can}} get past its defenses. Pathogenic bacteria and protozoa have developed {{a variety of methods}} to resist attacks by phagocytes, and many actually survive and <b>replicate</b> within phagocytic cells.|$|E
40|$|An {{intention}} of MapReduce Sets for <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions analysis has to suggest criteria how <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions in <b>Replicated</b> Join {{data can be}} defined {{in a meaningful way}} and how they should be compared. Similitude based MapReduce Sets for <b>Replicated</b> Join Expression Analysis and MapReduce Sets for Assignment is expected to adhere to fundamental principles of the scientific <b>Replicated</b> Join process that are expressiveness of <b>Replicated</b> Join models and reproducibility of their <b>Replicated</b> Join inference. <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions are assumed to be elements of a <b>Replicated</b> Join expression space or Conjecture class and <b>Replicated</b> Join data provide “information ” which of these <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions should be used to interpret the <b>Replicated</b> Join data. An inference <b>Replicated</b> Join algorithm constructs the mapping between <b>Replicated</b> Join data and <b>Replicated</b> Join expressions, in particular by a <b>Replicated</b> Join cost minimization process. Fluctuations in the <b>Replicated</b> Join data often limit the <b>Replicated</b> Join precision, which we can achieve to uniquely identify a single <b>Replicated</b> Join expression as interpretation of the <b>Replicated</b> Join data. We advocate an information theoretic perspective on <b>Replicated</b> Join expression analysis to resolve this dilemma where the tradeoff between <b>Replicated</b> Join informativeness of statistical inference <b>Replicated</b> Join and their <b>Replicated</b> Join stability is mirrored in the information-theoretic <b>Replicated</b> Join optimum of high <b>Replicated</b> Join information rate and zero communication expression error. The inference <b>Replicated</b> Join algorithm is considered as an outlier object <b>Replicated</b> Join path, which naturally limits the resolution of the <b>Replicated</b> Join expression space given the uncertainty of the <b>Replicated</b> Join data...|$|R

40|$|The use of <b>replicates</b> is {{essential}} in logistic measurement error models with random, additive error, as it gives a consistent estimate of the variance of the measurement error. In this paper, we investigate two {{different aspects of the}} use of <b>replicates.</b> We look into the efficiency gain in using more than two <b>replicates</b> in situations where the <b>replicates</b> are correlated. We find that, unlike the situation with independent <b>replicates,</b> the efficiency gain is an almost linear function of the number of <b>replicates.</b> Further, we study the allocation of <b>replicates</b> among study subjects, and find that the optimal way of doing this is to allocate few <b>replicates</b> to as many subjects as possible, rather than allocating many <b>replicates</b> to fewer subjects.

5|$|At {{the ends}} of the linear {{chromosomes}} are specialized regions of DNA called telomeres. The main function of these regions is to allow the cell to <b>replicate</b> chromosome ends using the enzyme telomerase, as the enzymes that normally <b>replicate</b> DNA cannot copy the extreme 3′ ends of chromosomes. These specialized chromosome caps also help protect the DNA ends, and stop the DNA repair systems in the cell from treating them as damage to be corrected. In human cells, telomeres are usually lengths of single-stranded DNA containing several thousand repeats of a simple TTAGGG sequence.|$|E

40|$|To study {{chromatin}} structure at {{the sites}} of DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells, deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) sensitivity of newly <b>replicated</b> DNA in permeable mouse sarcoma cells was {{compared with that of}} newly <b>replicated</b> DNA in intact cells. About 35 % of the DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells was hypersensitive to DNase I, and the remaining DNA showed the same DNase I sensitivity as that of parental chromatin DNA. The sensitivity of DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells was higher than that of DNA newly <b>replicated</b> in intact cells, and was close to that of DNA <b>replicated</b> in the presence of cycloheximide. The sensitivity of DNA pulse-labeled with [3 H]deoxythymidine triphosphate by replication in permeable cells was reduced significantly by chasing with cold deoxythymidine triphosphate. The present results suggest that chromatin structure at {{the sites of}} DNA <b>replicated</b> in permeable cells is similar to that at the sites of DNA <b>replicated</b> in living cells in the absence of protein synthesis, and that some structural change (possibly toward the maturation) of newly <b>replicated</b> chromatin occurs after the DNA replication in permeable cells. </p...|$|R

40|$|Partially <b>replicated</b> T 4 DNA {{molecules}} (PRM) whose parental or progeny DNA {{was labeled}} with bromodeoxyuridine BUdR was analyzed by gradual shearing followed by CsCl banding of the sheared product.

40|$|The {{status of}} X-chromosome {{replication}} was studied in twenty-seven 69,XXY and nine 69,XXX human triploids {{in which the}} parental origin of the additional haploid set was known {{from the study of}} chromosome heteromorphisms.

Even when the market is arbitrage-free and a given contingent claim has a unique <b>replicating</b> portfolio, there may exist super <b>replicating</b> portfolios of lower cost. Bensaid et al. gave conditions under which the cost of the <b>replicating</b> portfolio does not exceed the cost of any super <b>replicating</b> portfolio.
