5|$|In the 1980s, Franklin {{participated in}} an {{organized}} campaign to win the right for conscientious objectors to redirect part of their income taxes from military uses to peaceful purposes. Her 1987 paper, written to support the campaign, argued that the well-recognized <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> military service on grounds of conscience should be extended to include the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> to pay taxes for war preparations. Franklin asserted that the freedom of conscience provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed this form of conscientious objection. Her paper was {{to be part of}} an appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada. The lower courts had convicted those withholding part of their taxes of violating the Income Tax Act. In 1990 however, the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal.|$|E

40|$|Hospital professionals' {{decisions}} to permit death are amalgams of medical, ethical, and legal judgments. Medical education and socialization {{and the business}} of health all focus on offering and providing treatment, not on facilitating death.

50|$|Susan Fraser, {{a lawyer}} in Canada who specializes in advocating for {{vulnerable}} people, argues that sanism is based on fear of the unknown, reinforced by stereotypes that dehumanize individuals. She argues that this causes the legal system to fail to properly defend patients' <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> potentially harmful medications; to investigate deaths in psychiatric hospitals and other institutions in an equal way to others; and to fail to properly listen to and respect the voices of mental health consumers and survivors.|$|R

50|$|Before this case, {{although}} attention {{had been}} focused on involuntary commitment standards, {{it was assumed that}} once the patient was hospitalized, hospitals could administer psychoactive medication without consulting either the patient or the family. This was the first case in which the focus shifted from standards of commitment to standards of treatment once hospitalized. This was {{the first of a series}} of cases that increasingly acknowledged patient <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> treatment and <b>right</b> <b>to</b> least restrictive treatment by way of a variety of First Amendment rights including freedom of religion and thought as well as the ultimate <b>right</b> <b>to</b> privacy, control over one's own body.|$|R

25|$|A {{panel of}} The Heart Rhythm Society, a {{specialist}} {{organization based in}} Washington, DC {{found that it was}} legal and ethical to honor requests by patients, or by those with legal authority to make decisions for patients, to deactivate implanted cardiac devices. Lawyers say that the legal situation is similar to removing a feeding tube, though there is currently no legal precedent involving pacemakers in the United States of America. A patient in the United States is thought to have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> or discontinue treatment, including a pacemaker that keeps him or her alive. Physicians have a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> to turn it off, but are advised by the HRS panel that they should refer the patient to a physician who will. Some patients believe that hopeless, debilitating conditions, like those brought on by severe strokes or late-stage dementia, can cause so much suffering that they would prefer not to prolong their lives with supportive measures, such as cardiac devices.|$|E

Such evidence-gathering is only done with the complete consent of the patient or the caregivers of the patient. Photographs of the injuries may be requested by staff. At this point in the treatment, if a victims' advocate had not been requested earlier, experienced social support staff are made available to the patient and family.|$|E

50|$|During his cases, Birnbaum {{sometimes}} {{disagreed with}} fellow advocates who were {{primarily concerned with}} civil liberties {{to the exclusion of}} welfare rights, such as lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union. The libertarians would emphasize a stricter due process on involuntary commitment and more <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>refuse</b> forced treatment, sometimes rejecting both entirely, though compromises were reached for joint legal actions. Birnbaum came to be horrified to see deinstitutionalization resulting in many mentally ill being in prison or on the streets rather than being properly helped. He felt that a clearer standard for a therapeutic quality of care was needed, whether in the community or hospital.|$|R
