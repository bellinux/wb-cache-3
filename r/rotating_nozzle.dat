40|$|A new {{turbocharger}} turbine {{concept that}} enhances exhaust energy recovery has been developed; {{it is known}} as the ‘rotating vane turbine’ (RVT). It aims to address the negative impact of the pulsating exhaust flow on the turbocharger turbine, so that the exhaust energy can be recovered more efficiently compared to the state of art turbocharging technologies. Different from traditional turbine configurations, in which the nozzle is stationary, the RVT incorporates a <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> ring at a relatively low speed. It thus minimises the deviation of the turbine incidence angle from the optimal design angle on average through a pulse cycle, it as such leads to an improvement of turbine performance. Two control methods are investigated for the rotating nozzle: a passive self-rotation and one that is controlled from the outside with the use of an external driving turbine. The geometry of the <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> ring is also optimized to reduce the incidence loss on the nozzle blade under unsteady flow. The new RVT is studied through numerical calculation in order to demonstrate that the <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> ring can adaptively change the flow angle at the turbine inlet through a pulse cycle. As a result, the turbine operating point is pushed to better performance region with higher turbine efficiency and lower pressure ratio, compared to a traditional stationary nozzle ring. The flow analysis shows that the turbine performance improvement is due to the reduction of the flow separation on the turbine blade under sub-optimal operating conditions. Detailed experimental testing is also carried out to further validate the new concept. Two rotating nozzles with different angles are tested under different flow frequencies, turbine speeds, turbine loads and mass flow rates. As comparisons, stationary vane turbine (SVT) and nozzleless turbine are also tested under the same operating conditions as for RVT. The testing results demonstrate that, the <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> ring can reduce the amplitude of the flow pulses, thereby reducing the unsteadiness level of the turbine operation. Similar to the simulation results, a significant increase in average turbine efficiency as well as a reduction of turbine pressure ratio are observed for RVT, compared to for SVT or nozzleless turbine. A preliminary study of 1 D engine simulation is also carried out to investigate the impact of the new RVT on the engine performance. The simulation results show that, the back pressure of the engine with RVT is reduced based on the same engine power output. This indicates the new RVT can effectively reduce the BSFC of an engine, compared to a traditional SVT. Open Acces...|$|E

Exposure to vibrations during cleaning declines when a straight spraying lance is used instead of a bowed spraying lance.

For farms with 300 sows and 2160 finishers annual costs for robot cleaning were ¿ 1170 higher than for manual cleaning.

Cleanability is affected by layout of the buildings and pens, food composition, feeding regime and material choice. Concrete floors and walls must be smooth.

In the centrifugal spinning process, a polymer solution has been pushed by the centrifugal force through small nozzle of a rapidly rotating cylindrical drum. Thereby thin fibers are formed and collected on a collector {{in the form of a}} web. Centrifuge spinning suffered from a strong air resistance which leads to a more deflected jet as well as its rapidly solvent evaporation resulting in thicker nanofibers. In this work, centrifuge spinning has been equipped by a rotating collector, whereas the fabrication process was skillfully sealed from ambient airflow. A comparison was drawn between the trajectory of Newtonian liquid jets fabricated by centrifuge spinning and air-sealed centrifuge spinning. The captured images of the liquid jet trajectory using a high speed camera showed that non-isolated liquid jets were more curved than isolated liquid jets due to air resistance. A pre-presented non-linear analysis of the Navier-Stokes equations was carried out and the numerical solutions were compared with the experiments. There was fairly good agreement between the isolated jet trajectory and the model-predicted one, but there were differences between the non-isolated jet trajectory and the simulation results.

Therefore, this work aimed at evaluation of different spraying techniques on the spray deposits and some parameters of soybean crop: grain size, weight of 1 000 seeds and the crop productivity.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the spatial droplet distribution around a rotary atomizer in an air cross flow. The droplet size, velocity, and spray distribution were measured using a phase Doppler particle analyzer system. The spray was photographed using a high-speed camera. The rotary atomizer was driven at speeds of 5000 rpm, 10, 000 rpm, and 15, 000 rpm. The fuel flow rate was held constant at 15 kg/h, and the air cross-flow velocities varied from 25 m/s to 150 m/s. The overall spray shape was observed to shrink toward the axis of rotation with increasing cross-flow speeds. High-speed visualization showed that the injected ligaments disintegrate into fairly large droplets and spread out in the radial direction at lower cross-flow velocities. At higher cross-flow speeds, the injected ligaments are abruptly deflected and broken up in the downstream direction close {{to the surface of the}} atomizer and are mixed with the cross-flow air stream immediately. The axial velocity profile indicates that a strong recirculation zone is formed just below the <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle.</b> A high tangential velocity is shown to exist close to the injection point. Further downstream, the radial velocity component is shown to be dominant, while the tangential velocity becomes weak. The axial velocities show similar trends for the same cross-flow velocities, as the droplets follow the dominant air stream formed by the cross flow regardless of rotational speed. Near the injection orifice, relatively larger droplets are concentrated in a narrow region close to the radius of the atomizer. As the liquid jet travels downstream, the droplets are dispersed by the cross flow and distributed over a wider area. The cross flow influences the Sauter mean diameter directly; however, the rotational speed of the nozzle only has a large effect on the spray at slower cross-flow conditions. This injector design is shown to have a circumferential uniformity of 14 3 ̆bcm, making it an acceptable choice for combustion applications. 9 2012 by Begell House, Inc.

Dried crusts were recovered and examined by Scanning Electron Microscopy. Skin-forming materials were classified into three types according to the mechanisms of skin formation. In the first type (typified by droplets of custard and starch) skin formed due to gelatinisation at high temperatures. Increasing the drying temperature resulted in increased crust resistance to mass transfer due to increased granule swelling and the crust resistance was completely transferred to a skin resistance at drying temperatures > 150 °C. In the second type e. g. gelatin droplets the skin formed immediately drying had taken place at any drying temperature. At drying temperature > 60 ° C a more resistant skin was formed. In the third type (typified by droplets of skim milk and fructose) the skin appeared on the droplet surface at a certain stage of the drying process under any drying conditions. As the drying temperature was increased the resistance of the skin to mass transfer increased. The drying rate history of any material depended upon the nature of the skin formed which, in turn, depended upon the drying conditions. A mathematical model was proposed for the drying of the first type of skin-forming material. This was based on the assumption that, once all the granules gelatinised at the gelatinisation temperature, a skin appeared instantaneously on the droplet surface. The experimentally-observed times at which the skin appeared on the droplets surfaces were in excellent agreement with those predicted from the model. The work should assist in understanding the fundamentals of paniculate drying processes, particularly when skin-formation occurs and may be a crucial factor in volatiles retention...|$|E
40|$|Tempress Small Mechanically-Assisted High-Pressure Waterjet Drilling Tool project {{centered}} {{on the development of}} a downhole intensifier (DHI) to boost the hydraulic pressure available from conventional coiled tubing to the level required for high-pressure jet erosion of rock. We reviewed two techniques for implementing this technology (1) pure high-pressure jet drilling and (2) mechanically-assisted jet drilling. Due to the difficulties associated with modifying a downhole motor for mechanically-assisted jet drilling, it was determined that the pure high-pressure jet drilling tool was the best candidate for development and commercialization. It was also determined that this tool needs to run on commingled nitrogen and water to provide adequate downhole differential pressure and to facilitate controlled pressure drilling and descaling applications in low pressure wells. The resulting Microhole jet drilling bottomhole assembly (BHA) drills a 3. 625 -inch diameter hole with 2 -inch coil tubing. The BHA consists of a self-rotating multi-nozzle drilling head, a high-pressure rotary seal/bearing section, an intensifier and a gas separator. Commingled nitrogen and water are separated into two streams in the gas separator. The water stream is pressurized to 3 times the inlet pressure by the downhole intensifier and discharged through nozzles in the drilling head. The energy in the gas-rich stream is used to power the intensifier. Gas-rich exhaust from the intensifier is conducted to the nozzle head where it is used to shroud the jets, increasing their effective range. The prototype BHA was tested at operational pressures and flows in a test chamber and on the end of conventional coiled tubing in a test well. During instrumented runs at downhole conditions, the BHA developed downhole differential pressures of 74 MPa (11, 000 psi, median) and 90 MPa (13, 000 psi, peaks). The median output differential pressure was nearly 3 times the input differential pressure available from the coiled tubing. In a chamber test, the BHA delivered up to 50 kW (67 hhp) hydraulic power. The tool drilled uncertified class-G cement samples cast into casing at a rate of 0. 04 to 0. 17 m/min (8 to 33 ft/hr), within the range projected for this tool but slower than a conventional PDM. While the tool met most of the performance goals, reliability requires further improvement. It will be difficult for this tool, as currently configured, to compete with conventional positive displacement downhole motors for most coil tubing drill applications. Mechanical cutters on the <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> head would improve cutting. This tool can be easily adapted for well descaling operations. A variant of the Microhole jet drilling gas separator was further developed for use with positive displacement downhole motors (PDM) operating on commingled nitrogen and water.

Four commercial units of that design are currently involved in a 10 -well field demonstration with Baker Oil Tools in Wyoming. Initial results indicate that the motor gas separators provide significant benefit...|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} is to adopt a fundamental approach towards the identification, measurement and modelling {{of the effect of}} pre- and post-processing upon shot-peening residual stresses. At present this is carried out in an ad hoc fashion with little understanding of the fundamental properties which are being affected by these treatments and of how these basic properties influence product performance and determine (the peening) process parameters. Indeed, current concern of reliability and efficiency of machinery alone justifies the widespread interest in the present investigation. The specific objectives arising from the above overall aim can be summarised as follows: (i) to identify, measure and model the effect of pre-processing upon the locked-in residual stress field and surface morphology of a prospective peening component, (ii) to identify, measure and synthesize the effect of shot-peening treatment upon the resulting stress field and surface profile of the treated component, (iii) to identify, measure and model the effect of post-processing upon the aforementioned parameters, and (iv) to examine the effect of residual stresses and incomplete-coverage upon ultimate product performance. Consideration of the surface profile will be accounted for in the analysis. The outcome of these investigations should provide the foundation necessary for process control and optimisation of working surfaces of components currently employed in aerospace, automotive and power generation industries. Accordingly a number of investigations will be carried out, in parallel, to highlight these effects. In view of the large number of variables involved in these processes, we focus our attention to the following: for pre-processing, controlled turning was selected and for post-processing, controlled grinding was selected. Residual stress measurements were performed by the centre hole air-abrasive off-centre <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> method, and whenever possible, the results were verified by other methods such as X-ray diffraction and etching. An experimental rig was designed, built and commissioned to allow for locating different sizes and shapes of cylindrical and flat components accurately near the 'drilling head'. The surface topography was measured, using a motorised stage and a profilometer of the stylus type. This arrangement enabled the three dimensional determination of treated surfaces. The materials investigated were typical of aircraft alloys: steel 817 M 40 and aluminium 7075, which were provided by a major landing-gear manufacturer (Dowty Rotol). In order to examine the effect of residual stresses and surface profile upon ultimate product performance, fatigue tests using electro-hydraulic servo-controlled test equipment were used to evaluate the effect of the treatment upon the fatigue life and relaxation of residual stresses. Both complete and incomplete coverage were considered in the analysis. The results of the work show that pre-processing can induce unfavourable tensile residual stresses, which are detrimental to the fatigue life of the component. They also show that peening residual stresses play an important role ~n negating these tensile residual stresses. Effects of surface profile due to the pre-treatment also indicated a major influence on the success of the treatment, and upon the selection of the appropriate peening parameters. As for post-processing, it was shown that the residual stresses varied linearily with depth removed and remained significant even after 50 percent of the arc height had been removed from the component...|$|E

40|$|The {{advantages}} of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for farmers {{in developing countries}} have been clear for many years. It cuts production costs by reducing reliance on expensive agrochemicals, reduces hazards to both humans and the environment and, at the same time, stabilizes yields by ensuring the survival of natural enemies of major pests. Yet its use is not understood. Why is this so? The idea of integrated pest management is not new. The original definition envisaged 'applied pest control which integrates biological and chemical control. Chemical control is used in a manner which is least disruptive to biological control'. Many scientists would now regard such a definition as too restrictive and would view chemical control {{as a last resort}} when other methods fail to keep a pest in check. More recently, the concept of IPM has been applied to the integrated control of different types of pests (for example, insects, diseases and weeds) in the same crop. Although originally distinct, the two terms integrated control and IPM are now used almost interchangeably to imply both concepts. The essential features of IPM are straightforward, although their application in specific cases requires considerable understanding of the biology of the pests involved and their natural enemies. They include three important principles. Firstly, wherever feasible, control should rely on natural enemies of pests; methods that seriously disrupt natural regulation of pest populations should never be used. Secondly, natural enemies should be enhanced, either directly or indirectly, and plant resistance used to reduce the necessity for expensive chemical control. The third principle is that chemical control should be selective and should only be used as and when pest populations increase to a level above which serious economic loss will result. The last of these principles needs further explanation. In most cases, pest populations will be low following planting but, in the absence of adequate natural controls, will increase rapidly as the crop develops. However, up until a certain level, there will be little or no damage of economic significance to the crop. The population level at which significant economic damage is observed is known as the economic threshold for a given pest and only above this threshold is chemical control employed. In this way, natural enemies are allowed to build up and expensive chemicals are not wasted. The economic threshold is obviously a moving target and differs between crops, pest species and, since it is dependent on the market value of a given crop, between seasons. Nevertheless, use of economic thresholds has proved its value in reducing crop production costs and is now very widely used in pest control schemes. The components of integrated pest control The weapons available to the farmer are of four types; biological control, cultural control, selective pesticide use and plant resistance. Biological control using natural enemies of pests can be achieved through introduction of predators, parasites or diseases. Introduction (in some cases re-introduction) of natural enemies is now a familiar concept. Although there have been some spectacular successes, for example the control of prickly pear by the moth Cactoblastis cactorium in Australia and of cottony cushion scale on citrus in California, it should be said that less than half of all attempts at biological control by introduction have been successful. While the reasons for this are complex, it does emphasize the importance of retaining existing control agents through the rational use of pesticides. This is particularly true in the tropics where many crops face dozens of different pest species. Although the effect of any one member of this pest complex may be relatively minor, in combination they can cause drastic losses. To introduce specific predators or parasites for each pest would be totally uneconomic, even if they could be found; enhancement of existing natural enemies, many of which feed non-selectively, is a more sensible alternative. Cultural control, which involves manipulation of the crop and its surrounding habitat aims to increase the chance of survival of natural enemies or reduce that of the pests. One obvious technique is to practice mixed cropping rather than monoculture. This can both reduce the size of pest populations by limiting the food resource available and provide alternative refuges for natural enemies. Intercropping has similar aims but on a finer scale. Other techniques include the provision of refuges (not necessarily a crop species) or food sources for natural enemies. In some situations, complete weeding of the crop may reduce yields since 'weeds' can provide both refuges and food sources for natural enemies. Destruction of crop residues by removal or burning can sometimes be successfully used to interrupt the development of pests that have a resting stage in such residues. Selective pesticide use is another possible approach. The most important facet of selective pesticide use is employing economic thresholds to limit the amount of chemicals applied. However, modern developments in both pesticides and their application can also reduce the need to spray the crop. Several insecticides now available have some degree of inherent selectivity. An example is Endosulfan (Thiodan), which is effective against a wide variety of crop pests but which, at recommended application rates, has little effect on the minute parasitic wasps that are important natural enemies of many pests. When used in ultra-low volume formulation for control of tsetse flies, this insecticide was found to have virtually no detectable effect on other insect populations. Insecticides that are based on hormonal growth regulators or on microbial agents also show some degree of selectivity in their action. Even more selectivity can be achieved by careful formulation and application of pesticides. Because systemic insecticides are taken up through the foliage or roots of the plant they are only available to the chewing or sucking insects that attack it. The same principle applies to insecticides that are encapsulated, wrapped in a coating of gelatine or similar inert substance. The tiny capsules adhere {{to the surface of the}} plant and the insecticide can only be taken up by biting insects that feed on the plant. This avoids risk to predators and parasites. New application techniques can reduce the amounts of pesticide required to achieve effective control. Ultra low-volume (ULV) spraying is now widely used, particularly for aerial application. A <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzle</b> breaks the spray up into a haze of minute droplets. The droplets are sufficiently small that they can pass directly into the insect's body through the spiracles, the pores through which insects, breathe, killing them more rapidly. In this way, the amounts of insecticide required for effective control can be drastically reduced, often by as much as one hundredfold. One disadvantage of ULV spraying is that the droplets are so small that they are blown away by even the lightest breeze, reducing effectiveness. An ingenious technique called electrostatic deposition avoids this problem by giving each droplet a minute positive electric charge. The surface of the plant has a small negative charge, attracting droplets to the plant cuticle, where they are deposited. The pesticide is effectively 'glued' to the plant by electric forces! A cheap, portable sprayer, using this principle has now been marketed and has proved extremely effective in the Third World, particularly for the control of cotton pests. Plant resistance is a further option in IPM. Plant breeding has played a crucial role in the prevention of crop losses due to diseases throughout the 20 th century, and disease-resistance is a major objective in the development of new crop varieties. The concept of breeding for insect pest resistance is a more recent one but has had considerable success and is being actively pursued, particularly for tropical crops. A good example is the range of rice varieties developed at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines. IRRI has bred varieties resistant to four of the major insect pests of rice which are now very widely grown in S. E. Asia. Several varieties are available which combine resistance to three of the four major pests. Insect resistant varieties of cowpea, an important tropical pulse, have been developed at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) in Nigeria using advanced biotechnologies. Successes in integrated control One of the earliest examples of successful IPM comes from the Canete Valley in Peru, where from the 1940 s, cotton was grown as a monocrop with extremely heavy use of insecticides. By 1955, yields plummeted following blanket application of organochlorine and organophosphorus insecticides which resulted in breakdown of natural biological control and the development of pest resistance. In 1956, the government introduced compulsory crop rotation and mixed cropping and enforced a return to older insecticides. One of these, lead arsenate, is a stomach poison which only kills insects that chew the plant and is ineffective against natural insect enemies. These measures were combined with regular inspection of the crop for pests so that insecticides were only used when pest populations exceeded the economic threshold. Cotton yields rapidly recovered to levels close to those before the crisis and the Canete Valley remains today, over 40 years later, a major cotton producing area of Peru. Integrated control of pests has not been widely used in Africa but there have been some successes. The common coffee mealybug was a major pest of coffee in Kenya where its populations had exploded due to resistance to persistent organochlorine insecticides and to loss of natural enemies. Restrictions on the use of these insecticides, combined with the introduction and dissemination of a minute parasitic wasp (Anagyrus sp.) brought the pest back under control. Similarly, in Tanzania a major pest of sugar cane, the sugar cane scale insect, has been successfully controlled by carefully timed insecticide application in conjunction with the release of a ladybird beetle which preys specifically on the pest. Cassava, an important staple crop for some 200 million people in Africa, is seriously threatened by the cassava mealybug, accidentally introduced from South America 20 years ago. In this case, classical biological control is proving highly successful. A parasite of the mealybug, itself from South America, is released from the air and has successfully controlled the bug over large areas of West and Central Africa. In Asia, Indonesia experienced a severe reduction in rice yields in recent years due to the ravages of the Brown Planthopper. This has resulted from excessive use of insecticides, to many of which the planthopper now shows resistance. By 1986, 100, 000 hectares of rice had been destroyed by this pest alone, despite 4 to 5 applications of insecticide in each growing season. In 1988, the Indonesian government took the decision to ban the use of 57 different types of insecticides and to reduce severely the use of the recommended Carbamate insecticides. This has allowed populations of natural enemies to recover and to provide adequate control of the planthopper. Between 1986 and 1988, average yields of rice in Indonesia increased from 6. 1 tonnes per hectare to 7. 4 tonnes per hectare, a gain of 21 % in two years. Considering this was achieved simply by reducing the amount of insecticide applied, and, thus, production costs, the {{advantages of}} rational insecticide use had been confirmed. As a result, FAO is now planning experimental programmes of integrated rice pest control in 6 other countries in the region. The problems IPM is not a panacea and, as with biological control, there have been failures as well as successes. Clearly, IPM requires that farmers have a better knowledge of both the pests and their natural enemies than is the case with simple chemical control. It is also difficult for farmers to 'do nothing' until the pest reaches an economic threshold, even though it is clearly present in the crop. This is particularly true if, previously, they have been advised to spray at the first signs of the presence of pests. Neither can IPM be used against all types of pests. It has proved impossible to devise schemes for highly migratory pests, such as locusts, and soil nests. such as termites. The future of integrated control IPM is used on only a very small proportion of the world's crops. Apart from the problems mentioned above, the rapid development of synthetic pyrethroid insecticides since the 1970 s has largely overcome the problems of pest resistance to earlier insecticides. Nevertheless, the need for more rational pest management will grow. The problem of pest resistance will not simply go away (some insects already show resistance to pyrethroids) and the cost of agrochemicals, which are largely oil-based, is likely to continue to rise sharply. Several of the components of IPM are now widely used in crop protection in the industrialized countries. Crop surveillance, combined with the use of an economic threshold for chemical control, is now widely used in such crops as cotton, alfalfa, tobacco and many fruit crops. And biological control has proved particularly successful for glasshouse crops, where chemical control poses particular problems and where there is good environmental control. What, then, is the likely future of IPM in the tropics ? The need for food security has lead to greater emphasis on sustainable agriculture, within which IPM can play a crucial role. It has proved most successful where farmers have sufficient resources and education to exploit the possibilities of longer term control strategies, but there are many developing countries, particularly in Africa, where this does not yet apply. In the medium term, it is likely that more rational use of insecticides, based on crop surveillance, is likely to increase, if only for economic reasons. Whether this will develop into fully integrated control in the longer term will probably depend more on economic and political factors than on purely technical considerations. Above all, successful introduction of IPM depends critically on reasonably stable and fair prices for agricultural produce, both staple foods for home consumption and cash crops for export. The advantages of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) for farmers in developing countries have been clear for many years. It cuts production costs by reducing reliance on expensive agrochemicals, reduces hazards to both humans and the environment and, [...] ...|$|E
50|$|The idea {{of using}} the same engine for {{vertical}} and horizontal flight by altering {{the path of the}} thrust led to the Bristol Siddeley Pegasus engine which used four <b>rotating</b> <b>nozzles</b> to direct thrust over a range of angles. This was developed side by side with an airframe, the Hawker P.1127, which became subsequently the Kestrel and then entered production as the Hawker Siddeley Harrier, though the supersonic Hawker Siddeley P.1154 was canceled in 1965. The French in competition with the P.1154 had developed a version of the Dassault Mirage III capable of attaining Mach 1. The Dassault Mirage IIIV achieved transition from vertical to horizontal flight in March 1966, reaching Mach 1.3 in level flight a short time later.|$|R

The tracker grid is moved to the position where the track-sensor variable has the desired value (generally a maximum or a minimum) and new interpolation coefficients are computed for information exchange across grid boundaries. Solutions are computed at the current location and time-step, and grid motion is brought into the solution via time metrics. The method is demonstrated by tracking a moving shock and vortices shed behind a circular cylinder.
