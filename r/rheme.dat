This is the culminating typology of the three, where the sign is understood as a structural element of inference.|$|E

Every sign is {{interpreted}} either as (<b>rheme)</b> term-like, standing for its object {{in respect of}} quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference.|$|E

25|$|However {{word order}} isn't {{a subject of}} {{intonation}} only. Different word orders often have different meanings in Lithuanian. There are also some strict rules and some tendencies in using different word placing. For example, a word that provides new information (<b>rheme,</b> or comment) has tendency to be postponed after other words, but not always {{to the end of}} the sentence. Adjectives precede nouns like they do in English, but order of adjectives in an adjective group is different from in English. If the main word order is followed, a temporal, locative or causal adjunct is put at the beginning of the sentence, while adjuncts of other types go directly before the verb and its objects (see the SVO rule above).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} intra-textual connections of written English discourse. For that purpose, five samples (10 paragraphs each) from a widely-used American nursing textbook were analysed for independent clauses. Then the semantic connections through cohesion among their Themes and <b>Rhemes</b> across clause boundaries were identified and the frequencies of the four types of connections (Theme/Theme, Rheme/Theme, Rheme/Rheme, Theme/Rheme) were counted. The results of the analysis revealed that the average number of independent clauses in a paragraph was 4. 54, that nominal Themes were more frequent than adverbial Themes, and that Rheme/Theme and Theme/Theme connections across independent clauses were more frequent than Rheme/Rheme and Theme/Rheme connections. It is expected that such textual knowledge should help EFL writers to write a coherent text for a practical purpose similar to that of the material used in this study...|$|R
50|$|A <b>rheme</b> (also called sumisign and seme*) is a {{sign that}} {{represents}} its object in respect of quality and so, in its signified interpretant, is represented as a character or mark, though it actually may be icon, index, or symbol. The rheme* (seme) stands as its object for some purpose. A proposition with the subject places left blank is a rheme; but subject terms by themselves are also rhemes. A proposition, said Peirce, can be considered a zero-place <b>rheme,</b> a zero-place predicate.|$|E
50|$|Here, the theme—the {{grammatical}} {{point of}} departure—is in bold text; it announces {{at the start}} to the listener or reader what the message will be about—the writer's or speaker's angle ("I'm {{going to tell you}} what they need for breakfast"). The <b>rheme</b> (the rest of the clause) is in regular text. This type of clause sets up the theme-plus-rheme structure in the form of an equation, where theme = <b>rheme.</b> The equation is always expressed by some form of the verb be.|$|E

Fifteen nests were found, 10 in Valsavarenche and 5 in Val di <b>Rhêmes,</b> from 1600 m up to the upper tree line at 2032 m, which represents the current altitudinal record for the species. All the nests were composed by layers of different plant matter. This structure may promote insulation and protection from wind and low temperatures, and is typical of reproductive females. Nests were also found in sites surrounded by few woody species, which hardly cover the food requirements of the dormice throughout their season of activity, suggesting the use of alternative resources such as insects or other invertebrates. The presence of hazel dormice at these altitudes indicates that this species can adapt to less diverse habitats and extreme climatic conditions...|$|R
50|$|Because {{of those}} classificatory interdependences, the three trichotomies {{intersect}} to form ten (rather than 27) classes of signs. There are also {{various kinds of}} meaningful combination. Signs can be attached to one another. A photograph is an index with a meaningfully attached icon. Arguments are composed of dicisigns, and dicisigns are composed of <b>rhemes.</b> In order to be embodied, legisigns (types) need sinsigns (tokens) as their individual replicas or instances. A symbol depends as a sign on {{how it will be}} interpreted, regardless of resemblance or factual connection to its object; but the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of the object. A symbol is instanced by a specialized indexical sinsign. A symbol such as a sentence in a language prescribes qualities of appearance for its instances, and is itself a replica of a symbol such as a proposition apart from expression in a particular language. Peirce covered both semantic and syntactical issues in his theoretical grammar, as he sometimes called it. He regarded formal semiotic, as logic, as furthermore encompassing study of arguments (hypothetical, deductive, and inductive) and inquiry's methods including pragmatism; and as allied to but distinct from logic's pure mathematics.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis article {{outlines}} {{advances in}} thematic progression {{theory in the}} hope they {{may be useful to}} teachers of writing, especially with non-native and non-European students. Thematic progression denotes the strategies available to writers for linking the themes and <b>rhemes</b> in a clause to those of surrounding clauses. It is a key factor in the structuring of information because it acts as a bridge between sentence level and discourse level, coordinating cohesion and coherence. This paper compares the use of thematic progression in essays by students on a course leading to MA studies in journalism, media and communications with that in two leading British newspapers. It considers how assignment writing could be improved generally by teaching the rudiments of progression theory. If students' assignments are to be clear in their development but also varied and interesting for the reader, additional progression skills are required. In particular, this paper recommends certain variations on Daneš' progression types, as well as the use of more breaks (non-participant themes) to mark rhetorical transitions in the text. Familiarisation with the thematic progression in tabloids and broadsheets, respectively, should provide an overview of a range of progression from formal to outspoken, which would raise awareness of what is available, even if not all elements are appropriate for all types of academic writing...|$|R

5000|$|Fearing that Lermontov's {{father would}} {{eventually}} claim {{his right to}} bring up his son, Arsenyeva strictly limited contact between the two, causing young Lermontov much pain and remorse. Despite all the pampering lavished upon him, and torn by the family feud, he grew up lonely and withdrawn. In another early autobiographical piece, [...] "Povest" [...] (The Tale), Lermontov described himself (under the guise of Sasha Arbenin) as an impressionable boy, passionately in love with all things heroic, but otherwise emotionally cold and occasionally [...] Having developed a fearful and arrogant temper, he took it out on his grandmother's garden {{as well as on}} insects and small animals ("with great delight he would squash a hapless fly and bristled with joy when a stone he'd thrown would kick a chicken off its feet"). Positive influence came from Lermontov's German governess Christina <b>Rhemer,</b> a religious woman who introduced the boy to the idea of every man, even if that man was a serf, deserving respect. In fact, Lermontov's poor health served in a way as a saving grace, Skabichevsky argued, for it prevented the boy from further exploring the darker sides of his character and, more importantly, [...] "taught him to think of things... seek pleasures that he couldn't find in the outer world, deep inside himself." ...|$|R
40|$|Many English {{teachers}} {{posed the}} problem that their Arab {{students were able to}} construct grammatically correct sentences, but were frequently unable to form them into paragraphs or cohesive texts. In my attest to investigate this problem, I started from the assumption that differing patterns of cohesion in English and Arabic probably account for many difficulties Arab students have in writing English. Sane attempts to look at this, based on a contrastive approach, have already been carried out. For my part, I felt the time had came to look at the systems of Arabic in their own terms, which has not yet been done. For this I followed two avenues of study: Functional Sentence Perspective as developed in the Prague School and Halliday and Hasan's work on textual cohesion. For my purpose I selected four lengthy Arabic texts belonging to different text-types which I first analysed from the Functional Sentence Perspective point of view. For this, I followed Dane's (1974) study of thematic progressions, in order to find out what theme-rheme patterns the different Arabic text-types use. In the next step, I investigated the cohesive ties used in written Arabic Halliday and Hasan's model of textual cohesion (1976). I also compared my texts in order to discover if there is a difference in textual cohesion between text-types in Arabic. My analysis of textual cohesion and text development suggests that: 1. Arabic descriptive texts tend to reiterate the same there in successive sentences. 2. Arabic instructive texts favour the use of the linear thematization of <b>rhemes.</b> 3. Arabic makes inter-clausal relationships explicit. 4. Repetition and parallelism are favoured cohesive devices in all text-types. The thesis consists of an introduction followed by a chapter reviewing various approaches to discourse analysis, a chapter on the text-typological approach which has governed my selection of texts; followed by an account of my methodological approach and my analysis...|$|R
40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} {{aspects of the}} discourse structure of English and Arabic in general and political editorial argumentative texts in particular. Three major notions are examined and compared: subordination and coordination, thematic structure, and grounding (foreground and background). Arabic nominal and verbal sentences and clauses are also examined and compared. In this study, the data, which represent twenty four newspaper editorials taken from two English and Arabic newspapers (twelve editorials from each language), are qualitatively and quantitatively analysed. At the syntactic level, the analysis shows that English editorials use relatively simple and short sentence structures. Arabic editorials, by contrast, employ complex structures. Subordinate clauses are less common in English than in Arabic. Arabic uses coordinate clauses more than English does. The analysis also shows that Arabic editorials use more nominal sentences (SVO sentences) than verbal ones (VSO sentences). These two sentence types also differ in their employment of adjunct and disjunct clauses and phrases. At the thematic level, Arabic displays more complex thematic structures than English. The analysis also shows that there are specific markers in the Arabic data which signal rhematic elements. At the grounding level, {{it is found that}} clauses and phrases which meet the grounding expectation (that main clauses are foregrounded and subordinate clauses/phrases are backgrounded) are more frequent in English than in Arabic. It is also found that clauses and phrases which do not fulfill the grounding expectation are more frequent in English editorials than their Arabic counterparts. Another major difference between the two languages at this level is that most frequent clauses and phrases which do not meet the grounding expectation are final <b>rhemes.</b> In some cases, however, these clauses and phrases occur initially as themes, particularly in Arabic.
