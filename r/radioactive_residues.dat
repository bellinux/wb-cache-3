Radioactively-labelled phosphine is a useful and sensitive tool to study residues of phosphine in grains and their fractions. This research will assist industry to improve phosphine fumigation practice. Five representative grains (wheat, barley, oats, canola and lupins) were fumigated with 32 P labelled phosphine at 700 ppm and 25 ± 2 °C for two weeks exposure. Two types of residues were formed in grains from phosphine fumigation – phosphine residue and phosphine converted non-volatile residues.

Radiation imagery shows that more than 80 % of 32 P residues were located or distributed in the embryo, testa, pericarp and husk of wheat, barley, canola, lupins and oats.

Fish were exposed to [14 C] radiolabelled NPEOs, averaging either 3 ethoxy units (NP 3 avEO) or 7 ethoxy units (NP 7 avEO), over a 4 -day period in a flow-through aquarium. A method was developed to extract <b>radioactive</b> <b>residues</b> from soft tissues and analyse their composition by normal phase radio-HPLC and GC-MS. <b>Radioactive</b> <b>residues</b> were detected in all soft tissues of the roach dosed with either of the test mixtures, but the concentration of NPEO residues in each tissue were highest in fish exposed to the NP 3 avEO compared with the NP 7 avEO test mixture.

Apple ACC synthase was purified with an immunoaffinity gel, and its active site was probed with NaB 3 H 4 or Ado[14 C]Met.

Peptide sequencing of both 3 H- and 14 C-labeled peptides revealed a common dodecapeptide of Ser-Leu-Ser-Xaa-Asp-Leu-Gly-Leu-Pro-Gly-Phe-Arg, where Xaa was the modified, <b>radioactive</b> <b>residue</b> in each case. Acid hydrolysis of the 3 H-labeled enzyme released radioactive N-pyridoxyllysine, indicating that the active-site peptide contained lysine at position 4. Mass spectrometry of the 14 C-labeled peptide indicated a protonated molecular ion at m/z 1390. 6, from which the mass of Xaa was calculated to be 229, a number that {{is equivalent to the}} mass of a lysine residue alkylated by the 2 -aminobutyrate portion of AdoMet, as we previously proposed.

40|$|<b>Radioactive</b> <b>residues,</b> {{in order}} to be {{classified}} as Low-Level Waste (LLW), need to fulfil certain conditions; the limitation of the maximum activity from long-lived radionuclides is one of these requirements. In order to verify compliance to this limitation, the abundance of these radionuclides in the residue must be determined. However, performing this determination through radiometric methods constitutes a laborious task. In this work, 129 I concentrations, 239 + 240 Pu activities, and 240 Pu/ 239 Pu ratios are determined in low-level <b>radioactive</b> <b>residues,</b> including resins and dry sludge, from nuclear power plants in Spain. The use of Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) enables high sensitivities to be achieved, and hence these magnitudes can be re determined with good precision. Results present a high dispersion between the 129 I and 239 + 240 Pu activities found in various aliquots of the same sample, which suggests the existence of a mixture of resins with a variety of histories in the same container. As a conclusion, it is shown that activities and isotopic ratios can provide information on the processes that occur in power plants throughout the history of the residues. Furthermore, wipes from the monitoring of surface contamination of the José Cabrera decommissioning process have been analyzed for 129 I determination. The wide range of measured activities indicates an effective dispersal of 129 I throughout the various locations within a nuclear power plant. Not only could these measurements be employed in the contamination monitoring of the decommissioning process, but also in the modelling of the presence of other iodine isotopes.
