Fish is a favored food among the otters, {{but they also}} consume various {{amphibians}} (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well.|$|E

5|$|When {{published}} in bound volumes, {{the legislative history}} documents are placed in separate volumes {{apart from the rest}} of the materials published by U.S.C.C.A.N. Prior to the 99th Congress, the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. contained only a House or Senate report. Since the 99th Congress (1985–87), the legislative history materials in U.S.C.C.A.N. have included the House or Senate report, the committee report, and any presidential signing statements. U.S.C.C.A.N. is considered a more <b>readily</b> <b>accessible</b> source for some of these materials, like committee reports, than the originals. As a result, it is recommended by the Bluebook as a citation source in addition to the original document.|$|E

Nevertheless, such knowledge has remained mostly qualitative. In this contribution, I show how information extracted from a network representation {{can be used in a}} quantitative way, to improve the score of a classification task. As a test bed, I consider a dataset corresponding to patients suffering from prostate cancer, and the task of successfully prognosing their survival. When information from a complex network representation is added on top of a simple classification model, the error is reduced from 27. 9 % to 23. 8 %. This confirms that network theory can be used to synthesize information that may not <b>readily</b> be <b>accessible</b> by standard data mining algorithms...|$|R
