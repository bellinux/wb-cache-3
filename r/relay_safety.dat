A variety of laboratories {{provide opportunities for}} students to actively and experientially engage in scientific inquiry and agricultural applications. In the course of skill development, evidence has suggested students will be more safety conscious if teachers also follow proper safety practices, demonstrate accurate safety knowledge, provide a safe laboratory environment, convey a positive safety attitude, and <b>relay</b> <b>safety</b> expectations to students (Harper, 1984).

40|$|Every {{industrial}} production, particularly chemical processing, demands {{special attention}} in conducting the technological process {{with regard to}} the security requirements. For this reason, production processes should be continuously monitored by means of control and alarm safety instrumented systems. In the production of nitric acid at Petrokemija d. d., the original alarm safety system was designed as a combination of an electrical <b>relay</b> <b>safety</b> system and transistorized alarm module system. In order to increase safety requirements and modernize the technological process of nitric acid production, revamping and upgrading of the existing alarm safety system was initiated with a new microprocessor system. The newly derived alarm safety system, Simatic PCS 7, links the function of "classically" distributed control (DCS) and logical systems in a common hardware and software platform with integrated engineering tools and operator interface to meet the minimum safety standards with safety integrity level 2 (SIL 2) up to level 3 (SIL 3), according to IEC 61508 and IEC 61511. This professional paper demonstrates the methodology of upgrading the logic of the alarm safety system in the production of nitric acid {{in the form of a}} logical diagram, which was the basis for a further step in its design and construction. Based on the mentioned logical diagram and defined security requirements, the project was implemented in three phases: analysis and testing, installation of the safety equipment and system, and commissioning. Developed also was a verification system of all safety conditions, which could be applied to other facilities for production of nitric acid. With the revamped and upgraded interlock alarm safety system, a new and improved safety boundary in the production of nitric acid was set, which created the foundation for further improvement of the production process in terms of improved analysis...|$|E

40|$|International audience—Road safety can be {{improved}} a lot {{with the help of}} Cooperative Collision Warning System, in which vehicles cooperate with each other for <b>relaying</b> <b>safety</b> messages to avoid accidents.

We aim to minimize the total transmission energy and reduce the transmission interference for delivering emergency safety messages to endangered vehicles while guaranteeing timeliness of safety messages and transmission reliability of inter-vehicle communications. The emergency safety message dissemination problem is formulated as a spanning tree optimization problem with both hop-count constraint and reliability-height constraint.

This connection is used to check and monitor the position of actuators, which are activated or shut down via the safety contacts.

In all installations, there is a filterlock (consisting of a filter assembly and a vacuum or electric solenoid operated shut-off valve) located at the input to the converter. In European converters, {{there is also a}} solenoid in the converter to shut off the idle circuit. These valves are usually both connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. Where solenoids are fitted to the outputs of fuel tanks, these are also connected to the output of the tachometric relay or oil pressure switch. In installations with multiple tanks, a switch or changeover relay may be fitted to allow the driver to select which tank to use fuel from. On bi-fuel, the switch used to change between fuels is used to turn off the tachometric relay.|$|R

50|$|The {{cause of}} the failure was the setting of a {{protective}} relay {{on one of the}} transmission lines from the Sir Adam Beck Hydroelectric Power Station No. 2 in Queenston, Ontario, near Niagara Falls. The <b>safety</b> <b>relay</b> was set to trip if other protective equipment deeper within the Ontario Hydro system failed to operate properly.On a particularly cold November evening, power demands for heating, lighting, and cooking were pushing the electrical system to near its peak capacity. Transmission lines heading into Southern Ontario were heavily loaded. The system operators were not aware of a potential ambiguity between the extremely heavy power flows into Ontario and the setting upon which the relay was properly designed to operate. As a result of this ambiguity, at 5:16 p.m. Eastern Time, a small variation of power originating from the Robert Moses generating plant in Lewiston, New York caused the relay to trip, disabling a main power line heading into Southern Ontario. Instantly, the power that was flowing on the tripped line transferred to the other lines, causing them to become overloaded. Their own protective relays, which are also designed to protect the line from overload, tripped, isolating Beck Station from all of Southern Ontario.|$|R
40|$|Forklift related {{accidents}} {{contribute a}} significant proportion of workplace fatalities all over the world.   No more severe is this problem than in the USA, the location where the majority of forklifts are manufactured.   “OHSA estimates forklifts cause about 85 fatal accidents per year, 34, 000 accidents result in serious injury and 61, 800 are classified as non-serious”. (Hall, 1996) Furthermore forklift accidents occur indiscriminately across all industry sectors, however a significant fatality ‘blackspot’ exists for plant and machine operators within the Manufacturing industry (NOHSC, 1998).    A high density of pedestrian workers exists within this environment, which in addition to vehicle roll-overs comprise the main accident mechanisms.   Conditions like narrowed aisleways and carrying loads were found to increase the likelihood of such accidents nearly two fold. (Collins et al (a), 1999) Certain risk factors were found to be inherent, due to the design and functional requirements of the forklift.   The narrow track coupled to a variable centre of gravity makes stability a primary concern whilst operating.   Cornering and the responsive steering characteristics of forklifts are two unbridled determinants of the vehicle’s stability.   Toyota was found to be the only forklift manufacturer {{to address the issue of}} forklift stability, and does so with the advent of SAS technology introduced on their new 7 Series forklift. (Thomas, 1999) Stability becomes even more of an issue when handling loads, especially when adjusting the mast whilst the forks are elevated.   Both Toyota and Komatsu forklifts now have an automatic mast-levelling feature, which is an initial step towards reducing the impact of this hazard (Robertson, 1999).    Further development of this feature is required so that the effects of steering actions, uneven terrain and positioning the load is represented therefore making this an even more desirable feature. Whilst the challenge of maintaining stability for forklifts is renowned, a great concern exists due to the absence of an effective means to warn or restrict operators from handling unsafe loads or performing unsafe actions.   Adaptation of attitude indicators as used in aviation to inform pilots of the aircraft’s dynamics, may be an example of a more effective means of <b>relaying</b> stability <b>safety</b> information rather than a basic load chart (Allstar Networks, 2000).   This could be the first stage of technological advancement, which prevents actions from occurring that may contravene the vehicle’s safety dynamics.
