40|$|The design {{theory and}} method of <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> for double-helix screw of {{progressing}} cavity pump are presented. Through analyzing {{the shape and}} characteristic parameters of double-helix screw, the helicoids equation and axial curve equation of double-helix screw were established. According to the relative position relations between <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> and double-helix screw in the machining process, the geometric mapping relationship of screw coordinate system and <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> coordinate system was established by using the coordinate transformation theory. Based on noninstantaneous envelope method and the meshing conditions between <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> and double-helix screw, the contact line equations were established by minimum value method. By analyzing the machining errors caused by resharpening the <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter,</b> the tooth back curve equation was established based on spiral of Archimedes, and the profile equation of <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> with constant back angle was got. On this basis, the <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> of processing double-helix screw was designed, and the cutter head and tool post were manufactured, respectively. The measuring results have shown that this method can satisfy the requirements of machining accuracy for double-helix screw. So this is an effective method to get <b>formed</b> milling <b>cutter</b> profile for double-helix screw...|$|R

In profile {{envelope}} {{process of}} <b>form</b> <b>cutter</b> for involute gear, the grinding depth is variable which causes grinding force to change {{on a large}} scale and the profile error of envelope to increase. To improve <b>form</b> <b>cutter</b> accuracy, a closed-loop control system was designed to accomplish control of envelope process. For complicated dynamic process, fuzzy controller is used to adjust parameters online. By measuring grinding force, characteristic information of grinding process is acquired. Regulation factor of feed rate is determined by grinding force ratio, force deviation and its change rate used as evaluation indexes. Thus, fuzzy control of constant force grinding process is accomplished. Simulation and cutter grinding test indicates that the system has high precision and stability, and reduces cutter error effectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{design of}} cutters is an {{important}} consideration for the manufacture of helicoidal surfaces such as extruder screw surfaces. These surfaces are produced mostly by milling processes using <b>form</b> <b>cutters</b> of end mill type, side mill type or disc type, such as side-and-face mill or grinding wheel. The methodology proposed in the paper addresses {{the problem of the}} design of cutters for the machining of helicoidal surfaces.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve <b>form</b> <b>cutter</b> {{accuracy}} in grinding process, a closed-loop control system was designed to accomplish adaptive control of constant force in grinding process.

Regulation factor of feed rate is determined by grinding force ratio, and force deviation and its change rate are used as evaluation indexes. Thus, adaptive control of constant force in grinding process is accomplished.
