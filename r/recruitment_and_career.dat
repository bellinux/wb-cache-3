The authoress identified a partial reproduction of the political elite which may be defined as reproduction circulation. The first form is structural reproduction that is evident in continuities of the socio-demographic profile of political elites. The second-strongest form of path dependency is functional reproduction that was found in career paths of political elites. Finally, individual reproduction was prominent. This reproduction should decrease over time, while functional and structural reproduction are likely to remain. " (author's abstract...|$|R

40|$|Background: The Allied Health Professions Support and Development Scheme was a {{pilot project}} {{administered}} by NHS Education for Scotland (NES) and the Scottish Government. The scheme {{was put in place}} to aid in the <b>recruitment,</b> retention <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development of newly qualified practitioners (NQPs) in NHSScotland.

40|$|In Europe, {{academic}} mobility {{has a long}} tradition which began with the birth of the European universities in the middle ages. Recently, European policies were strongly oriented towards the promotion of student and {{academic mobility}} and the creation of research networks and projects within Europe. Nevertheless, academic labour markets in Europe remain highly national and many obstacles hinder the development of European <b>careers</b> <b>and</b> the europeanisation/internationalisation of academic recruitments. Two different perspectives will be developed in this paper. First we will document the strong divergences among the national <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>careers</b> processes within Europe and the problems raised by this situation. Second, we will draw on two empirical studies we conducted on academic mobility, the first one, led in 1995 in France, Germany and the UK and the second this year in France. Both studies show that most post-does conceived their foreign experience as a personal strategy and aimed at improving their chances for recruitment in their own country. Within Europe, foreign country careers still are an exception due to "accidental" opportunities...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} {{shifts in the}} social make-up of the Bavarian officer corps during the German confederation {{and the development of}} the role the officers played in Bavarian society. The study explores social patterns of <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>careers</b> as well as the military conditioning of the officers as it related to their social status. It analyses the social prestige, the inner coherence and the social self-concept of the Bavarian officer corps and detects continuities and changes in these sectors as well as their reciprocal relations over the period of examination of five decades. The analysis clearly shows that the development of the Bavarian officer corps had different characteristics than that of the Prussian. The Bavarian officer corps emerges as a socially inhomogeneous military elite lacking the Prussian social exclusiveness. The officers stayed in constant touch with the milieu of their family background. Only the military reform beginning in 1868 based on the Prussian model created an unprecedented level of education and assimilation of the officers and led to an increasing convergence to the situation of the Prussian officer corps.

50|$|On October 25, 2007, {{an attempt}} by the student union at the University of Victoria to ban Canadian Forces from {{participating}} in career fairs on campus failed when the student body voted overwhelmingly in favour of allowing the Canadian military to participate in <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development activities available to students. Approximately 500 students, five times the usual attendance, appeared at the Annual General Meeting of the University of Victoria Students' Society (UVSS), and voted to defeat the motion proposed to stop the Canadian Forces from appearing on campus at career development events, with an estimated 25 votes in favour of the ban. Those voting against the ban argued that the ban was a restriction on freedom of choice and an infringement of students' free speech, that it went beyond the mandate of student government, and that student union executives should not be advocating policy that does not reflect the views of the fee-paying student body.|$|E

40|$|This article {{sets the}} {{framework}} for the subsequent special issue on political <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development of local councillors in a comparative perspective. After conceiving <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development as a funnel-like process filtering out the few from the few and leading to patterns of interpositional mobility in the political realm, the article proceeds by proposing the ideal-types of layman and professional to characterize the poles of the continuum upon which current trends in <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> may be situated. Overall, these trends seem to point at a shifting structure of opportunities with predominant professionalization and partial socio-demographic democratization. Still, from a comparative perspective the extent to and the pace by which these general trends emerge {{are likely to be}} contingent upon the country, the municipality and the individual councillors studied. The comparative dataset on which the issue draws offers a unique opportunity to discern empirical patterns in the factors discussed above. The article concludes by outlining the issue and summarizing its main findings revealing a complex reality in the different phases of <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development of the contemporary councillor in Europe...|$|E
40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} matter in discussing the effect of <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development on the importance councillors attach to various tasks associated with their office. It starts from the assumption that professionalization would lead to giving inward-looking tasks more importance {{to the detriment of}} their outward counterparts. The analysis shows the question of matter is much more complex in reality in terms of co-variation and causation and is contingent upon (supra-) local structures of opportunities. Overall, (existing) explanations are rather weak. Early stages in the recruitment process seem to matter most and {{have a negative effect on}} outward-looking tasks. Whereas specific patterns of path dependency in terms of <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> <b>career</b> development thus do appear, the road taken in public office is long and winding and does not always straightforwardly reflect the common legacy of shared past experiences in the way towards it...|$|E

40|$|Untested {{changes in}} nursing {{education}} in Australia, {{such as the}} introduction of double degrees in nursing, necessitate a new research approach to study nursing career pathways. A {{review of the literature}} on past <b>and</b> present <b>career</b> choice theories demonstrates these are inadequate to gain an understanding of contemporary nursing students’ career choices. With the present worldwide shortage of nurses, an understanding of career choice becomes a critical component of <b>recruitment</b> <b>and</b> retention strategies.

This Framework is then applied to a study of undergraduate nurses’ career decision making, using a sequential explanatory mixed method study. The paper demonstrates the relevance of this approach for addressing challenges associated with nursing <b>recruitment,</b> education, <b>and</b> <b>career</b> choice...|$|R

40|$|The {{under-representation}} {{of women}} on faculties of science and engineering is ascribed in part to demographic inertia, which is the lag between retirement of current faculty and future hires. The assumption of demographic inertia implies that, given enough time, gender parity will be achieved. We examine that assumption via a semi-Markov model {{to predict the future}} faculty, with simulations that predict the convergence demographic state. Our model shows that existing practices that produce gender gaps in <b>recruitment,</b> retention, <b>and</b> <b>career</b> progression preclude eventual gender parity. Further, we examine sensitivity of the convergence state to current gender gaps to show that all sources of disparity across the entire faculty career must be erased to produce parity: we cannot blame demographic inertia...|$|R

We conducted 90 in-depth interviews, 86 with doctors from six districts and four at the state level to explore the perceptions of doctors about these policies. Results Despite the efforts by the Government of Odisha through regular recruitments, a quarter of the posts of doctors was vacant across all institutional levels in the state. The majority of doctors interviewed were unaware of existing government rules for placement, transfer and promotion. In addition, there were no explicit rules followed in placement and transfer.
