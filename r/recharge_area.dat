25|$|The rate {{at which}} {{recharge}} water enters the aquifer is limited by several factors. Much of the plains region is semiarid, with steady winds that hasten evaporation of surface water and precipitation. In many locations, the aquifer is overlain, in the vadose zone, with a shallow layer of caliche that is practically impermeable; this limits {{the amount of water}} able to recharge the aquifer from the land surface. However, the soil of the playa lakes is different and not lined with caliche, making these some of the few areas where the aquifer can recharge. The destruction of playas by farmers and development decreases the available <b>recharge</b> <b>area.</b> The prevalence of the caliche is partly due to the ready evaporation of soil moisture and the semiarid climate; the aridity increases the amount of evaporation, which in turn increases the amount of caliche in the soil. Both mechanisms reduce the amount of recharge water that reaches the water table.|$|E

2500|$|The {{borough of}} Tláhuac {{is located in}} the southeastern part of the Federal District of Mexico City, about 60 km from the {{historic}} center of Mexico City [...] It is bordered by the boroughs of Iztapalapa, Milpa Alta and Xochimilco as well as the municipality of Valle de Chalco Solidaridad in the State of Mexico [...] The borough extends over 89.5.km2 of territory, accounting for 5.75% of the Federal District. The borough is part of the Valley of Mexico, in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt that extends across central Mexico. The borough expands over much of the former Lake Chalco and Lake Xochimilco where the two connected, which were drained over the centuries since the Spanish conquest. The territory is classified into three zones, flat lakebed, transitional areas and hills with accumulated volcanic materials. The main elevations include the Guadalupe Volcano, the Xaltepec Volcano, Tecuautzi, Tetecón, the Sierra de Santa Catarina and Teuhtli Volcano. The Sierra de Santa Catarina is a small volcanic belt which has elevations of up to 2,800 meters above sea level. It serves as an important aquifer <b>recharge</b> <b>area</b> as well as a barrier to urban sprawl from Iztapalapa on the other side.

Thus, for every hectare built up, the water for 500 families are lost and the pressure on groundwater increases further.

40|$|High <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> {{significantly}} {{influence the}} groundwater {{quality and quantity}} in regional groundwater systems. Many studies have applied recharge potential analysis (RPA) to estimate groundwater recharge potential (GRP) and have delineated high <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> based on the estimated GRP. However, most of these studies define the RPA parameters with supposition, and this represents {{a major source of}} uncertainty for applying RPA. To objectively define the RPA parameter values without supposition, this study proposes a systematic method based on the theory of parameter identification. A surrogate variable, namely the average storage variation (ASV) index, is developed to calibrate the RPA parameters, {{because of the lack of}} direct GRP observations. The study results show that the correlations between the ASV indexes and computed GRP values improved from 0. 67 before calibration to 0. 85 after calibration, thus indicating that the calibrated RPA parameters represent the recharge characteristics of the study area well; these data also highlight how defining the RPA parameters with ASV indexes can help to improve the accuracy. The calibrated RPA parameters were used to estimate the GRP distribution of the study area, and the GRP values were graded into five levels. High and excellent level areas are defined as high <b>recharge</b> <b>areas,</b> which composed 7. 92 % of the study area. Overall, this study demonstrates that the developed approach can objectively define the RPA parameters and high <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> of the Choushui River alluvial fan, and the results should serve as valuable references for the Taiwanese government in their efforts to conserve the groundwater quality and quantity of the study area...|$|R

This article presents the findings of a research based on the application of remote sensing technology and auxiliary data for the identification of groundwater <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> in the Paraíba do Sul river basin, State of São Paulo, Brazil. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a series of georreferenced geologic information and a sequence of hydrogeologic analysis to determine the location and distribution of <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> for future conservation purposes. The results indicate the distribution of five categories of potential <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> based on lineament characteristics, fracture bundles, and fracture density analysis. The top three categories should be considered as having the higher percolation quality and infiltration capacity, therefore higher potential for groundwater recharge. Significantly different results were obtained for the two major portions of the study area, crystalline rocks and unconsolidated sedimentary material, this fact hampered the development of hydrogeologic correlations for the entire basin.

Mapping over an eight year period that covered twenty-four 7. 5 ” quadrangles was funded, in part, by the U. S. Geological Survey’s STATEMAP program. In addition to classical field mapping, interpretive geologic maps of each quadrangle were derived and developed as GIS coverages. Field observations suggest the aquifer <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> are more complex than previous studies of ideal geologic sections. Several periods of extensive weathering and erosion in the geologic record, particularly in the current <b>recharge</b> <b>areas</b> of the Upper Floridan, Claiborne, Clayton and Cretaceous aquifers, have resulted in removal of portions of the stratigraphic units that host these aquifers, removal of portions of the confining units, and adversely altered the porosity and permeability of the updip portions of these aquifers.
