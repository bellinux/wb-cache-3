The objective {{of this paper is to}} develop guidelines for analyzing the measurement of longitudinal pavement profile using two dynamic segmentation methods and to demonstrate the benefits of refining the monitoring of pavement conditions. In the Canadian Long-Term Pavement Performance database, C-LTPP, a <b>representative</b> <b>average</b> <b>value</b> of the international roughness index (IRI) is stored for each of the longitudinal profiles. However, for maintenance work, it is useful to store the changes in roughness at a higher level of detail. The roughness profiles for all C-LTPP sections are calculated based on a constant base length. The roughness profiles have been analyzed to evaluate the effect of localization of roughness values. The IRI range, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum IRI is calculated for each of the 1332 roughness profiles. It is found that most of the monitored profiles have an IRI range that exceeds 1. 0 m/km. These high ranges mean that the average IRI for a section is not sufficient to give detailed information about how rough the section is. Fo...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{extensive}} {{database of}} atomic displacement cascades in iron {{has been developed}} using the method of molecular dynamics (MD). More than 300 simulations have been completed at 100 K with energies between 0. 1 and 100 keV. This encompasses nearly all energies relevant to fission reactor irradiation environments since a 100 keV MD cascade corresponds to the average iron cascade following a collision with a 5. 1 MeV neutron. Extensive statistical analysis of the database has determined <b>representative</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> for several primary damage parameters: {{the total number of}} surviving point defects, the fraction of the surviving point defects contained in clusters formed during cascade cooling, and a measure of the size distribution of the in-cascade point defect clusters. The cascade energy dependence of the MD-based primary damage parameters has been used to obtain spectrum-averaged defect production cross sections for typical fission reactor neutron energy spectra as a function of depth through the reactor pressure vessel. The attenuation of the spectrum-averaged cross sections for total point defect survival and the fraction of either interstitials or vacancies in clusters are quite similar to that for the NRT dpa. However, the cross sections derived to account for the energy dependence of the point defect cluster size distributions exhibit a potentially significant variation through the vessel. The production rate of large interstitial clusters decreases more rapidly than dpa whereas the production of large vacancy clusters is slower than dpa...|$|R

Unlike earlier studies, particular {{attention was paid to}} the anisotropy of the dielectric properties. The measurements were performed in the frame of polarimetric scattering, and imaging experiments conducted on both trees in the European Microwave Signature Laboratory (EMLS), Space Applications Institute, Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. They will be used, together with carefully established architectural models of the trees, to validate forest remote-sensing algorithms. The measurement method was based on an open-ended coaxial probe reflection technique with a rational function approximation model for the probe tip aperture admittance. With this model, no calibration on reference liquids is requiredand sufficiently accurate results for the dieletric constant and loss factor can be obtained. Results are presented for branches, parts of the trunks, and needles from different tree heights. Values obtained with the probe oriented along different stem directions of the trunk coafirm the anisotropic nature of wood. The longitudinal complex permittivity is roughly 1. 5 -three times higher than the transverse component. Inside the trunk, early and late wood layers and small heterogeneities give rise to fluctuations; the pholem layer and the new needled have the highest complex permittivity. <b>representative</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> for trunks, branches, and needles for modeling purposes are also given.

Furthermore, the uncertainty and spatial variation of the design parameters increase as the tunnel scale increases. Consequently, the probability of failure also increases. In order to achieve structural stability in large-section tunnels, the design framework must take into consideration the quantitative effect of design parameter variations on tunnel behavior. Therefore, this paper suggests a statistical approach to numerical modeling to explore the effect of spatially distributed design parameters in a circular tunnel.

40|$|The {{retrofit}} of {{a building}} or HVAC system with energy savings technologies requires upfront analysis to determine the potential for savings and post-retrofit analysis to verify the savings. The focus of this research project was {{in the development and}} evaluation of methods for analyzing demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) retrofits on smaller scale commercial buildings. The analysis of a DCV control retrofit requires predictions of CO 2 levels in the occupied zones, building thermal characteristics and HVAC equipment performance. ^ Methods for determining CO 2 levels in occupied zones were developed and evaluated for forward simulation and calibrated simulation modeling approaches. A quasi-equilibrium model was found to be sufficient for analysis of the energy savings potential with a DCV retrofit. A methodology was developed for estimating schedules for CO 2 generation rates and flow parameters using short-term testing. The method determines <b>representative</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of occupancy for each hour and statistics that characterizes day-to-day variations. Benefits are shown with the use of tuned models for the evaluation of DCV retrofit potential. Training periods of only two days to one week are sufficient for estimating energy cost differences between pre- and post-retrofits for economic evaluation of DCV. However, longer training data periods of up to eight weeks might be necessary if the goal is to make accurate absolute predictions for a given site for detailed engineering evaluations or performance measurement and verification of a retrofit. A site with higher variability in occupancy levels, such as a restaurant, might require a minimum of eight weeks of training data to accurately model the CO 2 levels in the zone. Expressed in terms of the coefficient of variation, errors in predicted CO 2 concentrations ranged from 4 % to 35 % depending on the sites and length of training data period. The predicted frequency of time that CO 2 concentrations were within a given range agreed well with field measured data. Improvements in the coefficient of variance for overall HVAC cooling power usage averaged 20. 0 %, and ranged from 2. 3 % to 79. 2 %. No advantage was found in using day-to-day variations in occupancy compared to using <b>average</b> hourly <b>values</b> when analyzing energy savings potential. ...|$|R

All available phosphate data were grouped into subsets <b>representative</b> of <b>averaged</b> <b>values</b> of the measured vertical profiles in the surface and deep water layers. In contrast to earlier predictions, the statistical analysis of the phosphate concentrations in a deep water layer does not indicate any particular trend in time for the last 30 years. These data sets were then used as an input to an inverse model and a 3 D primitive equation model (PEM). The former redistributes the measured concentrations by means of a variational principle and reconstructs average horizontal space distributions of the phosphate data fields as gridded solutions over the whole area. The spatial and temporal distributions thus obtained are visualised graphically and compared with other existing data, providing the first overall view of phosphate in the whole Mediterranean Sea and revealing an increasing oligotrophy towards the eastern basin. The primitive equation model is then used to assess the variability and upwelling fluxes. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Causes of death were cardiac in 37 (77 %), pulmonary in 3 (0. 7 %), vascular in 2 (0. 5 %) and infective in 2 (0. 5 %) patients, respectively. During the study a total of 1126 patients were operated upon in the collaborative Centers with the diagnosis of coronary artery disease and 51 deaths were reported officially in-hospital (4. 53 %). Therefore, OP-RISK data represent 87 % of overall patients and a superposable death rate. The potential role as risk factors of early mortality was assessed univariately for 17 preoperative, 5 operative (in 3 cases for the first time) and 5 postoperative factors. In general, {{it was confirmed that}} factors defining left ventricular function are sensitive predictors of mortality. In OP-RISK we were able to show, in addition, that tachycardia (> 130 b/min) at induction of anesthesia, and total time of anesthesia, cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross clamping may be significant factors among operative variables as might be among postoperative ones several arrhythmia types or a lower rate in antithrombotic therapy with aspirin at 6 - 12 hours postoperatively. The protective role of bypass surgery performed with at least 1 arterial segment was also ascertained. Most of these potential factors were significantly related to outcome (either directly or inversely) as were among them, as seen in a subsample (65 %) of 639 patients in whom a correlation matrix was performed among 16 factors {{selected on the basis of}} the common denominator principle. Our results suggest that it is possible to collect in a multicenter experience univariate predictors of early mortality following aortocoronary bypass surgery in Italy, which are not different from those reported from previous studies performed abroad. Operative indicators may also have predictive capabilities. The effort may be worthwhile and demands further cooperative studies to be undertaken, aimed at obtaining nationwide coefficients of risk along with <b>representative</b> <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of factors that soon might emerge once multivariate statistics will be performed on this material...|$|R

In this study, we apply a locally validated method for estimating aboveground woody biomass (AGWB) from Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array-type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data to produce an AGWB map for the lowland pine savannas of Belize at a spatial resolution of 100 m. Over 90 % of these woodlands are predicted to have an AGWB below 60 tha− 1, with the average woody biomass of these savannas estimated at 23. 5 tha− 1.

The predicted average biomass, from the mapping for savannas woodlands occurring within two of Belize’s larger protected areas, agree closely with previous biomass estimates for these areas based on ground surveys and forest inventories (error ≤ 20 %). However, biomass estimates derived for these protected areas from two biomass maps produced at coarser resolutions (500 m and 1000 m) from global datasets overestimated biomass (errors ≥ 275 % in each dataset).

These findings suggest that where sufficient ground data exists to build a reliable local relationship to radar backscatter, the more detailed biomass mapping that can be produced from ALOS and similar satellite data at resolutions of ~ 100 m provides more accurate and spatially detailed information that is more appropriate for supporting the management of forested areas of ~ 10, 000 ha than biomass maps that can be produced from lower resolution, but freely available global data sets...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to detect motor development, body size and body {{composition}} of children aged 7 and 10 years. From the measured data were selected <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of body height, body weight, the circumference of waist and hips and these values were compared with the <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of the previous research. The selected values of body composition were obtained thanks to Bodystat device. The <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of forced vital capacity were obtained thanks to spirometer device and the <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of Ruffierova's test were selected as well. The results of motor tests were also compared with the previous research. All obtained values are summarized in tables and graphs...|$|R
30|$|We {{repeated}} {{each instance}} of the experiment 30 times and then calculate an <b>average</b> <b>value</b> based on the 30 results. All the curves in the figures thus represent the <b>average</b> <b>values</b> of {{the results from the}} experiment.|$|R
