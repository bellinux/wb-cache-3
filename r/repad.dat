40|$|Abstract We have {{recently}} conducted a statistical survey on pitch angle distributions of energetic electrons {{trapped in the}} Earth 2 ̆ 7 s outer radiation belt, and a new empirical model was developed based upon survey results. This model - relativistic electron pitch angle distribution (<b>REPAD)</b> - aims to present statistical pictures of electron equatorial pitch angle distributions, instead of the absolute flux levels, {{as a function of}} energy, L shell, magnetic local time, and magnetic activity. To quantify and facilitate this statistical survey, we use Legendre polynomials to fit long-term in situ directional fluxes observed near the magnetic equator from three missions: CRRES, Polar, and LANL- 97 A. As the first of this kind of model, <b>REPAD</b> covers the whole outer belt region, providing not only the mean and median pitch angle distributions in the area but also error estimates of the average distributions. Preliminary verification and validation results demonstrate the reliable performance of this model. Usage of <b>REPAD</b> is mainly to predict the full pitch angle distribution of fluxes along a given magnetic field line, or even on a given drift shell, based upon one single unidirectional or omnidirectional flux measurement anywhere on that field line. This can be particularly useful for data assimilation, which usually has large tolerance on data errors. In addition, relatively small variations in pitch angle distributions measured at L shell between?∼? 4 and 5 justify the assumption of fixed pitch angle distributions at GPS equatorial crossings (L?∼? 4. 2) used in our previous studies...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a referenced Electrochemical Paper-based Analytical Device (<b>rEPAD)</b> comprising a sample zone, a reference zone, and a connecting microfluidic channel that includes a central contact zone. We demonstrated that the rEPADs provide a simple system for direct and accurate voltammetric measurements that are referenced by an electrode with a constant, well-defined potential. The performance of the rEPADs is comparable to commercial electrochemical cells, and the layout can be easily integrated into systems that permit multiplexed analysis and pipette-free sampling. The cost of this portable device is sufficiently low that it could be for single-use, disposable applications, and its method of fabrication is compatible with that used for other paper-based systems...|$|E

Three regimens used viral vectors (prime or boost) and two regimens used plasmid DNA. Analysis at necropsy showed that the DNA-based vaccine regimens elicited significantly higher cellular responses against Gag and Env {{than any of the}} other vaccine platforms. The T cell responses induced by most vaccine regimens disseminated systemically into secondary lymphoid tissues (lymph nodes, spleen) and effector anatomical sites (including liver, vaginal tissue), indicative of their role in viral containment at the portal of entry. The cellular and reported humoral immune response data suggest that combination of DNA and viral vectors elicits a balanced immunity with strong and durable responses able to disseminate into relevant mucosal sites...|$|E

Ragged had been the seat {{of it on the}} day when she first went to live with him, but very early on the {{following}} morning, or, to be precise, five minutes after daybreak, he had risen to see if there were burglars in the parlour, and behold, it was his grateful little maid <b>repadding</b> the old arm-chair. How a situation repeats itself! Without disturbing her, the old doctor had slipped away with a full heart. It was what the young doctor did now.|$|R

UT inspection discovered four regions of localized metal loss on the internal surface of a CO 2 absorber vessel shell. Of the four regions, two were directly adjacent to major structural discontinuities, including two nozzles, one of which contained a reinforcing plate or <b>repad.</b> In order to define the critical locations of metal loss and estimate a corrosion rate, thickness data for the regions of metal loss was provided {{in the form of}} 1 inch by 1 inch equally-spaced, rectangular thickness grid from two separate inspection dates. Based on the estimated corrosion rate, and the specified operation interval, the rate of metal loss was determined to be significant enough to require repair. This conclusion was {{based on the fact that}} in certain locations, the metal loss was estimated to grow through-wall before the end of the specified operation interval. Computational analysis using guidelines per API 579 - 1 /ASME FFS- 1 [1] was used to evaluate an appropriate repair procedure. This included evaluation of repair plate placement and sizing using advanced modeling techniques including elastic-plastic material behavior and contact interaction. The effect of future metal loss was included based the estimated corrosion rate. The result of this assessment was a repair design that provided sufficient protection against excessive plastic deformation and allowed for continued operation through the specified operating interval. Thus, repairing the vessel based on fitness-for-service (FFS) criteria allowed for continued use of the vessel and avoided costly replacement. The lessons learned provide insight into the improved design of vessel repairs...|$|E
