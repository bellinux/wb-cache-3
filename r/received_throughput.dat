We note that Algorithms 2 and 3 offer much reduced level of algorithmic computational complexity, and that Algorithm 3 entails a fully distributed implementation. For all three algorithms, we observe that as the number of clients over a prescribed area of coverage increases, an increasing number of time slots per frame is required. However, the corresponding reduction in per-user throughput rate attained under each algorithm becomes much less noticeable with further increases in client population. The synthesized schedules tend to more fully cover the complete geographical area of operation, so that multicast schedules performed to accommodate a larger number of clients will then more often also cover new clients.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently, the {{application}} of the peer to peer networking paradigm (typical for an ad hoc network) has been proposed for wireless local area networks (WLANs), instead of the traditional cellular networking paradigm. In this paper the performance of a WLAN employing the peer to peer networking paradigm is studied via simulations; the results indicate that the direct application of the peer to peer networking paradigm in a WLAN leads to a substantially decreased throughput for the traffic directed to the Access Point (AP). The study also reveals that the cumulative <b>receiving</b> <b>throughput</b> of nodes located at the periphery of relatively small circular areas around the AP is substantially higher. Thus, the capacity of the multihop cellular network may be enhanced by employing the peer to peer paradigm only outside a circular area around the AP and the cellular paradigm inside this circular area. Examples are provided of environments where the aforementioned idea of distributing the traditional AP functionality to a set of nodes at the periphery of a circular area around the AP can be effectively applied. ...|$|R

We show that, with careful socket buffer sizing, a bulk TCP transfer can saturate a network path independent of the BDP or the available network buffers. In a non-congested path, {{there is a certain}} socket buffer size (which depends on the cross traffic type) that maximizes the throughput of a bulk TCP transfer.

40|$|Abstract — It {{is often}} claimed that TCP {{is not a}} {{suitable}} transport protocol for data intensive Grid applications in high-performance networks. We argue {{that this is not}} necessarily the case. Without changing the TCP protocol, congestion control, or implementation, we show that an appropriately tuned TCP bulk transfer can saturate the available bandwidth of a network path. The proposed technique, called SOBAS, is based on automatic socket buffer sizing at the application layer. In non-congested paths, SOBAS limits the socket buffer size based on direct measurements of the <b>received</b> <b>throughput</b> and of the corresponding round-trip time. The key idea is that the send window should be limited, after the transfer has saturated the available bandwidth in the path, so that the transfer does not cause buffer overflows (“self-induced losses”). A difference with other socket buffer sizing schemes is that SOBAS does not require prior knowledge of the path characteristics, and it can be performed while the transfer is in progress. Experimental results in several high bandwidth-delay product paths show that SOBAS provides consistently a significant throughput increase (20 % to 80 %) compared to TCP transfers that use the maximum possible socket buffer size. We expect that SOBAS will be mostly useful for applications such as GridFTP in noncongested wide-area networks...|$|E

AODV is popular Ad-hoc distance vector routing reactive protocol which is used to find correct & shortest route to destination. Due to openness, dynamic, infrastructure-less nature, MANET are vulnerable to various attacks. One of these possible attacks is a Black Hole Attack in which a mobile node falsely replies to the source node that it is having a shortest path to the destination without checking its routing table. Therefore source node send all of its data to the black hole node and it deprives all the traffic of the source node.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} impact of network load in the {{neighboring}} sectors on the inter-cell interference in a cellular data network. The signal received by a user over the forward link in such a system contains interference from the neighboring base stations. We note that {{the strength of this}} interference {{is a function of the}} network load in the neighboring cells. We obtain an expression for the received SINR (Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio) as a function of the traffic load in the interfering cells. Using this result, we propose an improvement to the conservative pilotbased SINR estimation scheme that is implemented in the current cellular data networks. The proposed scheme provides a more accurate estimate of the user SINR by taking better account of the contribution of inter-cell interference. It builds on top of the current SINR measurement scheme by using a combination of pilot measurement and traffic load measurement. With the proposed scheme, a terminal reports a less conservative data rate, and hence it <b>receives</b> a higher <b>throughput.</b> The scheme especially benefits the “poor ” users, i. e., the users that <b>receive</b> low <b>throughput</b> because they are located far from the base station.
