Also in 2000, the ACLU lost the Boy Scouts of America v.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{usefulness}} of the feminist theory in explaining atti- tudes toward <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> victims of <b>rape</b> in Ghana. The feminist theory of rape posits, inter alia, that patriarchy and gender inequality are major factors in the aetiology of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> attitudes toward <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> that underlying patriarchy and gender inequality are gender stereotypes and false beliefs (myths) about <b>rape,</b> rapists, <b>and</b> victims of <b>rape.</b> Thus, the theory suggests a relationship between <b>rape</b> myths <b>and</b> less favorable attitudes toward <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> victims of <b>rape.</b> Results from a survey conducted in Ghana show some support for the feminist theory of rape: There is evidence of rape myth acceptance in Ghana; gender is significant in predicting levels of <b>rape</b> myth acceptance; <b>and</b> finally, education or profession and age, but not religion, are associated with levels of rape myth acceptance in a predictable way...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores factors, influences, <b>and</b> {{causes of}} <b>rape</b> through social constructivist and feminist lenses, and makes {{recommendations}} for improving sex education to address <b>and</b> challenge <b>rape</b> myths <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture in general. The ultimate {{aim is to}} promote education {{in order to reduce}} rape. I review the literature related to <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture in order to identify factors and influences contributing to rape-supportive beliefs and behaviours in society at large, including the ways in which women's lives are impacted by the constant threat of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> how male socialization contributes to and normalizes this threat. Based on discourse and content analyses of online comments on articles related to <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture, <b>and</b> with reference to Ontario's most recent Health and Physical Education curriculum documents for grades 9 and 10 (Ontario Ministry of Education and Training, 1999), I make specific recommendations for how to better-educate boys and men about their roles and responsibilities in ending <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> mitigating <b>rape</b> culture...|$|R

5|$|In Asia and the Pacific, between 3 {{million and}} more than 10 million civilians, mostly Chinese (estimated at 7.5 million), {{were killed by the}} Japanese {{occupation}} forces. The best-known Japanese atrocity was the Nanking Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were <b>raped</b> <b>and</b> murdered. Mitsuyoshi Himeta reported that 2.7 million casualties occurred during the Sankō Sakusen. General Yasuji Okamura implemented the policy in Heipei and Shantung.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg {{was created by the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using DNA {{evidence}} in pre-1990 rape or murder cases. This led to the review of 240 other convictions. The CCRC also requested that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA testing was available. In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had <b>raped</b> <b>and</b> killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988.|$|E
5|$|Carrington and Johnson {{speculated that}} Leigh was {{assaulted}} {{by the group}} of boys after returning from the beach, as punishment for complaining about being <b>raped,</b> <b>and</b> was murdered by Webster and two others {{because they were afraid}} she would tell other people. They refused to specifically name the two other suspects for fear of legal repercussions, though clarified that one had sexually assaulted Leigh earlier in the night, and the other likely sexually assaulted her with a beer bottle before she died, as punishment for publicly refusing to have sex with him. Webster talked to the media about the murder {{for the first time in}} 1997, and insisted that he acted alone in killing Leigh.|$|E
40|$|The {{following}} text {{is taken}} from the publisher's website: "This work explores and untangles the theme of <b>rape,</b> <b>and</b> its counterpart ravishment, in Anglo-French cultural tradition between {{the disintegration of the}} classical world and the Renaissance. Tracing debate and dialogue across intellectual and literary discourses, Corinne Saunders places Middle English literary portrayals of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> ravishment in the context of shifting legal, theological and medical attitudes. The treatment of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> ravishment is considered across a wide range of literary genres: hagiography, where female saints are repeatedly threatened with rape; legendary history, as in the stories of Lucretia and Helen; and romance, where acts of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> ravishment challenge and shape chivalric order, and romance heroes are conceived through rape. Finally, the ways in which Malory and Chaucer write <b>and</b> rewrite <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> ravishment are examined. ...|$|R

David nearly drowns (since he cannot swim), but the children rescue him. He then attacks the janitor from behind and strangles him to death while once more remaining uninjured. That night, he and Audrey reconcile. The following morning, he secretly shows a newspaper article on the anonymous heroic act, featuring a sketch of David in his hooded rain poncho, to his son, who recognizes the hero as his father.|$|E
5|$|His government's {{treatment}} of non-Arab Libyans has also {{came in for}} criticism from human rights activists, with native Berbers, Italians, Jews, refugees, and foreign workers all facing persecution in Gaddafist Libya. Human rights groups also criticized the {{treatment of}} migrants, including asylum seekers, who passed through Gaddafi's Libya {{on their way to}} Europe. According to journalist Annick Cojean and psychologist Seham Sergewa, Gaddafi and senior officials <b>raped</b> <b>and</b> imprisoned hundreds or thousands of young women and reportedly raped several of his female bodyguards. Gaddafi's actions in promoting foreign militant groups, although regarded by him as a justifiable support for national liberation movements, was seen by the United States as interference in the domestic affairs of other nations and active support for international terrorism.|$|E

Stuart's lawyer claimed that the confession was forced, and appeals to the Supreme and High Courts were dismissed. A linguist who investigated the case thought that the style of English in the confession was inconsistent with Stuart's background and speech. This aroused disquiet and objections against the fairness of the trial among an increasing number of legal academics and judges, and The News brought much attention to Stuart's plight with an aggressive, tabloid-style campaign. Soon, the case attracted international attention, some on the assumption that the legal system was racist. The former High Court Justice Sir John Latham also spoke out.|$|E
5|$|Brady and Hindley {{visited a}} {{fairground}} on 26 December 1964, {{in search of}} another victim, and noticed 10-year-old Lesley Ann Downey standing beside one of the rides. When {{it became apparent that}} she was on her own, they approached her and deliberately dropped some of the shopping they were carrying close to her, before asking for the girl's help to carry some of the packages to their car, and then to their home. Once inside the house Downey was undressed, gagged and forced to pose for photographs before being <b>raped</b> <b>and</b> killed, perhaps strangled with a piece of string. Hindley maintained that she went to fill a bath for the child and found the girl dead (presumably killed by Brady) when she returned. In Chris Cowley's book Face to Face with Evil: Conversations with Ian Brady, Brady states that it was Hindley who killed Downey. The following morning Brady and Hindley drove with Downey's body to Saddleworth Moor, where she was buried, naked with her clothes at her feet, in a shallow grave.|$|E

Returning home, Lohan and the film crew are chased by paparazzi photographers at the airport. Two months later, Lohan is in London, England talking to Kate Redman, from Save the Children UK, who describes how one of the issues with government intervention is that only sex and drug trafficking is illegal. She also advocates raising awareness of the issues with trafficking.|$|E

40|$|In this dissertation, {{the focus}} will be on the {{representation}} of <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture within contemporary fiction; the aim of this is to discover how prevalent <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture is within this particular area. The thesis is split into three chapters, the first of which discusses the depictions of male <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> gender shifts in contemporary fiction, focusing on Lisbeth Salander as a rapist in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The second chapter follows on from this, discussing the portrayal of victims of rape within contemporary fiction; and the last chapter debates whether or not a perpetuating rape culture means that women cannot be as sexually experimental as they wish to be. The aim of the dissertation is to focus on how authors depict <b>rape,</b> <b>and</b> whether or not this depiction is perpetuating rape culture, or simply addressing the issue within fiction. 	The introduction is a larger part of the dissertation, setting up exactly what <b>rape</b> <b>and</b> <b>rape</b> culture is, <b>and</b> how <b>rape</b> myths prevail in modern western society. There are certain areas that the dissertation has not addressed, such as race, because they are such complex issues that merely by giving them a single chapter within the dissertation would not be enough. The dissertation’s main purpose, and main area of focus, is to illustrate the perpetuating rape culture in western societies through gender inequality...|$|R
5|$|The Red Army {{initiated}} {{an offensive}} into East Prussia in October 1944, {{but it was}} temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes {{had taken place in}} East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had been <b>raped</b> <b>and</b> killed by the advancing Soviets. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of fanaticising civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. A Nazi information campaign about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack by two men. Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who <b>raped</b> <b>and</b> strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E
5|$|The {{narrative}} of Miracle Day focuses on {{an event in}} which death ceases to occur across {{the world and the}} gravely-wounded continue to remain alive. On the first day of this phenomenon, the so-called Miracle Day, Oswald, a former schoolteacher who molested, <b>raped,</b> <b>and</b> murdered one of his students, survives his own execution. His survival draws global attention, and he subsequently is released from prison on a legal technicality. After being offered both exposure and protection by Public Relations expert Jilly Kitzinger (Lauren Ambrose), he becomes her client, which helps him gain more publicity. Following a series of events he ends up aiding Torchwood, a team composed of two former alien-hunters and two former CIA agents, on their mission to restore death to the world. Danes is killed off in the final episode of the series; when death is restored he takes one of the Torchwood team's enemies out in a murder–suicide.|$|E
