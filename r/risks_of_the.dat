5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, {{it is imperative that}} the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents come to a decision about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E

Some important axiomatic characterizations <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> measures are reviewed, including a characterization of a correspondence between <b>risk</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first kind and <b>risk</b> measures <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second kind.

Gaga also contributes {{in the fight against}} HIV and AIDS, focusing on educating young women about the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease. In collaboration with Cyndi Lauper, Gaga joined forces with MAC Cosmetics to launch a line of lipstick under their supplementary cosmetic line, Viva Glam. Sales have raised more than $202 million to fight HIV and AIDS.|$|E
5|$|Rhodri Morgan, Assembly Member (AM) {{replaced}} Alun Michael AM, {{to become}} the First Secretary (now known as the First Minister) of the National Assembly on 15 February 2000.

The review included the costs and construction <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new building, the timetable for the completion of the project and consideration of possible alternatives to the new building.|$|E
5|$|These {{advantages}} {{offset the}} high stress, physical exertion costs, and other <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, {{has a very}} late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. A similar strategy is adopted by the greater noctule bat, which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants. The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens, which require a heightened immune response.|$|E

5|$|In November 1860, Tubman {{conducted}} {{her last}} rescue mission. Throughout the 1850s, Tubman {{had been unable}} to effect the escape of her sister, Rachel, and Rachel's two children, Ben and Angerine. Upon returning to Dorchester County, Tubman discovered that Rachel had died, and the children could be rescued only if she could pay a US$30 bribe. She had no money, so the children remained enslaved. Their fates remain unknown. Never one to waste a trip, Tubman gathered another group, including the Ennalls family, ready and willing to take the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> journey north. It took them weeks to safely get away because of slave catchers, forcing them to hide out longer than expected. The weather was unseasonably cold and they had little food. The children were drugged with paregoric to keep them quiet while slave patrols rode by. They safely reached the home of David and Martha Wright in Auburn, New York, on December 28, 1860.|$|E
5|$|Sir Nathaniel Dance (20 June 1748 – 25 March 1827) was {{an officer}} of the Honourable East India Company who had a long and varied career on {{merchant}} vessels, making numerous voyages to India and back with the fleets of East Indiamen. He was already aware of the <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> valuable ships he sailed on being preyed on by foreign navies, having been captured by a Franco-Spanish fleet in 1780 during the East Indies campaign of the American War of Independence. His greatest achievement came during the Napoleonic Wars, when having been appointed commodore of one of the company's fleets, he came across a French squadron under Rear-Admiral Comte de Linois, which was raiding British shipping in the area. Through skilful seamanship and aggressive tactics he fooled the French commander into thinking that the British convoy was escorted by powerful naval forces, and the French decided not to risk attacking the convoy. Dance compounded the deception by taking his lightly armed merchants and chasing the French away, despite the considerable disparity of force. Having saved the convoy from almost certain destruction, Dance was hailed as a hero, lavishly rewarded with money and a knighthood, and spent the last years of his life in comfortable retirement.|$|E
5|$|The act of premastication is {{commonly}} found in all human societies and populations, although it is less prevalent in some than others. The evolution and selective advantage of premastication behaviours is that it supplements the infant diet of breast milk by providing access to more macro- and micro-nutrients. Although disease can be transmitted through saliva in the pre-chewed foods, the benefits conferred outweighed any <b>risks</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> practice during the evolution of human behaviour. Furthermore, discouraging premastication as prevention to disease transmittion may prove as disastrous an infant public health policy as when infants breastfeeding was discouraged in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the end, the potential benefits and pitfalls of this practice greatly depend on the dietary and medical circumstances of the mother and child. The true scope {{of the benefits of}} premastication and its prevalences in differenct societies is still under active research, though there appears to be some consensus on the nutritional benefits of the practice.|$|E

The increase in equity risk is surprisingly small after a recapitalization, ranging from 28 % to 52 % depending on the estimation method. Under the assumption that total company risk is unchanged, <b>the</b> implied systematic <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> post-recapitalization debt in twelve transactions averages 0. 67. Under the alternative assumption that the entire market adjusted premium in the leveraged recapitalization represents a reduction in fixed costs, <b>the</b> implied systematic <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> this debt averages 0. 42. ...|$|R
