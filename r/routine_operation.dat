However, examination of the alarm and its circuit breaker in flight 5022 had not revealed any fault.|$|E

They were married at St Giles' Church, Shipbourne on 14 December 1932. His brother Victor was the best man. They had a son, Edward, and a daughter, Sheran. Leonora died in London on 16 May 1944 during a <b>routine</b> <b>operation.</b> Cazalet was given a few days leave to attend her funeral.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{employees}} per 1,000 connections is low in international comparison: It is 1.19 for water utilities and 0.62 for sewer utilities, totaling 1.81. It varies between 1.1 in Fukuoka to 2.5 in Kyoto. This is an indicator of high labor productivity. One reason why the figure is low is that activities such as <b>routine</b> <b>operation</b> and maintenance as well as metering and billing are often outsourced.

40|$|This sixth Annual Report {{presents}} and analyzes DOE Complex-wide waste generation and pollution prevention activities at 36 reporting sites from 1993 through 1997. In May 1996, the Secretary of Energy established a 50 percent Complex-Wide Waste Reduction Goal (relative to the 1993 baseline) for <b>routine</b> <b>operations</b> radioactive and hazardous waste generation, {{to be achieved}} by December 31, 1999. Excluding sanitary waste, <b>routine</b> <b>operations</b> waste generation increased three percent from 1996 to 1997, and decreased 61 percent overall from 1993 to 1997. DOE has achieved its Complex-Wide Waste Reduction Goals for <b>routine</b> <b>operations</b> based upon a comparison of 1997 waste generation to the 1993 baseline. However, {{it is important to}} note that increases in low-level radioactive and low-level mixed waste generation could reverse this achievement. From 1996 to 1997, low-level radioactive waste generation increased 10 percent, and low-level mixed waste generation increased slightly. It is critical that DOE sites continue to reduce <b>routine</b> <b>operations</b> waste generation for all waste types, to ensure that DOE`s Complex-Wide Waste Reduction Goals are achieved by December 31, 1999...|$|R

These systems are generally limited to intensively managed systems although research continues to match them to the requirements of grazing cattle and to develop sensors to detect animal health and fertility automatically. Every time the cow enters the milking unit she is fed concentrates and her collar is scanned to record production data.|$|E
25|$|Mates {{direct a}} ship's <b>routine</b> <b>operation</b> for the captain during work shifts, which are called watches. Mates stand watch for {{specified}} periods, usually in three duty sections, with 4 hours on watch and 8 hours off. When on a navigational watch, mates direct a bridge team by conning, directing courses through the helmsman and speed through the lee helmsman (or directly in open ocean). When {{more than one}} mate is necessary aboard a ship, they typically are designated chief mate or first mate, second mate and third mate. In addition to watch standers, mates directly supervise the ship's crew, and are assigned other tasks. The chief mate is usually in charge of cargo, stability and the deck crew, the second mate in charge of navigation plans and updates and the third mate as the safety officer. They also monitor and direct deck crew operations, such as directing line handlers during moorings, and anchorings, monitor cargo operations and supervise crew members engaged in maintenance and the vessel's upkeep.|$|E

Lady Byrne then discovers that the boss of Charles' charity has been investing cash instead of putting it to good use." [...] The hospital's Chief Executive Officer, Jayne Grayson, convinces her to take over as Executive Chairman of the charity. [...] "Jayne sees that she has the strength to run the show," [...] Asher explained. [...] "Lady Byrne is reluctant at first, but realises that she can do some good and keep the family name going - and she does a rather excellent job of it." [...] Asher was able to contribute to the storyline in the planning stages, due to her real-world experience with Asperger syndrome. [...] "As president of The National Autistic Society, Asperger's is something I've worked with for 25 years. When Holby approached the society about this plot concerning the boy with Asperger's syndrome, they said, 'Do you realise the woman involved in this storyline is our president?'. So I was able to help out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1912, Africa {{took part}} in {{aircraft}} experiments at Sheerness. She was fitted for flying off aircraft with a [...] downward-sloping runway which was installed on her foredeck, running over her forward 12-inch (305-mm) turret from her forebridge to her bows and equipped with rails to guide the aircraft. Africas crew tested the strength and stability of the rails by {{jumping up and down}} on them, then held the Gnome-engined Short Improved S.27 pusher seaplane in place as Lieutenant Charles Samson entered its cockpit to attempt the first British shipboard aircraft take-off on 10 January 1912 while the ship was at anchor in the River Medway. The aircraft moved quickly down the runway, dipped slightly after leaving it, but then pulled up and climbed easily. Samson circled Africa several times to the cheers of the crew, although on one pass he came uncomfortably close to the ship. After a few minutes, Samson climbed to [...] and concluded his historic flight by landing safely at an airfield ashore. Africa transferred her flight equipment to her sister ship [...] in May 1912. Based on the 1912 flight experiments on Africa, Hibernia, and battleship , the Royal Navy concluded that shipboard aircraft were desirable for spotting and other fleet duties, but also that a fixed runway on a battleship interfered too much with the firing of the guns and that recovering seaplanes that had landed in a seaway was too difficult to be practical as a <b>routine</b> <b>operation.</b> But shipborne aviation had begun in the Royal Navy aboard Africa, and by 1917 would become an important part of British fleet operations.|$|E

2500|$|During the 1950s, Houston-based {{surgeons}} such as Michael E. DeBakey and Denton Cooley were pioneering new {{heart surgery}} techniques, attracting a high volume of medical residents {{who wished to}} study under their tutelage. Realizing that the city would soon be awash with cardiac surgeons, Hill looked at alternative surgical careers, eventually opting for plastic surgery. At the time, only ten certified plastic surgeons were practicing in Houston, and Hill believed he could make {{more money in the}} profession. He was a popular member of the residency program, but almost had his medical career cut short after perforating a patient's bowel during a <b>routine</b> <b>operation,</b> then stitching the man up without repairing the damage. The patient later died of peritonitis, and Hill received a severe reprimand after an autopsy uncovered his mistake. Upon completing his residency, Hill was offered a partnership by Nathan Roth, a New York City-trained surgeon who had established himself in Houston, and he joined the practice in 1963. Hill's partnership with Roth got off to a difficult start after he failed to warn his first patient that a drill bit had broken off during a jaw repair operation, leaving it embedded in the patient's face. When challenged by Roth, Hill was apologetic about his error, saying he had been [...] "hesitant to mention this mistake on my very first case". Hill's brother, Julian, had committed suicide shortly before the incident, and Roth gave Hill {{the benefit of the doubt}} because of this. The partnership between Hill and Roth was dissolved in 1967 after Roth grew tired of the other surgeon's repeated requests that Roth cover for him so that he could give music recitals. Hill then established his own practice in the same building as his former business partner.|$|E

However, for the first time since 1994, the total amount of materials recycled by the Complex decreased from 109, 600 metric tons in 1997 to 92, 800 metric tons in 1998. This decrease is attributed to the fact that in 1997, several large ''one-time only'' recycling projects were conducted throughout the Complex. In order to demonstrate commitment to DOE's Complex-wide recycling goal, it is important for sites to identify all potential large-scale recycling/reuse opportunities...|$|R
