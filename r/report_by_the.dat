30|$|To {{calculate}} {{recall and}} precision, we considered that true positives are instances (classes or methods) {{present in the}} code smell reference list that are also <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tool being assessed. False positives are instances that are not present in the reference list, but they were <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tool. False negatives are instances present in the reference list that were not <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tool. Finally, true negatives are instances that are not present in the reference list and were also not <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tool. Therefore, recall {{is the number of}} true positives divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> number of instances in the reference list (true positives + false negatives), while precision in the number of true positives divided <b>by</b> <b>the</b> number of instances <b>reported</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> tool (true positives + false positives).|$|R
