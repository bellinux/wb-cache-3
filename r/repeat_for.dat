5|$|Due to the {{cancellation}} of Sonic X-treme, the Saturn lacks an exclusive Sonic the Hedgehog platformer, containing only a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis title Sonic 3D Blast, the compilation Sonic Jam, and a racing game called Sonic R. The platformer Bug! received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the Sonic series had. Considered {{one of the most}} important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed Nights into Dreams, a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of Nights involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels <b>repeat</b> <b>for</b> as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's Super Mario 64, Nights emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's Burning Rangers, a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{the first}} 35 minutes, there were {{technical}} difficulties with the Fort Worth TV relay {{as well as}} with the phone link MacNeil was using to report from the hospital. When the coverage began, McGee was waiting for MacNeil to call in with information. While Ryan and Huntley were recounting the information, McGee got MacNeil on the line and told him to recount chronologically what happened. However, NBC was using a studio that wasn't equipped to patch calls through to the air and thus only McGee could hear MacNeil. While the studio crew worked on a solution, McGee improvised and told MacNeil to relay the information in fragments, which he would then <b>repeat</b> <b>for</b> the audience. While they were talking, Huntley was handed a speaker from off camera and took the receiver from McGee so he could attach it to the earpiece, this enabling MacNeil to be heard. However, by that time there was no further information to report; MacNeil had a medical student from Parkland hold the phone line for him so that he could return to the emergency ward for the latest developments.|$|E

500|$|As well {{as making}} use of non-retrogradable rhythm and the Hindu decî-tâlas, Messiaen also {{composed}} with [...] "additive" [...] rhythms. This involves lengthening individual notes slightly or interpolating a short note into an otherwise regular rhythm (see Example 3), or shortening or lengthening every note of a rhythm by the same duration (adding a semiquaver to every note in a rhythm on its <b>repeat,</b> <b>for</b> example). This led Messiaen to use rhythmic cells that irregularly alternate between two and three units, a process that also occurs in Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which Messiaen admired.|$|E

Equally positive was Kristin Harris from Seventeen, who called it awesome and warned that listeners of the song may leave it [...] "on <b>repeat</b> <b>for</b> about 5 hours" [...] because it is catchy. Stephanie Ironson, an editor for Elite Daily, wrote an article about Timeflies appearing at the [...] "Billboard Hot 100 Fest" [...] in August 2016 and referred to [...] "All the Way" [...] as her favorite song by the group. Agreeing, AndPop's Kalyna Taras found that [...] "after only a couple listens", any individual will be [...] "singing along" [...] and [...] "tapping [...] feet".

500|$|... on July 15, 1936. Immediately {{upon arrival}} in Germany, Brundage became {{headline}} news {{when he and}} the AOC dismissed swimmer Eleanor Holm Jarrett, a gold medalist in 1932 and expected to <b>repeat,</b> <b>for</b> activities on shipboard. Rumors and accounts of the married swimmer's pursuits on board vary, but include statements that she was at an [...] "all-night party" [...] with playwright Charles MacArthur, who was traveling without his wife, actress Helen Hayes. Brundage discussed the matter with fellow AOC members, then met with Jarrett. Although the AOC attempted to send her home, Jarrett, after pleading in vain for reinstatement, remained in Berlin as a journalist, [...] "to the AOC's horror". In later years, she claimed that Brundage had kicked her off the team because he had propositioned her, and she had turned him down. According to Guttmann, [...] "Brundage has appeared, ever since , {{in the guise of}} a killjoy." [...] Butterfield noted that through the efforts of sportswriters who supported Jarrett, [...] "Brundage became celebrated as a tyrant, snob, hypocrite, dictator and stuffed shirt, as well as just about the meanest man in the whole world of sports".|$|E
500|$|Appalachian State was {{unanimously}} {{selected as}} the No. 1 team in the FCS football poll in the week after their victory against Michigan. Although several voters in the AP Poll stated {{they would like to}} vote for Appalachian State, the Mountaineers were ineligible to receive votes because the poll was only limited to FBS teams; in response, the AP amended their policy the following week to allow FCS teams to receive votes in the AP Poll. The Mountaineers received 19 points in the week 3 edition of the AP Poll and 5 points [...] in the week 4 edition of the AP Poll. The team also extended their winning streak to 17 games before losing to Wofford in week 5. Appalachian State lost to rival Georgia Southern in week 7, dropping them to 5–2 and 2–2 in the Southern Conference (SoCon), which placed them in a poor position to <b>repeat</b> <b>for</b> a third consecutive time as conference champions. However, the Mountaineers won all of their remaining regular season games to finish 9–2, and their 5–2 Southern Conference record was good enough to earn a share of the SoCon conference title with Wofford, but Wofford claimed the conference's automatic bid. As an at-large bid, the team scored a close win over James Madison (28–27) and then defeated Eastern Washington (38–35) in the first two rounds of the FCS playoffs, Appalachian State easily defeated Richmond (55–35) in the semifinals and Delaware (49–21) in the championship game, winning their third consecutive FCS National Championship. They became the first team to win three consecutive FCS titles, and the first Division I football team to win three consecutive titles since Army, who had won three straight titles from 1944 to 1946. At the end of the season, the Mountaineers became the first FCS team to receive votes in the final AP Poll. They received five votes, which placed Appalachian State at a tie for 34th overall with South Florida.|$|E
