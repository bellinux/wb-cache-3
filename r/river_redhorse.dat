50|$|The <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> resembles all redhorse species {{especially}} the shorthead redhorse (M. macrolepidotum) and the Greater Redhorse (M. valenciennesi). The <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> can be distinguished, although with difficulty, from most {{other members of}} the genus by its heavy pharyngeal arch with molariform teeth. Additional features that may distinguish it from other redhorse sucker species include entirely plicate lips and caudal peduncle scale count.|$|E
50|$|The Richelieu, {{which is}} {{home to more than}} 50 species of fish, offers {{excellent}} sport fishing opportunities. Important sport species include northern pike, longnose gar, bowfin, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, carp, and black crappie. But the Richelieu also hosts several threatened or endangered species, such as the copper redhorse, <b>river</b> <b>redhorse,</b> and lake sturgeon, so fishing seasons and capture limits are regulated.|$|E
50|$|The <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> (Moxostoma carinatum) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish endemic to {{the eastern half of}} the United States and southeastern Canada. Their weight ranges from 2-10 lbs. It is typically found in clear, large creeks and rivers, though it is sometimes also found in lakes. They are sometimes speared or caught with hook and line using crayfish or worms as bait.|$|E
50|$|Due to its sandy bottom, limited {{cover and}} dearth of deep pools, the Crow Wing {{is not a}} good game fish <b>river.</b> Shorthead <b>Redhorse</b> and White Sucker, both rough fish, are the river's most common species.|$|R
5000|$|A bottom-feeder, {{it feeds}} on mussels, snails, {{crustaceans}} and immature aquatic insects. Its common names include big-sawed sucker, <b>river</b> mullet, greater <b>redhorse,</b> redfin redhorse and redhorse sucker. It has the following characteristics: ...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{invasive}} species and increasing human presence {{are not only}} responsible for the fragility of some populations. According to {{a report from the}} Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks (MDDEP) conducted in 1998, the presence of pollutants and toxic agents in the waters of the river is also a [...] "stressful" [...] for fish. In several places in the river, a disturbing proportion of fish (over 13%) had abnormalities, which would signal a [...] "precarious state of health" [...] of the community ichthyological. However, the significant presence of fish-eating fish and some vulnerable species such as banded killifish, brought MDDEP to maintain the integrity index fish [...] "average" [...] (except in the Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, where he was considered [...] "low"). Chub black chin, stonecat and lamprey East are also part of sentinel species in the watershed of the Richelieu <b>River,</b> like copper <b>redhorse,</b> whose presence is an indication of the quality of water and aquatic. The data presented in the 1998 report are still used as a reference in 2011.|$|R
5000|$|Because of {{the shallow}} {{depth of the}} river and the {{somewhat}} poor water quality, game fish are not abundant in the Sauk <b>River.</b> <b>Redhorse</b> and sucker are found {{in most parts of the}} river. However, in the [...] "Chain of Lakes" [...] area, fishing is very popular with a variety of fish being caught. Panfish, walleye and northern are the most common to anglers in this area. Walleye and northern can also be found where the river enters the Mississippi.|$|E
50|$|Many {{fish species}} such as brook trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, smallmouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish, crappies, shorthead redhorse, <b>river</b> <b>redhorse,</b> golden redhorse, silver redhorse, greater redhorse, black redhorse, {{northern}} hogsuckers, and white suckers inhabit the river. The Root River system provides habitat {{to a number of}} bird species. Red-tailed hawks and bald eagles {{can be found in the}} area. Blue herons, wild turkeys, and wood ducks are also commonly seen. Numerous mammals can be spotted in the region including deer, gray fox, red fox, coyotes, raccoons, squirrels, and badgers.|$|E

50|$|Shorthead redhorse {{have a wide}} habitat range. They live {{in fresh}} water and are found in streams, lakes and <b>rivers.</b> Shorthead <b>redhorse</b> can {{tolerate}} clear to cloudy water and likes loose substrate like gravel and sand. These fish are benthic feeders that like to feed in riffles and rifle margins. During a study done in Illinois by Sule et al., they found that “shorthead redhorse consumed items from approximately 60 food categories, primarily invertebrate taxa”. Twenty-four to sixty-eight percent of their diet was unidentified when stomach contents were analyzed. Also found, 21-50% of the unidentified matter, or 13% of their total diet, was organic matter. Shorthead redhorse eat the most insects {{out of all the}} fish in the sucker family. They can also eat microcrustacea and plant matter. Predators of shorthead redhorse vary depending on size. Juveniles can be eaten by northern pike, walleyes, and smallmouth bass. Adult or larger shorthead redhorse are eaten by northern pike and muskellunge. The shorthead redhorse does not actively compete for food. Because of their wide range of prey and eating the most vertebrates of all the suckers, {{they do not have a}} competitor. Humans impact shorthead redhorse habitat. The construction of dams blocked free flowing rivers like the Mississippi in which they live, disrupting their spawning migration routes. Shorthead redhorse are killed easily by pollutants in the water. “The upstream migratory range of shorthead redhorse in a Maryland river decreased due to an increase in chlorinated sewage outfalls”. Factory pollutants are dumped into streams or rivers and will settle onto the bottom. Because such a large portion of the shorthead redhorse’s diet is sediment, it ingests high concentrations of the chemicals and can die.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —Relative weight (Wr) is one {{of several}} con-dition indices used to assess the general health of fishes. Standard weight (Ws) {{equations}} are required to calculate Wr, but are unavailable for many nongame and riverine fish species. Therefore, we developed Ws equations for the following taxa: longnose gar Lepisosteus osseus, spotted gar L. oculatus, common carp Cyprinus carpio, bigmouth buffalo Ictiobus cyprinellus, river carpsucker Carpiodes carpio, shorthead redhorse Moxostoma ma-crolepidotum, smallmouth buffalo I. bubalus, white sucker Catostomus commersoni, black bullhead Ameiu-rus melas, brown bullhead A. nebulosus, flathead catfish Pylodictis olivaris, white catfish A. catus, yellow bull-head A. natalis, white perch Morone americana, yellow bass M. mississippiensis, green sunfish Lepomis cyanel-lus, rock bass Ambloplites rupestris, and warmouth L. gulosus. These Ws equations were evaluated with statis-tical validation approaches similar to previously defined regression-line-percentile equations. Standard length categories were developed or revised for 10 of these 18 species (longnose gar, spotted gar, bigmouth buffalo, <b>river</b> carpsucker, shorthead <b>redhorse,</b> smallmouth buf-falo, white sucker, brown bullhead, white catfish, and yellow bullhead) to allow for comparison of mean Wr values within and among length categories instead of assessing only population mean Wr...|$|R
50|$|Due to {{its narrow}} range of habitat preferences, {{spawning}} requirements and intolerance of high turbidity, siltation and pollution, the <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> is susceptible {{to a number of}} threats. Hydroelectric development and flood control dams cause habitat fragmentation and alter habitat conditions, resulting in restricted movements of individual fish and limited gene flow between populations. Also, changes in flow regime and siltation of spawning habitats may reduce recruitment. Agricultural and municipal activities that affect water quality (increased sediment load, excessive nutrients) also adversely impact this species. Because of its sensitivity, it is used as an indicator species to gauge stream health.|$|E
50|$|The <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> occurs {{throughout}} {{the central and}} eastern Mississippi River System and the Gulf Slope from Florida to Louisiana. In Canada, its distribution is characterized by disjunct populations in southern Ontario and Quebec. This species has declined considerably over much of its range in the last 200 years. Populations still occur in the Grand, Trent, Thames, Mississippi, Gatineau and Richelieu rivers, and recent data suggest a wider distribution in the Ottawa River than previously documented. However, this fish appears to no longer exist in the Châteauguay and Yamaska watersheds and has declined dramatically in the St. Lawrence River.|$|E
50|$|The Richelieu River {{is home to}} {{more than}} fifty species of fish. Many of them are {{considered}} threatened or endangered as copper redhorse, <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> and sturgeon. One of the last spawning of copper redhorse (Moxostoma hubbsi), a species endemic in Quebec is also found in the river. Other species, such as goby, are exogenous. In fact, they come from an external medium and were accidentally introduced into the ecosystem, often water discharge ballast vessels that ply the St. Lawrence River. Considered harmful or invasive, they colonize the water, funds and compete with native species (local) and a threat to the integrity of the ecosystem river.|$|E
5000|$|The Salt River, {{also known}} as the Big Salt River, is a 19.3 mi river that rises in northeastern Isabella County. The main branch is formed by the {{confluence}} of the North and South branches in Denver Township at [...] near the boundary between Isabella and Midland County. The north branch is formed less than five miles north and west of this point by the confluence of several drains, including Killenbeck, Sharps, McDonald, Lamphere, and Loomis. The river has abundant <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> and common carp populations, especially by the Geneva Road bridge. The South Branch is fed by Jordan Creek, Lewis Drain, and Spring Creek. The main branch flows mostly eastward into the Tittabawassee River in Sanford at [...]|$|E
50|$|Historically, the shorthead redhorse is {{native to}} North America. Its native range {{includes}} the Great Lakes, Hudson Bay, Mississippi River, and Saint Lawrence River basins. They ranged across from Quebec to Alberta and {{as far south as}} northern Alabama and Oklahoma. Shorthead redhorse also originally occupied the Atlantic Slope drainages, ranging from the Hudson River in New York to the Santee River in South Carolina. When the Tennessee Valley Authority started building dams in the 1930s in an attempt to create power, the dams blocked different fish such as striped bass, from moving upstream to their spawning ranges. While some fish ranges have decreased since the construction of the dams, the shorthead redhorse’s range has expanded. The shorthead redhorse is a “habitat generalist near the core of its range,” so it can tolerate disturbance better than other related redhorse species such as the <b>river</b> <b>redhorse,</b> M. carinatum. Shorthead redhorse can now be found in the tidal zones of the Hudson River. They are believed to have invaded the Hudson by way of the Mohawk River and have established themselves in the Hudson estuary. Other areas they have been found in include the Embarras River system in Illinois and the Red River below Lake Texoma dam in Grayson County, Texas.|$|E
40|$|Fishways {{have been}} {{constructed}} to maintain longitudinal connectivity for fish in fluvial systems impacted by barriers but there are relatively few studies of their biological effectiveness. Trend analysis of the CanFishPass fishway database showed that only 9 % of Canadian fishways have been studied using methods that enable proper evaluation of biological effectiveness. A biological evaluation of the Vianney-Legendre fishway in Quebec for the passage of three redhorse species (Moxostoma anisurum, M. carinatum, M. macrolepidotum; silver, river and shorthead redhorse respectively) showed attraction efficiencies of 51 %, 12 %, 50 %, respectively, and passage efficiencies of 88 %, 50 % and 69 % respectively. For all species, failures in the fishway were likely to occur beforethe second turning basin in the fishway (84 % of failures). Shorthead redhorse had higher maximum metabolic rates and were faster swimmers than silver and <b>river</b> <b>redhorse.</b> <b>River</b> <b>redhorse</b> recovered their lactate and glucose concentrations more quickly than silver and shorthead redhorse, and <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> were second in terms of metabolic recovery and swim speed. Fish sampled {{from the top of}} the fishway had nearly identical lactate, glucose and pH values compared to control fish. Additional research is required to understand how organismal performance, environmental conditions, and other factors interact with fishway designs to dictate which fish are successful and to inform research of future fishways. Our research suggests that there may be an opportunity for a rapid assessment approach where manual chasing and sampling of fish {{from the top of the}} fishway are used to determine which species (or sizes of fish) are exceeding their physiological capacity during passage...|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of biological design criteria to facilitate fishway passage design is limited, partially {{due to the}} lack of {{understanding of}} biological motivators, cues and constraints, as well as a lack of biological performance evaluations of structures once they are built. The Vianney-Legendre vertical slot fishway on the Richelieu River, Quebec, passes large numbers of migrating redhorse (Moxostoma spp.) upriver to spawning grounds each year. We evaluated the physiological capacity and relative swimming ability of three redhorse species (M. anisurum, M. carinatum, M. macrolepidotum, silver, river and shorthead redhorse respectively) to determine how these biotic factors relate to variation in fishway passage success and duration. Shorthead redhorse had higher maximum metabolic rates and were faster swimmers than silver and <b>river</b> <b>redhorse.</b> <b>River</b> <b>redhorse</b> recovered their lactate and glucose concentrations more quickly than silver and shorthead redhorse, and <b>river</b> <b>redhorse</b> were second in terms of metabolic recovery and swim speed. Additionally, fish sampled from the top of the fishway had nearly identical lactate, glucose and pH values compared to control fish. Using passive integrated transponders in 2010 and 2012 we observed that passage success and duration was highly variable among redhorse species and was not consistent among years suggesting that other factors such as water temperature, timing of the study and river flows modulate passage success. Clearly additional research is needed to understand how organismal performance, environmental conditions, and other factors (including abundance of conspecifics and other co-migrants) interact with fishway design features to dictate which fish will be successful and to inform design of future fishways. Our research suggests that there may be an opportunity for a rapid assessment approach where manual chasing and sampling of fish from the top of the fishway are used to determine which species (or sizes of fish) are exceeding their physiological capacity during passage.

40|$|This study {{provides}} baseline {{data on the}} <b>River</b> <b>Redhorse</b> (Moxostoma carinatum; Moxostomatini: Catostomidae) in Canada. Sampling focussed on the Mississippi and Gatineau Rivers, in the National Capital Region, in 1998 and 1999. Spawning occurred in rocky, shallow (< 2 m) fast-water sections in May and June {{when the temperature reached}} 17 °C. In the Mississippi River, post-spawn specimens were captured on a variety of substrates in deeper waters. Both opercular bones and scales (n = 19) recorded accurate age until age XII after which only the opercular bone provided clear annuli. Growth for both sexes was defined by the following equation: total length at age (mm) = 0. 0905 (age) 3 - 5. 1452 (age) 2 + 95. 94 (age) + 0. 367. Population sizes were assessed through capture-recapture methods. The population size in the Mississippi River was estimated at 622 (+/- 6. 3 s. d.). The spawning population of the Gatineau River was estimated at 1216 (+/- 915 s. d.). It is suggested that the species remains a species of "special concern" in Canada...|$|E
