40|$|Seamless {{garments}} {{are popular}} knitted products nowadays. They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) core-spun yarn is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA core-spun yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA core-spun yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic <b>recovery</b> <b>property.</b> The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA core-spun yarn as the base yarn and PA fiber as the face yarn for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic <b>recovery</b> <b>property</b> and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA core-spun yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

40|$|Conventional pattern {{construction}} and pattern making methods typically require the size measurements {{of a range}} of standard mannequins or human bodies in order to construct the varying pattern blocks for garment design. These various methods and skills, in the fashion industry, factory or studio are performed by pattern makers or producers, and are refined through the garment sampling and wearer trial system (an uneconomical trial and error) used on woven garments or on woven stretch garments to produce varying garment designs. This is particularly true when fabric stretch and <b>recovery</b> <b>properties</b> and values are encountered. There is a strong alliance with the heuristic knowledge. The aim of the present work is to investigate the influence of woven stretch fabric properties on pattern construction. The stretch and <b>recovery</b> <b>properties</b> of woven stretch fabrics will be taken account for pattern reduction and alteration {{for the development of a}} suitable garment pattern to fit the body shape and to meet the comfort requirement during the body movement. The relationship between the degree of alteration and reduction and the relevant fabric stretch properties is to be established. In this thesis, the stretch and <b>recovery</b> <b>properties</b> of various woven stretch fabrics have been measured. The conventional pattern is reduced and altered based on the comfort requirement for body movement, fit to body shape and the extension and <b>recovery</b> <b>properties</b> of the woven stretch fabric. Wearer trial test of the altered garment pattern of woven stretch fabrics is carried out for subjective and objective evaluation in the reference of the traditional woven garment pattern. Their comfort and garment appearances are evaluated by a panel of judges and the wearer. The size and shape stability of garments after the wearing tests are assessed. The results demonstrated that the new pattern method was significantly better for woven stretch fabric.

Alterations in <b>recovery</b> <b>properties</b> were induced thermally because size and severity of the affected area could be controlled on the basis of physical principles which were modeled. We recorded unipolar electrograms from 75 cardiac surface sites simultaneously during stimulation of atria and pulmonary conus in control periods and in the presence of warmed areas of varying sizes and intensities. Size of the areas was controlled by the diameter of an aperture through which a light source was directed. Intensity was controlled by the light source excitation voltage. Myocardial temperature was monitored with a thermistor. The QRS, STT, and QRST deflection areas were determined by computer processing and displayed as isoarea maps. Difference maps also were determined by subtracting control QRST isoarea maps from those obtained in the presence of warmed areas. QRST area difference maps were related closely to the size and severity of the thermally induced changes in <b>recovery</b> <b>properties.</b> With areas of the same size and increasing myocardial temperatures, the magnitude of the change in QRST area increased, and the gradient of contour lines between the affected and unaffected areas increased.

The proposed matrix is constructed in the systematic form [A I], where A is a randomly generated submatrix with elements distributed according to i. i. d. Gaussian, and I is the identity matrix. In the noiseless setting, this systematic construction retains similar property as the conventional Gaussian ensemble achieves. However, in the noisy setting with gross errors of arbitrary magnitude, where Gaussian ensemble fails catastrophically, systematic construction displays strong stability. In this paper, we prove its stable reconstruction property. We further show its ℓ 1 -norm sparsity <b>recovery</b> <b>property</b> by proving its restricted isometry property (RIP).

A composite finite-time controller (CFTC) is proposed with a three-stage design procedure.

Then, by using homogeneous system theory, a continuous finite-time disturbance observer (CFTDO) is constructed to estimate the disturbance generated by an exogenous system. Finally, a composite controller which consists of a feedforward compensation part based on CFTDO and the obtained FTC law is proposed.
