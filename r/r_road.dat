25|$|This one-off Pagani Zonda was {{the very}} last 760 edition of the Zonda made in 2016. The bespoke {{supercar}} {{is based on the}} 760 RS model and specially built for one of the big Pagani collectors. Unlike other special edition Zondas, this unique 760 has a unique design rear spoiler and was engineered by one of the world GT champions to generate the maximum downforce to give the ultimate grip on the circuit. The car was tested by the Toyota factory driver and GT500 champion Akira Iida on Fuji Speedway during the Pagani Raduno in Japan this year. Mr Iida commented the Zonda Oliver Evolution is the best handling and closest to the Zonda Evolution <b>R</b> <b>road</b> car he has ever driven.|$|E
500|$|By mid-December 1861 Sherman had {{recovered}} sufficiently {{to return to}} service under Halleck in the Department of the Missouri. (In March, Halleck's command was redesignated the Department of the Mississippi and enlarged to unify command in the West). Sherman's initial assignments were rear-echelon commands, first of an instructional barracks near St. Louis and then {{in command of the}} District of Cairo. [...] Operating from Paducah, Kentucky, he provided logistical support for the operations of Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to capture Fort Donelson (February 1862). [...] Grant, the previous commander of the District of Cairo, had recently won a major victory at Fort Henry (February 6, 1862) and been given command of the ill-defined District of West Tennessee. [...] Although Sherman was technically the senior officer at this time, he wrote to Grant, [...] "I feel anxious about you as I know the great facilities [...] have of concentration by means of the River and <b>R</b> <b>Road,</b> but [...] have faith in you—Command me in any way." ...|$|E

2500|$|R. Stephenson and Company built a {{locomotive}} steam engine for the Camden and Amboy that {{was completed in}} July 1831 and shipped to Philadelphia from Liverpool on the 14th of the same month. It was received by [...] "Edwin A. Stephens for the Camden and South Amboy <b>R.</b> <b>Road</b> & Trans Co." [...] The locomotive engine was named John Bull in reference to its place of manufacture. As of 1986, it was the oldest operable locomotive engine. The John Bull arrived at Bordentown on September 4, 1831 and was first tested November 12. The first section, from Stewarts Point Wharf near Bordentown north to Hightstown, was {{opened to the public}} on October 1, 1832, being operated by horse at first.|$|E
2500|$|Little Richard's saxophone-studded, mid-1950s <b>R</b> <b>road</b> {{band was}} {{credited}} by James Brown {{and others as}} being the first to put the funk in the rock'n'roll beat. Following his temporary exit from secular music to become an evangelist in 1957, some of Little Richard's band members joined Brown and the Famous Flames, beginning {{a long string of}} hits for them in 1958. By the mid-1960s, James Brown had developed his signature groove that emphasized the downbeat—with heavy emphasis on the first beat of every measure to etch his distinctive sound, rather than the backbeat that typified African American music. Brown often cued his band with the command [...] "On the one!," [...] changing the percussion emphasis/accent from the one-two-three-four backbeat of traditional soul music to the one-two-three-four downbeat – but with an even-note syncopated guitar rhythm (on quarter notes two and four) featuring a hard-driving, repetitive brassy swing. This one-three beat launched the shift in Brown's signature music style, starting with his 1964 hit single, [...] "Out of Sight" [...] and his 1965 hits, [...] "Papa's Got a Brand New Bag" [...] and [...] "I Got You (I Feel Good)".|$|E
