5|$|<b>Routine</b> <b>care</b> {{during the}} growing season {{involves}} keeping the rows free of competing weeds, especially when the plants are young. The plants are shallow-rooted and do not need a great deal of water when established. Bulbing usually takes place after 12 to 18 weeks. The bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be kept in storage, they should be harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. In dry weather, they can be left {{on the surface of the}} soil for a few days to dry out properly, then they can be placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. They should be stored in a well-ventilated, cool place such as a shed.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{home care}} {{is the most}} common level of care provided. In spite of its title, routine home care does not {{indicate}} a location of care, but a level (or intensity) of care provided. <b>Routine</b> <b>care</b> may be provided at a nursing home or assisted living facility, although the majority of hospice patients are treated at home. Interdisciplinary team members supply a variety of services during routine home care, including offering necessary supplies, such as durable medical equipment, medications related to the hospice diagnosis and incidentals like diapers, bed pads, gloves, and skin protectants. Twenty-four-hour on-call services must be available as needed. Typically this is provided after normal business hours by a registered nurse prepared to address urgent patient concerns.|$|E

In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and <b>routine</b> <b>care</b> is that the hospice pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient hospice unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the hospice unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E

5|$|The life {{expectancy}} of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; and, if kept trim and fit, a Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop {{as a result of}} lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With <b>routine</b> <b>care,</b> these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.|$|E

2500|$|Anal or {{genital warts}} may be {{transmitted}} during birth. The presence of wart-like lesions on the genitals {{of young children}} has been suggested {{as an indicator of}} sexual abuse. However, genital warts can sometimes result from autoinoculated by warts elsewhere on the body, such as from the hands. [...] It has also been reported from sharing of swimsuits, underwear, or bath towels, and from non-sexual touching during <b>routine</b> <b>care</b> such as diapering. Genital warts in children {{are less likely to be}} caused by HPV subtypes 6 and 11 than adults, and more likely to be caused by HPV types that cause warts elsewhere on the body ("cutaneous types"). Surveys of pediatricians who are child abuse specialists suggest that in children younger than 4 years old, there is no consensus on whether the appearance of new anal or genital warts, by itself, can be considered an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to the Summerfield opinion piece, Irwin Mansdorf, a member of Task Force on Medical and Public Health Issues, Scholars for Peace in the Middle East wrote an opinion piece about <b>routine</b> <b>care</b> that Palestinians continue to receive in Israeli hospitals and from Israeli physicians, saying that [...] "Palestinians receive care in Israel {{that they could not}} receive in any neighboring Arab country. In the last few months alone nearly 200 Palestinian children who were referred under a joint Israeli-Palestinian programme to treat children with serious medical conditions have already undergone major surgery at Israeli hospitals at no cost to the families. Another 350–400 Palestinian children have undergone free diagnostic testing." [...] Simon M Fellerman also wrote one noting that Saving Children, established by the Peres Center for Peace, enables hundreds of Palestinian children to receive free medical care, in particular cardiac surgery, from Israeli surgeons. In {{response to}} the Lancet report, an Israeli government spokesperson said that Palestinians in the territories could receive medical care in Israel itself, noting that 28,000 Palestinians from Gaza had been treated in Israel during the two years covered by the Lancet report.|$|E

Trial arm, occupational therapyled lifestyle treatment comprising lifestyle review of fluid intake, diet pattern, exercise, caffeine, alcohol and nicotine. Primary outcome measure: beck anxiety inventory. At baseline, participants attended 2 - 3 times more GP appointments than population average, reducing at 10 months to 1. 6 times population average for <b>routine</b> GP <b>care</b> and 0. 97 population average for lifestyle arm. At 10 months, 33 % fewer referrals (6 referrals; 0 mental health) than at baseline (9 referrals; 2 mental health) were made for lifestyle arm patients compared with 42 % increase (from 12 referrals; 8 mental health at baseline to 17 referrals; 7 mental health) in GP care arm. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors were prescribed most often. Benzodiazepines and beta-blockers were prescribed more often than tricyclic against current clinical guidelines. In conclusion, we found that PD patients at baseline were high healthcare resource users.

40|$|IntroductionHealth care {{access and}} sociodemographic {{characteristics}} may influence chronic disease management even among {{adults who have}} health insurance. The objective {{of this study was}} to examine awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, by health care access and sociodemographic characteristics, among insured adults in New York City. MethodsUsing data from the 2004 New York City Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, we investigated inequalities in the diagnosis and management of hypertension and hypercholesterolemia among insured adults aged 20 to 64 years (n = 1, 334). We assessed differences in insurance type (public, private) and <b>routine</b> place of <b>care</b> (yes, no), by sociodemographic characteristics. ResultsOne in 10 participants with hypertension and 3 in 10 with hypercholesterolemia were unaware and untreated. Having a <b>routine</b> place of <b>care</b> was associated with treatment and control of hypertension and with awareness, treatment, and control of hypercholesterolemia, after adjusting for insurance type, age, sex, race/ethnicity, foreign birth, income, and education. Differences in systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol between people with versus without a <b>routine</b> place of <b>care</b> were 2 to 3 times the difference found between people with public versus private insurance. Few differences were associated with sociodemographic characteristics after adjusting for <b>routine</b> place of <b>care</b> and insurance type; however, male sex, younger age, Asian race, and foreign birth with short-term US residence reduced the odds of having a <b>routine</b> place of <b>care.</b> Neither income nor education predicted having a <b>routine</b> place of <b>care.</b> ConclusionSociodemographic characteristics may influence chronic disease management among the insured through health care access factors such as having a <b>routine</b> place of <b>care...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background There is {{an urgent}} need for the {{development}} of cost-effective preventive strategies to reduce the onset of mental disorders. Aims To establish the cost-effectiveness of a stepped care preventive intervention for depression and anxiety disorders in older people at high risk of these conditions, compared with <b>routine</b> primary <b>care.</b> Method An economic evaluation was conducted alongside a pragmatic randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN 26474556). Consenting individuals presenting with subthreshold levels of depressive or anxiety symptoms were randomly assigned to a preventive stepped care programme (n = 86) or to <b>routine</b> primary <b>care</b> (n = 84). Results The intervention was successful in halving the incidence rate of depression and anxiety at 563 (£ 412) per recipient and 4367 (£ 3196) per disorder-free year gained, compared with <b>routine</b> primary <b>care.</b> The latter would represent good value for money if the willingness to pay for a disorder-free year is at least 5000.
