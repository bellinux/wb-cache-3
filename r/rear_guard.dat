5|$|Mortier {{accepted}} the bait of a rumored Russian retreat. In {{the early morning}} of 11 November he and Gazan departed from Dürenstein to seize Stein and Krems, presuming the Russians had either abandoned the settlements or left only a small rear-guard behind. As they approached Stein, a column of Miloradovich's troops attacked the French forward positions. Thinking this force was the rumored Russian <b>rear</b> <b>guard,</b> Mortier ordered Gen. Gazan to counterattack and push east towards the town of Stein. Fighting spread though the villages of Oberloiben, Unterloiben and the farm at Rothenhof. Instead of withdrawing, as a <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> would, more and more Russian troops appeared and engaged the French column.|$|E
5|$|A {{northern}} {{route of}} retreat {{had too many}} obstacles, so Hunter's force retreated westward toward Charleston—with the Confederate army in pursuit. On June 19, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry was the <b>rear</b> <b>guard.</b> The regiment often had to fight dismounted. Averell's entire division fought for two hours near Liberty. His cavalry division fought until its ammunition was exhausted, and then was relieved by Crook's infantry. Averell lost 122 men.|$|E
5|$|After the {{successful}} retreat across the Dan River, during which Williams led his men during many highly successful <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> actions checking the enemy's advance and baffling every British {{attempt to bring}} the American army into a general engagement, General Nathanael Greene chose to offer battle to General Cornwallis's forces on March 15, 1781 on ground of his own choosing at Guilford Court House, inside the city limits of present-day Greensboro, North Carolina.|$|E

However, while the clerk promotes as usual upon capturing a commanding piece, it cannot promote by entering or moving within the promotion zone unless the advance and <b>rear</b> <b>guards</b> have already entered the zone.|$|R
60|$|The delays caused {{at every}} village {{rendered}} the work slow, {{as well as}} arduous. The French drove the light division through Coimbra and, following, pressed so hotly {{that a number of}} minor combats took place between their cavalry and the British <b>rear</b> <b>guards.</b> Before Leiria the <b>rear</b> <b>guards</b> had to fight strongly, to enable the guns to quit the town before the French entered it.|$|R

5|$|During their {{retreat from}} Quebec, the Americans {{carefully}} took or destroyed all ships on Lake Champlain that might prove {{useful to the}} British. When Arnold and his troops, making up the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> of the army, abandoned Fort Saint-Jean, they burned or sank all the boats they could not use, and {{set fire to the}} sawmill and the fort. These actions effectively denied the British any hope of immediately moving onto the lake.|$|E
5|$|Lafayette evaded Cornwallis' {{attempts}} to capture him in Richmond. In June 1781, Cornwallis received orders from London {{to proceed to}} the Chesapeake Bay and to oversee construction of a port, in preparation for an overland attack on Philadelphia. As the British column traveled, Lafayette sent small squads that would appear unexpectedly, attacking the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> or foraging parties, and giving the impression that his forces were larger than they were.|$|E
5|$|Light {{infantry}} were equipped more lightly {{than regular}} line regiments, and marched at 140 paces per minute. Tasks {{of the light}} infantry included advance and <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> action, flanking protection for armies and forward skirmishing. They were also called upon to take regular line formations during battles, or to act as part of fortification storming parties. During the Peninsular War they were regarded as the army's elite corps.|$|E

Lee from the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. In this capacity, Monroe successfully protected the -long wagon train. Monroe fought for the Confederate Army throughout the duration of the war, until 1865. Following the war, he was paroled by Union authorities.|$|E
5|$|The 22nd {{spent the}} next day, December 15, {{in the city of}} Fredericksburg, hearing rumors that Burnside {{intended}} to personally lead another assault on the heights. But no attack materialized, night came, and the V Corps crossed the pontoon bridges back to Falmouth, with the 22nd acting as <b>rear</b> <b>guard.</b> During the battle of Frederickburg, the 22nd lost 12 killed and 42 wounded, roughly 28 percent casualties.|$|E

5|$|The {{unit was}} among the first to occupy the {{territory}} of a Confederate state when it captured Alexandria, Virginia on May 24, 1861, less than 24hours after the Commonwealth seceded from the Union. The regiment suffered extensive casualties during the First Battle of Bull Run during the fighting on Henry House Hill and while serving as the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> for the retreating Union Army.|$|E
5|$|At dawn on August 11, one 300-man {{battalion}} of the 766th Regiment entered {{the village of}} P'ohang, creating a state of alarm among its populace. The village was only protected by a small force of South Korean Navy, Air Force and Army personnel comprising the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> of the ROK 3rd Division. The South Korean forces engaged the 766th forces around the village's middle school with small-arms fire until noon. At that point, North Korean armored vehicles moved in to reinforce the 766th troops and drove the South Koreans out of the village.|$|E
5|$|Between July 1926 and March 1927 Peng campaigned in Hunan, {{participating}} in the capture of Changsha and Wuhan. Under general Ho Chien(何键), Peng participated in the Battle of Fengtai, in which Kuomintang forces decisively defeated the warlord Wu Peifu. In 1927, Wang Jingwei attempted to establish a left-leaning Kuomintang government in Wuhan that threatened Chiang Kai-shek's leadership. Tang Shengzhi, who Peng served under, aligned himself with Wang, and Peng was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and regimental commander. After Tang's forces were decisively defeated by Chiang, Peng commanded the <b>rear</b> <b>guard,</b> protecting the retreat of Tang's forces back into Hunan.|$|E
50|$|Although all {{divisions}} of the U.S. VI Corps achieved clear breakthroughs during 23 March, they came in contact only with <b>rear</b> <b>guards</b> and failed to affect the German evacuation materially. Because a German force in Speyer fought doggedly, contact between the 12th and 14th Armored Divisions was delayed. Both armored divisions early on 24 March sent task forces in quest of the lone remaining Rhine bridge, the one at Germersheim, but neither had reached {{the fringes of the}} town when at 10:20 the Germans blew up the prize. Formal German evacuation of the west bank ended during the night of the 24th, while American units continued to mop up <b>rear</b> <b>guards</b> and stragglers through the 25th.|$|R
50|$|During his {{military}} service Burnham prepared several articles for professional journals, including: Military Training of the Regular Army (1889); Three Roads to a Commission (1893); Duties of Outposts, Advance and <b>Rear</b> <b>Guards</b> (1893); Regulations of St. John’s Military School (1894); and Historical Sketch, Twentieth United States Infantry (1902).|$|R
50|$|Despite a great superiority in numbers, the {{offensive}} {{was by no}} means easy. German opposition was ferocious and the fighting raged for every town and city. The Wehrmacht made extensive use of <b>rear</b> <b>guards,</b> leaving some troops in each city and on each hill, slowing down the Soviet offensive.|$|R
5|$|Both battalions {{were still}} {{in contact with the}} Germans during the {{withdrawal}} with 10 Para to the north having the furthest to travel to reach the relative safety of the rail crossing. By 15:00 it became obvious that the Germans were already in front of the battalion. Now, as well as fighting a rearguard action, they had to capture positions between themselves and the railway line. Captain Lionel Queripel of 10 Para was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross, the highest British military decoration, for his actions while in command of the battalion's <b>rear</b> <b>guard.</b>|$|E
5|$|Colonel William E. Peters {{was able}} to get his 21st Virginia Cavalry Regiment ready for the {{oncoming}} Union cavalry, but was driven back across the river. Earlier, Peters had refused to burn Chambersburg and General McCausland had him arrested. However, the arrest was revoked a short time later, and Peters led the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> when they left the burning town. He performed relatively well at Moorefield, leading portions of his regiment while they slowed the Federal advance {{on the south side of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|Controversy {{surrounds}} the breakout {{before the last}} stand—which various writers have posited might have actually been desertion—and a box of gold sovereigns, which a Matabele inDuna (leader) later claimed {{had been given to}} two unidentified men from Forbes's <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> on 2 December, along with a message that Lobengula admitted defeat and wanted the column to stop pursuing him. Two batmen were initially found guilty of accepting the gold, keeping it for themselves and not passing on the message, but the evidence against them was inconclusive and largely circumstantial; the convictions were ultimately overturned.|$|E

5|$|General Crook finally {{understood}} {{the situation as}} his infantry and cavalry fled north through Winchester. He organized a more orderly retreat. Powell's brigade and an infantry brigade led by Colonel Rutherford B. Hayes (future President of the United States) were among the few organized units remaining. They became the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> against the pursuing Confederate cavalry. At one point, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry made a charge with sabers drawn—rescuing a portion of Hayes' brigade that became {{cut off from the}} rest of the command.|$|E
5|$|Lack of bridges did not {{slow the}} Coalition pursuit. The Austrians {{repaired}} the bridges by Matterdingen, {{and moved on}} Moreau at Freiburg. On 20 October, Moreau's army of 20,000 united south of Freiburg im Breisgau with Ferino's column. Ferino's force was smaller than Moreau had hoped, bringing the total of the combined French force to about 32,000. Charles' combined forces of 24,000 closely followed Moreau's <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> from Freiburg, southwest, to a line of hills stretching between Kandern and the river.|$|E
5|$|Lariboisière's {{direction}} of artillery {{fire at the}} Battle of Austerlitz resulted {{in the destruction of}} the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated. His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in fire on the Russian lines. Lariboisière's artillery also provided the <b>rear</b> <b>guard</b> coverage of the French withdrawal from Beresina. One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris.|$|E

Johnson's party was taken by surprise and almost taken prisoner before fleeing.|$|R
25|$|For {{the latter}} part of the war, {{although}} the Cossacks did prove especially useful in reconnaissance and <b>rear</b> <b>guards,</b> the war did show that the age of horse cavalry had come to an end. The famous IVth Guards Kuban Cossack Regiment which took part in heavy fighting in the course of the liberation of Southern Ukraine and Romania was allowed to proudly march on the Red Square in the famous Victory parade of 1945.|$|R
