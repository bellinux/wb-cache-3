50|$|Loin pain-hematuria {{syndrome}} (LPHS) is {{a poorly}} defined disorder characterized by recurrent or persistent loin (flank) pain and hematuria {{that appears to}} represent glomerular bleeding. Most patients present with both manifestations, but some present with loin pain or hematuria alone. Pain episodes are rarely associated with low-grade fever and dysuria, but urinary tract infection is not present. The major causes of flank pain and hematuria, such as nephrolithiasis and blood clot, are typically not present. <b>Renal</b> <b>arteriography</b> may suggest focally impaired cortical perfusion, while renal biopsy may show interstitial fibrosis and arterial sclerosis.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjective: to {{investigate}} the incidence and risk factors for renal function deterioration after renal angiography and angioplasty or stenting. Methods: a retrospective study of 85 consecutive patients undergoing selective <b>renal</b> artery <b>arteriography</b> (n= 53) or renal artery angioplasty % (PTRA) stenting (n= 32) for renal artery stenosis. Multivariate logistic regression {{analysis was used to}} determine independent predictors of deterioration of renal function, defined as an increase of serum creatinine by at least one third within 24 h. Results: deterioration of renal function occurred in 13 patients (15 %), [8 / 53 (15 %) after angiography and 5 / 32 (16 %) after PTRA/stenting]. Only pre-existing renal impairment (se-creatinine≥ 177 μmol/l) (Odds ratio: 40; 95 % confidence interval 1. 2 – 72, p= 0. 02) and administered dosage of contrast agent (more than 225 ml) (OR 67; 95 % CI 1 1. 8 – 100, p= 0. 02) were independently associated with renal function deterioration. Conclusion: transient renal dysfunction after renal artery angiography or PTRA/stenting occurs in about 15 % of patients, but persistent renal failure is uncommon. Pre-existing renal impairment and amount of contrast agent are independent risk factors. Endovascular treatment of renal artery stenosis is not associated with a higher risk of renal deterioration compared to selective renal angiography...|$|R
40|$|Background: Gadolinium {{contrast}} media (Gd-CM) {{are regarded as}} non-nephrotoxic or considerably less nephrotoxic than iodine {{contrast media}} (I-CM), and have therefore come {{to be used as}} a substitute for I-CM in patients with renal insufficiency in a variety of radiographic examinations. Purpose: To investigate renal histomorphological changes caused by Gd-CM in comparison with I-CM after <b>renal</b> X-ray <b>arteriography</b> in an ischemic porcine model, and to evaluate these changes in relation to the nephrotoxicity of the CM used. Material and Methods: Test solutions: gadopentetate, gadodiamide, iohexol, gadobutrol, iopromide, iodixanol, mannitol, and saline. The experiments were performed on 152 animals. Each pig was randomized to receive one test solution injected into the balloon-occluded (10 min) right renal artery. The kidneys were evaluated histomorphologically. The severity of histomorphological changes was graded subjectively: 1 = minimal, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = marked. Results: The main histological changes were 1) proximal tubular and glomerular necrosis, 2) hemorrhage/congestion of the cortex, medulla, and glomeruli, 3) proximal tubular vacuolation, and 4) protein-filled tubules in the cortex and medulla. Necrosis and hemorrhage/congestion were more frequent after injections with gadopentetate, mannitol solution iso-osmotic to gadopentetate, and gadobutrol compared to all other groups (P< 0. 001). The degree of necrosis and hemorrhage/congestion was related to the degree of impairment of renal function, but inversely related to vacuolation and tubular protein filling. Conclusion: In ischemic porcine kidneys, the histomorphological changes caused by Gd-CM are similar to those caused by I-CM. Vacuolation appears to be independent of the osmolality and viscosity of the CM, and does not seem to be an indicator of renal impairment. “High-osmolal” Gd-CM are more nephrotoxic than “low- and iso-osmolal” I-CM when compared in equal volumes of concentrations, resulting in equal X-ray attenuation...|$|R
40|$|Role of duplex {{scanning}} for {{the detection}} of atherosclerotic renal artery disease. To assess the accuracy of renal artery duplex scanning for the purpose of diagnosing atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, we compared the findings of renal arteriograms to the results of duplex scanning in 41 patients. Using an increase of renal artery peak systolic flow velocity of greater than 180 cm/sec, duplex scanning was able to discriminate normal from diseased renal arteries with a sensitivity of 95 % and a specificity of 90 %. Using the principle that blood flow velocity across a stenosis is roughly proportional to the degree of stenosis, it appeared that a ratio of the peak velocity in the renal artery to the aorta (RAR) of greater 3. 5 predicted a greater than 60 % diameter reduction of that renal artery, which is felt to be a significant stenosis Forty-eight vessels were classified as having a greater than 60 % diameter reduction by arteriography. Using the RAR of greater than 3. 5, duplex scanning agreed in 44 renal arteries (sensitivity 92 %). In the 26 <b>renal</b> arteries where <b>arteriography</b> showed a less than 60 % diameter reduction, duplex scanning agreed in 16 vessels and correctly detected a focal narrowing in nine of the remaining ten vessels. Ten of 11 occluded renal arteries were correctly identified by duplex scanning. Duplex scanning determined the location of the renal artery lesion with an accuracy of 95 % (kappa 0. 74). Since duplex scanning can accurately demonstrate and locate focal renal artery stenosis, we believe it may become an accurate screening test for renovascular hypertension. A renal artery velocity increase to greater than 180 cm/s is an accurate predictor of renal artery disease, and a RAR of greater than 3. 5 is an accurate predictor of a significant renal artery stenosis...|$|R

On <b>renal</b> <b>arteriography,</b> the striated vascular pattern coinciding with tumor thrombus could be seen on the late arterial to nephrographic phase.

On the venous phase, the renal vein could not be visualized in all 6 cases and reno-capsular, spermatic, adrenal and lumbar veins were visualized in 2. Inferior venacavography was most diagnostic demonstrating filling defect due to tumor thrombus in all 6 cases. In two cases having the inferior vena cava completely obstructed by tumor thrombus, abundant collateral circulation was demonstrated along the lumbar and vertebral veins.

40|$|This report {{defines the}} {{incidence}} of variations in the renal vascular pedicle {{in a group of}} patients with normal renal function as determined by standard laboratory criteria. The study group consisted of 166 patients undergoing <b>renal</b> <b>arteriography</b> as potential renal allograft donors. Ninety-seven patients were male and 69 were female. Ages ranged from 18 - 54 years, median age being 37 years. All patients underwent preliminary screening tests including blood chemistries, creatinine clearance, urinalysis, culture and excretory urography. If these studies were normal, <b>renal</b> <b>arteriography</b> was performed utilizing flush aortogram and, in 20 % of cases, selective <b>renal</b> <b>arteriography.</b> The most common anomaly was the presence of multiple renal arteries supplying the same kidney, occurring in 32 % of cases. Prehilar segmental branching was the second most common variation, occurring in 17 % of patients. Other variations included fetal lobulation (4 %), significant stenosis at origin of the renal artery (2 %), fibromuscular dysplasia (2 %), microaneurysms (0. 5 %), true aneurysms (1 %) and dromedary hump (0. 5 %). Less than one-half of the patients demonstrated the simplest vascular pedicle, namely, single artery and vein bilaterally. The incidence of anatomical variations in the renal vascular pedicle is greater than attributed to normal subjects in previous reports. Anomalies determine the choice of kidney in renal allografting and may disqualify a potential donor, {{even in the face of}} ostensibly normal renal function.
