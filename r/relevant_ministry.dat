50|$|At {{the end of}} each episode, {{starting}} with the second episode of each season, each contestant meets with a panel of four experts and Andrew for an evaluation of his or her performance. After all remaining contestants are interviewed, the judges and Andrew deliberate on which contestant and nominator pair have improved enough to graduate from the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The driver who has graduated is eliminated from the competition and is sent home with his or her license returned to him or her. Typically, the contestants drive off with their nominators in the car that they used to arrive at the Driver Rehabilitation Centre. The experts also reserve the right to not graduate anyone during an episode or to graduate multiple contestants at the same time. The experts may also choose to expel any contestant who does not show any incentive to learn, who they believe should not continue driving, or who can not continue the rehabilitation program often for medical or legal reasons. In this particular instance, certain contestants are eliminated from the competition and their licenses are returned, and they are given a ride home.

5000|$|On 28 October, the Shiv Sena, in Saamna, {{came out}} {{in support of the}} accused, saying the arrests were merely {{political}} in nature. Lending credence to this, party chief Uddhav Thackeray pointed out a potential conflict interest in political rivalry as the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) controlled the <b>relevant</b> <b>ministry.</b> His editorial also condemned an attack by NCP party workers on a Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) office in Nashik following the arrest of the sadhvi. Allegations arose that the sadhvi was framed for the blast. The firebrand leader of the Bhartiya Janshakti Party, Uma Bharti, had expressed shock that the BJP and the broader sangh parivar grouping were [...] "disowning" [...] the sadhvi, who is alleged to be linked with the Hindu Jagaran Manch. As the politicised wrangling developed, the Hindu Mahasabha decided to provide legal aid to the suspects from Pune - Upadhyay and Kulkarni - while the umbrella organisation, Abhinav Bharat, of which the two are members. The national president of the Mahasabha, Himani Savarkar, also based in Pune, confirmed this. This comes following a refusal but the two to hire lawyers when produced before the Nashik court. The broader organisation of Hindutva groups were seen to come together when the BJP supported the Shiv Sena's move of extending legal aid to the suspects. The BJP said there was nothing wrong in using [...] "private funds" [...] for [...] "helping" [...] someone. Party spokesperson Prakash Javadekar said: [...] "We have no objection to Shiv Sena's announcement of extending legal aid to Malegaon blast suspects. For that matter even RSS has promised help. It is not wrong for private funds to be utilised for helping someone. It is everyone's right." [...] He added that the party's stand is the same from day one, no one should be discriminated on the basis of religion, caste or sex. The politicking behind the investigation picked up as the probe spread to Uttar Pradesh. The ATS claimed a [...] "high profile leader" [...] from the area may be involved in financing the attack. To this end, BJP MP from Gorakhpur, Yogi Adityanath, dared the Mumbai ATS to accuse him of being the said leader. The ATS then filed an application in a Mumbai court seeking permission to interrogate the hitherto unnamed person, as well as to obtain the co-operation of the UP government in doing so. The UP ATS, however, denied that its Mumbai counterpart had asked for any assistance in netting the alleged accused. UP CM Mayawati convened a high-level meeting of her government to discuss the matter. As yet there was mere speculation that the leader may be Adityanath, or his close associate and BJP MLA from the same town, Radha Mohan Das Agrawal. BJP leader Venkaiah Naidu then said the Maharashtra ATS should speak publicly about the blasts case only when the investigations were complete. He also accused the Congress, as the blame game continued, in saying that it was Congress that gave rise to Bhindranwale in Punjab and supported ULFA in Assam. On the same day, the BJP parliamentary leader, L. K. Advani, also accused the ATS of acting in a politically motivated and unprofessional manner as he alleged that [...] "It has become clear that the ATS is acting in a motivated and unprofessional manner. After going through her (Thakur) affidavit.I have to express my shock and outrage, which I am sure all Indians will share. In view of the shocking charges made against the ATS by the Sadhvi (sic) {{and the fact that the}} present investigating team has lost all moral authority, I demand a change in the present ATS team and a judicial inquiry be ordered to probe the charges made by Sadhvi Pragya and the manner in which unsubstantiated allegations have been made against army personnel. After going through her affidavit detailing how she was physically and psychologically tortured and abused in obscene languages by her interrogators, I have to express my shock and outrage. I cannot believe that such barbaric treatment has been meted out to a spiritual person, that too, a woman in a country that prides itself on its democracy and rule of law." [...] A Shiv Sena activist then filed a PIL in the Bombay High Court, to see the investigation handed over to the Maharashtra CID, and to see action taken against Anti-Terrorism Squad for [...] "ill treating" [...] sadhvi Thakur and botching the handling of the case. In response to the whole imbroglio, the Indian Agriculture Minister and NCP supremo Sharad Pawar described the BJP as [...] "unpatriotic" [...] when he said that [...] "The police have started investigating...If any political party takes objection, it is unfair and unpatriotic. Why should we interfere in the process of investigations?" ...|$|E
