40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{prevalence}} of measles antibodies was investigated by an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) in students aged 14 {{every year since}} 1996 in a Swiss municipality. This region has wide measles vaccine coverage (first dose < or = 95 %, second dose < or = 65 %) without any reported measles outbreaks since 20 years. In 2003 and 2004, in contrast to previous years, surprisingly many negative results (33 % and 54 %, respectively) were observed. OBJECTIVES: To corroborate the measles antibody values by different methods. STUDY DESIGN: Serum samples from 101 students with known vaccination status were available. Sera with equivocal and negative results obtained by two different EIAs were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> indirect immunofluorescence test (IFT) and plaque neutralisation test (PNT). RESULTS: <b>Retesting</b> <b>by</b> IFT showed a positive result in 17 / 21 sera (81 %) and <b>retesting</b> <b>by</b> PNT indicated that 46 / 49 sera (94 %) were positive; the three sera with negative PNT result were from unvaccinated individuals. Only 3 / 96 vaccinated students showed measles antibodies below the putative protective level of 0. 2 IU/ml after <b>retesting</b> <b>by</b> PNT. CONCLUSIONS: Negative EIA results should {{be interpreted with caution}} in a widely vaccinated population without booster by circulation of wild viruses. <b>Retesting</b> <b>by</b> IFT or PNT is recommended...|$|R

Reemergence was confi rmed <b>by</b> <b>retesting</b> the <b>samples,</b> experimental inoculation, fi ngerprinting analysis, and virus isolation. Overwintering of BTV- 8 and continuous low-level infections are assumed. Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a double-stranded RNA virus {{of the genus}} Orbivirus. BTV is transmitted to its hosts by the bite of Culicoides spp. midges. It causes a noncontagious, arthropod-borne disease of domestic and wild ruminants and camelids (1); disease can be serious, particularly in sheep (2 – 4). BTV had never been reported in any European country north of the Alps until August 2006, when outbreaks of BTV serotype 8 (BTV- 8) were almost simultaneously discovered in the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and France (5 – 7). In 2006, a total of 893 cases were detected in Germany, but the source of initial virus introduction remains unknown.

40|$|Transcription-mediated {{amplification}} (TMA) is an isothermal, autocatalytic target amplification method {{which has}} the potential to detect less than 50 hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA copies/ml (10 IU/ml). The TMA assay was used to assess the presence of residual HCV RNA in plasma from patients treated with polyethylene glycol-modified interferon α- 2 a (peginterferon α- 2 a) who showed a virologic relapse after the end of therapy. Stored end-of-treatment and end-of-follow-up plasma samples from 177 of 267 patients treated with peginterferon α- 2 a (S. Zeuzem et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 343 : 1666 – 1672, 2000) were available for <b>retesting</b> <b>by</b> TMA. Plasma <b>samples</b> from patients in the same study who exhibited virologic relapse after treatment with standard interferon α- 2 a served as controls. Virologic response during the trial was defined as HCV RNA that was undetectable using a PCR-based test system with a sensitivity of 50 IU/mL (Cobas Amplicor HCV version 2. 0) and was compared with TMA-based retesting results (VERSANT HCV RNA Qualitative Assay). Residual HCV RNA was detected in 4 of 60 cases (7 %) by the TMA technology in end-of-treatment plasma samples from patients who relapsed after receiving peginterferon α- 2 a and in 6 of 18 patients (33 %) following therapy with standard interferon α- 2 a. For peginterferon α- 2 a-treated patients with sustained virologic response, HCV RNA was detectable by TMA in end-of-treatment samples in 3 of 78 cases but in none of the end-of-follow-up samples. For all end-of-treatment and end-of-follow-up plasma samples of virologic nonresponders, a complete concordance between the PCR-based assay and TMA was observed. In conclusion, in patients with virologic relapse after the end of therapy, according to PCR, who were treated with peginterferon α- 2 a or standard interferon α- 2 a, residual HCV RNA was detectable in end-of-treatment <b>samples</b> <b>by</b> the TMA-based assay in 7 or 33 % of cases, respectively. The lower rate of residual HCV RNA detection by TMA for patients treated with peginterferon α- 2 a than that for patients treated with standard interferon α- 2 a {{may be due to the}} maintained antiviral pressure of the long-acting peginterferon α- 2 a at the end-of-treatment visit...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Micro-immuno¯uorescence (MIF) {{is widely}} used for {{chlamydia}} antibody testing (CAT). Recently a species-speci®c MIF and three enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests have been introduced. We com-pared ®ve commercially available CAT tests, using laparoscopy as a reference, and evaluated whether combinations of tests could improve the predictive value of CAT. METHODS: In a consecutive cohort of 315 subfertile women, results of the ®ve CAT tests were correlated to ®ndings at laparoscopy. Likelihood and odds ratios (OR) were calcu-lated for single tests and for combinations of tests. RESULTS: Of the tests evaluated, MIF Labsystems had the best diagnostic performance (OR 15. 7), while pELISA Medac (OR 8. 2) {{was the best of}} the three ELISA tests. Stepwise logistic regression analysis showed that performance of MIF Labsystems could not be improved by adding a second test. Signi®cant cross-reactivity with C. pneumoniae antibodies was found in all tests evaluated, except in pELISA Medac. CONCLUSIONS: In screening for tubal factor subfertility, MIF Labsystems was superior to the ELISA tests evaluated, and combining two CAT tests did not improve its predictive value. Economic analysis will show whether serial testing by pELISA Medac, and <b>retesting</b> positive <b>samples</b> <b>by</b> MIF Labsystems, is most cost-effective.

Design: The present study was a case control study Setting: This study was conducted at the Microbiology Department at Elemies National Hospital in Sabia, Gizan, Saudi Arabia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and genotyping techniques were conducted at Alborg Laboratories, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Objectives: This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of HCV infection among pregnant women, the predominant HCV genotype among infected pregnant and non-pregnant, and to find out whether there is any difference in genotype and subtype among the two study groups. Methods: Five ml of blood samples were obtained from 600 women, pregnant and non-pregnant (300 from each group). HCV antibodies were detected in plasma by using immuno-chromatography test (ICT) and enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay (ELISA). All positive and equivocal samples were <b>retested</b> for confirmation <b>by</b> polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR reactive specimens were processed for HCV genotyping by line probe assay (LiPA v 2. 0).

METHODS: A 1268 base pair DNA fragment, containing parts of the genes for E coli heat labile enterotoxin (LT) and heat stable enterotoxins (ST 1 a and ST 1 b), was random prime labelled with digoxigenin-dUTP. The labelled DNA {{was used as a}} probe in colony hybridisation reactions to examine 180 E coli strains of which 92 had previously been shown by a cell culture assay to produce LT. Six LT negative ST 1 positive E coli, 34 Verotoxin producing E coli (VTEC), and 84 organisms from other genera were also examined. All organisms other than VTEC were isolated from travellers returning from abroad with diarrhoea. All E coli strains were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> cell culture for LT, and were tested by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for ST 1, and by the trivalent and individual DNA probes. RESULTS: All 81 isolates, that on <b>retesting</b> <b>by</b> cell culture were positive for LT, also hybridised with the trivalent and LT probes; 27 of these were also enzyme immunoassay (EIA) positive for ST 1 of which 24 hybridised with the ST 1 b probe and three with the ST 1 a probe. Of 99 isolates, that on <b>retesting</b> <b>by</b> cell culture were negative for LT, all were negative by LT probe and only three were EIA positive for ST 1; these three were positive by both trivalent and ST 1 b probes. Four isolates were positive by the trivalent probe but negative by cell culture and EIA; all four were positive by ST 1 b probe. Compared with the cell culture assay for LT, the probe had a sensitivity and specificity both of 100 %; compared with the EIA for ST 1, the probe had a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 88 %.

In 1991, 33 samples from 33 sites were tested and MAV was detected in four of 12 samples of Pennisetum clandestinum found infected with BYDV. Presence of MAV was confirmed <b>by</b> <b>retesting</b> these <b>samples</b> using MAV specific monoclonal antibodies. In 1992, 802 samples from 16 grass species {{were collected}} from 579 sites in six regions. BYDV was detected in 214 (27 %) samples at 178 (31 %) sites. MAV was found in 50 % and RMV in 38 % of infected samples. Both were found either alone or in mixed infections with each other or with PAV and/or RPV; all four serotypes were found in 18 (8 %) infected samples. The most important hosts were four perennials: Cynodon dactylon, Eragrostis curvula, Paspalum dilatatum and P. clandestinum. Eight other perennial and five annual grass species were also infected. MAV was most commonly found in C. dactylon and P. clandestinum and RMV in P. dilatatum. All four serotypes were present in the six regions sampled, but the relative proportions of the serotypes found varied from region to region. This paper represents the first extensive survey of MAV and RMV serotypes of BYDV in over-summering grasses in Australia. Aphid species found during this survey infesting over-summering grasses were Rhopalosiphum padi, R. maidis and Hysteroneura setariae.

40|$|A {{nucleic acid}} photo-cross-linking {{technology}} {{was used to}} develop a direct assay for the quantification of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA levels in serum. Cross-linker-modified DNA probes complementary to the viral genomes of the major HBV subtypes were synthesized and used in an assay that could be completed in less than 6 h. The quantification range of the assay, as determined by testing serial dilutions of Eurohep HBV reference standards and cloned HBV DNA, was 5 × 105 to 3 × 109 molecules of HBV DNA/ml of serum. Within-run and between-run coefficients of variation (CVs) for the assay were 4. 3 and 4. 0 %, respectively. The assay {{was used to determine}} HBV DNA levels in 302 serum samples, and the results were compared to those obtained after testing the same samples with the Chiron branched-DNA (bDNA) assay for HBV DNA. Of the samples tested, 218 were positive for HBV DNA by both assays and 72 gave results below the cutoff for both assays. Of the remaining 12 samples, 10 were positive for HBV DNA by the cross-linking assay only; the 2 other <b>samples</b> were positive <b>by</b> the bDNA assay only. Twenty-eight samples had to be <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> the bDNA assay (CV, > 20 % between the results obtained from the testing of each sample in duplicate), whereas only three <b>samples</b> required <b>retesting</b> <b>by</b> the cross-linking assay.

J.) {{was used}} as a {{screening}} tool for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in first-void urine (FVU) specimens from 3, 340 asymptomatic women attending European health care units for contraceptive advice or pregnancy termination. All samples were kept frozen (- 20 degrees C) prior to testing. Chlamydia-positive <b>samples</b> were <b>retested</b> once <b>by</b> the plasmid-based PCR kit and also by a major outer membrane protein (MOMP) primer-based PCR. Discrepancies were resolved by using the direct immunofluorescence test (DIF) with the centrifuged sediment of the FVU specimens. Samples positive for N. gonorrhoeae were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> chromosomal primer-based PCR and verified by a 16 S RNA PCR. Of the samples tested, 1. 8 % were considered inhibitory by using the internal amplification control. Of 81 samples positive for C. trachomatis, 74 <b>samples</b> were positive <b>by</b> both plasmid- and MOMP-based PCRs, 6 <b>samples</b> were positive <b>by</b> plasmid-based PCR and DIF, and one <b>sample</b> was positive <b>by</b> both MOMP-based PCR and DIF. Nine samples (0. 3 %) were positive for N. gonorrhoeae by the chromosomal primer-based PCR; however, none of the results could be confirmed. The test offers the unique ability to identify inhibition of amplification with the optional internal control...|$|R
40|$|An {{anonymous}} unlinked seroprevalence {{study of}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection was performed by testing pools of ten sera remaining from specimens submitted consecutively to clinical pathology laboratories at 18 Italian public hospitals during four consecutive days in April 1991. Sera from positive pools were <b>retested</b> individually <b>by</b> three different enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) and considered positive if reactive by all three assays. Only the sera with discordant ELA results were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> Western blot. Of a total of 22, 590 sera, 278 were HIV positive (1. 2 %). The highest rates were seen in hospitals located in metropolitan areas (1. 5 %), in infectious disease departments (28 %) and in drug addiction treatment units (28 %); among men aged 21 - 30 (4. 6 %) and 31 - 40 years (4 %); and among women aged 21 - 30 years (1. 6 %). The distribution of seropositive patients by gender and age group suggests an increasing role of heterosexual transmission of the infection. The presence of anti-HIV antibodies in sera from patients of both sexes, in all age groups, and from all clinical settings reinforces the need for health care workers to adhere to universal precautions issued to prevent occupational bloodborne infections...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} three CDC-suggested {{approaches for}} confirming positive nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) for Chlamydia trachomatis: (i) repeat the original test {{on the original}} specimen, (ii) retest the original specimen with a different test, and (iii) perform a different test on a duplicate specimen. For approach 1, specimens (genital swabs or first-catch urine [FCU]) initially positive by the Abbott LCx Probe System Chlamydia trachomatis Assay (LCx; Abbott Laboratories), the APTIMA Combo 2 Assay (AC 2; Gen-Probe Inc.), the Amplicor CT/NG Assay (PCR; Roche Diagnostics Corp.), or the BD ProbeTec ET System C. trachomatis amplified-DNA assay (SDA; Becton Dickinson Diagnostic Systems) were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> the same NAAT. In several evaluations, multiple {{efforts were made to}} confirm the original positive result. For approach 2, specimens initially positive by SDA and the Hybrid Capture 2 CT-ID DNA Test (HC 2; Digene Corp.) were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> different NAATs (SDA, PCR, AC 2, and the APTIMA assay for C. trachomatis [ACT]). For approach 3, duplicate male urethral or cervical swabs were tested by SDA or by both AC 2 and ACT. FCU specimens were tested by all three tests. We found that 84 to 98 % of SDA, LCx, PCR, and AC 2 positive results were confirmed by a repeat test and that 89 to 99 % of SDA and AC 2 and 93 % of HC 2 positive results were confirmed by different NAATs, but that some NAATs cannot be used to confirm other NAATs. The use of repeat testing did not confirm 11 % of C. trachomatis SDA positive results that could be confirmed by more extensive testing. Doing more testing confirms more positive results; > 90 % of all positive NAATs could be confirmed...|$|R
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{three of}} the CDC approaches for confirming Neisseria gonorrhoeae (gonococcus [GC]) -positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results: (i) repeating the original test on the original specimen, (ii) testing the original specimen with a different test, and (iii) performing a different test on a duplicate specimen collected at the same visit. For the first approach, clinical specimens were initially tested by Aptima Combo 2 (AC 2) (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, CA), ProbeTec (strand displacement amplification [SDA]) (Becton Dickinson Co., Sparks, MD), and Amplicor (PCR) (Roche Molecular Systems, Branchburg, NJ). The original GC-positive specimens were then <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> the same NAAT for confirmation. For the second approach, specimens initially positive by AC 2, SDA, or PCR were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> different NAATs (SDA, PCR, AC 2, and Aptima Neisseria gonorrhoeae assay [AGC]; Gen-Probe Inc.). For the third approach, duplicate urethral swabs and first-catch urine (FCU) samples from men and duplicate cervical swabs and FCU samples from women were each tested by SDA, AC 2, and AGC in parallel. We found that 89 to 96 % of <b>samples</b> positive <b>by</b> SDA, PCR, and AC 2 were confirmed by repeat testing and that 85 to 98 % of SDA, PCR, and AC 2 results were confirmed by using different NAATs on the original specimen. For FCU samples from men, any NAAT {{can be used for}} confirmation. However, for all other specimen types, some NAATs cannot be used to confirm positive results from other NAATs. Thus, a single repeat test appears to be a reliable method for confirmation, but by doing more extensive testing, an additional 5 % were confirmed. With > 90 % of all GC-positive NAATs being confirmed, our results show that confirmatory testing is not warranted for these genital specimens...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Antipituitary (APA) but not antihypothalamus {{antibodies}} (AHA) {{have been}} investigated in patients with idiopathic hypopituitarism. This study searched for APA and AHA {{in some of these}} patients to investigate whether pituitary or hypothalamic autoimmunity could play a role in their pituitary dysfunction. DESIGN: Sixty-six patients with selective idiopathic hypopituitarism were studied: 27 with ACTH deficiency, 20 with GH deficiency and 19 with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Twenty patients with hypopituitarism secondary to hypophysectomy and 50 healthy subjects were enrolled as controls. MEASUREMENTS: Antipituitary and AHA were evaluated by indirect immunofluorescence in sera of patients and controls. Positive sera were <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> a four-layer double immunofluorescence to identify the cells targeted by these antibodies. RESULTS: Antipituitary were present at high titre in 4 of 27 patients with ACTH deficiency (14 · 8...|$|R

40|$|A {{long term}} {{follow-up}} study {{was carried out}} of girls given RA 27 / 3 or Cendehill rubella vaccine in their 13 th- 14 th year compared {{with a group of}} girls who had been found to be naturally immune at the age. A high proportion of the girls in all groups had persistent rubella antibody six to seven years after inclusion in the study, although some of these would have been considered to be susceptible to rubella by methods currently in use for screening for rubella antibody. Great care should be taken in interpreting the efficiency of the schoolgirl immunisation policy in the United Kingdom; women in their childbearing years who may have received vaccine but are found by a screening test to be seronegative should be <b>retested</b> <b>by</b> a more sensitive procedure before a final report is made...|$|R
