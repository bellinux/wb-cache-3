50|$|While {{testing the}} 3-cylinder, Kawasaki also went {{forward with the}} {{development}} and testing of its current two-stroke twin-cylinder <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve engine. The preliminary test results pointed to a very promising outcome. One possible advancement in the twin over the triple was keeping the <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve fuel/air intake which produced more horsepower than the conventional piston port or reed valve means {{which has been the}} case in other Kawasakis.|$|R
50|$|Engine: Two-stroke single {{cylinder}} <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve induction, four gears, {{running on a}} 20:1 mix of petrol and two-stroke oil.|$|R
5000|$|The Rotax Engine design used a {{slightly}} unusual style of intake. A compact <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> system was employed and this plate was altered between T'n'T (track and trail) and MX models {{to provide the}} desired power curve. This compact <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> is accredited with the horsepower gain over conventional piston port engines used on Japanese motorcycles. The MX3, produced in 1977, was the pinnacle of Can Am. Its [...] was 6 hp more than the closest competitor.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic field-assisted fine {{polishing}} method has been proposed, {{which uses a}} magnetic slurry mixed non-ferrous abrasives into a magnetic fluid. Polishing machine has newly been developed which is consisted both of copper <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> set a strong permanent magnet and a rotary shaft set similar one, it is mounted a specimen to be polished. Magnetic field strength controlled by moving their magnets is responsible for yielding superior surface quality. It is found that polishing machine has high performance finishing ability and the usage {{of a variety of}} magnetic fluid is proposed versatile polishing characteristics. Experiments show that kerosene based magnetic fluid has very high polishing performance compared with water based one. The usage of coarse grain gives rise to increase the surface roughnes, and larger clearance between specimen and copper <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> lowers finishing rate of wafer in kerosene based magnetic fluid especially.

40|$|Concerning the {{crankcase}} compression type {{two stroke}} cycle engines that inlet port control mechanism is piston valve and is <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve, {{the influences of}} the engine speed and the back-pressure of the scavenging port upon the delivery ratio were studied. The results are obtained as follows : (1) When the back-pressure of the scavenging port P_d is constant, extending over the wide range, the delivery ratio of the <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve engine is larger {{than that of the}} piston valve engine. (2) As the back-pressure of the scavenging port P_d increases, the piston valve engine speed that gives the largest value of the delivery ratio moves to the region of higher engine speed, and does not move in the <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve engine. (3) In the region of the low engine speed, suction air G and the back-pressure of the scaveging port P_d are satisfied with the equation as follows : ･･･[the rest omitted...|$|R

50|$|The S2 Mach II was a 350 cc Kawasaki {{motorcycle}} introduced for the 1972 {{model year}} and discontinued {{at the end}} of the 1974 model year. It had a 3-cylinder two-stroke engine with a displacement of , and superseded the <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve twin-cylinder Kawasaki A7 Avenger.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} {{advanced}} for its time, with features normally seen on race bikes: two-cylinder, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil injected, dual rotary valve. While other manufactures had utilised {{the advantages of}} <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve induction on small single-cylinder machines, only Kawasaki and Bridgestone produced twin-cylinder machines. <b>Rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve induction ensures that the all the fuel charge is used and not partly lost (as in a piston ported engine). As a result, it produces more power, more torque at low revs and better response throughout the rev range. The engine's initial air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was drawn through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head, then down into the internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors.|$|R
50|$|Cinematography uses a <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> shutter {{in movie}} cameras, a {{continuously}} spinning disc which conceals the image with a reflex mirror during the intermittent motion between frame exposure. The disc then spins {{to an open}} section that exposes the next frame of film while it is held by the registration pin.|$|R
50|$|This {{combination}} of displacement (247cc), CDI system, and <b>rotary</b> <b>discs</b> produced 31 hp (23.1 KW) @ 8000 RPM gave the Samurai a power-to-weight ratio of 1 horsepower per 11 pounds of weight, a 0-60 mph of 6.6 second, making the Samurai as fast or faster than production competitors in its class.|$|R
50|$|In movie projection, {{the shutter}} admits {{light from the}} lamphouse to {{illuminate}} the film across to the projection screen. To avoid flicker, a double-bladed <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> shutter admits light two times per frame of film. There are also some models which are triple-bladed, and thus admit light three times per frame (see Persistence of vision).|$|R
50|$|Their answers {{determined}} a five-digit code {{which will}} stop the wheel from Spinning. The other team member will have to guess his or her teammate's answers, by rotating the <b>rotary</b> <b>discs</b> to the corresponding numbers to stop the wheel. The first team to guess correctly and stop the wheel would win the Versus and was safe from elimination.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine was}} a unique {{straight}} twin, two-stroke, air-cooled, oil-injected, dual <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve. The engine's ignition air supply began in an air filter canister below the seat and was pulled through a large plenum chamber just above the transmission and behind the cylinder head then downward into the two internal passages leading to the carburetor housing feeding the carburetors. The A1 had two Mikuni carburetors located on the engine's left and right sides and inline with the crankshaft. The carburetors were enclosed and protected from the elements by carburetor covers fixed to the crankcase. Inboard of each carburetor, and supporting each carburetor, was the <b>disc</b> cover. The <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve was housed inboard of that cover. The A1 Samurai motor was lubricated by the Superlube system, with 2-stroke oil directly injected in the intake tract.Previously equipped with points, the ignition system was equipped in 1969 with a Capacitor discharge ignition including thyristor-based switching system then increased the voltage to between 25,000 and 30,000 volts reducing the unburned fuel mixture within the cylinders.|$|R
50|$|The C2SS was {{designed}} for the street scrambler, a road machine powered by a single cylinder, two stroke, <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve engine with displacement of 115cc. It was street legal having headlight, taillight, and license plate bracket. It had chrome fenders front and rear, a crossbar on the handlebars, universal tires, an upswept right side chrome exhaust system, and apparent good ground clearance. The bike was available in either red, blue, or silver with the fuel tank having rubber knee grips.|$|R
50|$|K*bots {{score points}} for attacks with an active weapon (e.g. a flipper, hammer or <b>rotary</b> <b>disc)</b> and damage caused to an opponent’s K*bot. Operators may also lose penalty points for {{infringements}} {{of the operation}} regulations. The K*bot amassing the most points during a 90-second match is adjudged to be the winner. If both K*bots are tied for points after 90 seconds, they will enter a short overtime shootout in which the first K*bot to score a point is the winner.|$|R
5000|$|The Mach I was {{a direct}} result of the {{widespread}} success of the Kawasaki H1 Mach III 500 cc introduced in 1969. The Mach I's engine was a three-cylinder two-stroke with an engine displacement of 249 cc (15.1 cubic inches) which produced 32 bhp @ 8000 rpm, a power-to-weight ratio of [...] to every 11.8 pounds. The S1 Mach I replaced the twin Kawasaki A1 Samurai 250 with its twin-cylinder, Kawasaki <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve engine which produced [...] @ 8000 rpm.|$|R
40|$|A dual-purpose disc {{agrochemical}} applicator {{for field}} crops {{was developed to}} boost agricultural mechanization in crop production and also to overcome the safety concern of hazardous spray drift during agrochemical application by the field crop farmers. The dual purpose agrochemical applicator was mounted on a high clearance tractor and tested {{with respect to the}} granular fertilizer distribution patterns uniformity/liquid chemical uniformity of droplet sizes in spraying of the agrochemical. Results for NPK granular chemical indicated that, at low (50 kg/ha) and high (150 kg/ha) application rates with 550 rpm disc speed, distribution patterns skewed to the left whereas the distribution pattern at medium (100 kg/ha) application rates was good flattop. Also at high application rate with 1000 rpm disc speed, mean distribution pattern became poor (W-shape). For the liquid chemical herbicide HC 48 amine liquid, the mean values of volume median diameter (VMD) and number median diameter (NMD) were 108 µm and 80 µm at 90 lt/ha application rate at 5000 rpm <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> speed, and also 344 and 222 µm at 30 lt/ha application rate with 2000 rpm <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> speed.

50|$|From the 1960s {{through the}} 1990s, small {{two-stroke}} motorcycles were popular worldwide, {{partly as a}} result of the pioneering work of the East German Daniel Zimmermann (<b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve) and MZ's Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when Ernst Degner, the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.|$|R

The nonlinear model obtained from energy and mass balances, is validated with real data measured in two plants of fishmeal located {{in the north of}} Peru. A constrained nonlinear predictive controller is designed with the purpose of regulating the moisture content in the fishmeal to obtain a stable final product. Simulation results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the controller to handle input, slew-rate and output constraints even for the case of short prediction horizons...|$|R
50|$|In {{motion picture}} cameras, the ground glass is a small, usually {{removable}} piece of transparent glass that sits between the <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> shutter and the viewfinder. The ground glass usually contains precise markings {{to show the}} camera operator {{the boundaries of the}} frame or the center reticle, or any other important information. Because the ground glass is positioned between the mirror shutter and the viewfinder, it does not interfere with the image reaching the film and is therefore not recorded over the final image, but rather serves as a reference for the camera operator.|$|R

40|$|Citriculture {{normally}} uses high application volumes in pesticide solutions (of 2. 000 to 5. 000 L ha(- 1)) {{to control}} pests and diseases {{that affect the}} crop, which generates an increase in operational costs. For this reason, diverse systems of application are being developed to reduce application volumes and improve the uniformity of pesticide deposition. The goal of this work was to evaluate the efficiency of two application systems of pesticides in citrus trees. One system used a prototype for terrestrial application with <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> atomizers that are widely used in agricultural aviation, and the other system used hollow cone tip hydraulics. For {{the treatment of the}} trees the insecticide Metidation was used at the dose of 180 gr per hectare. To study the droplet spectrum, water-sensitive papers were installed at different positions in the trees canopy, and for the study of insecticide deposition leaves of the treated plants were collected. The water-sensitive papers were collected and analyzed using a computerized image analysis system (e-Sprinkle, EMBRAPA, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the leaves analyzed by the technique of gas chromatography. Pesticide deposition was similar in both application system, although the solution volume used by the application system equipped with <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> atomizers was one quarter of the volume used by the application system equipped with hydraulic tips, reducing considerably the cost of the phytosanitary treatments...|$|R
50|$|Digital image sensors (both CMOS and CCD image sensors) can be {{constructed}} to give a shutter equivalent function by transferring many pixel cell charges at one time to a paired shaded double called frame transfer shutter. If the full-frame is transferred at one time, it is a global shutter. Often the shaded cells can independently be read, while the others are again collecting light. Extremely fast shutter operation is possible as there are no moving parts or any serialized data transfers. Global shutter {{can also be used}} for videos as a replacement for <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> shutters.|$|R
50|$|The narrow {{valley of}} the Wupper did not leave the space for a loop on the 40 m long, but only 8 m wide {{transfer}} stop of the streetcar. The confined area between the river and a steep slope proved particularly problematic. Therefore, according to the two above-mentioned models from the UK, an automatically operated <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> with a diameter of 7.5 m was alternatively installed for the trolley line 3 at that time. This was sufficient for the trolley type ÜHIIIs, which was then exclusively used. Originally the system was manually operated by the driver {{by means of a}} hand crank.|$|R
40|$|Abstract- Researchers {{all over}} the world have been {{studying}} microbial cellulose- which is a biopolymer- {{for more than a century}} as it is receiving great attention for its wide applications. Many researches have been carrying out in order to find better methods of microbial production at a large scale. Using <b>Rotary</b> <b>Discs</b> Reactor (RDR) is one of the alternatives to produce higher yield of microbial cellulose. This study has been done to compare production of microbial cellulose using RDR with the traditional static fermentation method. A series of fermentation in static culture and RDR were run at room temperature with pH ranging from 4 to 6. Results showed that fermentation carried out using RDR gave 86. 78 % higher production of microbial cellulose than that from static fermentation. In this study, RDR fermentation with speed rotation of 7 rpm gave the highest resultant wet weight which was 139. 78 grams. It was also found that too high rotational speed in RDR caused decrease in microbial cellulose production as it affects stability of the culture. It can be concluded that fermentation using RDR can give higher yield because of better oxygen supply where the A. xylinum cultures were in direct contact with air by the rotation of discs. Furthermore, the RDR provided larger surface area for the microorganisms attachment compared to the static fermentation.

50|$|Like IFA, Engineer Daniel Zimmermann (born 1902) {{based his}} ZPH engine on the pre-war DKW RT-125 which he heavily {{modified}} {{by adding a}} disc valve that allowed asymmetric port timing with a longer duration inlet phase. Zimmermann also used a new crankshaft providing 'square' bore and stroke dimensions (54mm x 54mm) and used stuffing rings to boost the primary compression ratio. However, the East German government didn't like the competition between the two East Germans and persuaded Zimmermann to reveal his engine's secrets to Kaaden. The result was the 1953 IFA racer that featured a <b>rotary</b> <b>disc</b> valve - as per Zimmermann - from 1953.|$|R
40|$|Commonly, biocellulose was {{harvested}} from trees and cotton. However, Acetobacter xylinum, a gram-negative bacteria was discovered {{as being the}} microorganism capable of producing biocellulose by fermentation. This first generation of biocellulose is widely known as Nata whereby in Malaysia, this biocellulose was only produced as a dessert by food industries. However, there are some excellent properties of biocellulose make it able {{to be used in}} many fields. The modified biocellulose used for application other than dessert is defined as second generation biocellulose. This work aims to transfer the technology of a modified method for producing the second generation of biocellulose from bacteria. In this program, the designed <b>Rotary</b> <b>Discs</b> Reactor was being introduced to the company as a new method for biocellulose production. Efforts will be made {{with the help of the}} company to optimize and upscale the <b>Rotary</b> <b>Discs</b> Reactor for high production yield of biocellulose. This includes support for the expertise in fabricating, instrumentation, space and operational aspects. The biocellulose produced were further processed into a film for heavy metal removal in wastewater and powder as an additive in cement materials. This cooperation leads to a profitable outcome for the company by 30 % improvement in the production rate of biocellulose compared to conventional static fermentation (tray methods) and opens for new applications of biocellulose. On the other hand, the company, university, and students gain benefits from sharing knowledge, facilities, intellectual properties, expertise, increase networking and at the same time enhance the graduate attributes for a future working environment...|$|R
