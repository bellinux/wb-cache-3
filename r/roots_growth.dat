The {{mutation in}} COI 1, that plays {{a central role}} in JA signaling, displays insensitivity to JA inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> To dissect JA signaling pathway, we recently isolated one mutant named psc 1, which partially suppresses coi 1 insensitivity to JA inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> As we identified the PSC 1 gene as an allele of DWF 4 that encodes a key enzyme in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis, we hypothesized and demonstrated that BR is involved in JA signaling and negatively regulates JA inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> In our Plant Physiology paper, we analyzed effects of psc 1 or exogenous BR on the inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> by JA. Here we show that treatment with brassinazole (Brz), a BR biosynthesis inhibitor, increased JA sensitivity in both coi 1 - 2 and wild type, which further confirms that BR negatively regulates JA inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> Since effects of psc 1, Brz and exogenous BR on JA inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> were mild, we suggests that BR negatively finely regulates JA inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> in Arabidopsis...|$|R
40|$|<b>Root</b> <b>growth</b> in Nicotiana attenuata is transiently reduced after {{application}} of oral secretions (OS) of Manduca sexta larvae to wounds in leaves. Feeding of M. sexta or OS elicitation {{is known to}} result in jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene bursts, and activates a suite of defence responses. Because both plant hormones are known to strongly reduce <b>root</b> <b>growth,</b> their activation might account for the observed reduction of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> following herbivory. To test this hypothesis, we measured primary <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> with digital image sequence processing at high temporal resolution in antisense-lipoxygenase 3 (asLOX 3) and inverted repeat-coronatin-insensitive 1 (irCOI 1) seedlings which are impaired in JA biosynthesis and perception, respectively, and wild-type (WT) seedlings.

40|$|Purpose.  The {{purpose of}} {{present study was}} to propose {{improved}} full scale of morphologically distinct phases of germinating barley seeds and on the bases of that scale to determine each phase time of start and its duration. Methods. Seeds of five spring and five winter varieties have been germinated under optimal condition от paper in plastic bags. Morphology of each seed was registered during seven 24 -hour-periods (until seed full germination) with 2 hours interval. On the bases of obtained data we made the description of each phase and calculated the time of its commencement and duration. Results. New improved scale of germinating barley seeds phases, which we named “microphenological phases of seed germination” (MPPSG), is created and each phase is described. The scale consists of eight phases, both well-known (dry seed, start of seed imbibition, radicle emergence, coleoptile emergence and seedling coming-to-be) and three new phases of <b>roots</b> <b>growth</b> (Roots 1 of “fork”, Roots 2 of “short roots” and Roots 3 or “long roots”).

As a result, we have identified a loss-of-function allele of BREVIS RADIX (BRX) in the Columbia background, named brx- 2, which shows enhanced response to ABA-mediated inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> BRX encodes a key regulator of cell proliferation and elongation in the root, which has been implicated in the brassinosteroid (BR) pathway {{as well as in the}} regulation of auxin-responsive gene expression. Mutants affected in BR signaling that are not impaired in <b>root</b> <b>growth,</b> such as bes 1 -D, bzr 1 -D, and bsu 1 -D, also showed enhanced sensitivity to ABA-mediated inhibition of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> Triple loss-of-function mutants affected in PP 2 Cs, which act as negative regulators of ABA signaling, showed impaired <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> in the absence of exogenous ABA, indicating that disturbed regulation of ABA sensitivity impairs <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> In agreement with this result, diminishing ABA sensitivity of brx- 2 by crossing it with a 35 S:HAB 1 ABA-insensitive line allowed significantly higher recovery of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> after brassinolide treatment.

40|$|Abstract: Background and aimsThe use of {{standard}} dynamic root architecture models to simulate <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> in soil containing macropores failed to reproduce experimentally observed <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> patterns. We thus developed a new, more mechanistic model approach for the simulation of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> in structured soil. Methods: In our alternative modelling approach, we distinguish between, firstly, {{the driving force}} for <b>root</b> <b>growth,</b> which {{is determined by the}} orientation of the previous root segment and the influence of gravitropism and, secondly, soil mechanical resistance to <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> The latter is expressed by its inverse, soil mechanical conductance, and treated similarly to hydraulic conductivity in Darcy’s law. At the presence of macropores, soil mechanical conductance is anisotropic, which leads to a difference between the direction of the driving force and the direction of the root tip movement. Results: The model was tested using data from the literature, at pot scale, at macropore scale, and in a series of simulations where sensitivity to gravity and macropore orientation was evaluated. Conclusions: Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between simulated and experimentally observed root systems showed good agreement, suggesting that the drawn analogy between soil water flow and <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> is a useful one...|$|R
40|$|In the {{ecological}} model plant Nicotiana attenuata, leaf wounding or herbivory {{lead to a}} reduction of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> via jasmonic acid (JA) signaling. A single wounding treatment is sufficient to induce this response; multiple wounding does not increase the plant growth reaction. in a recent study, in which JA bursts were elicited in leaves of the molecular model species Arabidopsis thaliana in different ways, 1 we tested whether JA induces the same response there. <b>Root</b> <b>growth</b> reduction was neither induced by foliar application of herbivore oral secretions nor by direct application of methyl jasmonate to leaves. <b>Root</b> <b>growth</b> reduction was observed when leaves were infected with the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, which persistently induces the JA signaling pathway. Yet, growth analyses of this effect in wild type and JA-signaling mutants showed that it was elicited by the bacterial toxin coronatine which suggests ethylene—but not JA-induced <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> reduction in A. thaliana. Moreover, the growth effects were somewhat masked by a light-induced diurnal decrease of <b>root</b> <b>growth.</b> Overall, we conclude that the reaction of <b>root</b> <b>growth</b> to herbivore-induced JA signaling differs among species, which is related to different ecological defence strategies that have evolved in different species...|$|R
