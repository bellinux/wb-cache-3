2500|$|The Italian word [...] "stiletto" [...] {{comes from}} the Latin stilus, the thin pointed <b>Roman</b> <b>writing</b> {{instrument}} used to engrave wax or clay tablets in ancient times. [...] The stiletto began to gain fame during the late Middle Ages, when it was the secondary weapon of knights. [...] Originally designed as a purely offensive weapon, the stiletto was used to finish off a fallen or severely wounded heavily armored opponent. The needle-like blade could, if used with sufficient force, penetrate most mail or find its way through gaps in a knight's plate armor, and was narrow enough {{to pass through the}} eye slits of the helmeted knight. [...] A severely wounded opponent, who was not expected to survive, would be given a [...] "mercy strike" [...] (French coup de grâce), hence the name miséricorde. Later the Gunner's Stiletto became a tool for clearing cannon-fuse touch holes; used in the manner of an automotive oil dipstick, they were often inscribed with marks indicating levels of powder charges for ranging distance.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Roman</b> <b>writing</b> {{as a whole}} {{demonstrates}} a deep ambivalence towards the gladiatoria munera. Even the most complex and sophisticated munera of the Imperial era evoked the ancient, ancestral dii manes of the underworld and were framed by the protective, lawful rites of sacrificium. Their popularity made their co-option by the state inevitable; Cicero acknowledged their sponsorship as a political imperative. Despite the popular adulation of gladiators, they were set apart, despised; and despite Cicero's contempt for the mob, he shared their admiration: [...] "Even when [...] have been felled, let alone when they are standing and fighting, they never disgrace themselves. And suppose a gladiator has {{been brought to the}} ground, when do you ever see one twist his neck away after he has been ordered to extend it for the death blow?" [...] His own death would later emulate this example. Yet, Cicero could also refer to his popularist opponent Clodius, publicly and scathingly, as a bustuarius– literally, a [...] "funeral-man", implying that Clodius has shown the moral temperament of the lowest sort of gladiator. Such finer distinctions aside, [...] "gladiator" [...] could be (and was) used as an insult throughout the Roman period, and [...] "Samnite" [...] doubled the insult, despite the popularity of the Samnite type. Silius Italicus wrote, as the games approached their peak, that the degenerate Campanians had devised the very worst of precedents, which now threatened the moral fabric of Rome: [...] "It was their custom to enliven their banquets with bloodshed and to combine with their feasting the horrid sight of armed men [...] fighting; often the combatants fell dead above the very cups of the revelers, and the tables were stained with streams of blood. Thus demoralised was Capua." [...] Death could be rightly meted out as punishment, or met with equanimity in peace or war, as a gift of fate; but when inflicted as entertainment, with no underlying moral or religious purpose, it could only pollute and demean those who witnessed it.|$|E
6000|$|But {{the removal}} to Britain {{effected}} one immense change. [...] "War begat the king." [...] In Sleswick the English had lived within their little marks as free and independent communities. In Britain all the clans of each colony gradually {{came under the}} military command of a king. The ealdormen who led the various marauding bands assumed royal power in the new country. Such a change was indeed inevitable. For not only had the English to win the new England, but they had also to keep it and extend it. During four hundred years a constant smouldering warfare was carried on between the foreigners and the native Welsh on their western frontier. Thus the townships of each colony entered into a closer union with one another for military purposes, and so arose the separate chieftainships or petty kingdoms of early England. But the king's power was originally very small. He was merely the semi-hereditary general and representative of the people, of royal stock, but elected by the free suffrages of the freemen. Only as the kingdoms coalesced, and as the power of meeting became consequently less, did the king acquire his greater prerogatives. From the first, however, {{he seems to have}} possessed the right of granting public lands, with the consent of the freemen, to particular individuals; and such book-land, as the early English called it, after the introduction of <b>Roman</b> <b>writing,</b> became the origin of our system of private property in land.|$|E

50|$|In the 15th century, a {{new type}} of ink had to be {{developed}} in Europe for the printing press by Johannes Gutenberg.

Two types of ink were prevalent at the time: the Greek and <b>Roman</b> <b>writing</b> ink (soot, glue, and water) and the 12th century variety composed of ferrous sulfate, gall, gum, and water. Neither of these handwriting inks could adhere to printing surfaces without creating blurs.
