5|$|The Saint-Julien {{church is}} named after Julian the Hospitaller, patron of Cubzac. Julian is a legendary saint destined to kill his parents, and {{informed}} about his destiny by a stag. He fled to escape his fate, but the prophecy realized nonetheless, and he became a hermit, helping people cross a river. One day, the Christ arrived to announce his pardon. From the Middle Ages to the French Revolution, the town would have been called Saint-Julien-de-Cubzac. The church is made of limestone and underwent important modifications in the 19th century, when in particular the steeple was rebuilt. The façade, however, still contains Roman remains. The church holds an 18th-century painting of the Baptism of Christ, classified Monument historique in 1913. The church {{is surrounded by a}} cemetery which was excavated in August 1978 by archaeologists under the direction of Richard Boudet. Coins dating from the time of Francis I, Henry III, Henry IV, Louis XIII, Napoleon III and Victor Emmanuel were uncovered. A gold Merovingian signet <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> the Christian symbol Ichthys was also discovered under many potsherds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{higher the}} {{operating}} speed, {{the more serious}} are problems with rotor stability. Three basic groups of rotors are analyzed and some methods of suppressing instability are shown. In the 1 st group are classical elastic rotors sup-ported in hydrodynamic bearings. Practically all high-speed rotors now run in tilt-ing pad bearings, which are inherently stable, but in specific conditions even tiling pad bearings may not ensure rotor stability. The 2 nd group is composed of combus-tion engines turbocharger rotors, which are characteristic by heavy impellers at both overhung ends of elastic shaft. These rotors are in most cases supported in floating <b>ring</b> <b>bearings,</b> which bring special features to rotor behaviour. The 3 rd group of rotors with gas bearings exhibits special features. Key words: high-speed rotors, sliding <b>bearings,</b> floating <b>ring</b> <b>bearings,</b> gas bear-ings, oil whip instability, oil whirl, pneumatic instability. ...|$|R

Officers and Members wear the badge from a ribbon on the left lapel (men) or a bow on the left shoulder (women).|$|E
40|$|The {{stability}} of a turbocharger rotor {{is governed by}} the coupling of rotor dynamics and fluid dynamics because the high speed rotor system is supported {{on a pair of}} hydrodynamic floating <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> which comprise of inner and outer fluid films in series. In order to investigate the stability, this paper has developed a finite element model of the rotor system with consideration of such exciting forces as rotor imbalance, hydrodynamic fluid forces, lubricant feed pressure and dead weight. The dimensionless analytical expression of nonlinear oil film forces in floating <b>ring</b> <b>bearings</b> have been derived on the basis of short bearing theory. Based on numerical simulation, the effects of rotor imbalance, lubricant viscosity, lubricant feed pressure and bearing clearances on the {{stability of}} turbocharger rotor system have been studied. The disciplines of the stability of two films and dynamic performances of rotor system have been provided...|$|R
40|$|Turbochargers {{are widely}} used in modern vehicle engines for {{boosting}} power, improving emission and increasing energy efficiency. Apart from the obvious benefit, the complexity of their nonlinear dynamic behaviours has to be encountered.

500|$|Carnarvon {{had been}} succeeded as Colonial Secretary by Sir Michael Hicks Beach, who {{received}} the deputation coldly. After Bok gave a lengthy opening declaration, Hicks Beach muttered: [...] "Have {{you ever heard of}} an instance where the British Lion has ever given up anything on which he had set his paw?" [...] Kruger retorted: [...] "Yes. The Orange Free State." [...] The deputation remained in London for some weeks thereafter, communicating by correspondence with Hicks Beach, who eventually reaffirmed Carnarvon's decision that the annexation would not be revoked. The deputation attempted to rally support for their cause, as the first mission had done, but with the Eastern Question dominating the political scene few were interested. One English sympathiser gave Kruger a gold <b>ring,</b> <b>bearing</b> the inscription: [...] "Take courage, your cause is just and must triumph in the end."

500|$|Several {{contemporary}} accounts {{focus on}} Mateiu's unusual preferences in clothing, {{pointing to a}} studied extravagance first adopted during his stay in Berlin, and in support {{of which he was}} reportedly spending more than he could afford. Literary historian George Călinescu recalled having seen a middle-aged Caragiale taking walks through downtown Bucharest: amused by the writer's everyday clothes, which he depicted as of an archaic fashion and slightly deteriorated, compared him to [...] "a butler on Sunday leave". Călinescu also told that, during winter, Caragiale would only touch metal with his hand while wearing suede gloves. Rosetti and poet Ștefana Velisar both recorded being amused by aspects of Caragiale's clothing, such as his oversized boots and his using scissors to cut out the worn out extremities of his trouser legs. In 1926, the writer began wearing a <b>ring</b> <b>bearing</b> the seal of Mercury, which, Vartic supposes, evidenced his trust in the psychopomp god's powers.|$|E
50|$|The screw has a multi-start thread. The rollers and {{encapsulating}} {{rotating ring}} are identically grooved, not threaded, {{so there is}} no axial movement between the two. The nut assembly includes a cylindrical housing capped by non-rotating spacer rings. The spacer rings have equidistant holes that act as rotary bearings for the smooth pivot ends (studs) of the rollers. Roller-type thrust bearings between the spacer <b>rings</b> and <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> permit free rotation of the <b>bearing</b> <b>ring</b> while transferring the axial load between the two.|$|R

2500|$|The Indo-Greek Menander I (reigned 155–130 BCE) {{drove the}} Greco-Bactrians out of Gandhara {{and beyond the}} Hindu Kush, {{becoming}} king shortly after his victory. His territories covered Panjshir and Kapisa in modern Afghanistan and extended to the Punjab region, with many tributaries {{to the south and}} east, possibly as far as Mathura. The capital Sagala (modern Sialkot) prospered greatly under Menander's rule and Menander {{is one of the few}} Bactrian kings mentioned by Greek authors. The classical Buddhist text Milinda Pañha praises Menander, saying there was [...] "none equal to Milinda in all India". His empire survived him in a fragmented manner until the last independent Greek king, Strato II, disappeared around 10 CE. Around 125 BCE, the Greco-Bactrian king Heliocles, son of Eucratides, fled from the Yuezhi invasion of Bactria and relocated to Gandhara, pushing the Indo-Greeks east of the Jhelum River. The last known Indo-Greek ruler was Theodamas, from the Bajaur area of Gandhara, mentioned on a 1st-century CE signet <b>ring,</b> <b>bearing</b> the Kharoṣṭhī inscription [...] "Su Theodamasa" [...] ("Su" [...] was the Greek transliteration of the Kushan royal title [...] "Shau" [...] ("Shah" [...] or [...] "King")).
