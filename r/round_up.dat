5|$|In {{the early}} years of conquest, encomienda rights {{effectively}} meant rights to pillage and <b>round</b> <b>up</b> slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and taken to a port to be sold, in order that the conquistadores could purchase weapons, supplies, and horses. In some cases the conquistadores would <b>round</b> <b>up</b> the elders, chain them up, whip them and set their war dogs upon them, in order to force the natives to hand over tribute such as food and clothing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{group of}} rides in Olde Idlewild is located around the park's Skooters, added in 1931. Surrounding the Skooters is the Balloon Race, Paratrooper, Ferris wheel, and Spider.

5|$|While the encomienda colonial labour-supply {{system was}} in the process of being established, slave raids became a part of the cycle of conquest. The Spanish would <b>round</b> <b>up</b> {{indigenous}} peoples, brand them as slaves, and trade them at ports on the Gulf of Mexico for horses and weaponry, allowing further conquest and the acquisition of new slaves for trade.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{now hold}} {{that there was}} likely no {{cross-pollination}} between the Revolt of the Lash and these subsequent revolts. The formerly mutinous Minas Geraes, {{under the command of}} João Cândido after the officers abandoned the ship, used a hidden-away gun (as the ship had otherwise been disarmed after the Revolt of the Lash) to fire on the marine infantry and demonstrate their loyalty. Even so, the government and navy, fueled by anger over their lost honor, used this opportunity to <b>round</b> <b>up</b> the remaining amnestied sailors and put them in prison.|$|E

5|$|Leonid Kinskey as Sascha, the Russian {{bartender}} {{infatuated with}} Yvonne. He {{was born into}} a Jewish family in Russia and had immigrated to the United States. He told Aljean Harmetz, author of <b>Round</b> <b>Up</b> the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca, that he was cast because he was Bogart's drinking buddy. He was not the first choice for the role; he replaced Leo Mostovoy, who was deemed not funny enough.|$|E

The intention was to eventually remove all the Jews from Poland, {{but at this point}} their final destination had not yet been determined. Together, the Wehrmacht and the Einsatzgruppen also drove tens of thousands of Jews eastward into Soviet-controlled territory.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to <b>round</b> <b>up</b> people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the highest bidder, typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|By 1528, Spanish {{colonial power}} had been {{established}} in the Chiapas Highlands, and encomienda rights were being issued to individual conquistadores. Spanish dominion extended from the upper drainage of the Grijalva, across Comitán and Teopisca to the Ocosingo valley. The north and northwest were incorporated into the Villa de Espíritu Santo district, that included Ch'ol Maya territory around Tila. In {{the early years of}} conquest, encomienda rights effectively meant rights to pillage and <b>round</b> <b>up</b> slaves, usually {{in the form of a}} group of mounted conquistadores launching a lightning slave raid upon an unsuspecting population centre. Prisoners would be branded as slaves, and were sold in exchange for weapons, supplies, and horses.|$|E
5|$|Guest {{joined up}} again, enlisting in Kitchener's Fighting Scouts on 2 January 1901. He {{was given the}} rank of Sergeant, chasing Boer commandoes without success. He was {{recommended}} for a commission and posted to the Johannesburg Mounted Rifles, whose Colonel decided that Guest {{was too young to}} lead a force composed of miners who were considerably older than him. Returning to Klerksdorp, Guest learned that the Bechuanaland Rifles were recruiting experienced officers; he went to Mafeking and was accepted into the unit, with whom he served {{until the end of the}} war. The Rifles were part of a mobile force, the Divisional Scouting Corps, whose function was to <b>round</b> <b>up</b> Boer detachments and to execute Kitchener's scorched earth policy, destroying Boer farm buildings and crops, and detaining women and children in concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|Manstein {{took part}} in a conference on 22 August 1939 where Hitler {{underlined}} to his commanders the need for the physical destruction of Poland as a nation. After the war, he would state in his memoirs that he did not recognise {{at the time of this}} meeting that Hitler was going to pursue a policy of extermination against the Poles. He did become aware of the policy later on, as he and other Wehrmacht generals received reports on the activities of the Einsatzgruppen, the Schutzstaffel (SS) death squads tasked with following the army into Poland to kill intellectuals and other civilians. These squads were also assigned to <b>round</b> <b>up</b> Jews and others for relocation to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps. Manstein later faced three charges of war crimes relating to Jewish and civilian deaths in the sectors under his control, and the mistreatment and deaths of prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|Springbok {{are mainly}} active around dawn and dusk. Activity is {{influenced}} by weather; springbok can feed at night in hot weather, and at midday in colder months. They rest {{in the shade of}} trees or bushes, and often bed down in the open when weather is cooler. The social structure of the springbok {{is similar to that of}} Thomson's gazelle. Mixed-sex herds or harems have a roughly 3:1 sex ratio; bachelor individuals are also observed. In the mating season, males generally form herds and wander in search of mates. Females live with their offspring in herds, that very rarely include dominant males. Territorial males <b>round</b> <b>up</b> female herds that enter their territories and keep out the bachelors; mothers and juveniles may gather in nursery herds separate from harem and bachelor herds. After weaning, female juveniles stay with their mothers until the birth of their next calves, while males join bachelor groups.|$|E
5|$|The smaller ghetto was {{liquidated}} in mid-October 1941, {{which left}} the larger one. From late October to December 1941, the ghetto {{was subject to}} Aktions, selections of people for deportation and execution in Ponary. Gens was afraid that {{the actions of the}} Germans would result in a widespread massacre. He persuaded the Gestapo to let the Jewish police <b>round</b> <b>up</b> the deportees. Gens, backed by the Jewish police force, was responsible for deciding who was to be sent for resettlement and execution. In October, this brought him into conflict with the ghetto's rabbis, who argued Gens was acting against Jewish law. Gens disagreed and considered it to be lawful to sacrifice some people to save others.|$|E

5|$|There {{are still}} working brewery horses in other areas, such as Wadworth Brewery's Shire horses in Devizes, Wiltshire, but working teams are {{becoming}} increasingly rare. In some areas, such as the New Forest, local farmers and commoners use horses to <b>round</b> <b>up</b> thousands of semi-feral ponies grazing on the open Forest during the drift season, and Britain's mounted police use horses in crowd control, but other than such niche areas, the horse in Britain today is kept almost entirely for recreational purposes. They compete in all equestrian disciplines, carry riders from novice to advanced on trekking and trail-riding holidays, work in riding schools, provide therapy for the disabled, and are much-loved companions and hacks. The horses and riders of Great Britain have won numerous medals for eventing in equestrian sports at the Summer Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of one Macedonian incursion, during which border guards are killed, Dumitriu is ordered to <b>round</b> <b>up</b> and execute {{a number of his}} Bulgarian prisoners. Horrified by this random reprisal, Marie-Thérèse strives to have them pardoned and released, but her plea only serves to irritate her husband's {{superiors}}. Her husband alienates his superiors further when he asks for the execution order to be ratified through official channels, whereas they would prefer an extrajudicial killing. The resulting toll on Dumitriu's career means that they are forced to leave Southern Dobruja, shortly before which the captain's colleagues make public their resentment of the couple. The captain feels dishonored when an angry General Tchilibia draws a comparison between Von Debretsy and the prostitute Erzsi and stresses that, as Hungarians, both women are natural suspects in Romania. It is {{a result of}} this that Dumitriu decides to commit suicide, unable to decide whether to shoot himself in the mouth or in the temple, and ultimately falling of the stool (which his mare had chewed on) and weeping uncontrollably. This episode, Simon points out, was not present in the original text, and was invented by Pintilie to underline the degradation his character undergoes in order to survive. In what is one of the closing scenes, Marie-Thérèse is stoned by those Bulgarian women whose husbands had been executed.|$|E

After defeating the police and rescuing Original Cindy, Max goes to meet her friend and ally, cyber-journalist Logan Cale at his apartment. Outside the apartment complex she defeats an I Corporation genetically engineered boss character named Beetle. Meanwhile, a cloaked figure murders a police officer at the scene and steals his vehicle. Logan informs Max that he has received an email from someone named Sylan who claims that Max has a twin sister. He traces the email to an I Corporation research lab named Tritech. Max tells Logan that Sylan was one of the child soldiers at Manticore, and that she stayed behind in order to help Max and eleven of her siblings escape. Max proceeds to Tritech to find her.|$|E
