5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III.

He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the inevitability of institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for <b>regulatory</b> <b>reform</b> that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, China has {{experienced}} a series of <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> in its electricity industry, aimed at improving power production efficiency. The central planning system was broken up and the market-oriented modern enterprise system was established. Furthermore, the former vertically integrated electricity utilities were divested and the generation sector was separated from the transmission and distribution networks. In this paper, we intend to estimate the impact of <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> on production efficiency of fossil-fired generation plants using the plant-level national survey data collected in 1995 and 2004. Applying the econometric method of Differences-in-Differences, we estimate {{the effects of these}} reforms on the demand for inputs of employees, fuel and nonfuel materials. The results show that the net efficiency improvement in labor input associated with the <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> is roughly 29 % and the gains in nonfuel materials are about 35 %, while {{there is no evidence of}} efficiency gains in fuel input associated with the electricity reforms.

40|$|In 1994, the Italian Parliament {{passed a}} reform which aimed to radically change the {{economic}} regulatory {{institutions of the}} water sector in the country. The implementation of the reform, which lasted about twelve years, resulted in a new regulatory regime which combined selected features of public ownership, franchise allocation, and discretionary regulation. The reform was implemented in different ways across the country, resulting in different forms of organisation {{and management of the}} water services at the local level. Drawing from this case, this paper aims to discuss two issues, namely why water <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> are design as 'hybrids' between different regulatory 'models' and why, within a given regulatory institutional framework, water <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> may be implemented in different ways at the local level. This paper, therefore, aims to contribute to a broader scholarly discussion regarding the rationales for institutional variety of water infrastructure regulation at the national and sub-national levels and the practical implications for managing the implementation of water <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} effects of <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> on {{logistics}} and analyzes logistics outsourcing (LO) as one form of logistics innovation. The analysis of {{the effects of}} <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> focuses on the trucking industry, which has the highest share of domestic freight transport in Japan. The results show that, compared with other transport industries and the industry as a whole, total factor productivity (TFP) for the trucking industry increased noticeably following <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms.</b> The results of the analysis of LO reveal that outsourcing success depends on the outsourcee's management involvement in LO, the establishment of information-sharing relationships, and the retention of core logistics-related operational capabilities (logistics competence). Further, efficient LO has a positive direct impact on cost competitiveness, while indirect LO contributions, which work through changes in the company's internal business structure, {{have a positive impact on}} inventory reductions. Future research might show even stronger indirect contributions of LO to corporate operations by means of efficient information sharing and collaborative improvement of business structures. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{period of}} the global {{financial}} crisis followed by the sovereign debt crisis represents the strongest period of recession in Europe since the Great Depression in 1929. The response by regulators and politics were extensive <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> that influence the banking sector massively. This thesis has the purpose to describe how banking sector stability can be defined, why regulation is necessary in the banking sector and {{to shed light on}} the complicated system of the resulting regulatory institutions in Europe by means of a qualitative literature research. In addition, this thesis evaluates the effectiveness of the current <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> and the current state of banking sector stability {{on the basis of a}} quantitative analysis of risk indicators with respect to the newly introduced regulations.

40|$|South Korea proclaimed {{a gradual}} {{economic}} liberalization {{ever since the}} early 1980 s. Regardless of her vow to do so, however, most of liberalization efforts {{turned out to be}} a sheer rhetoric. In sharp contrast, genuine market liberalization and <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> are being introduced in the telecommunication sector, which is unprecedented in the Korean economic history. Why and how could Korea pursue such a full scale market liberalization and <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms</b> in the telecommunications sector? Though it is argued that a regulatory convergence in economic management is found in everywhere in the world, the particular speed, scope, and/or processes of a country's telecommunication reform cannot be understood correctly without examining the structures and institutions of the Korean political economy and of the telecommunications industry. This paper examines the causes and consequences of the Korean telecommunication reform by analyzing the relevant institutional changes both in domestic and international, which largely affect the interaction among those involved in the process of market liberalization and <b>regulatory</b> <b>reforms.</b> ...|$|R
