40|$|Continuous caster moulds are {{the last}} and most {{important}} stage in the steelmaking process, where inclusions can either be generated or removed. With increasing casting speed using conventional immersion nozzles critical problems, such as unstable bulk mould flow have been noticed. Mould flux entrapment due to vortex and shearing action from the oscillating surface waves have become of particular concern. It is therefore necessary to have a calm inlet flow {{at the entrance of}} the mould. Recently, it has been acknowledged that a swirl blade placed at the upstream of the immersion nozzle effectively resolves the problems arising from unstable bulk mould flow. Therefore, to increase the knowledge of effect of swirling flow on the flow pattern in the mould, fundamental mathematical models of a billet mould equipped with a swirl blade in the nozzle have been developed. The model was used to study the effect of divergent angle of the immersion nozzle and mould aspect ratio on the flow field and temperature distribution inside billets moulds. Data from water model experiments were used to verify the mathematical model predictions. A fairly good agreement was found between physical modeling data and predictions, which ensured that the numerical model is reliable. Thereafter, the differences between square and round billet moulds were studied. Next, the effect of changing aspect ratio of the rectangular mould on the fluid flow and heat transfer, while keeping mould surface area constant, was studied. Two types of immersion nozzles, bottomless and conventional, were also analyzed during the research. The model moulds were changed gradually from a square billet with an aspect ratio of 1 x 1 to a <b>rectangular</b> <b>billet</b> with an aspect ratio of 3 x 1. First, the temperature and velocity distributions were calculated. Later, unsteady calculations were done to determine velocity fluctuations on the meniscus level for two types of nozzles and several moulds geometries. QC 20101110 </p...|$|E

40|$|Metal forming {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} {{materials}} processing techniques which are still playing important roles in modem life. In metal forming, as in any other manufacturing processes, the ultimate goal is to produce components of a selected material with a required geometrical shape and a structure optimised for the proposed service environment. Of the above production of the desired shape is a major part of the manufacturing process. Extrusion forging is a metal forming process in which the billet is partially undergoing extrusion, thus forming a boss, and partially deformed laterally. The understanding of the metal flow and the prediction of forging load in such a process is important both for the die design and the product quality control. Due to the complexity in deformation pattern and the inherent unsteadiness of the operation, it is at present very difficult to obtain a satisfactory analytical solution. In this work, an approximate analysis has been carried out by assuming that the deformation will go through three distinctive modes, and an over-estimation solution has subsequently been formed. Numerical analysis has been performed using a commercial finite element analysis package. The plane strain extrusion forging of <b>rectangular</b> <b>billets</b> has been simulated using 8 -noded elements. Results of deformation profile and forging load are obtained. Experimental work has been carried out by deforming <b>rectangular</b> <b>billets</b> between two dies, with at least one of them grooved. The effect of material property, forming speed and the lubricating condition at the die-billet interface has been studied experimentally, by applying different billet materials, different forming speeds and different lubricants at the die/billet interfaces. The analytical approach is capable of predicting the deformed profiles as well as the forging loads for certain die combinations, while for others the result is only valid within about 50 % of axial deformation. The results from the finite element analysis give excellent correlation with the experimental results. From the analytical, numerical and the experimental studies it has been found that the plane strain extrusion forging of <b>rectangular</b> <b>billets</b> between grooved dies takes place with significant inward barrelling. The deformed profile depends mainly on the relative geometry of the die/billet combination, which is characterized by the ratio of the groove width to billet width, and the cross-section aspect ratio of the billet. The material properties of the billet material have been found having little effect on the deformation patterns, though the forging load varied because of the change in the yield stress. The interfacial friction has been noted affecting the forging load as well as the deformed profiles. The effect of the forming speed is mainly on the forging load rather than the deformation geometry. The present study provides a better understanding of the plane strain extrusion forging process, which is similar to the initial stages of closed the die forging. The results of the study can be applied to the product quality control and tool design in such metal forming operations...|$|R
