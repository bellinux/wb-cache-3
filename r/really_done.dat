This presented an opportunity for Mulder to confront his partner {{with the fact that}} he is normally right, resulting in a response from Scully, affirming the fact.|$|E

500|$|Piller {{described}} {{the addition of}} Ro to the cast as one of that season's biggest accomplishments, and was pleased that it was well received. He added that in [...] "Ensign Ro", they made a deliberate decision to have Ro embraced by Guinan {{in order to ensure}} that the fans warmed to the new addition. Piller felt that when Guinan took Ro to meet Captain Jean-Luc Picard in that episode, the character was effectively presenting Ro to the fans of the series and endorsing her. During the writing process, he felt that once he came across the friendship between Guinan and Ro that he believed [...] "we had <b>really</b> <b>done</b> something magnificent".

500|$|Carabott felt Charlotte's death {{could have}} been {{explored}} further, but as {{there was so much}} happening in the episode not enough time was made for her death. Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger noted it was Jeremy Davies portrayal of Faraday's grief that made him care about her death. Cynthia Littleton from Variety said {{this was one of the}} few times Charlotte did not annoy her, as she acts as a translator for Jin, [...] "finally do something worthwhile". Noel Murray of The A.V. Club felt distracted by Charlotte in this episode, because her reaction to time travel was different from what was shown in [...] "The Constant", and found it [...] "incredibly awkward" [...] when Charlotte explained her whole backstory to Faraday. TV Guides Mickey O'Connor praised Mader's acting, saying [...] "Well done, Rebecca Mader, who has <b>really</b> <b>done</b> some fine work on Lost".|$|E
500|$|Odyssey Number Five marked Powderfinger's first {{successful}} attempt {{to enter the}} United States market. Fanning told Billboard in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, [...] "In America, we haven't <b>really</b> <b>done</b> any work yet to deserve any major popularity", with the [...] "vibes" [...] on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream. Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As {{a result of these}} efforts, [...] "My Happiness" [...] was briefly placed on rotation on KROQ-FM and several other radio stations. The song ultimately peaked at #23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. This success was assisted by the band appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman, and by supporting Coldplay on tour. Guitarist Darren Middleton summarised their work in the United States by stating [...] "This year has been a bit of a blur." ...|$|E
500|$|Writer Steven Moffat {{described}} the premise as the traditional 'Doctor Who' thing of taking something omnipresent {{in your life}} and making it sinister, if something did get in the Wi-Fi, we'd be kind of screwed. Nobody had <b>really</b> <b>done</b> it before, so I thought, 'It's time to get kids frightened of Wi-Fi!' [...] However, he denied that his intention was to give a warning about technology, but rather tell an adventure story about a [...] "new way [...] to invade" [...] based on something viewers were familiar with. Producer Marus Wilson suggested that the episode be an [...] "urban thriller", as the story would already be set in contemporary London to introduce Clara and the Wi-Fi monsters. Moffat compared the style to James Bond and The Bourne Identity. Moffat said that the episode was [...] "an action roller coaster" [...] rather than a story intended to be scary.|$|E

500|$|Noel Murray, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, graded the two-part premiere an 'A-', praising it as [...] "retro-cool pulp thrills in fabulous outfits. Think The Rocketeer or Raiders of the Lost Ark, {{but with a}} dame instead of a dude." [...] In his conclusion, Murray stated that [...] "'s {{greatest}} asset is Atwell, who takes a character that Marvel Comics has never <b>really</b> <b>done</b> much with before and makes it her own." [...] Oliver Sava, also from The A.V. Club, graded [...] "Now is Not the End" [...] an 'A-' as well, calling the series a gamble, but deciding that the first episode [...] "surpasses expectations with its dynamic direction and fight choreography, clever writing, and hugely charismatic lead." [...] Apart from Atwell's performance, which he called [...] "confident, strong, and sassy", Sava was also positive about the involvements of D'Esposito, Markus, and McFeely, and overall he found the episode, along with the next one, to be superior to Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Ahsan Haque of IGN said that [...] "Family Guy has never <b>really</b> <b>done</b> anything particularly special {{for the last}} episode of any season [...] and despite the obvious efforts to increase the animation quality and try to tell a complete story in this episode, it didn't {{turn out to be}} the winning effort that will keep fans eagerly awaiting the show's return next season". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a D, and called it an [...] "unfortunate and unfunny flashback [...] with lots of incest gags [...] was genuinely queasy-making, but not in a way that made anyone laugh from the shock of recognition or anything like that", but said that Family Guy can be [...] "damn funny when it wants to be", referring to the Fox promos that take up the bottom quarter of the screen. Robin Pierson of The TV Critic gave the episode a positive review, stating: [...] "Good fun story, good fun jokes", but said that the end [...] "felt flat" [...] because of the Revenge of the Nerds music sequence.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never <b>really</b> <b>done</b> anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E

500|$|The {{pilot was}} shot in April 1995 and {{directed}} by Michael Lessac. Although set in Cleveland, the show was actually filmed at the Warner Bros. Television studios in Burbank, California. Helford had noticed that the cast {{did not look at}} each other while saying their lines and he tried to encourage them to look at one another, so they would laugh. Helford told Lessac to bring the cast in on a weekend, where there was no pressure, so they could [...] "goof around" [...] and relax. Drew's job required him to work from a cubicle and Helford stated that no one had <b>really</b> <b>done</b> a show dealing with that situation, as producers and networks felt it was too confined. Helford disagreed and had a set where an accessible cubicle was the centerpiece designed and built. The Memphis Plaza Lounge in Old Brooklyn was the inspiration for the show's bar The Warsaw Tavern. The owner of the Lounge refused to sell the naming rights to Warner Bros, but he did agree that they could film the front of the building. The crew shot the building in 1995 and temporarily replaced The Memphis Plaza Lounge sign with their own Warsaw Tavern one. The sign was hung in the front window for two years before Warner Bros. took it down.|$|E
500|$|Referring to [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic", Skaff {{said that}} the song's title—a {{reference}} to Tails and Sonic from the video game series—had [...] "really came out of nowhere."

[...] Both [...] "You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic" [...] and [...] "Out of Time" [...] talk about [...] "how I feel like I'm doing what I want with my life, but I think, [...] "Wow, I just did something that really affected me."" [...] "Out of Time" [...] {{was also one of}} the first songs written for the album, and was written while the band was in Australia. McKinnon said the song was the most personal on the record. Skaff had a major hand in writing [...] "If I Leave". The song describes [...] "different things you got through being on the road" [...] and [...] "a relationship ending when you're not really around enough to actually take care of it in person." [...] On being asked whether he knew it would be the final song on the album, McKinnon said [...] "It just felt right [...] seemed like a good ending".|$|E
500|$|Nichols {{had done}} {{commercial}} work {{and had a}} bit part as a model in the romantic drama film Autumn in New York (2000) when her modeling agent helped her get a one-episode role in the fourth season of Sex and the City (2002). She later said she had [...] "never <b>really</b> <b>done</b> a proper audition before", and added that [...] "I had such fun , that day actually {{made me want to}} pursue [...] more seriously." [...] Later that year she was cast in her first major film role as Jessica, a dogged student newspaper reporter, in [...] (2003). Although the film was panned by critics, making it was a learning experience for Nichols. She said, [...] "I was a sponge for the entire time I was in Atlanta [...] and freely admitted that I {{had no idea what was}} going on. I had never done a big film before, I had never been the lead in a film before and any advice anyone wanted to give me, I was more than willing to take." [...] The following year, Nichols played a member of a high school debate team in the independent film Debating Robert Lee (2004) and had a two-episode role in the crime drama television series Line of Fire (2004), which was cancelled after 11 of 13 produced episodes were broadcast. By August 2004, she was cast in supporting roles in the horror films The Amityville Horror (2005) and The Woods (2006).|$|E

500|$|After the {{commercial}} lackluster of her eighth studio album, Britney Jean (2013), Spears started her Las Vegas residency show, , which attained commercial success. Later, in September 2014, the singer posted {{a picture of}} herself in a recording studio, hinting that she was recording new music. In an interview with Extra, a month later, she revealed that she was working [...] "very slowly, but progressively" [...] on a studio album. She also released the song [...] "Pretty Girls" [...] in 2015 with Iggy Azalea, which was met with moderate impact. This resulted in Spears {{heading back to the}} studio to record more songs without having plans to release a new album. In late 2016, during interviews to promote Glory, Spears declared that she wanted to explore new things on the record, and that it was her [...] "most hip-hop album," [...] explaining, [...] " [...] there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time now, and I just haven't <b>really</b> <b>done</b> that." [...] Talay Riley, who was among the songwriters that worked with Spears on the album, previously co-wrote Iggy Azalea's [...] "Bounce" [...] (2013) and Nick Jonas' [...] "Levels" [...] (2015). After the release of first single [...] "Make Me..." [...] and the promotional single [...] "Private Show" [...] on August 8, 2016, Spears and website PopCrush announced that [...] "Clumsy" [...] was going to be made available as the second promotional track from the Glory as an instant grant for those who pre-ordered the album.

500|$|Paramount CEO Sherry Lansing revived studio {{interest}} in 1998. Schroeder, who shepherded Tim Burton's Edward Scissorhands as a studio executive at 20th Century Fox in 1990, suggested that Burton direct the film. Francis Ford Coppola's minimal production duties came from American Zoetrope; Burton only {{became aware of}} Coppola's involvement during the editing process when he was sent a copy of Sleepy Hollows trailer and saw Coppola's name on it. Burton, coming off the troubled production of Superman Lives, was hired to direct in June 1998. [...] "I had never <b>really</b> <b>done</b> something that {{was more of a}} horror film," [...] he explained, [...] "and it's funny, because {{those are the kind of}} movies that I like probably more than any other genre." [...] His {{interest in}} directing a horror film influenced by his love for Hammer Film Productions and Black Sunday—particularly the supernatural feel they evoked as a result of being filmed primarily on sound stages. As a result, Sleepy Hollow is a homage to various Hammer Film Productions, including Dr. Jekyll and Sister Hyde, and other films such as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein, various Roger Corman horror films, Jason and the Argonauts, and Scream Blacula Scream. The image of the Headless Horseman had fascinated Burton during his apprenticeship as a Disney animator at CalArts in the early 1980s. [...] "One of my teachers had worked on the Disney version as one of the layout artists on the chase, and he brought in some layouts from it, so that was exciting. It was one of the things that maybe shaped what I like to do." [...] Burton worked with Walker on rewrites, but Rudin suggested that Tom Stoppard rewrite the script to add to the comical aspects of Ichabod's bumbling mannerisms, and emphasize the character's romance with Katrina. His work went uncredited through the WGA screenwriting credit system.|$|E
500|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of the first season of [...] on Fox, Warner Bros. {{assigned}} Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered [...] "too brainy", as it required Batman to be inmobile during a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode [...] "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he [...] "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had <b>really</b> <b>done</b> it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head." [...] In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, Paul Dini stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, but writer Michael Reaves said, [...] "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story {{in a way that we}} never could in live-action." [...] In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent Animated Series writer Paul Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously [...] used in the episodes [...] "Joker's Wild" [...] and [...] "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".|$|E
