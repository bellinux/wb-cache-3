5|$|The cool, damp habitat {{provided}} by the bogs at Black Moshannon State Park provides a home for some birds {{that are at the}} southern limit of their habitat in central Pennsylvania. The Canada warbler and northern waterthrush nest in the bogs, as do the alder flycatcher, common yellowthroat, swamp sparrow, <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbird,</b> and gray catbird. The olive-sided flycatcher, which is designated as locally extinct in Pennsylvania, has been seen during the breeding season at Black Moshannon State Natural Area. Bird watchers have observed nesting barred owls in the IBA, as well as Virginia rail and sora.|$|E
5|$|The American robin (Turdus migratorius) is a migratory {{songbird}} of the thrush family. It {{is named}} after the European robin because of its reddish-orange breast, though the two species are not closely related, with the European robin belonging to the Old World flycatcher family. The American robin is widely distributed throughout North America, wintering from southern Canada to central Mexico and along the Pacific Coast. It is the state bird of Connecticut, Michigan, and Wisconsin. According to some sources, the American robin ranks behind only the <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbird</b> (and {{just ahead of the}} introduced European starling and the not-always-naturally-occurring house finch) as the most abundant extant land bird in North America. It has seven subspecies, but only T. m. confinis of Baja California Sur is particularly distinctive, with pale gray-brown underparts.|$|E

5|$|Of the 127 {{bird species}} found along the Merced River, only 35 occur {{along the entire}} length of the river. Many of these birds are migratory and only pass the area a few times every year, while 109 species of birds are found only in the {{breeding}} season. Birds are more abundant along the slow-moving lower river, which has more suitable riparian habitat compared to the rocky, swift upper river. Common species of bird throughout the basin include ruby-crowned kinglet, cedar waxwing, American robin, yellow-rumped warbler, tree swallow and European starling, and several endangered species, including white-tailed kite and Swainson's hawk. Birds that occur commonly in the middle and upper sections of the Merced River include mourning dove, Cassin's finch, California quail, dark-eyed junco, woodpecker, dipper, great blue heron, scrub jay, <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbird,</b> red-tailed hawk, turkey vulture, cliff swallow, canyon wren, merganser, and bald eagles. Common insects found along the river include mayflies, stoneflies and caddisflies. The river is impacted by invasive Asiatic clam, Chinese mitten crab, and New Zealand mud snail.|$|E

500|$|The icterid {{family of}} the New World is {{sometimes}} called the blackbird family because of some species' superficial resemblance to the common blackbird and other Old World thrushes, {{but they are not}} evolutionarily close, being related to the New World warblers and tanagers. The term is often limited to smaller species with mostly or entirely black plumage, at least in the breeding male, notably the cowbirds, the grackles, and for around 20 species with [...] "blackbird" [...] in the name, such as the <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbird</b> and the melodious blackbird.|$|E

40|$|Wildlife repellents {{provide a}} {{non-lethal}} alternative for managing agricultural impacts associated with wildlife depredation. To evaluate a potential bird repellent for ripening corn, {{we conducted a}} feeding experiment at the United States Department of Agriculture, National Wildlife Research Center with 66 <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> (Agelaius phoeniceus). Using a two-choice experimental design we tested the efficacy of Avipel repellent (a. i. 50 % 9, 10 -anthraquinone) on ripening sweet corn. <b>Red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> consumed an average of 8. 6 % ± 0. 9 % of kernels from untreated ears and 5. 3 % ± 1. 1 % from ears treated with anthraquinone. The interaction between anthraquinone concentration and corn treatment suggests a positive concentration-response for <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds.</b> Odds ratio analysis suggests <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> were 1. 4 {{times more likely to}} damage untreated sweet corn compared to treated sweet corn. These results suggest efficacy of anthraquinone-based products as red-wing blackbird repellents for ripening corn. Moreover, exposure to anthraquinone-based repellents may reduce consumption of a food matrix that receives little to no direct anthraquinone exposure. Supplemental research is recommended to evaluate anthraquinone-based repellents under field conditions, including the establishment of a chemical tolerance for food and feed use...|$|R

40|$|Male <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> (Agelaius phoeniceus) often {{cooperate}} with their neighbours in defending nests against predators. Some {{studies have suggested}} that {{this is an example of}} by-product mutualism, whereas others have suggested the possibility of reciprocal altruism. No study has addressed the possibility of kin-selected cooperation in nest defence in this species. Reciprocal altruism, kin selection and by-product mutualism are not mutually exclusive alternatives, but few studies of territorial neighbours have tested for multiple mechanisms simultaneously. We test for these three possibilities in a population of <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds.</b> We used simulated defections to test for reciprocal altruism. We used analysis of microsatellite loci to test for kin selection between adult male neighbours. We also used microsatellite loci to test for by-product mutualism resulting from nest defence of offspring sired on neighbouring territories. We found that male <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> cooperate in nest defence primarily as a form of reciprocal altruism. Experimental males reduced their level of nest defence relative to controls following simulated defection by a neighbour. In contrast to some earlier studies, we found no evidence for by-product mutualism: males did not defend nests where they had sired extra-pair offspring. We also found no evidence for kin selection: males were no more cooperative with more closely related neighbours. Considered alongside the results from other studies, our study suggests that mechanisms stabilizing cooperation in <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> may vary among populations...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> that {{breed in}} the {{northern}} part of their range, i.e., Canada and border states in the United States, migrate south for the winter. However, populations near the Pacific and Gulf coasts of North America and those of Middle America are year-round resident. <b>Red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> live in both Northern U.S. and Canada, ranging from Yucatan Peninsula in the south to the southern part of Alaska. These extensions account for the majority of the continent stretching from California’s Pacific coast and Canada to the eastern seaboard. Much of the populations within Middle America are non-migratory [...] During the fall, populations begin migrating towards Southern U.S. Movement of <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> can begin as early as August through October. Spring migration begins anywhere between mid-February to mid-May. Numerous birds from northern parts of the U.S., particularly the Great lakes, migrate nearly 1,200 km between their breeding season and winter [...] Winter territorial areas differ based on geographic location [...] Other populations that migrate year-round include those located in Middle America or in the western U.S. and Gulf Coast. Females typically migrate longer distances than males. These female populations located near the Great Lakes migrate nearly 230 km farther. Yearly-traveled females also migrate further than adult males, while also moving roughly the same distance as other adult females. <b>Red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> migrate primarily during daytime. In general, males’ migration flocks arrive prior to females in the spring and after females in the fall.|$|R

40|$|For {{the past}} three years the New Jersey Department of Agriculture, in coop¬eration with the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, has {{conducted}} field evaluations on the effects of reproductive suppressants on wild populations of <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds.</b> These studies have been performed in conjunction with the North East 49 (a Federally sponsored regional project which presently has nine states in the North East and Ohio cooperating to develop means to combat bird damage to agricultural crops) regional project on control of bird depredations. Field evaluations in 1968 and 1969 centered around the effects of TEM (tri-ethylene melamine) on the reproductive rates of <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds.</b> At the close of the 1969 season further field testing of the chemical was discontinued because of the material 2 ̆ 7 s apparent lack of effectiveness as a reproductive inhibitor.

In response, wildlife managers have considered local population reduction as a strategy for reducing <b>blackbird</b> damage. Male <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> are logistically easier to remove than females because of their conspicuous behavior. However, they exhibit a polygynous breeding system, and male removals may be ineffective if a large population of floaters exists to replace removed birds.

40|$|In late summer, <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> forage {{heavily on}} {{ripening}} sunflower crops in the Dakotas. Sunflower achenes have a distinct fatty acid profile that should influence the fatty acid composition in tissues of these buds. To determine if fatty acid composition in tissue {{could be used}} as a biomarker indicating dietary history, we fed 18 <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> a sunflower diet for 2 weeks and compared fatty acid profiles in their muscle and liver tissues to a control group of <b>red-winged</b> <b>blackbirds</b> (n = 15) fed a birdseed mix supplemented with safflower seed. Three subjects from each treatment group were sacrificed at Day 0, 7, 14, and 21, with Day 0 the day the treated group was switched to sunflower. The remaining buds were sacrificed on Day 35. Breast muscle and liver tissue were collected, extracted, and analyzed for levels of linoleic, oleic, palmitic, and stearic acids. Differences existed in levels of all 4 fatty acids between treatment groups pooled across time (P ≤ 0. 05, ANOVA). When comparing fatty acid profiles between treated and controls by day sacrificed, we observed differences in levels of ≥ 1 of the fatty acids at Day 7, 14, and 21 in breast muscle, and Day 7 and 14 in liver tissue (P ≤ 0. 05, t-test). Within-bird comparisons of fatty acid levels in liver and breast indicated temporal lags in metabolism between tissue types (P ≤ 0. 05, paired t-test).
