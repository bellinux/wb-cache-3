5|$|The video {{begins in}} its {{principal}} setting with Swift and two backup musicians atop {{a stage in}} a crowded barn. Swift {{is dressed in a}} fitted pastel sundress and plays an acoustic guitar strapped over her shoulder. The backup musicians play the fiddle,the piano, the drum set, and the upright bass. The video then transitions to a clip from Hannah Montana: The Movie in which Miley Stewart (Cyrus) spots her love interest, Travis Brody (Lucas Till), riding a brown horse. The video alternates between Swift performing and more film clips. Other scenes include Stewart and Brody riding the brown horse together, Stewart staring out from a red car into the street, Brody swinging from a <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> a waterfall, and the two characters on a date. At the end of the video, the couple are slow dancing while Swift sings.|$|E
5|$|At Royal Rumble on January 23, 2000, The Rock {{entered the}} Royal Rumble match {{and was one}} of the final two remaining, along with Big Show; Show {{seemingly}} intended to throw The Rock over the top <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> a running powerslam-like position, but Rock countered the move on the ring apron, sending Big Show to the floor before re-entering the ring as the winner. However, The Rock's feet hit the floor first, although those watching the event on TV did not see that, until Big Show proved this with additional video footage, and claimed to be the rightful winner. Despite this proof, the original decision could not be reversed, so a number one contender's match for the WWF Championship was held at No Way Out, which Big Show won after Shane McMahon interfered and hit The Rock in the head with a steel chair as he attempted to execute a People's Elbow. The Rock defeated Big Show on March 13 episode of Raw Is War to regain the right to face the WWF Champion, Triple H, at WrestleMania 2000 in a fatal four-way elimination match, also including Big Show and Mick Foley. Each wrestler had a McMahon in his corner: Triple H had his wife, Stephanie, Foley had Linda, The Rock had Vince and Big Show had Shane. Triple H retained the title after Vince betrayed The Rock by hitting him with a chair.|$|E
5|$|The {{participation}} {{of these two}} annual ceremonies are considered the least time-consuming part of the herald's roles. However at other times {{they are involved in}} some of the most important ceremonies concerning the life of the British monarch. After the death of a Sovereign the Accession Council (made up of Privy Councillors and other officers such as the Lord Mayor of London) meets at St. James's Palace to make a formal proclamation of the accession of the next Sovereign. The traditional method of publishing the council's proclamation recognising the new monarch is by way of it being physically read out. This task is assigned to the various members of the College by way of the Earl Marshal, who receives the text of the proclamation from the council in person. The proclamation is to be read at several locations in London. Traditionally the first reading is made from the Friary Court balcony at St James's Palace. Another reading and ceremony is held at the Temple Bar. There a detachment of heralds, accompanied by troops of the Royal Horse Guards, formally demand admission to the precinct of the City of London from the City Marshall and City remembrancer. The barrier, consisting of a silken <b>rope</b> (<b>in</b> place of the ancient bar) was then removed and the detachment would march forward to meet the Lord Mayor and City Sheriffs, where the proclamation would be read. Other readings by members of the College also occur at the corner of Chancery Lane, in Fleet Street, and at the Royal Exchange.|$|E

25|$|In {{the case}} of an object that is {{swinging}} around {{on the end of a}} <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> a horizontal plane, the centripetal force on the object is supplied by the tension of the rope. The rope example is an example involving a 'pull' force. The centripetal force can also be supplied as a 'push' force, such as in the case where the normal reaction of a wall supplies the centripetal force for a wall of death rider.|$|E
25|$|It was {{the second}} time {{in less than a week}} that a Cirque show on the Strip was halted for an {{accident}} involving one of its artists; a performer in one of the final preview performances of Michael Jackson One at Mandalay Bay suffered a mild concussion after slipping through the slack <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> the show’s “Stranger in Moscow” scene, missing the protective pad below the act and landing hard upon the stage.

Hodge had actually completed the catch cleanly, before running over to the crowd to celebrate. Hodge denied the accusation and considered taking legal action. Cork was sanctioned by the ECB.|$|E
25|$|Rotation at La Vielle {{always took}} place the same way: The vedette {{approaches}} {{as close to}} the rocks as possible, amid the roar and swell of the waves. Once close, the crew secured the rope launched by the keepers. The rope was used to ferry a passenger back and forth. Once the passenger had secured his safety belt, he sat down with his luggage astride a kind of large ball that slid up or down the <b>rope.</b> <b>In</b> stormy weather the manoeuvre was particularly delicate and difficult; in fierce gales it was often impossible.|$|E

The sixth soldier also appears to be pushing the cross down to add to the weight.|$|E

25|$|Edinburgh’s first trams were horse-drawn; {{they began}} {{operation}} on 6 November 1871, and ran between Haymarket and Leith. The following year saw {{the establishment of}} the circle route, which ran via Marchmont and Church Hill to the West End of Princes Street; the fare was one penny, or two pence for a return. In 1881 and 1882 steam engine hauled trams were tried out at Portobello, but they were unsuccessful. From 1888 cable operated trams were introduced: they were hauled by a wire <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> a conduit under the road surface. By {{the turn of the twentieth}} century, Edinburgh’s cable car system had increased to include 200 cars, servicing 25 route-miles of track.|$|E
25|$|After {{five days}} of {{climbing}} on a vertical rock offering very limited protection, Bonatti found himself stalled and faced with an impassable overhanging section. On the left and on the right the rock was absolutely smooth. Bonatti put together all the slings and small sections of ropes he had on him, attached {{one end of the}} <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> a crack and swinging on the other end managed to negotiate the difficulty. This route, known afterwards as the Bonatti Pillar, is considered still today {{as one of the greatest}} achievements in alpinism. In order to overcome long vertical sections and several overhangs, Bonatti had to adapt the techniques of aid climbing to the granitic rock formations of the Dru.|$|E
25|$|The {{transport}} then {{approaches a}} dark area and stops. Indiana Jones suddenly appears above the vehicle {{hanging on a}} <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> a shaft of light. He welcomes the adventurers' rescue and bids them {{to turn on the}} headlights and prepare for him to board. As the lights flicker on, they illuminate a massive boulder rolling toward the transport. The transport seems to back up as the boulder threatens to crush Jones and the tourists. At the last possible second, the transport accelerates and suddenly the floor seems to give way, sending the transport into the chamber below. An impact resonates through the chamber, as if the boulder has crashed down, nearly striking the transport.|$|E

25|$|The Pittsburg Pirates {{moved to}} Exposition Park the {{following}} season. On April 24, 1891, Fred Carroll hit the first home {{run by a}} Pirate in the stadium. Under the management of Fred Clarke the Pirates won the National League pennant in 1901, 1902, and 1903. After the 1903 season, Dreyfuss and Boston Americans owner Henry Killilea organized a best of nine game series to match the two pennant winners against each other. The first World Series held three games in Boston before moving to Exposition Park with the Pirates leading the series 2–1. On October 6, 1903, 7,600people attended the first World Series game in a National League stadium—the Pirates won by one run. The following day 12,000people attended the game, forcing some spectators to stand behind a <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> the outfield. The Pirates lost three of four games at Exposition Park and eventually the Series.|$|E
25|$|After {{leaving the}} service, Hogan {{returned}} to the film industry, {{but only for a}} short time. In 1947 he appeared in a featured role in Blaze of Noon, starring Anne Baxter and William Holden. In 1948 he was featured in two more films: Beyond Glory, starring Alan Ladd and Donna Reed; and Shed No Tears, starring Wallace Ford and June Vincent. Even though it was the first film he worked on in 1948, his final on-screen performance was in Alfred Hitchcock's <b>Rope.</b> <b>In</b> it, Hogan played the crucial role of David Kentley, the erstwhile friend who is strangled {{at the beginning of the}} picture and whose body is hidden in a chest while the murderers' guests have dinner in the same room. Hogan's final acting appearance was on the Broadway stage, in the unsuccessful comedy, Time for Elizabeth, which ran for only 8 performances at the Fulton Theatre in September–October 1948.|$|E
25|$|This {{apparatus}} {{may be made}} of hemp or {{a synthetic}} material which retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness. Its length is {{in proportion to the}} size of the gymnast. The rope should, when held down by the feet, reach both of the gymnasts' armpits. One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine. At the ends (to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope) an anti-slip material, either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of 10cm (3.94in). The rope must be coloured, either all or partially and may either be of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope. The fundamental requirements of a rope routine include leaps and skipping. Other elements include swings, throws, circles, rotations and figures of eight. In 2011, the FIG decided to nullify the use of <b>rope</b> <b>in</b> rhythmic gymnastic competitions.|$|E
