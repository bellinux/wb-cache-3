2500|$|In the {{evaluation}} of landslide susceptibility, causes of the s is an important step. Terzaghi describes causes as [...] "internal" [...] and [...] "external" [...] referring to modifications in {{the conditions of the}} stability of the bodies. Whilst the internal causes induce modifications in the material itself which decrease its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> stress, the external causes generally induce an increase of shear stress, so that block or bodies are no longer stable. The triggering causes induce the movement of the mass. Predisposition to movement due to control factors is determining in landslide evolution. Structural and geological factors, as already described, can determine the development of the movement, inducing the presence of mass in kinematic freedom.|$|E

There is almost nothing in the {{literature}} relative to the processing characteristics of this type of meat. Based on prior experience it was assumed that tenderness would be a problem if intact muscles, such as gizzards, were to be eaten. Tenderness was determined by measuring <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> with a Warner-Bratzler shear cell. It was found that cooking by simmering in water or pressure cooking in 15 p. s. i. g. steam did not alter the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> Tenderness of gizzards decreased during the first hour post-slaughter then improved to 24 hours. After 48 hours aging the shear values were about the same as after 4 hours aging. Papain, when used as a tenderizer for the gizzards prior to cooking, resulted in a significant improvement in tenderness. Further, it was observed that piercing the gizzards with a fork several times prior to cooking resulted in an improvement in tenderness. A combination of the piercing and papain treatment yielded a tender product...|$|R

In this state the grains being <b>sheared</b> are said <b>to</b> be 'tumbling' over one another, with no significant granular interlock or sliding plane development affecting the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing.</b> At this point, no inherited fabric or bonding of the soil grains affects the soil strength.|$|R
2500|$|To {{understand}} {{the mechanics of}} soils {{it is necessary to}} understand how normal stresses and shear stresses are shared by the different phases. Neither gas nor liquid provide significant <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shear</b> stress. The shear resistance of soil is provided by friction and interlocking of the particles. The friction depends on the intergranular contact stresses between solid particles. The normal stresses, on the other hand, are shared by the fluid and the particles. [...] Although the pore air is relatively compressible, and hence takes little normal stress in most geotechnical problems, liquid water is relatively incompressible and if the voids are saturated with water, the pore water must be squeezed out in order to pack the particles closer together.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the axisymmetric deformation of an initially spherical, porous vesicle with incompressible membrane having finite <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> in-plane <b>shearing,</b> as the vesicle is compressed between parallel plates. We adopt a thin-shell balance-of-forces formulation {{in which the}} mechanical properties of the membrane are described by a single dimensionless parameter, C, which is {{the ratio of the}} membrane's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> <b>to</b> its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> bending. This results in a novel free-boundary problem which we solve numerically to obtain vesicle shapes as a function of plate separation, h. For small deformations, the vesicle contacts each plate over a small circular area. At a critical value of plate separation, hTC, there is a transcritical bifurcation from which a new branch of solutions emerges, representing buckled vesicles which contact each plate along a circular curve. For the values of C investigated, we find that the transcritical bifurcation is subcritical {{and that there is a}} further saddle-node bifurcation (fold) along the branch of buckled solutions at h = hSN (where hSN > hTC). The resulting bifurcation structure is commensurate with a hysteresis loop in which a sudden transition from an unbuckled solution to a buckled one occurs as h is decreased through hTC and a further sudden transition, this time from a buckled solution to an unbuckled one, occurs as h is increased through hSN. We find that hSN and hTC increase with C, that is, vesicles that resist shear are more prone to buckling. <br/...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{mechanical}} shear on brewing yeast was investigated {{with a focus}} on losses incurred through cell rupture and viability loss.

50|$|Consistency is {{the ability}} of soil to stick to itself or to other objects (cohesion and {{adhesion}} respectively) and its ability to resist deformation and rupture. It is of approximate use in predicting cultivation problems and the engineering of foundations. Consistency is measured at three moisture conditions: air-dry, moist, and wet. In those conditions the consistency quality depends upon the clay content. In the wet state, the two qualities of stickiness and plasticity are assessed. A soil's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> fragmentation and crumbling is assessed in the dry state by rubbing the sample. Its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>shearing</b> forces is assessed in the moist state by thumb and finger pressure. Additionally, the cemented consistency depends on cementation by substances other than clay, such as calcium carbonate, silica, oxides and salts; moisture content has little effect on its assessment. The measures of consistency border on subjective compared to other measures such as pH, since they employ the apparent feel of the soil in those states.|$|R
