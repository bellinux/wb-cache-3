5|$|Australia sailed for Devonport, Devon in mid-February 1913 {{to begin}} her {{acceptance}} trials. Testing of the guns, torpedoes, and machinery was successful, {{but it was}} discovered that two hull plates had been damaged during the launch, requiring the battlecruiser to dock for repairs. Australia was commissioned into the <b>RAN</b> <b>at</b> Portsmouth on 21 June 1913.

5|$|Brighton's origins {{lie in the}} Saxon {{fishing and}} {{agricultural}} village of Bristelmestune. The English Channel formed its southern limit, but on all other sides was farmland divided into open fields called laines. These were further subdivided into furlongs—wide parallel strips—and paul-pieces, which were much narrower strips. Despite their small size, neighbouring paul-pieces often had different owners. Wide paths (leakways) <b>ran</b> <b>at</b> right-angles to the furlongs, separating them. This ancient land-use pattern, which survived until the 18th century despite its unsuitability for contemporary farming methods, significantly influenced the pattern of urban development in 18th- and 19th-century Brighton.|$|E
