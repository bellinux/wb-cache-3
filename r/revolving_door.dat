5|$|When {{the chaos}} {{began to shake}} the {{confidence}} of New York's banks, the city's most famous banker was out of town. J.P. Morgan, the eponymous president of J.P. Morgan & Co., was attending a church convention in Richmond, Virginia. Morgan {{was not only the}} city's wealthiest and most well-connected banker, but he had experience with other similar financial crises—he had helped rescue the U.S. Treasury during the Panic of 1893. As news of the crisis gathered, Morgan returned to Wall Street from his convention late on the night of Saturday, October 19. The following morning, the library of Morgan's brownstone at Madison Avenue and 36th St. had become a <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> of New York City bank and trust company presidents arriving to share information about (and seek help surviving) the impending crisis.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} {{is based on the}} Watergate scandal, as well as other real-life {{political}} events. The two Republicans who follow Bob around were based on H. R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman, two of Richard Nixon's closest advisors during Watergate. Sideshow Bob's campaign advert was based on the famous Willie Horton and <b>Revolving</b> <b>Door</b> political advertisements used by George H. W. Bush during the 1988 United States presidential election. Birch Barlow's question to Mayor Quimby about whether his stance on crime would differ if it was his family being attacked is a reference to Bernard Shaw's similar question to Democratic candidate Michael Dukakis during the 1988 presidential debates. Quimby's appearance during the debate parodies Richard Nixon's appearance during his first televised debate with John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. Nixon had recently recovered from a cold, and sweated considerably throughout, something that was detrimental to the impression he made in the debate.|$|E
25|$|A <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> {{has three}} or four doors that hang on a center shaft and rotate around a {{vertical}} axis within a round enclosure. In high-rise buildings, regular doors are hard to open because of air pressure differentials. In order to address this problem, the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> was invented in 1888 by Theophilus Van Kannel of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Van Kannel patented the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> on August 7, 1888.|$|E
40|$|Drafts in {{high-rise}} buildings {{caused by}} the stack effect can cause noise and reduce the performances of ventilation, cooling and heating systems {{as well as the}} building’s energy efficiency. <b>Revolving</b> <b>doors</b> are generally used as a method to reduce drafts; however, the effect would only be limited to the main entrance on the lobby floor. <b>Revolving</b> <b>doors</b> have two main advantages; that their opening areas are seldom changed by people passing through the doors, and the doors do not have the pressure-related functional problems. Considering these advantages, this study examined a quantitative draft reduction method using <b>revolving</b> <b>doors</b> in high-rise buildings. This method would contribute to the design process to install <b>revolving</b> <b>doors</b> to buildings and consists of 10 steps with two key steps of selecting the installation locations of <b>revolving</b> <b>doors</b> and to calculate the air leakage area of <b>revolving</b> <b>doors.</b> Verification through simulations showed that, based on this process, the use of <b>revolving</b> <b>doors</b> could reduce the drafts in buildings by a quantified target value. Furthermore, the possibility of problems due to the stack effect in the other walls of buildings would decrease due to the pressure sharing of the additional walls fitted to <b>revolving</b> <b>doors...</b>|$|R

25|$|In lobbying, the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> is the cycling {{of former}} federal {{employees}} into jobs as lobbyists while former K Street employees are pulled into government positions. Government officials can only work certain terms in their positions, for example senators, and afterwards they form valuable connections {{that could help}} influence future law making. The other form of the <b>revolving</b> <b>door</b> is pushing lobbyists into government positions, and then developing connections and returning into the lobbying world to use said connections. This is a controversial issue in the political lobbying world.|$|E
