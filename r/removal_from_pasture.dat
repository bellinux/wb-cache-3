40|$|The {{impact of}} a late fall {{treatment}} on the spring rise of fecal egg counts was evaluated in a controlled study with Canadian horses treated with 2 different dewormers immediately after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>pasture</b> for winter housing. The horses were stabled {{until the end of}} the trial period. Seventeen weanlings, 20 yearlings, and 15 2 -year-old horses located in Ontario, which were presumed to be naturally infected with cyathostomins after pasture grazing, were randomly allocated to either a group treated with 0. 4 mg/kg of moxidectin and 2. 5 mg/kg of praziquantel or a group treated with 0. 2 mg/kg of ivermectin and 1. 5 mg/kg of praziquantel. Three weeks after treatment, all strongyle fecal egg counts were reduced to zero for both treatment groups. However, at 5 months post-treatment, mean geometric fecal egg counts were statistically higher for the yearlings and 2 -year-old horses treated with ivermectin than for the yearlings and 2 -year-old horses treated with moxidectin (P < 0. 0001) ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{efficacy}} of eprinomectin in an extended-release injection (ERI) formulation was evaluated against infections with third-stage larvae or eggs of gastrointestinal and pulmonary nematodes in cattle under 120 -day natural challenge conditions {{in a series}} of five studies conducted in the USA (three studies) and in Europe (two studies). For each study, 30 nematode-free (four studies) or 30 cattle harboring naturally acquired nematode infections (one study) were included. The cattle were of various breeds or crosses, weighed 107. 5 – 273 kg prior to treatment and aged approximately 4 – 11 months. For each study, animals were blocked based on pre-treatment bodyweight and then randomly allocated to treatment: ERI vehicle (control) at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight or Eprinomectin 5 % (w/v) ERI at 1 mL/ 50 kg bodyweight (1. 0 mg eprinomectin/kg) for a total of 15 and 15 animals in each group. Treatments were administered once on Day 0 by subcutaneous injection in front of the shoulder. In each study, all animals grazed one naturally contaminated pasture for 120 days. At regular intervals during the studies, fecal samples from all cattle were examined for nematode egg and larval counts. In four studies pairs of tracer cattle were used to monitor pasture infectivity at 28 -day intervals before and/or during the grazing period. All calves were weighed before turnout onto pasture and at regular intervals until housing on Day 120. For parasite recovery, all study animals were humanely euthanized 27 – 30 days after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>pasture.</b> Cattle treated with Eprinomectin ERI had significantly (p 92 %: Dictyocaulus viviparus (adults and fourth-stage larvae (L 4), Bunostomum phlebotomum, Cooperia curticei, Cooperia oncophora, Cooperia punctata, Cooperia surnabada, Cooperia spp. inhibited L 4, Haemonchus contortus, Haemonchus placei, Haemonchus spp. inhibited L 4, Nematodirus helvetianus, Nematodirus spp. inhibited L 4, Oesophagostomum radiatum, Oesophagostomum spp. inhibited L 4, Ostertagia leptospicularis, Ostertagia lyrata, Ostertagia ostertagi, Ostertagia spp. inhibited L 4, Trichostrongylus axei, Trichostrongylus colubriformis, Trichostrongylus spp. inhibited L 4, Trichuris discolor, and Trichuris ovis. Over the 120 -day grazing period, Eprinomectin ERI-treated cattle gained between 4. 8 kg and 31 kg more weight than the controls. This weight gain advantage was significant (p< 0. 05) in three studies. All animals accepted the treatment well. No adverse reaction to treatment was observed in any animal in any study...|$|E
40|$|The Donkey Sanctuary Devon has, {{like many}} equine units, faced {{problems}} with anthelmintic resistance within the cyathostomin parasite population. Cyathostomins are ubiquitous, {{and although they}} are to some extent tolerated by their hosts they are also linked to potentially serious disease processes, making their management {{an important part of}} equine husbandry. Over use of the available anthelmintics has been blamed for the current situation, with cases of drug resistance reported across all the classes of anthelmintic currently licensed for use in equidae. Alternative methods of controlling cyathostomins include pasture hygiene by removal of faeces, which theoretically reduces re-infection by removing the immature larval stages from the grazing area, and targeted selective treatment (TST), which works by treating those animals shedding the highest number of eggs and leaving other animals untreated. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate these methods of parasite control at The Donkey Sanctuary Devon over an entire grazing season. The most widely used method of monitoring parasitism is the Faecal Worm Egg Count (FWEC), which is known to be highly variable and can be difficult to analyse appropriately using traditional statistical methods. Therefore, computationally intensive Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods were employed, to ensure that the conclusions made are robust. A faecal egg count reduction test (FECRT) was also used to evaluate anthelmintic drug efficacy {{at the end of the}} study. There was a study population of 667 donkeys, divided into 15 groups under four different management strategies across four farms of The Donkey Sanctuary Devon. Ninety pasture larval counts and nearly 3000 FWEC were conducted from May 2010 to November 2010, followed by a FECRT on a proportion of the study population. The principal conclusion was that twice-weekly removal of faeces from pasture, combined with a relatively high TST threshold of 2000 EPG, provides control of cyathostominosis in the donkey population studied. Manual removal of faeces (rather than using an automated sweeper) was also found to significantly reduce the requirement for anthelmintic doses when using a treatment threshold of 2000 EPG. Where faeces <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>pasture</b> is not practical, lower TST thresholds provide greater control of cyathostomin transmission than higher thresholds, at the cost of more frequent dosing. The groups with higher dosing rates showed reduced drug efficacy at the end of the grazing season, highlighting the necessity to reduce reliance on anthelmintic use. Table of contents...|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{level of}} {{anthelmintic}} resistance within some cyathostomin parasite populations has increased {{to the level}} where sole reliance on anthelmintic-based control protocols is not possible. Management-based nematode control methods, including <b>removal</b> of faeces <b>from</b> <b>pasture,</b> are widely recommended for use in association with a reduction in anthelmintic use to reduce selection pressure for drug resistance; however, very little work has been performed to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of such methods. Methods: We analysed data obtained from 345 donkeys at The Donkey Sanctuary (Devon, UK), managed under three different pasture management techniques, to investigate the effectiveness of faeces removal in strongyle control in equids. The management groups were as follows: no <b>removal</b> of faeces <b>from</b> <b>pasture,</b> manual, twice-weekly <b>removal</b> of faeces <b>from</b> <b>pasture</b> and automatic, twice-weekly <b>removal</b> of faeces <b>from</b> <b>pasture</b> (using a mechanical <b>pasture</b> sweeper). <b>From</b> turn-out onto <b>pasture</b> in May, monthly faecal egg counts were obtained for each donkey and the dataset subjected to an auto regressive moving average model. Results: There was little to no difference in faecal egg counts between the two methods of faecal removal; both resulted in significantly improved cyathostomin control compared to the results obtained from the donkeys that grazed <b>pasture</b> <b>from</b> {{which there was no}} faecal removal. Conclusions: This study represents a valuable and unique assessment of the effectiveness of the removal of equine faeces <b>from</b> <b>pasture,</b> and provides an evidence base from which to advocate twice-weekly <b>removal</b> of faeces <b>from</b> <b>pasture</b> as an adjunct for equid nematode control. Widespread adoption of this practice could substantially reduce anthelmintic usage, and hence reduce selection pressure for nematode resistance to the currently effective anthelmintic products. </p...|$|R
40|$|Successive {{pairs of}} {{approximately}} 4 -month-old Friesland bull calves, raised under worm-free conditions, {{were exposed to}} helminth infection for 14 days on dry-land Kikuyu grass pastures at 28 -day to monthly intervals, on a coastal farm in a non-seasonal rainfall region of the Eastern Cape Province. With {{the exception of one}} pair of calves exposed for 28 days, this procedure was repeated for 28 consecutive months from December 1982 to March 1985. The day after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pastures</b> one calf of each pair was slaughtered and processed for helminth recovery and the other 21 days later. Both members of the last four pairs of calves were killed 21 days after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pastures.</b> Sixteen nematode species were recovered from the calves, and infection with Ostertagia ostertagi was the most intense and prevalent, followed by Cooperia oncophora. The calves acquired the greatest number of nematodes <b>from</b> the <b>pastures</b> <b>from</b> June to October of the first year and from June to August of the second year of the survey. Few worms were recovered from the tracer calves examined from November or December to March or April in each year of the survey. The seasonal patterns of infection with Cooperia spp., Haemonchus placei, Nematodirus helvetianus, Oesophagostomum spp., O. ostertagi and Trichostrongylus axei were all similar and were negatively correlated to atmospheric temperature and evaporation. Slight to moderate arrest in the development of fourth stage larvae occurred from July to September in Cooperia spp., April to July in H. placei, and August to October in O. ostertagi and Trichostrongylus spp. {{during the first year of}} the survey. Too few worms were present in the second year to determine a seasonal pattern of arrest. Species survival during the hot and windy summer months appeared to be achieved via a combination of arrested larval development and an ageing residual population of adult worms in the host, and a small extant population of infective larvae on the pastures. </span...|$|R
40|$|Two {{groups of}} three month old, parasite-free calves grazed a {{permanently}} infected pasture for 14 days, Group A {{during the first two}} weeks of September and Group B during early November.

Marked inhibition of development occurred for Cooperia oncophora with a variable lower level of inhibition for Ostertagia ostertagi and practically none for Nematodirus helvetianus in those calves grazing late in the fall. Under the conditions of this study, inhibited Cooperia larvae resumed development in several calves soon after they were stabled while small numbers of Ostertagia resumed development regularly during the winter and spring with a considerable number of Ostertagia still present when the calves were slaughtered at the end of the stabling period. On the other hand, Nematodirus and practically all Cooperia worms were lost during the stabling period. In three of seven calves grazing late fall pastures, large Cooperia infections were either not established or failed to become patent...|$|R

New Zealand Veterinary Journal, 31 (1 - 2), 4 - 6 A plug sampling technique based on a modified muscle biopsy instrument, was developed for the measurement of muscle pH without mutilation of the carcase. It was found possible to routinely obtain muscle tissue samples weighing approximately 2 g and when these were incubated for 24 hours under liquid paraffin at room temperature, followed by homogenisation in a 'Colworth Stomacher', the pH of the solution {{was found to be}} an accurate measurement of the ultimate pH of the muscle. Both the sample method and a direct probe method were found to be well suited for measuring the ultimate pH of muscles. However, the sample method had a higher degree of precision as compared to the probe method when used for measuring pre-rigor pH values. In a longitudinal survey, in which 1536 lamb carcases were examined, 85. 2 % of carcases were found to have ultimate pH values below 5. 80. Highly significant associations were found between season (summer period) and breed (Perendales) and unsatisfactorily high values of ultimate pH. There was also a highly significant direct correlation between the duration of holding periods of lambs and the ultimate pH of meat, whereas there was a highly significant inverse correlation between wool score and ultimate pH. It was concluded that nutrition {{plays an important role in}} the development of high ultimate pH values. Studies at the meat works indicated that there is a highly significant linear relationship between the number of times lambs are washed prior to slaughter and the ultimate pH of the longissimus muscle. Subsequent resting of animals for varying periods prior to slaughter has no apparent effect on repletion of glycogen stores and may, in some cases, exacerbate the problem of high pH meat. It was also found that washing of lambs is associated with a highly significant increase in bruising of carcases and that such washing may not necessarily result in a decrease in carcase contamination. Investigations of the changes of body weights and the weights and nature of ruminoreticular contents during the preslaughter holding period indicated that the ideal time to slaughter lambs, in terms of potential carcase contamination, is 18 to 24 hours after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> <b>pasture.</b> It was found that stunning by a 'head-to-leg' electrical method significantly increased the rate of pH decline compared to other methods of slaughter. A further increase in the rate of pH decline was achieved by low voltage stimulation at the time of slaughter. It was concluded that the combined effects of low voltage and high voltage stimulation can cause irreversible contraction and associated toughness in a large proportion of carcases. Studies of the occurrence of haemorrhages in carcases and organs indicated that these defects are related to the method of stunning. Although blood splash has been reported to be associated with prolonged one stage prothrombin times in lambs, no statistical association was found between this parameter and speckling. It was found that there is a two to threefold increase in arterial pressure following 'head-only' stunning whereas there was only a moderate increase in venous pressure. On the other hand, stunning by the 'head-to-back' method was followed by a decrease in arterial pressure, but venous pressure increased to levels above 50 mm Hg. Electromyographic studies indicated that there is a significant increase in the intensity of muscular activity following 'head-to-back' stunning as compared to 'head-only stunning and that there is a correlation between the increased muscular activity and the increase in venous pressure. It is concluded that these events may lead to pressure changes in the microcirculatory bed which are likely to be associated with the occurrence of haemorrhagic defects following stunning by electrical methods...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} has indicated that serotonergic and α-adrenergic receptors in peripheral vasculature are affected by exposure of cattle grazing toxic endophyte-infected (E+; Epichlöe coenophialia) tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum). The objective of this experiment was to determine the period of time necessary for the vascular effects of ergot alkaloids to subside. Two experiments were conducted to investigate changes in vascular contractile response and vasoconstriction over time relative to <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> an ergot alkaloid-containing E+ tall fescue pasture. In Experiment 1, lateral saphenous vein biopsies were conducted on 21 predominantly Angus steers (357 ± 3 kg body weight) at 0 (n = 6), 7 (n = 6), 14 (n = 5), or 28 days (n = 4) after <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> grazing <b>pasture</b> (3. 0 ha; endpoint ergovaline + ergovalinine = 1. 35 mg/kg DM) for 126 days. In Experiment 2, lateral saphenous veins were biopsied from 24 Angus-cross steers (361 ± 4 kg body weight) at 0, 21, 42, and 63 days (n = 6 per time point) following <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> grazing tall fescue pastures (3. 0 ha; first 88 days endpoint ergovaline + ergovalinine = 0. 15 mg/kg DM; last 18 days endpoint ergovaline + ergovalinine = 0. 57 mg/kg DM) for 106 total days. Six steers (370 ± 18 kg body weight) off of bermudagrass pasture for the same time interval were also biopsied on Day 0 and Day 63 (n = 3 per time point). Additionally, in Experiment 2, cross-sectional ultrasound scans of caudal artery at the fourth coccygeal vertebra were taken on Days 0, 8, 15, 21, 29, 36, 42, and 45 to determine mean artery luminal area to evaluate vasoconstriction. In both experiments, steers were removed <b>from</b> <b>pasture</b> and housed in a dry lot and fed a corn silage diet for the duration of biopsies and ultrasound scans. Biopsied vessels used to evaluate vasoactivity were cleaned, incubated in a multimyograph, and exposed to increasing concentrations of 4 -Bromo- 3, 6 -dimethoxybenzocyclobuten- 1 -yl) methylamine hydrobromide (TCB 2; 5 HT 2 A agonist), guanfacine (GF; α 2 A-adrenergic agonist), and (R) -(+) -m-nitrobiphenyline oxalate (NBP; α 2 C-adrenergic agonist) in both experiments and ergovaline (ERV) and ergotamine (ERT) in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. In Experiment 1, days off pasture × agonist concentration was not significant (p > 0. 1) for all four compounds tested. In Experiment 2, GF, NBP, TCB 2 and ERT were significant for days off pasture × agonist concentration interaction (p < 0. 02) and vasoactivity increased over time. Vasoactivity to agonists was reduced (p < 0. 05) when steers were initially removed from E+ tall fescue pasture compared to bermudagrass, but did not differ by Day 63 for any variable. Luminal areas of caudal arteries in steers grazed on E+ tall fescue relaxed and were similar to steers that had grazed bermudagrass for 36 days on non-toxic diet (p = 0. 15). These data demonstrate changes in peripheral vasoactivity and recovery from vasoconstriction occur beyond five weeks off toxic pasture and 5 HT 2 A receptors appear to be more dramatically affected in the lateral saphenous vein by grazing E+ tall fescue pasture than adrenergic receptors...|$|R

Organic C and N in litter and soil (0 - 10 cm and 10 - 30 cm depth) were determined, as well as soil bulk density.
