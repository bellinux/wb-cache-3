Deployed by parachute near Chartres, disguised as a postal worker, Veuve acquired and transmitted information about crucial enemy infrastructure, such as Le Bourget airport, an oil refinery and an underground rocket factory. To avoid <b>radiolocation</b> of his signal, he emplaced himself close to a German military unit's transmitter. After the Allied invasion, Veuve shifted his operations further inland, on one occasion narrowly escaping an SS raid with a bullet wound in his foot, while his two bodyguards were captured and executed.

40|$|Abstract: The {{population}} {{status of the}} Florida black bear (Ursus americanus floridanus) is problematic within many portions of its range and its potential listing as a federally threatened species {{has been the subject}} of legal debate. We studied Florida black bears in 2 areas in the Okefenokee-Osceola ecosystem in southeast Georgia (i. e., Okefenokee) and north Florida (i. e., Osceola) from 1995 to 1999 to evaluate relationships between population characteristics, habitat conditions, and human activities. Bears in Okefenokee were hunted and those in Osceola were not. We captured 205 different black bears (124 M: 81 F) 345 times from June 1995 to September 1998. We obtained 13, 573 <b>radiolocations</b> from 87 (16 M: 71 F) individual bears during the study. In Okefenokee, black gum (Nyssa sylvatica) and saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) fruits were the most important foods for bears based on scat analysis. In Osceola, corn from white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) feeders was the most stable food source but saw palmetto was heavily used when available. Corn from deer feeders was not avail-able in Okefenokee. Adult bears in Osceola were 29 % heavier than those in Okefenokee (t 82 = 3. 55, P < 0. 001).

40|$|Although {{accurate}} {{estimates of}} wild boar (Sus scrofa) populations are crucial for any effective resource management or pest control programme, this species {{is well known}} {{to be difficult to}} monitor. We conducted a ten-year study in a fenced Mediterranean forest (Rome, Italy) to evaluate nocturnal line transect sampling performances. We focused on its accuracy in monitoring changes in density, which was independently estimated by Capture-Mark-Resight performed on counts at feeding sites. We carried out night surveys in the autumn of 2001 - 2010, using portable infrared cameras to detect animals. We sampled on foot to cover the whole study area and the different habitat types evenly. However, to ensure safe working conditions during night and to limit disturbance, we placed transects along paths and forest roads. Therefore, we investigated the potential impact of our convenience sampling on the detection process, using <b>radiolocations</b> of wild boars to assess their distribution with respect to selected transects. We found that our survey design should not have biased our estimates and that densities and coefficients of variations from line transect sampling were consistent with CMR results. Although labour-intensive, we believe that our approach can improve wild boar monitoring effectively, even in concealing habitats, providing decision makers with accurate estimates (and quantified confidence limits) which can help to develop the most appropriate management programme. Moreover, the current low price of new-generation infrared cameras can also increase strongly the cost-effectiveness of this method...|$|R
40|$|The Purcell Mountains of {{southeast}} British Columbia support {{a population of}} mountain caribou near the southernmost extension of their range. This ecotype is dependent upon late-successional forests, largely because such stands provide arboreal lichen for winter forage. Recent provincial forest practices legislation and land-use planning initiatives have provided the impetus for developing an interim caribou habitat assessment model {{for use as a}} planning tool. We applied an HSI (habitat suitability index) model developed for a nearby population as a testable hypothesis of caribou habitat selection in the southern Purcells. In a study area of about 6000 km 2, 512 <b>radiolocations</b> were obtained for 22 animals from 1993 through 1995. Seasonal selectivity was assessed for the following model variables: elevation, slope, habitat type/current cover type, overstory size class, canopy closure, and age of dominant overstory. Caribou were most selective for stand age, which the model also defined as the greatest determinant of habitat suitability. However, we did not judge overall model output to be an adequate predictor of habitat selection by southern Purcell caribou. Seasonal ratings for each variable were therefore modified to better reflect selection patterns by animals in this study, and subjectively adjusted to ensure that potentially limiting habitat types were rated highly. An evaluation of the adjusted model established its efficacy as an interim decision-support tool. Selection analyses of spatial habitat distribution levels indicated a preference by caribou for landscapes with at least 40 % suitable habitat per 250 ha and per 5000 ha. From this, it is apparent that suitable habitat is highly fragmented in this study area...|$|R

40|$|Mounting {{theoretical}} and empirical evidence shows that matrix heterogeneity may have contrasting effects on metapopulation dynamics by contributing to patch isolation in nontrivial ways. We analyze the movement properties during interpatch dispersal in a metapopulation of Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus). On a daily temporal scale, lynx habitat selection defines two types of matrix habitats where individuals may move: open and dispersal habitats (avoided and used as available, respectively). There was a strong and complex impact of matrix heterogeneity on movement properties at several temporal scales (hourly and daily <b>radiolocations</b> and the entire dispersal event). We use the movement properties on the hourly temporal scale to build a simulation model to reconstruct individual dispersal events. The two most important parameters affecting model predictions at both the individual (daily) and metapopulation scales {{were related to the}} movement capacity (number of movement steps per day and autocorrelation in dispersal habitat) followed by the parameters representing the habitat selection in the matrix. The model adequately reproduced field estimates of population‐level parameters (e. g., interpatch connectivity, maximum and final dispersal distances), and its performance was clearly improved when including the effect of matrix heterogeneity on movement properties. To assume there is a homogeneous matrix results in large errors in the estimate of interpatch connectivity, especially for close patches separated by open habitat or corridors of dispersal habitat, showing {{how important it is to}} consider matrix heterogeneity when it is present. Movement properties affect the interaction of dispersing individuals with the landscape and can be used as a mechanistic representation of dispersal at the metapopulation level. This is so when the effect of matrix heterogeneity on movement properties is evaluated under biologically meaningful spatial and temporal scales. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSpatial {{dynamics}} of foraging long-fingered bats () were {{studied in the}} Eastern Iberian Peninsula. We analysed the locations of 45 radio-tracked individuals during three discrete periods through the breeding season and measured the spatial parameters related to their foraging behaviour {{in order to test}} whether variations in spatial use occur. Colony range, measured as the minimum convex polygon through all the <b>radiolocations,</b> was 345  km, but the area used during each period was smaller. During pre-breeding, foraging bats gathered at two stretches of different tributary rivers; during lactation, they scattered throughout the river system; and during weaning, they aggregated at a stretch of the main river. Individuals on average flew 5. 7  km from roosts to foraging areas, with a maximum absolute distance of 22. 7  km. Individual foraging ranges were measured linearly, because the bats foraged mostly along rivers; their values averaged 1. 3  km/night and overlapped extensively between neighbouring bats (> 65 % on average). The sampling period, rather than the bats' reproductive status, age, or sex, explained the observed variability in spatial distribution and size of hunting sites. We did not find differences in spatial parameters between lactating females and non-lactating bats, nor between juveniles and adults. This is the first study to split the independent effects of season and population class in order to enable unconfounded interpretations of the spatial {{dynamics of}} foraging reproductive females and juveniles. We speculate that the relationship between colony size and prey availability ruled the observed changes in foraging area through seasons. The considerable overlap in individual foraging ranges may be a necessary adaption to large colonies forced by the specific roost requirements of the long-fingered bat and the narrow foraging niche they appear to occupy...|$|R
40|$|Predation on sheep by coyotes (Canis latrans) is {{a longstanding}} problem for sheep producers. Current {{research}} suggests that surgical sterilization of coyotes {{could prove to be}} an effective method of reducing their depredation rates on domestic sheep by modifying their predatory behavior. However, for sterilization to be a viable management tool, the territorial and affiliative behaviors of pack members would need to remain in place. We tested whether surgically sterilized coyotes maintained pair bonds and territories {{in the same manner as}} intact coyotes. We also examined if territory fidelity and survival rates differed between sterile and intact coyotes. From June 1997 to April 2000, 10 males and 9 females were sham-operated and radio-collared, while 20 males and 6 females were surgically sterilized and radio-collared. We monitored members of 5 sterile and 4 intact packs during 1998, 6 sterile and 7 intact packs during 1999, and 4 sterile and 6 intact packs through the 2000 breeding season. Behaviorally, sterile packs appeared to be no different than intact packs. A half-weight association index showed that social dyads within sterile coyote packs were located together as frequently as dyads within intact packs. Simultaneous <b>radiolocations</b> of members of sterile packs showed that members of sterile packs were significantly closer to each other than would be expected from random locations. There was no difference in size or degree of overlap between territories of sterile and sham-operated coyote packs. Sterile coyotes had a higher annual survival rate than reproductive animals in 2 of the 3 years, and there was no difference in the level of territory fidelity. We concluded that surgical sterilization did not modify the territorial or affiliative behaviors of free-ranging coyotes, and therefore sterile coyotes could be used as a management tool to exclude other potential sheep-killing coyotes...|$|R

40|$|Although {{prescribed}} burning {{has been used}} frequently for manipulating habitat, it has been rarely used in grassland areas {{with the intent to}} improve habitat quality for wild turkeys (Meleagris gallapavo). I studied breeding season and nest location habitat use of wild turkey hens in response to grassland fire management, and quantified its impact on foraging habitat and insect prey for turkey poults, in a diverse agricultural landscape in southern Illinois. Fire management was conducted on 28 ha of grassland in March and April 2012. <b>Radiolocations</b> from 64 radiomarked hens from 2008 - 2010 and 44 radiomarked hens from 2012 - 2013 were used to create turkey habitat and nest location models for both pre-fire and post-fire time periods. Areas used by turkeys throughout all models and time periods were characterized by high proportions of forested habitat. Nest locations during both time periods also included areas with higher percentages of shrubland and edge habitat. Turkey use areas during the post-fire time period were found to be further from burned areas, suggesting that fires on short rotations (1 - 2 years) were slightly detrimental to habitat needed during the breeding season and for nest locations. 	Field trials using human-imprinted wild (n= 54) and commercial (n= 64) strain turkey poults were conducted to assess the foraging efficiency and mobility of poult type within burned and unburned grassland sections. Foraging efficiency of turkey poults did not differ between burned or unburned fields, or between wild and commercial strain poults. All poults showed selection of invertebrate categories Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Isopoda throughout all grassland field trials, whereas avoidance of Araneae, Diptera, Entognatha, Hemiptera, Lepidoptera, and Orthoptera was exhibited by all poults in all trials. There was evidence to believe that burned grasslands increased the travel efficiency of poults compared to unburned grasslands. Wild poults were able to travel further distances and along less sinuous paths than commercial poults...|$|R
