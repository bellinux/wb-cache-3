5|$|Lucas and Leonard Rapping {{laid out}} the first new {{classical}} approach to aggregate supply in 1969. Under their model, changes in employment are based on worker preferences for leisure time.

5|$|Nevertheless, the {{bombardment}} caused {{a large number}} of casualties. Though some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge.

5|$|The {{control of}} Vijithapura was {{essential}} to both sides. The loss of the stronghold would be a largely demoralizing factor for Elara's forces and would significantly <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> capability to resist Duthhagamani's advance.

5|$|A {{survey of}} New York {{businesses}} found {{an increase of}} 8.5 percent in health care costs, less than the prior year's survey had expected. A 10 percent increase was expected for 2017. Factors included increased premiums, higher drug costs, ACA and aging workers. Some firms lowered costs by increasing cost-sharing (for higher employee contributions, deductibles and co-payments). 60% planned to further increase cost-sharing. Coverage and benefits were not expected to change. Approximately one fifth said ACA had pushed them to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> workforce. A larger number said they were raising prices.|$|E

Also, the Arizona Diamondbacks received Yankees pitcher Ian Kennedy and Tigers pitcher Edwin Jackson in return for young pitchers Max Scherzer and Daniel Schlereth, who joined the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Another nocturnal {{adaptation}} {{can be seen}} in kangaroo rats, which exhibit moonlight avoidance. These rodents forage {{in relatively}} open habitats and <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. In controlled experiments, artificial moon-like illumination stimulates similar responses in their foraging behavior, suggesting that this behavior has evolved to reduce predation risk.|$|E
5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> dietary intake of salt. High sodium intake {{is associated with}} a greater risk of stroke, total cardiovascular disease and kidney disease. A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement in blood pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E

5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to both groups. However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of both groups lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
5|$|In {{the course}} of normal immune response, parts of {{pathogens}} (e.g. bacteria) are recognized by the immune system as foreign (non-self), and eliminated or effectively neutralized to <b>reduce</b> <b>their</b> potential damage. Such a recognizable substance is called an antigen. The immune system may respond in multiple ways to an antigen; a key feature of this response is the production of antibodies by B cells (or B lymphocytes) involving {{an arm of the}} immune system known as humoral immunity. The antibodies are soluble and do not require direct cell-to-cell contact between the pathogen and the B-cell to function.|$|E
