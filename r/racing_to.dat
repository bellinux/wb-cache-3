5|$|Gugelmin {{signed with}} Dick Simon <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> {{take part in}} the North American Champ Car racing series for the last three races of 1993. Although races at Mid Ohio and Nazareth {{resulted}} in non-finishes, Gugelmin finished 13th at Laguna Seca although this was not high enough to receive any points. Despite this, Gugelmin demonstrated promise. In 1994, Gugelmin signed with Chip Ganassi <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> partner Michael Andretti who returned to the series after a season in Formula One. Andretti was more successful than Gugelmin, and took two wins, including Reynard's first win in Champ Car at Surfers Paradise. Gugelmin was hindered by a lack of cooperation between his and Andretti's crews, and his first full-time year in the Champ Car World Series resulted in seven points finishes and 16th in the points standings.|$|E

40|$|Additional {{tests of}} 178 cultivars and lines of soybean against soybean cyst {{nematode}} are reported. Cultivars are available with some level of resistance <b>to</b> <b>races</b> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 14, {{but in some cases}} the resistance level is moderate. No cultivar or line (except possibly PI 437654) has resistance to all of the races tested.

5|$|Alfred rescued about 100 men; Rattler, about 40; and Culloden, 127, {{including}} Captain Renaudin, who {{abandoned his}} ship {{and left in}} the very first British boat. He was taken to Culloden and served a meal in the officers' mess; as he dined with his son and other French and British officers, a commotion was heard; <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> the gallery of Culloden, the party witnessed Vengeur sink with the remaining wounded aboard. Figures of the casualties on Vengeur are not precisely known, but amount to approximately 250 killed during the battle, 106 drowned in the sinking, and 367 rescued by the British.|$|E
5|$|On June 8, 2016, Richard Childress Racing {{announced}} plans to add Hornish to their Xfinity Series driver lineup, hiring him to drive the No. 2 Chevrolet Camaro at the July Iowa race and Kentucky. He also ran the No. 2 at Mid-Ohio. Additionally, Hornish returned to Joe Gibbs <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> drive the No. 18 Toyota Camry in place of an injured Matt Tifft for the June Iowa race, a race {{he went on to}} win.|$|E
5|$|That {{overwhelming}} start {{was just}} the beginning for the Hokies, who won their next seven games, <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> an 8–0 start and a No.3 ranking in the national polls. In their ninth game of the season, however, the Hokies suffered their first loss, falling 21–28 to the Pittsburgh Panthers. The next week, Tech suffered an even closer loss, losing to Syracuse in triple overtime despite a record performance from Tech quarterback Bryan Randall, who accumulated 504passing yards and fivetouchdown passes.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Race</b> <b>to</b> the Sky is {{an annual}} {{automobile}} and motorcycle gravel hillclimb {{to the summit}} of a mountain in the Cardrona Valley of New Zealand. The race was held every year from 1998 to 2007 for two days over the Easter weekend as the Silverstone <b>Race</b> <b>to</b> the Sky, and will return in 2015 as the Repco <b>Race</b> <b>to</b> the Sky.|$|R
50|$|From its {{inception}} in 1992 through 1996, the race {{was held in the}} summer, as a support <b>race</b> <b>to</b> the Alabama 500.

5|$|The inaugural race, held in 2001, was {{marred by}} {{drainage}} problems, and was won by Team Penske driver Gil de Ferran. It was last held the following year when a poor trading environment and inclement weather conditions affected the track. The race was moved to Brands Hatch for 2003 under the name London Champ Car Trophy. The event was instrumental in helping the Rockingham Motor Speedway become established on the world motor sport scene, and brought {{a new type of}} <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> Britain.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer, all the major film {{companies}} were <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> hire audio engineers so they could record and reproduce sound for film. Through common acquaintances at Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI) within Western Electric, Hilliard was contacted and hired by United Artists Studios (UA) in Hollywood, California in 1928 because of his studies in physics, engineering and acoustics. Having left his Masters studies behind in Minnesota, Hilliard, not yet 28 years old, supervised all sound recording for Coquette, UA's first talking motion picture. Western Electric provided recording equipment, but the specific techniques for achieving best sound on film had to be developed by hard work and imagination. Hilliard's ground-breaking methods later became industry standards.|$|E
5|$|After the war the {{greyhound}} company introduced floodlights and in 1958 {{the entire}} surface required relaying after the Commonwealth Games had finished. In 1971 the Welsh Greyhound Derby was given 'classic' status. In 1977 the Cardiff City Council announced that a revamp of the Arms Park site would not include greyhound racing. The Welsh Rugby Union required the Arms Park track to extend terracing at the National Stadium. The last Welsh Greyhound Derby was on 9 July and the last meeting was held on 30 July. 1,128 greyhound fans saw Lillyput Queen, owned by Cardiff butcher Malcolm Davies and trained by Freddie Goodman, win the last race. Cardiff City Council had taken less than ten minutes to reject a plan to switch greyhound <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> nearby Maindy Stadium.|$|E

5|$|At the Springfield Derby, Duncan {{wins the}} race. Enraged, the furious jockeys chase after Homer and Bart {{wielding}} swords to hunt {{them down and}} destroy them. With the help of Marge and Lisa, who spray water on the jockeys with a hose, Homer is able to put the jockeys into a garbage bag and get them sent to the dump. Afterwards, Homer and Bart prepare for Duncan's retirement from <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> {{start a new life}} as a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house to see Lisa, presenting her with a plaque. Clinton says that Ogdenville was wrong to use glowsticks and that Springfield Elementary's band is the true champion.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2001 Indy Racing League season, Hornish {{moved to}} Panther <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> drive the No. 4 Dallara IR01-Oldsmobile Aurora L47 V8. He began {{the season with}} {{consecutive}} victories at Phoenix and Homestead-Miami {{in his first two}} races with the team. At the Indianapolis 500, Hornish qualified in 13th place. He finished 14th, four laps behind after an early spin. He continued to drive well, clinching the championship before the final race of the season (a second-place finish at Chicagoland Speedway). Since the winner of each race receives 50 points, Hornish's 66-point advantage clinched the championship with one race remaining. At the season-ending race at Texas he started in the pole position, leading for 115 laps in his third win of the season. Hornish won the championship with 503 points, 105 points ahead of second-place Buddy Lazier. At age 22, he was the youngest champion in series history.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{went to the}} No. 35 Chevrolet for Laughlin Racing for the 1993 Busch Series, {{and drove}} in twenty-four races. At the season-opening Goody's 300, she retired after 71 laps due to a blown engine; her team also changed {{manufacturers}} during the season from Oldsmobile to Pontiac. She took her best finish {{of the season with}} an eleventh-place result in the Kroger 200 at Indianapolis Raceway Park. She did not qualify for four races in the 1993 season. Robinson finished the year 23rd in the final points standings, the highest of her Busch Series career. She made her first start in the Busch North Series (now the K Pro Series East) at New Hampshire Motor Speedway where she qualified, but finished in 34th position after her engine failed. Robinson returned to Ferree <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> drive the No. 46 Chevrolet for the 1994 Busch Series season.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{the race}} was {{scheduled}} in March, but in 2002 the MVRC moved the <b>race</b> <b>to</b> late January. The renaming of the <b>race</b> <b>to</b> the current name coincides with the Australia Day public holiday.|$|R

5|$|Speculation {{regarding}} {{moves to}} the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Žigić had appeared just once for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> release Luis Fernández on medical grounds, because of a degenerative condition of his knee, thus freeing up a space in the first-team squad. The LFP's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career-ending, so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign.|$|E
5|$|Alonso made a {{complaint}} about Hamilton and asked {{his team to}} work with the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile race director Charlie Whiting to discuss the issue with the safety car. Massa attempted to pass Liuzzi around the outside heading into turn 17 but Liuzzi turned right to defend the position. Shortly afterwards, Massa made a slight mistake which allowed Alguersuari to close the gap. Hamilton started to conserve fuel and prepare for a late attack on lap 20. On the following lap, it was announced Hamilton would be investigated by the stewards for his safety car overtake for which he was given a drive-through penalty which he served on the 27th lap. He remained in second position due to Kobayashi holding {{up the rest of the}} field. Massa placed further pressure upon Liuzzi but was unable to pass him. A glass bottle appeared on the outside of the track on lap 28 which was retrieved by a marshal three laps later to allow <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> continue unaffected. Massa made an error at the final turn on lap 35 which meant he fell behind Liuzzi in the battle for 14th place.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2011 season Penske {{sold the}} owners' points of its No. 77 car to Rusty Wallace <b>Racing,</b> <b>to</b> {{be driven by}} owner Rusty Wallace's son (and team driver) Steve at the season-opening Daytona 500, for {{financial}} reasons. As a result, Penske moved Hornish to the Nationwide Series to drive the team's No. 12 Dodge Charger. He drove the 5-hour Energy 500 at Pocono Raceway in Front Row Motorsports' No.38 Ford Fusion, filling in for Travis Kvapil (who was driving in a Truck Series event at Texas). Hornish started in 26th place and finished 35th, 60 laps behind. He drove twelve races with the No. 12 team, moving to Penske's No. 22 for a 13th race at Iowa Speedway. At Iowa Hornish started in third place and led from laps 13 through 51, later dropping five laps behind to finish 24th. In the WYPALL* 200 Powered by Kimberly-Clark Professional at Phoenix International Raceway, he started in fifth place and led for the race's final 61 laps after passing Ricky Stenhouse Jr. (who led for a race-high 73 laps) for his first career victory in the series.|$|E

5|$|Constantine I (r. 306–337) {{preferred}} chariot <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> gladiatorial combat, {{which he}} considered a vestige of paganism. However, {{the end of}} gladiatorial games in the Empire {{may have been more}} the result of the difficulty and expense that came with procuring gladiators to fight in the games, than the influence of Christianity in Byzantium. The Olympic Games were eventually ended by Emperor Theodosius I (r. 379–395) in 393, perhaps in a move to suppress paganism and promote Christianity, but chariot racing remained popular. The fact that chariot racing became linked to the imperial majesty meant that the Church did not prevent it, although gradually prominent Christian writers, such as Tertullian, began attacking the sport. Despite the influence of Christianity in the Byzantine Empire, venationes, bloody wild-beast hunts, continued as a form of popular entertainment during {{the early days of the}} Empire as part of the extra entertainment that went along with chariot racing. Eventually, Emperor Leo (r. 457–474) banned public entertainments on Sundays in 469, showing that the hunts did not have imperial support, and the venationes were banned completely by Emperor Anastasius (r. 491–518) in 498. Anastasius was praised for this action by some sources, but their concern seems to be more for the danger the hunts could put humans in rather than for objections to the brutality or moral objections. There continued to be burnings and mutilations of humans who committed crimes or were enemies of the state in the hippodrome throughout the Byzantine Empire, as well as victory celebrations and imperial coronations.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Lapierre {{sustained}} a puncture {{on his car}} during the race's final lap, allowing Strakka <b>Racing</b> <b>to</b> inherit fourth place. Unhindered in the final 35 minutes Fässler was the first driver to finish the race, 47 seconds ahead of Jani in second place, and Kobayashi followed in third position in the No. 6 Toyota. Albuquerque maintained his advantage to take the victory in LMP2, earning him and Senna their first class victories in the World Endurance Championship and González's fourth in the series. They were followed by the No. 31 Extreme Speed Motorspors Ligier of Ryan Dalziel, Derani and Cumming 32 seconds later, with Rusinov, Nathanaël Berthon and Rast in the No. 26 G-Drive Racing Oreca completing the class podium with all three cars finishing on the same lap as each other. The No. 71 AF Corse Ferrari of Bird and Rigon were unchallenged throughout the race and clinched their first victory of the season, in front of teammates Bruni and Calado, with Turner, Nicki Thiim and Marco Sørensen in the No. 95 Aston Martin rounding out the LMGTE Pro podium positions. In LMGTE Am, François Perrodo, Emmanuel Collard and Agias led the final half hour to secure their team's first win {{of the year in}} the category with a one-lap advantage over Aston Martin's No. 95 entry of Paul Dalla Lana, Pedro Lamy and Mathias Lauda.|$|E
5|$|Various non-Truck regulars {{entered the}} race for reasons such as to help a team in the owners' championship, with teams hiring drivers who are {{familiar}} with dirt <b>racing</b> <b>to</b> assist them in the championship. Examples include dirt track specialists Scott Bloomquist, who won The Dream and the World 100 at the track six times and three times, respectively; Tracy Hines, who had 85 career wins, including six at Eldora, and 52 starts in the Truck Series; Jared Landers, who won 100 features in his career; J. R. Heffner, who won the big-block modified championship at Lebanon Valley Speedway twice; Jeff Babcock, who won an American Late Model Series race at the track during 2013; and Joe Cobb, a dirt modified racer and the father of Truck Series regular Jennifer Jo Cobb. Cup Series drivers Dave Blaney, Ken Schrader and Ryan Newman, along with Nationwide Series drivers Austin Dillon, Kenny Wallace and Kyle Larson also ran in the event. Babcock, Blaney, Bloomquist, Hines, Schrader and Wallace had all won races at Eldora in various disciplines. Jason Bowles was later announced as the driver of the No. 5 for Wauters Motorsports, while Chris Jones was originally listed as the driver of the No. 93 for RSS Racing, but eventually withdrew.|$|E
