500|$|On September 27, 2011, Denali National Park ranger Brandon Latham {{arrived to}} assist four climbers {{belonging}} to a [...] "difficult access" [...] team from Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates. The reason for the inspection was the park agency's suspicion {{that there were more}} cracks on the monument's upper section not visible from the inside. The agency said it filled the cracks that occurred on August 23. After Hurricane Irene hit the area on August 27, water was discovered inside the memorial, leading the Park Service to suspect there was more undiscovered damage. The rappellers used radios to report what they found to engineering experts on the ground. Wiss, Janney, Elstner climber Dave Megerle took three hours to set up the rappelling equipment and set up a barrier around the monument's lightning <b>rod</b> <b>system</b> atop the pyramidion; {{it was the first time}} the hatch in the pyramidion had been open since 2000.|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of nonlinearities in material constitutive relations {{has long been}} appreciated in the continuum mechanics of macroscopic rods. Although the moment (torque) response to bending is almost universally linear for small deflection angles, many <b>rod</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit a high-curvature softening. The signature behavior of these <b>rod</b> <b>systems</b> is a kinking transition in which the bending is localized. Recent DNA cyclization experiments by Cloutier and Widom have offered evidence that the linear-elastic bending theory fails to describe the high-curvature mechanics of DNA. Motivated by this recent experimental work, we develop a simple and exact theory of the statistical mechanics of linear-elastic polymer chains that can undergo a kinking transition. We characterize the kinking behavior with a single parameter and show that the resulting theory reproduces both the low-curvature linear-elastic behavior which is already well described by the Wormlike Chain model, {{as well as the}} high-curvature softening observed in recent cyclization experiments.

40|$|Purpose: of {{this work}} is to present {{dynamical}} flexibilities of rotational beams and <b>rods</b> <b>systems.</b> The results ofmathematical calculations were presented {{in the form of}} dynamical flexibility of analyzed systems. In final solutionthere were took into consideration the interactions between the major motions and local vibrations of subsystems. Design/methodology/approach: The dynamical flexibilities were derived by the Galerkin’s method. The dynamicalflexibilities for example numerical cases were presented onto charts of attenuation-frequency characteristics. Themathematical models were derived on the basis of known equations of motion derived in previous thesis’s. Findings: After analysis of characteristics we can observe the transportation effect. We can notice additional poleson the characteristic of dynamical flexibility characteristics and after increasing angular velocity created modessymmetrically propagate from the origin mode and instead of the original mode there is created a zero’s amplitude. Research limitations/implications: Analyzed systems are beams and rods in rotational motion. Motion waslimited to plane motion. Future works will be connected with consideration of complex systems. Practical implications: of derived dynamical flexibilities of free-free and fixed beams and <b>rods</b> <b>systems</b> is apossibility of derivation of the stability zones of analyzed systems and derivation of eigenfrequencies and zerosin the function of angular velocity of work motion. Originality/value: Models analyzed in this thesis apply to rotating <b>rod</b> and beam <b>systems</b> with taking intoconsideration the transportation effect.
