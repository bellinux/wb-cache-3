2500|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} with {{this system is}} that when contacted, the hose does not “retract” into an HDU. [...] Instead, the hose bends depending on how far it is pushed toward the boom. [...] If it is pushed too far, it can loop around the probe or nose of the aircraft, damage the windscreen, or cause contact with the rigid boom. [...] If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. [...] Because of a much smaller position keeping tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. [...] When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the probe <b>refueling</b> <b>valve</b> disconnects from the valve in the basket. [...] Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to “prang” the probe and/or strike the aircraft’s fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} {{the probe}} is a valve that is closed until it mates with the drogue's forward {{internal}} receptacle, after which it opens and allows fuel to pass from tanker to receiver. [...] The valves in the probe and drogue that are most commonly used are to a NATO standard and were originally developed by the company Flight Refuelling Limited in the UK and deployed in the late 1940s and 1950s. [...] This standardization allows drogue-equipped tanker aircraft from many nations the ability to refuel probe-equipped aircraft from other nations. [...] The NATO standard probe system incorporates shear rivets that attach the <b>refueling</b> <b>valve</b> to {{the end of the}} probe. [...] This is so that if a large side or vertical load develops while in contact with the drogue, the rivets shear and the fuel valve breaks off, rather than the probe or receiver aircraft suffering structural damage. [...] A so-called [...] "broken probe" [...] (actually a broken fuel valve, as described above) may happen if poor flying technique is used by the receiver pilot, or in turbulence. [...] Sometimes the valve is retained in the tanker drogue and prevents further refueling from that drogue until removed during ground maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The optimal {{approach}} is {{from behind and}} below (not level with) the drogue. [...] Because the drogue is relatively light (typically soft canvas webbing) and subject to aerodynamic forces, it can be pushed around by the bow wave of approaching aircraft, exacerbating engagement even in smooth air. [...] After initial contact, the hose and drogue is pushed forward by the receiver a certain distance (typically, a few feet), and the hose is reeled slowly back onto its drum in the HDU. [...] This opens the tanker's main <b>refueling</b> <b>valve</b> allowing fuel to flow to the drogue under the appropriate pressure (assuming the tanker crew has energized the pump). [...] Tension on the hose is aerodynamically 'balanced' by a motor in the HDU so that as the receiver aircraft moves fore and aft, the hose retracts and extends, thus preventing bends in the hose that would cause undue side loads on the probe. [...] Fuel flow is typically indicated by illumination of a green light near the HDU. [...] If the hose is pushed in too far or not far enough, a cutoff switch will inhibit fuel flow, which is typically accompanied by an amber light. [...] Disengagement is commanded by the tanker pilot with a red light.|$|E

40|$|Challenger's sixth flight {{launched}} from KSC at 6 : 03 CDT October 5, 1984. It returned to Kennedy eight days later, landing on October 13 th. Since 41 -G was a planned EVA flight, two prime EMUs and one backup short EMU were stowed in the Airlock. No MMUs were carried. Astronaut A and Astronaut B successfully accomplished their 3 l/ 2 hour EVA on October 11 th, Flight Day 7 of the mission. This EVA took place {{the day after}} the EMU Checkout and Maintenance Recharge activities. During this time Astronaut A and Astronaut B completed the planned installation of the Orbital <b>Refueling</b> System Ball <b>Valve</b> mod kit as well as an unplanned activity of locking the gimbals on the Ku-Band antenna. They each performed quite well in their EMUs...|$|R
