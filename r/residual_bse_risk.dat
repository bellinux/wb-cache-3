40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to analyze the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> in an {{economics}} approach. If the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> occurs in a country, firms cannot import beef from it. The firms have some inventories to deal with the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk.</b> In this time, they decide to the level of inventories in relation to the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> probability. Of course, they also have to consider the level of inventory costs in addition to each firm sells rather substitutable products in the market. Hence, they totally evaluate the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> probability, inventory costs, and the strategies of rival firms. There are two main conclusions. First, the volume of inventories depends on the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> probability and inventory costs. For example, if the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> probability is low and inventory costs are high, the firm which faces with the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> has no inventories. Second, if the degree of homogeneity among products becomes high, the firm which faces with the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> reduces the inventories...|$|R

We are proposing to base importation conditions on the inherent <b>risk</b> of <b>BSE</b> infectivity in specified commodities, {{as well as on}} the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> status of the region from which the commodities originate. We are proposing to establish a system for classifying regions as to <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> that is consistent with the system employed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), the international standard-setting organization for guidelines related to animal health. The conditions we are proposing for the importation of specified commodities are based on internationally accepted scientific literature and, except in a few instances, are consistent with OIE guidelines. We are also proposing to classify certain specified countries as to <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> and are proposing to remove BSE restrictions on the importation of cervids and camelids and products derived from such animals. We are proposing to make these amendments afterconducting a thorough review of relevant scientific literature and a comprehensive evaluation of the issues and concluding that the proposed changes to the regulations would continue to guard against the introduction of BSE into the United States, while allowing the importation o...|$|R

40|$|Recently, due to {{consumers}} fears concerning BSE and vCJD, the need arose for methods to detect BSE, {{to estimate the}} present prevalence of BSE among cattle and to predict future BSE prevalence. As {{a part of that}} set of urgent questions, it has become important to indicate groups in which <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> is higher or lower. One of the well-known <b>risk</b> factors for <b>BSE</b> is age: very young animals do not develop the disease, and very old animals are less likely to develop the disease. Using age-structured modelling, three factors influencing the age distribution of BSE were found to be important: (1) the incubation period of BSE, (2) age structure of the cattle population, and (3) the local risk history (methods of rendering, feeding of compound feed containing Meat and Bone Meal (MBM), and the development of BSE control). The EU has considered these three risk factors {{to be the most important}} for <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> assessment. So far, this EU risk assessment method has been proven right by several countries detecting BSE after being classified as ‘BSE is most likely present here’. The age distribution of BSE seems to vary a lot between countries and regions. When information on these three factors is available, the expected age distribution of BSE in different countries can be calculated. Our calculations show that in countries where, until very recently, the reproduction ratio was high, (i. e., <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> factors were high), the BSE prevalence is expected to be highest in 4 -year-old cattle. In countries with low reproduction ratio for BSE, (i. e., BSE control at a very high level) for more than 5 years, the prevalence will be highest in the 6 – 8 -year-old cattle. Thus, surveillance could be targeted specifically at the age groups with the highest <b>BSE</b> <b>risk.</b> For each country, a short assessment shows in which age group BSE is most likely to be found...|$|R
40|$|After the {{discovery}} of variant Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), scientic advances quickly led to post-mortem tests to identify late-stage bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) disease. These were rst used in Switzerland in 1999 for active BSE surveillance of a) fallen and emergency-slaughter bovines (risk stock) and b) 5 % sample of routinely slaughtered cattle over 30 months of age. In 1999 and 2000, Switzerland’s estimated 103 BSE positives per 1 000 000 adult cattle {{put it in the}} same <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> classication as UK and Portugal. In July 2000, the European Union’s Scientic SteeringCommittee published its methodology (and rst vetted results) for geographical <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> (GBR) assessment in cattle. Member states with no BSE cases found themselves, on rational assessment, classied as GBR III (BSE likely but not conrmed, or conrmed at a lower level). Because of Europe’s thus highly assessed <b>BSE</b> <b>risks,</b> active <b>BSE</b> surveillance of adult cattle in all member states began in January 2001 using one of three validated post-mortem tests. Implementation was variable across member states in January to March 2001 but, where operational, active surveillance was typically achieved for around 13 300 routinely slaughtered and 1000 risk stock per month per 1 000 000 adult cattle; BSE positive rates were 60 and 600 per 1 000 000 routinely slaughtered and risk cattle, respectively.

40|$|Bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE), {{popularly known as}} 'mad cow disease', led to an epidemic in Europe that peaked in the mid- 1990 s.

The <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> to Nigeria's cattle population currently remains undetermined, which has resulted in international trade restrictions on commodities from the cattle population. This is mainly {{because of a lack of}} updated <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> assessments and disease surveillance data. To evaluate the feasibility of BSE surveillance in Nigeria, we carried out a pilot study targeting cattle that were presented for emergency or casualty slaughter. In total, 1551 cattle of local breeds, aged 24 months and above were clinically examined. Ataxia, recumbency and other neurological signs were topmost on our list of criteria. A total of 96 cattle, which correspond to 6. 2 %, presented clinical signs that supported a suspect of BSE. The caudal brainstem tissues of these animals were collected post-mortem and analysed for the disease-specific form of the prion protein using a rapid test approved by the International Animal Health Organization (OIE). None of the samples were positive for BSE. Although our findings do not exclude the presence of BSE in Nigeria, they do demonstrate that targeted sampling of clinically suspected cases of BSE is feasible in developing countries.

40|$|The {{total ban}} {{on use of}} meat and bone meal (MBM) in {{livestock}} feed has been very successful in reducing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) spread, but also implies a waste of high-quality proteins resulting in economic and ecological loss. Now that the BSE epidemic is fading out, a partial lifting of the MBM ban might be considered. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> for the Netherlands if MBM derived from animals fit for human consumption, i. e., category 3 MBM, would be used in nonruminant feed. A stochastic simulation model was constructed that calculates (1) the probability that infectivity of undetected BSE-infected cows ends up with calves and (2) the quantity of infectivity (Qinf) consumed by calves in case of such an incident. Three pathways were considered via which infectivity can reach cattle: (1) cross-contamination in the feed mill, (2) cross-contamination on the primary farm, and (3) pasture contamination. Model calculations indicate that the overall probability that infectivity ends up with calves is 3. 2 %. In most such incidents the Qinf is extremely small (median = 6. 5 × 10 ¿ 12 ID 50; mean = 1. 8 × 10 ¿ 4 ID 50), corresponding to an average probability of 1. 3 × 10 ¿ 4 that an incident results in ¿ 1 new BSE infections.

The age distribution of expected cases {{as well as the}} relative impact of different challenges is estimated. The model consists of a simple, transparent, and practical deterministic spreadsheet calculation model, in which the following country-specific inputs are entered: (i) annual imports of live cattle and meat and bone meal, (ii) age distribution of native cattle, and (iii) estimated annual basic reproduction ratio (R 0) for BSE. Results for Norway indicate that the highest <b>risk</b> of <b>BSE</b> cases was in 1989, when a total <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> of 0. 13 cases per year was expected. After that date, the year-to-year decrease in risk ranged between 3 % and 47 %, except for a secondary peak in 1994 at 0. 06 cases per year. The primary peak was almost entirely (99 %) attributable to the importation of 11 cattle from the United Kingdom between 1982 and 1986. The secondary peak, in 1994, originated mainly from the recycling of the U. K. imported cattle (92 %). In 2006, the remaining risk was 0. 0003 cases per year, or 0. 001 per million cows per year, with a maximal age-specific incidence of 0. 03 cases per million per year in 10 -year-old cattle.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} an insight from epidemiology and geography on the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk.</b> The epidemic declined sharply following the ban {{of meat and}} bone meal in ruminant feed. BSE cases born after the ban and reinforced measures were due to cross-contamination between feed for monogastrics and feed for ruminants at the feed factory and on farms. Cross-contamination is difficult to control in the feed chain, particularly because contaminated material can infect cattle at very low doses. Designing separate feed processing lines or dedicating factories to ruminants is an efficient strategy, but is not economically feasible in the regions with low animal density. So, changes in control measures should target both the feed industry and farmers, and {{take into account the}} difficult economic context that limits the industry's ability to adopt the most effective solutions to prevent cross-contaminatio...|$|R

40|$|Great Britain {{suffered}} two of {{the most}} globally notable animal disease epidemics of recent decades — the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) epidemic which began in November 1986, and the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemic which lasted from February to September 2001. This thesis applies various analytical techniques to these two quite different epidemics: a rapidly spreading highly contagious disease for which urgent decisions are essential (FMD), and a feed-borne non-contagious disease with an exceptionally long incubation period (BSE). The BSE epidemic, in particular, presented major investigational challenges because its recent emergence meant that its epidemiological features were not yet fully clear. The studies of BSE reported here showed that the control measures recommended {{as a consequence of the}} first epidemiological study of the new disease were remarkably effective. The July 1988 meat and bone meal ban resulted in a 60 % reduction in <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> for cattle born in the first 12 months after its introduction. Descriptive spatial analyses, using kernel density and regression techniques showed a marked concentration of <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> in the south of Great Britain. Following the July 1988 meat and bone meal ban <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> shifted to the east of the country, an effect partly explained by cross contamination of cattle feed with high-protein concentrates destined for the pig and poultry industry. Detailed investigation of the earliest BSE-exposed farm holdings identified the south of England as an area of excess exposure density. While interpretation of these findings is complicated by the fact that the disease must have been present for some years before it was first diagnosed, the evidence suggests initial amplification in the south provided risk material which progressively distributed the disease to the rest of the country. In contrast to BSE, FMD presents different challenges, in that affected farms can be diagnosed rapidly, but it is difficult to accurately evaluate the relative importance of the different mechanisms of transmission, and hence determine how best to apply control efforts. Foci of FMD infection of matched size in the English counties of Cumbria and Devon were compared to dissect out factors contributing to the two quite different epidemic patterns in these areas. This analysis showed evidence of strong spatio-temporal interaction of infection risk in Cumbria, due initially to cattle herds as the dominant influence, with a later growth in the role of sheep as a source of infection. During the FMD epidemic a stochastic spatial simulation model was used extensively as an aid for decision making. After the epidemic was over the predictive accuracy of earlier real-time modelling was assessed for the whole of Britain and the most concentrated focus of disease in Cumbria. The model predicted the temporal epidemic curve closely at both levels, and predicted the national spatial pattern of infection with high specificities (over 99 %) and useful sensitivities (37 % to 71 %). It was concluded that the model predicted FMD-infected locations within 0 to 14 days after simulation start date with sufficient accuracy to guide surveillance activities and to provide estimates of resources required for contingency planning. The spatial accuracy of predictions might be further improved through the use of a series of sub-regional models, better-capturing the characteristics of individual outbreak foci that typically emerge during extended large scale, multicentred epidemics. The studies presented in this thesis demonstrate that the application of temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal analytical methods can enhance the understanding of the epidermiological features of diseases in animal populations. The value in applying these methods of analysis comes from the ability to identify high and low disease-risk time frames and locations, allowing more focused allocation of investigative resources...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to measure and classify the international beef trade. For this, data related to the international chilled boneless beef (CBB) trade, the major and most important market, were analyzed. Producing countries were classified into groups according to their trade relations, and the main factors that influenced one country to prefer to import CBB from a specific exporting country were analyzed. The results revealed four markets related to client demands with regard to the sanitation and traceability of beef products. Furthermore, extrinsic characteristics of the product are discussed, such as a productive system that aims to minimize environmental impacts and to value animal welfare and respect for social demands. The markets that pay highest prices require sanitary quality of suppliers, demanding traceable and process-certified products.

40|$|The {{environment}} plays a {{key role}} in horizontal transmission of prion diseases, since prions are extremely resistant to classical inactivation procedures. In prior work, we observed the high stability of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) infectivity when these prions were incubated in aqueous media such as phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or wastewater for nearly nine months. As a continuation of this experiment, the same samples were maintained in PBS or wastewater for five additional years and <b>residual</b> <b>BSE</b> infectivity was assessed in bovine PrPC transgenic mice. Over this long time period (more than six years), BSE infectivity was reduced by three and one orders of magnitude in wastewater and PBS respectively. To rule out a possible agent specific effect, sheep scrapie prions were subjected to the same experimental protocol, using eight years as the experimental end-point. No significant reduction in scrapie infectivity was observed over the first nine months of wastewater incubation while PBS incubation for eight years only produced a two logarithmic unit reduction in infectivity. By contrast, the dynamics of PrPRes persistence was different, disappearing progressively over the first year. The long persistence of prion infectivity observed in this study for two different agents provides supporting evidence of the assumed high stability of these agents in aquatic environments and that environmental processes or conventional wastewater treatments with low retention times would have little impact on prion infectivity. These results could have great repercussions in terms of risk assessment and safety for animals and human populations...|$|R

Engel Curve analysis focusing on the dynamics of the monthly meat expenditure shares for a selected sample of 437 Canadian households for 2002 through 2005 is applied based on data on household expenditures for meat purchased by a national sample of Canadian households from the Nielsen Homescan® Canadian panel, supplemented by survey responses on <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> perceptions and measures of trust. Two sets of models are estimated: Engel curves in differences with instruments in levels and Engel curves in levels with instruments in differences. It is found that habit persistence limited households’ reductions of beef purchases following the first BSE event and that that trust limited households’ reduction in beef expenditure shares following the subsequent two BSE cases. Significant seasonal effects and a significant negative influence on beef expenditure shares are also found, consistent with the trend of declining consumption of beef in Canada since the late 1990 s.

40|$|International audienceUntil recently, {{epidemiological}} studies on Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) {{were based on}} Mandatory Reporting Systems (MRS) of clinically suspect bovines only, but rapid diagnostic tests were validated in 1999 and are used for targeted surveillance in Switzerland, France and other countries, as a complementary and secondary tool. Data on 30491 cattle issued from a French pilot program targeted at cattle having died on the farm, subjected to euthanasia or sent for emergency slaughter, did not show any significant difference in <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> between dairy and beef suckler breeds. The data also revealed {{that part of the}} clinical cases of BSE escaped the MRS, which permitted to detect more dairy than beef suckler affected cattle compared to the targeted surveillance in the same period (from August to December 2000) and region (Bretagne, Pays de la Loire and Basse Normandie regions). Analyzing together the data of the targeted surveillance and mandatory reporting system programs with a non-conditional logistic regression, we found that the odds of a dead cow being a BSE case among all dead cattle was 3. 2 times higher for dairy breeds compared to beef suckler breeds. This confirmed British findings but points out to the fact that considering either MRS or targeted surveillance data alone may possibly create biases in {{epidemiological studies}} on BSE...|$|R
40|$|Thank {{you very}} much for the {{opportunity}} to comment on the 2005 update of the Harvard <b>BSE</b> <b>Risk</b> Assessment which was released in July 2006. The combination of comprehensive surveillance and continual assessment are essential components of a program to monitor the trend of BSE in the US national herd and adjust policy accordingly. Measures taken throughout the past two decades have resulted in keeping the level of BSE in the United States at a very low level. It is important that we do not let our guard down and prematurely relax current regulations or not take additional necessary steps to maintain this status. I had the fortunate opportunity to work with Drs. George Gray, Joshua Cohen and Sylvia Kreindel on the original project as a Senior Staff Veterinarian for APHIS. After a review of this update I would like to comment on the following issues: Consideration of new research By the end of 2004 there was increasing evidence in species other than cattle that peripheral nerves and muscle have infectivity. In some of these species, studies indicate that the agent migrates to the brain and spinal cord, replicates to high levels in the central nervous system (CNS) and then spreads centrifugally from the spinal cord back down through the spinal neurons to the neuromuscular junction into the muscle cells themselves.

40|$|Until the {{pathogen}} of bovine spongiform encephalophathy (BSE) has been eradicated {{and as long}} as new infections are still possible, the removal of specified risk materials (SRMs) is the most effective way of protecting consumers from disease. SRM is the name given to poten-tial BSE-pathogen containing tissue like, for instance the brain, spinal cord and vertebral col-umn of cattle. To prevent SRM material reaching the food chain, it is removed directly after slaughter, dyed and not put to any further use. The specified risk materials that have to be removed depend on age at slaughter. In particular for the removal of the vertebral column as a specific risk material, the European Commission is currently planning to raise the age limit for all healthy, slaughtered cattle from 24 to 30 months. In a joint opinion, the Friedrich Loef-fler Institute (FLI) responsible for animal health and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) have assessed the EU proposal from the angle of its impact on consumer health pro-tection. According to FLI and BfR the age limit for the removal of the vertebral column as SRM should be raised to 30 months at the earliest in 2008. Assuming a mean incubation period for BSE of between five and six years and the full enforcement of the BSE protective measures introduced in December 2000 by 2002, then there will probably be no further risk of infection from the affected cattle by that time. The raising of the age limit from 2008 onwards would not, therefore, lead to any significant increase in the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk</b> for consumers...|$|R
40|$|The TSE Infectivity Model (TSEi), {{developed}} for EFSA by a contractor, allows: i) {{the comparison of}} the level of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) infectivity in animal tissues; ii) the estimation of the impact of risk management options (removal of specified risk material) at single animal level and at animal population (country) level; and iii) the estimation of the impact of processing on the TSE infectivity level. TSEi was developed in Microsoft Excel {{with the use of the}} stochastic add-in Palisade @Risk version 6. 2. 1., and is supported by a user-friendly interface that allows for the input of the various data and parameters needed. Two interfaces are provided: BSE in cattle (validated) and scrapie in sheep (not validated, provided for demonstration purposes). TSEi has been applied within an assessment of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy (<b>BSE)</b> <b>risk</b> in bovine intestines and mesentery, in particular to estimate the BSE infectious load in tissues from infected animals at different ages and the total yearly infectious load that could enter the food and feed chain in 27 European Union Member States (Adkin et al., 2014; EFSA BIOHAZ Panel, 2014). TSEi includes BSE data for two example countries (country MM, representing a medium-sized country with TSE testing started in 2003 and some BSE positive findings; country LL, representing a large-sized country with TSE testing started in 2002 and a high number of BSE positive findings). TSEi can be run with those fictitious data, or after inclusion of real data for any country of interest by the user...|$|R
40|$|The {{recent review}} (1) of bovine spongiform {{encephalopathy}} (BSE) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) stimulated {{a large number of}} questions and comments about additional issues discussed in this commentary. Advice for Travelers to Europe The most frequently asked question concerned travel to Europe this summer: what is safe to eat, and what should be avoided. In principle, beef and beef products should no longer carry any risk because the European Community, as well as individual European countries, have taken measures to prevent the entry of potentially contaminated products into the human food chain. These measures include regulations to end the recycling of mammalian protein into ruminant feed (extended by some countries to feed used for all mammalian species); removal of the heads and vertebral columns of slaughtered cattle before further processing; and prohibition of certain nervous system and visceral tissues for human consumption. In the United Kingdom, mechanically removed meat, even after removal of the vertebral column, is prohibited for human use. Nevertheless, because the extent of BSE outbreaks in most European countries is still not known—more and more cases are being discovered through active surveillance using sensitive immunologic tests—and because there is always an imprecise lead time before the implementation of precautionary measures, it would probably be wise to remain wary of beef products in continental European countries (and certain other countries) in which BSE already exists or is likely to appear, and in which safeguards may not yet be fully implemented.

40|$|A spatial {{analysis}} {{was carried out}} in order to analyse the reason why the risk of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) was spatially heterogeneous in France, during the period following the feed ban of Meat and Bone Meal to cattle. The hypothesis of cross-contamination between cattle feedstuff and monogastric feedstuff, which was strongly suggested from previous investigations, was assessed, with the assumption that the higher the pig or poultry density is in a given area, the higher the risk of cross-contamination and cattle infection might be. The data concerned the 467 BSE cases born in France after the ban of meat and bone meal (July 1990) and detected between July 1 st, 2001 and December 31, 2003, when the surveillance system was optimal and not spatially biased. The disease mapping models were elaborated with the Bayesian graphical modelling methods and based on a Poisson distribution with spatial smoothing (hierarchical approach) and covariates. The parameters were estimated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation method. The main result was that the poultry density did not significantly influence the <b>risk</b> of <b>BSE</b> whereas the pig density was significantly associated with an increase in the risk of 2. 4 % per 10 000 pigs. The areas with a significant pig effect were located in regions with a high pig density as well as a high ratio of pigs to cattle. Despite the absence of a global effect of poultry density on the <b>BSE</b> <b>risk,</b> some areas had a significant poultry effect and the risk was better explained in some others when considering both pig and poultry densities. These findings were in agreement with the hypothesis of cross-contamination, which could take place at the feedstuff factory, during the shipment of food or on the farm. Further studies are needed to more precisely explore how the cross-contamination happened...|$|R
