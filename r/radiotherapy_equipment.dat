40|$|AbstractAround 60 % of new cancer {{patients}} and 23 % of previously radiotherapy-treated patients need radiotherapy for management of their cancer. Although radiotherapy demands < 6 % of budget of cancer, huge initial out-lay makes it apparently expensive.

Improved precision of technological innovation has decreased the clinical adverse events albeit the questionable accuracy of dose delivered. However, new <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>equipments</b> are expensive, sophisticated and difficult to operate without any difference in survival. Novel technology has decreased access to radiotherapy in resource-constrained developing countries.

The aim of the current report is to describe {{the distribution}} of <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>equipment</b> in European countries. Methods: An 84 -item questionnaire was sent out to European countries, principally through their national societies. The current report includes a detailed analysis of radiotherapy departments and equipment (questionnaire items 26 29), analyzed in relation to the annual number of treatment courses and the socio-economic status of the countries. The analysis is based on validated responses from 28 of the 40 European countries defined by the European Cancer Observatory (ECO). Results: A large variation between countries was found for most parameters studied. There were 2192 linear accelerators, 96 dedicated stereotactic machines, and 77 cobalt machines reported in the 27 countries where this information was available. A total of 12 countries had at least one cobalt machine in use. There was a median of 0. 5 simulator per MV unit (range 0. 3 1. 5) and 1. 4 (range 0. 4 4. 4) simulators per department. Of the 874 simulators, a total of 654 (75 %) were capable of 3 D imaging (CT-scanner or CBCToption). The number of MV machines (cobalt, linear accelerators, and dedicated stereotactic machines) per million inhabitants ranged from 1. 4 to 9. 5 (median 5. 3) and the average number of MV machines per department from 0. 9 to 8. 2 (median 2. 6).

When completed, the final group work is presented to class and edited by the lecturer prior to revision for the unseen written exam. Relevance/Impact: Learning and teaching with group project work is vital to developing deep learning experiences, tying together clinical scenarios with academic depth; a must for therapeutic radiographers in clinical practice. Outcomes: Originally groups were chosen randomly throughout the cohort, now students at each clinical site research a particular topic – this has improved the evaluations having no negative comments regarding the group dynamics/ work.

AimTo present and compare the existing curricula of radiation technology in selected EU countries. Materials and methodsThe research work done {{for the purpose of}} the comparative analysis was based on the methods of diagnostic test and document analysis. ResultsThe comparison of curricula in selected countries, namely Austria, France, the Netherlands and Poland, showed that admission criteria to radiation technology courses are varied and depend on regulations of respective Ministries of Health. The most restrictive conditions, including written tests in biology, chemistry and physics, and psychometric test, are those in France. Contents of basic and specialist subject groups are very similar in all the countries. The difference is in the number of ECT points assigned to particular subjects and the number of course hours offered.

Tomographic imaging equipment is acquiring stacks of cross-sectional images, software implementations derive three-dimensional volumes from planar images to allow for visualization of reconstructed cross-sections at any orientation and location and higher-level visualization systems allow for transparent views and surface rendering. Of upcoming interest in radiotherapy is mutual information, the integration of information from multiple imaging equipment res. from the same imaging equipment at different time stamps and varying acquisition parameters. Huge amounts of images are acquired nowadays at radiotherapy centers, requiring organization of images with respect to patient, acquisition and equipment to allow for visualization of images in a comparative and integrative manner. Especially for integration of image information from different equipment, geometrical information is required to allow for registration of images res. volumes. DICOM 3. 0 has been introduced as a standard for information interchange with respect to medical imaging.

40|$|Editorial The usual {{external}} beam radiotherapy fractionation schedule consists of daily sessions five days a week, {{over a period of}} five to eight weeks. The current medical conduct is based on this periodicity, resulting in foreseeable healing and toxicity rates(1, 2).

The significance of radiotherapy interruption, either for treatment toxicity, tech-nical problems in equipment maintenance or breakdown, or for operational and socio-economic difficulties, is well documented in several scientific papers, reporting harm-ful effects on the treatments outcomes, especially in cases of highly prevalent tumors such as head & neck and uterine cervix cancers(1 – 3).

After natural radioactivity had been discovered and radium was used in medicine, the results were similar. The beginning of the 20 th century saw a growing interest in radiotherapy. First books were published summarising the knowledge in the field of X-ray therapy and <b>radiotherapy.</b> The technical <b>equipment,</b> however, was not good enough to enable irradiation of an appropriate quality, mainly in the case of deep tumours.

The present article summarizes key published work with particular emphasis on gliomas and medulloblastoma, the two commonly encountered tumors...|$|E
40|$|Tumors of the {{genitourinary}} system {{are one of}} the most common tumors encountered in clinical practice. The associated morbidity and mortality and the significant proportion of affected middle-age individuals have a major bearing on the death-adjusted life years compared to other malignancies. Genitourinary system tumors encompass a very broad spectrum with regard to age, location, histology, and clinical outcomes. Advances in diagnostic imaging, surgical techniques, <b>radiotherapy</b> <b>equipment,</b> and generation of newer chemotherapeutic and targeted agents over the past few years have helped improving treatment outcome. Several focused groups within India have been working on a range of topics related to {{genitourinary system}} tumors, and a significant body of work from India in the recent years is being increasingly recognized throughout the world. The present article summarizes the key published work related to the epidemiology of genitourinary system tumors in the Indian setting. A PubMed search was made for locating and selecting articles relevant to the topic...|$|E
