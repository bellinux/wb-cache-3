25|$|During the summer, National Park Service workers apply a {{pesticide}} to {{the tree}} to kill <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> mites (which can kill evergreen trees). The tree is also checked so that rodents do not take up residence in its roots or branches. The tree is pruned yearly, and fertilized every three years.|$|E
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are fond of}} cannas and {{can leave}} large holes in the leaves, preferring the tender young unfurled leaves. <b>Red</b> <b>spider</b> mites {{can also be a}} problem for cannas grown indoors or during a very hot, long summer outdoors. Japanese beetles can also ravage the leaves if left uncontrolled.|$|E
50|$|Insects are {{the biggest}} problem for centro plants. Pests include meloidae beetles, thrips, <b>red</b> <b>spiders,</b> bean flies and caterpillars. Centro is mostly {{unaffected}} by diseases, and tends {{not to have any}} major attacks 6. Fungal diseases that have previously affected centro include leaf spot, anthracnose and rhizoctonia blight and wilt. Simple solutions to prevent these pests and pathogens are slashing, and spot treatments with herbicides.|$|R

50|$|The {{land was}} hilly, rocky and infertile. None of Ford's {{managers}} had the requisite knowledge of tropical agriculture. In the wild, the rubber trees grow apart {{from each other}} as a protection mechanism against plagues and diseases, often growing close to bigger trees of other species for added support. In Fordl√¢ndia, however, the trees were closely together in plantations, easy prey for tree blight, sauva ants, lace bugs, <b>red</b> <b>spiders,</b> and leaf caterpillars,.|$|R
25|$|Slugs and snails {{are serious}} pests {{in some parts}} of the world, {{particularly}} in spring when new growth is emerging through the soil. Earwigs can also disfigure the blooms. The other main pests likely to be encountered are aphids (usually on young stems and immature flower buds), <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> mite (causing foliage mottling and discolouration, worse in hot and dry conditions) and capsid bugs (resulting in contortion and holes at growing tips). Diseases affecting dahlias include powdery mildew, grey mould (Botrytis cinerea), verticillium wilt, dahlia smut (Entyloma calendulae f. dahliae), phytophthora and some plant viruses. Dahlias are a source of food for the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including angle shades, common swift, ghost moth and large yellow underwing.|$|E
25|$|Chrysoperla carnea adults eat pollen and {{honeydew}} {{and are not}} predatory, but {{the larvae}} have been recorded as feeding on seventy different prey species in five insect orders. The prey are mostly from the order Hemiptera and are predominantly aphids on low growing vegetation. On crops, the larvae have been reported as attacking several species of aphids, <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> mites, thrips, whitefly, the eggs of leafhoppers, leaf miners, psyllids, small moths and caterpillars, beetle larvae and the tobacco budworm. They {{are considered to be}} important predators of the long-tailed mealybug under glass. C. carnea occurs naturally in many growing regions of the northern hemisphere. It is considered an important aphid predator in cotton crops in Russia and Egypt, sugar beet in Germany and vineyards in Europe. It {{has been found to be}} effective at controlling the cotton whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, in cotton crops in Pakistan. The presence of the larvae on the foliage was found to inhibit visitation and oviposition by B. tabaci which suggests the larvae may produce a volatile semiochemical which repels the whitefly.|$|E

500|$|A {{range of}} pests attack cacti in cultivation. Those that feed on sap include: mealybugs, living on both stems and roots; scale insects, {{generally}} only found on stems; whiteflies, which {{are said to}} be an [...] "infrequent" [...] pest of cacti; <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> mites, which are very small but can occur in large numbers, constructing a fine web around themselves and badly marking the cactus via their sap sucking, even if they do not kill it; and thrips, which particularly attack flowers. Some of these pests are resistant to many insecticides, although there are biological controls available. Roots of cacti can be eaten by the larvae of sciarid flies and fungus gnats. Slugs and snails also eat cacti.|$|E
500|$|In {{creating}} the visual look for Miles, Pichelli followed her usual practice of approaching the design by giving {{thought to the}} character's personality, including the background that influenced it, and the distinctive traits that he would exhibit, such as the clothing he wears, his body language and expressions. Pichelli also designed Spider-Man's new costume, a mostly black outfit with red webbing and a <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> logo. Pichelli had worked on four issues of Ultimate Spider-Man before she was approached {{to work on the}} new title with Miles Morales. Pichelli, who works with a Cintiq 12wx graphic tablet, added more screentones to her illustrations to give what she called [...] "a more 'pop' feeling to the book", which she felt would be fitting to the series.|$|E

6000|$|... "Nothing {{that resembles}} it. At a future time I will examine what man calls {{his mind and}} give you the details of that chaos, then you will see and understand. Men {{have nothing in common}} with me--there is no point of contact; they have foolish little {{feelings}} and foolish little vanities and impertinences and ambitions; their foolish little life is but a laugh, a sigh, and extinction; and they have no sense. Only the Moral Sense. I will show you what I mean. Here is a <b>red</b> <b>spider,</b> not so big as a pin's head. Can you imagine an elephant being interested in him--caring whether he is happy or isn't, or whether he is wealthy or poor, or whether his sweetheart returns his love or not, or whether his mother is sick or well, or whether he is looked up to in society or not, or whether his enemies will smite him or his friends desert him, or whether his hopes will suffer blight or his political ambitions fail, or whether he shall die in the bosom of his family or neglected and despised in a foreign land? These things can never be important to the elephant; they are nothing to him; he cannot shrink his sympathies to the microscopic size of them. Man is to me as the <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> is to the elephant. The elephant has nothing against the spider--he cannot get down to that remote level; I have nothing against man. The elephant is indifferent; I am indifferent. The elephant would not take the trouble to do the spider an ill turn; if he took the notion he might do him a good turn, if it came in his way and cost nothing. I have done men good service, but no ill turns.|$|E
6000|$|Not that I care, or esteem birds {{for what}} they eat or do not eat. With all these creatures that are at strife among themselves, and that birds prey upon, I am at peace, even to the {{smallest}} that are visible--the <b>red</b> <b>spider</b> which is no spider; and the minute gossamer spider clinging to the fine silvery hairs of the flying summer; and the coccus that fall from the fruit trees to float on their buoyant cottony down--a summer snow. Fils de la Vierge are these, and sacred. The man who can needlessly set his foot on a worm is as strange to my soul as De Quincey's imaginary Malay, or even his [...] "damned crocodile." [...] The worm that one sees lying bruised and incapable on the gravel walk has fallen among thieves. These little lives do me good and not harm. I smell the acid ants to strengthen my memory. I know that if I set an overturned cockchafer on his legs three sins shall be forgiven me; that if I am kindly tolerant of the spider that drops accidentally on my hand or face, my purse shall be mysteriously replenished. At the same time, one has to remember that such sentiments, as a rule, are not understood {{by those who have}} charge over groves and gardens, whose minds are ignorant and earthy, or, as they would say, practical. Of the balance of nature they know and care naught, nor can they regard life as sacred; it is enough to know that it is or may be injurious to their interests for them to sweep it away. The small thing that has been flying about and uttering musical sounds since April may, when July comes, devour a certain number of cherries. Nor is even this plea needed. If it is innocent for the lower creatures to prey upon one another, it cannot be less innocent for man to destroy them indiscriminately, if it gives him any pleasure to do so. It is idle to go into such subtle questions with those who have the power to destroy; if their hands are to be restrained it is not by appealing to feelings which they do not possess, but to their lower natures--to their greed and their cunning. For the rest of us, for all who have conquered or outgrown the killing instinct, the impartiality that pets nothing and persecutes nothing is doubtless man's proper attitude towards the inferior animals; a godlike benevolent neutrality; a keen and kindly interest in every form of life, with indifference as to its ultimate destiny; the softness which does no wrong with the hardness that sees no wrong done.|$|E
