5|$|A Chinese study {{published}} in 2001 used the molecular biological technique <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> to analyze the differences in DNA sequence between 23 A.gallica specimens collected from the Northern Hemisphere. The results suggest that based on the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> patterns observed, there are four global A.gallica subpopulations: the Chinese, European, North American–Chinese, and North American–European geographical lineages. A 2007 study on the northeastern and southwestern Chinese distribution of Armillaria, using fruit body and pure culture morphology, concluded that there are several unnamed species (Chinese biological species C, F, H, J and L) {{that are similar to}} the common A.gallica.|$|E
5|$|Definitive {{laboratory}} {{identification of}} variola virus involves growing the virus on chorioallantoic membrane (part of a chicken embryo) and examining the resulting pock lesions under defined temperature conditions.

5|$|Another species {{analysed}} in Gulden's 2001 study, Galerina pseudomycenopsis, {{also could}} not be distinguished from G.marginata based on ribosomal DNA sequences and <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> analyses. Because of differences in ecology, fruit body color and spore size combined with inadequate sampling, the authors preferred to maintain G.pseudomycenopsis as a distinct species. A 2005 study again failed to separate the two species using molecular methods, but reported that the incompatibility demonstrated in mating experiments suggests that the species are distinct.|$|E

40|$|Fibrocalculous {{pancreatic}} diabetes (previously {{known as}} tropical pancreatic diabetes) {{is a rare}} cause of diabetes confined to countries within the tropical belt. The aetiology of fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes {{is thought to be}} environmental although the agent(s) is unknown. We have investigated a possible genetic basis of this disease by looking for <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> of genes implicated in the aetiology of diabetes mellitus. Seventy-six Dravidian patients with fibrocalculous pancreatic diabetes were studied, and the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> obtained compared to racially matched control subjects (n = 94), patients with Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes (n = 87) and Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes (n = 58).

5|$|Rolf Singer's fourth edition (1986) of his {{comprehensive}} Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy included Collybia racemosa {{in section}} Collybia, {{in addition to}} the three species that currently comprise the genus Collybia: C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei. A phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer sequences of ribosomal DNA by Karen Hughes and colleagues showed that C.tuberosa, C.cirrhata and C.cookei form a monophyletic group within a larger Lyophyllum–Tricholoma–Collybia clade that includes several species of Lyophyllum, Tricholoma, Lepista, Hypsizygus and the species C.racemosa. Hughes and colleagues could not identify a clade that included all four species of Collybia. <b>Restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> analysis of the ribosomal DNA from the four species corroborated the results obtained from phylogenetic analysis. Based on these results, as well as differences in characteristics such as the presence of unique stem projections, fruit body pigmentation, and macrochemical reactions, they circumscribed the new genus Dendrocollybia to contain C.racemosa.|$|E
25|$|Samples from bloody shoe prints leading {{away from}} the bodies and from the back gate of the {{condominium}} were tested for DNA matches. Initial polymerase chain reaction testing did not rule out Simpson as a suspect. In more precise <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> tests, matches were found between Simpson's blood and blood samples taken {{from the crime scene}} (both the shoe prints in blood and the gate samples). Police criminalist Dennis Fung testified that this DNA evidence put Simpson at Brown's townhouse {{at the time of the}} murders. But defense expert Barry Scheck conducted an eight-day cross-examination, questioning most of the DNA evidence. Dr. Robin Cotton, of Cellmark Diagnostics, testified for six days. Blood evidence had been tested at two separate laboratories, each conducting different tests. At this time, the general population was still unfamiliar with the precision and significance of DNA matching.|$|E
25|$|The species Trypanosoma brucei, {{which causes}} the disease, {{has often been}} {{subdivided}} into three subspecies that were identified based either on the vertebrate hosts which the strain could infect or on the virulence of the disease in humans. The trypanosomes infectious to animals and not to humans were named Trypanosoma brucei brucei. Strains that infected humans {{were divided into two}} subspecies based on their different virulences: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense was thought to have a slower onset and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense refers to strains with a more rapid, virulent onset. This characterization has always been problematic but was the best that could be done given the knowledge of the time and the tools available for identification. A recent molecular study using <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> analysis suggests that the three subspecies are polyphyletic, so the elucidation of the strains of T. brucei infective to humans requires a more complex explanation. Procyclins are proteins developed in the surface coating of trypanosomes whilst in their tsetse fly vector.|$|E

40|$|A genetic {{analysis}} of diabetic and non-diabetic Punjabi Sikhs (n = 164) {{was made for}} markers of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus using insulin receptor, insulin, and HLA-D alpha chain gene probes. Additionally British Caucasoids (n = 163) were studied using the insulin receptor probe. Insulin receptor gene <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> were defined using Southern blot techniques and the restriction enzyme Bgl II and BAm Hl. In Punjabi Sikhs and British Caucasoids neither of the <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphisms</b> distinguished non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus subjects from controls. In the Sikhs no association with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was seen with the hypervariable region of the insulin gene or with HLA-DR/DQ/DX alpha chain <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphisms.</b> We therefore conclude that despite the high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus in Asians {{we were unable to}} find any genetic markers for this disease using the available cloned gene probes...|$|R
500|$|Morchella sextelata was {{originally}} identified as phylogenetic species [...] "Mel-6" [...] in the species-rich Elata clade (brown morels) elucidated by microbiologist Kerry O'Donnell and colleagues in a 2011 publication. The specific epithet sextelata alludes to this preliminary name. Although M.sextelata is not distinguishable from Morchella septimelata on physical or ecological characteristics, {{they are clearly}} genetically distinct species, and can be differentiated by comparing DNA sequences or with <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> analysis. Allopatric speciation {{is thought to have}} been the driving evolutionary force that caused M.sextelata to diverge from its ancestors roughly 25 million years ago.

500|$|Researchers {{reported}} finding Armillaria gallica in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in {{the early}} 1990s, during an unrelated research project to study the possible biological effects of extremely low frequency radio stations, which were being investigated {{as a means to}} communicate with submerged submarines. In one particular forest stand, Armillaria-infected oak trees had been harvested, and their stumps were left to rot in the field. Later, when red pines were planted in the same location, the seedlings were killed by the fungus, identified as A.gallica (then known as A.bulbosa). Using molecular genetics, they determined that the underground mycelia of one individual fungal colony covered , weighing over , with an estimated age of 1,500 years. The analysis used <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> (RFLP) and random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) to examine isolates collected from fruit bodies and rhizomorphs (underground aggregations of fungal cells that resemble plant roots) along [...] transects in the forest. The 15-hectare area yielded isolates that had identical mating type alleles and mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment patterns; this degree of genetic similarity indicated that the samples were all derived from a single genetic individual, or clone, that had reached its size through vegetative growth. In their conclusion the authors noted: [...] "This is the first report estimating the minimum size, mass, and age of an unambiguously defined fungal individual. Although the number of observations for plants and animals is much greater, members of the fungal kingdom should now be recognized as among the oldest and largest organisms on earth." [...] After the Nature paper was published, major media outlets from around the world visited the site where the specimens were found; {{as a result of this}} publicity, the individual acquired the common name [...] "humongous fungus". There was afterward some scholarly debate as to whether the fungus qualified to be considered in the same category as other large organisms such as the blue whale or the giant redwood.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{present in}} Dolichopteryx, Opisthoproctus, and Winteria species {{are a number}} of {{luminous}} organs; [...] Dolichopteryx has several along the length of its belly, and [...] Opisthoproctus has a single organ {{in the form of a}} rectal pouch. These organs glow with a weak light due to the presence of symbiotic bioluminescent bacteria, specifically, Photobacterium phosphoreum (family Vibrionaceae). The ventral surfaces of Opisthoproctus species are characterised by a flattened and projecting 'sole'; in the mirrorbelly (Opisthoproctus grimaldii) and Opisthoproctus soleatus, this sole may act as a reflector, by directing the emitted light downwards. The strains of P. phosphoreum present in the two Opisthoproctus species have been isolated and cultured in the lab. Through <b>restriction</b> <b>fragment</b> <b>length</b> <b>polymorphism</b> analysis, the two strains have been shown to differ only slightly.|$|E
