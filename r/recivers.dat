40|$|Diploma {{presents}} relativistic eﬀects on GPS observations. First {{and second}} chapter are a short introduction to special and {{general theory of}} relativity, where notions of proper time, Lorentz transform, tensor and manifold are presented. Famous Einstein ﬁeld equations follow and I give a brief explanation of physical backgroung. A detailed derivation of Doppler eﬀect and proper time equations in Schwartzschild metric follows, which are then used in connection with satellite and <b>reciver,</b> where the <b>reciver</b> {{is supposed to be}} placed on geoid. An important chapter on clock synchronisation is also included, methods described there are important in construction of coordinate time. Last chapter deals with code and phase observations, and an important conclusion is that relativistic eﬀects on these two diﬀerent types of observations are basically the same...|$|R
40|$|Abstract- For a {{closed-loop}} transmit (Tx) diversity, the Tx weights {{are calculated}} at a <b>reciver,</b> and fed {{back to a}} transmitter. As the number of Tx antennas increases, the potential gain of closed-loop Tx diversity may be significant. However, the amount of feedback information linearly increases, and the performance improvement of a closed-loop Tx diversity system {{may not be as}} significant as expected due to delay in feedback process. Thus, an efficient Tx weight representation, which can reduce the amount of feedback information, is needed. In this paper, a Tx weight vector representation is presented, and its performance is analyzed. I...|$|R
40|$|Improved {{communication}} {{is part of}} the agile solution to the problems we have in developing software. It has been shown that some development practices restricted feedback within teams because empirical studies suggest that {{a significant portion of the}} software maintainer's time is required to understand the functionality of the software to be maintained. Muller and Padberg demonstrated that when developers work together as tightly knit pairs this changes as their productivity and feelgood increase. In this paper we report on observations of developers programming as a pair. We see that the management of face is an important factor in attempts to <b>reciver</b> the meaning of code...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} whether {{the use of}} a noiseless, classical feedback channel will increase the capacity of a quantum discrete memoryless channel to transmit classical information. This problem has been previously analyzed by Bowen and Nagarajan [2] for the case of protocols restricted to product input states. They showed that feedback did not increase the information capacity. In this paper we introduce a quantum analogue of classical causality [11],[15] and prove a capacity theorem (in regularized form) for the transmission of classical information. In classical information theory a noiseless feedback channel between sender and <b>reciver</b> will not increase the Shannon capacity of a channel. In the quantum case, the situation is more complex because there are number of possible feedback capacities corresponding to any channel: the simplest o...|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} {{on the development of}} a high-temperature ceramic heat exchanger element to be integrated into a solar <b>reciver</b> producing heated air. A number of conceptual designs were developed for heat exchanger elements of differing configuration. These were evaluated with respect to thermal performance, pressure drop, structural integrity, and fabricability. The final design selection identified a finned ceramic shell as the most favorable concept. The ceramic shell is surrounded by a larger metallic shell. The flanges of the two shells are sealed to provide a leak-tight pressure vessel. The ceramic shell is fabricated by an innovative combination of slip casting the receiver walls and precision casting the heat transfer finned plates. The fins are bonded to the shell during firing. Fabrication of a one-half scale demonstrator ceramic receiver has been completed...|$|R

40|$|Today many {{shooting}} ranges uses outdated {{systems for}} controlling their shooting targets. These systems may be inconvenient to both use and to program. During this project {{a new system}} for controlling shooting targets is developed, togheter with a rotation target prototype for air pistol shooting. The project aims to allow more members to easily {{learn how to use}} and to program their system. A system that is easy to use will also free more time for a shooting leader to superintend the shooters. The core part of the system is its <b>reciver,</b> which is epuipped with a Bluetooth Low Energy module to establish a connection with a remote handheld device. Both the reciever and rotation target prototype is developed. Different strategies for meeting the specified requirements are evaluated. The result is a system that recievs a program sequence from a handheld unit and controls the rotation target prototype as specified by the user...|$|R
40|$|Abstract [...] -Steganography {{is the art}} {{and science}} of writing hidden {{messages}} {{in such a way}} that no one, apart from the sender and anticipated <b>reciver,</b> imagine the existence of the information, a form of security through obscurity. It is an emerging area which is used for secured data broadcast over any public media. In this study a novel advance of image steganography based on LSB (Least Significant Bit) insertion, RSA encryption and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard Algorithm) technique for the lossless jpeg images has been proposed. In this paper, we present a strategy of attaining maximum embedding ability in an image in a way that maximum possible neighboring pixels are analyzed for their frequencies, to determine the amount of content to be added in each pixel. The techniques provide a seamless insertion of data into the carrier image and reduce the error consideration and artifacts insertion required to a minimal. We validate our approach with the help of an experimental evaluation on a prototypic implementation of the proposed model...|$|R
40|$|We are {{developing}} a solar process for producing magnesium (Mg) from magnesium oxide (MgO) via electrolysis in a molten salt. Magensium is a valuable commodity with an increasing demand currently produced in fossil fuel and electric energy intensive processes that significantly contribute to global climate change. Our process reduces the electric energy required by operating at high temperature and also displaces electric energy with solar thermal energy, mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. In order to effectively deliver the solar thermal energy to the MgO electrolysis process, we propose the Active Reflux Sodium Heat Pipe Receiver. In this concept, sodium is evaporated by high-flux solar radiation {{at the top of}} a power tower. The sodium vapor then flows to the ground to the electrolytic cells where it condenses, liberating the heat of vaporaziation to heat the cells. The condensed sodium is then pumped back to the tower and reused for continued heating. We are testing the concept of the Active Reflux Sodium Heat Pipe Receiver using a laboratory-scale 5 kW receiver and the VALPO solar furnace. Our tests focus on developing the heat pipe-electrolytic cell interface. We thus are using conventional sodium heat pipes in which the sodium flows by gravity to avoid the need to actively pump the sodium. In this study, we develop a numerical model for the heat transfer in the solar <b>reciver.</b> The model uses a finite volume method to solve for the distribution of temperature throughout the receiver. The purpose of this model is to determine (1) the time it takes the heat pipes to reach operating temperature of 1400 K, (2) the rate of heat transfer through the heat pipes, and (3) the thermal efficiency of the receiver. The model predicts a heat up time of three minutes for the heat pipes to reach 1400 K. The resulting rate of heat transfer through the heat pipes to the outside air is 298 W. The thermal efficiency of the receiver, defined as the fraction of solar thermal input that is transferred through the heat pipe to the electrolysis cell is low while the receiver heats up as most of the solar energy is utilized for heating. At steady-state, the receiver efficiency is greater than 15 %. The thermal efficiency is expected to increase with additional heat pipes...|$|R
