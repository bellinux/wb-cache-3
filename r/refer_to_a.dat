The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. The marine chronometer would {{have to keep the}} time of a fixed location—usually Greenwich Mean Time—allowing seafarers to determine longitude by comparing the local high noon to the clock. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of motte-and-bailey castles were built outside of {{northern}} Europe.

The Italians came to <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> range of different castle types as motta, however, and there {{may not have been}} as many genuine motte-and-bailey castles in southern Italy as was once thought {{on the basis of the}} documentary evidence alone.

5|$|From their {{beginnings}} to {{the present}} day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those {{coming up in the}} profession and others whose careers are waning.

Some actors, such as Bela Lugosi, Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term B actor is sometimes used to <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.|$|E

Shāriʿ itself {{can also be used to}} <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> legislator or lawgiver, and when used with the definite article al- in a religious context is a reference to God as the source of all religious law.|$|E

The majority of the petrographs found here are abstract figures. The colours red, black and white dominate the rock paintings in Sáchica. The black has been analysed also at El Infiernito and is though to <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> pre-Muisca origin. Radial structures drawn on {{the heads of the}} anthropomorphic petrographs are interpreted as feathers. Feathers were precious objects for the Muisca and used by the xeques and caciques during the El Dorado ritual in Lake Guatavita.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{provides}} {{background on}} the development of the term brainwashing, from its use in 1950 by journalist Edward Hunter and its later usage as applied to the spheres of cults, marketing, influence, thought reform, torture, and reeducation. She references psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton's work Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism as a resource throughout the book. Lifton based his research on interviews he conducted with prisoners of war who had been subjected to indoctrination and torture during the Korean War. Taylor argues that the term brainwashing is useful to when used to <b>refer</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more coercive form of persuasion.|$|E
