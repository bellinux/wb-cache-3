Two types of boundaries, assigned to coherent twin and <b>random</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries, were studied in three different states of the copper surface: metallic after cathodic reduction of the air-formed native oxide film, passive after anodic polarization at 0. 7 V vs. SHE to form the duplex Cu(I) /Cu(II) oxide film, and metallic after cathodic reduction of the passive film. The depth measured at several sites along the grain boundaries was extracted from statistical line profile analysis and discussed using an original model allowing differentiating metal consumption by dissolution or by passive film formation at grains and grain boundaries. The results highlight different local passivation properties between randomly oriented grains and grain boundaries and also between the {{two different types of}} grain boundaries. Both at coherent twin and <b>random</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries, it is found that more copper irreversibly dissolves during passivation and less copper is consumed to grow the passive film, suggesting a more hydroxylated/hydrated composition less dense in copper than on grains.

40|$|AbstractThe {{intergranular}} fracture promoted by hydrogen ingress {{in the material}} depends on densities and organizations of defects near grain boundaries. Particularly, we illustrate first {{the relation between the}} grain boundary character and the different defects and trapping sites stored, and their consequences on hydrogen transport and segregation. High-angle Random boundaries (R) are considered as a disorganized phase where the hydrogen diffusion is accelerated, while the Special boundaries (Coincident Site Lattice, CSL) constitute a potential zone for hydrogen trapping due to the high density of trapping sites as dislocations and vacancies. The predominance of one phenomenon depends on several parameters, such as the grain size, the probability of grain boundaries connectivity, the grain boundaries energy and the excess of free volume. Additionally, our experiments confirm that hydrogen promotes vacancies formation, probably in grain boundaries. In a second part, we have explored the role of the <b>Random</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries on damage assisted by hydrogen. Tensile strengthening is reduced under hydrogen flux when the fraction of <b>random</b> <b>grain</b> boundaries increases.

It is shown that overall cyclic hardening is accompanied by a significant increase in strain dispersion. The case of free-standing films is also addressed for comparison.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we faced {{the problem of}} {{building}} a realistic stochastic geometric model for ferrite-martensite dual phase steel, based {{on the availability of}} about 150 sections of one sample of the material. After a morphological analysis of the given real sample, we proposed a germ-grain model with germs scattered around some nucleation planes, and spherical <b>random</b> <b>grains,</b> depending on a set of 11 unknown parameters. Since the distribution of the random variables involved in the model are very difficult to be theoretically retrieved, classical statistical methods for parameters estimation, like maximum likelihood, could not be applied to this case. Thus we based our parameter estimation technique on the minimization of a suitable distance (the N-distance) between the Minkowski functionals of the real data and the mean of the simulated data. This choice was motivated {{by the fact that the}} Minkowski functionals characterize the morphology of a random set. Two different ways to estimate the Minkowski functionals have been tested and the best method (that is the one described in Case 1, in Section  5) has been selected, on the basis of a comparison between the results of the simulations of the model and the real data. The model validation has been performed by building confidence bands and functional boxplots for the Minkowski functionals.|$|R

These include randomly shaped and oriented crystal grains and strongly orientation dependent deformation behavior of the grains. The goal of our work is to propose computational models aiming to quantify the effects of <b>random</b> <b>grain</b> orientations on the variability of crack tip opening and sliding displacements (CTOD, CTSD). A Voronoi tessellation based computational model has been developed to simulate the <b>random</b> <b>grain</b> structure. The constitutive behavior of individual grains includes randomly oriented anisotropic elasticity and crystal plasticity (where Schmid resolved stress is taken into account). The equilibrium equations are solved with macroscopic boundary conditions at the scale of the component using commercially available finite element solver ABAQUS. The stationary crack configurations studied include transgranular crack extending through about half of a crystal grain, a series of cracks of different sizes simulating the short crack approaching and crossing the first grain boundary and a series of cracks with different lengths extending from one to over a few grains. The FCC material with properties representing industry grade austenitic stainless steel is assumed with macroscopic uniaxial loading approaching macroscopic yield strength of the material. Sufficiently many simulations with different <b>random</b> <b>grain</b> orientations have been performed to arrive at approximate cumulative probability distributions of the CTOD and CTSD. Possible limits of the CTOD/CTSD variability, as for example those derived from a large monocrystal with variable lattice orientations with respect to the crack and from the linear elastic fracture mechanics, are given and discussed. Discussion includes identification of at least two main sources of the CTOD/CTSD variability: grain structure and strain localizations extending over the entire computational domain. Also, the attempt is made to quantify the decreasing influence of the grain structure with increasing crack length. The current computational model is limited to an essentially planar model (plane strain) with lattice rotations around the out of plane axis only. This basically allows for limiting most of the slip to two active (inplane) slip systems. The reason for this is the computational intensity of the simulations.

SnO 2 SnO 2 thin films with randomly oriented nanosized grains were obtained by annealing an amorphous SnO film deposited at room temperature. Films with nanosized SnO 2 SnO 2 laminates were obtained by annealing epitaxial α-SnO films deposited at 600  °C. The laminates are oriented with their (101) planes parallel to the substrate surface and have a high density of coherent twin boundaries. Hall measurements indicate that the electron concentration of the film with laminate grains is much lower than for the film with <b>random</b> <b>grains.</b> It is proposed that the high density twin boundaries inside the laminates trap conducting electrons and significantly reduce the electron concentration.
