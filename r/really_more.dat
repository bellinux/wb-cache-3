5|$|We {{really wanted}} to do {{something}} that just shows who I am. We weren't trying to make a better version of myself. It was <b>really</b> <b>more</b> about fun and being spontaneous. All of the mistakes were allowed to be there, which was the same for the song. The way that the song was recorded was very live. We played everything live, we didn't stop to edit ourselves, it was very intuitive and I wanted the video to have that energy, as well.|$|E
5|$|With Twitter, it wasn't {{clear what}} it was. They {{called it a}} social network, they called it microblogging, {{but it was hard}} to define, because it didn't replace anything. There was this path of {{discovery}} with something like that, where over time you figure out what it is. Twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning, which we described as status updates and a social utility. It is that, in part, but the insight we eventually came to was Twitter was <b>really</b> <b>more</b> of an information network than it is a social network.|$|E
5|$|As Buoso Donati lies {{dead in his}} curtained four-poster bed, his {{relatives}} gather round to mourn his passing, but are <b>really</b> <b>more</b> interested in learning {{the contents of his}} will. Among those present are his cousins Zita and Simone, his poor-relation brother-in-law Betto, and Zita's nephew Rinuccio. Betto mentions a rumour he has heard that Buoso has left everything to a monastery; this disturbs the others and precipitates a frantic search for the will. The document is found by Rinuccio, who is confident that his uncle has left him plenty of money. He withholds the will momentarily and asks Zita to allow him to marry Lauretta, daughter of Gianni Schicchi, a newcomer to Florence. Zita replies that if Buoso has left them rich, he can marry whom he pleases; she and the other relatives are anxious to begin reading the will. A happy Rinuccio sends little Gherardino to fetch Schicchi and Lauretta.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} series began, Kansas City Mayor Sly James issued a {{challenge}} to Toronto Mayor John Tory over {{the result of the}} series, stating, “we are going to not lose, so I’m <b>really</b> <b>more</b> interested in what you’re going to do for us. I will warn you in advance, we have our own maple syrup, so something else maybe.” He wagered a selection of ribs and sauces from three local restaurants, while Tory responded the next day with a wager of three types of Toronto craft-brewed beer.|$|E
25|$|In a 2015 {{retrospective}} on Kuhn, {{the philosopher}} Martin Cohen describes {{the notion of}} the ‘Paradigm Shift’ as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what it might mean and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never <b>really</b> <b>more</b> than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E

25|$|Though {{the details}} of his {{professional}} life are widely known, Eltinge's personal life is shrouded in mystery; mystery partly due to the passage of time, but <b>really</b> <b>more</b> likely to Eltinge's own hand. Eltinge was born in Newtonville, Massachusetts to Julia Edna Baker and Joseph Dalton. It is believed that his father was a mining engineer and that early in his life he traveled out west with his father, ending up in Butte, Montana. In his early teens, Eltinge dressed in women's clothing and performed in the rugged saloons patronized by ranchers and miners. Upon discovering this in 1899, his father beat him and his mother sent him back to Boston, where the 17-year-old worked in dry goods as a salesman while studying dance.|$|E
500|$|Stephens recalled: [...] "Radio City, for me, {{was just}} an amazing record. Being a three-piece really opened things up for me in terms of playing drums. Drums take on a {{different}} role in a three-piece band, {{so it was a}} lot of fun. [...] Radio City was <b>really</b> <b>more</b> spontaneous, and the performances were pretty close to live performances." ...|$|E

Still, that's all some films require ..." ...|$|E

500|$|... "We {{needed someone}} to play {{keyboards}} for a song I did with Gavin Christopher. We called someone and he couldn't come, so by accident we stumbled on Ben.

500|$|Some critics, such as James Berardinelli, saw a {{fundamental}} {{weakness in the}} film: the [...] "overemphasis on story may be a mistake, because {{there are times when}} Licence to Kills narrative bogs down." [...] Berardinelli gave the film three out of a possible four stars, adding [...] "Licence to Kill may be taut and gripping, but it's not traditional Bond, and that, as much as any other reason, may explain the public's rejection of this reasonably well-constructed picture." [...] Raymond Benson, the author of nine Bond novels, said of the film: [...] "It boggles my mind that Licence to Kill is so controversial. There's <b>really</b> <b>more</b> of a true Ian Fleming story in that script than in most of the post-60s Bond movies." [...] John Glen has said Licence to Kill [...] "is among my best Bond films, if not the best".|$|E
500|$|Taking Back Sunday {{rented a}} room in Manhattan, sharing it with the Sleeping and writing songs with laptops and guitars. Typically, they arrived at about 10 am; some evenings, Lazzara showed up after the band to write melodies. The group wrote 20 songs before {{discarding}} half, and recorded 14 or 15 demos in their home studio. According to bassist Matt Rubano, Fred Mascherino and Adam Lazzara's lyrics [...] "are coming into a golden age. The tracks are <b>really</b> <b>more</b> rocking and we’re trying some new things, but it’s still us." [...] Like Where You Want to Be, the band pushed themselves to write the best songs they could. For Where You Want to Be the group [...] "didn’t {{spend as much time}} playing together," [...] but for Louder Now [...] "we know each other’s playing. We know what we want and don’t want." ...|$|E

500|$|McCain easily won {{re-election}} {{to a third}} senate term in November 1998, gaining 69percent of {{the vote}} to 27percent for his Democratic opponent, environmental lawyer Ed Ranger. [...] Ranger was a motorcycle enthusiast whose Harley-Davidson was painted as the flag of Arizona and a political novice who had only recently returned from four years of working and living in Mexico. [...] McCain carried Democratic stronghold Apache County by 54–42percent and won Hispanic votes statewide by 52–42percent. [...] McCain took no [...] "soft money" [...] during the campaign, but still raised $4.4 million for his bid, {{saying that he had}} needed it in case the tobacco companies or other Washington special interests mounted a strong effort against him. [...] One of Ranger's campaigning points had been that McCain was <b>really</b> <b>more</b> interested in running for president; McCain indeed created a presidential exploratory committee the following month.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in just three weeks at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California. The album was co-produced by Lewis's boyfriend Johnathan Rice, former Beachwood Sparks and All Night Radio member Dave Scher, and Under the Blacklight producer Jason Lader. Lewis attempted to record {{as many of the}} songs live as possible. [...] "We did it in the studio for my 32nd birthday," [...] according to Lewis, [...] "and we had a great time, collaborating with a bunch of friends. It was definitely a lot less focused than Rabbit Fur Coat. With that record I had a very specific vision, [...] but with this record it was <b>really</b> <b>more</b> about the vibe, the songs and the collaborations". A source quoted by Entertainment Weekly said that the album [...] "all sounds super natural, nice, and simple. Like it doesn't belong in any decade. It's just timeless." [...] The album was inspired by a variety of musical styles, including alternative country, Americana, indie rock, and soul.|$|E
500|$|There was one [...] "crucial {{historical}} fact" [...] Cameron {{chose to}} omit {{from the film}} – the SS Californian {{was close to the}} Titanic the night she sank but had turned off its radio for the night, did not hear her crew's SOS calls, and did not respond to their distress flares. [...] "Yes, the [...] Californian. That wasn't a compromise to mainstream filmmaking. That was <b>really</b> <b>more</b> about emphasis, creating an emotional truth to the film," [...] stated Cameron. He said there were aspects of retelling the sinking that seemed important in pre- and post-production, but turned out to be less important as the film evolved. [...] "The story of the Californian was in there; we even shot a scene of them switching off their Marconi radio set," [...] said Cameron. [...] "But I took it out. It was a clean cut, because it focuses you back onto that world. If Titanic is powerful as a metaphor, as a microcosm, {{for the end of the}} world in a sense, then that world must be self-contained." ...|$|E

500|$|Perry {{thought that}} it would be a great {{opportunity}} to showcase herself as an artist, as well as expressing the true meaning of her songs. She stated: [...] "I really wanted to do MTV Unplugged, obviously, because it has such a great history of showing off really who the person is... You get to hear the real story of the songs, which is important to me". The audience for the program was selected on a contest where fans over the age of 18 could send photos and explain why they were fans of Perry. The episode featuring Perry was recorded on July 22, 2009. For the recording, Perry was dressed in a pale pink chiffon evening gown, with flowers in her hair. She further said: [...] "Some people have an idea who I am, a little piece of the cake, but I get to show off <b>really</b> <b>more.</b> I have a larger-than-life personality and my clothes reflect that. For MTV Unplugged, I wanted to be a mixture of Stevie Nicks and a fairy!".|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave a mixed review, {{giving the}} film {{three out of}} four stars despite {{complaining}} that the film [...] "recycles a plot that was already old when Tracy and Hepburn were trying it out". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was very critical of the film, calling it insipid. He wrote, [...] "Anne Fletcher directs Peter Chiarelli's script like a manufacturer of hard plastic that is guaranteed to ward off intrusion from all recognizable human emotion." [...] New York Times writer Manohla Dargis felt that Bullock's character was awkward in comparison to her previous work. She continued: [...] "She’s always been better in fundamentally independent roles that allow her to grab the wheel [...] and take the spotlight , an independence that persists {{all the way through the}} last-act coupling. She can smile as brightly at a man as well as the next leading lady, though, like all genuinely big female stars, she’s <b>really</b> <b>more</b> of a solo act." [...] The Telegraph Tim Robey expressed disappointment towards the film, giving it a two out of five stars.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 1997, Blink-182 would enter an {{extended}} period of touring. The group had played a handful of dates on the Vans Warped Tour 1996, a lifestyle tour promoting skateboarding and punk rock music. However, upon Dude Ranch release and popularity, Blink-182 would play every date of the 1997 tour worldwide with influences Pennywise, NOFX, and Social Distortion. [...] "The Warped Tour is <b>really</b> <b>more</b> of a traveling-band barbecue," [...] commented DeLonge. [...] "You hang out with the other bands all day, you play your set, and then hang out again." [...] In late 1997 and early 1998, the band would be on the road for nine months straight, only coming home to San Diego {{for days at a time}} before striking out on the next tour. [...] "When we did our longest tour stretch, it was right when I started dating my fiancee," [...] recalled DeLonge. [...] "We were all new and in love, and I had to leave. It was just, 'Hey, I'll see you in nine months.' It was really hard." [...] In addition to the hefty touring schedule, the trio grew tired of other commitments, including interviews and TV appearances due to the success of [...] "Dammit".|$|E
