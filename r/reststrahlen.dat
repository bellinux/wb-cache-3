50|$|The <b>reststrahlen</b> effect (German: “residual rays”) is a {{reflectance}} {{phenomenon in}} which electromagnetic radiation within a narrow energy band cannot propagate {{within a given}} medium due {{to a change in}} refractive index concurrent with the specific absorbance band of the medium in question; this narrow energy band is termed the <b>reststrahlen</b> band.|$|E
50|$|The {{energies}} {{at which}} <b>reststrahlen</b> bands occur vary and are particular {{to the individual}} compound.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>reststrahlen</b> {{effect is}} used to {{investigate}} the properties of semiconductors, it is also used in geophysics and meteorology.|$|E
50|$|As {{a result}} of this {{inability}} to propagate, normally incident <b>reststrahlen</b> band radiation experiences strong-reflection or total-reflection from that medium.|$|E
50|$|<b>Reststrahlen</b> bands {{manifest}} in diffuse reflectance infrared absorption spectra as complete band reversal, or in infrared emission spectra as a minimum in emissivity.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{physical}} attributes of a compound {{will have an}} effect on the appearance of the <b>reststrahlen</b> band these include phonon band-gap, particle/grain size, strongly absorbing compounds, compounds with optically opaque bands in the infrared.|$|E
50|$|Some {{materials}} have negative permittivity at certain infrared wavelengths related to phonons rather than plasmons (so-called <b>reststrahlen</b> bands).

50|$|Through the {{improvements}} of instruments and invention of new techniques he could measure infrared radiation for {{larger and larger}} wavelengths. One of his goals was {{to better understand the}} reflexion of radiation by metals and crystals. It was known that this became stronger for wavelengths which were absorbed. This lead him to a new, powerful method by selective reflexion from several crystals to isolate a narrow range of infrared wavelengths from a broader spectrum of radiation. Using such <b>Reststrahlen</b> he could in 1898 detect wavelengths of sizes around 60&thinsp;&mu;m.|$|E

Here we examine the same set of <b>reststrahlen</b> features in the spectra of diogenites and eucrites and place them {{in the context of the}} terrestrial samples and of a suite of well-characterized synthetic pyroxenes.

40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{is described}} which is convenient {{for studying the}} optical properties of substances with <b>reststrahlen</b> having wave-lengths from 6 to 150 μ. A vibrationless support is described, the essential features of which are copied from the design of R. Müller but the construction is simplified. The transmission of several gases was studied with <b>reststrahlen</b> having wave-lengths 20 to 33 μ. SO_ 2 shows strong absorption at 20. 75 μ. The reflectivity of SO_ 2 was tested and found to be zero at both 20. 75 μ and 8. 7 μ where it has strong absorption bands. Gas absorptions from 20 to 33 μ are compared with the Raman indications. Transmissivities and reflectivities of various materials are given for the spectral region 20 to 33 μ. β−MgO {{was found to have}} a <b>reststrahlen</b> near 23 μ. Potassium iodide was found to be transparent to wave-lengths greater than 33 μ...|$|E
30|$|Once {{the stack}} {{thickness}} is known, the individual thicknesses of each layer {{can be determined}} by fitting the calculated spectra to interference effects in the <b>reststrahlen</b> region of the spectrum. Layer thicknesses were varied by {{taking into account the}} previously determined overall thickness. Under this constraint, the reflectance above 1200  cm− 1 does not change significantly. The interference effects in the <b>reststrahlen</b> region can be distinguished from other features such as TO and LO vibrational modes {{based on the fact that}} the interference fringes shift in position as the layer thicknesses are varied [28].|$|E
30|$|The {{amorphous}} state of phase-change materials is bonded covalently, while the crystalline phase utilizes resonant bonding. Due to this fact, the dielectric permittivity of the crystalline phase above the <b>reststrahlen</b> {{and below the}} optical band gap is several times bigger {{than that of the}} amorphous phase [13]. Vibrational properties of phase-change materials have been studied using Raman spectroscopy in [14 - 16]. In this study, we have focused on the dispersion of dielectric function of phase-change materials in the <b>reststrahlen.</b> The dielectric function of two Ge-Sb-Te alloys: Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 and Ge 3 Sb 2 Te 6, has been investigated.|$|E

Contrary to single-photon measurements, our two-photon measurements do not suffer from the problems of strong reflection and small penetration depth of light in the <b>Reststrahlen</b> band of the GaAs host lattice. As a result, we are able to measure a significant fraction of the magnetic field dependent anticrossing of the 1 s- 3 d(+ 2) transition with the LO-phonon...|$|E
40|$|The first {{high-resolution}} quantitative directional {{hemispherical reflectance}} spectra of minerals {{were obtained for}} different particle sizes, and were used to develop an accurate prediction of the particles' spectral emissivity, using Kirchhoff's law (Nicodemus, 1965) and to interpret the nature and causes {{of changes in the}} spectral contrast of <b>reststrahlen</b> bands. It was found that the <b>reststrahlen</b> bands change in shape as well as intensity; this is explained by the occurrence of substantial volume scattering at fine particle sizes.

40|$|Infrared {{properties}} of the multimode polar optical phonons in sapphire have been studied by the small-angle oblique-incidence reflectometry (SAOIR) using the a- and c-face of the crystal. It is found that the <b>reststrahlen</b> reflection accompanies the total reflection due to Snell's law and the null reflection due to Brewster's law {{in the form of}} line structures at frequencies very close to longitudinal optical (LO) phonons. The analysis of the observations in terms of Gervais and Piriou's four-parameter semi-quantum oscillator model yields the frequencies and damping energies of all modes of the polar optical phonons. In addition, three weak bands which are allowed for E||c and ascribed to the multiphonon absorptions are observed on the wing of the <b>reststrahlen</b> band of an A 2 u mode...|$|E
40|$|Reflectance {{spectroscopy}} in {{the infrared}} is a powerful tool to characterise the optical properties of analogue materials for Mars. In this work we present laboratory studies of four Martian analogues: calcite, montmorillonite, palagonite and andesite. Diffuse and specular reflectance and transmittance spectra in the IR are shown. The spectral effect produced by small grains clung to the larger ones is analysed for calcite. Significant variations in the diffuse reflectance spectrum, especially in the <b>reststrahlen</b> region, are observed. The diffuse reflectance spectra of the other materials show the shift of the <b>reststrahlen</b> features with Si content in the materials. Optical constants of andesite are retrieved, by using the Lorentz model, from the specular reflectance spectrum. These values are fundamental in performing modelling of the radiance coming from the planet Mars...|$|E

30|$|Quartz and {{carbonate}} minerals are spectrally {{characterized by}} strong vibrational absorption features within the 8 – 14 μm (Salisbury and D’Aria 1992 a; Hook et al., 1999). The emissivity absorption features of quartz at 8.3 and 9.1 μm {{are related to}} fundamental asymmetric Si-O stretching vibrations (<b>reststrahlen</b> bands). The <b>reststrahlen</b> bands of quartz are the strongest of any silicate mineral (Salisbury and D’Aria 1992 b). The emissivity absorption features of calcite and dolomite at 11.3 μm are related to out-of-plane bending modes of the CO 3 ion (Clark 1999). Note that dolomite exhibits a greater decrease in emissivity between 10.7 and 11.3 μm than calcite. This characteristic {{is caused by the}} greater width and shorter wave-length position of the bending feature of dolomite at 11.15 μm relative to the bending feature of calcite at 11.27 μm (Rockwell and Hofstra 2008).|$|E
30|$|Low-Ca Mg-rich orthopyroxenes are {{the main}} {{constituent}} of E-type asteroids and—in combination with olivine and iron–nickel metals—of ordinary chondrites. Spectra of a natural sample of enstatite (Fig.  4) display a distinct CF at 8.4  µm and a broad <b>Reststrahlen</b> band around 9.3  µm (Salisbury et al. 1991) {{as well as an}} additional broad <b>Reststrahlen</b> feature between 12 and 14  µm (that is shifted to longer wavelengths in the spectra of high-Ca pyroxenes). The characteristic 18 -µm band (Barucci et al. 2008) is detectable in our enstatite sample. In the emissivity spectrum of our enstatite sample we can recognize a distinctive band around 39  µm together with a very broad feature above 43  µm centered around 53  µm. The enstatite band around 97  µm (a similar band is present in the serpentine spectrum too) can be seen in both our Allende and Millbillillie meteorites.|$|E

30|$|The {{determination}} of layer thicknesses from {{the comparison of}} the reflectance data to the calculated spectrum is a two-step process [27]. First, the fringes in the transparent region above the <b>reststrahlen</b> bands (ω[*]>[*] 1200  cm− 1) are due to interference effects on the layers of the multi-layer structure. In this way, the overall thickness of the investigated structure, which is a sum of all layers, can be estimated.|$|E

40|$|Several {{problems}} {{of interest in}} planetary infrared remote sensing are investigated using a new radiative-conductive model of energy transfer in regoliths: the solid-state greenhouse effect, thermal beaming, and <b>reststrahlen</b> spectra. The results of the analysis are as follows: (1) The solid-state greenhouse effect is self-limiting to a rise of a few tens of degrees in bodies of the outer solar system. (2) Non-Lambertian directional emissivity can account for only about 20 % of the observed thermal beaming factor. The remainder must have another cause, presumably surface roughness effects. (3) The maximum in a <b>reststrahlen</b> emissivity spectrum does not occur exactly at the Christiansen wavelength where, by definition, the real part of the refractive index equals one, but rather at the first transition minimum in reflectance associated with the transition from particle scattering being dominated by volume scattering to that dominated by strong surface scattering. The transparency feature is at the second transition minimum and {{does not require the}} presence of a second band at longer wavelength for its occurance. Subsurface temperature gradients have only a small effect on emissivity bands...|$|E

40|$|Inspired by moth eyes, nature's most {{powerful}} antireflex, {{we present a}} sub-wavelength SiC micropyramid design, which operates in the <b>Reststrahlen</b> band of SiC, namely the spectral band of strong phonon-photon coupling in the SiC material. While within this band SiC repels EM waves, we observe here a broad low-reflectivity window with unique attributes, with distinct characteristics different from typical dielectric moth-eye-like structures. To be specific, while the latter systems are entirely symmetric, the reflection response of our SiC micropyramid system can be highly asymmetric. In particular, the SiC micropyramid system can be near-reflectionless for light impinging from the tip side of the micropyramids and exhibits more than 90 % reflection for light impinging from the base side of the micropyramids, over a broad wavelength range in the SiC <b>Reststrahlen</b> band. This strongly asymmetric reflection response emanates from the cascaded coupling of vortex-like cavity modes {{at each of the}} SiC blocks comprising the micropyramids and translates into a strongly uni-directional absorber response. We discuss how, by virtue of Kirchhoff's law, this strongly uni-directional superabsorber behavior implies a strongly uni-directional emission profile that is important for one-way infrared sources and passive radiative-cooling systems.

Under Arhighplus-laser excitation, we find an emission spectrum at the longitudinal-optical-phonon energies of the material (137. 5 and 157. 5 cmhigh- 1).
