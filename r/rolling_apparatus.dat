A special 65 ° delta wing, the so called DLR-PSP model, was tested in the transonic wind tunnel DNW-TWG in Göttingen. A <b>rolling</b> <b>apparatus</b> was built up to enable roll rates up to 10 Hz.

40|$|The {{presence}} of micro-dimples {{on the surface}} of workpieces has long been known to {{have a positive impact on}} the friction control and wear resistance at the sliding surfaces. Several manufacturing processes have been used to generate micro-dimples on the surfaces of parts subjected to mechanical contact. Among those methods, metal forming-based techniques have received little attention in the literature mainly due to the challenges present in formation of sub-millimetre dimples using these processes. In this study, a micro-dimple <b>rolling</b> <b>apparatus</b> was developed to rapidly generate dimples with square cross-sections and side dimensions of smaller than 200 μm. The dimples were formed {{on the surface of}} a low-carbon structural steel and the effect of generated texture on friction and wear was studied through pin-on-disc test. In comparison with untextured surfaces, the results proved that the dimples formed by the proposed system could effectively reduce the friction coefficient by up to 23 % and weight loss due to wear by up to 50 %...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} longitudinal-lay surface finish on the elastohydrodynamic film {{thickness}} {{and the percentage}} of film between rolling disks in contact were evaluated using a <b>rolling</b> disk <b>apparatus.</b> Film thickness was measured by transmitted X-rays, and percentage of film was monitored by an alternating-current continuity circuit. Disk finish was varied on both the crowned upper disk and the cylindrical lower disk. A type- 2 ester and a synthetic paraffinic oil were used as lubricants. It was shown that the roughness with longitudinal lay has a deleterious effect on both film thickness and percentage of film. Measured film thicknesses for the two lubricants were comparable at equivalent test conditions. The percentage of film where a change in surface topography was observed was approximately 20 percent for the synthetic paraffinic oil and 10 percent for the type- 2 ester...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWear {{phenomena}} {{involve a}} large number of physical and mechanical parameters which are not always well known or controlled during relative movement between two bodies. Numerous industrial applications necessitate an evaluation of technological component life time and wear modelling often fails to give accurate estimation. We use the classical Archard's wear model where wear is related to dissipated power. It appears that great dispersion can occur in the estimation of dissipated power related to a lack of knowledge of certain parameters. We present here a probabilistic approach of the contact problem resolution. We consider the specific contact problem in the case of steady state <b>rolling.</b> A wear <b>apparatus</b> has been used to test different materials and we use the simplified model Fastsim to evaluate slip and tangential traction in the contact zone. For each parameter of the simulation, we construct a probabilistic density function with the only information available. A Monte-Carlo method is implemented and the resolution of numerous cases allows the dissipated energy to be evaluated as a mean value and a confidence region for 95 % viability...|$|R
30|$|As it is {{mentioned}} above, {{the effect of}} 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine was tested on the stability of shale cuttings. According to API, 20  g of shale cuttings were added to 350 ccs of drilling fluids. After that they were hot rolled for 16  h at 250  °F. Figure  11 shows the shale recovery of various amounts of 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine against base mud. Shale recovery of base mud was relatively low. However, adding one percentage of 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine has extremely increased shale recovery from 17.2 to 76.1 %. From Fig.  13, it can be understood that the drilling fluid with 6 (v/v %) of 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine has the highest shale recovery {{with the amount of}} 83.4 %. However, the difference between shale recovery of 2 (v/v %) and 6 (v/v %) is relatively low. Consequently, the optimal volume fraction of 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine is 2 (v/v %). It should be noted that 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine has two mechanisms to increase the stability of shale cuttings. First, 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine is one of the oligomeric cationic amines with two cationic charges. Due to cationic property and size, these particles enter into clay platelets. Hence, water molecules are excluded from clay platelets, so that clay cannot be hydrated (Khodja et al. 2010; Saboori et al. 2018; Zhong et al. 2011). In addition, surfaces and edges of shale have negatively charged in the pH range of 9 – 11 (Alemdar et al. 2005). Hence, electrostatic interaction causes absorbance of 1, 6 -hexamethylenediamine {{on the surface of the}} shale. These two mechanisms tremendously increase the stability of shale cuttings (Zhong et al. 2011). It should be mentioned that there is a specified procedure for shale recovery testing. Before starting the test, all apparatus and equipment such as weighting <b>apparatus,</b> <b>rolling</b> oven, etc. were completely calibrated. In addition, the test was conducted by expert workers very carefully. Therefore, the error of the experiment was kept at the minimum range.|$|R
