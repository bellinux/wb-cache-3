50|$|When woody tissues are diseased, {{they may}} exude {{different}} kinds of substances. When the exudate is gummy, the symptom is called gummosis, while it is <b>resinosis</b> when it is resinous. If the exudate is neither gummy nor resinous, it is described as bleeding.|$|E
50|$|Induced (traumatic) resin {{in white}} spruce leaders {{resistant}} or {{susceptible to the}} white pine weevil was analyzed for volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids after simulated white pine weevil damage (Tomlin et al. 2000). Leaders from 331 trees were wounded just below the apical bud with a 1-mm diameter drill, coinciding with the natural time of weevil oviposition in the spring. Leaders were removed in the autumn, and the bark and xylem from {{the upper and lower}} regions of the leader extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography. Unwounded trees had low amounts of resin in xylem compared with bark. In response to wounding, volatile terpenes and diterpene resin acids increased in the upper xylem (area of wounding), with resistant trees showing a greater increase than susceptible trees. Wounding caused monoterpenes in particular to decrease in the lower region of the leader (away from the drilled area) in greater amounts in susceptible trees than in resistant trees. In response to wounding, the proportion of monoterpene to resin acid increased in the upper and lower xylem of resistant trees, and slightly increased in the upper xylem of susceptible trees. Monoterpene-enriched resin is more fluid than constitutive resin, and probably flows more readily into oviposition cavities and larval mines, where it may kill immature weevils. Loss of resin components in the lower xylem suggested catabolism and transport of these materials to the site of wounding; however, energetic and regulatory data are necessary to confirm this hypothesis. This study provides a basis for measuring the ability of a tree to undergo traumatic <b>resinosis,</b> which could be used to screen for resistance to white pine weevil.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 A {{population}} of the Douglas-fir cone moth, Barbara colfaxiana (Kft.), was studied on the Buckhead Seed Production Area, Oakridge, Oregon, during 1971 and 1972. A method of estimating cone and insect populations is presented. Factors contributing to the mortality of B. colfaxiana are discussed, with <b>resinosis</b> being the critical factor. Larval food consumption is discussed with reference to calories of cone tissue consumed through time. An average of 761 calories are consumed through the four larval stages. Amounts consumed of each structure (bracts, scales, seeds) are presented. A structural model is presented that depicts the role of B. colfaxiana in a natural stand...|$|E
40|$|The new spruce disease {{known as}} "spruce cone rust" was {{discovered}} {{for the first}} time in Serbia and Montenegro. The fungus was detected in spruce forests only in the mountains regions (Kopaonik, Zlatar, Durmitor). This rust periodically damages the cones in localised forest areas and can be a serious problem. Usually seeds are not formed in diseased cones, and even when they are produced, malformation and <b>resinosis</b> of the cones hinder seed dispersal or extraction. Those seeds that are formed tend to weigh less and have poor germination. As this disease is a serious problem, care must be taken to prevent the spread of the disease to the new uninfected regions...|$|E
40|$|Summary We {{examined}} drought-induced {{changes in}} sus-ceptibility of potted Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) trees to a bark-beetle associated fungus (Leptographium wingfieldii Morelet, from the bark beetle Tomicus piniperda L.). Five-year-old field-grown trees were transplanted to 50 -l pots and grown for 1 {{year before the}} treatments were applied. Trees in the drought treatment were subjected to several successive, 3 -week-long drought cycles, with predawn water potential dropping below – 2 MPa at peak drought intensity. The experi-mental drought cycles were more severe than the natural drought episodes usually recorded in Scots pine stands. Trees were then mass-inoculated with L. wingfieldii at a density close to the critical threshold density of inoculations (400 m– 2) above which tree resistance is overcome. Inoculation of well-watered trees resulted in induced reaction zones around the inoculation points and very limited damage (<b>resinosis)</b> in the sapwood. Drought alone had no long-lasting consequences on tree water relations, except for a decrease in hydraulic con-ductance in the youngest segments of the main stem. However, the combination of mass-inoculation and drought stress after inoculation resulted in a dramatic loss of stem hydraulic con-ductivity that was paralleled by conspicuous damage to the sapwood (<b>resinosis,</b> drying and blue staining). There was a close correlation between amount of visible sapwood damage and loss of hydraulic conductivity. The intensity of induced re-actions in the phloem was unaffected by drought stress. We conclude that tree defence against L. wingfieldii is decreased during severe drought stress, resulting in changes in the spread and action of the fungus in the sapwood {{but not in the}} phloem...|$|E
30|$|Trees {{assessed}} for CKR were visually divided {{at the base}} into quadrants. Quadrants for most fires were oriented with the slope, with one quadrant on the uphill side, one on the downhill side, and two on the cross-slope. In flat areas and in the California fire sites, quadrants were oriented in the cardinal directions. In {{the center of each}} quadrant, cambium status at groundline was visually assessed, as described by Ryan (1982), by removing {{a small portion of the}} bark to reveal the cambium. Live cambium is light in color, moist, and pliable. Dead cambium is darker in color and either viscous (i.e., <b>resinosis)</b> or hardened. Cambium kill rating (CKR) was calculated by summing the number of dead cambium samples per tree (0 to 4).|$|E
30|$|For example, {{there are}} several {{potential}} causes of latent tree mortality associated with duff consumption {{at the base of}} a tree during prescribed and wildfires. It has been hypothesized that cambial injury leads to a lack of carbohydrate transport from the needles to the roots, and thus to root starvation (Ryan and Fransden 1991). A second potential cause is heat-related disruption of sapwood by a wounding response that, for instance, may lead to <b>resinosis</b> (Shigo and Marx 1977) or direct sapwood consumption in recurrent fires (Rundel 1973), thus interrupting water transport and inducing water stress. Knowing the major causes of mortality is crucial because process-based models of post-fire damage associated with a lack of water transport would be very different from process-based models that predict latent mortality due to a loss of phloem transport and due to direct root mortality.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Stem {{bleeding}} disease (<b>resinosis)</b> {{of coconut}} palm {{is caused by}} Thielaviopsis paradoxa and {{is very important in}} the state of Sergipe, Brazil. Understanding the epidemiological behavior of the disease is essential for establishing more efficient control strategies. Thus, we characterized the temporal progression and spatial distribution of stem bleeding in a commercial orchard under conditions of natural infection in the area of Neopolis, Sergipe. Three plots with 729 plants each were selected and evaluated every two months for stem bleeding incidence. In the temporal analysis, the monomolecular model gave the best fit to data on disease incidence, as it accurately showed the temporal dynamics of the disease during the experiment period. The spatial pattern of stem bleeding varied over time, with initial infections presenting random pattern and then evolving to aggregate pattern during evaluations. This indicates that the disease may have originated from the pathogen survival structures, followed by auto infections caused by dissemination from plant to plant, either by humans, by contact between roots, or by the vector Rhynchophorus palmarum...|$|E
40|$|Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis) is {{in decline}} because of {{infestation}} by the invasive hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae; ‘HWA’) and, {{to a lesser}} extent, the elongate hemlock scale (Fiorinia externa; ‘EHS’). Many conifers respond to insect herbivory by inducing oleoresin-based defenses, however it is unknown whether eastern hemlock is capable of this inducible response. We conducted a plantation setting study of artificially infested saplings to determine if feeding by HWA or EHS induces changes in the tree’s volatile chemistry. The induced changes in volatiles we found were unlike the terpenoid-based defenses of related conifers. Only HWA feeding elevated methyl salicylate, a plant signal for systemic acquired resistance, and benzyl alcohol, a known antimicrobial and aphid deterrent. The influence of environmental conditions and tree life-stage on hemlock volatile chemistry, potentially important factors for wild hemlock populations, is unknown. We investigated whether mature and immature forest trees respond to HWA infestation with the same patterns of volatile production as plantation saplings in full sun and amended soils. HWA induced volatile changes {{comparable to those of}} plantation saplings, with many-fold benzenoid increases and no terpenoid-based <b>resinosis.</b> Nearly all volatiles were substantially more abundant in forest than plantation trees, suggesting the effect of site conditions should be addressed in investigations of mechanisms operative in HWA-resistant biotypes of eastern hemlock. Our findings represent the first important step toward understanding the influence of inducible phytochemical responses on hemlock susceptibility to exotic pests, and highlight the possibility of salicylic acid-dependent biosynthetic activity in this gymnosperm system...|$|E
40|$|Summary Conifers {{have evolved}} {{constitutive}} and inducible defense mechanisms to help in both wound healing and defense against attack by bark beetles and other organisms. These de-fenses include oleoresin, phenolics, and static structures in sec-ondary phloem, such as lignified cells and calcium oxalate crystals, that create physical barriers. We used a phylogenetic approach to investigate the defense anatomy of conifer stems of 13 species from five families following treatment with methyl jasmonate (MJ), a compound that induces defense responses in stems of several Pinaceae species. Methyl jasmonate induced a response similar to wounding except that the response was not accompanied by lesion formation, necro-sis or a hypersensitive response. In the Pinaceae species stud-ied, MJ induced polyphenolic parenchyma (PP) cell activation and xylem traumatic resin duct (TD) formation. Members of the Taxodiaceae, which are not known to produce large quanti-ties of resin, showed massive xylem TD formation and surface <b>resinosis</b> following MJ treatment. Treatment with MJ caused members of the Araucariaceae and Cupressaceae to form axial phloem resin ducts but not xylem ducts, whereas Podo-carpaceae species showed no induction of resin-producing structures. All species treated with MJ showed phenolic depo-sition in PP cells, and early lignification of phloem fibers was observed {{in most of the}} non-Pinaceae species. We conclude that, although evolution of resin-producing structures occurred independently in conifer lineages, MJ seems to induce resin production regardless of tissue location, as well as inducing deposition of phenolic compounds. Co-evolution of conifer defensive strategies and bark beetle pests is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Stem-boring {{insects and}} methyl jasmonate (MeJA) {{are thought to}} induce similar complex {{chemical}} and anatomical defenses in conifers. To compare insect- and MeJA-induced terpenoid responses, we analyzed traumatic oleoresin mixtures, emissions of terpenoid volatiles, and expression of terpenoid synthase (TPS) genes in Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis) following attack by white pine weevils (Pissodes strobi) or application of MeJA. Both insects and MeJA caused traumatic resin accumulation in stems, with more accumulation induced by the weevils. Weevil-induced terpenoid emission profiles were also more complex than emissions induced by MeJA. Weevil feeding caused a rapid release of a blend of monoterpene olefins, presumably by passive evaporation of resin compounds from stem feeding sites. These compounds were not found in MeJA-induced emissions. Both weevils and MeJA caused delayed, diurnal emissions of (−) -linalool, indicating induced de novo biosynthesis of this compound. TPS transcripts strongly increased in stems upon insect attack or MeJA treatment. Time courses and intensity of induced TPS transcripts were different for monoterpene synthases, sesquiterpene synthases, and diterpene synthases. Increased levels of weevil- and MeJA-induced TPS transcripts accompanied major changes in terpenoid accumulation in stems. Induced TPS expression profiles in needles were less complex than those in stems and matched induced de novo emissions of (−) -linalool. Overall, weevils and MeJA induced similar, but not identical, terpenoid defense responses in Sitka spruce. Findings of insect- and MeJA-induced accumulation of allene oxide synthase-like and allene oxide cyclase-like transcripts {{are discussed in the}} context of traumatic <b>resinosis</b> and induced volatile emissions in this gymnosperm system...|$|E
40|$|We {{analyzed}} the expression pattern of various terpene synthase (TPS) genes {{in response to}} a wounding injury applied to the apical leader of Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis Bong. Carr.) genotypes known to be resistant (R) or susceptible (S) to white pine weevil (Pissodes strobi Peck.) attack. The purpose was to test if differences in constitutive or wound-induced TPS expression can be associated with established weevil resistance. All wounding treatments were conducted on 9 -year-old R and S trees growing under natural field conditions within the range of variation for weevil R and S genotypes. Representative cDNAs of the monoterpene synthase (mono-TPS), sesquiterpene synthase (sesqui-TPS), and diterpene synthase (di-TPS) classes were isolated from Sitka spruce to assess TPS transcript levels. Based on amino acid sequence similarity, the cDNAs resemble Norway spruce (Picea abies) (−) -linalool synthase (mono-TPS; PsTPS-Linl) and levopimaradiene/abietadiene synthase (di-TPS; PsTPS-LASl), and grand fir (Abies grandis) δ-selinene synthase (sesqui-TPS; PsTPS-Sell). One other mono-TPS was functionally identified as (−) -limonene synthase (PsTPS-Lim). No significant difference in constitutive expression levels for these TPSs was detected between R and S trees. However, over a postwounding period of 16 d, only R trees exhibited significant transcript accumulation for the mono- and sesqui-TPS tested. Both R and S trees exhibited a significant accumulation of PsTPS-LASl transcripts. An assessment of traumatic resin duct formation in wounded leaders showed that both R and S trees responded by forming traumatic resin ducts; however, the magnitude of this response was significantly greater in R trees. Collectively, our data imply that the induced <b>resinosis</b> response is an important aspect of defense in weevil R Sitka spruce trees growing under natural conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Annosus root {{disease is}} mainly a concern in pines and true firs in California. It is most serious {{on the east}} side of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade crest, in the {{mountains}} of southern California, and in higher elevation fir forests. Symptoms caused by the disease include crown decline and decay and <b>resinosis</b> of roots. Several signs of the fungus may be found. Conks are most common in stumps. Mycelial sheets on the inner bark and popcorn conks on thin-barked roots are diagnostic. Declining trees or recent mortality are best for diagnosis. Wood samples should be symptomatic but not well decayed. Laboratory procedures are available to confirm the presence of H. annosum. In the southwestern United States, annosus root disease, caused by Heterobasidion annosum (Fr.) Bref., in fir and pine forests is primarily a concern in California. However, stands of these species in areas of western Nevada, Arizona, and New Mexico also are affected. Within this broad area, specific forest types in which the disease is likely to be found and may cause damage have been identified. These higher "hazard " areas are identifiable by host species affected and forest type. The disease is prevalent, mainly in pine (Pinus spp.), {{on the east side}} of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade mountains. A second area in California with higher levels of the disease is in the mountains of the southern part of the state, again mainly on pine, but also on white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. and Glend.) Lindl.). This includes the San Bernardino and San Gabriel mountains. A third, broader area is at higher elevations where true firs (Abies spp.) are often infected. In California, the forest types most severely affected are the mixed conifer (Society of American Foresters forest cover type 243), ponderosa pine (SAF 245), white fir (SAF 211), and red fir (SAF 207) types. In Arizona and Ne...|$|E
40|$|The {{ecology of}} the eastern larch beetle, Dendroctonus simplex LeConte, was studied in Newfoundland. Overwintered beetles emerged in May. One {{generation}} and two broods were produced in both 1983 and 1984. Females initiated attacks and males arrived up to two days later. One to four pairs of beetles used each entrance hole but each pair constructed a different gallery. [...] Egg galleries were vertical, slightly sinuous and averaged 41 cm in length. Females laid zero to four eggs per niche averaging 1. 4. The average number of eggs per gallery and per cm of gallery was 39 and 1. 0, respectively. Mean brood density was 49 individuals per 100 cm². [...] About 90 % of all parents reemerged and {{a small proportion of}} them attacked a second group of trees and produced a second brood. Galleries in second brood trees averaged 26 cm in length and 27 eggs per gallery. Mean brood density averaged 23 individuals per 100 cm². Following brood production 61 % of parents reemerged and likely died. [...] Development from egg to adult averaged 60 to 70 days for first and second broods, respectively. [...] During egg gallery construction and oviposition D. simplex flight muscles degenerated. Flight muscles were completely regenerated in only 17 % of 96 reemerged beetles in 1984. No reemerged beetles were observed to fly. [...] Emergence, host attack and reemergence occurred between 10 : 30 and 17 : 00 hours and at temperatures of 4 ﾟC or higher. Peaks of attack, which reflects flight peaks, occurred at temperatures of 10 ﾟC or higher. [...] Only adults overwintered. Freezing temperatures caused high mortality among immature stages of the second brood. [...] Thirty-four percent of new brood adults emerged in the fall and reentered galleries at the base of trees for hibernation. [...] The fourth larval instar had the highest mortality, at 29. 2 %, and pupae the lowest, at 7. 6 %. Total mortality was 79 % and 82 % for first and second broods, respectively. Pathogens caused the largest proportion of mortality among eggs, second instar larvae and pupae, <b>resinosis</b> among first instar larvae and parasitoids among third and fourth instar larvae. Overwintering mortality was 7. 8 %. [...] Fifty-two species of insects, spiders, mites and nematodes were associated with D. simplex in 1983...|$|E
