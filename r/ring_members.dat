5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey distillers and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some <b>Ring</b> <b>members</b> after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

[...] The jury listened to the president's words and quickly acquitted Babcock of any charges. [...] Broadhead went on to close out all the other cases in the Whiskey Ring.

In April 1880, {{there had been a}} congressional {{investigation}} into corruption in the Post Office Department, in which profiteering rings allegedly stole millions of dollars, securing bogus mail contracts on star routes. After obtaining contracts with the lowest bid, costs to run the mail routes would be escalated and profits would be divided among <b>ring</b> <b>members.</b> That year, Hayes stopped the implementation of any new star route contracts. Shortly after taking office, Garfield received information from Attorney General MacVeagh and Postmaster General James of postal corruption by an alleged star route ringleader, Second Assistant Postmaster-General Thomas J. Brady. Garfield demanded Brady's resignation and ordered prosecutions that would end in trials for conspiracy. When told that his party, including his own campaign manager, Stephen W. Dorsey, was involved, Garfield directed MacVeagh and James to root out the corruption in the Post Office Department [...] "to the bone", regardless of where it might lead. Brady resigned and was eventually indicted for conspiracy. After two [...] "star route" [...] ring trials in 1882 and 1883, the jury found Brady not guilty.|$|E

Hazardous material such as radioactive waste may be sealed in plastic bags for small items or wrapped in plastic sheeting for large items. Occasionally the need arises to access the hazardous material in a controlled manner, that is, while maintaining total containment. Small items could be placed entirely inside a containment glovebag.

5000|$|Bristow's {{greatest}} {{work in the}} Treasury Department came in {{prosecution and}} break up of the notorious Whiskey Ring headquartered in St. Louis [...] The Whisky Ring was powerful and corrupt machine started by western distillers and their allies in the Internal Revenue Service; it profiteered by evading the collection of taxes on whisky production. Despite Washington rumors of its existence, the ring seemed to be impregnable to prosecution. [...] George W. Fishback, owner of the St. Louis Democrat advised Bristow on how to expose the ring and to bypass any corrupt federal appointees who would tip other ring partners of a federal investigation. [...] Investigative reporters were assigned by Bristow outside of the Treasury Department who obtained a vast supply of evidence in St. Louis of frauds committed by the ring. [...] To keep the investigation secret, Bristow gave the reporters a cipher different from the Treasury code. Similar investigative work was done in Chicago and Milwaukee. [...] On May 10, 1875, Bristow struck hard shattering the ring at one blow. Corrupt distilleries and rectifying houses in these three cities were seized and shut down. Books and papers were confiscated that proved and identified individual <b>ring</b> <b>members</b> guilt. [...] Bristow instituted almost 250 federal civil and criminal lawsuits against <b>ring</b> <b>members.</b> Within a year, Bristow had recovered 3,150,000 in unpaid taxes, had indicted 176 men, and had obtained 110 convictions on <b>ring</b> <b>members.</b>|$|E

5000|$|As {{response}} to the missing availability of abandonware, people have distributed old software since shortly after the beginning of personal computing, but the activity remained low-key until {{the advent of the}} Internet. While trading old games has taken many names and forms, the term [...] "abandonware" [...] was coined by Peter Ringering in late 1996. Ringering found classic game websites similar to his own, contacted their webmasters, and formed the original Abandonware Ring in February 1997. This original webring {{was little more than a}} collection of sites linking to adventureclassicgaming.com. Another was a site indexing them all to provide a rudimentary search facility. In October 1997, the Interactive Digital Software Association sent cease and desist letters to all sites within the Abandonware Ring, which led to most shutting down. An unintended consequence (called the Streisand effect in Internet parlance) was that it spurred others to create new abandonware sites and organizations that came to outnumber the original <b>Ring</b> <b>members.</b> Sites formed after the demise of the original Abandonware Ring include Abandonia, Bunny Abandonware and Home of the Underdogs. In later years abandonware websites actively acquired and received permissions from developers and copyright holders (e.g. Jeff Minter, Magnetic Fields or Gremlin Interactive) for legal redistribution of abandoned works, an example is World of Spectrum who acquired the permission from many developers and successfully retracted a DMCA case.|$|E
