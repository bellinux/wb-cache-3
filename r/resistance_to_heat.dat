The metal is generally too expensive for the general consumer market, though some late model Corvettes have been manufactured with titanium exhausts, and a Corvette Z06's LT4 supercharged engine uses lightweight, solid titanium intake valves for greater strength and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|E
5|$|Predicted serpin {{genes are}} {{sporadically}} distributed in prokaryotes. In vitro studies {{on some of}} these molecules have revealed that they are able to inhibit proteases, and it is suggested that they function as inhibitors in vivo. Several prokaryote serpins are found in extremophiles. Accordingly, and in contrast to mammalian serpins, these molecules possess elevated <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> denaturation. The precise role of most bacterial serpins remains obscure, although Clostridium thermocellum serpin localises to the cellulosome. It is suggested that the role of cellulosome-associated serpins may be to prevent unwanted protease activity against the cellulosome.|$|E

40|$|In {{the many}} {{published}} discussions of chemical reactions accompanied by heat conduction and diffusion in catalyst particles, {{it has been}} tacitly assumed that the temperature and concentration profiles have the symmetry of the particle. It is {{the main purpose of}} this work to show that this is not necessarily the case, and hence, that the extensive literature on multiple solutions has uncovered only a fraction of all possible steady states. A slab {{has been used as a}} model for the catalyst particle? diffusive <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and mass flux in its interior and Newtonian <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and mass transfer at its faces has been considered. For a single first order exothermic reaction with Arrhenius temperature dependence and constant thermal and mass diffusivities, asymmetric profiles for temperature and composition have been obtained, thus verifying the above contention...|$|R

25|$|While not an {{overwhelmingly}} popular tree in cultivation, {{it is sometimes}} employed in the Southern United States as a shade tree due to its round crown and its greater <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> than that of its more showy relative the sugar maple.

40|$|Transgenic {{lines of}} Arabidopsis with HSP 101 gene in sense and anti sense orientations {{acquired}} <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> hard <b>heat</b> shock (50 ° C 10 min or 45 - 47 ° C 1 hour) and to freezing (- 4 ° C 2 hours) {{due to the}} preliminary 2 hour’s heating at 37 ° C. Thus, it was shown at {{the first time that}} the induction of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> hard <b>heat</b> shock and freezing with mild heat shock is possible in the absence of HSP 101 synthesis. Thellungiella with the genome to 95 - 97 % identical to the genome of Arabidopsis did not have higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> high temperature, but was significantly more resistant to freezing. It differed from Arabidopsis by several times higher contents of HSP 101, HSP 60 and HSC 70. Contents of these HSPs in Arabidopsis increased as a result of hardening at 4 ° C what was accompanied by the increase of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> freezing. It is supposed that the <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and cold shocks are dependent not only from HSP 101, but also from other HSPs...|$|R

25|$|Ventilation ducts {{ran through}} the gaps {{in the body and}} through the cable duct under the floor. They had {{openings}} in the floor and under the windows. The ventilation system doubled as cooling for the braking resistances. During cold weather the carriage air could be routed via the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> it, and warm and cold air could be mixed at various levels. As there was no resistance in the trailers, these were equipped with electric heaters. The trams had a 24-volt lighting system with cabin lighting from fluorescent lamps.|$|E
25|$|Soda-lime-silica glass, window glass: silica + {{sodium oxide}} (Na2O) + lime (CaO) + {{magnesia}} (MgO) + alumina (Al2O3). Is transparent, easily formed and {{most suitable for}} window glass (see flat glass). It has a high thermal expansion and poor <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> (500–600°C). It is used for windows, some low-temperature incandescent light bulbs, and tableware. Container glass is a soda-lime glass that is a slight variation on flat glass, which uses more alumina and calcium, and less sodium and magnesium, which are more water-soluble. This makes it less susceptible to water erosion.|$|E
25|$|Up to 20% of the {{dry weight}} of the {{endospore}} consists of calcium dipicolinate within the core, which is thought to stabilize the DNA. Dipicolinic acid could {{be responsible for the}} heat resistance of the spore, and calcium may aid in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and oxidizing agents. However, mutants resistant to heat but lacking dipicolinic acid have been isolated, suggesting other mechanisms contributing to heat resistance are also at work. Small acid-soluble proteins (SASPs) are found in endospores. These proteins tightly bind and condense the DNA, and are in part responsible for resistance to UV light and DNA-damaging chemicals.|$|E

40|$|The first ∼ 10 % of spores {{released}} from sporangia (early spores) during Bacillus subtilis sporulation were isolated, and their properties {{were compared to}} those of the total spores produced from the same culture. The early spores had significantly lower <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> wet <b>heat</b> and hypochlorite than the total spores but identical <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> dry <b>heat</b> and UV radiation. Early and total spores also had the same levels of core water, dipicolinic acid, and Ca and germinated similarly with several nutrient germinants. The wet heat resistance of the early spores could be increased to that of total spores if early spores were incubated in conditioned sporulation medium for ∼ 24 h at 37 °C (maturation), and some hypochlorite resistance was also restored. The maturation of early spores took place in pH 8 buffer with Ca 2 + but was blocked by EDTA; maturation was also seen with early spores of strains lacking the CotE protein or the coat-associated transglutaminase, both of which are needed for normal coat structure. Nonetheless, it appears to be most likely that it is changes in coat structure that are responsible for the increased <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> wet <b>heat</b> and hypochlorite upon early spore maturation...|$|R
25|$|The most {{simple way}} to make a dry-sand cores is in a dump core box, in which sand is packed into the box and scraped level with the top. A wood or metal plate is then placed over the box, and then the two are flipped over and the core segment falls out of the core box. The core segment is then baked or hardened. Multiple core {{segments}} are then hot glued together or attached by some other means. Any rough spots are filed or sanded down. Finally, the core is lightly coated with graphite, silica, or mica to give a smoother surface finish and greater <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{most high}} power Stirling engines, both the minimum {{pressure}} and mean {{pressure of the}} working fluid are above atmospheric pressure. This initial engine pressurization can be realized by a pump, or by filling the engine from a compressed gas tank, or even just by sealing the engine when the mean temperature {{is lower than the}} mean operating temperature. All of these methods increase the mass of working fluid in the thermodynamic cycle. All of the heat exchangers must be sized appropriately to supply the necessary heat transfer rates. If the heat exchangers are well designed and can supply the heat flux needed for convective heat transfer, then the engine, in a first approximation, produces power in proportion to the mean pressure, as predicted by the West number, and Beale number. In practice, the maximum pressure is also limited to the safe pressure of the pressure vessel. Like most aspects of Stirling engine design, optimization is multivariate, and often has conflicting requirements. A difficulty of pressurization is that while it improves the power, the heat required increases proportionately to the increased power. This heat transfer is made increasingly difficult with pressurization since increased pressure also demands increased thicknesses of the walls of the engine, which, in turn, increase the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> transfer.|$|E
2500|$|The {{effectiveness}} of insulated glass {{can be expressed}} as an R-value. The higher the R-value, the greater is its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> transfer. [...] A standard IGU consisting of clear uncoated panes of glass (or lights) with air in the cavity between the lights typically has an R-value of 0.35 K·m2/W.|$|E
50|$|Today {{there are}} {{primarily}} seven commodity polymers in use: polyethylene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polyethylene terephthalate, polystyrene, polycarbonate, and poly(methyl methacrylate) (Plexiglas). These make up nearly 98% of all polymers and plastics encountered in daily life. Each of these polymers {{has its own}} characteristic modes of degradation and <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat,</b> light and chemicals. Polyethylene, polypropylene, and poly(methyl methacrylate) are sensitive to oxidation and UV radiation, while PVC may discolor at high temperatures due to loss of hydrogen chloride gas, and become very brittle. PET is sensitive to hydrolysis and attack by strong acids, while polycarbonate depolymerizes rapidly when exposed to strong alkalis.|$|R

Kitchenware made with Bakelite, including canisters and tableware, was promoted for its <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and to chipping. [...] In the mid-1930s, Northland marketed a line of skis with a black [...] "Ebonite" [...] base, a coating of Bakelite. By 1935, it was used in solid-body electric guitars.

2500|$|In {{common with}} the London & North Eastern Railway Gresley Pacifics from which its valve gear design was derived, the centre {{cylinder}} and centre connecting rod's big end bearing were located beneath the steam chest and boiler where they were exposed to great heat. This problem was exacerbated by [...] reduced ventilation following the fitting of streamlining and the faster running associated with their Spirit of Progress service from 1937 onwards. The grease-lubricated locomotive axles also suffered overheating problems from the sustained higher speed running. The VR addressed both issues by switching to a [...] "red oil" [...] lubricant which had a higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat.</b>|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{calculate}} the interfacial <b>resistances</b> <b>to</b> <b>heat</b> and mass transfer through a liquid-vapor interface in a binary mixture. We use two methods, the direct calculation {{from the actual}} non-equilibrium solution and integral relations, derived earlier. We verify, that integral relations, being a relatively faster and cheaper method, indeed gives the same results as the direct processing of a non-equilibrium solution. Furthermore we compare the absolute values of the interfacial resistances with the ones obtained from kinetic theory. Matching the diagonal resistances for the binary mixture we find that kinetic theory underestimates the cross coefficients. The heat of transfer is as a consequence correspondingly larger.

The experimental results of heating on the nose of the beryllium models agreed reasonably well with theoretical results, whereas heating on the nose of the copper models was almost twice that predicted by theory. Heating of the cylindrical wall behind the hemisphere agreed fairly well with that predicted by theory at lower temperatures. Beryllium produced a thin protective oxide when <b>heated</b> <b>to</b> its melting point with no tendency to ignite before melting. Copper produced a somewhat heavier layer of oxide upon heating, and ignited when <b>heated</b> <b>to</b> near its melting point.
