In search of reliable accounts from anthropologists who had witnessed the practice of cultural cannibalism first-hand, he placed an advertisement in the newsletter of the American Anthropological Association, but again failed to come up with any first-hand documented cases. Prior to its publication, rumors had circulated in the anthropological community that Arens was putting together a book that would challenge the concept of cultural cannibalism.|$|E

However, Vyse is separated from Aika and Fina when Drachma's ship is severely damaged in a Valuan attack. Vyse ends up stranded on the small Crescent Island, where he manages to uncover letters and a map left behind by another pirate seeking a great treasure. Vyse is later found by a fellow Blue Rogue named Gilder, who takes him aboard to help him search for his friends. Meanwhile, Aika and Fina {{end up in the}} care of another Blue Rogue, Clara, who takes them to Nasr to help search for Vyse. Aika and Fina find out about the same treasure Vyse <b>read</b> <b>up</b> <b>on,</b> and the three soon reunite, but are then captured by Ramirez and brought to the Valuans' prison fortress. By enlisting the aid of the Valuan prince Enrique, who has lost patience with his government's tyranny, and stealing a powerful Valuan warship named the Delphinus, the Blue Rogues are able to escape. Vyse brings everyone back to Crescent Island, upon which he formally establishes a base of operations and living quarters for he and his fellow shipmates.|$|E

[...] Arnold stated that in England, Kenyatta's adherence to Christianity was [...] "desultory". While in London, Kenyatta had taken an interest in the atheist speakers at Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, while an Irish Muslim friend had unsuccessfully urged Kenyatta to convert to Islam. During his imprisonment, Kenyatta <b>read</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism through books supplied to him by Stock. The Israeli diplomat Asher Naim visited him in this period, noting that although Kenyatta was [...] "not a religious man, he was appreciative of the Bible". Despite portraying himself as a Christian, he found the attitudes of many European missionaries intolerable, in particular their readiness to see everything African as evil. In Facing Mount Kenya, he challenged the missionaries' dismissive attitude toward ancestor veneration, which he instead preferred to call [...] "ancestor communion". In that book's dedication, Kenyatta invoked [...] "ancestral spirits" [...] as part of [...] "the Fight for African Freedom." ...|$|E

500|$|Although a {{significant}} {{member of the}} troupe, Sylvester remained a relatively isolated figure; {{not only was he}} one of very few African-American members, he eschewed the group's more surrealist activities for what he saw as classier, more glamorous performances onstage. In the Cockettes' performances, he was usually given an entire scene to himself, often with little relevance to the narrative and theme {{of the rest of the}} show, although through doing so, he gained his own following.

500|$|The {{following}} years saw Morrissey cast in two high-profile feature films; while filming the Brian Jones biopic Stoned (2005), {{he got an}} audition for psychiatrist Dr. Michael Glass, the male lead in Basic Instinct 2 (2006). He was flown out to Los Angeles for a one-hour screen test with Sharon Stone. Their immediate rapport led to the screen test being extended by another hour and Morrissey's casting in the role. Morrissey had enjoyed the first film and liked the script for the sequel. He <b>read</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> psychiatry and worked out in a gym for the nudity scenes. The film was a box office and critical failure. The Washington Post criticised the film's focus on Morrissey's character and called the actor [...] "overmatched by Stone" [...] and [...] "a sad sack", and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called him [...] "a charisma-challenged non-entity". The same Washington Post critic later wrote in the Los Angeles Times that because Morrissey was not a film star, the chemistry between him and Stone had been spoiled. Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club wrote that Morrissey had [...] "the charisma of beige wallpaper" [...] and that [...] "the producers could have replaced him halfway through shooting with a handsome mahogany coat rack and nobody {{would be able to}} tell the difference". The bad reviews depressed Morrissey, and he briefly considered giving up acting, but instead saw the role as a chance to learn.|$|E

The episodes themselves aired from June through August that year and Byrne continued scoring and uploading his music via FTP, finishing on August 3, 2007.

2500|$|The idea of atonement for sin is {{criticized by}} Richard Dawkins {{on the grounds}} that the image of God as {{requiring}} the suffering and death of Jesus to effect reconciliation with humankind is immoral. The view is summarized by Dawkins: [...] "if God wanted to forgive our sins, why not just forgive them? Who is God trying to impress?" [...] Oxford theologian Alister McGrath maintains that Dawkins is [...] "ignorant" [...] of Christian theology, and therefore unable to engage religion and faith intelligently. He goes on to say that the atonement was necessary because of our flawed human nature, which made it impossible for us to save ourselves, and that it expresses God's love for us by removing the sin that stands in the way of our reconciliation with God. Responding to the criticism that he is [...] "ignorant" [...] of theology, Dawkins asks, [...] "Do you have to <b>read</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> leprechology before disbelieving in leprechauns?" [...] and [...] "es, I have, of course, met this point before. It sounds superficially fair. But it presupposes that there is something in Christian theology to be ignorant about. The entire thrust of my position is that Christian theology is a non-subject." [...] Dinesh D'Souza says that Dawkins' criticism [...] "only makes sense if you assume Christians made the whole thing up." [...] He goes on to say that Christians view it as a beautiful sacrifice, and that [...] "through the extremity of Golgotha, Christ reconciles divine justice and divine mercy." [...] Andrew Wilson argues that Dawkins misses the point of the atonement, which has nothing to do with masochism, but is based on the concepts of holiness, sin and grace.|$|E
