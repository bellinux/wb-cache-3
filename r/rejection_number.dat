Although, implementing this feature achieves much better flexibility and device utilization, the challenge remains to quickly and efficiently place tasks arriving at run-time on such partially reconfigurable systems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to handle this on-line, run-time task placement problem.

Tricuspid valve function was studied by color-flow Doppler echocardiogram and annual heart catheterization. The presence or severity of TR was graded {{on a scale from}} 0 (no TR) to 4 (severe). Additional postoperative data included rate of <b>rejection,</b> <b>number</b> of endomyocardial biopsies, incidence of transplant vasculopathy, and preoperative and postoperative hemodynamics. The incidence of grade 3 TR increases from 5 % at 1 year to 50 % at 4 years after transplantation.

The ischemic intervals as well as the preoperative and postoperative pulmonary hemodynamics did not affect the severity or prevalence of TR. These results indicate that various factors appear {{to have an impact on}} the development of TR and that the prevalence might be lowered by a reduction of the number of biopsies performed and when possible, oversizing of donor hearts...|$|E

The {{aim of this}} study was to assess efficacy and safety of immunoadsorption column reuse in ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation. METHODS We performed a multicentric prospective trial including all ABO-incompatible kidney transplantations in Switzerland from 2005 to 2011. Patients received rituximab and standardized immunosuppression with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroids. Antigen-specific perioperative immunoadsorption was performed. Immunoadsorption columns were reused after restoration.

In the current investigation we tested whether MSCs isolated from two fetal tissue sources such as Wharton’s jelly and Umbilical cord blood can be coaxed in vitro into cardiomyogenic lineages with the exposure to 5 ’Azacytidine and whether regeneration of in vivo mouse myocardial infarcted heart is triggered by transplantation of these differentiated cells.

40|$|International audienceIn {{a context}} of {{multiple}} hypothesis testing, we provide several new exact calculations related to the false discovery proportion (FDP) of step-up and step-down procedures. For step-up procedures, we show {{that the number of}} erroneous rejections conditionally on the <b>rejection</b> <b>number</b> is simply a binomial variable, which leads to explicit computations of the c. d. f., the {$s$-th} moment and the mean of the FDP, the latter corresponding to the false discovery rate (FDR). For step-down procedures, we derive what is to our knowledge the first explicit formula for the FDR valid for any alternative c. d. f. of the $p$-values. We also derive explicit computations of the power for both step-up and step-down procedures. These formulas are ``explicit'' {{in the sense that they}} only involve the parameters of the model and the c. d. f. of the order statistics of i. i. d. uniform variables. The $p$-values are assumed either independent or coming from an equicorrelated multivariate normal model and an additional mixture model for the true/false hypotheses is used. This new approach is used to investigate new results which are of interest in their own right, related to least/most favorable configurations for the FDR and the variance of the FDP...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{quality control}} {{has a long}} history in {{healthcare}} laboratories, being first introduced in the 1950 s by Levey and Jennings [1]. They adapted Shewhart's industrial QC approach that utilized mean and range charts [2] for use with duplicate measurements on patient pools. Henry and Segalove [3] did much to make QC practical and actually were responsible for the “single-value ” type of QC chart that is now known as the Levey-Jenning's chart. As automated analytic systems became common in the 1960 s, QC took on new importance and was widely applied. As multichannel automated analyzers were introduced in the 70 s, difficulties with QC became apparent due to the high frequency of false rejections [4]. Westgard multi-rule QC [5] was developed to minimize the false rejections due to 2 SD control limits and improve the low error detection when 3 SD control limits were employed. High-stability high-precision analyzers became common by the 1990 s, leading to “cost-effective ” design of QC procedures to minimize cost (false <b>rejection,</b> <b>number</b> of control measurements) {{and at the same time}} maximize quality (error detection) [6].

40|$|Objectives: Despite {{improvements}} in immunosuppressive protocols for renal transplant, long-term success of renal transplant is still {{limited by the}} occurrence of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy. Some {{studies have shown that}} aspirin decreases the severity of kidney ischemia-reperfusion injury and the development of tubular atrophy in animal models. This study aimed to assess the effects of aspirin therapy started at the time of transplant on long-term graft function. Materials and Methods: We compared renal graft function of 82 patients on low-dose aspirin 75 mg once daily who underwent renal transplant between 1 January 2000 and 31 December 2010 from a single center with 65 patients not taking aspirin. For each patient, the following measurements were collected: age, sex, creatinine level, type of donor, cold ischemia time, occurrence of acute allograft <b>rejections,</b> <b>number</b> of HLA mismatches, first transplant, intake of statins, number of antihypertensive medications, and number of days posttransplant. Patients were excluded from the study who were on aspirin before transplant or who had coronary artery disease. Results: Multilevel modelling was used to compare renal allograft function, as measured by serum creatinine levels, between patients taking and not taking aspirin after kidney transplant. Aspirin was not significantly associated with creatinine levels (P =. 59) after adjusting for other relevant variables. Conclusions: Low-dose aspirin started at the time of transplant has a negligible effect on renal allograft function over the 15 -year study period posttransplant...|$|R
