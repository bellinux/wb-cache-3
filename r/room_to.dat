5|$|By 1854, Hindman {{realized}} that he had little <b>room</b> <b>to</b> maneuver in the crowded Mississippi political arena. Looking across the Mississippi River, Hindman observed that the young and turbulent state of Arkansas was wide open for a well-educated and ambitious politician. Hindman left Mississippi politics when he moved to Helena, Arkansas on March 18, 1854.|$|E

5|$|In 1780, {{the society}} moved again, {{this time to}} Somerset House. The {{property}} was offered to the society by His Majesty's Government and, as soon as Sir Joseph Banks became president in November 1778, he began planning the move. Somerset House, while larger than Crane Court, was not satisfying to the fellows; the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> store the library was too small, the accommodation was insufficient {{and there was not}} enough <b>room</b> <b>to</b> store the museum at all. As a result, the museum was handed to the British Museum in 1781 and the library was extended to two rooms, one of which was used for council meetings.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but {{the expansion of the}} Drawing <b>Room</b> <b>to</b> a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the <b>room</b> <b>to</b> an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E

5|$|To Varro, Hannibal {{seemed to}} have little <b>room</b> <b>to</b> {{maneuver}} and no means of retreat as he was deployed with the Aufidus River to his rear. Varro believed that when pressed hard by the Romans' superior numbers, the Carthaginians would fall back to the river and, with no <b>room</b> <b>to</b> maneuver, would be cut down in panic. Bearing in mind that Hannibal's two previous victories had been largely decided by his trickery and ruse, Varro had sought an open battlefield. The field at Cannae was clear, with no possibility of hidden troops being brought to bear in an ambush.|$|E

Peter only knows what is happening when reading the episode's plot synopsis in TV Guide (the reason he entered the rodeo), and finds out who Luke is. As Luke escapes out the window, Peter alerts Joe, who apprehends Luke. Joe also arrests Meg for harboring a fugitive, and she is sent to prison. Luke is never heard from again in the episode.|$|E
5|$|After Gasketball 2012 release, Boxleiter and Wohlwend {{planned a}} celebratory road {{trip to a}} game jam in Victoria, British Columbia. The game did not fare as expected, so Boxleiter used the two-day jam to create the core mirror {{reflection}} mechanics of what would become TouchTone, though it would take two years of sporadic work to finalize {{the remainder of the}} game. In TouchTone, the player monitors phone calls as part of a government surveillance program to find public threats. The story is told through a series of reflection puzzles wherein the player swipes the screen to reflect a beam around a <b>room</b> <b>to</b> its intended destination.|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of success under head coach Dan McGugin and an undefeated 1921 season, Vanderbilt had outgrown its old stadium.

The steel-and-concrete structure cost about $200,000 and could seat 22,600. It was the first dedicated college football stadium in the South.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage and install a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing <b>room</b> <b>to</b> the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E
