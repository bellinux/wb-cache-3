We thus focus o 11 the economic value of the company. We first analyse the underwriting risk of the company. The maximization of the <b>risk</b> <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> of the company is derived as optimality criterion. It is shown how the <b>risk</b> <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> of heterogeneous portfolios or of catastrophe exposed portfolios can be dramatically improved through reinsurance. The improvement of the <b>risk</b> <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> through portfolio diversification is also analysed. In section 3 of the paper we analyse the loss reserve risk of the company. It is shown that this risk consists of a loss reserve development risk and of a yield curve risk which stems from the discounting of the loss reserves. This latter risk can be fully hedged through asset liability matching...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to explain the performance of equity funds by using three methods, which are <b>risk</b> adjusted <b>return</b> (RAR), <b>risk</b> <b>ratio</b> (RR), and snail trail method. The second objective is to compare equity funds performance towards market performance. The samples of this research are equity funds actively listed in BAPEPAM for period January 2008 until December 2012. The data is taken from each company’s monthly net assets value (NAV) for period January 2008 until December 2012. Mutual fund with zero NAV in the end of calculation and with foreign currency of NAV is not used as sample. The performance analysis of equity funds is calculated by using <b>Risk</b> Adjusted <b>Return</b> with Sharpe <b>Ratio</b> method, Risk Ratio, and Snail Trail. The benchmark is JCI or Jakarta Composite Index for period January 2008 – December 2012. From the three methods used, most of the equity funds are adjusted well and ready to face the risk. In fact, there are still some equity funds with underperform performance compare to the benchmark in both <b>risk</b> and <b>return.</b> The calculation of <b>risk</b> adjusted <b>return,</b> <b>risk</b> <b>ratio,</b> and snail trail are connected with the result which stated that equity funds shows a high <b>return</b> and high <b>risk</b> as well...|$|R

40|$|The major {{electricity}} market models include: pools, {{bilateral contracts}} and hybrid models. Pool prices tend to change quickly and variations are usually highly unpredictable. In this way, market participants can enter into bilateral contracts to hedge against pool price volatility. In bilateral contracts, market participants {{can set the}} terms and conditions of agreements independent of the market operator. The hybrid model combines features of both pools and bilateral contracts. This paper is devoted to risk management and the optimization of the portfolios of retailers operating in liberalized electricity markets. It introduces a model for optimizing portfolios composed by end-use consumers using the Markowitz theory. It also presents an overview of a multi-agent system for electricity markets. The system simulates the behavior of various markets entities, including generating companies, retailers and consumers. The final part of the paper presents three case studies on portfolio optimization involving risk management: a retailer (a software agent) optimizes its portfolio by {{taking into account the}} attitude towards risk and the offer of a 3 -rate tariff to five different types of consumers: industrial, large and small commercial, residential and street lightning. The results show that the retailer, by being more realistic in choosing consumers to its portfolio, can offer more competitive tariffs to key consumers and keep the portfolio optimal and stable in relation to the <b>risk</b> <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. An investors' {{objective}} is to earn a return from savings due to their deferred consumption, compensating the investor for the time, the expected rate of inflation and {{the uncertainty of the}} return. Arguably, the equity markets in general offered relative moderate returns over the past number of years. Venture capital investments on the contrary are perceived to offer super returns but also bear very high risk. Given the restricted ability of the equity market to produce super returns, the likelihood to include venture capital in an investment portfolio must be considered. Therefore, when considering supplementing a well diversified portfolio with venture capital equity, one should investigate whether this action potentially increases the portfolio's rate of return significantly, whereas the associated portfolio risk augments insignificantly. At first this paper examines Portfolio theory under the Markowitz and Sharpe Models. It then moves on to Capital Market theory that extends Portfolio theory and develops a model for pricing all risky assets. Subsequently, scrutinizing investment risk, investment's rates of return and the <b>risk</b> <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> associated with investments are done. Upon completion of the literature study, an empirical study was done on the JSE Venture Capital securities to assess the validity of including venture capital in well diversified portfolios. This study has found venture capital securities to be characterised with low or no rates of return. Since there is no correlation between the rate of return of the security and the market return, the beta coefficient as a measure of market related risk for venture capital can not be used. Furthermore, the venture capital low or no rate of return phenomena causes high variability in the coefficient of variation. Consequently, using the coefficient of variation as criteria for comparing venture capital security risk/return relationships with other securities isn't suitable. The results also indicate that venture capital and small capitalisation securities yield similar results. Therefore, when portfolio compilation is done, small capitalisation securities can be exchanged for venture capital securities without increasing the risk or altering the risk/return relationship of the portfolio.

40|$|Class of 2011 AbstractOBJECTIVES: To {{assess the}} <b>risk</b> and <b>return</b> of {{publicly}} traded {{health insurance companies}} from 1986 through 2010. METHODS: <b>Risk</b> and <b>return</b> was assessed on these companies by identifying them with SIC 6231 and 6234 (Accident and Health Insurance and Medical Service Plans) along with their presence on the CRSP database. <b>Risk</b> and <b>return</b> was analyzed via alpha and beta for SIC 632 x, which were calculated utilizing the CAPM, Fama-French 3 Factor and Carhart 4 Factor econometric models. <b>Risk</b> and <b>return</b> was further assessed by calculating a Sharpe ratio along with determining annualized mean excess return and volatility for SIC 632 x and the overall market. Lastly, cumulative price paths for both SIC 632 x and the overall market were calculated and a Monte Carlo simulation analysis in Matlab and Microsoft Excel was run to simulate 6500 portfolios to compare <b>risk</b> to <b>return</b> <b>ratios</b> for SIC 632 x over the time period of 1986 - 2010 versus the time period of 2006 - 2010. RESULTS: Overall, 110 companies were identified with SIC 6321 and 6234 and 7938 observations were made. The results were reported in a cross sectional format with five time periods of five years each (1986 - 1990, 1991 - 1995, 1996 - 2000, 2001 - 2005, and 2006 - 2010 respectively). The descriptive statistics showed that SIC 632 x had {{a higher rate of}} return than the overall market (1. 21 ± 14. 15 compared to 0. 88 ± 4. 49; however, they also had greater risk (0. 89 ± 14. 15 vs 0. 57 ± 4. 48). The CAPM model captured an overall alpha value of 0. 44 while the 3 Factor model provided an overall alpha of - 0. 20 and the 4 Factor model provided an overall alpha of 0. 31. The 4 Factor model had the highest overall r-squared value of 0. 16. The overall annualized mean excess return was greater for SIC 632 x than the overall market (10. 71...|$|R

40|$|Cost {{reduction}} plays {{a significant}} role in the field of concentrated solar thermal energy. It is therefore essential to quantify all factors that influence the energy conversion efficiency. The air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> is a key factor for the overall efficiency of the open volumetric receiver. It is the fraction of the blown out air which is sucked in again through the solar receiver. To achieve a high receiver efficiency it is therefore important to increase the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> Many variables such as wind speed and direction, geometry of the receiver design and operational mode influence the air flow in front of the receiver. This in turn influences the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> It is therefore of vital importance to be able to measure the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> and furthermore visualize the air flow in front of the receiver. The air return value was prior to this work unknown on a large scale and under concentrated solar irradiation. The development of a measurement technique for the quantification of the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> with maximum accuracy is the main objective of this thesis. The second objective lies in the visualization of the returned air. This improves the understanding of the occurring flow phenomena which govern the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> The measurement methods were developed at a lab scale, tested under operating conditions and successfully demonstrated at the solar tower Jülich. In order to measure the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio,</b> three variants of a novel circular tracer gas measurement technique have been developed. The tracer gas is injected either continuously or intermittently into the open air system. The tracer gas is diluted by the imperfect air <b>return</b> <b>ratio.</b> The mole fraction of the injected noble gas helium is measured with a mass spectrometer within the air system, from which the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> is determined. A temporal resolution of 0. 5 s has been achieved. A maximal air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> of (68. 6 ± 0. 7) % with 95 % confidence interval has been measured during irradiation with concentrated sunlight at the solar tower power plant Jülich. This is higher than thepreviously assumed air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> of 60 %. This difference corresponds to a 4 − 5 % higher overall system efficiency. The return air in front of the receiver was visualized for the first time with the newly developed Induced Infrared Thermography. Hereby, carbon dioxide is added to the return air. This induces a larger amount of radiationbeing given off in the infrared region. This radiation from the return air is visualized using an infrared camera...|$|R

Although first measurements of the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> exist for smaller setups of the open volumetric receiver concept, so far no measurement of the air <b>return</b> <b>ratio</b> has been presented for the Solar Thermal Test and Demonstration Power Plant Jülich (1. 5 MW, 10 (kg air) /s; 700 °C). This paper describes {{the application of a}} tracer gas method at the Solar Tower Jülich to determine this substantial ARR. As tracer gas the environmentally friendly helium has been chosen.
