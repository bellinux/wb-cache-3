50|$|In 1988, {{after the}} verdict, a need was felt {{to make a}} lasting {{arrangement}} {{for the long term}} management of Auroville. The city's representatives along with Sh. Kireet Joshi, then Educational Advisor to the Union government met for consultations with the then Prime Minister, Rajiv Gandhi. Later that year, the Auroville Foundation Act 1988, was passed by the Indian Parliament. The Act stipulated the vesting of all movable and immovable assets of the city in a foundation, known as Auroville Foundation {{and the creation of a}} three-tier governing system: the Governing Board; the Residents' Assembly and the Auroville International Advisory Council. The highest authority is the Governing Board selected by the Government of India. Consisting of 7 individuals, they are all prominent Indians in the fields of education, culture, environment and social service. The second authority is the International Advisory Council whose 5 members are also selected by the Government. These are chosen from amongst people who have rendered valuable service to humanity in the areas of Auroville’s ideals. The <b>Resident's</b> <b>Assembly</b> consists of all official residents of the city.|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of a case study on the psychosocial health of the residents of the Scheldebuurt, a neighbourhood in Ghent (Belgium) that is confronted with groundwater contamination (N= 138). More specifically, we concentrate on the role of communication between neighbours in explaining their psychosocial health. A first analysis points out that the mental health of residents does not significantly differ from that of the general Belgian population. Subsequently, the article examines to what extent the psychosocial health of the local residents, measured by both perceived stress and mental health, varies according to differences in risk perception, concerns related to the pollution and neighbourhood communication. The results show that risk perception has a negative effect on mental health, however, only if residents received information about the contamination through neighbours or <b>residents</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This indicates that communication between neighbours needs {{to be taken into account}} when examining the psychosocial health of a population confronted with environmental contamination. The effects of both risk perception and concerns related to the pollution on the perceived stress are not dependent of neighbourhood communication. In the discussion we explain the most important findings and give some suggestions for future research...|$|R
50|$|It {{was from}} Laurvig {{that he was}} elected to the Constitutional Assembly. As the legal {{secretary}} of the Constitutional Committee, he played an important part in shaping the language of the Norwegian Constitution. Diriks was the <b>Assembly's</b> <b>resident</b> expert on foreign constitutions, and emphasized civil liberties. He was responsible for the inclusion of §100, concerning freedom of speech, and §102, guarding against unreasonable searches and seizures. He was later made president of the Assembly, with responsibility for passing the Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|The Cascade virus (also {{known as}} Herbstlaub in Germany) is a {{prominent}} computer virus {{that was a}} <b>resident</b> written in <b>assembly,</b> and it was widespread in the 1980s and early 1990s. It infected [...]COM files and {{had the effect of}} making text on the screen fall down and form a heap {{in the bottom of the}} screen. It was notable for using an encryption algorithm to avoid being detected. However one could see that infected files had their size increased by 1701 or 1704 bytes. In response, IBM developed its own antivirus software.|$|R
50|$|The {{people of}} Rema also wanted solar panels. After a {{thorough}} training {{of a number}} of local <b>residents</b> for the <b>assembly,</b> installation and maintenance of solar panels, 1100 units were installed in 2007. Microfinance allowed the residents to pay the costs. In the year 2011, 2200 units were installed. Except for lighting with LED lamps for street lighting, in homes and schools - especially for evening adult education - solar energy is used for water pumps, disinfection of water, fridges and TVs. Because no kerosene is used anymore for lighting, the number of complaints as a result of smoke (lung problems) is reduced.|$|R
5|$|During the Georgian era Bath became fashionable, and {{the architects}} John Wood, the Elder, and his son, John Wood the Younger, laid out new areas of housing for <b>residents</b> and visitors. <b>Assembly</b> rooms {{had been built}} early in the 18th century, but a new venue for balls, concerts and {{gambling}} was envisaged in the area between Queen Square, The Circus and the Royal Crescent. Robert Adam submitted a proposal that was rejected as too expensive. John Wood, the Younger raised funding through a Tontine and construction started in 1769. The New or Upper Assembly Rooms opened with a grand ball in 1771 and became the hub of fashionable society, being frequented by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens, along with the nobility of the time.|$|R
40|$|With the 2008 Presidential {{elections}} {{right around}} the corner, the American healthcare system has become a hot topic on everyone's tips. According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks thirty-seventh {{in the world for}} healthcare in terms of overall quality and fairness. However, the United States has the most innovative research, the best-equipped hospitals, and the best medical education in the world. In the spring 2008 I, along with thirteen other students at the Virginia B. Ball Center for Creative Inquiry, set out to discover what Hoosiers think about the current state of heatthcare in our nation. Throughout the semester I have researched the state of heatthcare around the world, helped design, execute, and analyze a poll on healthcare for Delaware County <b>residents,</b> planned an <b>assembly</b> in which experts on healthcare spoke and participants from the poll attended, and aided telecommunication students in making a documentary on healthcare. Included in my thesis is an analysis on my experience at the Virginia Ball Center, the results of the poll, a copy of the documentary and meta film, as well as other documents I have created over the semester.

50|$|The Norwegian {{constitution}} {{was inspired by}} the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the French revolution in 1789 and the subsequent U.S. and French constitutions. The authors Christian Magnus Falsen and Johan Gunder Adler were also influenced by the Spanish Constitution of 1812. A deviation from the republican constitutions of France and the USA was the retention of monarchy. Importing republicanism was seen as an attempt to emulate the French and Americans directly, something the lawmakers at Eidsvoll sought to avoid. The choice of monarchy as state form would also facilitate reunification of Denmark-Norway, something the Crown Prince was not alone in seeking. The king's power was however severely curtailed. His absolute veto over laws was removed. The council of Eidsvoll chose, not surprisingly, Crown Prince Christian Frederik as king. He was thus chosen, and as such a king by {{the will of the people}} rather than by the grace of God. In a Europe where almost all countries were ruled by absolute monarchy, this was seen as extremely radical. Christian Adolph Diriks, who was the legal secretary of the Constitutional Committee, was the <b>assembly's</b> <b>resident</b> expert on foreign constitutions, and played an important part in shaping the language of the constitution. Diriks is credited with formulating §100, concerning freedom of speech, and §102, guarding against unreasonable searches and seizures.|$|R
40|$|This policy brief {{highlights}} {{the differences in}} uninurance rates among the new California Assembly and Senate districts resulting from redistricting based on the 2000 Census. Funded by The California Endowment, this report is particularly relevant at this time when the lack of health insurance has moved higher on political agendas {{at the state and}} national levels. Uninsured rates at the district levels are estimates created by a small-area-methodology with data from 2001 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS 2001), the March 2000 - 2002 Current Population Surveys, and the 2000 Census. This first-of-its-kind information contributes valuable and timely data needed by California’s community and health advocacy groups as well as legislators to support their respective policy development roles and to inform and focus their efforts on high-priority health and medical care issues, locally and statewide. In addition to the data presented in this policy brief, several supplemental California Assembly and Senate exhibits (tables and maps) are available on this Web site: maps by district of uninsured rates for children (ages 0 - 17) and for adults (ages 18 - 64); demographic tables of district population distributions by race/ethnicity and income-to-poverty ratios; and confidence intervals (or precision estimates) for the published uninsured rates. Among the key findings are: Rates of uninsurance are particularly acute in legislative districts located in the Central Valley and in Southern California. There are substantial geographic disparities in health insurance coverage for children and adults among the newly redrawn California Assembly and Senate districts. Legislative district uninsured rates range from a low of 7 % for children ages 0 - 17 in Assembly District 15 to a high of 50 % for adults ages 18 - 64 in Assembly District 46. Even the districts with the lowest rates of uninsurance have a considerable number of uninsured <b>residents.</b> For example, <b>Assembly</b> District 15 has 38, 000 uninsured persons under age 65, and the Senate District with the lowest rate of uninsurance (SD 7) is home to 78, 000 persons under age 65 who have no insurance. Key Policy Recommendation More extensive outreach efforts must be implemented to ensure that all children and adults who are eligible for public programs get enrolled into them. The findings in this brief identify the locations in the state where outreach and enrollment efforts can be most effective...|$|R
