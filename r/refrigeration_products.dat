40|$|This paper {{analysed}} {{the fracture}} of a connecting rod from a food <b>product</b> <b>refrigeration</b> compressor.

Connecting rod loads are compressive in normal operating conditions; however, an increased friction coefficient induces flexion load. Based on the connecting rod’s microstructures, fracture surface characterisation and stress state estimation, {{it was concluded that}} the failure originated in a breakdown of connecting rod-crankshaft lubrication causing scuffing, severe wear and a high friction coe- fficient. Likewise, the results showed that when the friction coefficient increased to 0. 4, then stress reached levels above those acceptable for the connecting rod material (molten aluminium-silicon alloy) being considered. Manufacture defects, pores and cracks increased stress concentration, thereby contributing to the mechanical element’s failure...|$|R

A mean energy consumption rate of 2. 7 Â kW/TEU was assumed in this study, but was found to have potential variations of around Â± 60 %. New Zealand's maritime trade was considered as a case study for the year 2007 to place the effect of refrigerated transport in context. For individual refrigerated containers, approximately 19 % of the energy use related to its journey is used for refrigeration purposes. In 2007, approximately 18 % and 61 % of New Zealand's imported and exported food products by mass, respectively, required some form of refrigeration during transportation. Maintaining the refrigerated state of imports and exports to and from New Zealand during maritime transportation consumed approximately 280 Â GWh of electricity. Assuming all this electricity was generated onboard vessels using auxiliary engines, approximately 61 Â kt of fuel was consumed and 190 Â kt of CO 2 produced.

40|$|Purpose of review: This review summarises {{advances}} {{in the application of}} mathematical models for predicting and optimising fluid flow, heat and mass transfer and associated phenomena during postharvest <b>refrigeration</b> of horticultural <b>products.</b> Findings: There has been an interest in the use of mathematical models for optimising postharvest refrigeration systems operation and design. These mathematical models are applied to predict the physical and chemical phenomena that take place during postharvest handling of horticultural products. Nowadays, with the availability of more powerful computers at a reasonable price, it is feasible to investigate the details of the flow behaviour in large-scale refrigeration systems at a very small spatial and temporal scale. Directions for future research: In most of the recent models, the stored product along with the container was assumed as a porous medium. With this assumption, {{it is not possible to}} predict the detailed flow behaviour through the container and around each product in the container. To date the turbulence dynamics in the stack has not been properly investigated. In order to improve the accuracy of the models, models that include the detailed geometry of the stacked product and the container, and the use of better turbulence models will be very important. To better understand the phenomena at all levels of the refrigeration process, a multiscale modelling approach is required. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Refrigeration {{systems in}} {{supermarkets}} and convenience stores operate continuously to maintain proper product storage conditions, and these refrigeration systems {{can account for}} 40 % {{or more of the}} electrical energy consumption of a supermarket or convenience store. Â Peak refrigeration system electricity demand typically occurs during the afternoon and summer months, corresponding to when the general demand and price for electricity are the highest. Â In order to reduce peak demand and its associated costs, {{it may be possible to}} shift refrigeration system electrical energy use by utilizing the thermal mass of the stored <b>product.</b> <b>Refrigeration</b> system capacities vary from 30 - 60 KW in small store to over 400 KW for large stores with annual energy consumption varying from 1 - 1. 5 million kWh. During early morning hours, when electricity demand and price are lower and refrigeration system efficiency is greater, the temperature set point of the refrigeration system can be reduced in order to pre-cool the stored products to below their normal storage temperature. Â Subsequently, refrigeration system operation can be reduced during the mid to late afternoon when electricity demand and price are high, and product temperature may be allowed to drift upwards. Â This operating strategy is particularly feasible with products that are not adversely affected by variations in temperature, such as water and canned or bottled beverages. The key to utilizing the thermal storage is to understand the storage potential and associated time constants of the display cases. To determine the feasibility of reducing peak demand by shifting the refrigeration load to off-peak times, experimental and analytical analyses were performed. Â Simulated product, consisting of one-pint containers filled with a 50 % ethylene glycol and 50 % water solution, were stored in a medium-temperature vertical open refrigerated display case. Â Product temperature rise as a function of time was determined by turning off the refrigeration to the display case, while product temperature pull-down time was subsequently determined by turning on the refrigeration to the display case. Â It was found that the thermal mass of the product in the display case was such that during a 2. 5 hour period with no <b>refrigeration,</b> the average <b>product</b> temperature increased by 10 Â°F. Â In addition, it took approximately 3. 5 hours for the product to recover to its initial temperature after the refrigeration was turned on. Using transient heat conduction analyses for one-dimensional objects (such as infinite slabs, infinite cylinders, or spheres), cooling or heating times of various objects may be estimated. Â For example, analytical methods predict that heating a cylindrical product by 10 Â°F (from 30 Â°F to 40 Â°F) would take approximately 2. 2 hours, which is in good agreement with the experimental results obtained in this study. Â From the analysis, it appears that the thermal mass of the stored product in refrigerated display cases is sufficient to allow product temperatures to safely drift for a significant time under reduced refrigeration system operation. Â Thus, strategies for shifting refrigeration system electrical demand can be developed. Â The use of an advanced refrigeration system controller that can respond to utility signals can enable demand shifting with minimal impact...|$|R
40|$|Deterministic models {{describing}} {{heat transfer}} and microbial {{growth in the}} cold chain are widely studied. However, {{it is difficult to}} apply them in practice because of several variable parameters in the logistic supply chain (e. g., ambient temperature varying due to season and product residence time in <b>refrigeration</b> equipment), the <b>product's</b> characteristics (e. g., pH and water activity) and the microbial characteristics (e. g., initial microbial load and lag time). This variability can lead to different bacterial growth rates in food products and has to be considered to properly predict the consumer's exposure and identify the key parameters of the cold chain. This study proposes a new approach that combines deterministic (heat transfer) and stochastic (Monte Carlo) modeling to account for the variability in the logistic supply chain and the product's characteristics. The model generates a realistic time-temperature product history, contrary to existing modeling whose describe time-temperature profile Contrary to existing approaches that use directly a time-temperature profile, the proposed model predicts product temperature evolution from the thermostat setting and the ambient temperature. The developed methodology was applied to the cold chain of cooked ham including, the display cabinet, transport by the consumer and the domestic refrigerator, to predict the evolution of state variables, such as the temperature and the growth of Listeria monocytogenes. The impacts of the input factors were calculated and ranked. It was found that the product's time-temperature history and the initial contamination level are the main causes of consumers' exposure. Then, a refined analysis was applied, revealing the importance of consumer behaviors on Listeria monocytogenes exposure...|$|R
