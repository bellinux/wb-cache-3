40|$|This article {{proposed}} a psychological mechanism for improving future work motivation by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences. Previous studies {{have claimed that}} future motivation is maintained by present self-affirmation and a future ideal, and have overlooked the effect of <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences. Rather, it has been claimed that <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences leads to overconfidence or anxiety, and impairs future motivation. In contrast, this article points out that people can maintain motivation through (1) imagining clearly their future ideal selves (setting goals), (2) <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences related to the ideal, and (3) acquiring lessons from the past. In a review of previous studies, we examined the process of <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences to improve future motivation. We showed that people with a clear ideal (goal) <b>reflected</b> <b>on</b> past experiences related to that ideal, and acquired lessons and mental rewards from the past, thus improving their motivation. A new mechanism for maintaining work motivation by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> past experiences was presented, taking into consideration acquired lessons and mental rewards...|$|R

30|$|The {{value of}} {{experiencing}} will increase by <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> the experiences repeatedly {{over time and}} thinking about the meanings of experiences, especially in experience-based learning such as programming education. John Dewey said, ‘We do not learn from experience itself. We learn from <b>reflecting</b> <b>on</b> experience.’ In fact, during a class of ‘integrated studies’ at elementary schools, children often create a portfolio which supports them to <b>reflect</b> <b>on</b> their learning activities.|$|R

In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them.

Hank realizes he cannot use the money without being caught; he goes home and burns it all.

As of 2015 this has not occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer Alexander Goehr was performed at London's Royal Opera House on 15 September 1995, under the title Arianna. Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, {{as a tribute to}} the historic opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.|$|E
