40|$|The {{thesis is}} {{generally}} focused on summarization {{of the information}} related to the high activity sealed sources of ionizing radiation, known as HASS, which are widely used {{in a variety of}} sectors in whole world and the Czech Republic as well. The thesis discusses specific cases of actual use <b>of</b> <b>HASS,</b> technical specification, types of occurring radionuclides and examples of use. The biological effects of ionizing radiation on humans related to HASS and some examples of specific adverse events are also described. In the intentions of this thesis is to take into account not only risks arising from incorrect manipulation, but also risks associated with potentially abuse <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> by terrorist organization. For these reasons, the thesis outlines the basic security requirements associated to the international standards and also mentioned in legislation of CR. In connection with these requirements the suggestion of particular security system on specific workplaces with HASS is than discussed. To supplement the reader's imagination of the real problems <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> in the Czech Republic, there is created a statistical overview <b>of</b> all <b>HASS</b> located in the Czech Republic. This includes the total number <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> and the largest area of use devided into various areas of application (medicine, industry, research/education, etc.), representation of most commonly used radionuclides, the geographical distribution <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> in the Czech Republic and the distribution in terms of the most common activities. The State Office for Nuclear Safety Registry was used as a source for this statistical overview. In the discussion part of the thesis, the real possibility <b>of</b> abuse <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> and also a possible ways of gain {{from the perspective of a}} potential lone striker or a wider terrorist organization is discussed. In general, the following thesis is a logical synthesis of relevant information allowing the reader to obtain a relatively comprehensive view on the whole issue <b>of</b> <b>HASS,</b> especially from the perspective of the broader field of radiation protection emphasized on achieving a socially acceptable security level of all high activity sources of ionizing radiation...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{importance}} of humanities {{and social sciences}} in the development of empathetic and effective physicians has been documented in the literature. At AKU, Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies have been mandatory components of the medical curriculum as per Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) requirements since the inception of the college. The Humanities and Social Sciences (HASS) program in the medical curriculum was introduced in 2008. It has evolved from being limited to Pakistan and Islamic Studies to including electives in foreign languages, literature, sociology, film, music, fine arts, photography etc. The main two strands of Pakistan Studies and Islamic Studies continue, but with emphasis on critical appraisal of history and respect for all religions of Pakistan. Methods: This study is a review of the history and evolution <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> at AKU and the associated opportunities and challenges that allowed for the development <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> as it is today using the following methodology: 1. Review of documents relevant to the shaping <b>of</b> <b>HASS.</b> 2. Key interviews of faculty members and senior leadership involved in the policy-level discourse that paved the way for introduction <b>of</b> a broader <b>HASS</b> curriculum in the Medical College at AKU. Results: The study is currently in progress, but anecdotal and preliminary evidence reveals institutional recognition of the {{importance of}} humanities education in the medical curriculum. Conclusions: The experience <b>of</b> <b>HASS</b> academic team in the evolution and development <b>of</b> the current <b>HASS</b> program in the medical college at AKU will be shared. The importance of {{humanities and social sciences}} in the medical curriculum will be discussed in light of WHOâ€™s focus on social determinants of health, and social accountability of medical education.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} the prevalence and predictors <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> practical support among {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS) survivors during the early post-discharge period.

Demographic, clinical, functional, and psychosocial predictors of instrumental and informational practical support were examined. RESULTS: 81 % of participants reported receiving practical support during the early post-discharge period: 75 % reported <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> instrumental support and 51 % reported <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> informational support.

40|$|A {{disproportionate number}} of cancer deaths occur among racial/ethnic minorities, {{particularly}} African Americans, who have a 33 % higher risk of dying of cancer than whites. Although differences in incidence and stage of disease at diagnosis may contribute to racial disparities in mortality, evidence of racial disparities in the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> treatment of other chronic diseases {{raises questions about the}} possible role of inequities in the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> cancer treatment. To evaluate racial/ethnic disparities in the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> cancer treatment, we examined the published literature that addressed access/use of specific cancer treatment procedures, trends in patterns of use, or survival studies. We found evidence of racial disparities in <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> definitive primary therapy, conservative therapy, and adjuvant therapy. These treatment differences could not be completely explained by racial/ethnic variation in clinically relevant factors. In many studies, these treatment differences were associated with an adverse impact on the health outcomes of racial/ethnic minorities, including more frequent recurrence, shorter disease-free survival, and higher mortality. Reducing the influence of nonclinical factors on the <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> cancer treatment may, therefore, provide an important means of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in health. New data resources and improved study methodology are needed to better identify and quantify the full spectrum of nonclinical factors that contribute to the higher cancer mortality among racial/ethnic minorities and to develop strategies to facilitate <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> appropriate cancer care for all patients...|$|R

Minority-serving status, low bed size, for-profit ownership, non-teaching status, high competition, low density of plastic surgeons in the market and non-metropolitan location are associated with lower likelihood <b>of</b> <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> IBRS. Racial and ethnic minorities are less likely to receive IBRS. A mixed effects logistic regression model with interactions between Black/Hispanic race/ethnicity and hospital variables is estimated to examine whether certain hospital characteristics are associated with disparately low <b>receipt</b> <b>of</b> IBRS for racial and ethnic minorities.
