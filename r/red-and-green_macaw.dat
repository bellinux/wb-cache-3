50|$|The green-winged macaw (Ara chloropterus), {{also known}} as the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw,</b> is a large, mostly-red macaw of the Ara genus.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} length, this species {{is second only}} in size to the {{hyacinth}} macaw, {{the largest of the}} macaws. The <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> attains a total body length of 90 to 95 cm in adults. Twelve adults were found to average 1214 g. A weight range of between 1050 and 1708 g has been reported. While its weight range is broadly {{similar to that of the}} hyacinth, the average weight of the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> is slightly surpassed by both the hyacinth and great green macaws, and amongst all living parrots additionally by the kakapo.|$|E
5000|$|Buraco das Araras {{is a huge}} {{sandstone}} crater, a {{geological formation}} resulting from the collapse of boulders creating this enormous cavity of about 500 m in circumference and 100 m deep located {{in the middle of}} the cerrado in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. It is home to a wide variety of birds, especially araçari toucans and <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaws,</b> hence the name of the cave.|$|R
50|$|Based {{on growth}} rate data {{for more than}} 60 wild macaw nestlings in natural nests, {{researchers}} were able to plot growth curves for healthy nestlings and curves for nestlings that eventually died of malnutrition or disease. Once it was determined which nestlings probably would die, these nestlings were removed, handfed for months and released near TRC, thereby increasing the reproductive output of the wild population. Between 1992-1994 breeding seasons {{a variety of methods}} of rescuing and hand-raising of otherwise doomed nestlings were tested at TRC. In the period of 1992-1995, 6 blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna), 5 <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaws</b> (Ara chloropterus), and 21 scarlet macaws (Ara macao) were hand-raised and released into the wild population. These individuals later became called as “Chicos” (the kids). At this time TRC was only a 40x12 m building. These birds fledged and gradually integrated themselves into the wild macaw population.|$|R
40|$|The {{selection}} of molecular markers for population studies {{is an important}} tool for biodiversity conservation. The family Psittacidae contains many endangered and vulnerable species and we tested three kinds of molecular markers for their potential use in population studies of five psitacid species: 43 hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus), 42 blue-and-yellow macaws (Ara ararauna), 23 <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaws</b> (Ara chloroptera), 19 red-spectacled amazons (Amazona pretrei); and 18 red-tailed amazons (Amazona brasiliensis). We tested 21 clones from a genomic library of golden conure (Guarouba guarouba) minisatellites and 12 pairs of microsatellite primers developed for the domestic chicken (Gallus gallus) and A. hyacinthinus. We also tested seven tetranucleotide repeat primers {{for their ability to}} amplify regions between microsatellite loci (inter simple sequence repeats, ISSRs). We were able to select seven markers that were variable in different degrees for three species (A. hyacinthinus, A. chloroptera and A. ararauna). The mini and microsatellites produced more polymorphic patterns than the ISSRs. The genetic variability of the species studied seems to be correlated with their endangered status...|$|R
50|$|Birds {{found in}} the area include: the golden-green woodpecker, the sunbittern, the king vulture, the {{undulated}} tinamou, the green ibis, the harpy eagle, the white-necked jacobin, the white-throated toucan, the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw,</b> the red-throated caracara, the muscovy duck, the agami heron, etc.|$|E
50|$|Parrots and toucans {{displayed}} {{outside the}} walking {{area of the}} park include African grey parrot, scarlet macaw, blue-and-yellow macaw, military macaw, great green macaw, hyacinth macaw, <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw,</b> Catalina macaw, white cockatoo, salmon-crested cockatoo, galah, Alexandrine parakeet, princess parrot, channel-billed toucan, and white-throated toucan.|$|E
50|$|The fauna {{includes}} animals {{like the}} capybara (which {{is the biggest}} rodent in the world), the giant armadillo, the jaguar, the giant otter, and the red brocket deer. There are also numerous species of birds, including the white-throated toucan, the hoatzin, and the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw.</b> Animals {{that live in the}} water include the Arapaima, and the amazonian manatee.|$|E
40|$|The Psittacidae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} families of birds in the world. Knowledge of its nutrition is important for understanding their survival and productivity in the wild, as well as for their adequate husbandry in captivity. Hand-rearing is a common practice for this group. However, research on their requirements is limited. Analysis of the crop content of chicks can provide new insights into psittacine nutrition, but it is limited by the small sizes of samples which can be obtained. We sampled the crops from free-living chicks of scarlet <b>macaws</b> and <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaws</b> from southeastern Peru, Cuban parrots from the Bahamas, lilac-crowned parrots from northwestern Mexico, and thick-billed parrots from northern Mexico. The predicted metabolizable energy, protein, fat, minerals, profile of essential amino acids and profile of fatty acids of the crop samples, as well as from 15 commercial hand-rearing formulas, were analyzed and contrasted. Near Infrared Spectroscopy was shown to be a valid technique for the nondestructive, low cost prediction of a variety of nutritional attributes of crop samples as small as 0. 5 g dry weight, expanding the possibilities of wild animal nutrition research. The diets of the five studied species presented remarkable similarities and common patterns. The predicted dietary metabolizable energy and fat concentrations were particularly similar among species, the thick-billed parrot being the one with the most unique nutrient profile. The fatty acid profile of the crop contents differed markedly among genera, with the thick-billed parrot closer to the macaws than to the parrots. In comparison with the crop samples, the hand feeding formulas presented lower fat, Mg, arginine, and valine concentrations. The wide variation in nutrients suggests that there is not yet a consensus among manufacturers concerning the correct nutrition for growing psittacines. It is suggested that a single formulation could be used to hand-rear macaws and parrots from half its nesting time to fledging, and further research should focus on their nutrition during the first half. Our results suggest that manufacturers should evaluate if increasing the concentrations of crude fat, Mg, arginine, and valine in commercial formulas enhances psittacine chick growth and health...|$|R

50|$|After almost two-hundred years {{absence from}} Argentina, the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara chloropterus) {{is the subject}} of a re-introduction programme. The species is listed as {{critically}} endangered in Argentina, although there are no recent records, and it is considered to be extinct in the country. It is listed as a ″a species of global least concern″ on the IUCN Red List. The first birds were released in 2015 by Aves Argentinas, a partner of BirdLife International.|$|E
5000|$|Great green macaws are {{the largest}} parrots in their natural range, the second {{heaviest}} macaw species (although are relatively shorter tailed than other large macaws such as the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> and are thus somewhat shorter), and the third heaviest parrot species in the world. This species averages 85 - 90 cm in length and 1.3 kg in weight. [...] They are mainly green and have a reddish forehead and pale blue lower back, rump and upper tail feathers. Tail is brownish red tipped with very pale blue. The bare facial skin is patterned with lines of small dark feathers, which are reddish in older and female parrots.|$|E
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} is a wintering {{place or}} feeding place for {{many species of}} birds.It provides the main winter habitat for species such as northern pintail (Anas acuta), American wigeon (Anas americana), northern shoveler (Anas clypeata), cinnamon teal (Anas cyanoptera), blue-winged teal (Anas discors), and osprey (Pandion haliaetus). Native species include great green macaw (Ara ambiguus), military macaw (Ara militaris), blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna), scarlet macaw (Ara macao), <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara chloroptera) chestnut-fronted macaw (Ara severus), northern screamer (Chauna chavaria), Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), knob-billed duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos), black-bellied whistling duck (Dendrocygna autumnalis), white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata), fulvous whistling duck (Dendrocygna bicolor), black hawk-eagle (Spizaetus tyrannus), crested eagle (Morphnus guianensis), harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti).Endangered birds include the recurve-billed bushbird (Clytoctantes alixii) and blue-billed curassow (Crax alberti).|$|E
5000|$|The {{harpy eagle}} is an {{actively}} hunting carnivore {{and is an}} apex predator. Adults are {{near the top of}} a food chain but are preyed upon by ocelots and jaguars. Its main prey are tree-dwelling mammals and a majority of the diet has been shown to focus on sloths and monkeys. Research conducted by Aguiar-Silva between 2003 and 2005 in a nesting site in Parintins, Amazonas, Brazil, collected remains from prey offered to the nestling by its parents and after sorting them, concluded, in terms of individuals preyed upon, the harpy's prey basis was composed in 79% by sloths from two species: Bradypus variegatus amounting to 39% of the individual prey base, and Choloepus didactylus to 40%; various monkeys amounted to 11.6% of the same prey base. In a similar research venture in Panama, where a couple of captive-bred subadults was released, 52% of the male's captures and 54% of the female's were of two sloth species (Bradypus variegatus and Choloepus hoffmanni). At one Venezuelan nest, the remains comprised sloths. Monkeys regularly taken can include capuchin monkeys, saki monkeys, howler monkeys, titi monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and spider monkeys. Smaller monkeys, such as tamarins and marmosets, are seemingly ignored as prey by this species. At several nest in Guyana, monkeys made up about 37% of the prey remains found at the nests. Similarly, cebid monkeys made up 35% of the remains found at 10 nests in Amazonian Ecuador. Other partially arboreal and even land mammals are also preyed on given the opportunity, including porcupines, squirrels, opossums, anteaters, armadillos, and even relatively large carnivores such as kinkajous, coatis, and tayras. In the Pantanal, a pair of nesting eagles preyed largely on the porcupine (Coendou prehensilis) and the agouti (Dasyprocta azarae). The eagle may also attack bird species such as macaws: At the Parintins research site, the <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> made up for 0.4% of the prey base, with other birds amounting to 4.6%." [...] Other parrots have also been preyed on, as well as cracids such as curassows and seriemas. Additional prey items reported include reptiles such as iguanas, tejus, and snakes. Snakes up to 5 cm in diameter have been observed to be cut in half, then the pieces are swallowed whole. On occasion, larger prey such as capybaras, peccaries, and deer are taken and they are usually taken to a stump or low branch and partially eaten, since they are too heavy to be carried whole to the nest. Red brocket deer, a species commonly weighing over 30 kg, have been reportedly taken and, in such cases, the eagle may have to tear it into pieces or feed on it at the killing site rather than fly with it, as it would be too heavy. The harpy has been recorded as taking domestic livestock, including chickens, lambs, goats, and young pigs, but this is extremely rare under normal circumstances. They control the population of mesopredators such as capuchin monkeys which prey extensively on bird's eggs and which (if not naturally controlled) may cause local extinctions of sensitive species.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{ecology of}} seed {{dispersal}} {{is critical to}} understand the patterns of distribution and abundance of plant species. We investigated seed dispersal aspects associated with the high abundance of Buchenavia tomentosa in the Serra Azul State Park (PESA). We estimated fruit production and conducted fruit removal experiments. We carried out diurnal and nocturnal observations on frugivory as well as germination tests. Fruiting occurred in the dry season and totaled 1, 365, 015 ± 762, 670 fruits. ha– 1. B. tomentosa fruits were utilized by eight animal species. The lowland tapir (Tapirus terrestris) was considered the main seed disperser. Leafcutter ants (Atta laevigata and Atta sexdens) participated in the seed cleaning and occasionally dispersed seeds. The beetle Amblycerus insuturatus, blue-and-yellow macaw (Ara ararauna) and <b>red-and-green</b> <b>macaw</b> (Ara chloropterus) were considered pre-dispersal seed predators. The seeds manually cleaned presented higher germination rate (100 %) and speed index (4. 2 seeds. d– 1) than that of seeds with pulp. Germination of seeds found in tapirs’feces was 40 %, while for the seeds without pulp it was 25 %. The high abundance of B. tomentosa in the cerrado of PESA {{may be due to}} massive fruit production, low rates of seed predation, and efficient seed dispersal by tapirs, occurring before the rains which promote germination and recruitment of this species...|$|E
