5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s British {{intelligence}} {{learned that the}} ANO held accounts with the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) in London. BCCI was closed in July 1991 by banking regulators in six countries after evidence emerged of widespread fraud. Abu Nidal himself {{was said to have}} visited London using the name Shakar Farhan; a BCCI branch manager, who passed information about the ANO accounts to MI5, reportedly drove him around several stores in London without realizing who he was. Abu Nidal was using a company called SAS International Trading and Investments in Warsaw as cover for arms deals. The company's transactions included the purchase of <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> ostensibly for Syria, then when the British refused an export licence to Syria, for an African state; in fact half the shipment went to the police in East Germany and half to Abu Nidal.|$|E
25|$|The union's {{leadership}} {{had chosen}} to use different tactics in this strike; it ordered its members to picket without carrying any clubs or weapons of any sort. The police, on the other hand, armed themselves with <b>riot</b> <b>guns</b> which sprayed buckshot over a wide arc.|$|E

500|$|After the war, a shorter-barrelled {{version of}} the Model 1897 was marketed by Winchester as a riot gun. Messengers of The American Express Company were armed with this weapon as were various police {{departments}} throughout the US. [...] The differences between this riot version and the trench version were the riot version lacked the heat shield and bayonet lug, and all trench guns were equipped with sling swivels, whereas most <b>riot</b> <b>guns</b> were not.|$|E
2500|$|Most <b>riot</b> <b>guns</b> are {{chambered}} in 12-gauge and {{can handle}} either 2.75" [...] "standard-length" [...] or 3" [...] "magnum" [...] cartridges. Most non-shotshell loads, such as less lethal ammunition like bean bags, are made only in 12-gauge. However, 20-gauge and [...]410 shotguns in riot gun configuration are available. Smaller bores are popular for home defense, as the reduced power and recoil {{make them more}} suitable for less experienced shooters who may be more recoil-sensitive.|$|E
2500|$|During World War II, Stevens began {{producing}} {{both the}} Model 520A (renamed the Model 520-30) and the Model 620A (labeled as the Model 620) as trench guns, <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> and long-barreled training guns for the US military. [...] Trench guns were produced with 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) {{and had a}} heat shield with a unique pinkish anodized bayonet lug attached {{to the front of}} the barrel (late war examples had a small [...] "S" [...] stamped on the left side). [...] The receivers of both models were stamped on the left side (from front to back) with a small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb, [...] "Model 520-30" [...] or [...] "Model 620", and a small [...] "U.S." [...] over the trigger. [...] Model 520-30 trench gun barrels are marked [...] "Proof Tested--12 Gauge --2 3/4 Inch Chamber--" [...] on the left side and have another small [...] "P" [...] and ordnance bomb and the [...] "J Stevens Arms Company" [...] address on the right side of the barrel. [...] This was done so that all the markings could be read with the heat shield installed. [...] Some Model 620 trench gun barrels were marked in the same manner as the Model 520-30 trench guns and some had all the barrel markings on the left side. [...] Trench guns were also fitted with a sling swivel in the stock. [...] <b>Riot</b> <b>guns</b> also had 20 inch barrels (cylinder bore) and had all the same martial markings, except that all the barrel markings were on the left side. [...] The long barreled training guns were marked in the same manner as <b>riot</b> <b>guns</b> and were mainly used for aerial gunnery training. [...] Total wartime production of all Model 520-30 shotguns was 33,306 and all Model 620 shotguns was 12,174. [...] After the war the US military standardized both the Model 520-30 and the Model 620 and kept them in the inventory. [...] They were used in the Korean War and as late as the Vietnam War.|$|E

2500|$|The most influential—and ultimately, controversial—aspect of MSUG {{technical}} assistance {{was in the}} field of police administration, where the group supplied not only consulting and training services, but also material aid. In general, MSUG was responsible for distributing U.S. aid, provided through USOM, until 1959 when USOM established its own police staff. MSUG staff acted as consultants to determine the needs of the police groups—and then tranacted the procurements themselves. The matériel included [...] "revolvers, <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> ammunition, tear gas, jeeps and other vehicles, handcuffs, office equipment, traffic lights, and communications equipment".|$|E
2500|$|To {{enforce the}} injunction, 54 [...] "special" [...] sheriff's deputies were hired and sworn in. The deputies' {{salaries}} were {{paid for by}} the growers. Although the deputies technically remained {{under the supervision of the}} Hardin County sheriff, the deputies were under the control of the growers and their field foremen. [...] Most of the special sheriff's deputies were members of the Hardin County detachment of the Ohio National Guard and veterans of the Auto-Lite strike in nearby Toledo, which had only recently ended. The National Guard troops, most of whom were only 18 years old, were determined not to be intimidated by the picketers as they had been in Toledo. The newly appointed special deputies were armed with <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> machine guns, and tear gas equipment from the National Guard armory in Kenton, Ohio.|$|E
2500|$|Configurations of grips {{and stocks}} for riot {{shotguns}} vary widely, but often feature reinforced plastic [...] "furniture" [...] {{instead of the}} wood common on hunting firearms. Wood was used for riot gun stocks in the past, and sometimes still is. As compared to hunting shotguns, <b>riot</b> <b>guns</b> more often feature pistol grips, {{with or without a}} shoulder stock. Without a shoulder stock (or with a folding stock), a riot shotgun becomes more compact and thus is able to be brought to bear more rapidly in very close quarters. With the stock, the pistol grip facilitates control of the weapon and provides a more ergonomic grip when the shotgun is fired from the shoulder. Foregrips, or forends, also vary, often with the inclusion of a pistol-grip fore-end (further increasing control and absorbing recoil), and/or the addition of an accessory rail or other mounting point for a tactical light.|$|E

2500|$|Initially {{the weapons}} issued were of WW2 vintage such as Lee–Enfield rifles and Sten sub machine guns. In early 1972 the rifles were {{replaced}} with the standard issue L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle (SLR). Other weaponry became available too: 9mm Browning pistols (Browning 9mm), the Sterling sub machine guns (SMG), the L4A4 Light Machine Guns (LMG) and L7A2 General Purpose Machine Gun (GPMG)s. Small stocks of Federal <b>Riot</b> <b>Guns</b> (FRG) were kept and used to fire plastic bullets to knock down doors and other obstacles during search operations. A number of Carl Gustav (Charlie G) 84mm recoilless rifles were stocked but rarely deployed as the weapon was unsuited to most operations. (see Boat Sections below). SLRs were replaced in 1988 by the SA80 {{and at the same}} time machine guns were superseded by the Light Support Weapon. [...] Metal caltrops were used at vehicle check points [...] to puncture tyres on cars trying to escape roadblocks.|$|E
2500|$|The primary {{characteristic}} of a riot shotgun is a [...] "short" [...] barrel (generally 14 to 20" [...] long; 18" [...] is the shortest length available in the U.S. that {{is not subject to}} additional federal BATFE regulation, though such restrictions are rarely a problem for police departments and thus shorter-barrel shotguns are not uncommon among police) which makes the shotgun more compact and easier to handle, easier to stow inside a police vehicle, and more suitable for quick aiming at (close) stationary targets. Generally they have an open (cylinder-bore) choke, to permit the shot to spread quickly and to allow use with other types of projectiles, and they may be equipped with bead, rifle, or ghost-ring sights. <b>Riot</b> <b>guns</b> are most often pump-action due to this design's lower cost and higher reliability, although in recent years a number of semi-automatic shotguns designed primarily for defensive use have become available and are used by military, law enforcement and civilians alike.|$|E
2500|$|Critics of taser use, however, {{argue that}} [...] "excited delirium" [...] {{is not a}} valid medical term and is not listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, {{although}} the term is actually recognized by the National Association of Medical Examiners and the American College of Emergency Physicians. Tasers are often used {{as an alternative to}} attempting to verbally get a potentially armed, or otherwise dangerous suspect to comply, striking the suspect with a baton or shooting them with firearms. The term [...] "less-lethal" [...] is being used more frequently when referring to weapons such as tasers because many experts feel that no device meant to subdue a person can be completely safe. [...] The less-lethal category also includes devices such as pepper spray, tear gas, <b>riot</b> <b>guns</b> and batons, all of which have been reported as contributing or causative factors in deaths. One problem when comparing the Taser to other forms of force is that no precise statistics are kept in the U.S. on policing related deaths or the use of excessive force. In 2001, the New York Times reported that the U.S. government is unable or unwilling to collect statistics showing the precise number of suspects killed by the police or the prevalence of the use of excessive force.|$|E

2500|$|Just a {{few weeks}} later, Pollock became deeply {{involved}} in the Hardin County onion pickers strike. [...] On June 19, 1934, onion weeders formed the first union of farm laborers in the United States, {{under the auspices of the}} International Quarrymen's Union. The 30 employers belong to the Onion Growers' Association, refused to recognize or bargain with the union, so the union called a strike. On June 22, a local court judge issued a sweeping labor injunction which restricted picketing in groups of two. Local sheriff's deputies began mass arrests of the picketers for congregating in violation of the injunction. The county sheriff, supplied with funds provided by the employers, hired Ohio National Guard troops who had recently served in Toledo during the Auto-Lite strike, and armed them with <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> machine-guns, and tear gas. Protests from Governor George White regarding the use of public equipment for private use were ignored. The troops helped break the strike by forcing workers off the picket lines, and arrests hundreds of workers. [...] When a truck full of replacement workers attempted to run down a group of picketers, the picketers retaliated by throwing stones. [...] Pollock was jailed, and a $1,000 bail set for this incident. Pollock was held incommunicado for several days. [...] When the local sheriff did tell Sarah Pollock where her husband was, he denied her access to him. When Pollock finally met with his defense attorneys, sheriff's deputies crowded close to listen in the conversations, and physically intimidate the lawyers. The strike ended shortly thereafter without agreement, and the union disbanded.|$|E
50|$|After his death, {{an investigative}} team {{looked through the}} home where Bouhouche lived, finding a Remington riot gun. Because the Nivelles gang also used <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> a {{ballistics}} test was performed (The gang used Winchester <b>riot</b> <b>guns,</b> which accept the same ammunition). Weapons experts concluded in June 2006 that the Remington riot gun was not used in the Nivelles gang attacks.|$|E

Typical operating scenarios include domestic violence intervention, marking violent suspects and building surveillance.|$|R
5000|$|During World War II Remington {{produced}} a Model 31 <b>riot</b> <b>gun</b> for military use. These were stamped [...] "U.S. Property" [...] {{on the left}} side of the receiver and had an approximate serial number range of 51000-63000.

50|$|The {{decline in}} {{military}} use of shotguns reversed in World War I. American forces under General Pershing employed 12-gauge pump action shotguns {{when they were}} deployed to the Western front in 1917. These shotguns were fitted with bayonets and a heat shield so the barrel could be gripped while the bayonet was deployed. Shotguns fitted in this fashion became known as trench guns by the United States Army. Those without such modifications were known as <b>riot</b> <b>guns.</b> After World War I, the United States military began referring to all shotguns as <b>riot</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
