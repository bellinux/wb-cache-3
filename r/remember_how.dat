5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in three parts. First, Anderson recorded the music for Ashen. This was done in a wooden loft {{in the corner of}} the rehearsal space used by Azrael, of whom Anderson was, at the time, a member. Anderson has said that he does not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> long this recording took him, as he slept there after finishing the work. He described that space as perfect for the recording, as there was nothing there to distract him.|$|E
5|$|I said, 'Mr. Malcolm, {{could you}} tell me {{something}} about your mother?' And I will never, ever forget how he stopped almost as if he was suspended like a marionette. And he said, 'I remember the kind of dresses she used to wear. They were old and faded and gray.' And then he walked some more. And he said, 'I <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> she was always bent over the stove, trying to stretch what little we had.' And that was the beginning, that night, of his walk. And he walked that floor until just about daybreak.|$|E
5|$|The {{relationship}} was often tense between the City and the Crown. The City of London {{had been a}} stronghold of republicanism during the Civil War (1642–1651), and the wealthy and economically dynamic capital still {{had the potential to}} be a threat to Charles II, as had been demonstrated by several republican uprisings in London in the early 1660s. The City magistrates were of the generation that had fought in the Civil War, and could <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Charles I's grab for absolute power had led to that national trauma.|$|E

What a tough track and tough conditions. We were really in our {{wheelhouse}} {{and we were just}} able to execute all day.” ...|$|R

5|$|As {{the season}} progresses, Elsa befriends series protagonist Emma Swan, Emma and the series' central cast resolving the help Elsa find Anna. The group {{eventually}} discovers that a figure named the Snow Queen (a more faithful {{adaptation of the}} original fairy tale's character) is somehow responsible for Elsa's trapping in her urn, a woman with similar powers to Elsa. They soon discover that the Snow Queen is Elsa's aunt, Ingrid, who was forgotten from Arendelle when Elsa's mother, Gerda, used {{the power of the}} troll king to erase everyones memory of her, not wishing for the world to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> Ingrid accidentally killed their third sister, Helga. Ingrid soon discovered a prophecy that stated she would one day have the love of her sisters again. With Ingrid's sisters dead however, she believed she would be forced to create new sisters. For this, she chose Emma and Elsa. Ingrid had stalked Emma her entire life in preparation for the prophecy to become true, and manipulated events in Arendelle to bring Elsa to her. Being convinced that she could only gain their love when {{she was the only one}} left, she obtained a mirror capable of bringing out the worst in people (the mirror coming directly from The Snow Queen fairy tale). If a piece of the mirror were to get in someones eye, they would see nothing but hatred in the world. Ingrid had planned to use this on everyone in Storybrooke (dubbed the Spell of Shattered Sight), forcing all of its citizens to kill each other while she, Emma, and Elsa remained immune. Ingrid had also used this to her advantage on Anna, forcing Anna to trap Elsa in the urn they originally found Elsa in.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to play {{situations}} {{like in the}} adjacent diagram - each time the pawn is moved forward, it must be without giving check. If the pawn checks the opponent's king, the opposition is lost and the game is drawn.|$|E
25|$|Memory underpins and enables social {{interactions}} {{in a variety}} of ways. In order to engage in successful social interaction, people must be able to <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> they should interact with one another, whom they have interacted with previously, and what occurred during those interactions.|$|E

25|$|A {{parallel}} {{phenomenon has}} appeared involving {{the increased use}} of input methods to write Chinese characters and the difficulty of remembering such a large set of characters. The use of word processors allows the user to write using characters that the user does not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to write by hand. This resulted in the reappearance in the 1980s in Japan of complex older characters which had been removed from the official lists. The number of characters available for use on a word processor far exceeds the number of characters a person can readily <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to write by hand. While many have blamed the use of input methods for difficulty remembering how to write the characters by hand, widespread use of input methods may be responsible for a reversal in the decline of kanji use in Japan.|$|E
25|$|But as Stewart tracks three post-plague generations, he vividly {{demonstrates}} that advanced civilisation depends on numbers. Reduce {{the race to}} the size of a small town and how many residents will <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to make plastic? The last Americans plunder canned goods (with little respect for sell-by dates), and literacy atrophies; electrical and water systems break down. At length, the community reverts to its hunter-gatherer forebears.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{finding in}} amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This {{reflects the fact}} that the MTL is a processor for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store these kind of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to perform relatively simple tasks immediately (on the order of 10 seconds), but when the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating procedural memory tasks from declarative memory; some elements of declarative memory may be used in learning procedural tasks.|$|E

25|$|Chinese {{characters}} are a logographic form of writing, where {{the form of}} the character is not always directly related to its pronunciation. The {{characters are}} composed of a combination of 8–11 standard strokes, over a hundred common radicals, and hundreds of phonetic components. The characters can be very complex and learning them is a highly neuro-muscular task, meaning {{that it is difficult to}} <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to write the characters without repetitive practice in writing them by hand. Scientific studies have also shown that while reading utilizes diverse areas of the brain, reading Chinese makes unique usage of distinct parts of the frontal and temporal areas of the brain associated with motor memory, areas associated with handwriting.|$|E
25|$|In January 1855 Wagner {{proceeded}} to compose the full score {{without bothering to}} write an intermediate instrumentation draft {{as he had done}} for Das Rheingold. This was a decision he was soon to regret, as numerous interruptions made the task of orchestrating the Gesamtentwurf an exceedingly difficult one. If he allowed too much time to elapse between the initial drafting of a passage and its later elaboration, he found that he could not <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> he had intended to orchestrate the draft. Consequently, some passages had to be composed again from scratch. Wagner, nevertheless, persevered with the task and the full score was finally completed on 20 March 1856. The fair copy was begun on 14 July 1855 in the Swiss resort of Seelisberg, where Wagner and his wife spent a month. It was completed in Zürich on 23 March 1856, just three days after the completion of the full score.|$|E
25|$|After {{the final}} element, Warmth, is {{restored}} in the volcano Mount Horu, Kuro captures Ori and Sein {{as the fire}} from Horu starts to spread. Naru, who had been separated from Gumo, arrives to find Ori unconscious and is heartbroken, which makes Kuro <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> she also {{was struck by the}} pain of losing her children. As the fire spreads and is about to reach her remaining egg, Kuro takes Sein back to the Spirit Tree, which emits a flash of bright light that dissipates the fire and restores the forest, but Kuro is destroyed by the light. Time passes as the forest begins to flourish once more, and Ori is shown sitting on a log watching new spirits being born in the field {{at the foot of the}} Spirit Tree. Gumo and Naru watch together from afar, before the latter goes home, where Kuro's egg now rests, just in time to see it hatch.|$|E

25|$|Walter Raleigh's 1595 {{journey with}} Antonio de Berrio had aimed to reach Lake Parime in the {{highlands}} of Guyana (the supposed location of El Dorado at the time). He was encouraged by the account of Juan Martinez, believed to be Juan Martin de Albujar, who had taken part in Pedro de Silva's expedition of the area in 1570, only {{to fall into the}} hands of the Caribs of the Lower Orinoco. Martinez claimed that he was taken to the golden city in blindfold, was entertained by the natives, and then left the city and couldn't <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> to return. Raleigh had set many goals for his expedition, and believed he had a genuine chance at finding the so-called city of gold. First, he wanted to find the mythical city of El Dorado, which he suspected to be an actual Indian city named Manõa. Second, he hoped to establish an English presence in the Southern Hemisphere that could compete with that of the Spanish. His third goal was to create an English settlement in the land called Guyana, and to try to reduce commerce between the natives and Spaniards.|$|E
25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} <b>remember</b> <b>how</b> an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that part of speech into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E

500|$|The {{inspiration}} for the lyrics comes {{from some of the}} people the group met in the music industry, and are about the presumptuous superstar life, and how someone can get trapped in the world of fame, much like the Temptations' 1971 classic [...] "Superstar (<b>Remember</b> <b>How</b> You Got Where You Are)".|$|E
