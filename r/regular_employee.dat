2500|$|The Convair 580 {{aircraft}} {{was en route}} from Oslo Airport, Fornebu, Norway to Hamburg Airport, West Germany. The passengers were employees of the shipping company Wilhelmsen Lines who were flying to Hamburg for the launching ceremony of a new ship. Half of the employees of the company's head office were on board. Leif Terje Løddesøl, an executive of Wilhelmsen, said that {{the atmosphere in the}} company was [...] "very very good" [...] prior to the accident flight. He said that some of the employees [...] "maybe" [...] had been to prior naming ceremonies, which he described as [...] "quite exciting." [...] A <b>regular</b> <b>employee</b> on the flight, one of the top-performing employees in the company, had been asked to give the speech during the launching ceremony. Løddesøl said that it was not often that a [...] "normal person" [...] in the company was chosen to read the speech at the naming ceremony.|$|E
6000|$|I {{might have}} been a {{fortnight}} in the shop, when I heard a voice as gentle and lady-like as that of Adrienne, inquiring for pocket-handkerchiefs. My heart fairly beat for joy; for, to own the truth, I was getting to be wearied to death with the garrulous folly of my companions. They had so much of the couturieres about them! not one of the whole party ever having been a <b>regular</b> <b>employee</b> in genteel life. Their niaisiries were endless, and there was just as much of the low bred anticipation as to their future purchases, as one sees at the balls of the Champs Elysee on the subject of partners. The word [...] "pocket-handkerchief," [...] and that so sweetly pronounced, drew open our drawer, as it might be, instinctively. Two or three dozen of us, all of exquisite fineness, were laid upon the counter, myself and two or three more of the better class being kept a little in the back ground, as a skillful general holds his best troops in reserve.|$|E

40|$|Nowadays both {{part-time}} {{as well as}} <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> {{are working}} in many organizations of Bangladesh. Though many {{studies have been conducted}} to know the motivation status of <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> but no study is found that addressed motivations status of both <b>regular</b> and part-time <b>employees</b> of Bangladesh. Thus, this study is conducted on 300 <b>regular</b> and part-time <b>employees</b> of Bangladesh to know the most motivating factors of both <b>regular</b> and part-time <b>employees.</b> Respondents were asked to identify and rank ten motivation factors in the order of their magnitude. The findings reveal that good salary, job security, good working condition and interesting work are the most important motivating factors for the <b>regular</b> <b>employees,</b> whereas; flexibility of work, interesting work, good salary and good work environment are the most important motivating factor for part-time employees, because most of the part-time employees working in different organizations are either students or <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> of other organizations. The findings of the study can be useful for managers and human resource (HR) professionals for motivating <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> as well as part-time employees and thereby achieving the goals of organization more effectively and efficiently...|$|R

Conducting manufacturing operations seven days a week solves the problem. A new algorithm is presented to determine the minimal number of workers necessary for the fluctuating demand. The minimal numbers of workers are compared between the two Labor Allocation Models, i. e., Modela: Only <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> are allocated, and Model b: Both <b>regular</b> and irregular <b>employees</b> are allocated.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has suggested that}} there is a strong and positive relationship between being an entrepreneur and possessing a high degree of subjective well-being as well as job satisfaction. The big five personality traits have also been argued to be significantly related to both subjective well-being and job satisfaction. Little is however known if personality affects entrepreneurs and <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> differently. In this paper the impact of personality traits on the cognitive part of subjective well-being as well as job satisfaction are investigated separately among entrepreneurs and <b>regular</b> <b>employees.</b> This is done through OLS-regressions using a Swedish nationally representative survey Employment, Material Resources, and Political Preferences (EMRAPP), where entrepreneurs were oversampled {{in order to be able}} to compare entrepreneurs (N = 2483) and <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> (N = 2642). The findings suggest that there is no substantial difference between entrepreneurs and <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> when looking at the relationship between personality traits and subjective well-being. Findings on job satisfaction on the other hand showed that the personality trait openness to experience had no impact on job satisfaction, and that the personality trait emotional stability (neuroticism reversed) was equally beneficial for both entrepreneurs and <b>regular</b> <b>employees.</b> Extraversion had a positive relationship with job satisfaction among both entrepreneurs and <b>regular</b> <b>employees,</b> although the relationship was twice as strong among entrepreneurs. The personality traits agreeableness and conscientiousness on the other hand were only related to job satisfaction among entrepreneurs. Personality traits are thus much more important for job satisfaction among entrepreneurs...|$|R

40|$|Using Japanese {{longitudinal}} {{data from the}} Keio Household Panel Survey 2004 - 2010, this paper focuses on those who work involuntarily as non-regular workers {{because they could not}} secure jobs as <b>regular</b> <b>employees.</b> Our findings are as follows: First, the majority of non-regular workers are categorized as voluntary although the number of involuntary non-regular workers is not negligible—about 1. 5 times more than that of the unemployed. Second, more involuntary non-regular workers are found among non-married workers, those in their 20 s or 40 - 50 s, contract and temporary agency workers, transport and machine-operation workers, or manufacturing process workers. Third, judging from the selection and transition behavior among labor force status, involuntary non-regular workers have more similarity with unemployed persons and less similarity with voluntary non-regular workers. Fourth, the measured mental health index indicates that the stress levels of non-regular workers, unemployed persons, and non-workers are higher than that of <b>regular</b> <b>employees.</b> After controlling for individual heterogeneity and endogeneity of the labor force status, however, only involuntary non-regular workers and unemployed persons show to have higher stress levels than <b>regular</b> <b>employees.</b> It is interpreted that involuntary non-regular workers as well as unemployed persons are worse off due to the demand-side constraints, and they are therefore likely to face mental health illness compared with <b>regular</b> <b>employees</b> or voluntary non-regular workers. ...|$|R
