40|$|Turkey {{has been}} in a long {{harmonization}} process with the EU since 1950 s, endeavoring for full membership by meeting the requirements set by the EU. The EU Regional Policy is among the most demanding policy in terms of its requirements, especially for a country like Turkey with high regional economic disparities. Since the regional disparities in Turkey are increasing and necessary financial assistance provided by the EU, the preference of Turkey to improve its economy at regional level is towards the EU. Thus, the analyses of both EU and Turkey in the <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> <b>area</b> are done in this work in detail. The classification of the regions under NUTS II categorization like in the EU and the establishment of the RDAs in Turkey are conspicuous reforms in institutional structure of the country. By providing consulting services and use of financial resources, the RDAs are functional bodies for the improvements made in the <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> <b>area.</b> Turkey had significant progress in converging its institutional and legislative structures but still there is a long to do list including the improvements on administrative capacity, labor force, financial controlling and monitoring mechanisms, and programming. If we take the İstanbul Development Agency (İSTKA) {{as an example of the}} RDAs in Turkey, the evolution of RDAs and their attempts should continue, pursuant to accession in the EU as to develop its regions economically. Considering the EU as the pattern of modernity, democracy and development, Turkey should maintain its reforms in line with the EU criteria to become a part of the EU in the near future...|$|E

The initial rural development push to rectify the colonial policy of benign neglect of the Malay, rural,peasant sector rested on the urban industrial growth models in neoclassical growth theory. Integrated rural development was the second approach, conceptually fuzzy and diffuse. Broader policy formulations followed anchored on multiple policy interventions approximately focused on rural poverty. In these policy formulations, the notions of geography, space, place and territory the Spatial dimensions- in rural development gradually emerged in the <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> <b>area</b> and growth poles approaches.

40|$|The {{development}} of <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> <b>area</b> didn’t go {{far from the}} regional autonomy principle application. In its basic principles, regional autonomy was media or way to answer basic problems of governmental arrangement and service to public. Regional autonomy should be way or effort to take the government closer to the people. Rule No. 32 / 2004 brought freshness to the residence / City {{to do their own}} government on the decentralization basic (autonomy) in wide, real and responsible way. Strengthen factors of Kubu Raya Residence developmental process were the wide or residence line, the amount of citizens, the service area of residence government where the people were difficult to access the service because of the imbalance regional development. If in a residence, there only a few sub-districts had easy way in economic or bureaucracy, while the other sub-districts, since they were far from the central residence, they were left and ignored the host. That’s why by look at the regional condition and the location which was far from residence, the nine sub-districts in Pontianak, they were Batu Ampar sub- districts, Terentang, Kubu, Teluk Pakedai, Sungai Kakap, Rasau Jaya, Sungai Raya, Sungai Ambawang, and Kuala Mandor B had initiative to develop their village named Kubu Raya Residence. In this research, the writer used qualitative method, the research was descriptive. While the location was Pontianak residence, by cinsideration that Pontianak residence was host residence and the place where the writer lived which would make the research easier. The subject researched were The chief of Kubu Raya residence, The chief of Pontianak Residence (host residence), the chief of government and social wellnes department, the chief of regional employee, the chief of organization and financial, the chief of general department, the chief of citizenship and education, the chief of farm and forestry residence, people and village forum institution Kubu Raya residence and the elders of Pontianak Residence. The result showed that Kubu Raya residence area development process had run well. As showed by the other development regions. The process happened in 2 years, started by the will of the society to develop their region into new residence, Kubu Raya residence which represented by chief of villages from 9 sub-districts, the elders of Pontianak residence who was Bapak Muda Mahendrawan and Village Forum Institution of Kubu Raya Residence. The people will to develop their region was based on will for a better services in health, education, and so on, since the other area was far from the residence. That’s why there held a Team of Kubu Raya Residence development which called team 9 as container to accomodate and make access easier in forming Kubu Raya Residence. Then begin a struggle to prove people aspiration to form Kubu Raya Residence which started by aspiration to Pontianak Residence Representative, Chief of Pontianak Residence, Government of West Kalimantan Province, Chief of Pontianak Residence, Regional Government of West-Kalimantan Province, Governor of West- Kalimantan Province, and Ministry of Internal Affairs. Supports flew from Pontianak Residence (Host Residence), including from the government of West-Kalimantan Province, the Province gave 5 billion rupiahs and Pontianak Residence (Host Residence) gave 10 billion fund. So for operational fund, there was 15 billion rupiahs. While the Chief of Kubu Raya Residence located in Graha Pramuka building which was province asset and the host residence also apply for the representative office borrowing to the Kubu Raya Residence. At last, in August 10 th 2007, Commission II Legislative legalized Rule No. 35 / 2007 No 101 and the additional paper No. 4751 about the form of Kubu Raya residence and the process Kubu Raya residence development ended. So that there could be concluded that the Kubu Raya residence development was aspiration from society of Batu Ampar sub-district, Terentang, Kubu, Teluk Pakedai, Sungai Kakap, Rasau Jaya, Sungai Raya, Sungai Ambawang, and Kuala Mandor B which wanted to develop their region into a better way, especially people service, whether in education, health, etc, since the region located far from residence center, since the access was not efficient. According to the residence could be seen that regional autonomy {{development of}} Kubu Raya residence needed to prepare various supporter’s toolslike government infrastructure facility, economic, social, human resource and financial, also the other supporting facilities needed by an autonomy region and increasing facility and infrastructure in land so that they could reach regions which still could not be accessed to make service to the society easier and focused their service to sub-district and villages around. So that the service given to the society would be faster since the time shorter and people would felt more satisfied in receiving service from the government...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to test the {{hypothesis}} that for rural regions of Switzerland, jobs and enterprises do not have a positive effect on the quality of <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> in rural <b>areas.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Population development is used as an indicator for the quality of <b>regional</b> <b>development.</b> Economic, infrastructural, demographic and topographic variables for Swiss rural districts are summarized by factor analysis. The birth and migration balances of these districts between 1990 and 2000 are explained by two regressions. Findings – Remoteness influences both the birth and the migration balance negatively. Jobs and enterprises in the districts, split by sector, definitely do not spur population development. Research limitations/implications – Research on <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> should not overestimate the importance of a flourishing economy. Practical implications – In <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> projects, infrastructural factors are of central importance. Originality/value – The influence of economic factors in <b>regional</b> <b>development</b> is explicitly compared with non-economic factors.

The 2011 Australian Census of Population and Housing is analysed, showing great diversity between regions around national trends. The level of contemporary population growth and the relative contribution of natural increase, international and internal migration and ageing to these trends highlight the diversity across regions. This report shows that non-metropolitan regions are not static, homogenous and declining but are in fact diverse, dynamic and heterogeneous. Key trends have emerged for coastal, inland and metropolitan areas experiencing different rates and types of population growth and decline. Graeme Hugo, Helen Feist, George Tan and Kevin Harri...|$|R
