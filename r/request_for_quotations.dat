Woods summarises the cancellation of the SR.177 as: [...] "...it could ultimately have been built in hundreds or thousands. Due to ridiculous defence policies and a complete lack of Whitehall inter-departmental collaboration in the technology field, one of the most promising projects in a decade was destroyed".|$|E

40|$|Participation {{of small}} {{businesses}} {{in the market for}} public contracts is widely recognized as a key policy issue. It is also commonly held that the adoption of e-procurement solutions can be effective in pursuing such an objective. To this end, we analyze the transactions completed in the period 2004 - 2007 through the Italian Governmentâ€™s e-procurement platform, that is, the marketplace managed by the Italian Public Procurement Agency (Consip S. p. A.). Although descriptive statistics indicate that micro suppliers are the most represented group of firms in the marketplace, our econometric treatment provides some evidence that the former are less successful than all other suppliers in getting public contracts. Degree of loyalty with buyers, location and the use of other MEPA negotiation tools, also emerge as relevant factors of success in the e-procurement market.

40|$|Engaging in {{corporate}} social responsibility has become increasingly important for organisations. This has increased the focus on sourcing processes and how social and environmental aspects can be incorporated. Organisations are now taking action {{in an attempt to}} trace their use of so called conflict minerals, and to assure that their supply chain is free from them. The purpose of this thesis is to investigate how automotive manufacturers can source components potentially containing conflict minerals in a socially responsible way. This is done through a case study at an automotive manufacturer not yet affected by any regulation. The study highlights that incorporating requirements and policies into codes of conducts and/or <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotations,</b> traceability and collaborative measures such as sharing of information are crucial to ensure a supply chain free from conflict minerals, whereas supply chain complexity and the lack of monitoring activities constitutes barriers.

40|$|The {{outsourcing}} {{of products}} and services is a growing trend globally. In the electronics industry, original equipment manufacturers are increasingly focusing on high-value design and marketing aspects of their business, while outsourcing the manufacture of their products to contract manufacturers. Due to this increase in outsourcing, there {{is an increase in}} the number of <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotations</b> being issued by companies to potential suppliers. These quotations can be difficult to cost as they can contain operational details. This paper presents the reader with requirements for a tool to aid outsourcing enterprises in the costing of contracts. As part of the requirements gathering phase, a conceptual design was carried out and an initial prototype developed as a means for validating the interpretation of the requirements and for eliciting new requirements for the tool, and this is also presented.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis investigates {{what kind}} of battery system that is suitable for an electric driveline equipped with a mechanical fly wheel, focusing on a battery with high specific energy capacity. Basic battery theory such as the principle of an electrochemical cell, limitations and C-rate is explained {{as well as the}} different major battery systems that are available. Primary and secondary cells are discussed, including the major secondary chemistries such as lead acid, nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium ion (Li-ion). The different types of Li-ion chemistries are investigated, explained and compared against each other as well as other battery technologies. The need for more complex protection circuitry for Li-ion batteries is included in the comparison. <b>Request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotations</b> are made to battery system manufacturers and evaluated. The result of the research is that the Li-ion NMC energy cell is the best alternative, even if the cost per cell is the most expensive compared to other major technologies. Due to the budget, the LiFeMnPO 4 chemistry is used in the realisation of the final system, which is scaled down with consideration to the power requirement...|$|E
40|$|The {{primary goal}} of this project is the {{engineering}} development of two advanced physical fine coal cleaning processes, column flotation and selective agglomeration, for premium fuel applications. The project scope includes laboratory research and bench-scale testing on six coals to optimize these processes, followed by design, and construction of a 2 -t/hr process development unit (PDU). The PDU will then be operated to generate 200 ton lots of each of three project coals, by each process. The project began in October, 1992 and is scheduled for completion by March, 1997. During Quarter 9 (October [...] December, 1995), parametric and optimization testing was completed for the Taggart, Sunnyside, and Indiana VII coal using a 12 -inch Microcel{trademark} flotation column. The detailed design of the 2 -t/hr PDU grinding, flotation, and dewatering circuits neared completion with the specification of the major pieces of capital equipment to be purchased for these areas. Selective agglomeration test work investigated the properties of various industrial grades of heptane for use during bench- and PDU-scale testing. It was decided to use a hydrotreated grade of commercial heptane due to its low cost and low concentration of aromatic compounds. The final Subtask 6. 4 CWF Formulation Studies Test Plan was issued. A draft version of the Subtask 6. 5 Preliminary Design and Test Plan Report was also issued, discussing the progress made {{in the design of}} the bench-scale selective agglomeration unit. PDU construction work moved forward through the issuing of 26 <b>request</b> <b>for</b> <b>quotations</b> and 21 award packages for capital equipment...|$|E
