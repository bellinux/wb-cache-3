Accurate reproducing of the propagation and deposition of debris flow is essential for mitigating these disasters. Through applying FLO- 2 D model to these debris flows and comparing the results with field observations, we seek to evaluate {{the performance of the}} model and to analyse the rheological model parameters. <b>Representative</b> <b>yield</b> stress and dynamic viscosity back-calculated for the debris flows in the northern side of Mt.

Numerical results obtained using these parameters reveal that deposition areas of debris flows in Raemian and Shindong-A regions are well reproduced in 63 – 85 % agreement with the field observations. However, the propagation velocities of the flows are significantly underestimated, which is attributable to the inherent limitations of the model that can’t take the entrainment of bed material and surface water into account. The debris flow deposition computed in Hyeongchon region where the entrainment is not significant appears to be in very good agreement with the field observation. The sensitivity study of the numerical results on model parameters shows that both sediment volume concentration and roughness coefficient significantly affect the flow thickness and velocity, which underscores the importance of careful selection of thes...|$|R

However these disputes were not based on suspicions of heterogeneity, but rather on the descriptions and nomenclatural acts associated with the species name. Large numbers of DNA barcode sequences of the cytochrome oxidase I obtained for nominal L. terrestris and six congeneric species reveal that there are two distinct lineages within nominal L. terrestris. One of those lineages contains the Swedish population from which the name-bearing specimen of L. terrestris was obtained. The other contains the population from which the syntype series of Enterion herculeum Savigny, 1826 was collected.

40|$|Particle impacts are of {{fundamental}} importance {{in many areas}} {{and there has been}} a renewed interest in research on particle impact problems. A comprehensive investigation of the particle impact problems, using finite element (FE) methods, is presented in this thesis. The capability of FE procedures for modelling particle impacts is demonstrated by excellent agreements between FE analysis results and previous theoretical, experimental and numerical results. For normal impacts of elastic particles, it is found that the energy loss due to stress wave propagation is negligible if it can reflect more than three times during the impact, for which Hertz theory provides a good prediction of impact behaviour provided that the contact deformation is sufficiently small. For normal impact of plastic particles, the energy loss due to stress wave propagation is also generally negligible so that the energy loss is mainly due to plastic deformation. Finite-deformation plastic impact is addressed in this thesis so that plastic impacts can be categorised into elastic-plastic impact and finite-deformation plastic impact. Criteria for the onset of finite-deformation plastic impacts are proposed in terms of impact velocity and material properties. It is found that the coefficient of restitution depends mainly upon the ratio of impact velocity to yield Vni/Vy 0 for elastic-plastic impacts, but it is proportional to [(Vni/Vy 0) *(Y/E*) ]- 1 / 2, where Y /E* is the <b>representative</b> <b>yield</b> strain for finite-deformation plastic impacts.

MOB subgroups have different responses to key environmental controls, reflecting on their functional traits. Their unique features (C 1 -metabolism, unique lipids and congruence between the 16 S rRNA and pmoA gene phylogeny) have facilitated numerous environmental studies, which in combination with the availability of cultured <b>representatives,</b> <b>yield</b> the most comprehensive ecological picture of any known microbial functional guild. Here, we focus on the broad MOB subgroups (type I and type II MOB), and aim to conceptualize MOB functional traits and observational characteristics derived primarily from these environmental studies to be interpreted as microbial life strategies. We focus on the functional traits, and the conditions under which these traits will render different MOB subgroups a selective advantage. We hypothesize that type I and type II MOB generally have distinct life strategies, enabling them to predominate under different conditions and maintain functionality. The ecological characteristics implicated in their adopted life strategies are discussed, and incorporated into the Competitor-Stress tolerator-Ruderal functional classification framework as put forward for plant communities. In this context, type I MOB can broadly be classified as competitor-ruderal while type II MOB fit more within the stress tolerator categories. Finally, we provide an outlook on MOB applications by exemplifying two approaches where their inferred life strategies could be exploited thereby, putting MOB into the context of microbial resource management...|$|R

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{application}} of Markov Chain theory for rice yield forecasting. Yield forecasts {{are based on the}} eco-physiological process of rice growth given measurable rice crop characteristics and weather data at intermediate times in the growing season of the rice crop. The ORYZA 1 model is used to simulate a database containing rice yields and rice crop conditions at specified times during the growing season. The model was ran on 32 years of historical weather data (1959 - 1990) from the meteorological station at the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI), Los Baños(121 15 E Latitude: 14 11 N Altitude: 21. 0 m), Laguna, Philippines. As input to the model, the study adopted the parameters on one of the <b>representative</b> <b>yield</b> potential field experiments at IRRI during the 1992 dry season for the IR 72 variety planted on a 15 x 15 m 2 plot. Based on the output of ORYZA 1, a Markov Chain (matrix of transition probabilities) was constructed to provide forecast distributions of rice yield for various rice condition classes at different rice phenological stages prior to harvest. This Markov Chain can provide several statistics of interests. This ranges from mean, percentile (median) and standard error of the forecasts to probability interval forecasts and predicted probabilities of exceeding (or falling bellow) target yields. The simulated rice yield obtained from ORYZA 1 model for 32 years ranged from 8. 33 to 10. 88 ton ha- 1 with an average of 9. 57 ton ha- 1 and a standard deviation of 0. 60 ton ha- 1. Forecasted yields from the matrix of transition probabilities ranged from 8. 58 to 9. 45 ton ha- 1 and standard deviations ranging from 0. 39 to 0. 60 ton ha- 1.

Indeed, for the two-by-two case, we show that the EJD of the <b>representative</b> matrices <b>yields</b> the optimal AJD solution. For larger-scale cases, the EJD can provide a suboptimal AJD solution, possibly serving as a good initial guess for a subsequent iterative algorithm.

Measurement of soil productivity in terms of yield differences has been hampered by the influence of management.

Milking-time tests represent the most direct method to validate the system vacuum of a milking machine, both the aptitude of vacuum production and the vacuum regulation throughout the system. The vacuum was measured at five points along the milking machine in a milking parlour for six consecutive days, both during morning and evening milking. Three points were measured continuously during the whole milking session, the receiver and two points on the milkline, while the claw and the mouthpiece chamber vacuum (MPCV) was measured during the milking of six cows on each milking occasion. Data was collected at a frequency of 100 Hz and the possibility of obtaining equally reliable results of the milking-time tests with a lower sampling frequency of 10 Hz and 1 Hz was tested in the data analysis by using subsamples of the complete dataset. The sampling frequency of 10 Hz compared to the 100 Hz frequency gave reliable results for means of the claw vacuum and MPCV while the frequency of 1 Hz did not.
