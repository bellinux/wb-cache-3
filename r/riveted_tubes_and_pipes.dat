50|$|In 1886, the German {{brothers}} Reinhard (1856-1922) and Max Mannesmann (1857-1915) {{received the}} world's first patent for their invention {{of a process}} for rolling seamless steel pipes (Mannesmann process). Between 1887 and 1889 they founded tube mills with several different business partners in Bous, Germany, in Komotau/Bohemia, in Landore/Wales and in their home town Remscheid/Germany. In 1890, due to technical and financial start-up problems, the <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> mills existing on the continent were folded into Deutsch-Österreichische Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG. The new company had its headquarters in Berlin. Reinhard and Max Mannesmann formed the first board of directors but left it in 1893. In that year the company headquarters were moved to Düsseldorf - {{at that time the}} center of the German <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> industry. The company was renamed Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG in 1908.|$|R
25|$|Bone flutes, mostly {{made from}} birds, are known since the Stone Age. Wooden flutes were {{introduced}} later and {{corresponded to the}} Roman fistula (shepherd's flute). But terracotta and bone whistles remained in use throughout antiquity. In addition woodwinds made of <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes,</b> similar to the Greek syrinx (pan flute), were in use.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> for {{hydraulic}} {{applications are}} internally oiled before {{the system is}} commissioned. Usually steel piping is painted outside. Where flare and other couplings are used, the paint is removed under the nut, and is a location where corrosion can begin. For this reason, in marine applications most piping is stainless steel.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, {{round stock}} {{is what is}} used in tube bending. However, square <b>and</b> {{rectangular}} <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> may also be bent to meet job specifications. Other factors involved in the tube bending process is the wall thickness, tooling and lubricants needed by the <b>pipe</b> <b>and</b> <b>tube</b> bender to best shape the material {{and it is also}} used in different ways e.g.( [...] tube,pipe wires).|$|R
50|$|A soft, {{ductile metal}} with low {{hardness}} and excellent corrosion resistance. Copper is used commonly in <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> for its inertness {{and resistance to}} corrosion. Copper {{can be used for}} low air, oxygen and other inert non-critical gases such as medical CFOS systems. For ultra pure gasses 316L Stainless steel remains the optimum choice for many reasons.|$|R
50|$|The name Mannesmann {{ceased to}} exist in the engineering, {{automotive}} and telecommunications sectors soon after Vodafone purchased the company. It lives on in the steel industry, particularly in the steel <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> industry, as the German steel manufacturer Salzgitter AG bought the pipe production division of Mannesmannröhren-Werke AG (today Mannesmannröhren-Werke GmbH), as well as the Mannesmann brand.|$|R
50|$|ABP Induction Systems is {{a global}} {{industrial}} firm that develops and integrates induction-related equipment and services for foundries, forges, <b>tube</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> producers, general manufacturers using heating equipment and manufacturers of micro electronics.

50|$|Products {{using this}} {{technology}} directly are automotive seatbelt springs, large power transformer winding strips, rotogravure plates, cable and hose clamps, gas tank straps, and window counterbalance springs. Products using the process indirectly are <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipe</b> mills where {{the edge of}} the strip is accurately beveled prior to being folded into tubular form and seam welded. The finished edges enable pinhole free welds.|$|R
50|$|As a {{malleable}} filling {{to prevent}} <b>tubes</b> <b>and</b> <b>pipes</b> from crimping when bent. Rose's metal is melted and {{poured into the}} tube. It then solidifies in place but remains malleable. This allows the tube or pipe to be bent and reworked without crimping. After the desired shape is achieved the Rose's metal is remelted and removed, leaving the pipe or tube in its modified shape.|$|R
