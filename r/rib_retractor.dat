30|$|From our {{experience}} in the two cases reported above, two points are noteworthy: Firstly, continuous PECS II block may {{have the potential to}} control postoperative pain in patients undergoing TA-TAVI. Secondly, the insertion of the catheter after the implantation could be a useful option to avoid its displacement due to the  distortion of the adjacent structures by the <b>rib</b> <b>retractor.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{necessity}} for prehospital thoracotomy is rare, {{but can be}} lifesaving. Occasionally an emergency practitioner or surgeon coincidentally arrives at a trauma scene {{before the arrival of}} emergency medical teams. In such a circumstance, even when thoracotomy may be indicated, it is not usually performed in view of the lack of equipment (e. g. dissecting tools or <b>rib</b> <b>retractor).</b> We present a novel technique of »L« shape thoracotomy, or Thoraco-sterno-costochondrotomy, whereby in a prehospital setting, and with minimal equipment (such as a penknife) a thoracotomy can be performed with adequate exposure of the heart and great vessels. The similarities of this pragmatic procedure are considered within the context of ancient Aztec and Mesoamerican thoracotomies...|$|E
50|$|Jan Mikulicz-Radecki's {{invention}} of a hinged <b>rib</b> spreading <b>retractor</b> in 1904 prompted {{a flurry of}} development of retractors in the early 20th century, culminating in 1936 in our modern device based {{on the design of}} Enrique Finochietto.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of transcatheter aortic valve implantations, structural heart procedures {{and the newly}} developed transcatheter mitral valve repair and replacement are traditionally performed either through a transfemoral or a transapical access site, depending {{on the presence of}} severe peripheral vascular disease or anatomic limitations. The transapical approach, which carries specific advantages related to its antegrade nature and the short distance between the introduction site and the cardiac target, is traditionally performed through a left anterolateral mini-thoracotomy and requires <b>rib</b> <b>retractors,</b> soft tissue retractors and reinforced apical sutures to secure, at first, the left ventricular apex for the introduction of the stent-valve delivery systems and then to seal the access site {{at the end of the}} procedure. However, despite the advent of low-profile apical sheaths and newly designed delivery systems, the apical approach represents a challenge for the surgeon, as it has the risk of apical tear, life-threatening apical bleeding, myocardial damage, coronary damage and infections. Last but not least, the use of large-calibre stent-valve delivery systems and devices through standard mini-thoracotomies compromises any attempt to perform transapical transcatheter structural heart procedures entirely percutaneously, as happens with the transfemoral access site, or via a thoracoscopic or a miniaturised video-assisted percutaneous technique. During the past few years, prototypes of apical access and closure devices for transapical heart valve procedures have been developed and tested to make this standardised successful procedure easier. Some of them represent an important step towards the development of truly percutaneous transcatheter transapical heart valve procedures in the clinical setting...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Thoracic Surgery has {{witnessed}} a massive {{revolution in the}} last 25 years with the standardization of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery as the best approach of the thoracic operations. Earlier, when thoracic surgery was done through the huge thoracotomy incisions and <b>rib</b> spreading <b>retractors</b> with their excruciating pain, the chest tube pain was masked, but using VATS, has caused surgeons seeking early removal of chest tubes. With advances of the instruments and stapling devices, the amount of air-leak was significantly reduced, diminishing the time needed for chest tube drainage. Methods: A prospective study, from May 2014 to December 2016, included 29 patients admitted to the service in Faculty of Medicine, Assiut University. Patients had different clinical presentations. Undergoing VATS procedures (uni-portal VATS in all except one), they were then divided into two groups: study group, those with intra-operative removal of chest tube, (16 patients) and control group (13 patients). Patients would undergo an air-leak test. Results: The two groups had {{a significant difference in}} the post-operative mean pain score (study group 4. 9 & control group 7. 8), and hospital stay (study group 1. 4 & control group 4). Both groups were similar in occurrence of post-operative pneumothorax (study group 25 % & control group 23. 1 %), with only 2 patients (12. 5 %) in the study group requiring re-insertion of chest tube. Conclusions: Intra-operative removal of chest tube during VATS procedures was a safe technique in well selected patients with an intra-operative successful air-leak test with radiological and clinical follow-up. This technique provided lesser post-operative pain with shorter hospital stay...|$|R
30|$|This method {{might be}} promising, {{because at least}} the {{high-quality}} analgesia and hemodynamic stability was observed during the operation in both the patients although in the first case, the severe postoperative pain led us to find the displacement of the catheter tip. While {{there is a possibility}} that the tip of catheter was displaced by postoperative patient’s movement or position change after the operation, we speculate that this was caused due to the distortion of the structures near the catheter by the <b>rib</b> <b>retractor</b> during thoracotomy. Therefore, in the second case, the catheterization for continuous PECS II block was performed after implantation of the valve to avoid the possible migration of the catheter tip due to distortion of the tissues. A postoperative ultrasound examination revealed that the position of the catheter tip had not changed, and high-quality pain control was maintained, not only intraoperatively, but also postoperatively. Even if a catheter should be inserted after the implantation, it might happen to migrate. Therefore, it is still important to check the position of the catheter tip by ultrasound examination in patients when continuous PECS II could not provide sufficient analgesia [15].|$|E
