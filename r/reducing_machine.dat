Our results prove that exact state minimization is feasible {{for a large}} class of practical examples, certainly including most hand-designed FSM’s. We also present heuristic algorithms, that can handle large, machine-generated, FSM’s. The possibly many different <b>reduced</b> <b>machines</b> with {{the same number of}} states have different implementation costs. We discuss two steps of the minimization procedure, called state mapping and solution shrinking, that have received little prior attention in the literature, though they {{play a significant role in}} delivering an optimally implemented <b>reduced</b> <b>machine.</b> We also introduce an algorithm whose main virtue is the ability to cope with very general cost functions, while providing high performance.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} interplay of {{optimization}} and machine learning. Great {{progress has been made}} in machine learning by cleverly <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> learning problems to convex optimization problems with one or more hyper-parameters. The availability of powerful convexprogramming theory and algorithms has enabled a flood of new research in machine learning models and methods. But many of the steps necessary for successful machine learning models fall outside of the convex machine learning paradigm. Thus we now propose framing machine learning problems as Stackelberg games. The resulting bilevel optimization problem allows for efficient systematic search of large numbers of hyper-parameters. We discuss recent progress in solving these bilevel problems and the many interesting optimization challenges that remain. Finally, we investigate the intriguing possibility of novel machine learning models enabled by bilevel programming. ...|$|E

40|$|Fab {{operations}} management strives to decrease cycle-time (CT) for driving low inventory, improved qual-ity, short time-to-market and lower cost. This work studies {{factors contributing to}} production variability, and evaluates the variability's influence on CT. It relies on queueing networks, CT and variability approx-imations, operational curve modeling, and common practice. It demonstrates that increasing variability drives longer CT at a growing pace, and has a larger effect on CT than utilization. Growing machine in-ventory weakens the impact of utilization on CT and almost eliminates it at high inventory, while the im-pact of variability on CT remains significant. Decline of machine availability prolongs CT at a growing pace, and is affected by variability more than utilization. Overall the primary factor of production varia-bility is attributed to machine availability, and specifically to repair time. Reducing variability for achiev-ing decreased CT is less costly and more effective than <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> utilization or increasing capaci-ty. ...|$|E

40|$|A central {{problem of}} tool {{management}} in Versatile Multi-tool machining centres {{is to decide}} how to batch the parts to be produced and what tools to allocate to the machine in order to maximize utilization of these expensive machines. Various authors have proposed heuristics and/or mathematical models to minimize the batches of parts to be manufactured in a production period. There is no comprehensive study reported to compare the number of actual batches (stoppages) formed with and without processing time considerations. In this paper, the sequential deterministic heuristics (SDHs) are appropriately adapted to include processing time of operations in the formation of groups. The modified heuristics are more realistic in <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> stoppages due to tools. Some stochastic search techniques have also been adapted to compute the number of groups.

30|$|Since DCMS and PP {{decisions}} are interrelated {{and may not}} be handled sequentially (Safaei and Tavakkoli-Moghaddam 2009; Defersha and Chen 2008 b), some of the PP attributes such as inventories holding and outsourcing of parts are incorporated to the extended model. The effects of incorporated design features on improving the performance of a DCMS have been also illustrated by (Kia 2014). For example, regarding the number of formed cells as decision variable can considerably improve the performance of a CMS by reducing forming cell cost. Furthermore, machine depot can be effective in improving the performance of a DCMS by <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> overhead cost and configuring cells more usefully because of removing idle machines from cells. Additionally, production planning decisions have been shown as improving strategies by satisfying high-volume demands because of leveling machine utilization in different periods. It is worth mentioning, because of the dynamic nature of PP problems, the integration of the CMS and PP makes the problem very complex and computationally hard.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} limitation {{to machine}} tool productivity in high-speed operations {{is due to}} inertial vibrations. During strong accelerations, inertial forces generate oscillations that are translated into surface geometrical errors on the machined parts. Machine tools users minimize these problems by <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> axes quickness, thus affecting productivity. In this paper the effects of inertial deformations on machine tool accuracy have been studied to evaluate the possibility of adopting a software compensation strategy. The proposed model-based solution, based on a reduced model of the machine tool dynamics, has been tested in a mechatronic simulation environment. In order to meet industrial needs, the compensation scheme {{has been designed to}} allow its implementation on standard numerical controllers. A detailed feasibility analysis has been carried out studying all aspects that can potentially impede the application of such approach.

40|$|The {{evolution}} in precision manufacturing {{has resulted in}} the requirement to produce and maintain more accurate machine tools. This new requirement coupled with desire to <b>reduce</b> <b>machine</b> tool downtime places emphasis on the calibration procedure during which the machine's capabilities are assessed. Machine tool downtime is significant for manufacturers because the machine will be unavailable for manufacturing use, therefore wasting the manufacturer's time and potentially increasing lead-times for clients. In addition to machine tool downtime, the uncertainty of measurement, due to the schedule of the calibration plan, has significant implications on tolerance conformance, resulting in an increased possibility of false acceptance and rejection of machined parts. The work presented in this paper is focussed on expanding a developed temporal optimisation model to reduce the uncertainty of measurement. Encoding the knowledge in regular PDDL requires the discretization of non-linear, continuous temperature change and implementing the square root function.

40|$|The {{fields of}} machine {{learning}} and mathematical programming are increasingly intertwined. Optimization problems {{lie at the}} heart of most machine learning approaches. The Special Topic on Machine Learning and Large Scale Optimization examines this interplay. Machine learning researchers have embraced the advances in mathematical programming allowing new types of models to be pursued. The special topic includes models using quadratic, linear, second-order cone, semidefinite, and semi-infinite programs. We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems. <b>Reducing</b> <b>machine</b> learning problems to well-explored mathematical programming classes with robust general purpose optimization codes allows machine learning researchers to rapidly develop new techniques...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Grid {{computing}} {{plays an}} important role in solving large-scale computational problems in a high performance computing environment. Scheduling of tasks to efficient and best suitable resource is one of the most challenging phase in grid computing systems. Grid environment reveals several challenges in efficient scheduling of complex applications because of its heterogeneity, dynamic behavior and shared resources. Scheduling of independent tasks in grid computing is dealt by a number of heuristic algorithms. This study proposes a new heuristic algorithm for mapping independent tasks in a grid environment to be assigned optimally among the available machines in a grid computing system. Due to the multi-objective nature of the grid scheduling problem, several performance measures and optimization criteria can be assumed to determine the quality of a given schedule. The metrics used here include makespan and resource utilization. This algorithm provides effective resource utilization by <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> idle time and minimizes makespan. This algorithm also balances load among the grid resources and produce high resource utilization with low computational complexity. The proposed algorithm is compared with other popular heuristics for performance measures...|$|E
40|$|Great {{progress}} has been made in machine learning by cleverly <b>reducing</b> <b>machine</b> learning problems to convex optimization problems with one or more hyper-parameters. But the convexity of the learning problem is dependent on defining the learning task very narrowly. Many practical aspects of learning tasks, such as data scaling, model selection, feature selection, dealing with missing values, and kernel selection, typically fall outside of the convex programming paradigm. To more fully incorporate the learning task into the optimization problem, we propose framing the learning problem as a Stackelberg game. The resulting bilevel optimization problems allow for efficient systematic search of large numbers of hyper-parameters. The upper level problem seeks to optimize generalization error by manipulating the hyper-parameters. The lower level problems optimize the model weights with the hyper-parameters fixed and return the models to the upper level problem for evaluation. Consider the prototypical problem of training support vector machines with hyperparameters using cross validation to select the hyper-parameters. While cross validation is a commonly employed and widely accepted method for selecting these parameters, it...|$|E

With the advancement of internet technologies, customer services nowadays are supported through web-based systems. More recently, rapid development of the semantic web and semantic web services has prompted us to develop a semantic help-desk for supporting customer services over the semantic web environment, which is presented in this paper. In particular, a fuzzy formal concept analysis (FCA) -based approach is developed for automatic generation of fuzzy machine service ontology that can deal with uncertain information. The proposed automatic fuzzy ontology generation technique consists of the following steps: fuzzy formal concept analysis, fuzzy conceptual clustering, and ontology generation.

40|$|Minimal valid automata (MVA) {{refer to}} valid automata models that fit a given {{input-output}} sequence sample from a Mealy machine model. They are minimal {{in the sense}} that the number of states in these automata is minimal. Critical to system identification problems of discrete event systems, MVA can be considered as a special case of the minimization problem for incom-pletely specified sequential machine (ISSM). While the minimization of ISSM in general is an NP-complete problem, various approaches have been proposed to alleviate computational requirement by taking special structural properties of the ISSM at hand. In essence, MVA is to find the minimal re-alization of an ISSM where each state only has one subsequent state transi-tion defined.
