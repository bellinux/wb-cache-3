Eight half-sib families with a total of 317 Angora kids, 40 kids with unknown sires and an additional 16 putative sires were included in the study. 14. 3 % of the on-farm pedigrees were amended, including incorrect (according to the DNA verification) or incomplete records. Estimated breeding values (EBV) for fleece traits (fibre diameter and fleece weight) as well as body weights (birth weight and weaning weight) were calculated for 21 sires using ASREML, firstly for the breederâ€™s <b>recorded</b> <b>pedigree</b> and secondly for the DNA-verified pedigree. An overall greater effect was observed in body weight traits than in fleece weight traits with regard to sire EBVs and the ranking thereof.

5000|$|Sometimes {{the word}} {{purebred}} is used synonymously with pedigreed, but purebred {{refers to the}} animal having a known ancestry, and pedigree refers to the written record of breeding. Not all purebred animals have their lineage in written form. For example, until the 20th century, the Bedouin people of the Arabian peninsula only recorded the ancestry of their Arabian horses via an oral tradition, supported by the swearing of religiously based oaths as to the asil or [...] "pure" [...] breeding of the animal. Conversely, some animals may have a <b>recorded</b> <b>pedigree</b> or even a registry, but not be considered [...] "purebred". Today the modern Anglo-Arabian horse, a cross of Thoroughbred and Arabian bloodlines, is considered such a case.|$|R

The Kenya Boran cattle breedersâ€™ society (KBCBS) is {{actively involved in the}} improvement of the breed. Due to their superior adaptive and productive traits in comparison to other indigenous breeds of cattle, they have also become a popular choice for breeders in Eastern and Southern Africa. Their continued genetic improvement through progeny and performance testing is critical and accurate <b>pedigree</b> <b>records</b> are paramount. <b>Pedigree</b> <b>records</b> of four stud herds were evaluated for accuracy using 11 microsatellite markers on 178 samples. The microsatellite markers had a combined probability of exclusion (CPE) of 0. 9997. The dam misidentification rate was 0 to 5 % and that of the sires ranged from 4. 3 to 80 % between the four stud herds. 4, 456 Boran <b>pedigree</b> <b>records</b> from Kenya stud book for the four participating stud herds were analysed for inbreeding. The average generation interval was 6. 8 years and the estimated inbreeding coefficient was unexpectedly low (0. 0023), probably due to incomplete records. The high rate of mispaternity will lead to low response to selection and increased inbreeding. The use of DNA markers for parentage assignment will improve the accuracy of the <b>pedigree</b> <b>records.</b> This will enhance the accuracy of selection, increase the rate of genetic gain and improve effective monitoring of inbreeding.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to document the influence of Line 1 Hereford cattle, developed by the United States Department of Agriculture at its research facility in Miles City, Montana, on Hereford cattle in South Africa. Analytical approaches made use of both <b>recorded</b> <b>pedigree</b> and microsatellite marker information. Cattle with recorded performance data in South Africa were mated with Line 1 Hereford sires in silico and inbreeding coefficients were calculated for the resulting progeny. The relationship between South African and Line 1 Hereford cattle populations was estimated as twice the maximum inbreeding coefficient for the progeny of each South African animal. The calculated pedigree relationship of Hereford cattle registered in South Africa with Line 1 was 24 %. Thirty-six South African Hereford cattle and a sample of 64 Line 1 animals were genotyped with 34 microsatellite markers. Based on a Bayesian model-based clustering method, the probability that the South African Hereford cattle were members of Line 1 was 0. 38 Â± 0. 08.

40|$|Reliability of {{predictions}} from single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) can {{be calculated}} by inversion, {{but that is not}} feasible for large data sets. Two proposed approximations of reliability are based on decomposition of a function of reliability into contributions from <b>records,</b> <b>pedigree,</b> and genotypes. The first approximation involves inversion of a matrix that contains inverses of the genomic relationship matrix (G) and the pedigree relationship matrix for genotyped animals (A 22). The second approximation involves only the diagonal elements of those inverses. The approximations were tested with a simulated data set. The correlations between exact and approximated contributions due to genomic information were 0. 92 for the first approximation and 0. 56 for the second approximation; contributions were inflated 60 and 260 %, respectively. The respective correlations for reliabilities were 0. 98 and 0. 72. After correction for inflation, those correlations increased to 0. 99 and 0. 89. Approximations of reliabilities of predictions by ssGBLUP are accurate and computationally feasible.
