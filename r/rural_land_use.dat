40|$|The {{physical}} {{appearance of the}} Netherlands is rapidly changing. The land of prosperous towns and villages embedded in rich, flat and open agricultural land is turning into a metropolis. A distinctive quality of this metropolis is the mix of highly urbanized centres and open, green areas that come in different shapes and sizes. But how to design an appropriate planning system for this environment? Mixing “red” (urban) and “green” (<b>rural)</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses,</b> for instance, now becomes problematic as Dutch spatial planning has always focused primarily on the urban domain whereas planning of green areas has its origins in agricultural land consolidation policy. A genuinely integrated approach to the planning of built-up areas and green areas in the open spaces is a distant ideal in this setting. In addition, the regional administrative level, being so important for metropolitan spatial challenges, needs reinforcing. The authors make a plea for a reframing {{of the notion of}} spatial planning at the national and provincial geographical and administrative scale. It takes a new object for planning, design and analysis to do the trick. The traditional rural–urban opposition is traded for “metropolitan landscape”, a new image reflecting the integration of built-up and non-built-up distinctively urban and <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses.</b> Planning for the metropolitan landscape requires a reassignment of duties and responsibilities among national, provincial and municipal governments and other stakeholders...|$|R

50|$|The {{mixture of}} {{suburban}} and <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> continued in Willowbrook {{into the early}} 1980s, when the area began to lose its rural character due to a redevelopment plan drafted by the Watts Labor Community Action Committee {{under the leadership of}} Ted Watkins from 1965 to 1993 and supported by Los Angeles County. Under this plan, 365 acre of Willowbrook land was redeveloped to provide new commercial and residential facilities, including a hospital, service station, poultry farm, grocery store, laundry, furniture and appliance shop, and food stamp centers. As a result, present-day Willowbrook appears similar to other communities in the South Central section of Los Angeles.|$|R
40|$|Arguably, <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> {{markets in}} Australia are {{currently}} in a high state of flux, with a panoply of competing interests seeking to capitalize on both the traditional {{and a range of}} newly emergent values anchored in land. Amenity-led migration is, we argue, an important strand of this renewed interest in <b>rural</b> <b>lands,</b> albeit one that is highly spatially selective. Employing a predictive and synoptic model of migration attractiveness across southeastern and southwestern Australia, we test its associations with migration currents into and out of rural communities for the 1990 s and 2000 s. This article finds that communities with high relative accessibility-to metropolitan and urban centers and the coast-and an established or emerging tourism industry have been most likely to experience net migration gains. Yet amenity migration also intersects with more traditional <b>rural</b> <b>land</b> <b>uses</b> and, in particular, irrigated agriculture.

40|$|Multispectral scanner data, {{obtained}} over Marion County (Indianapolis), Indiana at {{an altitude}} of 915 kilometers, were analyzed by computer-implemented techniques to evaluate the utility of satellite data for urban <b>land</b> <b>use</b> classification. Several <b>land</b> <b>use</b> classes, such as commerce/industry, single-family (newer) residential, trees, and water exhibited spectrally separable characteristics and were identified with greater than 90 per cent accuracy.

The confusion between these two classes was largely eliminated, however when spectral characteristics of samples (instead of individual data points) were considered.
