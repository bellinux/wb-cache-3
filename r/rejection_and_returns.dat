40|$|Background. Optimal {{glycaemic}} targets following transplantation are unknown. Understanding {{the impact}} of DM and posttransplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) may improve patient and graft survival in transplant recipients. Aim. To determine the perioperative and one-year outcomes after renal transplantation and whether these outcomes are affected by preexisting DM, PTDM, or glycaemia during transplant admission. Method. Adult recipients of renal transplants from a single centre over 5. 5 years were retrospectively reviewed. Measured outcomes during transplant admission included glycaemia and complications (infective complications, acute <b>rejection,</b> <b>and</b> <b>return</b> to dialysis) <b>and,</b> at 12 months, glycaemic control and complications (cardiovascular complication, graft failure). Results. Of 148 patients analysed, 29 (19. 6 %) had DM and 27 (18. 2 %) developed PTDM. Following transplantation, glucose levels were higher in patients with DM and PTDM. DM patients had a longer hospital stay, had more infections, {{and were more likely}} return to dialysis. PTDM patients had increased rates of acute <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> <b>return</b> to dialysis. At 1 year after transplant, there were more cardiovascular complications in DM patients compared to those without DM. Conclusions. Compared to patients without DM, patients with DM or PTDM are more likely to suffer from complications perioperatively and at 12 months. Perioperative glycaemia is associated with graft function and may be a modifiable risk...|$|R

Her mandate was to decorate his dining-room with Newmarket racing scenes and portraits of his friends, such as Arnold Bennett, Lady Louis Mountbatten, and Winston Churchill, {{on their way}} to the racecourse. The project was never completed as Beaverbrook became concerned that he would be daily faced with the portraits if he ever fell out with any of them. Beaverbrook paid Adshead a two-thirds <b>rejection</b> fee <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> the completed panels which were exhibited in a London department store in 1930. Later all but three of the panels were destroyed by fire whilst in storage. Adshead also painted a mural for the British Pavilion at the Paris International Exhibition of 1937.|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that most {{patients}} with end-stage kidney failure prefer treatment by transplantation. This entails taking immunosuppressant drugs daily throughout {{the life of the}} kidney. Failure to do so causes transplant <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> a <b>return</b> to dialysis, or sometimes even death. Up to 50 % of transplanted patients report failing to take their medication as prescribed. This qualitative study used focus groups to explore patients' lived experience in relation to medication adherence. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. The main themes to emerge were: fear of kidney failure, loyalty to the renal team and donors, health beliefs, forgetting and side-effects. Reasons for adherence were to avoid kidney failure and to acknowledge their gratitude to the renal team and donors. Participants suggested that non-adherence was largely due to forgetting...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of T-lymphocyte subpopulations bearing receptors for the Fc portion of IgG (TG) or IgM (TM) was monitored in 22 renal allograft recipients treated with immunosuppressive therapy and in 10 uraemic patients on haemodialysis. No {{significant difference in}} the {{distribution of}} T cells and T-cell subsets was found between normal controls and haemodialysed patients. In transplanted patients, however, a significant reduction of the total T-cell percentage (P less than 0. 005), of TM subset percentage (P less than 0. 025) and absolute number (P less than 0. 005) and of TG absolute number (P less than 0. 05) was observed. Considering patients with allografts functioning for more than 1 year only, the reduction in TM cells in terms of percentage (P less than 0. 0005) and absolute number (P less than 0. 025) was significant, while TG subset levels did not change significantly. In patients transplanted less than 1 year previous to our study, total T cells and T-cell subsets were reduced significantly only as absolute numbers. During the 1 st year we observed several increments of TM values towards normal levels, especially in the first 2 months after transplantation. During this period, TM subset levels sharply increased at acute <b>rejection</b> crisis <b>and</b> <b>returned</b> to previous values with rejection reversal. Our results suggest that the TM subset plays a prominent role in the mechanisms involved in the immunological response to allografts, and therefore repeated TM cell monitoring could be useful in the follow-up of renal transplant patients...|$|R

When her soul reaches heaven, she is confronted by God there as to how come she returned to heaven before completing her actual duration of life-span. She narrates her story of being rejected by Dhola. So God asked her what did she want. Rewa replied that she wanted Dhola to be her husband. In reply to her request, God said that Dhola is already destined to be husband of Maaru, and thus Rewa cannot have Dhola as her husband for the life-time but only for 12 years. And the story turns to after-birth of Dhola, Maaru and Rewa, where Dhola and Maaru are married in the childhood.|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{about the}} effects of social {{rejection}} on individuals’ social behaviors have produced mixed results and tend to study mating behaviors from a static point of view. However, mate selection in essence is a dynamic process, and therefore sociometer theory opens up a new perspective for studying mating and its underlying practices. Based on this theory and using self-perceived mate value in the relationship between heterosexual <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> mate choice as a mediating role, this current study examined the effects of heterosexual rejection on mate choice in two experiments. Results showed that heterosexual rejection significantly reduced self-perceived mate value, expectation, and behavioral tendencies, while heterosexual acceptance indistinctively increased these measures. Self-perceived mate value did not serve as a mediator in the relationship between heterosexual <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> mate expectation, but it mediated the relationship between heterosexual <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> mating behavior tendencies towards potential objects. Moreover, individuals evaded both <b>rejection</b> <b>and</b> irrelevant people when suffering from rejection...|$|R
