40|$|Bayesian {{approaches}} to variable selection {{have been widely}} used for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping. The Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for that aim are often difficult to be implemented for high-dimensional variable selection problems, such as the ones arising in epistatic analysis. Variational approximation is an alternative to MCMC, and variational linear regression (VLR) is an effective solution for the variable selection problems, but lacks accuracy in some QTL mapping problems where there are many more variables than samples. In this paper, we propose an effective method with aim to improve the accuracy of VLR in the case of above by dynamically <b>reducing</b> <b>components</b> (<b>variable</b> or markers) with known effects (zero or fixed). We show that the proposed method can greatly improve the accuracy of VLR with little increase in computational cost. The method is compared with several other variational methods used for QTL mapping, and simulation results show that its performance is higher than those methods when applied in high-dimensional cases...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{presents}} a quantification method {{for the potential}} benefits of applying geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> to an UCAV aero engine concept. The method includes thermodynamic modeling techniques for a set of geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> as well as an optimization strategy to find the optimal schedule of the geometry variations in dependence of flight condition, figure of merit and engine constraints. First, a conventional generic two-spool mixed-flow turbofan engine comprising state-of-the-art component technology is designed as a baseline configuration. Then this cycle is used to study the influence of individual geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> on the thermodynamic cycle and finally to quantify the performance gain at selected off-design conditions. This examination serves as a preliminary study for the design of an optimal variable cycle engine (VCE). It does not investigate the optimal design of <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> for a specific task. An optimization process chain based on the commercial software framework ModelCenter™ is developed and applied to find the optimal settings of the geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> for different figures of merit at certain flight conditions. Finally, the baseline configuration without <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> is compared to the variable cycle configuration and the benefits of the geometrically <b>variable</b> <b>components</b> are assessed for a generic UCAV mission. ...|$|R

Along with this, the use of the system for compensation of the <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> of the motor electromagnetic torque allows to decrease motor vibrations {{and the use of the}} system for compensation of the <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> of active power allows to decrease the heat overloads of the single motor phases, which increases the insulation life of the induction motor stator phase...|$|R

25|$|Principal {{component}} regression (PCR) is {{used when}} the number of predictor variables is large, or when strong correlations exist among the predictor variables. This two-stage procedure first <b>reduces</b> the predictor <b>variables</b> using principal <b>component</b> analysis then uses the <b>reduced</b> <b>variables</b> in an OLS regression fit. While it often works well in practice, there is no general theoretical reason that the most informative linear function of the predictor variables should lie among the dominant principal components of the multivariate distribution of the predictor variables. The partial least squares regression is the extension of the PCR method which does not suffer from the mentioned deficiency.|$|R
40|$|Four pigeons {{were exposed}} {{to a series of}} {{multiple}} schedules of variable-interval reinforcement in which pecks were required on one key (operant key) and components were signalled on a second key (signal key). Four additional pigeons experienced identical conditions, except that a yoking procedure delivered food on variable-time schedules, with no key pecks required. One of the components of the multiple schedule was constant throughout the experiment as a variable-interval (or variable-time) 30 -second schedule. Operant-key responding during the constant component was uniform throughout the component, uninfluenced by changes in the duration of the <b>variable</b> <b>component,</b> and only slightly influenced by changes in reinforcement frequency correlated with the <b>variable</b> <b>component.</b> By comparison, signal-key response rate during the constant component was highest {{at the onset of the}} component, was higher when the <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> was 60 -sec long than when it was 1 -sec long, and was higher when no reinforcement occurred in the <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> than when reinforcement was scheduled in the <b>variable</b> <b>component.</b> These characteristics of signal-key pecking matched characteristics of local positive behavioral contrast. These data are taken to support the “additivity theory” of behavioral contrast and to suggest that Pavlovian stimulus-reinforcer relations contribute primarily to the phenomenon of local positive contrast...|$|R

The rate of reinforcement for responding during one component schedule was held constant at 30 reinforcers per hour. The rate of reinforcement for responding during the other component varied from 0 to 120 or 240 reinforcers per hour. The schedules {{were presented in}} different orders for different subjects. The rate of responding emitted during the <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> schedule varied directly with the rate of reinforcement it provided.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{a method}} for the {{asymptotic}} analysis of generalized low-density parity-check (GLDPC) codes and doubly generalized low-density parity-check (D-GLDPC) codes over the binary erasure channel (BEC), based on extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) chart, is described. This method overcomes the problem consisting of the impossibility to evaluate the EXIT function for the check or <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> codes, in situations where the information functions or split information functions for component codes are unknown. According to the proposed technique, GLDPC codes and D-GLDPC codes where the generalized check and <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> codes are random codes with minimum distance at least 2, are considered. A technique is then developed which finds the EXIT chart for the overall GLDPC or D-GLDPC code, by evaluating the expected EXIT function for each check and <b>variable</b> <b>component</b> code. This technique is finally combined with the differential evolution algorithm in order to generate some good GLDPC and D-GLDPC edge distributions. Numerical results of long, random codes, are presented which confirm {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed approach.
