25|$|Six artillerists were {{adequate}} {{to serve a}} cannon, but to achieve maximum rates of fire larger crews were needed. The Canon de 12 Gribeauval was manned by a crew of 15 and drawn by 6 horses. Eight {{of the men were}} specialists. Single cannons were often commanded by a non-commissioned officer while two or more pieces were directed by an officer. The most experienced gunner stood behind and to the left, aiming and firing the cannon. A second gunner stood {{to the left of the}} cannon and loaded the cartridge and shot. The third gunner stood to the right with a rammer, mopping out the barrel after firing and ramming home a new round. Additional crewmen brought fresh ammunition to load, kept matches burning and the touch hole clear, repositioned the gun after firing, observed the fall of shot, drove the ammunition wagon (caisson) and held the horses. A trained 12-pounder crew could fire one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> A team of six horses pulled the 12-pounder and a team of four hauled each caisson.|$|E
25|$|The Obusier de 6 pouces Gribeauval {{was served}} by 13 crewmen and drawn by 4 horses. A second {{authority}} counted 13 {{men in the}} 6-inch howitzer crew, including eight specialists. A trained howitzer crew could fire one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> Normally, a single artillery piece was commanded by a non-commissioned officer while two or more were directed by an officer. The most experienced gunner stood behind {{and to the left}} of the piece; his task was to aim and fire. A second gunner was stationed {{to the left of the}} cannon; he loaded the cartridge and shell into the bore. The third gunner's station was to the right; he mopped out the barrel after a discharge and rammed home the cartridge and shell. Other crewmen were assigned to bring up fresh ammunition, keep matches burning and the cannon's touch hole clear, position the cannon to fire, observe the shell's trajectory, drive the ammunition wagon and hold the horses. Though as few as six men could operate a field piece, it was necessary to assign a larger crew in order to maintain a high rate of fire in combat.|$|E
25|$|Primary {{armament}} {{consists of}} 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun with fume extractor {{almost at the}} end of the barrel. It is the same gun as the one used in the Type 63 amphibious light tank and can fire AP, APHE, HE, Frag-HE, HEAT, APFSDF-T and smoke rounds. The gun has maximum range of 12,200 m and maximum aimed range of 1,870 m and has a rate of fire of 3 to 5 <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> The Type 62 light tank is characterized by having poor accuracy, given the primitive optical gun sights that the gunner has to use and lack of a gun stabilizer (which differs it from Chinese main battle tanks), a fire control system and night vision equipment. As a secondary armament the Type 62 light tank was given the 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun (Chinese copy of Soviet 12.7mm DShK 1938/46 heavy machine gun) mounted on a rotatable mount on top of the loader's hatch on the right hand side of the roof of the turret and two 7.62mm Type 59T medium machine guns, one mounted coaxially with the main gun and the other one mounted at the bow of the tank. Also a 7.62mm Type 59T anti-aircraft medium machine gun can be additionally fitted to left hand side turret hatch. The cast turret features the Soviet-style half-egg shape. The tank carriers 47 rounds for the 85mm Type 62-85TC rifled main gun, 2,000 rounds for the two Type 59T medium machine guns and 1,250 rounds for 12.7mm Type 54 anti-aircraft heavy machine gun.|$|E

500|$|Their main {{armament}} {{consisted of}} eight 12-inch (305mm) 50-caliber guns manufactured by Vickers. Each weighed [...] and fired an 850-pound (385kg) shell at a muzzle velocity of 3,000ft/s (914m/s). The guns had a maximum range of 23,500 yards (21,500 m) and {{a rate of}} fire of one <b>round</b> <b>per</b> <b>minute.</b> These guns were housed in four twin turrets, arranged with two on the centerline fore and aft, the others en echelon on the wings. The turrets were hydraulically operated, and could be loaded at any angle of elevation. The en echelon arrangement was chosen over superfiring turrets—such as those used in the American dreadnoughts—to save weight and cost. All four turrets could in theory fire on the broadside, and three could fire ahead or astern. However, blast effects from the wing turrets generally prohibited firing them across the deck or directly ahead and astern.|$|E
