40|$|Background: Youths {{constitute}} {{a high proportion}} of the total population in both global and local context. Under utilization of reproductive health (RH) services by this population sub group is a problem of concern globally and locally. Such insufficient utilization of these important services leaves youths at a high risk of suffering from different RH problems such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs/HIV), unsafe abortions and early pregnancies, which will in turn affect their growth and development. Objectives: The main objective {{of this study was to}} determine the utilization of RH services among secondary school youths in Iringa municipality and possible barriers towards utilizing the services. Methodology: An analytical cross sectional survey employing a triangulation of quantitative and qualitative data collection methods was used. Information from the youths focusing on their experience in use of RH services was collected using a school based survey. In addition, a total of four focus group discussion sessions were conducted among the youths to explore barriers they encounter while seeking RH services. Furthermore, key informant interviews were used to explore attitudes towards providing RH services to youths among <b>RH</b> <b>clinic</b> in-charges working in selected health facilities. Data was analyzed using SPSS computer software and a logistic regression analysis of the factors associated with perceptions of youths on available RH services was performed. Thematic analysis was done for data emanating from the focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Results: Findings revealed high awareness of RH among male (97. 8 %) and female (95. 9 %) youths. Less than half of them reported to have ever sought RH services at a health facility (41. 6 % male and 36. 0 % females). Overall, the youths showed a positive perception (69. 8 %) and rating of service provider attitudes (70. 4 %) and health facility characteristics (58. 7 %). Negative attitudes of service providers, fee for the services, lack of essential drugs and equipment and feeling shy to seek the services were among vii barriers cited by youths and service providers in the focus group discussions and key informant interviews conducted. Conclusion and Recommendations: This study brought to light the perceptions of secondary school youths on the available RH services, their ratings of the service provider attitudes and health facility characteristics in Iringa Municipality. It is therefore recommended that the training of service providers on provision of youth friendly services be scaled up, the fee for RH related treatments to the youths should be waived and health facility characteristics be adjusted to attract and retain more youths to the services...|$|E
40|$|The {{cross-sectional}} 24 h ambulatory {{blood pressure}} (BP) monitoring (ABPM) study by de la Sierra et al. reported 37. 5 % incidence of isolated-office (“white-coat“) resistant hypertension (<b>RH),</b> defined as <b>clinic</b> BP ≥ 140 / 90 mmHg plus 24 h BP mean 3 medications/daily is true RH, regardless of BP values; accordingly, inclusion of RH patients treated with ≥ 4 medications would decrease {{the prevalence of}} white-coat RH to 24. 6 %; (ii) RH is characterized by high prevalence of nocturnal hypertension and abnormal non-dipper BP pattern; current guidelines designate separate diagnostic thresholds for daytime and nighttime ABPM means; mean nighttime BP ≥ 120 / 70 mmHg should be considered hypertensive, regardless of mean daytime or clinic BP. The investigator-promoted, government-funded Hygia Project, designed to prospectively evaluate cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in primary care centers of Northwest Spain using highly reproducible 48 h ABPM, substantiates elevated sleep-time BP is highly prevalent in diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and RH, and significantly more frequent than elevated daytime BP. Furthermore, prevalence of isolated-office hypertension was up to three times higher when defined only by the daytime BP mean, than jointly by the daytime and nighttime BP means. Despite current recommendations, use of the 24 h BP mean to diagnose isolated-office hypertension, as done by de la Sierra et al., is inadequate; a “normal” 24 h BP mean is not a guarantee of a normal nighttime BP mean. Subjects with the same 24 h BP mean might have a BP pattern ranging from extreme-dipping to rising (asleep BP mean > awake BP mean), with potentially markedly different CVD risk. Elevated sleep-time BP is a better predictor of CVD risk than awake or 24 h BP means, and treatment-induced reduction of sleep-time BP in hypertension has been prospectively shown {{to be the most}} significant independent predictor of event-free survival. In conclusion, de la Sierra et al. cannot challenge findings from randomized, prospective clinical trials consistently reporting that bedtime ingestion of hypertension medications improves BP control and increases CVD event-free survival of RH patients...|$|R
