30|$|Camarero’s (2007) {{study shows}} that the market-driven {{financial}} and insurance companies are more committed to meeting or exceeding their customers’ expectations and as such, to providing premium service quality for their customers.

This paper contains some results {{from an earlier}} draft entitled “Voluntary or Mandatory Retirement, ” while other results from that Saving for retirement is a primary end purpose of {{many parts of the}} financial sector, including pension plans, life insurance, and indeed much of <b>retail</b> banking and <b>brokerage.</b> This paper and a companion paper develop a group of workhorse models that can be adapted to answer many questions of personal finance. This paper focuses on retirement (modeled as irreversible) and constrained borrowing. This paper has three simple models that can be solved explicitly, at least parametrically up to the determination of a few parameters. All three models have realistic features such as a hazard rate of mortality, preference for working or not, a possible bequest motive, and wage income that can vary stochastically over time. A companion piece has models with time-dependent features, permitting the hazard rate of mortality, average wage level, and preference for working to be exogenous functions of time. Consumption and portfolio choice can both jump at the endogenous retirement date. Consumption can jump because preferences are different after retirement. This could be due to househol...|$|R
