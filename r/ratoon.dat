A field experiment was conducted at the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta, Nigeria in 2007 / 2008 and 2008 / 2009 cropping season to compare the performance of sowing methods. Dry dibble broadcast, pre-germinated broadcast, dry dibble, transplanted and pre-germinated broadcast methods of early maturing New Rice for Africa 1 (NERICA 1) upland rice were compared with <b>ratooned</b> crop of New Rice for Africa Lowland rice (NERICA-L) genotypes (NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 26, NERICA-L 44, NERICA-L 41 and OFADA) in the niche between lowland rice and dry season cropping. The first crop was planted in May while {{the second and third}} were in September and December. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with three replicates. The mean plant height, grains panicle - 1, panicles m - 2, 1000 -grain weight and grain yield of lowland rice varieties were 126. 5 cm, 220, 173, 29. 3 g, and 7. 75 t ha - 1, respectively. The <b>ratooned</b> lowland rice flowered earlier (28 - 37 days) than the upland rice sowing methods (66 - 77 days). <b>Ratooned</b> crops of NERICA-L 20, NERICA-L 26 and NERICA-L 44 had highest number of panicles m - 2 and grain yield while pre-germinated dibble upland rice and <b>ratooned</b> crop of OFADA had the least panicles m - 2 and grain yield, respectively.

40|$|A three-year {{study on}} the {{practice}} of <b>ratooning</b> of sorghum was conducted in Eastern Kenya (1999 to 2002), with emphasis on the stem borer (Chilo partellus) and covered kernel smut (Sporisorium sorghi Ehrenberg Link). <b>Ratooning</b> is the practice of stimulating tillering by cutting the old straw after harvest (Doggett, 1988). A six season on-station experiment in Machakos District showed the practice of <b>ratooning</b> short duration sorghum increased the reliability and yields in comparison to a direct sown with yield ranges of 1630 - 1778 kg/ha and 0 - 148 kg/ha, respectively. The higher number of heads and stems per unit area meant the <b>ratooned</b> crop had higher level of stem borers per unit area than the direct sown crop and when infected with covered kernel smut was a greater source of inoculum. Unlike the incidence of CKS, the number of stem borers had little correlation with the numbers in the previous season’s crop; there was no upward trend {{to the number of}} stem borers per stem during the experiment suggesting factors other than the presence of a sorghum crop have a stronger influence on the population. Yield loss was an interaction between cultivar*incidence of stem borers * stage of infestation * rain quantity and distribution, but rain was the most important factor. An on-station trial in Kitui (2001 - 2) found the <b>ratooned</b> crop outperformed the direct sown crop in yield by a factor of three and non-cutting of stems produced a similar yield to cutting back stems after harvest. The different ‘ratoon’ methods did not significantly affect the incidence of covered kernel smut or level of stem borers. On-farm trials in Mwingi District (2000 - 2) showed that short duration sorghum <b>ratooned</b> outperformed direct sown sorghum. The timing of the cutting back of the stems had an effect on plant survival and yield; cutting back stems at harvest produced higher yields than cutting the stems at the on-set of rains, however cutting the stems at the onset of rains increased plant survival when the stems were dry at harvest. A decision tree was produced outlining the decisions a farmer needs to make when deciding whether or not to practice <b>ratooning.</b> Four factors were identified as important for varieties to perform well under the practice of ratooning: drought tolerance, stem strength, non-senescence and the ability to produce tillers during growth stage 3...|$|R

Sampling in three outbreak areas during 1994 showed that the insect's annual cycle varied according to the agroecological zone and rice cropping pattern. In the humid forest zone, Orseolia oryzivora persisted through the short dry season on <b>ratoons</b> of cultivated rice Oryza sativa at a rainfed site and on dry season rice crops at an irrigated one. In contrast, at rainfed sites in the moist savannah zone the pest survived the longer dry season on the perennial wild rice O. longistaminata, while <b>ratoons</b> and volunteers of O. sativa provided 'bridges' between the wild host and wet season rice crops. Early in the wet season at rainfed sites, galls of Orseolia oryzivora were not found at high density on wild rice, <b>ratoons</b> or volunteers.

40|$|The current {{management}} {{recommendation for}} papaya (Carica papaya) plants exhibiting symptoms of yellow crinkle disease in Australia is {{the practice of}} <b>ratooning</b> infected plants. <b>Ratooning</b> involves removing the main stem of diseased papaya plants and allowing a lateral stem (supposedly pathogen-free) to develop and replace the diseased stem. Using nonparametric and parametric methods of survival analysis, we tested different hypotheses regarding plant factors that may influence the postincubation period survival time of phytoplasma-infected papaya. The factors included plant age, the season (wet versus dry) when papaya plants first became symptomatic, and the two predominant phytoplasma strains causing papaya yellow crinkle: tomato big bud (TBB) or sweet potato little leaf strain V 4 (SPLL-V 4). Median survival time {{was estimated to be}} from 4 to 5 months.

40|$|In Peninsular India medium {{duration}} pigeonpeas (Cajanus cajan) {{are normally}} sown {{soon after the}} onset of the monsoon, in June or July; they mature around December, when they are usually cut down and removed from the field. However, if they are harvested by <b>ratooning</b> or by picking the pods, the plants go on to produce a second flush of pods, which matures around March. In experiments conducted in four growing seasons at ICRISAT Center, second harvest yields were usually greater for non-ratooned than <b>ratooned</b> plants, and in experiments conducted on Vertisols they were greater for the plants <b>ratooned</b> high up in the plant than for those cut closer to the ground. Second harvest yields of non-ratooned plants without irrigation on Alfisols were on average 66 % of the first harvest yields, but on Vertisols only 37 %, in spite of the greater water-holding capacity of the latter. On Alfisols second harvest yields were approximately doubled by a single irrigation, but there was less response to irrigation on Vertisols. The poorer second harvest yields on Vertisols may have been due to the damaging effects of soil cracking on the root system of the plants. In non-ratooned plants from which the first and second flushes of pods were harvested together, yields were less than the total yield obtained from non-ratooned plants in two harvests, even though the yield loss, mainly due to pod shattering, was as little as 4 % in one year.

A putative oligosaccharyl transferase showed the highest degree of rhizome-specific expression, with several transcriptional or regulatory protein complex factors also showing high (but lesser) degrees of specificity. Inferred by the upstream sequences of their putative rice (Oryza sativa) homologs, sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) genes that were relatively highly expressed in rhizome tip tissues were enriched for cis-element motifs, including the pyrimidine box, TATCCA box, and CAREs box, implicating the gibberellins in regulation of many rhizome-specific genes.
