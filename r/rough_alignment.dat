50|$|Drift {{alignment}} is {{a method}} to refine the polar alignment after a <b>rough</b> <b>alignment</b> is done.

For the polar axis altitude adjustment, one can attempt to track a star low in the east or west. For the azimuth adjustment, one typically attempts to track a star close to the meridian, with declination about 20° from the equator, in the hemisphere opposite of the observing location.|$|E

In the 18th century, the King's Highway ran between Dover and Wilmington; south of Dover it continued southeast toward Lewes. By the later part of that century, a post road ran from Horn Town, Virginia north across the Delmarva Peninsula. The road ran between Dover and Wilmington, where it continued northeast to the Pennsylvania border and headed toward Philadelphia. In 1813, the Wilmington and Philadelphia Turnpike Company was chartered to build a turnpike running from the Brandywine Bridge in Wilmington northeast to the Pennsylvania border, where the roadway would continue to Philadelphia. A 3.75 mi long portion of the road near Wilmington was finished in 1816 with the remainder completed in 1823. With the Federal Aid Road Act of 1916, the Philadelphia Pike was to be improved by the state. The Philadelphia Pike was upgraded to a state highway by 1920.

30|$|Registration {{methods can}} be roughly {{classified}} {{into three categories}} according to the DOF of their transformation models. Rigid registration has a DOF of 6 and allows for global translations and rotations. Affine registration, i.e., linear registration, allows for translation, rotation, scaling and skew of the images. Rigid and affine registration methods are usually sufficient for registering the multimodal datasets of same subject. However, deformable registration, which supports local deformations, is frequently needed to register images with large differences, e.g., registering an image to a template, or registering pre- and post-contrast images of the same subject. Deformable registration always requires rigid or affine registration to obtain a <b>rough</b> initial <b>alignment.</b> In many multimodal studies, {{a combination of these}} registration methods were used. For example, we recently jointly analyzed the ADNI FDG-PET and T 1 -weighted MRI datasets to classify AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients [79]. The PET images were aligned to MRI using an affine registration method (FSL FLIRT) [120]. The MRI datasets were registered to the MNI template using a deformable method (IRTK) [121], and the output registration coefficients by IRTK were applied to register the PET images to the same template. There are many other widely used registration algorithms, such as B-Spline registration [119, 122], Demons [123], and SyN [124], and ITK [54] registration framework is a standard-bearer for all of these popular registration methods.|$|R

This paper addresses the problem of building complete 3 D micro-object models from measurements in the submicrometric range. More specifically, it considers measurements provided by an atomic-force microscope (AFM) and investigates their possible use for the modeling of small 3 D objects. The general approach for building complete virtual models requires to measure and merge several data sets representing the considered object observed under different orientations, or views. A straightforward application of this scheme fails when acquisition methods for micro-objects, due to physical constraints, cannot provide the required positioning information for aligning the different views. The presented approach proposes to use an a posteriori software registration procedure that aligns views by registering common overlapping parts.

With the increasing demand of automatic palmprint authentication systems, the development of accurate and robust palmprint verification algorithms has been attracting a lot of interests.

A detailed study of the dependence of the CNT layer structure and thickness on growth time set the basis for the assessment of supercapacitors assembled with the CNTs/Al electrodes. As the main features of the layer growth evolution, an increase in the population of finer CNTs and a shift from a random entanglement to a <b>rough</b> vertical <b>alignment</b> of nanotubes were noted with proceeding growth. The growth time influence on the performance of supercapacitors was in fact apparent. Particularly, the specific capacitance of CNTs/Al electrodes in 0. 5 M K 2 SO 4 aqueous electrolyte increased from 35 to 80 F g- 1 as the CNT layer thickness varied from 20 to 60 mm, with a concurrent loss in rate capability (knee frequency from 1 kHz to 60 Hz). The latter was excellent in general, arguably due to both a fast ion transport through the interconnected CNT network and a negligible contribution of the active layer/current collector contact to the equivalent series resistance (0. 15 – 0. 22 mV g), a distinct advantage of the direct growth fabrication method. Overall, a relatively simple process of direct growth of CNTs on Al foils is shown to be an effective method to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes, notably in the absence of special measures and processing steps finalized to a tight control of nanotubes growth and organization...|$|R

In particular, the study on detecting human-related video events in complex scenes with both a crowd of people and dynamic motion is still limited. In this paper, we investigate detecting video events that involve elementary human actions, e. g. making cellphone call, putting an object down, and pointing to something, in complex scenes using a novel spatio-temporal descriptor based approach. A new spatiotemporal descriptor, which temporally integrates the statistics of a set of response maps of low-level features, e. g. image gradients and optical flows, in a space-time cube, is proposed to capture the characteristics of actions in terms of their appearance and motion patterns. Based on this kind of descriptors, the bag-of-words method is utilized to describe a human figure as a concise feature vector. Then, these features are employed to train SVM classifiers at multiple spatial pyramid levels to distinguish different actions. Finally, a Gaussian kernel based temporal filtering is conducted to segment the sequences of events from a video stream taking account of the temporal consistency of actions. The proposed approach is capable of tolerating spatial layout variations and local deformations of human actions due to diverse view angles and <b>rough</b> human figure <b>alignment</b> in complex scenes. Extensive experiments on the 50 -hour video dataset of TRECVid 2008 event detection task demonstrate that our approach outperforms the well-known SIFT descriptor based methods and effectively detects video events in challenging real-world conditions...|$|R
