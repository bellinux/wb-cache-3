IrI a standard aluminum etching mixture containing C 12 and BC 13 almost all the light emitted at energies exceeding 8. 8 eV was due to neutral atomic chlorine. Optical trapping of the WV radiation in the discharge complicates calculations of VUV fluxes to the wafer. However, we see total photon fluxes to the wailer at energies above 8. 8 eV on the order of 4 x 1014 photons/cm 2 sec with anon- reactive wafer and 0. 7 x 10 ` 4 photons/cm 2 sec with a reactive wtier. The maj ority of the radiation observed was between 8. 9 and 9. 3 eV. At these energies, the photons have enough energy to create electron-hole pairs in Si 02, but may penetrate up to a micron into the Si 02 before being absorbed. Relevance of these measurements to vacuum-W photon-induced darnage of Si 02 during etching is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Recent lineage tracing {{studies showed}} that the {{prostate}} basal and luminal cells in adult mice are two independent lineages under the physiological condition, but basal cells are capable of generating luminal progenies during bacterial infection-induced prostatitis. Because acute bacterial infection in human prostate tissues is relatively rare, the disease relevance of the bacterial infection-induced basal-to-luminal differentiation is uncertain. Herein we employ a high fat diet-induced sterile prostate inflammation model to determine whether basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by inflammation irrespective of the underlying etiologies. A K 14 -CreER model and a fluorescent <b>report</b> <b>line</b> are utilized to specifically label basal cells with the green fluorescent protein. We show that high fat diet promotes immune cell infiltration into the prostate tissues and basal-to-luminal differentiation. Increased cell proliferation accompanies basal-to-luminal differentiation, suggesting a concurrent regulation of basal cell proliferation and differentiation. This study demonstrates that basal-to-luminal differentiation can be induced by different types of prostate inflammation evolved with distinct etiologies. Finally, high fat diet also accelerates initiation and progression of prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia that are originated from basal cells with loss-of-function of the tumor suppressor Pten. Because prostate cancer originated from basal cells tends to be invasive, our study also provides an alternative explanation for the association between obesity and aggressive prostate cancer...|$|E

Previous studies using in vitro stem cell assays have {{suggested}} that the CD 133 -expressing prostate basal cells may serve as the putative prostate stem cells. However, the precise localization of the CD 133 -expressing cells and their contributions to adult murine prostate homeostasis in vivo remain undetermined. We show that loss of function of CD 133 does not impair murine prostate morphogenesis, homeostasis and regeneration, implying a dispensable role for CD 133 in prostate stem cell function. Using a CD 133 -CreERT 2 model in conjunction with a fluorescent <b>report</b> <b>line,</b> we show that CD 133 is not only expressed in a fraction of prostate basal cells, but also in some luminal cells and stromal cells.

Similarly, CD 133 + and CD 133 − luminal cells are functionally equivalent in maintaining the luminal cell lineage. Collectively, our study demonstrates that CD 133 does not enrich for the stem cell activity in vivo in adult murine prostate.

Air- and self-broadening coefficients were measured {{as a function of}} temperature; line mixing via off-diagonal relaxation matrix element coefficients was also obtained for 47 transition pairs. In total, nearly 1517 positions and intensities were retrieved, but many transitions were too weak for the line shape study. For this analysis, we used 25 high-resolution (0. 0056 and 0. 0067 cm(ex[- 1) and high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra of high-purity 12 CH 4 and the same high-purity 12 CH 4 broadened by dry air recorded at different sample temperatures between 130 K and 295 K with the Bruker IFS 125 HR Fourier transform spectrometer at JPL. Three different absorption cells were used (1) a White cell set to a path length of 13. 09 m for room temperature data, (2) a single-pass 0. 2038 m long coolable cell (for self-broadening) and (3) a multipass cell with 20. 941 m total path coolable Herriott cell (for air-broadening).

Emission spectra {{of this kind}} could serve as wavelength calibrators for high-resolution astrophysical spectrographs in the near-infrared, where only very few calibration sources are currently available. The compilation of a spectral line list and the characterization of line intensities and line density belong to the initial steps when investigating the feasibility of potential wavelength calibration sources. Although the molecular nitrogen spectrum was extensively studied in the past, to our knowledge, no line list exists that covers a continuous range of several thousand wavenumbers in the near-infrared. We recorded three high-resolution (Δν̃ = 0. 018 cm^- 1) spectra of a nitrogen gas discharge operated at different microwave powers. The nitrogen gas is kept inside a sealed glass cell at a pressure of 2 mbar. The emission lines in the spectra were fitted by a superposition of Gaussian profiles to determine their position, relative intensity, and width. The line parameters were corrected for an absolute wavelength scale, instrumental line broadening, and intensity modulation. Molecular and atomic transitions of nitrogen were identified with available line positions from the literature.

40|$|International audienceOH 231. 8 + 4. 2, a bipolar outflow {{around a}} Mira-type {{variable}} star, displays a unique molecular richness amongst circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) around O-rich AGB and post-AGB stars. We <b>report</b> <b>line</b> {{observations of the}} HCO+ and H 13 CO+ molecular ions and the first detection of SO+, N 2 H+, and (tentatively) H 3 O+ in this source. SO+ and H 3 O+ have not been detected before in CSEs around evolved stars. These data have been obtained {{as part of a}} full mm-wave and far-IR spectral line survey carried out with the IRAM 30 m radio telescope and with Herschel/HIFI. Except for H 3 O+, all the molecular ions detected in this work display emission lines with broad profiles (FWHM 50 - 90 km/s), which indicates that these ions are abundant in the fast bipolar outflow of OH 231. 8. The narrow profile (FWHM 14 km/s) and high critical densities (> 1 e 6 cm- 3) of the H 3 O+ transitions observed are consistent with this ion arising from denser, inner (and presumably warmer) layers of the fossil remnant of the slow AGB CSE {{at the core of the}} nebula. From rotational diagram analysis, we deduce excitation temperatures of Tex 10 - 20 K for all ions except for H 3 O+, which is most consistent with Tex 100 K. Although uncertain, the higher excitation temperature suspected for H 3 O+ is similar to that recently found for H 2 O and a few other molecules, which selectively trace a previously unidentified, warm nebular component. The column densities of the molecular ions reported here are in the range Ntot [1 - 8]x 1 e 13 cm- 2, leading to beam-averaged fractional abundances relative to H 2 of X(HCO+) 1 e- 8, X(H 13 CO+) 2 e- 9, X(SO+) 4 e- 9, X(N 2 H+) 2 e- 9, and X(H 3 O+) 7 e- 9 cm- 2.

40|$|South Australia will be {{the first}} Australian state to {{introduce}} legislation to remove children born to parents convicted of manslaughter or murder and place them under the custody of the relevant minister, the SA government announced recently. SA Coroner Mark Johns made the initial recommendation after investigating the many years of abuse and eventual death of four-year-old Chloe Valentine. Chloe was injured and died in 2012 after her mother and mother’s partner repeatedly put the girl on a 50 -kilogram bike and filmed her crashing into objects. Across Australia, 34 children were the victims of filicide – the killing of a child by a parent – in the two years leading up to 2012. In a well-coordinated and well-resourced child protection system, health staff, child protection workers and forensic specialists should already be collaborating to share information about children and families at risk of harm. These teams should be responding to the warnings some parents give prior to committing these crimes, then deciding whether parents convicted of murdering their children should have subsequent offspring removed. However, responses to high-risk pregnancy and high-risk infants across Australia could be described as haphazard, and legislation alone will not correct the problem. Uncharted territory South Australia’s move is not without precedent. New Zealand gave the court responsibility for the safety of subsequent children born to parents convicted of murder or manslaughter in 2013. However there is no publicly accessible data on the rate of removal and no evaluations to date. Importantly, the New Zealand legislation has some flexibility to work with parents convicted of murder or manslaughter, but the onus is on the parent to demonstrate they are safe to parent subsequent children. We have strong research detailing the demographics of parents who kill children and other contributing factors, such as psychotic depression, parental separation, retribution for leaving a relationship, domestic violence, fatal maltreatment, substance use and so on. Researchers have also made a number of suggestions about {{what can be done to}} prevent filicide aside from removing children, such as treating mental illness and introducing safe havens for anonymous birthing. But there has been no evaluation of what works and what doesn’t. The ethics of designing a research project that compares treatments, interventions or approaches to protect subsequent children of those who commit filicide over time is an understandable barrier. Logistical barriers While the intent of the South Australian legislation to prevent harm is noble, it doesn’t address the barriers that currently exist in the child protection system. First, the plan assumes we know who has been convicted of the manslaughter or murder of their child. The judicial and law enforcement sector knows who these people are. However, other agencies with crucial involvement in child protection only know if they are told by law enforcement. The law enforcement sector cannot be responsible for actively tracking the reproductive activity of those convicted of the manslaughter or murder of children for the term of convicted person’s life. Removal “at birth” also implies that the health department has been informed of the previous conviction, that the child protection agency knows the woman is pregnant and that they know where the woman will give birth. By linking the removal “at birth”, the focus is on the woman and does not account for the paternity of the child. It’s unclear how this approach will include males previously convicted who may or may not be identified as the biological father of the unborn/newborn or current partner of the pregnant woman. Responding to high-risk pregnancies Child protection authorities were first notified about Chloe Valentine during her mother’s pregnancy. According to the Coroner, a report to the Child Abuse <b>Report</b> <b>Line</b> described Chloe’s mother as “dirty”, “smelly”, “unhygienic”, “taking drugs and drinking”, and “not obtaining proper antenatal medical treatment”. It is not uncommon for child welfare risks to emerge during pregnancy. Indicators of possible future harm to the child include suicide risk, serious and persistent substance use, being a victim of domestic violence, homelessness and inadequate preparations for birth. Child protection legislation, risk studies and structured decision-making tools are commonly employed in child protection situations to assess and respond to risk. One of the key planks in the platform to monitor pregnant women at risk of domestic violence, unmanaged mental illness and substance use, is the unborn child high risk birth alert operating in some jurisdictions. Some states have legislation to support the prenatal reporting of children at risk. In states or territories where there is no law specifically relating to unborn child information exchange, inter-agency collaboration protocols allow agencies to share information about unborn children. These policy responses are aimed at redressing the risks giving rise to the prenatal report, prior to the child’s birth; in other words, getting to the cause of maltreatment and working on those risks. But the patchwork of responses states and territories have to high-risk pregnancy and high-risk infants is problematic. There is also a risk that pregnant women under surveillance will avoid contact with services, such as avoiding antenatal care, deny they are pregnant, move to other jurisdictions to give birth, not register the child’s birth, and so on. Systems that seem to work best are integrated, supported by cross-agency policy and strive for active engagement with service users. Wrap-around intersecting interagency responses must be coordinated, backed by the legal sharing of child protection information. Systems that don’t work well are fragmented, typified by lack of collaboration and communication. Structural issues such as conflicting service mandates, under-resourcing and difference in practice frameworks can result in services being provided in silos to at-risk families, rather than in cooperation. This complex area requires a sophisticated response. There may be pockets where programs are operating well, but there is no systematic approach across the country, or even state-wide. Any risk-management system in child protection needs multilateral agency participation to ensure such a system delivers on what it is trying to do: protect subsequent children. • Rosemaria Flaherty, PhD candidate, Australian Centre for Child Protection, University of South Australia and Fiona Arney, Chair and Director, Australian Centre for Child Protection, University of South Australia This article was originally published on The Conversation.
