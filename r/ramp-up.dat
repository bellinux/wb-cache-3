Relative calibration of CASTOR is done using beam halo muons. To obtain relevant data, a dedicated CASTOR trigger was developed and activated during beam injections and <b>ramp-ups.</b> The triggered events correspond to an isolated particle penetrating the calorimeter parallel to the beam axis.

40|$|In November 2014, OPEC {{announced}} a new strategy geared towards improving its market share. Oil-market analysts interpreted this {{as an attempt to}} squeeze higher-cost producers, notably US shale oil, out of the market. Over the next year, crude oil prices crashed, with large repercussions for the global economy. We present a simple equilibrium model that explains the fundamental market factors that can rationalize such a “regime switch” by OPEC: (i) the growth of US shale oil production; (ii) the slowdown of global oil demand; (iii) reduced cohesiveness of the OPEC cartel; and (iv) production <b>ramp-ups</b> in other non-OPEC countries; while (v) reductions in US shale costs act against these factors. We show that these qualitative predictions are broadly consistent with oil market developments during 2014 - 15.

40|$|The {{self-organization}} of a tokamak plasma is {{a fundamental}} turbulent plasma phenomenon, {{which leads to the}} formation of a self-consistent pressure profile. This phenomenon has been investigated in the T- 10 tokamak in different experiments, excluding profiles with pronounced transport barriers. It will be shown that the normalized pressure profile can be expressed by the equation p(N) (r) = p(r, t) /p(0, t), over a wide range of plasma densities. It will also be shown that p(N) (r) is independent of the heating power and the deposition profile of electron cyclotron resonance heating. Experiments show that p(N) (r) depends only on the value of q at the plasma edge. During rapid current <b>ramp-ups</b> it has been demonstrated that the conservation of p(N) (r) is established during a time t(c) < 0. 1 tau(E), with tau(E) the energy confinement time.

The continuous transformation of the obtained data into deployable machining knowledge allows for faster <b>ramp-ups,</b> more reliable process outcome and higher profitability. A system for recording data from various sources - including a simultaneous material removal simulation - is implemented to aggregate and store process data. In addition to the simulation results, process data from the machine control, cutting forces and shape error samples are collected. A series of slot milling processes are carried out with varying cutting speed, feed per tooth and width of cut in a full factional design. In order to continuously evaluate process data, automatized methods are required. This is achieved using the simulation results to determine all relevant cutting conditions. Dependencies between cutting parameters, sensor signals and cutting result are identified and quantified. However, a one-dimensional model does not predict the shape error accurately. As an alternative model, a multidimensional model based on a Support Vector Machine is trained, using process forces and simulation data. The obtained prediction accuracy is significantly higher compared to the one-dimensional model and can be used to design highly reliable cutting processes...|$|R

Bulk isochronal and isothermal annealing of ion irradiated pure tungsten (2 MeV W+ ions, 500 degrees C, 10 ^ 14 W+/cm^ 2) with temperatures of 800, 950, 1100 and 1400 degrees C, from 0. 5 to 8 hours, was followed by ex situ characterisation of defect size, number density, Burgers vector and nature. Loops with diameters larger than 2 - 3 nm were considered for detailed analysis, among which all loops had b = 1 / 2 and were predominantly of interstitial nature. In situ annealing experiments from 300 up to 1200 degrees C were also carried out, including dynamic temperature <b>ramp-ups.</b> These confirmed an acceleration of loop loss above 900 degrees C. At different temperatures within this range, dislocations exhibited behaviour such as initial isolated loop hopping followed by large-scale rearrangements into loop chains, coalescence and finally line-loop interactions and widespread absorption by free-surfaces at increasing temperatures.

40|$|Background Elimination {{of malaria}} {{can only be}} {{achieved}} through removal of all vectors or complete depletion of the infectious reservoir in humans. Mechanistic models can be built to synthesize diverse observations from the field collected {{under a variety of}} conditions and subsequently used to query the infectious reservoir in great detail. Methods The EMOD model of malaria transmission was calibrated to prevalence, incidence, asexual parasite density, gametocyte density, infection duration, and infectiousness data from 9 study sites. The infectious reservoir was characterized by diagnostic detection limit and age group over a range of transmission intensities with and without case management and vector control. Mass screen-and-treat drug campaigns were tested for likelihood of achieving elimination. Results The composition of the infectious reservoir by diagnostic threshold is similar over a range of transmission intensities, and higher intensity settings are biased toward infections in children. Recent <b>ramp-ups</b> in case management and use of insecticide-treated bednets reduce the infectious reservoir and shift the composition toward submicroscopic infections. Mass campaigns with antimalarial drugs are highly effective at interrupting transmission if deployed shortly after ITN campaigns. Conclusions Low density infections comprise {{a substantial portion of the}} infectious reservoir. Proper timing of vector control, seasonal variation in transmission intensity, and mass drug campaigns allows lingering population immunity to help drive a region toward elimination.

40|$|AutoPyFactory (APF) is a {{next-generation}} pilot submission {{framework that}} has been used as part of the ATLAS workload management system (PANDA) for two years. APF is reliable, scalable, and offers easy and flexible configuration. Using a plugin-based architecture, APF polls for information from configured information and batch systems (including grid sites), decides how many additional pilot jobs are needed, and submits them. With the advent of cloud computing, providing resources goes beyond submitting pilots to grid sites. Now, the resources on which the pilot will run also need to be managed. Handling both pilot submission and controlling the virtual machine life cycle (creation, retirement, and termination) from the same framework allows robust and efficient management of the process. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of these virtual machine management capabilities of APF. Expanding on our plugin-based approach, we allow cascades of virtual resources associated with a job queue. A single workflow can be directed first to a private, facility-based cloud, then a free academic cloud, then spot-priced EC 2 resources, and finally on-demand commercial clouds. Limits, weighting, and priorities are supported, allowing free or less expensive resources to be used first, with costly resources only used when necessary. As demand drops, resources are drained and terminated in reverse order. Performance plots and time series will be included, showing how the implementation handles <b>ramp-ups,</b> ramp-downs, and spot terminations...|$|R

40|$|While {{the pace}} of {{technical}} innovation in the semiconductor industry continues to accelerate, business processes and supply chain techniques have not kept up. Microprocessor performance improvement continues to follow Moore's Law, but increased variability has complicated efforts to accurately forecast demand and set inventory targets. Products are becoming more complex, often containing assemblies of multiple parts. Lifecycles are becoming shorter; made possible by technology breakthroughs and efficient manufacturing <b>ramp-ups.</b> Demand and supply are ever more stochastic and non-stationary. Inventory {{is one of the}} few ways that a firm can buffer themselves from the inherent and increasing variability, while still meeting required service levels. We explore the sources of the variability in the semiconductor supply chain. On the supply side, we evaluate variability in throughput time, yield and other factors not explicitly considered in standard models. Here, we primarily focus on the natural stochasticity of the manufacturing process and disregard the variability arising from forecasting of these supply parameters. For demand, the natural stochastic process is not well understood, so we evaluate the forecast error and use it as a proxy for demand variability. We then apply these data to the base-stock model - constrained by its associated assumptions - to calculate inventory targets required to meet a certain level of service. Using a two-node base-stock model in conjunction with the actual variability data, we develop inventory estimates across the network and evaluate tradeoffs between different inventory strategies. We then determine what each variability parameter contributes to inventory. The combination of a simple yet representative(cont.) model of the semiconductor supply chain with actual data from the variability characterization provides the tools to make powerful recommendations to reduce variability and decrease inventories throughout the supply network. by Joseph C.

40|$|In {{the current}} and {{forecasted}} energy scenario, Natural Gas Combined Cycle (NGCC) power plants are requested increasingly flexible operation. The continuous changes in the capacity factor of the power plants and the increasing number and steepness of <b>ramp-ups</b> could largely affect the thermodynamic and economic performance of the plants and undermine their competitiveness. In order for industrial operators to adopt competitive strategies to increase {{the flexibility of the}} power plants, the effect that off-design operation has on the cost structure of plant products needs to be addressed. Thermoeconomics provides tools and models to meet such objective. The study presents an application of Thermoeconomic Input-Output Analysis (TIOA) to a NGCC power plant subject to flexible operation in Italy. The on- and off-design performance of the plant is assessed, considering two load control mechanisms for off-design operation: Inlet Guide Vanes (IGVs) with constant Turbine Outlet Temperature (TOT) or constant Turbine Inlet Temperature (TIT). The Input-Output model is derived from a detailed off-design Thermodynamic model designed in Thermoflow Thermoflex™, and it is stand-alone: it computes the cost structure of the plant products and the Thermoeconomic performance indicators as continuous functions of the gas turbine load, independently from the Thermodynamic model. In the first place, the on- and off-design models of the plant are set up. Secondly, the detailed economic cost analysis is performed. Eventually, the stand-alone Input -Output model is derived: the Technical Coefficients and the Input Coefficients are computed from the fuels and products in the Thermodynamic model at different loads; by regression of the obtained values, continuous functions of the load are derived for each coefficient; finally, the stand-alone model is designed, including these functions in the Leontief Inverse matrix. The results provide an evaluation of the off-design performance of the power plant for the two control strategies, and a tool for the choice of the most efficient one. After specialised analysts set up and run the off-design Thermodynamic model, the power plant operators may perform production scenarios and predictions through the stand-alone Input-Output model independently. This may help abate barriers for industrial practitioners, given by the complexity, computational effort and difficult interpretation of off-design thermodynamic and cost models...|$|R
40|$|The {{decision-making}} {{in production}} planning is commonly supported by analytical models. Although the models {{are getting more}} precise and capable through advancements in technology and model-building, human intervention is still often required. However, human planners are subject to biases and cognitive limitations which may question {{the value of the}} human intervention. The previous research has found out that human intervention arises among others from system inadequacy and misaligned incentives between the model and the human planner. Moreover, decision-makers are found to intervene also by habit or for the feeling of control. This thesis addresses human intervention in model-driven production planning in the field of hydroelectricity production. The monetary value of the discharge decisions is high due to volatile electricity prices and the task is challenging to human cognition. Moreover, uncertainties arise from the stochastic and seasonal prices, hydrological conditions and the delays of water flows between the consecutive plants. The operation of river systems is constrained by regulations related to environmental and recreational issues. A case study was conducted on a hydroelectricity producer which uses an optimization model to construct a short-term production plans. Over 80 % of the hourly recommendations obtained from the optimization tool were adjusted by the planners. The size of the adjustments was considerable; the size was on hourly level on average nearly 20 %. The intervention resulted to a plan with less hour-to-hour changes and rounded quantities of discharges. The planner routinely intervened because of feasibility factors, e. g. too many <b>ramp-ups</b> for the control room or unnecessary generator startups. Moreover, external factors such as planned maintenance had a significant impact when present. In total, the planner and the model achieved similar prices. However, especially when the planner intervened for external factors alone or together with feasibility factors, the achieved price was lower. On the contrary, when they only intervened for market-driven reasons, the achieved price was slightly higher. Since feasibility-related issues were the most common drivers for adjustments and these {{can be traced back to}} the optimization tool, the model could be improved to account for these. This would enable the planners to focus more on market-driven planning. Moreover, regular external factors, such as planned maintenance, could be included in the tool...|$|R
