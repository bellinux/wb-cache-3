50|$|The binding has the {{advantage}} of allowing the book to open fully, where traditional leather bindings are too rigid. It is sometimes modified to provide a <b>rounded</b> <b>spine.</b> This lends the appearance of a book where the paper is not suited to spine rounding; this is also to provide a <b>rounded</b> <b>spine</b> to a book too thin for a spine rounding to hold. The binding may also provide an impressive-looking leather spine to a book without incurring the full expense of binding a book in full or partial leather.|$|E

50|$|Prior to the 15th century, swell in textblocks was accommodated, if it all, by {{shaping the}} wooden boards that formed a book's covers. The inner surface of each board would be lightly tapered along the spine edge, {{so that the}} removed wood created a space for the thicker paper along the sewn folds. By the 15th century, though, the process of {{rounding}} and backing became common, and books were given their characteristic <b>rounded</b> <b>spines</b> and shoulders. This mushroom-like shape compensates for the swell of the book by using the extra thickness to create an extra surface against which the boards of the book can rest.|$|R

2500|$|Western {{books from}} the fifth century onwards were bound between hard covers, with pages made from {{parchment}} folded and sewn on to strong cords or ligaments that were attached to wooden boards and covered with leather. Since early books were exclusively handwritten on handmade materials, sizes and styles varied considerably, {{and there was no}} standard of uniformity. [...] Early and medieval codices were bound with flat spines, and {{it was not until the}} fifteenth century that books began to have the <b>rounded</b> <b>spines</b> associated with hardcovers today. Because the vellum of early books would react to humidity by swelling, causing the book to take on a characteristic wedge shape, the wooden covers of medieval books were often secured with straps or clasps. These straps, along with metal bosses on the book's covers to keep it raised off the surface that it rests on, are collectively known as furniture.|$|R

Cocconeis coronata Riaux-Gobin et Romero sp. nov. is similar to C. scutellum but has its own distinctive features. In external view, the concave raphe valve possesses uniseriate striae and a subsident hyaline marginal rim, while the strongly convex sternum valve has a submarginal, generally continuous crest, a hexagonal pattern of areolation, short, <b>rounded</b> <b>spines</b> that are often regularly arranged around valve face areolae, a complex areola hymen and small marginal chambers. Some morphometric differences were noted between the populations of C. coronata at Réunion and Rodrigues. Cocconeis margaritata Riaux-Gobin et Al-Handal, sp. nov. is smaller, possesses a sternum valve like that of C. placentula and C. neothumensis, but has denser striation and small pearl-like concretions around the areola aperture on the sternum valve. Several other taxa that resemble, or may be varieties of, C. margaritata require further study before being formally described. Cocconeis margaritata and C. coronata are small and relatively rare, so their study requires scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
50|$|As {{with most}} early trilobites, Peachella has an almost flat exoskeleton, {{that is only}} thinly calcified. It also shares {{crescent-shaped}} eye ridges, but these rise above the exoskeleton. As part of the Olenellina suborder, Peachella lacks dorsal sutures. Like all {{other members of the}} Olenelloidea superfamily, the eye-ridges spring {{from the back of the}} frontal lobe (L4) of the central area of the cephalon, that is called glabella. Peachella is an average sized biceratopsid trilobite, that exhibits the strongly effaced cephalic features that are typical for a clade wikthin the Biceratopsinae subfamily. It has the enormous sickle-shaped pleural spines on the 3rd thoracal segment with the rest of the Biceratopsidae family (except for Bolbolenellus). Peachella is unique in having short, wide, strongly inflated genal <b>spines,</b> with broadly <b>rounded</b> tips. The cephalon is semi-circular in outline with short, strongly inflated <b>rounded</b> <b>spines.</b> The central area of the cephalon (or glabella) is elongated, reaching the anterior border, but its features are strongly effaced, almost showing no furrows. The frontal 14 or 15 segments (or prothorax) can readily be distinguished from the terminal 9 to 11 (forming the opisthothorax). The last segment of the prothorax may carry a large spine. The tips of the pleura are rounded, which is unlike the usual pointed terminations in other Olenellina. The tailshield (or pygidium) is very small and subquadrate in shape.|$|R

Young rays are otherwise smooth-skinned, while older rays over 20 cm across gain a wide band of small, flattened, circular dermal denticles covering the median third of the back from between the eyes to the base of the tail, as well as small prickles covering the tail behind the sting. This ray is a plain grayish brown above, and whitish below. It reaches a maximum known disc width of 1 m and weight of 17 kg, though most do not exceed a width of 60 cm. Females grow larger than males.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the photoperiod on the biology and seasonal morphs of Dichelops melacanthus (Dallas, 1851) was studied in the laboratory. Four different photoperiods (11, 12, 13, and 14 hL = hours of light) were tested, keeping the temperature at 25 ± 1 ºC and the relative humidity at 65 ± 5 %. Nymph developmental time tended to be longer under shorter photophases (11 and 12 hL). The 14 -hour photophase (long day) resulted in lower nymph mortality rates. Females maintained at 13 and 14 hL showed greater weight gain (1 st- 28 th day) than females under 12 hL. D. melacanthus showed reproductive oligopause induced by short photophases, especially when exposed to 11 hL. Under 13 and 14 hL, 85 % and 65 % of females oviposited, respectively, in comparison to 10 % and 15 % of females ovipositing under 11 and 12 hL, respectively. Fecundity (number of egg masses and number of eggs/female) was greater in the longer than under the shorter photophases. Seasonal dimorphism induced by photoperiod was observed in D. melacanthus adults. Under short-day conditions (11 and 12 hL), adults showed short and <b>rounded</b> shoulder <b>spines,</b> grayish brown abdomen (mainly in 11 hL), high lipid contents, and lower percentage of mature reproductive organs. Under long-day conditions (13 and 14 hL), the stink bugs showed greatly developed shoulder spines, green abdomen, low lipid contents, and mature reproductive organs...|$|R
50|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight to a little concave. The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in A. caenosus and A. sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared to <b>rounded,</b> with a <b>spine</b> in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A. sylvanus, A. simulator, and A. budini but broader than in A. caenosus.|$|R
