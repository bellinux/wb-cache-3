5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} through {{the leadership of the}} Shawnee brothers, Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet). The conflict became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes that they would be protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against the white settlers. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to pay white traders only half of what they owed and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, muskets, and especially whiskey, which was becoming known as evil for American Indians.|$|E
5|$|As {{the club}} changed their name to Società Sportiva Calcio Napoli on 25 June 1964 {{they began to}} <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> again, gaining {{promotion}} in 1964–65. Under the management of former player Bruno Pesaola, they won the Coppa delle Alpi and were back amongst the elite in Serie A, with consistent top-five finishes. Napoli {{came very close to}} winning the league in 1967–68, finishing just behind Milan in second place. Some of the most popular players from this period were Dino Zoff, José Altafini, Omar Sívori and hometown midfielder Antonio Juliano. Juliano would eventually break the appearance records, which still stands today.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{say that}} if the {{government}} goes for the top of this range inflation could <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> to 40% through the economy. The International Monetary Fund, however, has predicted a more moderate rise in inflation of just 32 percent. As of January 2010, the official inflation rate stands at 15 percent. The cost of living in Iran, according to the Majlis Research Center, could rise by up to 60 percent. Ahmadinejad's administration contends that the negative side effects will be transient and that the projections are based on out-of-date models.|$|E
5|$|Darren Craig {{directed}} the song's music video, which Candy envisioned as a satire on political and socioeconomic repression {{of women and}} misogyny. In the video, Candy appears {{with a group of}} oppressed women who <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against a tyrannical man and shoot him with golden rifles. The visual attracted critical attention from media commentators, who discussed the possible inspirations for the women and the setting. Critics positively responded to the music video, complimenting it as vibrant and outrageous.|$|E
5|$|He was {{expected}} {{by some to}} mount a challenge for promotion to the Premiership in 2005–06, which was the club's first season in the new Ricoh Arena. The team started out poorly, but improved {{in the second half}} of the season to <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> the table, with Adams making an inspired signing in Dennis Wise. However, despite excellent home form, he could only guide Coventry as high as 8th, missing out on a play-off place by only two league places, though several points adrift of that year's standard.|$|E

5|$|In 1808, with Napoleon {{controlling}} much of Europe, a {{plan was}} conceived by Sir Robert Adair, ambassador to Venice, to extract Pope Pius VII from Rome. It {{was thought that}} the Pope in exile could encourage the Catholic countries of Spain and Italy to <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against Napoleon. Admiral Collingwood, Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, dispatched Alceste and an 18-gun sloop, , to Palermo where they arrived on 12 August. The British diplomat there, William Drummond, selected four priests willing to undertake the mission. They boarded Alceste and set sail on 26 August.|$|E
5|$|Napoli {{broke the}} world {{transfer}} record fee after acquiring Diego Maradona in a €12million deal from Barcelona on 30 June 1984. The squad was gradually re-built, {{with the likes}} of Ciro Ferrara, Salvatore Bagni and Fernando De Napoli filling the ranks. The <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> the tables was gradual, by 1985–86, they had a third-place finish under their belts, but better was yet to come. The 1986–87 season was the landmark in Napoli's history; they won the double, securing the Serie A title by three points and then beating Atalanta 4–0 to lift the Coppa Italia.|$|E

The Superior province is the largest preserved fragment of Archean crust, and the Canadian shield is the nucleus of the North American craton.|$|E

5|$|The Swedes {{were not}} {{popular in the}} regions that Sweden had gained at the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. With the new war going badly, insurgents saw their chance to <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against the unpopular rule. Swedish response, {{especially}} in Scania, was more subtle than one might believe. An all out terror campaign would have been economically disastrous. Instead small patrols searching the woods were often employed combined with promises of carrots or sticks to the local farmers.|$|E
5|$|The Wolds area {{takes the}} form of an elevated, gently rolling plateau, cut by {{numerous}} deep, steep-sided, flat-bottomed valleys of glacial origin. The chalk formation of the hills provides exceptionally good drainage, with the result that most of these valleys are dry. Surface water is quite scarce throughout the Wolds. At Flamborough Head the Wolds <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> to form high chalk cliffs, where there are water-worn caves and stacks along the shore. Flamborough Headland is designated a Heritage Coast. Coastal erosion around Flamborough Head has led to visitors being warned by the Humber Coastguard to be very careful on coastal paths.|$|E

5|$|The uprising's {{timing was}} fixed at 17 July, at 5:00p.m.; this was {{agreed to by}} {{the leader of the}} Carlists, Manuel Fal Condé. However, the timing was changed: the men in Spanish Morocco were to <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> at 5:00a.m. and those in Spain itself {{starting}} exactly a day later, so control of Spanish Morocco could be achieved and forces sent to Iberia from Morocco to coincide with the risings there. The rising was intended to be a swift coup d'état, but the government retained control of most of the country.|$|E

In general V.salvadorii avoids human contact, but its bite is capable of causing infection, like the Komodo dragon's. One fatality was reported from a bite in 1983 when a Papuan woman was bitten and later died from an infection.|$|E

5|$|A {{civil war}} between Stephen and the Empress Matilda soon broke out and Gilbert took his chance to <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against Stephen, seizing Ludlow Castle. Stephen responded by taking an army into the Welsh Marches, where he {{attempted}} to garner local support by marrying one of his knights, Joce de Dinan, to Sybil and granting the future ownership of the castle to them. Stephen took the castle after several attempts in 1139, famously rescuing his ally Prince Henry of Scotland when the latter was caught on a hook thrown over the walls by the garrison. Gilbert still maintained {{that he was the}} rightful owner of Ludlow, however, and a private war ensued between Joce and himself. Gilbert was ultimately successful and retook the castle around a few years {{before the end of the}} civil war in 1153. He ultimately left for the Levant, leaving Ludlow in the hands of firstly, his eldest son, Robert, and then, after Robert's death, his younger son, Hugh de Lacy.|$|E
5|$|A {{conflict}} between the new papal legate, Peter of Capua, and the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Peter of Angoulême, who had become Raymond-Roupen's supporter, ended with the excommunication of the patriarch. Exploiting the situation {{to get rid of}} his opponent, Bohemond replaced Peter of Angoulême with the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, SymeonII {{with the support of the}} commune in early 1207. Peter of Angoulême was reconciled with the legate, excommunicated Bohemond and the commune, and then persuaded some nobles to <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against Bohemond, forcing him to take refuge in the citadel. Leo entered Antioch, but Bohemond collected his forces and defeated the Armenians. Peter of Angoulême was captured and died of drink deprivation in his prison.|$|E
5|$|An Indian {{resistance}} movement against U.S. expansion {{had been growing}} around the Shawnee brothers Tecumseh and Tenskwatawa (The Prophet) that became known as Tecumseh's War. Tenskwatawa convinced the native tribes {{that they would be}} protected by the Great Spirit and no harm could befall them if they would <b>rise</b> <b>up</b> against the whites. He encouraged resistance by telling the tribes to only pay white traders half of what they owed, and to give up all the white man's ways, including their clothing, whiskey, and guns. In 1810, Tecumseh, with about 400 armed warriors, traveled to Vincennes where he confronted Harrison and demanded that the Treaty of Fort Wayne be rescinded. Although Harrison refused, the war party left peacefully, but Tecumseh was angry and threatened retaliation. After the meeting Tecumseh journeyed to meet with many of the tribes in the region, hoping to create a confederation with which to battle the Americans.|$|E
