In the identification process of the <b>rural</b> <b>settlements,</b> from the Someşan Plateau, we used those criteria which mostly highlight the degree of their vulnerability towards natural and anthropologic hazards (position, morphometry, morphology, demography). According to the mentioned criteria we analyzed the <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> distribution on the Someşan Plateau’s geographical subunits. This approach {{will allow us to}} assess the <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> vulnerability degree towards natural and anthropologic hazards and how they are spatially differenced in the studied area...|$|R
40|$|The {{population}} density of rural areas is generally lower than before due to rapid industrialization. Spatial optimized reconstruction of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> {{is the key}} to rural sustainable development. Analyzing the distribution characteristics of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> and their impact has profound implications for rural reconstruction. Several types of spatial distribution of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements,</b> such as clustered, random, and uniform discrete distribution, were found in China with significant regional differences. <b>Rural</b> <b>settlements</b> were denser in the southeastern regions compared to the northwestern regions. In regions such as plains, the spatial distribution of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> was denser and the spatial distribution modes were mainly random and disperse. In regions such as cold alpine areas and desert fringes, the <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> density was low and mainly clustered. In the transition zone between hills and mountains, the density of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> was high and the spatial distribution mode was mainly random. <b>Rural</b> <b>settlements</b> distribution was influenced by traditions and the economy, with economic development becoming increasingly influential. Additional factors that affected <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> distribution included average distance to main roadway, agricultural machinery, per capita grain production, per capita arable land, {{population density}}, elevation, precipitation, etc. Multiple distribution patterns should be used to reconstruct rural spaces in different geographical areas. Typical patterns included radially balanced, central land distribution mode; radially imbalanced distribution mode; multicore central land distribution mode, and corridor balanced and imbalanced distribution modes.

40|$|The {{study has}} further {{examined}} rural perception {{to the effects}} of climate change. The study used <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> in Otukpo, Nigeria as a case study. Primary and secondary data were utilised for the study. Data collection was done {{through the use of a}} questionnaire with open-ended questions and questions with multiple answers. A total of 100 questionnaires were randomly distributed among household heads in 10 settlements selected from 58 <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> for the study. Spatial distribution of the <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> were analysed using the nearest neighbour statistical analysis while descriptive statistics such as graphs and tables were used to present data. <b>Rural</b> <b>settlements</b> in Otukpo are randomly distributed and may be tending towards clustering. This is indicated by an Rn index value of 0. 96 from the nearest neighbour analysis. Most of the settlements (59 %) have a distance of two to three kilometres between them. There is an inadequacy of functional facilities and poor access to services in the <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> in Otukpo. Respondents in <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> in Otukpo are faced with the risk of agricultural occupational loss (22 %), water shortages (42 %), flooding (29 %), land based conflicts (16 %), health hazards (12 %), erosion (26 %), and migration (57 %). With evidence of climate change ascertained globally including Nigeria, the study concludes that <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> in Otukpo and elsewhere are vulnerable {{to the effects of}} climate change which is evident in literature. Government should plan appropriately to optimize standard of living and provide basic functional facilities and services for <b>rural</b> <b>settlements...</b>|$|R

50|$|Since {{there is}} no formal census data {{available}} about Afghanistan {{it is hard to}} accurately identify the number of villages. Previously, it was estimated that approximately 20000 <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> or villages existed, however this was markedly increased to 42000 villages. Since field coordinators have reported that several of the villages comprise less than the minimum of 25 families required to initiate a CDC, it is estimated by the MRRD that around 28500 NSP communities would be a reasonable equivalent to <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> estimate. This approximation thus average 1 NSP community = 1.474 <b>rural</b> <b>settlements.</b> However the current average used is 1 NSP community = 1.583 <b>rural</b> <b>settlements.</b> (National Solidarity Program Website, 2010).|$|R

In a few decades Salaspils transformed from a very peaceful <b>rural</b> <b>settlement</b> to a mikroraion-style town. Due to the rapid development, Soviet authorities ordered construction of the Riga HES and Riga TEC-2. The dam created a massive reservoir that flooded monuments of Salaspils ancient history.

25|$|The city {{is located}} in a Daco-Roman area and {{developed}} early as a <b>rural</b> <b>settlement.</b> The first documentary attestation of Jibou dates to 1205, under the name Chybur. Among the many names Jibou bore are the titles villa (town) in 1219 and oppidum (fortified town) in 1564, which attest the importance of the locality at the time. Jibou is likely older than its first documentary attestation, given that the Roman road connecting the castra of Tihău with that of Porolissum passed through its boundary. The other component localities were noted a little later: Rona in 1338, Cuceu in 1388, Husia in 1405 and Var in 1469. The development of Jibou continued in medieval times, but suffered from Turkish invasions such as those in 1610 and 1665.|$|E
40|$|Weakened {{demographic}} potentials {{of population}} as factor of development of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements,</b> also reflect {{to changes in}} the existing network of settlements in Ljig municipality. Consequences of demographic development's negative flows can be directly perceived in transformation of settlements' structure towards population size. Concentration of population in city center, together with discharge of population in village, have caused both demographic and functional disballance within settlement network. As the result of continuing processes of depopulation and population ageing, significant changes within structure of population and households of <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> have come forth. Current changes in <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> are mutually dependant to general socio-economic development, both in <b>rural</b> <b>settlements</b> and municipality as whole. Classification of <b>rural</b> Ljig's <b>settlements</b> will be conducted according to indicators of demographic development's components, with an emphasize on the most significant population problems.

25|$|Brussels {{has grown}} from a small <b>rural</b> <b>settlement</b> on the river Senne to become an {{important}} city-region in Europe. Since the end of the Second World War, Brussels has been a major centre for international politics and has become the home of numerous international organizations, politicians, diplomats and civil servants. Brussels is the de facto capital of the European Union, as it hosts a number of principal EU institutions (the other administrative centres are Luxembourg and Strasbourg). The name Brussels is sometimes used metonymically to describe the EU and its institutions. The secretariat of the Benelux and the headquarters of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) are also located in Brussels. Today, it is classified as an Alpha global city.|$|E
25|$|This was the {{dominant}} theory until in 1966 the Danish archeologist Olaf Olsen published {{the results of}} a comprehensive study of archeological investigations in Iceland and Sweden and {{of a large number of}} the oldest Danish churches. He was not able to confirm a single case of a heathen hof underlying a Christian church, and concluded in light of this that a hof could not have been an independent building. Particularly in reference to the Hofstaðir building in Iceland (see below), he suggested the model of the temple-farm: that rather than being dedicated exclusively to religious use, the hofs were also dwellings, and that the word hof referred to the great farm in a <b>rural</b> <b>settlement,</b> at which the most powerful man also held sacrifices (blótar) and feasts.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1875), the Kuril Islands – along with their Ainu {{inhabitants}} – came under Japanese administration. A total of 83 North Kuril Ainu arrived in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky on September 18, 1877, after they decided to remain under Russian rule. They refused the offer by Russian officials to move to new reservations in the Commander Islands. Finally a deal was reached in 1881 and the Ainu decided to settle in the village of Yavin. In March 1881, the group left Petropavlovsk and started the journey towards Yavin on foot. Four months later they arrived at their new homes. Another village, Golygino, was founded later. Under Soviet rule, both the villages were forced to disband and residents were moved to the Russian-dominated Zaporozhye <b>rural</b> <b>settlement</b> in Ust-Bolsheretsky Raion. As {{a result of}} intermarriage, the three ethnic groups assimilated to form the Kamchadal community. In 1953, K. Omelchenko, the minister for the protection of military and state secrets in the USSR, banned the press from publishing any more information on the Ainu living in the USSR. This order was revoked after two decades.|$|E

25|$|In {{the colonial}} era, before 1776, {{the west was}} of high {{priority}} for settlers and politicians. The American frontier began when Jamestown, Virginia was settled by the English in 1607. In {{the earliest days of}} European settlement of the Atlantic coast, down to about 1680, the frontier was essentially any part of the interior of the continent beyond the fringe of existing settlements along the Atlantic coast. English, French, Spanish and Dutch patterns of expansion and settlement were quite different. Only a few thousand French migrated to Canada; these habitants settled in villages along the St. Lawrence River, building communities that remained stable for long stretches; they did not simply jump west the way the British did. Although French fur traders ranged widely through the Great Lakes and mid-west region they seldom settled down. French settlement was limited to a few very small villages such as Kaskaskia, Illinois as well as a larger settlement around New Orleans. Likewise, the Dutch set up fur trading posts in the Hudson River valley, followed by large grants of land to rich landowning patroons who brought in tenant farmers who created compact, permanent villages. They created a dense <b>rural</b> <b>settlement</b> in upstate New York, but they did not push westward.|$|E
25|$|The June 23 {{agreement}} {{laid down}} the modalities for the bilateral and definite ceasefire and cessation of hostilities, which would begin following the signature of the final agreement. Five days following the signature of the final agreement and following the redeployment of troops, the FARC would begin moving to 23 transitory <b>rural</b> <b>settlement</b> normalization zones (Zonas Veredales Transitorias de Normalización) and 8 encampments {{for the purposes of}} delivering their weapons to the UN mission and prepare for their reincorporation into civilian life. While the normal functioning of unarmed elected civilian authorities within these zones would not be impeded, no civilian population would be allowed to reside in the zones and access would be restricted. A 1 kilometre wide security zone, off limits to both soldiers and guerrilla, would surround each zone. The FARC would designate a group of 60 members to travel throughout the national territory in performance of tasks related to the peace agreement; likewise, within each zone, a group of 10 members of the guerrilla would travel within the municipality and department for the same reasons. The UN would collect and store all weapons received from the FARC, which would later be used to build three monuments. The guerrilla would surrender their weapons gradually in three phases over 180 days from the signature of the final agreement, and the UN mission would certify the process. The announcement offered further details about the tripartite monitoring and verification mechanism, with the international component (the UN political mission) presiding the mechanism, resolving controversies and presenting recommendations and reports about the ceasefire and surrender of weapons.|$|E
25|$|Other {{reasons for}} the decline are more {{scientific}} in nature. Climate change and trade isolation are probably also large {{reasons for the}} decline of the culture. The local subsistence base was substantially augmented by a climatic shift during the 1st century AD that reinforced the spring rains, extended the rainy season from 3 1/2 to six or seven months, vastly improved the surface and subsurface water supply, doubled the length of the growing season, and created an environment comparable to that of modern central Ethiopia-where two crops can be grown per annum without the aid of irrigation. This appears to explain how one of the marginal agricultural environments of Ethiopia was able to support the demographic base that made this far flung commercial empire possible. It may also explain why no Aksumite <b>rural</b> <b>settlement</b> expansion into the moister, more fertile, and naturally productive lands of Begemder or Lasta can be verified during the heyday of Aksumite power. As international profits from the exchange network declined, Aksum lost its ability to control its own raw material sources and that network collapsed. The already persistent environmental pressure of a large population to maintain a high level of regional food production had to be intensified. The result was a wave of soil erosion that began on a local scale c. 650 and attained catastrophic proportions after 700. Presumably complex socio-economic inputs compounded the problem. These are traditionally reflected in declining maintenance, deterioration and partial abandonment of marginal crop land, shifts to destructive pastoral exploitation, and eventual, wholesale and irreversible land degradation. This syndrome was possibly accelerated by an apparent decline in rainfall reliability beginning 730-760, with the presumed result that an abbreviated modern growing season was reestablished during the 9th century.|$|E
