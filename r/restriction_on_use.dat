5000|$|This led to [...] "an {{inevitable}} judicial reaction" [...] and the overruling of the A.B. Dick case. In Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg.

[...] In that case, {{the owner of a}} patent on film projection equipment attempted to prevent competitors from selling film for use in the patented equipment by attaching to the projectors it sold a notice purporting to condition use of the machine on exclusive use of its unpatented film. Relying upon the rule that the scope of a patent [...] "must be limited to the invention described in the claims,Motion Picture Patents, the Court held that the attempted <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of unpatented supplies was improper because it expanded the patent monopoly beyond the scope of the claims and the patent law.|$|E
50|$|Subchapter III 16 U.S.C § 3921 - 3923 {{established}} the National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan, Federal Acquisition, and <b>Restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>Use</b> of Eminent Domain in Acquisitions. The {{establishment of the}} National Wetlands Priority Conservation Plan section 3921 was {{to be carried out}} by the Secretary. The plan was to outline the types of wetlands and the interests in wetlands on a region-by-regions basis that were to be considered for purchase by both Federal and State. Continual revisions and reviews of the plan were also to be carried out by the Secretary with the consultation of Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Agriculture, and {{the chief executive officer of}} each State. Several factors were to be considered with the establishment of the plan. The Secretary was to consider the remaining types of wetlands that existed at the time of European settlement, the rate at which current and future losses of the respective types of wetlands, and the types of wetlands that made contributions to all wildlife which includes threatened and endangered species, migratory birds, resident species, sport and commercial fisheries, quantity and quality of surface water and ground water, flood control, outdoor recreation, and other appropriate areas of concern which the Secretary deems appropriate.|$|E
5000|$|As a free solubized aqueous ion, {{gadolinium}} (III) {{is somewhat}} toxic, but was {{generally regarded as}} safe when administered as a chelated compound. In animals the free Gd (III) ion exhibits a 100-200 mg/kg 50% lethal dose, but the LD50 is increased by a factor of 100 when Gd (III) is chelated, so that its toxicity becomes comparable to iodinated X-ray contrast compounds. The chelating carrier molecule for Gd for MRI contrast use can be classified by whether they are macro-cyclic or have linear geometry and whether they are ionic or not. Cyclical ionic Gd(III) compounds are considered the least likely to release the Gd(III) ion, and hence the safest. However, the use of some Gd(III) chelates in persons with renal disease was linked to a rare but severe complication, nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy, also known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). This systemic disease resembles scleromyxedema and to some extent scleroderma. It may occur months after contrast has been injected. Patients with poorer renal function are more at risk for NSF, with dialysis patients being more at risk than patients with renal insufficiency. After several years of controversy during which up to 100 Danish patients have been gadolinium poisoned (and some died) after use of the contrast agent Omniscan, it was admitted by the Norwegian medical company Nycomed that they were aware of some dangers of using gadolinium-based agents for their product. At present, NSF has been linked to the use of four gadolinium-containing MRI contrast agents. The World Health Organization issued a <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of several gadolinium contrast agents in November 2009 stating that [...] "High-risk gadolinium-containing contrast agents (Optimark, Omniscan, Magnevist, Magnegita and Gado-MRT ratiopharm) are contraindicated in patients with severe kidney problems, in patients who are scheduled for or have recently received a liver transplant, and in newborn babies up to four weeks of age." ...|$|E

30|$|For EC, the {{threshold}} limit of 3  dS/m is selected because according to Table  1, for EC above 3  dS/m, there is severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> {{of water for}} irrigation while for EC values below 3  dS/m, there is no (where EC is below 0.7  dS/m) and a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> SAR of irrigation water {{except for a few}} locations is below 6, so under this situation according to Ayers and Westcot (1994) if EC is below 0.3  dS/m, there is a severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> As EC of groundwater is above 0.5  dS/m, there is no severe <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> Also for SAR between 0 and 3, in about 90  % of study area, EC of groundwater is above 0.7  dS/m and therefore there is no <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use.</b> For SAR between 3 and 6, where EC is above 1.2  dS/m, there is no restriction and where EC is between 0.3 and 1.2  dS/m, there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> (Ayers and Westcot 1994). Therefore, we used a threshold limit of 3 for SAR. For both Na+ and Cl−, a critical limit of 3  meq/L is considered for producing probability maps. According to Ayers and Westcot (1994) there is a slight to moderate <b>restriction</b> <b>on</b> <b>use</b> of irrigation water with Na+ and Cl− above 3  meq/L for sprinkler irrigation. So the probability maps of exceeding 3 dS/m, 3, 3  meq/L and 3 are produced for EC, Cl−, Na + and SAR, respectively.|$|E
