The X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy (XPS) results demonstrate that the surface composition is approximately 24 at- % Rh and 76 % Pt. The cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical quartz crystal (EQCN) results for the alloy were associated, for platinum, to the well known profile in acidic medium. For Rh, on the alloy, the generation of <b>rhodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> species (Rh(OH) 3 and RhO(OH) 3) was measured. During the successive oxidation-reduction cycles the mass returns to its original value, indicating the reversibility of the processes. It was not observed rhodium dissolution during the cycling. The 76 / 24 at % Pt-Rh alloy presented singular electrocatalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation, which started at more negative potentials compared to pure Pt (70 mV). During the sweep towards more negative potentials...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to obtain a high purity rhodium, the quality of min 99. 95 % Rh, from {{different}} raw materials which containing PGMs. Different chemical methods {{was used to remove}} traces of other base metals and precious metals from acid solutions of rhodium. Purified acid solution of rhodium (H 3 RhCl 6) was treated in two ways: 1. Reduction of rhodium-hydrazine hydrate was performed in the basic conditions 2. Rhodium from rhodium acids was translated into <b>rhodium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> and this in rhodium sulfate. Elemental rhodium, the rhodium sulfate, was obtained by electrolytic deposition on a titanium cathode, using two previously activated titanium anodes. This paper presents a technological scheme of obtaining high purity rhodium from rhodium acid solution, containing impurities of non-precious and precious metals (Pt and Pd). Also, the paper describes the preparation of titanium anodes for electrolysis. Based on the experimental work optimal parameters of the process of electrolytic deposition of high purity rhodium, were determined...|$|E
40|$|Current {{interest}} in converting organometallic processes from organic to aqueous media motivated this research {{to evaluate the}} scope of organometallic reactions and thermodynamic parameters for rhodium porphyrin species in water. Rhodium porphyrins activate an array of substrate such as H 2, CO, and CH 4 in hydrocarbon media to form rhodium hydride, rhodium formyl and rhodium methyl complexes. This thesis {{was to determine if}} comparable substrate reactions occur in aqueous solution and focused on reactivity and equilibrium thermodynamic studies of water soluble rhodium porphyrin species in the + 1, + 2, and + 3 oxidation states including rhodium hydride, <b>rhodium</b> <b>hydroxide,</b> and rhodium (II) dimer complexes with H 2, CO, aldehydes, ketones, and olefins. ^ Water soluble porphyrin rhodium complexes including rhodium tetra (p-sulfonato phenyl) porphyrin ((TSPP) Rh) and rhodium tetra (3, 5 -sulfonato mesityl) porphyrin ((TMPS) Rh) derivative applied in this research were prepared by sulfonation of tetra phenyl porphyrin (H 2 TPP) and tetra mesityl porphyrin (H 2 TMP). ^ Aqueous solutions of rhodium (III) tetra (p-sulfonatophenyl) porphyrin ((TSPP) Rb(III)) complexes react with dihydrogen to produce equilibrium distributions between six rhodium species including rhodium hydride ([(TSPP) Rh-D(D 2 O) ]- 4), rhodium(I) ([(TSPP) RhI(D 2 O) ]- 5), and rhodium (II) dimer ([(TSPP) RhII(D 2 O) ] 2 - 8) complexes. Equilibrium thermodynamic studies (298 K) for this system establish the quantitative relationships that define the distribution of species in aqueous solution {{as a function of the}} dihydrogen and hydrogen ion concentrations through direct measurement of five equilibrium constants along with dissociation energies of D 2 O and dihydrogen in water. Each of these types of rhodium porphyrin species including Rh(I), Rh(II), Rb(III), Rh-H, and Rh-OH functions as a precursor for a group of organometallic substrate reactions. ^ The second part of this dissertation describes a new developed living radical polymerization method, referred to as radical interchange polymerization (RIP). Low-polydispersity homopolymers and block copolymers of acrylates are produced at relatively fast rates when an azo radical source generates organic radicals and organo-cobalt complexes guide the polymerization through a radical interchange polymerization (RIP).

40|$|The unique {{reactivity}} that hard/soft-acid/base mismatched metal hydroxide complexes {{are capable}} of makes this elusive class of highly reactive organometallic complexes very interesting. The stabilisation of <b>rhodium</b> and iridium <b>hydroxide</b> bonds using electron rich N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands has enabled us to examine their rich chemistry and proved to be very rewarding. A general method was established for the preparation {{of a family of}} Rh(I) -NHC hydroxide complexes (four members), which proved to be highly active promoters of the conjugate addition of arylboronic acids to α,β-unsaturated ketones, achieving TONs and TOFs of 100, 000 and 6, 600 h⁻¹ respectively. In addition, we have studied the activity of Rh(I) -NHC hydroxides in catalysing the hydrosilylation and dehydrogenative silylation of terminal alkenes. The two competing reactions were studied under the same conditions and a scope for each transformation with good selectivity is presented. The scope of metal hydroxides was extended to include Ir(I) -NHC hydroxides (six members). Reactivity of this motif towards a wide range of organic substrates has been explored, undergoing reaction with arylboronic acids to form Ir(I) -aryl complexes and reacting with silanes to form Ir(I) -siloxides. The Ir(I) -hydroxide is able to deprotonate an array of O-H and N-H bonds to give new Ir(I) -alkoxides and Ir(I) -amides. In addition, C-H activation of a range of sp-, sp²- and sp³-hybridised carbon centres has been explored, delivering Ir(I) -alkyl complexes under very mild conditions, with the generation of H₂O as the sole by-product. Subsequently, we have examined the insertion of CO₂ into a number of Ir(I) -O and Ir(I) -N bonds, leading to Ir(I) -carbonates and Ir(I) -carbamates, respectively. In the case of reaction between CO₂ and Ir(I) -hydroxide, a fascinating [Ir(I) ₂-(µ-κ¹O:κ²O,O-CO₃) ] complex was obtained under extremely mild conditions. This reaction has been studied in detail using kinetic and theoretical methods to calculate activation parameters and elucidate the insertion and concomitant dimerisation mechanism. In addition, we have utilised a series of methods for the preparation of a range of interesting fluorinated Rh(I) -NHC and Ir(I) -NHC complexes; bearing fluoride, bifluoride and trifluoromethyl groups. We disclose the first iridium bifluoride complexes and briefly discuss the relationship between these and the fluoride species in solution. We also report the first Ir(I) -NHC and Rh(I) -NHC trifluoromethyl complexes...|$|R
40|$|Development of new {{mechanistic}} {{strategies and}} catalyst materials that activate substrates like CO, H 2, CH 4, C 2 H 4, O 2, CH 3 OH, and {{water for the}} conversion of carbon monoxide, alkanes, and alkenes to organic oxygenates are central objectives encompassed by this thesis. Thermodynamic database for a wide scope of organo-metal transformations {{in a range of}} reaction media including benzene, water, and methanol has been continuously established in this thesis study. ^ Rhodium(II) tetramesitylporphyrin reacts as metalloradical {{with a wide variety of}} substrates to give diamagnetic products. Aliphatic C-H bonds are the preferred targets for activation by rhodium(II) porphyrins because of the steric effect of bulky porphyrin ligands. In the reaction, concerted C-H activation occurs through a four-centered transition state (Rh· [...] -CR 3 [...] -H [...] -·Rh) where two rhodium radicals work corporately to break the C-H bond. For methanol molecules which have both C-H and O-H bond, selective C-H and O-H activations have been achieved by simple adjustment on the reaction conditions. At low methanol concentrations ([CH 3 OH] 3 ̆c 0. 1 M), two Rh(II) radicals accomplish the C-H activation to form equal amount of Rh-CH 2 OH and Rh-H. At high methanol concentrations ([CH 3 OH] 3 ̆e 0. 5 M), methanol acts as donor ligand to induce the disproportionation of rhodium(II) to form rhodium(III) bismethanol cationic complex and rhodium(I) monomethanol anionic complex. Fast proton transfer occurs between these two species to form the neutral (CH 3 OH) Rh-OCH 3 and (CH 3 OH) Rh-H species as the O-H activation products. Upon standing, these products are slowly converted to C-H activation products (CH 3 OH) Rh-CH 2 OH and (CH 3 OH) Rh-H that are more thermodynamically stable. Thermodynamic measurements on the equilibrium between rhodium(II), rhodium hydride, rhodium methoxide, and rhodium hydroxymethyl complexes predict approximate Rh-OCH 3 bond dissociation enthalpy. ^ Both rhodium(III) aqueous and methanol solutions react with dihydrogen to produce rhodium hydride ([(TSPP) Rh-D(D 2 O) ]− 4, [(TSPP) Rh-D(CD 3 OD) ]− 4) which is in equilibrium with the rhodium(I) anion ([(TSPP) Rh 1 (D 2 O) ] − 5, [(TSPP) Rh 1 (CD 3 OD) ]− 5). Each of these rhodium porphyrin species functions as a precursor for a group of organometallic substrate reactions. Equilibrium thermodynamics have been investigated for these reactions, including the reactions of <b>rhodium</b> <b>hydroxide</b> and methoxide with olefins to produce β-hydroxyalkyl and β-methoxyalkyl complexes, reactions of rhodium hydride and olefins to produce rhodium alkyl complexes, and reactions of rhodium hydride with CO to produce rhodium formyl (Rh-CHO) complexes. ^ One of my research areas is the design and synthesis of diporphyrin ligands that form dimetal complexes capable of preorganizing transition states for substrate reactions that involve two metal centers. Dirhodium dimetalloradical diporphyrin complexes are observed to manifest large rate increases over mono-metalloradical activation reactions of hydrogen, methane, and other small molecule substrates. Therefore, in this study, new strategies for catalytic conversion of carbon monoxide to organic molecules have developed. ^ This dissertation also describes the mechanistic study on cobalt porphyrin mediated living radical polymerization of vinyl acetate. Formation of organo-cobalt complexes from cobalt(II) metalloradical during the induction period prior to polymerization involves both hydrogen abstraction from initiator radical by cobalt(II) radical followed by cobalt hydride addition to olefins, and coupling of cobalt(II) radical with monomer-based organic radicals. Fast radical exchanges among organo-cobalt complexes provide the control for producing large polymers with low-polydispersity. Associative mechanism has been identified as the low-energy pathway for radical exchange between vinyl acetate radicals and vinyl acetate-cobalt complexes. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) ...|$|E
