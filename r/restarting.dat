5|$|Lester and his alien ally cannot sustain any damage, and {{the game}} ends {{immediately}} if either of them is struck by a projectile or comes in contact with an animal or an environmental hazard. However, the game uses numerous checkpoints enabling the player to keep <b>restarting</b> at the last point indefinitely.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{investigate}} the <b>restarted</b> Krylov subspace methods, as typified by the GMRES(m) method and the FOM(m) method, for solving non-Hermitian linear systems. We have recently {{focused on the}} <b>restart</b> of the GMRES(m) method and proposed {{the extension of the}} GMRES(m) method based on the error equations. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to apply the extension to other <b>restarted</b> Krylov subspace methods, and propose a specific <b>restart</b> technique for the <b>restarted</b> Krylov subspace method. The specific <b>restart</b> technique is named as a Look-Back-type <b>restart,</b> and is based on an implicit residual polynomial reconstruction via the initial guess. The comparison analysis based on the residual polynomials and some numerical experiments indicate that the Look-Back-type <b>restart</b> achieves more efficient convergence results than the traditional <b>restarted</b> Krylov subspace methods.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a supervisory control theory based offline method for calculating <b>restart</b> {{states in a}} manufacturing control system. Given these precalculated <b>restart</b> states, an operator can be given correct instructions for how to resynchronize the control system and the manufacturing resources during the online <b>restart</b> process. The proposed method enables <b>restart</b> after unforeseen errors. It is assumed that the control system is modeled by operations and that possible operation sequences emerge through dependencies between the operations. The paper shows how reexecution requirements may {{be included in the}} calculation to obtain a correct behavior for the <b>restarted</b> system. In addition, it is shown how to filter out <b>restart</b> states that require less effort for the operator during the online <b>restart,</b> and how to adapt the nominal production to always enable <b>restart</b> in desired <b>restart</b> states...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{describe}} {{experiments in the}} application of dynamic <b>restarts</b> used in heuristic satisfiability algorithms.

40|$|Abstract—As {{failure rate}} keeps on {{increasing}} in large systems, applications running atop <b>restart</b> {{more frequently than}} ever. Existing research on checkpoint/restart mainly focuses on optimizing checkpoint operation, without paying {{much attention to the}} <b>restart</b> operation. As a result, application <b>restart</b> latency maybe substantial, which greatly threatens system dependability and performance. To attack the <b>restart</b> latency problem, in this paper, we present FREM, a fast <b>restart</b> mechanism for general checkpoint/restart protocols. By dynamically tracking the process data accesses after each checkpoint, FREM masks <b>restart</b> latency by overlapping application recovery with the retrieval of its checkpoint image. We have implemented FREM as a prototype system and tested it under Linux environments. Extensive experiments with real applications demonstrate that it can effectively reduce <b>restart</b> latency by over 50 percent on average, as compared to the conventional <b>restart</b> mechanisms.

5|$|Crash {{starts the}} game with four lives. The length of each of Crash's lives is tied to his health meter, which {{decreases}} whenever Crash is damaged from enemy attacks or falls down a bottomless pit. The player can replenish Crash's health meter by instructing Crash to eat Wumpa Fruit. Each time the health meter is fully depleted, Crash loses a life. However, the player can win an additional life for Crash by collecting 25,000 units of the magical substance Mojo or by collecting a rare type of Golden Wumpa Fruit. After the last life is lost, the player can continue playing by <b>restarting</b> the current episode.|$|E

The Mérens also benefited from a new surge in popularity in riding horses, and between 1975 and 1985 its population rebounded, leading the breeding program to be considered an example for the conservation of rare breeds.
