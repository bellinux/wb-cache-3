40|$|Objective The {{concepts}} and associated analyses of mediation <b>and</b> <b>moderation</b> {{are important to}} the field of psychology. Although pediatric psychologists frequently incorporate mediation <b>and</b> <b>moderation</b> in their theo-ries and empirical research, on few occasions have we integrated mediation <b>and</b> <b>moderation.</b> In this article, conceptual reasons for integrating mediation <b>and</b> <b>moderation</b> are offered. Method We illustrate a model that integrates mediation <b>and</b> <b>moderation.</b> Results In our illustration, the strength of an indirect or a mediating effect varied as a function of a moderating variable. Conclusions Clinical implications of the integration of mediation <b>and</b> <b>moderation</b> are discussed, as is the potential of integrated models to advance research programs in pediatric psychology.

While pointing out the shortcomings of Windschuttle's interpretations, Johnson and McFarlane credit him with giving the historical profession a much-needed shake-up regarding the use and misuse of documentary evidence, on the exten of frontier violence in colonial Van Diemen's Land in particular. Their own careful evaluations of the empirical record are exemplary, recounted in clear, straightforward and unembellished prose...|$|E

He noted that sometimes educators need to use restraint in emergency situations, where there is a risk that a child will injure himself or others and nothing else will work to prevent the immediate danger.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to provide insight on Youth Care Workers perception of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion as interventive techniques and if the use or non-uses of those techniques affect the workers job satisfaction. The study used 29 respondents, ages 22 to 42 both male and female in which some used <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion techniques and the others did not. To obtain the findings, comparative analyses of several variables were observed such as; workers perceived satisfaction with their job, workers job satisfaction, workers perception of <b>restraints,</b> <b>and</b> workers perception of seclusion. In addition it is exploratory in that the results will provide important baseline information regarding Youth Care Workers perception of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion as interventive strategies among adolescents in residential treatment facilities. A self-administered questionnaire was given to Youth Care Workers that work at a facility that uses <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion techniques and facility that does not use <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion techniques. The questionnaire consisted of forty-three questions that addressed Youth Care Workers perception of restraint, seclusion, job satisfaction and level ofjob satisfaction. The study hypothesis stated that there would be a significant difference between Youth Care Workers perception of the use <b>and</b> non-use of <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion as interventive strategies among adolescents in residential treatment facilities and the effects of the use or non-use on job satisfaction. This study hypothesis was rejected because the results revealed that according to the responses of the respondents, there was no significant difference in the Youth Care Workers perception of restraints, perception of seclusion, perception of job satisfaction or level of job satisfaction. Due to the small sample of respondents, a significant difference was difficult to establish. However, there is room for further research regarding <b>restraint</b> <b>and</b> seclusion and the effects these interventive techniques may have on job satisfaction...|$|R
