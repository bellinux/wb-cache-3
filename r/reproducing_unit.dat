Multiple {{regression}} models for reproductivity active (RA) female mice show bioenergetic parameters to be functions of total live {{weight of the}} <b>reproducing</b> <b>unit</b> and reproductive day but not related to litter size or daily weight gain. 2.

40|$|Speciation via {{interspecific}} hybrids is {{very rare}} in animals, as compared to plants. Whereas most plants overcome the problem of meiosis between different chromosome sets by tetraploidization, animal hybrids often escape hybrid sterility by clonal reproduction. This comes {{at the expense of}} genetic diversity and the ability to purge deleterious mutations. However, here we show that all-hybrid populations of diploid (LR) and triploid (LLR and LRR) water frogs (Pelophylax esculentus) have secondarily acquired sexual reproduction. First, in a crossing experiment analyzed with microsatellite markers, triploid hybrids of both sexes and genotypes (LLR and LRR) recombined their homospecific genomes. Second, the great majority of natural populations investigated had low multilocus linkage isequilibrium, indicating a high recombination rate. As predicted from mating system models, the L genome had constant, low levels of linkage disequilibrium, whereas linkage disequilibrium in th e R genome showed a significant reduction with increasing proportion of recombining triploids.

40|$|Masonry may be {{considered}} macroscopically as a periodic two-phase material. The possible occurrence of cracking {{in each of the}} phases leads to a complex mechanical behaviour. Most existing macroscopic models defined for such materials are phenomenological and either isotropic or orthotropic. In this paper, a scalar damage model is used in a mesoscopic study to assess the need for incorporating non-orthotropic induced anisotropy in macrocopic models. Based on unit cell computations and homogenization techniques under a plane stress assumption, it is shown that scalar damage meso-models allow to obtain realistic in-plane damage patterns encountered in experiments. Results suggest that at the meso-scale, it is possible to use a scalar damage model for the individual phases which naturally leads to an overall anisotropy evolution. This evolving macroscopic anisotropy is illustrated using a numerical homogenization procedure to identify the degraded stiffness associated to the obtained damage patterns. It is shown that the characteristic anisotropic shape of experimental failure envelopes for masonry may be <b>reproduced</b> by <b>unit</b> cell computations, as far as in-plane failure mechanisms are concerned. © 2004 Elsevier SAS.

Foi utilizada a história "Urubu e as pombas", proposta por Golden revisada e adaptada por Antunes e col, que deveria ser reproduzida após a narrativa realizada pela avaliadora. A análise do desempenho lingüístico foi dividida em quantitativa através do número total de sentenças (nodos) reproduzidas (14 no total), e qualitativa pelo reconto dos temas centrais da história e a ocorrência de distorções (as alterações que podem ocorrer no reconto da história). RESULTADOS: foi verificado que o número de sentenças reproduzidas foi sete, em média. No entanto, é interessante notar que nem todos os nodos considerados tema central foram recontados. CONCLUSÃO: os resultados sugerem que a habilidade de memória textual evidenciada nos índices de reprodução das orações não foi suficiente para garantir compreensão da história, dada ausência de alguns nodos dos temas centrais no reconto realizado pelos sujeitos.

40|$|AimThe {{unsupervised}} {{nature of}} traditional numerical {{methods used to}} classify vegetation hinders the development of comprehensive vegetation classification systems. Each new unsupervised classification yields partitions that are partly inconsistent with previous classifications and change group membership for some sites. In contrast, supervised methods account for previously established vegetation units, but cannot define new ones. Therefore, we introduce the concept of semi-supervised classification to community ecology and vegetation science. Semi-supervised classification formally <b>reproduces</b> the existing <b>units</b> in a supervised mode and simultaneously identifies new units among unassigned sites in an unsupervised mode. We discuss the concept of semi-supervised clustering, introduce semi-supervised variants of two clustering algorithms that produce groups with crisp boundaries, k-means and partitioning around medoids (PAM), provide a free software tool to perform these classifications and demonstrate the advantages using example data sets of vegetation plots. MethodsSemi-supervised methods use a priori information about group membership for some sites to define centroids (k-means) or medoids (PAM) of site groups that represent previously established vegetation units. They identify these groups in a species hyperspace and assign new sites to them. At the same time, they search for a user-defined number of new groups. We compared the unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised methods using {{an example of a}} forest vegetation data set that was previously classified using expert knowledge, and assessed how well these methods <b>reproduced</b> vegetation <b>units</b> defined by experts. Then we compared supervised and semi-supervised methods in a task when a grassland vegetation classification established in one country was extended to two neighbouring countries. Results and conclusionsExample analyses of vegetation plot data sets demonstrated that semi-supervised variants of k-means and PAM are extremely valuable tools for extending existing vegetation classifications while preserving previously defined vegetation units. They can be used both for identifying so far unrecognized vegetation types in the regions where a vegetation classification already exists and for extending a vegetation classification from a particular region to neighbouring regions with partly identical but partly different vegetation types. Both k-means and PAM provide site groups with crisp boundaries, which makes them a simpler alternative to fuzzy clustering methods...|$|R

This result has an immediate practical application: it shows that {{if we have a}} standard unit of length (i. e., a stick with two marks on it) that enables us to check whether a given distance is equal to 1 unit or not, then we can (in principle) measure an arbitrary distance. This unit-distance preserving theorem proves that such measurement is potentially possible. However, the actual procedures that stem from the existing proofs are too lengthy and thus, not practically feasible (for example, according to these procedures, we need at least 10 6 applications of the original standard to determine distance with accuracy 10 − 6). In this paper, we describe a feasible procedure that measures an arbitrary distance using a given standard unit of length. 1. IT IS NECESSARY For many decades, a standard of length (a standard meter) was a distance between two marks on a stick stored in a special location. Nowadays, a standard length is defined as a distance between the two consequent wavepeaks of a certain electromagnetic wave (actually, a meter is defined as a certian multiple of this distance).

Stormwater runoff quality is estimated based on an accumulation-washoff process, where release of pollutants {{is assumed to be}} proportional to the rainfall intensity and the pollutant mass available in the catchment. The treatment unit submodel is based on a serial tanks approach. The number of tanks is defined according of the hydraulic residence time and the geometric characteristics of the treatment <b>unit,</b> <b>reproducing</b> the hydraulic behaviour of the unit (including hydraulic short-circuiting). The fate of TSS and Cu is modelled by including the following processes among a larger range of processes represented in the STUMP model: settling and resuspension of sediments (TSS) and adsorption/desorption of Cu to/from TSS, thus representing Cu as both a particle-bound and a dissolved species. Settling and resuspension is modelled in a lumped manner for the whole treatment unit focusing solely on TSS and the sorbed Cu. Particle size distribution, effects of wind and temperature on resuspension, etc. are not considered by the model. The catchment submodel provides total pollutant loads and concentrations, while the treatment unit distinguishes between the dissolved and the particle-bound fractions.

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to develop computational approaches to the modelling of zinc and copper paddlewheel complexes both in isolation and when incorporated into metal organic frameworks (MOFs). We considered both ‘ab initio’ and empirical force field methods based mainly on DFT and ligand field molecular mechanics (LFMM) respectively. A new all-atom first-principles force field (FF) is constructed for the bimetallic, four-bladed zinc paddlewheel (ZPW) motif. Zinc-ligand interactions are described via Morse functions and the angular geometry at the metal centres is modelled with a pure ligand-ligand repulsion term. The ZPW-FF is principally based on 21 DFT-optimized model systems of general formula ZnPR. nL, where ZnP is the base Zn 2 (O 2 CR) 4 unit, R=H, CH 3 or CF 3, L=NH 3, pyridine, or water and n = 0, 1 or 2. It correctly generates the distorted tetrahedral coordination of the uncapped [Zn 2 (O 2 CR) 4] species in their ground {{states as well as}} giving reasonable structures and energies for the higher symmetry D 4 h transition state conformations. The zinc-ligand Morse function reference distance, r 0, is further refined against some experimental complexes located in the Cambridge Structural Database and this FF is applied to pore models of the flexible MOF [Zn(bdc) 2 (dabco) ]n and also used to assess the system under water vapour. A single pore model <b>reproduces</b> the <b>unit</b> cell of the evacuated MOF system while a 3 × 3 grid model is necessary to provide good agreement with the observed pronounced structural changes upon adsorption of either dimethylformamide or benzene. The ZPW-FF is also applied to 2 D and 3 D crystal systems of MOF- 2 which comprises Zn(bdc) (H 2 O). (dmf) building units and provides good results. In the second part of this thesis, our density functional theory calculations on four-bladed copper paddlewheel (CPW) systems [Cu 2 (O 2 CR) 4 L 2] reveal a change in ground state with increasing Cu–L bond strength. For L = N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), the Jahn–Teller axis switches from parallel to orthogonal to the Cu–Cu vector and the copper coordination geometry becomes highly flexible. While the calculated dimer/monomer equilibrium for isolated complexes slightly favours monomers, the preformed paddlewheel units embedded in many metal organic frameworks are potential targets for developing novel materials. Therefore, the preliminary LFMM parameters for constructing a generic CPW-FF are reported. However, a definitive version of the CPW-FF remains a task for the future...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} aspects of the process of care that might help explain the improved outcomes associated with stroke units. Three different care settings for stroke patients, an elderly care unit and general medical ward in an inner-city teaching hospital and a stroke unit in another teaching hospital in the same city, were compared using non-participant observational methods. Nurses on the stroke unit and general medical ward usually engaged in standardised and functional interaction with patients, while nurses on the elderly care unit were observed to adopt a more personal and attentive approach with patients. Rehabilitation nursing was rarely observed on the stroke unit, never on the general medical ward but always on the elderly care unit. There was evidence of effective communication between nurses and therapists on the elderly care unit but this was not observed on the stroke unit. On the elderly care unit the team appeared divided, with therapists and nurses on one side and medicine on the other, while on the stroke unit the divide was between doctors and therapists on one hand and nurses the other. On the general medical ward there was no team working. The observed lack of rehabilitation nursing, nurses' disengagement from the team and nurses' observed lack of warmth towards patients on the stroke unit were all surprising findings. Further research needs to examine whether such findings would be <b>reproduced</b> in stroke <b>units</b> elsewhere. If so, it might be that the better outcomes achieved on stroke units are despite rather than because of the nursing they receive there. Stroke units Rehabilitation Nursing...|$|R
