50|$|During the First World War {{business}} flourished {{and created}} the basis for expansion of the fleet. Vesterhavet contracted for 19 new ships in the period 1914-1916. After the war in 1918, Vesterhavet sold their fleet and closed down business, but reentered the shipping industry in March 1919 without a single ship {{but a lot of}} cash. At the end of 1924, the fleet had 28 new vessels. Besides coal and lumber trade, in 1932 J. Lauritzen officially entered the fruit trade and rebuilt one of their steamers as a <b>reefer</b> <b>vessel.</b> In 1935, J. Lauritzen took delivery of their first reefer, African Reefer. By 1940, J.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn the {{proposed}} paper numerical {{calculations are carried}} out using two versions of a three-dimensional, time-domain panel method developed by the group of Prof. P. Sclavounos at MIT, i. e. the linear code SWAN 2, enabling optionally {{the use of the}} instantaneous non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces and the fully non-linear SWAN 4. The analytical results are compared with experimental results for three hull forms with increasing geometrical complexity, the Series 60, a <b>reefer</b> <b>vessel</b> with stern bulb and a modern fast ROPAX hull form with hollow bottom in the stern region. The details of the geometrical modeling of the hull forms are discussed. In addition, since SWAN 4 does not support transom sterns, only the two versions of SWAN 2 were evaluated over experimental results for the parent hull form of the NTUA double-chine, wide-transom, high-speed monohull series. The effect of speed on the numerical predictions was investigated. It is concluded that both versions of SWAN 2 the linear and the one with the non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces provide a more robust tool for prediction of the dynamic response of the vessels than the non-linear SWAN 4 code. In general, their results are close to what was expected on the basis of experience. Furthermore, the use of the option of non-linear Froude-Krylov and hydrostatic forces is beneficial for the accuracy of the predictions. The content of the paper is based on the Diploma thesis of the second author, supervised by the first one and further refined by the third one...|$|E

An example of trend-setting technological innovation was {{the development of the}} Family Class <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> delivered from Danyard (Aalborg and Frederikshavn Shipyards) in 1990-91. A reefer-industrial cluster had gradually evolved within the Lauritzen Group, which included construction at Danyard of state-of-the-art <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> equipped with advanced cooling machinery produced by Sabro Refrigeration, ownership of <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> by J.

40|$|This {{study has}} been made {{with the purpose of}} trying to attain the {{competitiveness}} between container carriers and specialised reefers in offering door-door services for perishable cargo. In order to achieve a full scale picture of the investigated cost chains a number of different analyses and calculations have been performed regarding the door-door cost chain. Two key trades where the NLC group is currently operating have been chosen as basis for this comparison. Still, the intention in this {{study has been}} to find the general benefits/disadvantages regard the chosen mode of transportation, which can be applicable to any trade using a certain mode. A model has therefore been constructed based on earlier studies conducted within the NLC group, relevant shipping theory and new information gathered during interviews and questionnaires. This model computes a comparison between the shipper and carrier looking at the total door-door cost. An indication on the competition in the trade is hereby attained. However most importantly is that the comparison generates an overview of the economical conditions in the trade, i. e. are the trades theoretically making money. The results from this study show that there is a margin in most trades between the cost to produce the service, i. e. carrier cost and the shipper cost. This is only natural however the troubles come from comparing the margins between the container and specialised <b>reefer</b> <b>vessel.</b> These result shows that the container margin in certain trades is almost {{three times the size of}} the specialised reefers looking at competing trades. This does not only indicate bigger revenue but also makes for a buffer towards market fluctuations. Results from the study also show the importance in taking full control of the entire cost chain and not to be governed by strong importers controlling the end of the chain. This is especially true looking at pallets transported under deck where the haulage activity plays a critical scale of balance role, with the possibility of breaking the entire cost chain. A backhaul cost model has also been constructed in order to find the possible effects which backhaul can play on the total round voyage cost. These results show that all investigated backhaul cargo covers the additional cost for the backhaul operation, hence giving contribution to container and ship repositioning. However only live cargo shipped in operating 40 `RHC can pay the full cost for the round voyage. Looking at the general competitiveness between the different transport modes this study does not produce any final conclusions. A tendency can however be noticed towards container lines under the right circumstances tend to produce the door-door service at a lower cost compared to the specialised reefer...|$|E

The company was allowed to resume shipbuilding already in 1949. Production could soon be continued, starting with repair of ships and locomotives and the construction of fishing vessels. Soon later the shipbuilding programme was enlarged and various types of ships were offered to the market as container/multi purpose cargo ships, passenger liners, passenger-cargo vessels, roll-on/roll-off ships, LNG and LPG tankers, supply ships, special-purpose ships, <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> and others. End of the 1970th the BV became world leader in container delivered capacity and in innovative container ship design.|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of trim on the fuel consumption of reefer ships have been investigated. The project {{have been carried}} out at NYKCool AB, a ship operator of <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels.</b>   In the speed range 17 - 19 knots and deadweight percentage of approximately 70 % the smallest calculated resistance is obtained for bow trims which are between - 1 m and - 2 m depending on the speed.    Stored voyage data from the reefer ships shows {{that the majority of the}} voyages are made with positive trims. The data also shows that the mean fuel consumption in ton per hour is smallest for the even keel condition in comparison with aft (positive) trims. The conclusions have been made for deadweight conditions of 70 - 80 % DWT. Savings of bunker are in the order of magnitude of 3 - 4 % and have been seen from the data analysis.    The average fuel consumption in traffic is approximately 37 tons of heavy fuel oil per day. Due to factors such as different docking schedules the ships have different performance. The tests shows a correlation between the fuel consumption and optimal trims. Bow trims are always more favorable from a saving perspective.    The largest bow trim that was possible and which ensured proper propeller immersion was approximately - 1 m and was achieved by planning the stowage together with burning bunker from the fuel tanks in the right order.    The stability is affected due to less buoyancy in the bow area compared to the mid ship sections, but always above the minimum criteria of GM 0 <o 0. 15 m with enough margins. GM 0 remains in the interval of 2 - 3 m depending on the deadweight percentage and trim condition.    Economical savings will be seen over longer periods of time by operating the <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> with the optimal trims. ...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{emissions}} from commercial shipping are currently unregulated, but nevertheless {{they are a}} subject of intense scrutiny by the world shipping community. According to the Kyoto protocol, definite measures to reduce CO 2 emissions are {{necessary in order to}} curb the projected growth of greenhouse gases (GHG) worldwide. Shipping has thus far escaped being included in the Kyoto global emissions reduction target for CO 2 and other GHGs, {{but it is clear that}} the time of non-regulation is rapidly approaching its end, and measures to curb future CO 2 growth are being sought with a high sense of urgency. Various analyses of many aspects of the problem have been and are being carried out and a spectrum of measures are being contemplated. It is clear that a reliable emissions inventory is essential for both scientists and policy-makers in order to formulate and evaluate the implementation of relevant regulations. To contribute to this debate and possibly complement other studies on the subject, the authors of this paper have conducted their own analysis on emissions of the world fleet database and can herein present some preliminary results of the emissions statistics of the following major ship types: bulk carriers, crude oil tankers, container vessels, product/chemical carriers, LNG carriers, LPG carriers, <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels,</b> Ro-Ro vessels and general cargo ships.

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] South African plum industry is an important supplier of fresh fruit to the northern hemisphere from December to April. Extensive use is made of a dual- temperature shipping regime, which {{is a form of}} intermittent warming, in order to limit the occurrence of chilling-related internal defects like gel breakdown (GB) and internal browning (IB). The perception in industry is that use of the 12 m integral reefer containers leads to more quality defects than are experienced in conventional <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> using the same temperature regimes. It was hypothesised that there are significant temperature variances in the integral reefers and three pallets of Sapphire plums were therefore wired with thermocouples to log pulp and air temperatures during commercial shipping to the United Kingdom. Results indicated that the delivery air temperature (DAT) was very close to the set point, and that the container therefore had the refrigeration capacity to maintain the DAT within acceptable tole- rances. Air temperatures within the pallets, however, varied significantly, with peaks of up to 12 °C at a set point of 7. 5 °C. The fruit pulp temperatures showed similar deviations. As expected, fruit in the pallet closest to the doors showed the slowest reaction to changes in temperature, and those in the pallet closest to the cooling unit, the most rapid. Fruit in the 4 th layer on the pallet, closest {{to the base of the}} pallet, reacted fastest to changes in set point, and fruit in the 10 th layer, close to the middle of the pallet, generally reacted the slowest. All fruit were deemed ‘ripe and ready to eat’ upon arrival, and no IB ir GB were found. Mention was made, however, of significant levels of shrivel, which may have been aggravated by the fairly low relative humidity in the container. Further trials are underway to investigate the relationship between fruit quality and the temperature gradients in reefer containers, using cultivars with differing metabolic rates...|$|R
40|$|This {{bachelor}} thesis {{strives to}} perspicuously answer what an ice strengthening {{of two different}} existing <b>reefer</b> <b>vessels</b> might mean for operations in the Baltic Sea and illustrate what factors a shipping company needs to consider when initiating such a project. The main purpose is to provide an information basis facilitating the communication between different parties in the shipping industry. The existing specialized reefer fleet is old and few new ships are being built or commissioned. At the same time, there is an increasing demand of shipping perishables to St. Petersburg, inciting the strengthening of existing ships to meet market demands. The methodology used in this report is a compilation of selective literature research (primarily providing qualitative, secondary data) and a comparative study in which the secondary data is applied on the reefer classes Crown and Family. While other classification societies are mentioned, this report focuses on Lloyd’s Register and the ice classes 1 D and 1 C, suitable for very light and light ice conditions and sailing in convoy with icebreaker assistance. Although ice class 1 C is designated for tougher ice conditions than 1 D, they share many strengthening requirements. Most substantially, the requirements for 1 C concerning the forward region and steering arrangements, stipulated by the Swedish Maritime Administration (Swedish: Sjöfartsverket), are also applicable to 1 D. The main differences between these classes originate from the expanse of waterline and structural strengthening in the ice belt, propeller and screw shaft requirements and lastly, the requirements concerning machinery layout and engine output. The results comprise of estimations regarding minimum engine output, ice belt cost, thickness and spread, bow strengthening and a commentary on the remaining requirements that have been omitted in the analysis. Conclusively, depending on the shipping company’s predefined operational and financial goals, the initial choice of class notation should be evident {{based on the information}} presented in this report. If, for example, the Crown class is intended for shipping perishable goods to St. Petersburg all year round, the incentives for converting the ship to ice class 1 C are strong, due to a higher reliability in ETA. The effects of added weight and higher expenses could however advocate ice class 1 D. Similarly, should the Family class only sail sporadically to St. Petersburg, it could be more financially sensible to convert the ship to ice class 1 D...|$|R

40|$|This is an {{exploratory}} study seeking {{to gain a}} better understanding of seasonality at the Port of Napier container terminal. It seeks to explore the motives behind the actions of the pipfruit exporters, and analyse the impact seasonal reefer (refrigerated containers) volumes have on terminal operations. The case study method is employed because it reflects the interpretive assumptions adopted for the study, and has the tools to analyse the qualitative and quantitative data collected. The study revealed the exporters source most of their fruit from their own and leased orchards. The guaranteed volumes justify the investments made in fruit handling facilities. The balance of their fruit comes from contract growers where the exporters seek to establish long term relationships to minimise supply uncertainty. The exporters look to using their own fruit handling facilities, before passing any fruit to third parties, because of the greater flexibility afforded by prioritising shipments in their own facilities. The exporters have invested in information systems that have automated most of the previously manual processes, and assist with managing the complexity of compliance, improving visibility in their operations, and satisfying the traceability requirements of their customers. The exporters have retail programs in place with customers in their traditional markets (US and Europe) that enable them to manage their work load for the entire season. The exporters have increasingly directed marketing efforts to the fixed price markets in mostly Asia, the Middle East and Russia, because the upfront payments, shorter transit times and fixed prices, reduce the risk of serving the markets. The fixed price sales are very much on short notice and present unique challenges on logistic systems, as the emphasis is on expediting shipments to get the best prices. The success of exclusive varieties and licensed orchards give the exporters much hope, particularly with the latter, as they are able to maintain fresh supplies all year round. The exporters select shipping lines on the basis of transit times and port calls but are in reality, at the mercy of the powerful shipping lines They have to base their marketing plans on the schedules of the lines. Chartering offers a way around the rigid schedules of the shipping lines, though only one exporter currently exercises this option. The impact of the pipfruit export season in the terminal is evident on its impact on several aspects of terminal operations. Container vessel calls increase, as shipping lines deploy ‘extra loaders’ to complement their regular services to deal with the added cargo volumes. Vessel exchange times lengthen to reflect the increase in containers exchanged. Reefer capacity utilisation rises well above the average, though reefer dwell times decrease to reflect the pressure exporters work under during the season that almost reduces them to packing <b>reefers</b> just-in-time for <b>vessels.</b> The number of rehandles rises to mimic the added container volumes as the terminal employs strategies to cope with the scarcity of reefer space...|$|R
