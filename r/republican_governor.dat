30|$|Note that <b>republican</b> <b>governors</b> show an {{even larger}} multi-term effect than the average multi-term governor. This {{may be related to}} two factors. First, <b>republican</b> <b>governors</b> may be in states {{in which there is a}} greater distaste for state {{spending}} and tax increases. This means that the governor has few options if he or she wishes to expand social protection. Second, <b>republican</b> <b>governors</b> career concerns may be such that higher state deficits are more detrimental than greater usage of federal programs. As a result, <b>republican</b> <b>governors</b> appear to be quite willing to use federal public welfare programs.|$|R

Johnson received 4.4 million votes (roughly 3.3% of the total vote), which is most for a third party presidential candidate since 1996 and the highest national vote share for a Libertarian candidate in history.|$|E
5|$|Lazio faced {{a unique}} {{tactical}} problem campaigning upstate. The major issue {{there was the}} persistently weak local economy, which Lazio hoped to link to his opponent's husband's tenure in office. Attacks {{on the state of}} the upstate economy were frequently interpreted as criticism of incumbent <b>Republican</b> <b>governor</b> George Pataki, however, limiting the effect of this line of attack.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{was indicted}} as an {{accessory}} in {{the assassination of}} Goebel. He fled to Indianapolis, where the governor refused to extradite him.

50|$|The state's {{trend towards}} the Democratic Party {{and away from}} the Republican Party can be seen in state elections.

5|$|A poorly educated but {{politically}} astute lawyer, Taylor began {{climbing the}} political ladder by holding local offices {{in his native}} Butler County. Though he was a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic state, divisions in the majority party resulted in his election as Attorney General of Kentucky on a ticket with the Commonwealth's first <b>Republican</b> <b>governor,</b> William O. Bradley. Four years later, Taylor was elected in 1899 to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|Bradley's {{election}} in 1895 had {{marked the first}} time in Kentucky's history that the Commonwealth had elected a <b>Republican</b> <b>governor.</b> Angry Democrats, who had controlled the governorship since the fall of the Whig Party, sought to regain what they had lost. Bitter divisions in the party led to a contentious convention that nominated William Goebel as the party candidate. A faction of the Democratic Party held a second nominating convention and chose former governor John Y. Brown as their nominee.|$|E

5|$|Going {{into the}} 2010 state elections, the Minnesota {{government}} faced an approximately $5 billion budget shortfall {{in the coming}} 2011–2013 biennium, {{left over from the}} outgoing administration of <b>Republican</b> <b>Governor</b> Tim Pawlenty. The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending, and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. In the gubernatorial election, former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state's highest earners.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, Willson {{sought the}} Republican gubernatorial nomination. He had {{the backing of}} William O.

5|$|In the 1895 gubernatorial election, Kentucky elected its first-ever <b>Republican</b> <b>governor,</b> William O. Bradley.

Pettit, to secure victory in the general election by just under 9,000 votes. This election marked the beginning of nearly thirty years of true, two-party competition in Kentucky politics.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} of Republican president William McKinley in 1896 deepened the Democrats' resolve {{to oppose the}} <b>Republican</b> <b>governor</b> and his allies.
