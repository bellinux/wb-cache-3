5|$|The Lorentz {{group and}} its Lie algebra have the {{complete}} reducibility property. This means that every representation reduces to a direct sum of irreducible representations. The <b>reducible</b> representations will therefore not be discussed.|$|E
5|$|This {{quadtree}} {{method is}} more general, as it works even for clustering methods {{that are not}} <b>reducible.</b> However, the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm matches its time and space bounds while using simpler data structures.|$|E
5|$|Non-reductive Physicalism is {{the view}} that mental {{properties}} form a separate ontological class to physical properties: mental states (such as qualia) are not <b>reducible</b> to physical states. The ontological stance towards qualia {{in the case of}} non-reductive physicalism does not imply that qualia are causally inert; this is what distinguishes it from epiphenomenalism.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be <b>reducible</b> to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|In {{the theory}} of cluster analysis, the nearest-neighbor chain {{algorithm}} is an algorithm that can speed up several methods for agglomerative hierarchical clustering. These are methods that take a collection of points as input, and create a hierarchy of clusters of points by repeatedly merging pairs of smaller clusters to form larger clusters. The clustering methods that the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm {{can be used for}} include Ward's method, complete-linkage clustering, and single-linkage clustering; these all work by repeatedly merging the closest two clusters but use different definitions of the distance between clusters. The cluster distances for which the nearest-neighbor chain algorithm works are called <b>reducible</b> and are characterized by a simple inequality among certain cluster distances.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{elements}} to Durkheim's theory {{of knowledge is}} his concept of représentations collectives (collective representations), which is outlined in The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life. Représentations collectives are the symbols and images that come to represent the ideas, beliefs, and values elaborated by a collectivity and are not <b>reducible</b> to individual constituents. They can include words, slogans, ideas, or any number of material items that {{can serve as a}} symbol, such as a cross, a rock, a temple, a feather etc. As Durkheim elaborates, représentations collectives are created through intense social interaction and are products of collective activity. As such these representations have the particular, and somewhat contradictory, aspect that they exist externally to the individual (since they are created and controlled not by the individual but by society as a whole), and yet simultaneously within each individual of the society (by virtue of that individual's participation within society).|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout iron rod passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or <b>reducible</b> to, physical phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Every set is Turing <b>reducible</b> {{to its own}} Turing jump, but the Turing jump of a set {{is never}} Turing <b>reducible</b> to the {{original}} set.|$|E
25|$|A reduced diagram is a knot diagram {{in which}} there are no <b>reducible</b> {{crossings}} (also nugatory or removable crossings), or in which all of the <b>reducible</b> crossings have been removed.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, {{it is not}} {{possible}} to prove the cycle double cover conjecture using a finite set of <b>reducible</b> configurations. Every <b>reducible</b> configuration contains a cycle, so for every finite set S of <b>reducible</b> configurations there is a number γ such that all configurations in the set contain a cycle of length at most γ. However, there exist snarks with arbitrarily high girth, that is, with arbitrarily high bounds on the length of their shortest cycle. A snark G with girth greater than γ cannot contain any of the configurations in the set S, so the reductions in S are not strong enough to rule out the possibility that G might be a minimal counterexample.|$|E
25|$|Via this mapping class group {{interpretation}} of braids, each braid may {{be classified as}} periodic, <b>reducible</b> or pseudo-Anosov.|$|E
25|$|A <b>reducible</b> {{configuration}} is {{an arrangement}} of countries that cannot occur in a minimal counterexample. If a map contains a <b>reducible</b> configuration, then the map {{can be reduced to}} a smaller map. This smaller map has the condition that if it can be colored with four colors, then the original map can also. This implies that if the original map cannot be colored with four colors the smaller map can't either and so the original map is not minimal.|$|E
25|$|A {{subspace}} W of V that is invariant {{under the}} group action {{is called a}} subrepresentation. If V has exactly two subrepresentations, namely the zero-dimensional subspace and V itself, then the representation {{is said to be}} irreducible; if it has a proper subrepresentation of nonzero dimension, the representation is said to be <b>reducible.</b> The representation of dimension zero is considered to be neither <b>reducible</b> nor irreducible, just like the number 1 is considered to be neither composite nor prime.|$|E

25|$|As long as some {{member of}} the {{unavoidable}} set is not <b>reducible,</b> the discharging procedure is modified to eliminate it (while introducing other configurations). Appel and Haken's final discharging procedure was extremely complex and, together {{with a description of}} the resulting unavoidable configuration set, filled a 400-page volume, but the configurations it generated could be checked mechanically to be <b>reducible.</b> Verifying the volume describing the unavoidable configuration set itself was done by peer review {{over a period of several}} years.|$|E
25|$|A {{representation}} is called semisimple or completely <b>reducible,</b> {{if it can}} be written as a direct sum of irreducible representations. This is analogue to the definition of the semisimple algebra.|$|E
25|$|One-one reducibility: A is one-one <b>reducible</b> (or 1-reducible) to B {{if there}} is a total computable {{injective}} function f such that each n is in A if and only if f(n) is in B.|$|E
25|$|LiH is less {{reactive}} {{with water}} than Li {{and thus is}} a much less powerful reducing agent for water, alcohols, and other media containing <b>reducible</b> solutes. This is true for all the binary saline hydrides.|$|E
25|$|If W has {{exactly two}} subrepresentations, namely the trivial {{subspace}} {0} and W itself, then the representation {{is said to}} be irreducible; if W has a proper nontrivial subrepresentation, the representation {{is said to be}} <b>reducible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-reductive {{physical}}ism is {{the idea}} that while mental states are physical they are not <b>reducible</b> to physical properties, in that an ontological distinction lies in the differences between the properties of mind and matter. According to non-reductive physicalism all mental states are causally <b>reducible</b> to physical states where mental properties map to physical properties and vice versa. A prominent form of non-reductive physicalism called anomalous monism was first proposed by Donald Davidson in his 1970 paper Mental events, where it is claimed that mental events are identical with physical events, and that the mental is anomalous, i.e. under their mental descriptions these mental events are not regulated by strict physical laws.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{methods for}} solving quadratic equations were geometric. Babylonian cuneiform tablets contain problems <b>reducible</b> to solving quadratic equations. The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, {{dating back to}} the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation.|$|E
25|$|In a {{subsequent}} paper Bestvina and Handel applied the train track techniques {{to obtain an}} effective proof of Thurston's classification of homeomorphisms of compact surfaces (with or without boundary) which says that every such homeomorphism is, up to isotopy, is either <b>reducible,</b> of finite order or pseudo-anosov.|$|E
25|$|Specific syndromes of {{selective}} factors can create {{situations in which}} groups are selected because they display group properties which are selected-for. Many common examples of group traits are <b>reducible</b> to individual traits, however. Selection of these traits is thus more simply explained as selection of individual traits.|$|E
25|$|Logicism {{is one of}} {{the schools}} of thought in the {{philosophy}} of mathematics, putting forth the theory that mathematics is an extension of logic and therefore some or all mathematics is <b>reducible</b> to logic. Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead championed this theory fathered by Gottlob Frege.|$|E
25|$|The planar graphs and {{the apex}} graphs are linklessly embeddable, {{as are the}} graphs {{obtained}} by Y-Δ transforms from these graphs. The YΔY <b>reducible</b> graphs are the graphs that {{can be reduced to}} a single vertex by Y-Δ transforms, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices; they are also minor-closed, and include all planar graphs. However, there exist linkless graphs that are not YΔY <b>reducible,</b> such as the apex graph formed by connecting an apex vertex to every degree-three vertex of a rhombic dodecahedron. There also exist linkless graphs that cannot be transformed into an apex graph by Y-Δ transforms, removal of isolated vertices and degree-one vertices, and compression of degree-two vertices: for instance, the ten-vertex crown graph has a linkless embedding, but cannot be transformed into an apex graph in this way.|$|E
25|$|The graph {{automorphism}} {{problem is}} polynomial-time many-one <b>reducible</b> to the graph isomorphism problem, but the converse reduction is unknown. By contrast, hardness is known when the automorphisms are constrained {{in a certain}} fashion; for instance, determining {{the existence of a}} fixed-point-free automorphism (an automorphism that fixes no vertex) is NP-complete, and the problem of counting such automorphisms is #P-complete.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{chemistry}} {{was developed}} by Justus von Liebig and others, following Friedrich Wöhler's synthesis of urea which proved that living organisms were, in theory, <b>reducible</b> to chemistry. Other crucial 19th century advances were; an understanding of valence bonding (Edward Frankland in 1852) {{and the application of}} thermodynamics to chemistry (J. W. Gibbs and Svante Arrhenius in the 1870s).|$|E
25|$|Several {{problems}} in computational complexity and geometric graph theory may {{be classified as}} complete for the existential theory of the reals. That is, every problem in the existential theory of the reals has a polynomial-time many-one reduction to an instance {{of one of these}} problems, and in turn these problems are <b>reducible</b> to the existential theory of the reals.|$|E
25|$|Case work {{functions}} {{as an exercise}} in framing problems so as to identify potentially significant elements, relations, and interfaces. Case work underscores questions of how such material should be presented. Case work can indicate strengths and weaknesses in the venues in which inquiry is initiated and formed. Casework, therefore, is an essential aspect of inquiry neither <b>reducible</b> to theory nor an end-in-itself.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} {{attack on}} the cycle double cover problem would be {{to show that there}} cannot exist a minimum counterexample, by proving that any graph contains a <b>reducible</b> configuration, a subgraph that can be replaced by a smaller subgraph {{in a way that would}} preserve the existence or nonexistence of a cycle double cover. For instance, if a cubic graph contains a triangle, a Δ-Y transform will replace the triangle by a single vertex; any cycle double cover of the smaller graph can be extended back to a cycle double cover of the original cubic graph. Therefore, a minimal counterexample to the cycle double cover conjecture must be a triangle-free graph, ruling out some snarks such as Tietze's graph which contain triangles. Through computer searches, it is known that every cycle of length 11 or less in a cubic graph forms a <b>reducible</b> configuration, and therefore that any minimal counterexample to the cycle double cover conjecture must have girth at least 12.|$|E
25|$|Cartesian dualism and Popper's three {{worlds are}} {{two forms of}} what is called {{epistemological}} pluralism, that is the notion that different epistemological methodologies are necessary to attain a full description of the world. Other forms of epistemological pluralist dualism include psychophysical parallelism and epiphenomenalism. Epistemological pluralism is one view in which the mind-body problem is not <b>reducible</b> to the concepts of the natural sciences.|$|E
25|$|The term redex, {{short for}} <b>reducible</b> expression, refers to subterms {{that can be}} reduced {{by one of the}} {{reduction}} rules. For example, (λx.M) N is a beta-redex in expressing the substitution of N for x in M; if x is not free in M, λx.M x is also an eta-redex. The expression to which a redex reduces is called its reduct; using the previous example, the reducts of these expressions are respectively M and M.|$|E
25|$|One of Democritus' {{arguments}} {{in support of}} atomism was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam. His idea was that small changes in atomic-scale properties would lead to big changes in the aggregate behavior. Others believed that matter is inherently continuous, not atomic, and that the large-scale properties of matter are not <b>reducible</b> to basic atomic properties.|$|E
25|$|Logicism is {{the thesis}} that {{mathematics}} is <b>reducible</b> to logic, and hence nothing but a part of logic. Logicists hold that mathematics can be known a priori, but suggest that our knowledge of mathematics {{is just part of}} our knowledge of logic in general, and is thus analytic, not requiring any special faculty of mathematical intuition. In this view, logic is the proper foundation of mathematics, and all mathematical statements are necessary logical truths.|$|E
25|$|Vaisheshika {{school is}} known for its {{insights}} in naturalism, and it is a form of atomism in natural philosophy. It postulated that all objects in the physical universe are <b>reducible</b> to paramāṇu (atoms), and one's experiences are derived from the interplay of substance (a function of atoms, their number and their spatial arrangements), quality, activity, commonness, particularity and inherence. According to Vaiśeṣika school, knowledge and liberation were achievable by complete understanding of the world of experience.|$|E
