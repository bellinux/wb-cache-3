Fluctuations of H at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the <b>rescaled</b> system has more modes. If the system is <b>rescaled</b> in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{the digital}} cinema {{postproduction}} chain, image <b>rescaling</b> {{serves as a}} core function. The quality of <b>rescaling</b> is critical to maintaining the visual impact of a digital film at play-out. In the EU funded project IP-RACINE, it is required to address color distortion, artifacts and image blur in fractional <b>rescaling</b> within 1 pixel for a typical image of resolution 2 K. To this end, we proposed a hybrid warping framework for fractional image <b>rescaling</b> that not only unifies the two dominant image <b>rescaling</b> methods, namely discrete mapping and interpolation, but also offers greater flexibility in preserve properties of image contents. Within this framework we have devised a novel <b>rescaling</b> method based on constrained seam carving. Compared with unconstrained seam carving[1], the new method can preserve global geometry of image contents and confine nonlinear distortion to be within ± 1 pixel; compared with nearest neighbour mapping, it generates less visible artifacts; compared with interpolation methods, it can maintain color fidelity and sharpness in the original image...|$|R

25|$|If {{the system}} is <b>rescaled,</b> the change in {{conductivity}} depends only on the distance between a fixed saddle point and the conductivity. The scaling behavior near the quantum Hall transitions is then universal and different quantum Hall samples will give the same scaling results. But, by studying the quantum Hall transitions theoretically, many different systems that are all in different universality classes {{have been found to}} share a super-universal fixed point structure. This means that many different systems that are all in different universality classes still share the same fixed point structure. They all have stable topological sectors and also share other super-universal features. That these features are super-universal is due to the fundamental nature of the vacuum angle that governs the scaling behavior of the systems. The topological vacuum angle can be constructed in any quantum field theory but only under the right circumstances can its features be observed. The vacuum angle also appears in quantum chromodynamics and might have been important {{in the formation of the}} early universe.|$|E

40|$|<b>Rescaling</b> is {{possibly}} the most popular approach to cost-sensitive learning. This ap-proach works by <b>rescaling</b> the classes according to their costs, {{and it can be}} realized in different ways, e. g., weighting or sampling the training examples in proportion to their costs, moving the decision boundary of classifiers faraway from high-cost classes in pro-portion to costs, etc. This approach is very effective in dealing with two-class problems, yet some studies showed that it is often not so helpful on multi-class problems. In this paper, we try to explore why the <b>rescaling</b> approach is often helpless on multi-class prob-lems. Our analysis discloses that the <b>rescaling</b> approach works well when the costs are consistent, while directly applying it to multi-class problems with inconsistent costs may not be a good choice. Based on this recognition, we advocate that before applying the <b>rescaling</b> approach, the consistency of the costs should be examined at first. If the costs are consistent, the <b>rescaling</b> approach can be conducted directly; otherwise it is better to apply <b>rescaling</b> after decomposing the multi-class problem into a series of two-class problems. An empirical study involving twenty multi-class data sets and seven types of cost-sensitive learners validates the effectiveness of our proposal.

40|$|A popular {{approach}} to cost-sensitive learning is to <b>rescale</b> the classes {{according to their}} misclassification costs.
