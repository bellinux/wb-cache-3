50|$|VeriSign's naming {{services}} division {{dates back to}} 1993 when Network Solutions was awarded a contract by the National Science Foundation to manage and operate the civilian side of the Internet's domain name registrations. Network Solutions was the sole registrar {{for all of the}} Internet's non governmental generic top-level domains until 1998 when ICANN was established and the new system of competitive registrars was implemented. As a result of these new policies, Network Solutions divided itself into two divisions. The NSI <b>Registry</b> <b>division</b> was established to manage the authoritative registries that the company would still operate and was separated from the customer-facing registrar business that would have to compete with other registrars. The divisions were even geographically split with the NSI Registry moving from the corporate headquarters in Herndon, Virginia, to nearby Dulles, Virginia. In 2000, VeriSign purchased Network Solutions taking over its role in the Internet DNS. The NSI <b>Registry</b> <b>division</b> eventually became VeriSign's naming {{services division}} while the remainder of Network Solutions was later sold by VeriSign in 2003 to Pivotal Equity Group.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this health {{consultation}} is to discuss public health issues that may result from being a participant in, or spectator of, indoor motorized sporting events and to make health recommendations to protect persons involved in these activities. The specific case illustrating this discussion concerns the non-fatal poisoning of several children by carbon monoxide (CO). The children had been participating in motocross events at an indoor track that was formerly a golf dome. The local health department and a state legislator asked the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH) for a public health opinion regarding the case. MDCH conducted this health consultation for the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) under a cooperative agreement. ATSDR conducts public health activities (assessments/consultations, advisories, education) at sites of environmental contamination and concern. ATSDR is primarily an advisory agency. Therefore, its reports usually identify what actions are appropriate to be undertaken by the regulatory agency overseeing the site, other responsible parties, or the research or education divisions of ATSDR. As such, ATSDR recommendations may not encompass all types {{of federal and state}} requirements from a regulatory perspective. Thus, the purpose of a health consultation is not to evaluate or confirm regulatory compliance but to determine if any potentially harmful exposures are occurring or may occur in the future.

25|$|The United States Centers For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{performed}} {{indoor air}} quality testing for formaldehyde {{in some of the}} units. On February 14, 2008, the CDC announced that potentially hazardous levels of formaldehyde were found in many of the travel trailers and manufactured homes provided by the agency. The CDC's preliminary evaluation of a scientifically established random sample of 519 travel trailers and manufactured homes tested between December 21, 2007, and January 23, 2008 (2+ years after manufacture), showed average levels of formaldehyde in all units of about 0.077 parts per million (ppm). Long-term exposure to levels in this range can be linked to an increased risk of cancer and, at levels above this range, there can also be a risk of respiratory illness. These levels are higher than expected in indoor air, where levels are commonly in the range of 0.01–0.02 ppm, and are higher than the Agency for Toxic Substance Disease <b>Registry</b> (ATSDR, <b>division</b> of the CDC) Minimal Risk Level (MRL) of 0.008 ppm.

40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} with the objective of examining descriptive epidemiological characteristics of malignant ‍ocular tumours in Karachi (1998 - 2002). The data for two hundred and forty two ocular malignancies registered at ‍the Karachi Cancer <b>Registry</b> for Karachi <b>Division</b> during a 5 -year period, from January 1 st 1998 to December 31 st ‍ 2002 were analysed. The age standardized incidence rate (ASIR) was 0. 5 / 100, 000 in males and 0. 4 / 100, 000 in females. ‍The gender ratio (M:F) was 1. 3. The mean age was 34. 8 years (95 % CI 30. 1; 39. 6) in males and 34. 5 years (95 % CI ‍ 28. 0; 40. 9) in females. A fourth of the malignancies were childhood tumours. The most common childhood malignancies ‍were retinoblastomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, whereas the most common adult malignancies were conjunctival ‍squamous cell carcinomas and melanomas. Approximately 97. 0 % of the tumours were histologically confirmed. ‍The majority (62. 5 %) presented as low-grade (grade 1) lesions, and were localized to the eye (50 %) at the time of ‍diagnosis. The annual incidence rates remained stable during this period. ‍The crucial importance of ocular malignancies is the high 5 -year survival rates, associated disability following ‍unilateral or bilateral enucleation and the implications as preventable components of ‘Cancer Control Programs’. ‍This article provides demographic statistics, which could be useful for the foundation, establishment and monitoring ‍of a component of an effective cancer control program, the risk factors of ocular malignancies being well established. ‍It is recommended that public health education to prevent ultraviolet light related ocular malignancies, information ‍on preventative sun protection behavior, legislation for occupation related ocular cancers and genetic counseling for ‍familial retinoblastoma should be essential primary components of all National Cancer Control Programs even in ‍apparently low risk countries. In the long-term perspective, these efforts should further reduce the incidence - ‍meanwhile stabilization of incidence rates could be achieved.

40|$|ObjectiveThe optimal {{method of}} {{operative}} management of complex branch renal artery aneurysms (RAAs) remains unclear, with recent reports predominantly espousing endovascular and ex vivo repair. We {{sought to determine}} the long-term outcome of RAA repair performed with autogenous in situ techniques. MethodsThis was a cohort study of patients undergoing surgical repair of RAAs identified from our prospective vascular <b>division</b> <b>registry</b> (1984 - 2009). ResultsTwenty-six RAAs were repaired in 24 patients (17 women, 7 men; mean age, 52 ± 16 years). Mean size was 2. 3 ± 0. 7 cm (range, 0. 7 - 4. 0 cm). Twenty RAAs were repaired based on size and six for hypertension alone. Multiple RAAs were present in 13 patients (54 %). Associated conditions included hypertension in 24 (100 %), fibromuscular dysplasia in 6 (25 %), coexistent renal artery stenosis in 6 (25 %), and aortic aneurysm in 3 (12. 5 %). Reconstruction of first- or second-order branches was required in 25 RAAs (96 %). In situ techniques were used in 22 repairs and included resection combined with autogenous vein bypass and interposition in 11, primary anastomosis to conjoined outflow vessels in 3, and aortic reimplantation in 2. Aneurysmorrhaphy was combined with vein patch angioplasty in 6, exclusion in 2, tailored primary closure in 1, and autogenous bypass in 1. Four patients underwent ex vivo reconstruction. Perioperative mortality was 0 % and morbidity was 11. 5 %, including one nephrectomy during ex vivo repair for immediate thrombosis. Renal function was preserved (preoperative creatinine, 0. 94 ± 0. 3 vs postoperative creatinine 1. 06 ± 0. 4 mg/dL; P =. 11). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) control improved after operation: preoperative SBP 142 ± 18 vs postoperative SBP 130 ± 15 mm Hg (P =. 007) and preoperative DBP 86 ± 14 vs postoperative DBP 78 ± 10 mm Hg (P =. 01). Long-term patency was evaluated in 18 reconstructions (69 %) by duplex imaging or contrast radiography at an average long-term follow-up of 99 months (range, 1 - 300 months) and was 94 %. Five-year freedom from rupture and survival by the Kaplan-Meier method was 100 %. ConclusionIn situ techniques allow repair of complex RAAs involving branch vessels with minimal morbidity, improved blood pressure control, and maintenance of renal function. This operative approach further provides excellent long-term patency and survival in this relatively young patient population...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inherited retinal {{diseases}} (IRDs) {{constitute a}} group of clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions which cause degeneration of retinal photoreceptor cells and result in visual impairment. Characterisation of the genetic basis of IRD is not only beneficial for the affected families, but also contributes towards understanding of the disease pathobiology. Investigations into the molecular basis of IRDs have been ongoing in South Africa (SA) for over 30 years, however the evaluation of reported genetic mutations has yielded low returns in certain populations. Indigenous southern Africans comprise a unique population group with distinct genetic diversity, providing a valuable resource for genetic discoveries; nonetheless, this population remains largely underrepresented in genomic studies. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to characterise the underlying genetic mutations in a cohort of indigenous African IRD patients. Methods: The IRD <b>registry</b> in the <b>Division</b> of Human Genetics (University of Cape Town) was reviewed for causative mutations. Subsequently, upon identifying a mutation underlying Usher Syndrome in two indigenous African patients, an assay was designed to screen for this mutation in probands with different IRDs (n= 170) and controls (n= 51), and haplotype analysis was performed on mutation-positive individuals. The registry review additionally served to identify a suitable cohort for the application of next generation sequencing (NGS) technology. Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on genomic DNA samples from 56 individuals from 16 families. The WES data analysis strategy involved prioritisation of variants in reported and candidate IRD genes. Rare, co-segregating, pathogenic, exonic or splice variants were validated by Sanger sequencing. Custom TaqMan assays were designed to screen seven mutations, identified by WES, in 193 unrelated indigenous African probands with IRDs. Results: A homozygous founder mutation, c. 6377 delC in MYO 7 A, was identified in 43 % of the indigenous African patients with Usher syndrome, which is {{the most common cause of}} deaf-blindness. Targeted WES data analysis of all known IRD genes resulted in identification of the underlying genetic defects in six distinct genes (RHO, PRPF 3, PRPF 31, ABCA 4, CERKL, and PDE 6 B) in six families. Taqman screening revealed four additional probands with identical homozygous mutations in CERKL and PDE 6 B. An X-linked gene (RP 2) mutation was subsequently identified in an affected family with semi-dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Supplementary analysis of the X-linked RPGR ORF 15 mutation hotspot (not adequately covered by WES) identified two mutations in three families. A novel IRD gene, IDH 3 A, was found in one family by analysis of 22 putative candidate genes. The large number of variants in the remainder of the indigenous African exomes presented considerable challenges for identification of additional novel genes. Discussion: The results of this project have important implications for IRD molecular diagnostic services in SA. Using WES, a genetic diagnosis was obtained for ± 73 % of the indigenous African cohort, and ± 70 % of the causative mutations identified were novel. This outcome emphasises the superiority of NGS-based approaches over genotyping-based microarrays which screen for IRD mutations previously reported in other (mainly European-derived) populations. The unexpected identification of mutations in known X-linked genes in four families highlighted key considerations for IRD WES analysis. Cascade screening of mutations identified in this study, across larger cohorts of unrelated probands, revealed the genetic cause of IRD in additional cases and the number of indigenous African families in the registry with a genetic diagnosis was effectively doubled. Members of these families can now opt for diagnostic, carrier, or predictive testing of familial mutations. Finally, the information obtained from this research contributes towards a better understanding of the genetic architecture of IRDs in SA...|$|R
