Monomorium pharaonis is also notable for its complex foraging system, involving intricate trail routes maintained with several pheromones. It was the first ant species discovered to use a negative (<b>repellant)</b> pheromone. These chemicals are integral for communication in this species.|$|E

25|$|Both the {{attractive}} and repellent pheromones are utilized {{in the decision-making}} an ant must make while foraging. The repellent pheromone is especially useful in the repositioning of trails after a new food source has been introduced. It also helps prevent ants from concentrating on an undesirable trail. Thus, the <b>repellant</b> pheromone makes the pharaoh ant a particularly efficient forager. Despite their extreme importance, there is an adaptive value to using pheromones sparingly, as it streamlines communication during important decision-making situations, such as a nest migration.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{prevalence}} and devastation of ant attacks, M. drewseni {{has developed a}} way to protect themselves, but mainly their brood, from their predators. Females have a gland on their gaster that secretes a liquid; females are commonly seen rubbing their gaster along the stem of the nest. This secretion, which is spread on the stem, then, somehow prevents ants from climbing on the stem to reach the nest and the brood. In experiments, when ants {{come in contact with}} this secretion, they have a violent reaction and retract away from the secretion, suggesting that it is a chemical <b>repellant</b> of sorts. In addition, the structure of the nest itself and the morphology of the wasp seems to support a co-evolution of this defensive mechanism. The length of the stem separates the nest from any place that an ant would be. In addition, the elongated first abdominal piece of the wasp serves to allow the secretion to be spread over the whole stem, whose narrow diameter makes secretions economical. This system of defense is also very practical because it allows the female to forage and leave the brood unattended without putting them at risk. This <b>repellant</b> seems to be very effective with some ants, but not strong enough to derail army ants, as they travel in huge groups.|$|E
25|$|Loline bioactivities {{show some}} {{unexpected}} variability with variation in their concentration in grass tissues. For example, the tall fescue endophyte, N. coenophialum, {{has been associated}} with enhanced resistance to the migratory root-endoparasitic nematode, Pratylenchus scribneri. Interestingly, at low concentrations, N-formylloline serves as a chemoattractant for P. scribneri, but acts as a <b>repellant</b> at higher concentrations. However, ergot alkaloids also have repellent and immobilizing effects on P. scribneri, and an endophyte of perennial ryegrass lacking lolines, and genetically engineered to produce no ergot alkaloids, exhibits resistance to this nematode. Therefore, the relative importance of the loline and ergot alkaloids to nematode resistance remains unclear.|$|E

50|$|As seen antecedently, B. scutellaris often falls prey to Eciton raids, which, however {{infrequently}} occur, have devastating results. Unlike many {{of their}} eusocial relatives who have developed chemical defenses through self-produced ant <b>repellants,</b> which they excrete around the nest, B. scutellaris must adapt through nest evolution.|$|R
25|$|In Australia, Monomorium {{species is}} {{particularly}} successful. This fact is particularly curious {{because of the}} presence of a very aggressive ant family, Iridomyrmex, which is quite proficient at interference competition. Iridomyrmex ants are able to quickly seek out food sources and prevent other ant species from reaching them. However, unlike other ant species, Monomorium species, despite their unaggressive nature and small size, are able to thrive even in areas where Iridomyrmex dominates. This success can be attributed to their efficient foraging strategy, and their novel use of venom alkaloids, <b>repellant</b> chemical signals. With these two behaviors, Monomorium species can rapidly monopolize and defend food sources.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} other {{molecules}} {{also involved in}} the guidance of axons to and across the midline. The slit proteins have repulsive functions, as opposed to netrins, and are mediated by the transmembrane protein Robo. Axonal growth cones that are attracted to the midline by netrin/DCC signaling eventually cross the floor plate. When this occurs they lose responsiveness to netrin and become repulsed by slit/Robo signaling. This is accomplished by {{the formation of a}} DCC-Robo complex, which inhibits attractive netrin/DCC signals while allowing slit/Robo signals. Netrin also has other receptors, the UNC-5 family. The UNC5 receptors have <b>repellant</b> migratory responses to netrin binding, and have similar effects to the slit/Robo system.|$|E
25|$|Male M. flavitarsis have larger sixth, seventh, {{and eighth}} sternal glands than other wasps, {{suggesting}} {{a role in}} secretion and possible sexual attractant. Secretion is suggested because the wasps will often rub their abdomens along the nest, spreading a highly <b>repellant</b> substance to deter ants. The use of secretion is also used by males when trying to attract a female because they will rub their abdomen along the perimeter of their perching territory. Near the openings of the glands are sternal brushes, which assist in rubbing the secreted substance along the surface. Sternal brushes occur only in the M. flavitarsis of the Mischocyttarus genus.|$|E

40|$|Rhynchophorus palmarum is {{a problem}} in oil & coconut palm in Central & South America due to direct larval damage & {{vectoring}} of red ring nematode. Pheromone trapping & removal of red ring nematode infested palms are the only economically viable techniques used in the Americas used to combat palm weevil problems. Trapping is made difficult by the requirement for replacement of water & food bait in the traps. This paper reports discovery of non-repellant additives that extend the effective life of trap food bait from 2 weeks to 7 weeks. The new additives do not evaporate so that in hot weather traps remain attractive up to 7 weeks without addition of water. This paper also describes tests of <b>repellants</b> that reduce captures of Rhynchophorus palmarum in pheromone traps by over than 50 %. These <b>repellants</b> make possible push-pull strategies to improve management of palm weevils...|$|R
25|$|Polybia sericea are {{generally}} docile wasps, {{and will not}} attack other organisms unless they are stimulated. When they are attacked, however, they may chase predators up to 15 meters away from the nest. In addition they may sting and bite the predator. The magnitude of a defense response {{is proportional to the}} energetic investment by the colony in rearing individuals, and also {{to the size of the}} colony. More individuals are likely to attack a predator if there are more adults, eggs, larvae, and pupae in the nest, because the colony has already made a large investment in developing itself. Polybia sericea relies upon active defense to defend their nest from ants, whereas other species produce glandular secretions that act as ant <b>repellant</b> to deter ants from entering the nest.|$|E

2500|$|Pharaoh ants utilize 3 {{types of}} pheromones. One is a {{long-lasting}} attractive chemical {{that is used}} to build a trail network. It remains detectable even if the ants do not use the trail for several days. Pharaoh ants cease activity at night and begin each day of work at around 8am, yet parts of the trail network are identical each day. [...] The second pheromone is also attractive, but will decay to imperceptible amounts {{in a matter of minutes}} without reapplication. This pheromone is useful in marking food sources, as these are unpredictable and the colony must be able to respond to environmental changes quickly. Individuals will not waste their time on an unprofitable trail route. The third pheromone is a <b>repellant.</b> [...] Pharaoh ants were the first species found to use a negative trail pheromone. If an individual finds an unprofitable area with little food or significant danger, it will release this <b>repellant</b> pheromone, which will warn others and cause them to look elsewhere. While positive pheromones indicating lucrative foraging sites are very common in social insects, the pharaoh ant's negative pheromone is highly unusual. [...] Like the food source marker, the negative pheromone is volatile, decaying roughly two hours after being emitted. It may even be insecticidal in some cases. It is so powerful that an individual can detect it from [...] away. Pharaoh ants utilize this pheromone near forks in the trail network, and an ant that detects it will begin to walk in a zigzag manner.|$|E
40|$|Many {{failures}} of external walls made of porous buildingmaterials {{are caused by}} excessive moisture content,particularly after driving rain and under long duration ofmoist conditions. Lack of sufficient protection againstexposure conditions {{is one of the}} reasons for external wallsprematurely demonstrating failures, i. e. properties andperformance above/below critical levels. Silicon-based waterrepellants are increasingly used in order to improve theperformance of both old and new buildings. Water <b>repellants</b> areexpected to prolong the service life and improve the durabilityof wall components by preventing or minimising water ingressinto the structure and thus delaying the deteriorating effectsof the atmosphere. To date, various kinds of water repellantshave been developed. However, only limited research has beencarried out, particularly on the long-term field exposuretesting. Existing research is mainly focused on the performanceof surface treatments of concrete structures and the protectionof historical buildings built of stone, brick and wood, and isprimarily based on short-term laboratory testing. The aim ofthis research work is to study the long-term performance,degradation processes and ageing characteristics of renderedautoclaved aerated concrete (AAC) with and without waterrepellants. Investigations are carried out by physical andchemical analysis of fresh samples, samples naturally weatheredby long-term field exposure and samples artificially aged byshort-term accelerated laboratory tests. Two differentapplication of water <b>repellants</b> are employed: impregnation ofrendering surface with an aqueous product and as additive inpowder form mixed into the fresh rendering mortar. Continuousmoisture and temperature monitoring of naturally exposed testsamples are also included in the study. Wetcorr sensors andresistance-type nail electrodes are used to measure the surfacemoisture and the moisture content in the material,respectively. This thesis describes the experimental set-upand presents the results from site monitoring and laboratorytests of unexposed, naturally and artificially exposed samples(freeze-thaw and UV+water). The results from the continuousmoisture measurements are compared with the results obtainedfrom the full-scale test cabin built within the EUREKA-projectE 2116 DurAAC. The test cabin has the same basic measurementinstruments for continuous monitoring of moisture andtemperature. An attempt has been made to develop methods forlong-term performance assessment of water <b>repellants</b> to be usedin service life prediction. The combination of data obtainedfrom the field measurements with data obtained from thelaboratory tests and analysis may also meet practical needs ofthe end-users. NR 2014080...|$|R
