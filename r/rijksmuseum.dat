5|$|The Van Gogh Museum {{opened in}} the Museumplein in Amsterdam in 1973. It became the second most popular museum in the Netherlands, after the <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> {{regularly}} receiving more than 1.5million visitors a year. In 2015 it had a record 1.9million; 85 percent of the visitors come from other countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1909 the Art Association {{campaigned for}} a major retrospective, the Augustus Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition, {{to be brought to}} Indianapolis. The exhibition, also {{referred}} to as the Saint-Gaudens Memorial Exhibition of Statuary, attracted 56,000 visitors during its three-month run, well beyond the board's goal of attracting 50,000 visitors. A 1937 exhibition, Dutch Paintings of the Seventeenth Century, included loans from the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> Amsterdam. The six-week exhibition presented 65 pieces, including several Rembrandts, and was considered the beginning of the museum's rise to connoisseurship.|$|E
5|$|On {{occasion}} a Ruisdael changes hands. In 2014, Dunes by the Sea was auctioned at Christie's in New York, and realised a {{price of}} $1,805,000. Of his surviving drawings, 140 in total, the <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, Dresden's Kupferstich-Kabinett, and the Hermitage each hold significant collections. Ruisdael's rare etchings are spread across institutions. No collection holds a print {{of each of the}} thirteen etchings. Of the five unique prints, the British Museum holds two, two are in the Albertina in Vienna, and one is in Amsterdam.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's {{work was}} in {{demand in the}} Dutch Republic during his lifetime. Today it is spread across private and {{institutional}} collections around the world; the National Gallery in London, the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> in Amsterdam, and the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg hold the largest collections. Ruisdael shaped landscape painting traditions worldwide, from the English Romantics to the Barbizon school in France, and the Hudson River School in the US, and influenced generations of Dutch landscape artists.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdaels are {{scattered}} across collections globally, {{both private and}} institutional. The most notable collections are at the National Gallery in London, which holds twenty paintings; the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> in Amsterdam, which holds sixteen paintings; and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, which holds nine. In the US, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has five Ruisdaels in its collection, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in California has three.|$|E
5|$|Already in the 1880s, Muller had {{dabbled in}} {{ethnography}} and writing. On {{the basis of}} materials gathered on his journey to East Africa and South Africa in 1882/’83, he had held public lectures throughout the Netherlands and Belgium. He also published articles on his trip in Dutch magazines and newspapers, and collated these publications into a book titled Zuid-Afrika. It made him somewhat of a celebrity, {{and an expert on}} South Africa and East Africa. During his journey Muller had also collected a large number of ethnographic objects and artefacts, on which he published a richly illustrated study in 1892, together with Joh. F. Snelleman, curator of the Africa collection in the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> voor Volkenkunde (National Museum of Ethnology) in Leiden.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 the German {{zoologist}} Peter Simon Pallas formally {{described the}} bluebuck as Antilope leucophaeus. In 1853, the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck {{stated that the}} type specimen was an adult male skin now in the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in Leiden (formerly <b>Rijksmuseum</b> van Natuurlijke Historie), collected in Swellendam and present in Haarlem before 1776. It has been questioned whether this was actually the type specimen, but in 1969, the Dutch zoologists Antonius M. Husson and Lipke Holthuis selected it as the lectotype of a syntype series, as Pallas may have based his description on multiple specimens.|$|E
5|$|Two further photographs, one of {{the river}} Ciliwung in Batavia, and another of Kali Mati in Padang, are held at the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> in Amsterdam. The Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies holds {{a copy of the}} De Bussy publication, and the Leiden University Library holds 281prints, 7of which are of disputed provenance, which were donated to the Royal Dutch Geographical Society by Pieter Johannes Veth in 1891. The four extant {{collections}} of Meessen's work are considerably fewer than those of his contemporaries such as Woodbury and Page, and his oeuvre has been little studied or collected.|$|E

25|$|A {{few of his}} {{paintings}} show a certain hardening of manner and are generally thought to represent his late works. From this period come The Allegory of Faith (c. 1670; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and The Love Letter (c. 1670; <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> Amsterdam).|$|E
25|$|The Museumplein of Amsterdam — {{a spacious}} square with a pond and park {{frequently}} used for outdoor festivals and events — {{lies in the}} heart of the museum quarter in Amsterdam surrounded by the <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk and the Concertgebouw.|$|E
25|$|Catholic {{churches in}} Amsterdam have been {{constructed}} since {{the restoration of the}} episcopal hierarchy in 1853. One of the principal architects behind the city's Catholic churches, Cuypers, was also responsible for the Amsterdam Central Station and the <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> which led to a refusal of Protestant King William III to open 'that monastery'.|$|E
25|$|Gulella streptostelopsis was {{described}} by Adolph Cornelis van Bruggen in 2007 based on material (except for one specimen) obtained for the National Museum of Natural History in Leiden (Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum, formerly <b>Rijksmuseum</b> van Natuurlijke Historie) by Ms H.M. Meredith (Newquay, U.K.; formerly Malawi) and her co-workers in the period 1975-1988.|$|E
25|$|In Leiden, Dolf {{was charged}} with the {{education}} of undergraduates in Systematic Zoology. In 1969 he received his Ph.D. with the thesis '‘Studies on the land molluscs of Zululand with notes {{on the distribution of}} land molluscs in Southern Africa’'. His supervisor was Prof. Dr Leo Brongersma, director of the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> van Natuurlijke Historie.|$|E
25|$|The {{height of}} Metzinger's Neo-Impressionist work was in 1906 and 1907, {{when he and}} Delaunay painted portraits of one another in {{prominent}} rectangles of pigment. In the sky of Metzinger's Coucher de soleil no. 1, 1906–1907 (<b>Rijksmuseum</b> Kröller-Müller), is the solar disk which Delaunay was later (during his Cubist and Orphist phases) to make into a personal emblem.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} museums of Amsterdam {{are located on}} the Museumplein (Museum Square), located at the southwestern side of the <b>Rijksmuseum.</b> It {{was created in the}} last quarter of the 19th century on the grounds of the former World's fair. The northeastern part of the square is bordered by the very large <b>Rijksmuseum.</b> In front of the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> on the square itself is a long, rectangular pond. This is transformed into an ice rink in winter. The northwestern part of the square is bordered by the Van Gogh Museum, Stedelijk Museum, House of Bols Cocktail & Genever Experience and Coster Diamonds. The southwestern border of the Museum Square is the Van Baerlestraat, which is a major thoroughfare in this part of Amsterdam. The Concertgebouw is situated across this street from the square. To the southeast of the square are situated a number of large houses, one of which contains the American consulate. A parking garage can be found underneath the square, as well as a supermarket. The Museumplein is covered almost entirely with a lawn, except for the northeastern part of the square which is covered with gravel. The current appearance of the square was realised in 1999, when the square was remodelled. The square itself is the most prominent site in Amsterdam for festivals and outdoor concerts, especially in the summer. Plans were made in 2008 to remodel the square again, because many inhabitants of Amsterdam are not happy with its current appearance.|$|E
25|$|Although officially {{employed}} by the University, his actual place of work was a few minutes away at the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> van Natuurlijke Historie. This enabled him to consult the extensive library {{and to work with}} the collection of the museum. Each year he and Wenda travelled to London, to visit the Natural History Museum and meet colleagues and friends.|$|E
25|$|It {{opened in}} 1885. Its {{collection}} consists of nearly one million objects. The artist most associated with Amsterdam is Rembrandt, whose work, {{and the work}} of his pupils, is displayed in the <b>Rijksmuseum.</b> Rembrandt's masterpiece The Night Watch is one of top pieces of art of the museum. It also houses paintings from artists like Van der Helst, Vermeer, Frans Hals, Ferdinand Bol, Albert Cuyp, Jacob van Ruisdael and Paulus Potter. Aside from paintings, the collection consists of a large variety of decorative art. This ranges from Delftware to giant doll-houses from the 17th century. The architect of the gothic revival building was P.J.H. Cuypers. The museum underwent a 10-year, 375 million euro renovation starting in 2003. The full collection was reopened to the public on 13 April 2013 and the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> has established itself as the most visited museum in Amsterdam with 2.2million visitors in 2013.|$|E
25|$|The {{city has}} many open squares (plein in Dutch). The namesake {{of the city}} as the site of the {{original}} dam, Dam Square, is the main town square and has the Royal Palace and National Monument. Museumplein hosts various museums, including the <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> Van Gogh Museum, and Stedelijk Museum. Other squares include Rembrandtplein, Muntplein, Nieuwmarkt, Leidseplein, Spui, and Waterlooplein. Also, near to Amsterdam is the Nekkeveld estate conservation project.|$|E
25|$|The Amsterdam Stock Exchange, {{the oldest}} stock {{exchange}} in the world, {{is located in}} the city center. Amsterdam's main attractions, including its historic canals, the <b>Rijksmuseum,</b> the Van Gogh Museum, the Stedelijk Museum, Hermitage Amsterdam, the Anne Frank House, the Amsterdam Museum, its red-light district, and its many cannabis coffee shops draw more than 5million international visitors annually. It is also the world's most multicultural city with at least 177 nationalities represented.|$|E
25|$|Gullit {{was born}} Rudi Dil in Amsterdam to George Gullit, a Surinamese migrant {{who arrived in}} the Netherlands with Herman Rijkaard, father of Frank Rijkaard, and Ria Dil, his mistress, from the Jordaan {{district}} of Amsterdam. The family lived in one split level room {{on the top floor}} of a small apartment building. Gullit's father worked as an economics teacher at a local school, his mother as a custodian at the <b>Rijksmuseum.</b>|$|E
25|$|Among the {{institutions}} {{affiliated with the}} university are The KITLV or Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (founded in 1851), the observatory 1633; the natural history museum, with a very complete anatomical cabinet; the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> van Oudheden (National Museum of Antiquities), with specially valuable Egyptian and Indian departments; a museum of Dutch antiquities from the earliest times; and three ethnographical museums, of which the nucleus was Philipp Franz von Siebold's Japanese collections. The anatomical and pathological laboratories of the university are modern, and the museums of geology and mineralogy have been restored.|$|E
25|$|The first {{exhibition}} {{devoted to}} Bellange {{took place in}} 1931/32 at the Albertina in Vienna, followed by an American one in 1975 (Des Moines, Boston, and New York), based around the excellent collection that the Boston Museum of Fine Arts had built up over the preceding decades. In 1997 a European exhibition based on an American private collection went to the British Museum, <b>Rijksmuseum</b> Amsterdam and Statens Museum, Copenhagen, {{as well as the}} Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh. An exhibition was held in Rennes in 2001. Bellange has also featured prominently in exhibitions with a broader scope in the period, and there is now a catalogue raisonné of the prints by Nicole Walch, Die Radierungen des Jacques Bellange, Munich 1971.|$|E
25|$|The wooden lodge where Barentsz' crew {{sheltered}} {{was found}} undisturbed by Norwegian seal hunter Elling Carlsen in 1871. Making {{a sketch of}} the lodge's construction, Carlsen recorded finding two copper cooking pots, a barrel, a tool chest, clock, crowbar, flute, clothing, two empty chests, a cooking tripod {{and a number of}} pictures. Captain Gunderson landed at the site on 17 August 1875 and collected a grappling iron, two maps and a handwritten translation of Pet and Jackman's voyages. The following year, Charles L.W. Gardiner also visited the site on 29 July where he collected 112 more objects, including the message by Barentsz and Heemskerck describing their settlement to future visitors. All of these objects eventually ended up in the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> Amsterdam, after some had initially been held in The Hague.|$|E
25|$|Hendrik Brouwer's {{discovery}} of the Brouwer Route, that sailing east from the Cape of Good Hope until land was sighted and then sailing north along {{the west coast of}} Australia was a much quicker route than around the coast of the Indian Ocean, made Dutch landfalls on the west coast inevitable. The first such landfall was in 1616, when Dirk Hartog landed at Cape Inscription on what is now known as Dirk Hartog Island, off the coast of Western Australia, and left behind an inscription on a pewter plate. In 1697 the Dutch captain Willem de Vlamingh landed on the island and discovered Hartog's plate. He replaced it with one of his own, which included a copy of Hartog's inscription, and took the original plate home to Amsterdam, where it is still kept in the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|Vermeer's {{mother-in-law}} Maria Thins owned Dirck van Baburen's 1622 oil-on-canvas The Procuress (or {{a copy of}} it), {{which appears}} {{in the background of}} two of Vermeer's paintings. The same subject was also painted by Vermeer. Almost all of Vermeer's paintings are of contemporary subjects in a smaller format, with a cooler palette dominated by blues, yellows, and grays. Practically all of his surviving works belong to this period, usually domestic interiors with one or two figures lit by a window on the left. They are characterized by a sense of compositional balance and spatial order, unified by a pearly light. Mundane domestic or recreational activities are imbued with a poetic timelessness (e.g., Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window, Dresden, Gemäldegalerie). Vermeer's two townscapes have also been attributed to this period: View of Delft (The Hague, Mauritshuis) and A street in Delft (Amsterdam, <b>Rijksmuseum).</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} 16th-century Amsterdam's Rederijkerskamer (Chamber of rhetoric) {{organised}} contests between different Chambers in the reading of poetry and drama. In 1638, Amsterdam opened its first theatre. Ballet performances were given in this theatre as early as 1642. In the 18th century, French theatre became popular. While Amsterdam was {{under the influence of}} German music in the 19th century there were few national opera productions; the Hollandse Opera of Amsterdam was built in 1888 for the specific purpose of promoting Dutch opera. In the 19th century, popular culture was centred on the Nes area in Amsterdam (mainly vaudeville and music-hall). The metronome, {{one of the most important}} advances in European classical music, was invented here in 1812 by Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel. At the end of this century, the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> and Stedelijk Museum were built. In 1888, the Concertgebouworkest was established. With the 20th century came cinema, radio and television. Though most studios are located in Hilversum and Aalsmeer, Amsterdam's influence on programming is very strong. Many people who work in the television industry live in Amsterdam. Also, the headquarters of the Dutch SBS Broadcasting Group is located in Amsterdam.|$|E
25|$|Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular {{paintings}} at the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> in Amsterdam. It is viewed by about 4,000 to 5,000 visitors daily with its value estimated at $925,000 in the 1970s. The painting was vandalized on several occasions. On 13 January 1911, an unemployed navy cook tried to cut it with a knife, but could not cut through the thick varnish on the painting. In 1975, William de Rijk, an unemployed school teacher, cut dozens of zigzag lines in the painting with a knife before he was wrestled by the guards. The day before, de Rijk had been turned away from the museum because he arrived after closing time. After the event, he was identified with a mental disorder; he was sent to a psychiatric hospital and committed suicide there on 21 April 1976. It took six months to restore the painting, and traces of the cuts still remain. In 1990, a man threw acid on the painting. The guards managed to quickly dilute it with water so that it penetrated only the varnish layer, and the painting was restored again.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, the {{government}} of Egypt decided to build the new Aswan High Dam, whose resulting future reservoir would eventually inundate a large stretch of the Nile valley containing cultural treasures of ancient Egypt and ancient Nubia. In 1959, {{the government}}s of Egypt and Sudan requested UNESCO to assist their countries to protect and rescue the endangered monuments and sites. In 1960, the Director-General of UNESCO launched {{an appeal to the}} Member States for an International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia. This appeal resulted in the excavation and recording of hundreds of sites, the recovery of thousands of objects, as well as the salvage and relocation to higher ground of a number of important temples, the most famous of which are the temple complexes of Abu Simbel and Philae. The campaign, which ended in 1980, was considered a success. As tokens of its gratitude to countries which especially contributed to the campaign's success, Egypt donated four temples: the Temple of Dendur was moved to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Temple of Debod was moved to the Parque del Oeste in Madrid, the Temple of Taffeh was moved to the <b>Rijksmuseum</b> van Oudheden in the Netherlands, and the Temple of Ellesyia to Museo Egizio in Turin.|$|E
