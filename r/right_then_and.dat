500|$|Jackson was {{influenced}} by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: [...] "Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I {{had never seen a}} performer perform like James Brown, and <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do {{for the rest of my}} life because of James Brown." ...|$|E

Sa-Ra member Om'mas Keith remarked on Badu's role at their studio, [...] "Sometimes sheâ€™d come through and pick a skeletal and other times the beats would get made <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there." [...] Keith played instruments such as the Fender Rhodes, Roland Juno-106, and Roland SH-101. Of all her collaborators, Badu only let Husayn write lyrics for her on the album. Husayn said that because Badu had not allowed anyone to do this before, [...] "she {{had to go through}} some personal things to come to the point where she'd let somebody write for her in the manner that we did. It was spontaneous {{but at the same time}} there was structure to it. It might not have the right expression, or the right enunciation. Writing is so personal. That was a big thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Another actress to {{join the}} show was Academy Award winner Whoopi Goldberg, {{who had been a}} long-time Star Trek fan. She {{credited}} Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as an inspiration, saying [...] "Well, when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mum, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!' I knew <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there I could be anything I wanted to be." [...] To appear on the show, Goldberg contacted the producers initially through LeVar Burton. The producers did not believe her as they felt that a movie star such as Goldberg would not want to appear in Star Trek, and ignored calls from her agent, until Goldberg called them personally. A meeting was arranged between her and Rick Berman, and she agreed to appear in six episodes of season two. Her character, Guinan, was named after Mary [...] "Texas" [...] Guinan, a prohibition-era speakeasy owner.|$|E
500|$|In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted Cher (under {{the name}} Cheryl LaPiere) and Georganne, and {{enrolled}} them at Montclair College Preparatory School, {{a private school}} in Encino, whose students were mostly from affluent families. The school's upper-class environment presented a challenge for Cher; biographer Connie Berman wrote, [...] " [...] stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality." [...] A former classmate commented, [...] "I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special... She was like a movie star, <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there... She {{said she was going}} to be a movie star and we knew she would." [...] Despite not being an excellent student, Cher was intelligent and creative, according to Berman. She earned high grades, excelling in French and English classes. As an adult, she discovered that she had dyslexia. Cher achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she performed songs for students during the lunch hours and surprised peers when she wore a midriff-baring top. She later recalled, [...] "I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous." ...|$|E

500|$|Under his {{new stage}} name, LL Cool J (an acronym for Ladies Love Cool James), Smith {{was signed by}} Def Jam, {{which led to the}} release of his first {{official}} record, the 12-inch single [...] "I Need a Beat" [...] (1984). The single was a hard-hitting, streetwise b-boy song with spare beats and ballistic rhymes. Smith later discussed his search for a label, stating [...] "I sent my demo to many different companies, but it was Def Jam where I found my home." [...] That same year, Smith made his professional debut concert performance at Manhattan Center High School. In a later interview, LL Cool J recalled the experience, stating [...] "They pushed the lunch room tables together and me and my DJ, Cut Creator, started playing.... As soon as it was over there were girls screaming and asking for autographs. <b>Right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there I said 'This is what I want to do'." [...] LL's debut single sold over 100,000 copies and helped establish both Def Jam as a label and Smith as a rapper. The commercial success of [...] "I Need a Beat", along with the Beastie Boys' single [...] "Rock Hard" [...] (1984), helped lead Def Jam to a distribution deal with Columbia Records the following year.|$|E

[...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective.

500|$|The season {{also saw}} {{several of the}} show's cast write their own episodes. Series co-star Gillian Anderson {{directed}} and wrote her first episode of the series, [...] "all things". Anderson originally approached Carter about writing and directing an episode of the series during the sixth season. Anderson crafted a script that would see Scully pursuing a [...] "deeply personal X-File, one which in [...] is taken down a spiritual path when logic fails her". Anderson had only a rough outline of the script until one day she wrote {{a majority of the}} story in one sitting. She explained, [...] "A certain concept began to form, [...] I just wrote the entire outline for 'all things' <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> there. It all just kind of came together on the page". The next day, Anderson pitched the script to Carter, who approved of the [...] "personal and quiet" [...] characteristics of the story. In addition, series regular Davis wrote his only episode, [...] "En Ami". Davis approached Carter with his idea about Cigarette Smoking Man trying to seduce Scully with medical knowledge, and Carter, who was intrigued, responded positively to the idea. He assigned executive producer Spotnitz to work with Davis and craft a full-fledged script. The script went through many revisions. Because Cigarette Smoking Man was able to manipulate Scully, Carter later referred to the [...] "En Ami" [...] as [...] "the creepiest episode of the year." ...|$|E

Majel Barrett, referred to as [...] "The First Lady of Star Trek" [...] due to her marriage with Roddenberry, appeared both {{as the voice of}} Starfleet computers and as Lwaxana Troi. The part of Lwaxana was specifically created for her. She had appeared in The Original Series and two Star Trek films as Christine Chapel, and as Number One in the original pilot [...] "". John de Lancie was cast as Q despite missing his first audition as it conflicted with a play he was in at the time. A second audition was arranged, where de Lancie impressed Roddenberry, who told him that [...] "You make my words sound better than they are." [...] Colm Meaney was originally cast as an unnamed Ensign in [...] "Encounter at Farpoint", but was subsequently cast as the Transporter Chief Miles O'Brien, appearing in 52 episodes in that role. Whoopi Goldberg approached the producers and asked for a role in the show, resulting in Roddenberry writing her the part of Guinan. She credits Nichelle Nichols as Uhura in The Original Series as inspiring her, saying [...] "when I was nine years old Star Trek came on, I looked at it and I went screaming through the house, 'Come here, mom, everybody, come quick, come quick, there's a black lady on television and she ain't no maid!'

[...] Cyrus explained it was about attempting to avoid paparazzi but they appeared, [...] "not going away like little annoying flies." [...] Cyrus was inspired to write [...] "Bottom of the Ocean" [...] by her deceased fish, Lyric and Melody, who died when Cyrus was eleven years of age. She said the topic drifted drastically once she began writing. [...] "It's saying if there's someone you've loved but for some reason you can't love them anymore, you have to take your feelings, scoop them out, and put them {{at the bottom of the}} ocean." [...] Cyrus, Armato, James, Aaron Dudley co-wrote [...] "Wake Up America", a track about environmentalism.

Francia testified that the third time, Jackson had reached up the leg of Francia's shorts and touched his testicles. Francia claimed he needed five years of therapy because of the ordeal. [...] He received settlement money from Jackson, and testified that he thought he deserved even more. [...] Francia also admitted that he and his mother had sold stories of his alleged inappropriate tickling to the tabloids. When Jason Francia originally talked to the police after the 1993 allegations, he told them he had never been touched inappropriately. [...] He made that claim only after extensive police questioning in which they repeatedly called Jackson a [...] "molester" [...] and told Jason that Macaulay Culkin was being molested <b>right</b> <b>then</b> <b>and</b> Jason could {{put a stop to it}} if he confessed.
