50|$|In 1818 Crossmyloof was {{described}} as the most populous village in Cathcart parish. Although till recently 'remarkable chiefly for being a resort of vagrants', the writer was happy to report that the village had now become more respectable from {{an increase in the}} number of its inhabitants, who now amounted to around 500. The remarks were a little premature, because in November 1820 two members of a band of armed ruffians who robbed a house in Crossmyloof were hanged in front of the Jail in the Saltmarket. The attack took place at the home of Dr Robert Watt, the author of the four volume Bibliothica Britanica, who had died, allegedIy of overwork, the previous year. His terrified widow had a pistol held at her head and her gold <b>rings</b> <b>wrenched</b> off her fingers. She is reported as having hastily left Crossmyloof for the safety of a home in Hutchesontown. When the Rev James Smith wrote his account of Cathcart parish in 1840, he used the name Westfield for the village and gave the number of families as 124 and the total population as 587 persons. At this period the villagers were mostly cotton handloom weavers. The only remaining woollen weaver was William AIgie, assisted by his seven children, three of whom wove woollen cloth, and four of whom worked in cotton. Two elderly women, Mary Sinclair, a muslin flowerer, and Margaret Wotherspoon, a muslin tambourer, were probably the last of the skilled embroideresses in the village. There were also a few shopkeepers, a blacksmith, several brassfounders and tinsmiths and William Ferguson, a lithographic engraver.|$|R
60|$|Then {{hoisting}} him, {{we pushed}} him out, {{and he fell}} on the stones with a great, dull thud. A mighty shout burst from the mob as they rushed at the body. One man tore the chain off his neck, but as he was running away with it another snatched at it. In the struggle it broke, and one got away with the chain, the other with the jewel. Then, with cries of hate, they set on the corpse. They kicked him and slapped his face and spat on him. The <b>rings</b> were <b>wrenched</b> off his fingers, his coat was torn away; they took his shoes, his hose; {{in less than a}} minute everything had been robbed, and he was lying naked, naked as when he was born. They had no mercy those people; they began to laugh and jeer, and make foul jokes about his nakedness.|$|R
