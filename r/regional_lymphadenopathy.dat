30|$|Some {{cases of}} AFP-producing lung {{carcinoma}} {{were reported in}} the 1980 s. Ishikura et al. first reviewed seven cases of AFP-producing lung carcinoma in 1990 and diagnosed {{five of the seven}} cases with HAC [1]. Since that time, 18 cases of HAC of the lung have been reported [1 – 10], clarifying the clinicopathological and immunohistochemical features. According to those reports, HAC is associated with large tumor, AFP production, poor prognosis, a predilection for older patients, <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> and distant metastases [2, 6]. Some studies have described long-term survival of 2 – 7  years [6 – 9]. These cases were all in the early pathological stage, with two cases in stage IIB, one in stage IIA, and one in stage IB. Our case was likewise in stage IB and has so far survived 51  months postoperatively. From the above findings, curative resection at an early stage could contribute to long-term survival.|$|R
50|$|The venom {{is highly}} toxic, {{although}} it is produced in very small amounts. Bites are common in some areas. Often, snake handlers are bitten who are unaware that this species is able to bite while being held by the neck. Bite symptoms usually include mild to intense pain, local swelling with occasional blistering and necrosis and <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathy.</b> No fatalities have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|Cat-scratch disease {{commonly}} presents as tender, swollen {{lymph nodes}} {{near the site of}} the inoculating bite or scratch or on the neck, and is usually limited to one side. This condition is referred to as <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> and occurs 1-3 weeks after inoculation. Lymphadenopathy in CSD most commonly occurs in the arms, neck, or jaw, but may also occur near the groin or around the ear. A vesicle or an erythematous papule may form at the site of initial infection. Most patients also develop systemic symptoms such as malaise, decreased appetite, and aches. Other associated complaints include headache, chills, muscular pains, joint pains, arthritis, backache, and abdominal pain. It may take 7 to 14 days, or as long as two months, for symptoms to appear. Most cases are benign and self-limiting, but lymphadenopathy may persist for several months after other symptoms disappear. The disease usually resolves spontaneously, with or without treatment, in one month.|$|E
5000|$|Pseudechis guttatus (the blue-bellied black snake or spotted black snake) is {{a species}} of black snake that is only found in the inland areas of {{south-eastern}} Queensland and northern New South Wales. On average, their measurement is 1.25 m, but some snakes {{have been found to}} measure as long as 2 m. Their diet consists of frogs, lizards, and small mammals, therefore making them carnivorous. [...] They, like most other snakes, are oviparous, laying 7-12 eggs during their breeding season. It is unknown what their average venom ejection is. When mice are bitten, the snake's venom is the most toxic of all the black snakes. They are naturally very shy, and will not bite unless provoked (by being stepped on by a boot, prodded by a stick, etc.). If a human is bitten, they may suffer severe pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, diaphoresis and <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> at the location of the bite, similar to a red-bellied black snake's bite symptoms. Bites are infrequent. If bitten, tiger snake antivenom is the preferred treatment.|$|E

It {{can be defined as}} a lymphoma that occurs in the bone, consisting of a single bone lesion with or without <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> and its underlying causes are largely unknown. In this case report, we describe a male who presented with left-sided distal forearm pain, swelling of 2 months duration, and progressive limited wrist motion for about 1 month. The patient had no significant medical history except diabetes. Magnetic Resonance Imaging demonstrated a sheet-like bone destruction area in the left-sided radius, localized discontinuous bone cortex, and adjacent soft tissue masses. Finally, a bone biopsy examined by histopathological and immunochemical methods confirmed a diagnosis of primary bone diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Due to the rarity of this disease, the level of evidence supporting some diagnostic and therapeutic decisions remains low, and therefore, the details of the rare case may facilitate treatment of similar diseases and provide insight about this obscure lymphoproliferative malignancy.

40|$|Our {{goal was}} to detect whether spotted fever group Rickettsia {{are found in the}} {{suspected}} vector of rickettsioses, Amblyomma triste, in Uruguay. Rickettsia parkeri was detected in A. triste, which suggests that this species could be considered a pathogenic agent responsible for human rickettsioses in Uruguay. In South America, cases of rickettsioses produced by the genus Rickettsia have been described in several countries in the last 20 years. The first three native cases of rickettsioses in Uruguay were reported in 1990. Patients had an initial small necrotic lesion (eschar) on the tick-bite point of attachment, fever and <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathies,</b> an erythematous maculopapular rash, or any combination of these symptoms. Ticks involved in these cases were classified as Amblyomma triste (1), formerly thought to be A. maculatum (2). A. triste is a neotropical tick species with a variety of hosts (3, 4). It is the main tick species feeding on humans in Uruguay, and it is the primary candidate vector for transmitting rickettsioses in this country (5). According to the literature (2), Rickettsia conorii has been the causative agent of rickettsial diseases in Uruguay, but the evidence has been only serologic (by antirickettsial microimmunofluorescence testing) in all patients with suspected rickettsioses (6, 7). Neither rickettsial isolation nor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification from human blood samples from patients from Uruguay have been performed. However, as has been suggested (8), other tick-transmitted rickettsiae could be present in Uruguay.

5000|$|P. multocida {{causes a}} range of {{diseases}} in wild and domesticated animals, as well as humans. The bacterium {{can be found in}} birds, cats, dogs, rabbits, cattle, and pigs. In birds, P. multocida causes avian or fowl cholera disease; a significant disease present in commercial and domestic poultry flocks worldwide, particularly layer flocks and parent breeder flocks. P. multocida strains that cause fowl cholera in poultry typically belong to the serovars 1, 3, and 4. In the wild, fowl cholera has been shown to follow bird migration routes, especially of snow geese. The P. multocida serotype-1 is most associated with avian cholera in North America, but the bacterium does not linger in wetlands for extended periods of time. [...] P. multocida causes atrophic rhinitis in pigs; it also can cause pneumonia or bovine respiratory disease in cattle. [...] In humans, P. multocida is {{the most common cause of}} infection from wound infections after dog or cat bites. The infection usually shows as soft tissue inflammation within 24 hours. High leukocyte and neutrophil counts are typically observed, leading to an inflammatory reaction at the infection site (generally a diffuse, localized cellulitis). [...] It can also infect other locales, such as the respiratory tract, and is known to cause <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> (swelling of the lymph nodes). In more serious cases, a bacteremia can result, causing an osteomyelitis or endocarditis. The bacteria may also cross the blood-brain barrier and cause meningitis.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{lymphocytic}} leukemia (CLL) is a monoclonal disorder, {{characterized by a}} progressive proliferation of functionally incompetent B lymphocytes. There is increased evidence of association between CLL and skin cancers, including the uncommon Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Case presentation A case report of an 84 -year old male, who presented with an aggressively recurrent form of MCC on the lower lip, on the background of an 8 -year history of untreated CLL. During the recurrences of MCC, coexisting <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathy,</b> posed {{a problem in the}} differential diagnosis and treatment of lymph node involvement. Histopathology and immunoistochemistry showed that submandibular lymphadenopathy coexisting with the second recurrence of MCC, was due to B-cell small lymphocytic lymphoma. The subsequent and more aggressive recurrence of the skin tumor had involved the superficial and deep cervical lymph nodes. Surgical excision followed by involved field radiation therapy has been proven effective for both malignancies. Conclusion MCC has a high incidence of <b>regional</b> <b>lymphadenopathy</b> at presentation (12 – 45 %) and even when it arises on the background of chronic leucemia, lymphadenopathy at presentation should be managed agressively with elective lymph node dissection.
