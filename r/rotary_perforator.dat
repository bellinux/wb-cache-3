40|$|Pesticides on a nitrophenol {{basis and}} nitrophenols {{which may be}} formed by {{biotransformation}} from other plant-protecting agents may be extracted from aqueous samples with high recoveries by continuous liquid/liquid extraction using a <b>rotary</b> <b>perforator</b> and by solid phase extraction, respectively. Determination of these compounds in possible by high performance liquid chromatography with photodiode array detection where identification is based both on the retention time and the UV spectra. Alternatively, a gas chromatographic analysis after derivatization with heptafluorobutyric anhydride has been evaluated...|$|E
40|$|An all-glass {{miniaturized}} light-phase <b>rotary</b> <b>perforator</b> for the enrichment of polar compounds {{has been}} modified/miniaturized and applied. Its application is demonstrated {{here for the}} analysis of nitrophenols and dinitrophenols from low-concentration/low-volume samples. For the method development of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) four eluents were tested: (1) water-methanol, (2) acetic acid-methanol, (3) trifluoroacetic acid-methanol and (4) water-acetonitrile. The last eluent mentioned was used for the subsequent investigation of samples from field experiments. Detection limits varied between 1 ng and 50 pg. The relative standard deviation in repeated measurements was below 15 %, corresponding to a good reproducibility. Recoveries ranged between 31 and 100 %, showing a significant dependence on the extraction time and the final volume of the sample after evaporation. Quantification was carried out by using deuterated 4 -nitrophenol and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol as standards and applying previously determined response factors. Structure determination of further substances under atmospheric pressure chemical ionization was performed by a first screening with a source collision-induced dissociation, followed by the definite analysis by MS(n). The first results are shown for cloud water, fog water and rainwater samples from different locations...|$|E
