50|$|Both macroalgae and microalgae {{are being}} {{investigated}} as possible means of carbon sequestration. Because algae lack the complex lignin associated with terrestrial plants, the carbon in algae is {{released into the}} atmosphere more rapidly than carbon captured on land. Algae have been proposed as a short-term storage pool of carbon {{that can be used}} as a feedstock for the production of various biogenic fuels. Microalgae are often put forth as a potential feedstock for carbon-neutral biodiesel and biomethane production due to their high lipid content. Macroalgae, on the other hand, do not have high lipid content and have limited potential as biodiesel feedstock, although they can still be used as feedstock for other biofuel generation. Macroalgae have also been investigated as a feedstock for the production of biochar. The biochar produced from macroalgae is higher in agriculturally important nutrients than biochar produced from terrestrial sources. Another novel approach to carbon capture which utilizes algae is the Bicarbonate-based Integrated Carbon Capture and Algae Production Systems (BICCAPS) developed by a collaboration between Washington State University in the United States and Dalian Ocean University in China. Many cyanobacteria, microalgae, and macroalgae species can utilize carbonate as a carbon source for photosynthesis. In the BICCAPS, alkaliphilic microalgae utilize carbon captured from flue gases in the form of bicarbonate. In South Korea, macroalgae have been utilized as part of a climate change mitigation program. The country has established the Coastal CO2 <b>Removal</b> <b>Belt</b> (CCRB) which is composed of artificial and natural ecosystems. The goal is to capture carbon using large areas of kelp forest.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{majority}} of aero-engine components are designed and manufactured with nickel-based superalloy GH 4169 in mind. There is little information {{available in the}} literature related to belt grinding processes of aero-engine components. Up to now, limited research {{has been reported in}} the use of belt for grinding aero-engine components made of nickel-based superalloy GH 4169. A case study of an abrasive belt grinding performance applied on nickel-based superalloy GH 4169 in manufacturing processes is presented, aiming to investigate the possibility of using belt grinding as a operation for components made of nickel-based superalloy GH 4169. For the ‘optimised ’ grinding conditions, the belt service life is evaluated by changing grinding parameters (grinding speed, contact force and oscillation frequency), and the following output measures are obtained: material <b>removal,</b> <b>belt</b> wear and grinding ratio. As a result, the maximum grinding ratio of G is 8. 8, it could be concluded that belt grinding might be considered as a viable process for grinding aero-engine components...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{analysis}} of the action of surfactant in granite grinding with diamond disk, the effects of the grinding coolant with different surfactant and concentration were studied in belt grinding of granite. The influences of different factors on belt grinding were analyzed and the machining parameters are optimized by experiments. The results show that <b>belt</b> <b>removal</b> rate was increased greatly using grinding coolant with surfactants. The grinding speed and grit mesh of belt and the rotating speed of table will affect the functions of surfactant in belt grinding process...|$|R
40|$|The <b>removal</b> of {{radiation}} <b>belt</b> electrons through pitch-angle scattering by the observed obliquely propagating plasmaspheric whistler wave band is investigated. Electron lifetimes are calculated {{as a function}} of L and energy. The effects of high latitude interactions and of oblique wave propagation with the resulting diffusion at all cyclotron harmonics are quantitatively incorporated into the calculations. The inclusion of these effects appears to extend the role of whistler-driven electron pitch-angle diffusion to provide an explanation of the positioning of the quiet time radiation belt electron slot and the electron losses within the slot region...|$|R
5000|$|The Weimar Republic {{revived the}} Stielhandgranate, {{and created a}} new version in 1924, the [...] "Model 1924 Stielhandgranate" [...] (M24) This design, unlike the {{previous}} M1916 and M1917, did include some rather significant changes to the original. While still retaining the same explosive, and same fuse, the main distinction between the Model 1924 and Model 1915 is a slightly shorter charge head, and most significantly the <b>removal</b> of a <b>belt</b> carry clip. Another very minor change in the design was a lengthening of the wooden handle. The intent of these design alterations was simply for mobility; German soldiers could easily (and often did) tuck the grenade in behind their uniform's belt, held tight and secure. Being slightly lighter, and smaller in thickness, it improved usage overall.|$|R
40|$|Urban Dynamics (UD) {{modeling}} as {{a derivative}} approach of System Dynamics {{is useful in}} measuring the various impacts originating from the dynamic interrelationship between urban subsystems and proposed urban policies. This research revisits the basic premises defined by existing UD documents and examines the feasibility of alternative UD models. As a specific example, this research focuses on behavioral changes of urban dynamics if the Green Belt areas in Seoul and the Capital Region as a whole are readjusted. The measurements are based upon a series of simulation works on the urban system, going beyond the traditional triplicate set of population, housing, and business activities. This research estimates that the <b>removal</b> of Green <b>Belt</b> control would definitely exert {{a significant impact on}} the urban dynamics of Seoul. The government-initiated Green Belt cancellation, however, would rather decrease the population size of Seoul and at the same time result in deterioration of overall quality of life (QOL) in the long-run as both Seoul and the Capital Region are interconnected by causal loops. Sensitivity analysis suggests, among others, that Seoul may lose 1. 5 million or more people while the rest of the Capital Region would have to accommodate most of the out-migrated Seoul population over the next three decades. Judging from these research findings, this paper recommends that key stakeholders, including both citizens and policy makers, should decide how to deal with the major trade-off questions on the urban policy agenda...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the shear strength characteristics, energy absorption capacity and brittleness index of sand-tire crumb mixtures using simple direct shear test and Unconsolidated Undrained (UU) triaxial test for the effective use of waste tire crumbs for seismic isolation of building. Tire crumbs were prepared with special machinery where scrap tires were crushed into pieces and powders after <b>removal</b> of steel <b>belting.</b> The processed tire crumbs obtained from local industry were sieved into four size groups, i. e. 8 mm - 5. 6 mm, 5. 6 mm - 4. 75 mm, 4. 75 mm - 2 mm, and 2 mm - 1 mm and relatively uniform sand has been selected to generate sand-tire crumb mixtures (STCM). Grouped tire crumbs are mixed with sand to generate STCM samples having 0 %, 10 %, 15 %, 20 %, 25 %, and 30 % tire crumbs by volume. Direct shear and UU triaxial compression tests have been carried out on STCM samples for different normal and confining pressure with constant density of 1. 54 g/cc. Stress-strain curves obtained from UU test for different confine pressure have been used to estimate energy absorption capacity by measuring area of stress-strain curve up to strain level of 20 % for different size and percentage of tire crumbs. The experimental results show that the parameters controlling shear strength, energy absorption and stiffness are tire crumb size, percentage of crumbs, normal stress and confining pressure. Peak strength was significantly increased by adding rubber with sand. It is found that peak strength, energy absorption and stiffness increases with increasing percentage of tire crumbs up to 25 %. Among tests of different tire crumb sizes, 5. 60 mm gives maximum efficiency than other crumb sizes...|$|R
40|$|Ammonia (NH 3) {{emission}} is environmentally {{important because}} of its contribution to acidification of soil and water and increased nitrogen deposition in ecosystems. Ammonia emission rates (ER) of two commercial manure-belt (MB) layer houses with in Iowa were monitored for a full year. Ammonia ER showed considerable diurnal variation, {{but not as much}} in seasonal variation. Data from the 12 -month monitoring revealed an annual average NH 3 ER of 0. 054 g d- 1 hen- 1 (varying from 0. 002 to 0. 195 g d- 1 hen- 1) from the MB houses when the manure was removed daily. Results of the study contribute to the U. S. national inventory on NH 3 emissions from animal feeding operations;While manure <b>removal</b> via manure <b>belt</b> system is effective in improving indoor air quality and reducing house-level emissions, manure transferred into storage facility also emits NH 3 and needs to be quantified. The effects of moisture content of the manure, ambient temperature, surface to volume ratio (SVR) of manure stack, air exchange rate, and duration of the manure storage on NH 3 emission were quantified. Rising ambient temperature enhances NH 3 emission of the manure stack at the rate of 6 % per degree Celsius rise for the temperature range of 21 to 32 °C. The NH 3 emission rate (ER) from manure stack at 50 % moisture content (MC) is 59 % of the NH 3 ER from manure stack at 77 % MC. A regression model was developed to describe the NH 3 emissions from manure stack with five SVRs and storage time. Reducing emissions from manure storage is of practical significance to the improved environmental stewardship. Four topically applied chemical additives (zeolite, alum, Ferix- 3 and PLT) were tested to evaluate the efficiency on NH 3 emission reduction from stored laying hen manure. The results provide the base line NH 3 emission data from poultry manure storage and potential solutions to mitigate NH 3 emission;In addition, indirect CO 2 balance method and direct ventilation rate measurement method using a Fan Assessment Numeration System were compared in a commercial manure-belt laying hen house. The results showed that careful application of the indirect method could greatly improve the affordability and versatility of endeavors toward quantifying air emissions from confined animal housing...|$|R
