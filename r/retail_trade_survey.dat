40|$|This paper {{attributes}} {{slower than}} predicted growth in e-commerce retailing to four factors: consumer resistance; {{the ability of}} traditional retailers to become multi-channel sellers; prudent official survey and classification practices; and perhaps the limited range of “pure-play” business models (i. e., retail models that rely mainly on electronic sales). Based on responses to the Census Bureau’s Monthly <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey</b> (MRTS) in the five fourth quarter periods from 2001 to 2005, the paper finds that e-commerce has claimed a small but rapidly growing share of U. S. retailing markets; and that pure play companies are still important drivers of this process. However, it also finds that the capacity of pure-play companies to continue in this role may be nearing its limits, and {{that the rate of}} continued growth in e-commerce retailing may depend on the business decisions of large, multi-channel sellers. Qualified researchers can access MRTS-based quarterly e-commerce data for 2001 - 2005 at the Census Bureau’s Regional Data Centers. e-commerce, retailing, pure-play retailing, Monthly <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{information}} content of two survey indicators for consumption {{developments in the}} near future for eight European countries in the period 1985 - 1998. Empirical work on this topic typically focuses on consumer confidence, the perceptions of buyers of consumption goods. This paper examines whether perceptions of sellers of consumption goods, measured by <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> <b>surveys,</b> may also improve short-term monitoring of consumption. We find that both consumer confidence and retailer confidence embody valuable information, when analysed in isolation. For France, Italy and Spain we conclude that adding retail confidence does not improve the indicator model once consumer confidence has been included. For the UK the reverse case is obtained. For the remaining four countries we show that combining consumer sentiment and <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> confidence into a composite indicator leads to optimal results. Our results suggest that incorporating information from <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> <b>surveys</b> may offer significant benefits for the analysis of short-term prospects of consumption.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> {{is one of the most}} {{important}} parts of any economy. <b>Retail</b> <b>trade</b> is also a very important component of GDP, whereby rising <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> means a growth in consumption and a fall in unemployment.

40|$|Fractional {{imputation}} (FI) is {{a relatively}} new method of imputation for handling item nonresponse in survey sampling. In FI, several imputed values with their fractional weights are created for each missing item. Each fractional weight represents the conditional probability of the imputed value given the observed data, and the parameters in the conditional probabilities are often computed by an iterative method such as EM algorithm. The underlying model for FI can be fully parametric, semiparametric, or nonparametric, depending on plausibility of assumptions and the data structure. In this paper, we give an overview of FI, introduce key ideas and methods to readers who are new to the FI literature, and highlight some new development.

40|$|The Monthly Wholesale and <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey</b> (MWRTS), {{conducted}} by Statistics Canada, produces estimates at various geographic and industry levels based on monthly data collected for sales and inventories. The sales trend {{is used as}} an important economic indicator, and the monthly sales estimates form {{a substantial portion of}} the estimates for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The MWRTS is currently being redesigned, in part to produce estimates according to the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and to take full advantage of the availability of administrative data from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) program. Although many improvements will be implemented, such as a reduction of frame mis-classifications by the use of administrative data and an innovative sample update procedure, influential units will continue to occur as a result of mis-classifications and specific procedures must be put in place to treat them.

40|$|IntroductionOnline <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> is {{a current}} topic of {{discussion}} within the Australian community. Interest centres on the size and growth of online <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> {{as well as its}} performance relative to traditional store-based <b>retail</b> <b>trade.</b> This information paper explains where online <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> activity is currently included in ABS macroeconomic statistics and describes enhancements to improve measurement and coverage of online <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> activity in both <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> statistics and the wider macroeconomic accounts. Defining online retail tradeThe Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) defines ‘retail trade’ as “the purchase and onselling, commission-based buying, and commission-based selling of goods, without significant transformation, to the general public”. This broad definition includes the sale of goods to the general public using non-traditional means, including the internet. Online <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> may be defined according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) definition of e-commerce. Using this definition, an electronic transaction is the sale of goods and/or services which are ordered via the Internet or any other computer-mediated network. This applies regardless of whether the payment and/or the ultimate delivery of the goods and/or services is conducted online or offline. Therefore, all <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> activity where the commitment to purchase is made online may be considered to be online <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> activity, irrespective of the method of payment and/or delivery used. Other descriptions of online <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> have also emerged to distinguish between different forms of online <b>retail</b> <b>trade.</b> Retailers who trade with consumers solely via an online store, and have no physical store, are commonly referred to as ‘pure-play’ online retailers. Similarly, retailers who combine a physical store with other non-traditional means such as catalogues, mail-order, telephone-order and/or an online store, are commonly referred to as ‘multi-channel’ retailers.  ...|$|R

40|$|Survey {{quality is}} an {{important}} goal for National Statistics Offices (NSOs) and non-response negatively affects this quality. Accordingly, {{it is important to}} understand the determinants and patterns of non-response, with the aim of providing recommendations as to how to reduce or mitigate non-response. This study looks to better categorise sampled firms based on their previous response behaviour, using trajectory modelling. Trajectory modelling is a tool for distinguishing patterns of behaviour over time, with dual trajectory modelling allowing us to analyse how outcomes in one time period are related to distinct outcomes in time two (Jones and Nagin, 2007). Using dual trajectory modelling to examine longitudinal response patterns is a new application of this model. Statistics New Zealand’s <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey</b> is used as a test case and the model is fitted across the response history 2003 to 2007. We were able to identify three response groups, the good-responders, the group whose likelihood of response improves over time and the non-respondents. These three groups then form the basis for four groups we identified in time two. This then informs some tentative recommendations as how to best target sample members, based on previous response behaviour...|$|E
40|$|The Canadian Monthly Wholesale and <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey</b> (MWRTS) {{produces}} monthly {{estimates for}} sales and inventories at various province and industry levels. The MWRTS {{has recently been}} redesigned, in part, to provide estimates for the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and {{to take full advantage}} of administrative data from the Goods and Services Tax program.

As part of the redesign, different tools were developed to ensure proper monitoring of survey steps. The first type of ‘diagnostic ’ tool aims to assess the functionality of the modules in each survey step while the second type involves monthly descriptive statistics, such as number of live units in the sample, imputation methods used and recurrent top contributors. These statistics are studied longitudinally to detect changes that affect the estimates. A third set of diagnostic tools is used for analysis of level and trend estimates. Finally, some of the major tools used on a monthly basis for this survey will be described in this paper...|$|E

40|$|The Canadian Quarterly Retail Commodity Survey (QRCS), {{developed}} in 1997, collects data and produces {{estimates of the}} sales distribution for retail commodities such as food, clothing and furniture. The survey uses a two-phase stratified sample design, where the first phase is the Monthly <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey</b> (MRTS). Both surveys are now undergoing a redesign, in part to provide estimates for the new North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), and {{to take full advantage}} of administrative data from the Good and Services Tax (GST) program. The new QRCS will retain its two-phase stratified sample design, with a multivariate optimal sample allocation to maximize efficiency of the design for major commodities. Nevertheless, many changes will be brought to the design. For example, to reduce respondent burden on smaller units, the survey will not collect data for a large portion of its population; these units however represent less than 5 % of total sales. The production of commodity estimates for the non-survey and survey population, with the added constraint that total sales must be benchmarked to those of the MRTS, constitutes an interesting challenge. This paper discusses the changes brought about by the redesign and presents the survey processes that will be implemented in the new QRCS survey such as sample design, sample and frame maintenance, edit and imputation, and estimation methodology...|$|E
40|$|Business surveys {{dealing with}} skewed populations often resort to {{stratified}} sampling designs. The {{efficiency of the}} stratified sampling design depends largely {{on the quality of}} the stratification variables in terms of their accuracy and timeliness, and their stability through time in the case of repeated surveys with sample overlap. The Monthly Wholesale and <b>Retail</b> <b>Trade</b> <b>Survey</b> (MWRTS) of Statistics Canada uses a stratified sampling design that can suffer from the undesirable effects of misclassified units on the level and the precision of the estimates. Many innovative solutions have been developed within the sampling design, within the frame and sample update processes, and at the estimation stage to reduce the impact of such units for the redesigned MWRTS that will be implemented in 2004. We developed an improved size measure for stratification purposes using data from other surveys and administrative files like the Goods and Services Tax (GST) files. We used an enhanced version of the Lavallée-Hidiroglou algorithm which takes into account the impact of dead units when determining size boundaries and an optimal sample allocation. We use sample constraints such as maximum allowable weights to reduce the impact of misclassified units in take-some strata. New frame and sample update procedures allow the monitoring and treatment of units that are no longer part of the proper size stratum in an unbiased manner. To deal with misclassified units at the estimation stage we investigated the use of post-stratification based on counts and developed an outlier detection and treatment strategy. In this communication, each of the new measures developed to reduce the impact of misclassified units in the MWRTS is discussed in detail, as well as their implementation in the context of a monthly production cycle...|$|E

Nonetheless, this article will attempt to state a summary of the most important, determining factors for the current changes in structure and regional function in the core areas of the Eastern Central and Eastern European major cities, and to typify the transformation in the city centre location patterns of <b>retail</b> <b>trade.</b> In th is context, the initial thesis is that new developments of company forms and city centre location patterns in <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> which are manifest in Eastern Central and Eastern Europe are essentially determined by complex issues of company structures and regional factors. The influential factors of company structure are a) the course and results of transformation in ownership laws in <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> effected by both privatisation measures and the establishment of new companies, b) the general economic (endogenous and exogenous) framework which follows the privat isation and/or new establishment of companies and which decide the further development of <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> and c) the transformation of the real estate and property markets. The three regional determinants, which are responsible for the changes in the location pattern in <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> and for the transformation of the functional order of the city centre, refer to a) the structure and function of the existing building substance and the possibilities for its use in <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> b) competition with other locations of <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> inside and outside of the city and c) the scope of private use and/or suitability of public space for use by informal <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> such as kiosks and market stalls. Five different types of new location pattern in city centre <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> and current regional changes in the cities of Eastern Central and Eastern Europe can be identified: 1.) A regionally disorganised location pattern with barely distinct hierarchical areas of function, for example in Moscow and St. Petersburg. 2.)

The city centre <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> st ructures in the new Federal states (former GDR), which are characterised in part by extreme exclusiveness and in part by a banalisation of the range of goods, and which are in very extreme competition with expansive, non-integrated <b>retail</b> <b>trade</b> which has developed outside of the cities. 4.) Relatively autochtonous / independent development within city centre <b>retail</b> <b>trade,</b> with a general formation of hierarchical location patterns, e. g. in Riga (Latvia), Tallinn (Estonia) and many large Polish cities. 5.)
