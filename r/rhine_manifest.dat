Charming!--Spain beaten, and all the hither Germany conquered. Bravo! Better and better still!--But they will retain all their conquests on a treaty. Best of all!--What a delightful thing {{it is to have}} a gay physician, who sees all things, as the French express it, couleur de rose! What an escape we have had, that we and our allies were not the conquerors! By these conquests, previous to her utter destruction, she is [...] "wholly to lose that preponderance which she held in the scale of the European powers." [...] Bless me! this new system of France, after changing all other laws, reverses the law of gravitation. By throwing in weight after weight, her scale rises, and will by-and-by kick the beam. Certainly there is one sense in which she loses her preponderance: that is, she is no longer preponderant against the countries she has conquered. They are part of herself. But I beg the author to keep his eyes fixed on the scales for a moment longer, and then to tell me, in downright earnest, whether he sees hitherto any signs of her losing preponderance by an augmentation of weight and power. Has she lost her preponderance over Spain by her influence in Spain? Are there any signs that the conquest of Savoy and Nice begins to lessen her preponderance over Switzerland and the Italian States,--or that the Canton of Berne, Genoa, and Tuscany, for example, have taken arms against her,--or that Sardinia is more adverse than ever to a treacherous pacification? Was it in the last week of October that the German States showed that Jacobin. France was losing her preponderance? Did the King of Prussia, when he delivered into her safe custody his territories {{on this side of the}} <b>Rhine,</b> <b>manifest</b> any tokens of his opinion of her loss of preponderance? Look on Sweden and on Denmark: is her preponderance less visible there? ...|$|E
40|$|The new {{technique}} of simultaneous inversion for hypocentres and crustal structure (SSH) {{is applied to}} the southern Rhine Graben. P and S wave first and later arrival times of direct, refracted and reflected phases of 350 seismic events are used in the study. Substantial improvements of over 100 per cent in the non-linear residual fit are obtained for the 3 -D and less for the 1 -D models. Many of the structural results of the 3 -D SSH models are consistent with major findings from other seismic refraction experiments and fit into the general geological, petrological and geodyna-mica 1 frame of this area. Thus the thick sedimentary layer in the <b>Rhine</b> Graben proper <b>manifests</b> itself by large negative seismic velocity anomalies. For the middle crust the SSH models show a strong seismic differentiation between sections of the graben proper and the areas under its western and eastern shoulders of the Vosges and the Black Forest, respectively. Using a new a priori Bayesian inversion technique it has been attempted to substantiate the refraction-seismic low velocity zone of Gajewski & Prodehl (1987) in the middle crust under the Black Forest. The results demonstrate that such a velocity low is compatible with the observe...|$|R
