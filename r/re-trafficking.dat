50|$|The City of Vienna’s {{specialist}} {{center for}} unaccompanied minors accommodated 121 children in 2009, {{some of whom}} were reported to be victims of trafficking. This center reportedly facilitated the repatriation of children subjected to forced prostitution and forced begging during the reporting period. However, according to local observers, this center has limited capacity to accommodate trafficked children, does not function as an anti-trafficking NGO, and there was little official follow-up or assurances made to ensure a safe return or protection from <b>re-trafficking.</b> Furthermore, the center only accommodated children who had been apprehended by the police, and is an open facility, allowing traffickers continued access to their victims.|$|E
50|$|A 2009 Human Rights Watch Report {{cited the}} French {{government}} for alleged abusive police treatment and the forced removal of unaccompanied minors from Roissy Charles de Gaulle Airport. The report described French authorities’ policy of detaining unaccompanied minors, including potential trafficking victims, in a designated “transit zone” at the airport. French authorities failed to screen these children for indications of trafficking, treating them as irregular migrants, {{which resulted in}} their deportation and which could make them vulnerable to <b>re-trafficking</b> or persecution in their home countries. The report documented two {{cases in which the}} government failed to adequately identify two children from Nigeria and Guinea as trafficking victims, in one case the victim’s trafficker visited her in detention to collect money. Reportedly, the French Red Cross regularly alerts French authorities about the need to improve the response to children who appear to be trafficking victims.|$|E
50|$|The U.A.E. {{has made}} {{efforts to prevent}} {{trafficking}} this year. To {{address the issue of}} non-payment of wages, which contributes to the debt bondage of some workers, the Ministry of Labor announced in October 2007 that salaries of foreign workers must be paid through an electronic system that can be monitored; this nascent system is increasing, but is not yet uniform. To support child camel jockeys and prevent <b>re-trafficking,</b> the U.A.E. committed approximately $8 million to UNICEF to aid repatriated camel jockeys; separately, the U.A.E. signed Memoranda of Understanding with Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sudan, and Mauritania to establish claims facilities to compensate former child camel jockeys for their injuries. The Emirati government provided $15 million in financial assistance to a global UN conference on trafficking. The government did not make significant efforts to raise public awareness of trafficking issues domestically, such as among Emirati employers of foreign workers. Similarly, the government did not initiate a significant public awareness campaign to reduce the demand for commercial sex acts. Dubai authorities shut down two nightclubs notorious for prostitution of foreign nationals. The government did not institute an awareness program targeted for nationals traveling to known child sex tourism destinations abroad. The U.A.E. has not yet ratified the 2000 UN TIP Protocol.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This project aims to {{describe}} and unravel the complexities within prostitution and trafficking, paying {{special attention to the}} women who are <b>re-trafficked</b> and the reasons why. In doing so the report discusses various psychological, existential and cultural relations to women who are or have been trafficked, and the repercussions these have in the aftermath. Employing two vignettes as real life examples the project determines the most important factors, when helping trafficked victims who face the possibility of getting <b>re-trafficked...</b>|$|R
50|$|Some NGOs {{provided}} such victim {{services to}} male victims. According to NGOs, some rescued slave laborers have been <b>re-trafficked,</b> {{due to lack}} of effective prosecutions of recruiters of trabalho escravo, few alternate forms of employment for the rescued workers, and lack of legal aid to help them pursue their own complaints against exploitative employers.|$|R
40|$|A {{fact-finding mission}} was {{undertaken}} by HAQ: Centre for Child Rights in June 2006 {{at the request}} of the Child Welfare Committee, Nirmal Chhaya, Delhi, to follow-up on the children rescued from the Zari industry in June 2005 and January 2006 by Bachpan Bachao Andolan and Bandhua Mukti Morcha respectively. To get information about the traffickers, the practices they adopt for procuring children from the source area and their proximity to the vulnerable families in order to assess the possibilities and threats of children being <b>re-trafficked.</b> The ability of the traffickers to constantly lure young children in the name of better life and opportunities is not unknown.

50|$|The Government of Guinea-Bissau {{continued}} to demonstrate {{efforts to protect}} and repatriate victims. However, {{the government did not}} demonstrate proactive efforts to identify trafficking victims. While the government did not operate victim shelters or provide other victims services directly, it {{continued to}} fund an NGO shelter for child trafficking victims in Gabu, providing about $16,000 to the annual operating budget of the facility. Police continued to refer victims to that NGO shelter, as well as a shelter operated by a separate NGO in Bafata. The government continued efforts, as allowed under Guinea- Bissau law, to intercept and return victims domestically and repatriate victims from abroad. The government, together with the Government of Senegal and the Bissau-Guinean Embassy in Dakar, repatriated 43 children during the reporting period. As part of the repatriation process for talibés, parents must sign a contract with the regional court accepting responsibility for the safety of their children, and can be subject to criminal sanction should the children be trafficked again. The government held some child victims in transition shelters until it could successfully reunite them with family and ensure that the family would not be involved in the child’s <b>re-trafficking.</b> No special protections are afforded to witnesses. Police coordinated their repatriation efforts with NGOs, in the last year referring 160 victims to NGO providers of victim services. Victims were frequently too young to contribute meaningfully to any prosecution. However, the government encouraged family members of the victim to assist in any investigation or prosecution of trafficking offenders. Given the widespread cultural acceptance of sending young boys away from home for a religious education, family members often were reluctant to support law enforcement efforts against traffickers.|$|E
40|$|Although {{there is}} {{consensus}} among different actors regarding the seriousness {{and significance of}} <b>re-trafficking</b> as a problem, there has been very little research conducted into its incidence, cause or consequence. This research paper, funded by United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking (G/TIP), aims to address this gap through an exploratory analysis of known <b>re-trafficking</b> cases in the Human Trafficking Database of the International Organization for Migration (IOM). It is a rare look at the issue of <b>re-trafficking,</b> drawing upon a regional sample of 79 known cases of <b>re-trafficking</b> in the database. The report examines {{a number of factors}} a means to better understand and tackle the issue of <b>re-trafficking.</b> These include the individual characteristics of (re-) trafficking victims, their experiences during and post-exit from trafficking, issues on return to their country of origin, and assistance and reintegration needs. The report findings reveal that many existing reintegration programmes for victims of trafficking are not effectively tackling the economic realities faced by victims post-rescue. Assistance options should be better tailored to address the complex needs of trafficked persons if <b>re-trafficking</b> is to be avoided. The report offers a number of recommendations, concluding that it is only by finding sustainable ways to challenge the wider economic inequalities, both global and local can counter-trafficking efforts be truly effective...|$|E
40|$|Human {{trafficking}} is a transnational {{phenomenon and}} it {{has been one of the}} most hotly debated issues in the development agenda for the last decade. This thesis focuses the attention on the phenomenon of women trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and takes as a case study the Republic of Albania. Albania has been, especially during the 90 s, widely touched by the phenomenon, and since the phenomenon of trafficking has been acknowledged by the Albanian government and the international community, many projects have been launched, both at a national and international level. During the years, social services have been implemented in order to give emotional and psychological support to the women. However some reported cases shows that after a period of rehabilitation and re-integration, within the Albanian society, some of the women ones more fall into another trafficking situation. This is called <b>re-trafficking.</b> This work aims to give an understanding of the phenomenon of trafficking and <b>re-trafficking</b> through a social workers ’ point of view by applying a gender perspective to the analysis. Within the case study, eight semi-structured interviews with social workers were conducted and six interviews with key-informants wer...|$|E
40|$|The Philippines’ {{social and}} {{economic}} complexities limit the life choices of its people and migration has become the only perceived method to achieve upward {{social and economic}} mobility. Filipinos are being ‘groomed’ to migrate as a ‘culture of migration’ has become ingrained in the national psyche, creating a desperation to migrate which makes the poorest Filipinos prime targets for human traffickers. The aim of this research project {{was to investigate the}} driving factors behind the culture of migration of the Philippines and the implications for trafficking. Underpinned by a qualitative methodology, fieldwork was conducted over five months in Manila and Samar Island in the Philippines. The findings of this study show that poverty and inequality form the context which forces Filipinos to leave their hometown and the factors which make them vulnerable to trafficking are correlated with endemic corruption and the resulting lack of law enforcement. Additionally the findings revealed that recruitment practices which exploit migrants, including the betrayal of neighbours and kin, have become common practices leading to people being trafficked in poor villages. When trafficking survivors are repatriated they often find the same constraints persist. Hence they are left with no choice but to migrate again and risk being <b>re-trafficked.</b> This thesis concludes that the vulnerabilities inherent in poverty are exacerbated by a complex culture of migration which makes poor Filipinos desperate to accept any offer to migrate and, thus, exposes them to human traffickers...|$|R
40|$|Foreword: Once a trafficked {{person has}} exited an exploitative situation, they may require support {{to return and}} reintegrate into their chosen community. Using data {{contained}} in the International Organization for Migration Counter Trafficking Module, the recovery, return and reintegration experiences of Indonesian victims of human trafficking are examined in this paper. Understanding these experiences has important benefits in developing {{a better understanding of}} what assists returnees to recover and may decrease the likelihood of <b>re-trafficking.</b> Better monitoring and evaluation of return and reintegration programs will ensure that the most effective options are developed to assist victims based on the articulated needs and wants of trafficked people...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} legal framework regulating {{the problem of}} human trafficking contains the presumption that the return of victims of human trafficking to their countries of origin is the standard resolution for their cases. However, victims might have legitimate reasons for not wanting to go back. For those victims, resort to the legal framework of the European Convention on Human Rights could be a solution. I elaborate on the protection capacity of Article 3 when upon return victims face dangers of <b>re-trafficking,</b> retaliation, rejection by family and/or community and when upon return {{in the country of}} origin victims could be subjected to degrading treatment due to unavailability of social and medical assistance. In light of Rantsev v. Cyprus and Russia case, I develop an argument under Article 4 that states cannot send victims to those countries which do not meet the positive obligations standard as established in the case. Article 8 could be relevant, first, when the level of feared harm in the country of origin does not reach the severity of Article 3 but is sufficiently grave to be in breach of the right to private life and engage the non-refoulement principle, and second, when the victim has developed social ties within the receiving state and the removal will lead to their disruption...|$|E
40|$|The UK {{has joined}} with other governments in {{addressing}} trafficking in source countries. Such cooperation {{has focused on}} raising awareness among communities at risk of trafficking about the dangers that trafficking poses; supporting efforts to address {{the root causes of}} trafficking, for example, through the promotion of girls' education; and coordinating with law enforcement agencies to facilitate the prevention, deterrence and prosecution of those involved in trafficking. In November 2004, for example, the UK government and the government of Nigeria signed a memorandum of understanding on cooperation to prevent, suppress and punish trafficking in persons. The nongovernmental organization (NGO) community in the UK is actively addressing trafficking. Both agencies that focus exclusively on trafficking and those that specialize in asylum and migration have dedicated significant time, resources and energy to understanding the problem, assisting victims and advocating for systemic reform with government both at the local and national levels to ensure an effective, holistic approach to the issue that puts the rights of victims at its center. Fundamentally, trafficking will not end, and likely will continue to increase, unless effective strategies are developed that prevent communities at risk from becoming vulnerable, that protect and assist trafficking victims so that they are safe from retaliation from their traffickers and are not at risk of <b>re-trafficking</b> or other abuses, and that bring the full force of the law against traffickers to send a strong message that those who engage in this crime will be fully prosecuted. Trafficking cannot be addressed through the lens of migration control. Interception efforts will only drive traffickers elsewhere and will do little to protect their victims. It is a human rights problem that deserves the full condemnation of and concerted and integrated response from the international community. Key Recommendations Put the rights and the protection needs of trafficked persons at the center of any effort to combat trafficking. Ensure that trafficked persons have full information about, and access to, the asylum system, including consideration of whether they are at risk of <b>re-trafficking.</b> Develop a new protection mechanism for trafficked persons, including a three- to sixmonth reflection period and temporary or permanent residence for trafficked persons who cannot be returned to their homelands safely. Such mechanisms should not be contingent on cooperation with law enforcement authorities. Support through national funding the creation of safe house programs that can assist trafficked persons with accommodation, food, counseling services, health care and protection from traffickers. Such services should not be contingent on cooperation with law enforcement authorities. Ensure effective information sharing and integrated strategies among law enforcement, immigration and social services agencies to combat trafficking. Such efforts must be local, national, regional and international in scope to ensure their effectiveness...|$|E
40|$|This study aims {{to focus}} on the {{challenges}} behind the reintegration process of trafficking survivors in their families and communities in Bangladesh. In doing so, this research tries to explore the experiences of trafficked survivors {{in the process of being}} trafficked, their life in brothel and returning to Bangladesh. In addition, it helps to understand the perception of survivors in their reintegration along with the perceptions of community people and family members. This study also brings forth in discussion how their experiences in brothel and challenges to reintegration have affected their construction of identity. This research was carried out with the help of BNWLA and it intends to find out what BNWLA is doing to reduce those challenges. This study is consisted of 12 in-depth interviews with trafficking survivors, two focus group discussion with community people, some interviews with survivors’ parents and BNWLA key persons. The data was collected in June-August and analyzed the data using two different theories: Empowerment theory and Stigma theory. Thematic approach has been used to analyze data. The study findings show that reintegration of survivors is challenging. Shelter home provides facilities to the survivors to recover themselves. It takes long time to recover psychologically for the survivors and they lose the self interest to return to community. Self stigmatization of survivors becomes severe when they start living in community. BNWLA is working to change people’s mind about the reintegration of survivors and provide facilities to the survivors to get empowered. However, the empowerment of survivors is not easy due to poverty and stigma imposed by the community people. This study recommends to increase the awareness among people about survivors’ reintegration. BNWLA should be more strategic to ensure sustainable sources of income that will stop the survivor <b>re-trafficking.</b> Government, donor agencies and other NGOs should collaborate with each other to strengthen the anti-trafficking program and facilitate the reintegration of survivors...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the amount}} of ongoing {{intensive}} research, tumor cells have continued to outwit us {{in the effort to}} combat and prevent cancer by exerting a number of mechanisms to evade and suppress anti-tumor immune responses. The present work employs strategies to generate a synthetic extranodal immunoplatform that can harbor both exogenously provided and endogenously recruited immune cells (primed against tumor cells), at the same time providing immuno-factors that support these cells and counter immunosuppressive effects from tumors. We have developed injectable self-gelling alginate formulations for this purpose, enabling sustained release of soluble immunomodulatory factors from the gels and presentation of immobilized immunostimulatory factors inside the gels. The hydrogels injected into the back flanks of mice formed a macroporous structure that allowed easy cell infiltration and migration. Modulation of the mechanical properties of self-gelling alginate was possible by varying the number of calcium-bound microspheres in the gels. During characterization of immune responses using these hydrogels, alginate gels carrying activated dendritic cells (DCs) were shown to dramatically increase the number of T cells recruited to the local injection site. When the dendritic cells were pulsed with antigen, these 'vaccination nodes' were able to initiate an antigen-specific immune response, with some of the injected DCs migrating to the regional lymph nodes and priming cognate T cells. The activated antigen-specific T cells then migrated to the injection site and infiltrated the gels, causing an effector <b>re-trafficking</b> phenomenon that guided both T cells and host dendritic cells to the gels. (cont.) Taking advantage of this phenomenon, the ability of the vaccination nodes to serve as a peri-tumoral local therapy against established tumors was tested using an ovalbumin-expressing B 16 FO subcutaneous melanoma model. When mice bearing 7 -day established small tumors (- 3 mm 2 diameter) were immunized using alginate carrying activated DCs, a mild tumor suppression effect was observed. The anti-tumor effect was augmented by supplementing IL- 15 superagonist (IL- 15 SA) into the gels, which caused suppression of larger tumors (- 20 - 50 mm 2), treated 14 days after tumor cell inoculation, and enhanced survival of the mice. In addition to showing therapeutic benefits against established tumors, the matrix-based approach allowed analysis of cells that trafficked locally near the tumor site. The ease of encapsulating factors and the injectable, non-invasive nature of the self-gelling alginate open up possibilities for use in other tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications. by Yuki Hori.
