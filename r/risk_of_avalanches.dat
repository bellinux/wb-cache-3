500|$|Only {{members of}} a {{national}} UIAA club are allowed to climb the peak on their own. Other visitors {{have to take a}} certified mountain guide. The two easiest routes, usually up the Velická próba and down the Batizovská próba named after their respective valleys, are protected by chains. Because of an exposed section along the Velická próba and tricky orientation especially on the ridge, both are among the more difficult scrambling routes in the High Tatras, although it's rather climbing, since there are many moments when one must rely on ones hands to hold ones bodyweight. With no snow, guidebooks grade the routes as a II or III climb (UIAA scale) or lower. The total elevation gain is about [...] for those who spend the night at the Sliezsky Dom Hotel or are driven there by a mountain guide, and about [...] for those who hike from Tatranská Polianka. In winter, Gerlachovský štít offers a challenging alpine climb, with mixed climbing and a <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>avalanches.</b>|$|E

2500|$|El Castillo is {{the most}} popular route up the volcano. This route is usually climbed December to February and June to September. This route {{involves}} climbing {{the west side of the}} volcano. The route starts at Whymper hut to a saddle above El Castillo. From the saddle, there is a glacier ridge then you go to the Veintemilla summit. Veintemilla summit is often the turnaround point for climbers. There is a 30-minute snow filled basin between Veintemilla summit and Whymper summit. Whymper summit is the highest point of the mountain. The El Castillo route takes around eight to twelve hours to ascend and about three to five hours to descend. Climbing Chimborazo is dangerous due to <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>avalanches,</b> the severe weather conditions, and the fact that it is covered in glaciers. Climbing should begin at night in order to reach the summit before sunrise when the snow melts increasing the chance of avalanche and rockfall. The climb itself demands skill. The climb is often on black ice in which crampons and other high tech climbing equipment are required. On November 10, 1993 three parties of climbers, one ascending and two descending, were caught in an avalanche on the steep slopes below the Veintimilla summit. This avalanche buried ten climbers in a crevasse at [...] These climbers comprised: six French, two Ecuadorans, one Swiss, and one Chilean. After the ten climbers were buried in snow, it took twenty people and ten days to find their bodies. This is considered the worst climbing accident in Ecuador to date.|$|E

50|$|To {{mitigate}} the hazard <b>of</b> <b>avalanches,</b> social interventions {{reduce the incidence}} and prevalence <b>of</b> human <b>avalanche</b> involvement by modifying the behavior of people, so that their use <b>of</b> <b>avalanche</b> terrain is adapted to prevent their involvement in avalanches.

Surveys <b>of</b> <b>avalanche</b> accidents have observed that most avalanches that involve people are caused by people, and of those victims many were unaware <b>of</b> the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>avalanche</b> occurrence. To address this observation, introductory awareness and education programs provide instruction in the avoidance <b>of</b> hazardous <b>avalanche</b> involvement through the recognition <b>of</b> <b>avalanche</b> terrain, the observation of snow pack instabilities, and the identification of human activities that cause avalanches.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the field}} <b>of</b> <b>{{avalanche}}</b> warning and avalanche protection, {{the usage of}} free area (non-avalanche-secured terrain) is of high importance and was hardly estimated so far. During the winter 2004 - 05 different methods to survey and to count people in the free area were tested in the Davos area. Two methods prove to be rather efficient surveys: the light barriers and the voluntary registration boards. During the winter 2005 - 06, two light barriers and three voluntary registration boards were operated at four different sites in Davos, Switzerland. These surveys provided a good dataset, the first of this type for the Alps. They are {{the basis of our}} investigations regarding the behavior of backcountry and off-piste recreationists. This study showed a high sensitivity of the backcountry recreationists to the avalanche danger level. Off-piste recreationists were more sensitive to good snow conditions than backcountry recreationists. Our surveys about the usage of free area enable us to calculate the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an <b>avalanche</b> accident more precisely. The individual <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> an <b>avalanche</b> accident for off-piste snow sport was calculated as 7 x 10 - 5 and for backcountry snow sport as 3 x 10 - 5 per year, which is both slightly smaller than the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> driving by car. The surveys will be continued in the future to study the variability between different years...|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the climate}} change natural {{disasters}} expects to increase and in some areas the conditions for dissemination of hazardous pollutants from contaminated areas could be affected. Different inventories and mapping {{has been made to}} identify areas <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> for flood or avalanche around the country.

This essay aims to investigate what data material that is available regarding MIFO objects, flood- and avalanche risks in Ljungans run of area in Västernorrlands county. Also to investigate if there are MIFO object that is in <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> flooding and/or <b>avalanche</b> in the selected area and if so how they are prioritized today.

40|$|Raindrop {{motion is}} {{affected}} by several factors; {{one of which is}} wind speed during the rain. This study is aimed to investigate that impact by using mathematical simulation with Fortran and Matlab. Raindrops arrive on the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface at their terminal velocities which depend on their size. Raindrop falling motion could be analyzed with net force equation (Newton 2 ̆ 7 s second law). In order to determine velocity and position equations as a function of time, coefficients in those equations were fitted and compared toraindrop model developed by Boxel in 1997. In this study, equations used are fitted to both large and small size raindrops. Values resulted by equation for large size drops agreed with experimental data. Wind speedcauses the terminal velocities of raindrops to get larger, and so does their kinetic energy. In that condition, raindrops fall with certain inclination angle. The stronger wind speed, the larger raindrops 2 ̆ 7 inclination angle and their kinetic energy are when hitting soil surface. Therefore it increases the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> soil erosion at place where the soil is unstable. Through this study, speed and direction of raindrop when hitting soil surface could be investigated in order to decrease the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> <b>avalanche</b> at high <b>risk</b> area...|$|R
