50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> feeders/ <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> valves {{are used}} in {{pneumatic}} conveying systems, dust control equipment, and as volumetric feed-controls.|$|E
50|$|The basic {{use of the}} <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> feeder is as an airlock {{transition}} point, sealing pressurized systems against loss of air or gas {{while maintaining}} a flow of material between components with different pressure and suitable for air lock applications ranging from gravity discharge of filters, rotary valves, cyclone dust collectors, and <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> storage devices to precision feeders for dilute phase and continuous dense phase pneumatic convey systems.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> valves {{are also}} widely used as {{volumetric}} feeders for metering materials at precise flow rates from bins, hoppers, or silos onto conveying or processing systems.|$|E
50|$|Rotary feeders, {{also known}} as <b>rotary</b> <b>airlocks</b> or <b>rotary</b> valves, are {{commonly}} used in industrial and agricultural applications as a component in a bulk or specialty material handling system. Rotary feeders are primarily used for discharge of bulk solid material from hoppers/bins, receivers, and cyclones into a pressure or vacuum-driven pneumatic conveying system. Components of a rotary feeder include a rotor shaft, housing, head plates, and packing seals and bearings.Rotors have large vanes cast or welded on and are typically driven by small internal combustion engines or electric motors.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> feeders have wide {{application}} in industry wherever dry free-flowing powders, granules, crystals, or pellets are used. Typical materials include: cement, ore, sugar, minerals, grains, plastics, dust, fly ash, flour, gypsum, lime, coffee, cereals, pharmaceuticals, etc.|$|E
50|$|The blow-thru <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> feeder {{is ideal}} for {{pneumatic}} conveying applications in food, grain, chemical, milling, baking, plastics and pharmaceutical industries. The blow-thru airlocks feature a low profile with large capacity. High pressure differentials integral mounting feet, and retrofit competitive units. The blow-thru valves are available with 10-vane open-end rotor; outboard bearings and replaceable shaft seals.|$|E
50|$|Drop through <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> feeders are {{designed}} for rugged applications that require an outboard bearing style unit where contamination and /or an abrasive product cannot be handled with an inboard bearing style.The outboard bearing feeders is engineered for use in high pressure pneumatic conveying systems, with high temperatures where more of an effective seal is required due to high or excessive wear that is experienced with a simple dust collector.|$|E
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> feeders {{are very}} often {{installed}} to dose material in a pneumatic conveying line. As a consequence, {{a lot of}} gas coming from the conveying line is brought upstream by {{the rotation of the}} valve and the leakages in between the rotor and the stator. In order to have a functional system and a good flow of material, a small hopper equipped with a filter is very often connected to the feeder. The air can then be vented and the product admitted to the valve.|$|E
50|$|Trickle valves, {{also known}} as vacuum valves, are {{commonly}} used in industrial dust collection applications to maintain an airlock seal on a dust collector hopper while allowing bulk solid material to be automatically discharged. These valves are typically a less expensive alternative to more commonly used rotary airlocks. Unlike <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock</b> valves which are driven by either an electric motor or a gas or air-powered motor, trickle valves require no external power source and are therefore well-suited for use in mechanical trenchers, where a dust-free environment in the pinnacle truss and axle bore is required for smooth operation. Trickle values were originally developed for this purpose.|$|E
40|$|A {{fluidized}} bed gasification (FBG) pilot plant {{was designed and}} constructed at the University of Saskatchewan Chemical Engineering Department Fluidization Laboratory. FBG is a thermo-chemical method for converting solid biomass to a gaseous fuel, termed syngas. Several instrumentation and control issues were particularly challenging with this pilot plant, including development of the fuel feeding system, pressure measurement of high temperature fluids, and metering of steam as a process reactant. The fuel feeding system was tested using MBM (meat and bone meal) to determine the output rate stability, and predictability and measurability of the system as the components in the fuel feeding system were integrated. The fuel feeding system that was tested included a 150 mm primary metering screw conveyor, a 150 mm <b>rotary</b> <b>airlock,</b> and a 50 mm secondary injection screw conveyor. Each component of the system was fitted with a 3 -phase electric motor and a variable speed drive {{to allow for a}} variable output rate. The weighing system that was integral to the metering conveyor was tested as well, but upon pressurizing the metering conveyor and hopper, the weighing system sustained an unreasonable amount of noise. Integrating a pneumatic injection nozzle with the injection conveyor was found to work effectively both under ambient temperatures and hot FBG conditions up to 725 oC. Above 725 oC, {{it was found that the}} test fuel would char and coat the nozzle, causing it to plug. Testing of the feeding system with the injection nozzle removed illustrated that the system could work well without it. It was determined that the injection conveyor speed to metering conveyor speed ratio that should be used for this system was 1 : 110 for absolute rotational speeds, or 1 : 1 of the full conveyor speeds. The complete system, including the injection nozzle, was analyzed and determined to produce a fuel output rate (FS) for % speeds from 5 - 25 %, which roughly corresponded to the desired plant fuel feed rate of 1 - 5 g/s. Techniques for remote pressure measurement of {{fluidized bed}}s were examined as well, including the use of long tubes to cool hot gases and filters for blocking solid particles. The pressure measurement delay of these techniques was examined in comparison to a direct local measurement. This was conducted by comparing the pressure readings from two identical sensors; one mounted directly to a manifold, and the other mounted via a variable assembly (comprised of a variable length of 6. 35 mm (1 / 4 ") PE tubing and a porous plate filter). Assemblies without a porous plate were found to have a minimal delay of up to 0. 303 seconds for 30 m length of PE impulse tubing. More significant delays were found for systems using both a 10 media grade porous plate filter and impulse tubing; a 3 m tube length with filter has a delay of up to 0. 221 s, and a 30 m impulse tube combined with the filter has a measurement delay of up to 1. 915 s, a significant delay in cases where high-frequency analysis of pressure is used for bed agglomeration prediction, or systems where fast response is required to changing pressure conditions. Additionally, a steam flow measurement system using an orifice plate and differential pressure sensor was installed and calibrated. By collecting time-based steam samples and process data, the physical system coefficients were determined for this system, allowing for steam flow measurement, accurate within 5 % over a flow range of 0. 5 to 2. 0 g/s...|$|E
