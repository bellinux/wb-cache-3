A model was used to simulate results of different kinds of experiments for different levels of futile cycle. The main predictions of the model were experimentally confirmed in a strain with a mutant phosphofructokinase- 2 (phosphofructokinase- 2 *) which is not inhibited by MgATP. The intracellular fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate concentration reaches significantly higher levels in the mutant-bearing strain than in strains with either phosphofructokinase- 1 or - 2. Also, this strain showed a higher rate and level of in vivo radioactive labelling of fructose 1, 6 -bisphosphate, from a trace of [U- 14 C]glucose supplied during gluconeogenesis, indicating higher kinase activity in these conditions. Cell <b>resuspensions</b> of the mutant-bearing strain produced higher levels of radioactively labelled CO 2 when supplied with [U- 14 C]glycerol as the only carbon source. Simultaneously, fewer glycerol carbons were incorporated into HClO 4 -insoluble macromolecules. Finally, radioactive CO 2 output was measured in <b>resuspensions</b> supplied with glycerol as the major carbon source with traces of either [1 - 14 C]glucose or [6 - 14 C]glucose. It was found that, whereas in the strains with either of the wild-type phosphofructokinase isoenzymes, radioactive CO 2 output from [1 - 14 C]glucose was higher than with [6 - 14 C]glucose, the reverse is found for the strain with phosphofructokinase- 2 *. This result also agrees with the corresponding prediction of the model. Using the radioactivity flux rates predicted by the model, an explanation linking the futile cycle to the differential labelling of CO 2 is advanced. Finally, {{on the basis of these}} results it is proposed that strains bearing phosphofructokinase- 2 * sustain higher rates of futile cycling during gluconeogenesis than strains bearing either of the wild-type isoforms of phosphofructokinase.

50|$|Indicator {{species are}} {{also known as}} {{sentinel}} organisms, i.e. organisms which are ideal for biomonitoring. Organisms such as oysters, clams, and cockles have been extensively used as biomonitors in marine and estuarine environments. For example, the Mussel Watch Programme is a world-wide project using mussels to assess environmental impacts on coastal waters. Their well-documented feeding habits, stationary condition and their role as integral parts {{of the food chain}} are some of the main reasons why oysters and mussels are widely used biomonitors. A considerable amount of contaminant concentrations are found in the surficial sediments (i.e. the finer-grained particulate matter, usually muds, silts or clays) of marine and estuarine environments. A major physical process governing the transport of fine particulate material and associated particle-bound contaminants in estuarine environments is <b>resuspension.</b> Strong winds create surface waves, which, in shallow water (<5m), project energy to the water-sediment interface resulting in <b>resuspension</b> of fine sediment from the upper layers of the estuary floor. Once in suspension, fine material may be transported by tidal currents {{to other parts of the}} estuary and possibly to the ocean during multiple reworking phases. Mussels and oysters are filter feeders and therefore uptake is by ingestion of particulates in the water column. Sediment <b>resuspension</b> is thus very important in the bioaccumulation process which aids the evaluation of possible adverse biological effects of sedimentary contaminants in marine and estuarine environments.|$|E

To improve our knowledge of the ecological status and ecosystem functioning of transitional waters, investigations were carried out in Italian lagoons in the Po Delta and elsewhere (Marano-Grado, Goro, Comacchio, Pialassa Baiona, Lesina and Orbertello), applying the same procedures in accordance with National and International protocols. Nutrient concentrations were measured in water and top sediments and the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton and macrophytes was determined so that the trophic and ecological status could be described also by applying the Macrophyte Quality Index. Although the nutrient load was, on average, similar to that of other lagoons with better status, the overall conditions of Po Delta lagoons were found to be poor or bad, as highlighted by the absence of seagrasses and sensitive macroalgal species. Comparing all considered lagoons, the main factors affecting ecosystem recovery seem to be episodic high nutrient inputs, resulting from changes in river outflows, and huge sediment <b>resuspensions</b> caused by human activities.

Although {{the preservation of}} siliceous frustules {{is of paramount importance}} in the implementation of biotic indices, only few studies quantified treatment-induced cell losses. We assumed that commonly used treatments may lead to mechanical (centrifugation, sedimentation, boiling, sonication and mounting in Naphrax) and chemical (cold H 2 O 2 digestion) damages on diatoms. We analysed the potential adverse effects of these treatments and the cleaning efficiency of H 2 O 2 and incineration in order to find out the most suitable technique to process lightly silicified Mediterranean populations. Results showed that successive <b>resuspensions</b> of material after each concentration treatment (sedimentation and centrifugation) and low speed centrifugation did not alter the physical integrity of frustules. In contrast, boiling and sonication exhibited adverse effects especially on the preservation of large frustules and Naphrax mounting proved to be the most damaging step whatever the size of diatoms. For cleaning treatments, incineration provided the most satisfactory results and acted on a non-selective way as opposed to hydrogen peroxide which led to either a large number of non-cleaned frustules or dissolved valves.

The lamellar diffraction data from hydrated oriented multilayers of SR vesicles showed monotonically increasing widths for higher order lamellar reflections, indicative of simple lattice disorder within the multilayer. A generalized Patterson function analysis, previously developed for treating lamellar diffraction from lattice-disordered multilayers, was used to identify the autocorrelation function of the unit cell electron density profile. Subsequent deconvolution of this autocorrelation function provided the most probable unit cell electron density profile of the SR vesicle membrane pair. The resulting single membrane profile possesses marked asymmetry, suggesting that {{a major portion of}} the Ca++ -ATPase resides on the exterior of the vesicle. The electron density profile also suggests that the Ca++-dependent ATPase penetrates into the lipid hydrocarbon core of the SR membrane.

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the field}} of {{clinical}} mycobacteriology, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) can be a difficult organism to manipulate due to the restrictive environment of a containment level 3 (CL 3) laboratory. Tests for rapid diagnostic work involving smears and molecular methods do not require CL 3 practices after the organism has been rendered non-viable. While it has been assumed that after organism deactivation these techniques can be performed outside of a CL 3, no conclusive study has consistently confirmed that the organisms are noninfectious after the theoretical 'deactivation' steps. Previous {{studies have shown that}} initial steps (such as heating /chemical fixation) may not consistently kill MTB organisms. Methods An inclusive viability study (n = 226) was undertaken to determine at which point handling of culture extraction materials does not necessitate a CL 3 environment. Four different laboratory protocols tested for viability included: standard DNA extractions for IS 6110 fingerprinting, crude DNA preparations for PCR by boiling and mechanical lysis, protein extractions, and smear preparations. For each protocol, laboratory staff planted a proportion of the resulting material to Bactec 12 B medium that was observed for growth for 8 weeks. Results Of the 208 isolates initially tested, 21 samples grew within the 8 -week period. Sixteen (7. 7 %) of these yielded positive results for MTB that included samples of: deactivated culture <b>resuspensions</b> exposed to 80 °C for 20 minutes, smear preparations and protein extractions. Test procedures were consequently modified and tested again (n = 18), resulting in 0 % viability. Conclusions This study demonstrates that it cannot be assumed that conventional practices (i. e. smear preparation) or extraction techniques render the organism non-viable. All methodologies, new and existing, should be examined by individual laboratories to validate the safe removal of material derived from MTB to the outside of a CL 3 laboratory. This process is vital to establish in house biosafety-validated practices with the aim of protecting laboratory workers conducting these procedures. </p...|$|R

Our {{objective was to}} characterize reactions of Fe(II) with important metal oxides, using a suite of complementary tools to investigate the extent and underlying mechanisms of Fe(II) -metal oxide redox activity. Nanoscale materials (1 - 100 nm) may have fundamentally different surface or electronic properties than larger solids. Goethite was synthesized with primary particle dimensions above or below the nanoscale. Despite large differences in particle surface area, goethite nanorods and microrods had similar net Fe(II) sorption and electron transfer properties. Experimental evidence suggested particle aggregation resulted in particle complexes of a similar size, meaning considerations of available reactive surface area could explain our results. Kinetics and extent of Fe(II) -Fe(III) redox reactions between aqueous Fe(II) and goethite were examined using a stable isotope tracer approach. Aqueous Fe(II) that had been enriched in 57 Fe was mixed with isotopically-normal goethite. Convergence of Fe isotope ratios in aqueous and solid phases to values predicted by complete Fe atom exchange provided evidence that all goethite Fe(III) atoms could eventually react with Fe(II), despite no evidence for complete atom exchange from bulk measurements of the aqueous or solid phase. Fe isotope data at different experimental conditions was combined with theoretical considerations governing electron transfer in goethite to provide evidence for redox-driven atom exchange involving bulk conduction of electrons between spatially distinct Fe(II) sorption and release sites. Procedures for stable Fe isotope tracer studies have been adapted to investigate redox transformations of magnetite solids with different divalent cation content. Evolution of aqueous Fe(II) -Mn(IV) redox reactions was examined using complementary techniques.

40|$|The {{precipitation}} and {{dissolution of}} iron and sulfur minerals has a primary influence on water quality of acid sulfate affected landscapes (Fanning et al. 2002; Nordstrom 2000). The two key processes involved are the microbially mediated reduction and oxidation of sulfate and iron (Peine et al. 2000), which drive the geochemical store and flux of acidity. Iron sulfide minerals are the dominant store of acidity in sediments subjected to relatively stable reducing conditions (Fanning et al. 2002). However, we have found abundant elemental sulfur in the near-surface sediments of acid sulfate affected drain sediments that are subject to seasonally fluctuating water tables and redox conditions. In these drain sediments, elemental sulfur occurs as sub-micron crystals in association with contemporary monosulfidic oozes. Elemental sulfur is generally most abundant in the upper-most sediment layer (i. e. 10 - 20 mm beneath the surface) at the sediment-water boundary. Its concentration diminishes dramatically with sediment depth, indicating {{that it is not}} stable under reducing conditions and is forming at the slightly oxic sediment-water interface. Elemental sulfur is known to have a potentially important role in the digenic transformation of precursor iron monosulfides to pyrite (Berner 1984).

If disturbance of these soft sediments occurs, particularly through human interaction like shellfish harvesting, dredging, or the introduction of toxins the environment may drastically change. If this occurs, and marine biota are removed from the environment, erosion can occur, or increase, especially in regions prone to wave action and tidal <b>resuspension</b> (Bernal P., and P.M. Holligan 1992).|$|E
