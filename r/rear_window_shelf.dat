50|$|The Airtemp {{was more}} {{advanced}} than rival automobile air conditioners by 1953. It was operated by a single switch on the dashboard marked with low, medium, and high positions. As the highest capacity unit available at that time, the system was capable of quickly cooling the passenger compartment and also reducing humidity, dust, pollen, and tobacco smoke. The system drew in more outside air than contemporary systems; thus, reducing the staleness associated with automotive air conditioning at the time. Instead of plastic tubes mounted on the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> package <b>shelf</b> as on GM cars, small ducts directed cool air toward {{the ceiling of the}} car where it filtered down around the passengers instead of blowing directly on them, a feature that modern cars have lost.|$|R
50|$|Side {{windows were}} not {{existent}} in open cars, {{which may have}} detachable side screens, or manually or power-operated glass side windows as in a saloon or sedan. <b>Rear</b> <b>windows</b> have evolved similarly, with plastic <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> appearing {{as late as the}} first-generation Porsche Boxster. Contemporary convertibles and retractable hardtops feature heatable glass <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> to maximize visibility - though <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> often can compromise visibility by their size, as with the case of the very small <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> and restricted visibility of the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder. Plastic windows can degrade, fade, yellow, and crack over time, diminishing visibility.|$|R

5000|$|A rare {{option for}} the Phantom was a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> Monterey-Salinas Transit and King County Metro {{are the only two}} transit {{authorities}} known to have ordered Phantoms with a <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b>|$|R
5000|$|They {{have also}} been {{extensively}} applied to <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> as well, where legislative measures have not banned such use. For instance in Sweden that is the normal place to put them and the bumper sticker is actually called [...] "bakrutedekal" [...] (<b>rear</b> <b>window</b> decal).|$|R
50|$|In 1970 a {{flow-through}} ventilation system, where vents {{were added}} towards {{the rear of}} the car (on the exterior under the <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> on the 142 and 144 and as a grille next to the right side taillight of the 145) and electrically defrosted <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> were introduced. The split <b>rear</b> side <b>window</b> on the 145 became one piece which was no longer possible to open.|$|R

50|$|The Ami {{was offered}} in saloon and break (estate) body styles over two generations, the Ami 6 and the Ami 8. The later Ami 8 {{fastback}} saloon featured a steeply raked <b>rear</b> <b>window,</b> {{in contrast to}} the earlier reverse-raked <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> of the Ami 6 notchback.|$|R

50|$|In 1957, Mercury {{introduced}} the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, featuring a roofline with a retractable <b>rear</b> <b>window.</b> From 1958 to 1960, the feature made its {{return on the}} Continental Mark-series line, with a reverse-slant <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> (on both hardtops and convertibles). For 1963, Mercury re{{introduced the}} feature as an option for the Monterey; to streamline production, elements of the window design were shared with Ford station wagons. From 1963 to 1966, the optional reverse-slant roofline with retracting <b>rear</b> <b>window</b> was unique to Mercury, featured by no other American brand.|$|R

5000|$|The Mercury-exclusive 410 cuin L and the 428 cuin L FE engines {{were added}} for 1966. The 1966 model two door Mercury Monterey hardtop, {{was built in}} two half-year variants.

50|$|For 1952, {{the model}} names Eagle, Wing and Ace {{were used for}} cars that had the six-cylinder F-head Hurricane engine and the Aero-Lark had the six-cylinder {{flathead}} Lightning engine.

50|$|Ford imports all Transit Connects as {{passenger}} vehicles with <b>rear</b> <b>windows,</b> <b>rear</b> seats, and rear seat-belts {{to circumvent the}} 25% tariff on imported light trucks. The vehicles are exported from Turkey on cargo ships owned by Wallenius Wilhelmsen Logistics, arrive in Baltimore, and are converted into commercial vehicles at WWL Vehicle Services Americas Inc. facility: <b>rear</b> <b>windows</b> are replaced with metal panels and rear seats removed (except on wagons). The removed parts are recycled.|$|R
