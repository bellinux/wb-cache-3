5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after the equaliser United won another corner, again taken by Beckham. He landed {{the ball on the}} head of Sheringham who nodded it to Solskjær who in turn toe-poked it into the roof of the net. Oliver Kahn, the Bayern goalkeeper, was motionless on the line. United had completed the come-back. Bayern barely had time to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> which referee Collina brought to a close just a few seconds later.|$|E
5|$|Jumpscares {{are present}} {{in all of the}} series' main games, and occur when any animatronic manages to reach and attack the player-{{character}}. Most jumpscares involve an animatronic character suddenly appearing in the player's view, followed by a loud, bellowing sound. Some jumpscares, including those of Golden Freddy, Nightmare, and Nightmarionne, consist of a single screen supplemented with shrill, distorted audio. These jumpscares usually crash or <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> The player can utilise the tools listed above to prevent attacks, thus preventing any jumpscares from occurring.|$|E
5|$|Kings was {{recorded}} by the Opies as common in eastern England. The English Dialect Dictionary recorded much {{the same in the}} nineteenth century. The earliest recorded instance the Opies found was in Sternberg's 1851 Dialect of Northamptonshire. Queens is recorded as used in the kings area, sometimes as an alternative and sometimes as indicating readiness to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> Kings truce is found in Thomas Dekker's The Honest Whore, Part One (II,i), which appeared in 1604. The term is used in the play to halt a quarrel.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the android}} has {{completed}} the puzzles, Elohim gives it {{the opportunity to}} join him. If the player selects this option, then the android fails the required [...] "independence check", and a new iteration of its AI is created and forced to start the puzzles anew (effectively <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for <b>the</b> player). Alternatively, if the player leads the android to a secret entrance in the tower, the android becomes one of Elohim's messengers, but again <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> for <b>the</b> player.|$|R
50|$|Assuming {{there are}} no mistakes, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> will {{continue}} in sequence up to 21. The player who calls 21 suffers a heavy drinking penalty (e.g. finishing their drink), creates a new rule, then <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from 1.|$|R
50|$|Rocket Knight (Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, Steam) - Entering {{the code}} {{at the main}} menu will {{temporarily}} unlock the two bonus character skins. Quitting and <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> will reset <b>the</b> locks on the skins.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} game's release in North America, a game-breaking glitch was {{discovered}} in the Nintendo 3DS version: saving the game in specific Escape sections would corrupt the saved game's data, forcing the player to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from the beginning. In response, Aksys Games recommended that players avoid saving during Escape sections. By 2013, Aksys Games announced that the glitch had been patched in the Nintendo eShop version, but some players continued to report that the glitch still existed.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} online {{in the same way}} as over the board, but some aspects are unique to online bughouse. In games over the board, {{communication}} is heard by all players, while in online bughouse it is usually done via private messages between two partners. This makes communication a more powerful weapon. It is also easier to coordinate as the second board is more visible on the screen than over the board. The time aspect is altered due to existence of premove and lag. The latter can influence the diagonal time difference significantly, and it is good sportsmanship to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> when this difference gets too large.|$|E
5|$|Defeating monsters earns the {{character}} experience points, and after earning enough points, {{the character}} will gain an experience level, improving their hit points, magic capability, and other attributes. Monsters may drop treasure to be looted. On the other hand, the character dies {{if they lose}} all their hit points. As most roguelikes feature the concept of permadeath, this represents {{the end of the}} game, and the player will need to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with a newly made character. Roguelikes are nearly always turn-based, with the game only reacting when the player makes an action with the character. This allows players to evaluate a difficult situation, such as being cornered by several monsters, at their own pace and determine the best strategy.|$|E
50|$|If {{this was}} not input correctly, <b>the</b> player <b>restarted</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from <b>the</b> beginning. If the player input the {{password}} correctly, they were shown the end credits which consisted of a procession of the enemies from <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> <b>The</b> password is MERRYCHRISTMAS.|$|R
5000|$|The {{side that}} is awarded <b>the</b> penalty <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with a kick or scrum at their discretion. If a kick is taken, {{the side that}} the penalty was awarded against must retreat 10 metres (or to their goal line if closer). There are four ways of <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> game; ...|$|R
50|$|Players must {{balance their}} {{schedules}} {{in order to}} raise their character's statistics and pass school examinations. During play they encounter non-player characters and befriend them, aiming to find romance. <b>Restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> after completion enables players to unlock additional endings.|$|R
5|$|Reviewers {{were divided}} in their {{opinions}} of the Escape sections. Edge and Wallace thought that the Escape sections were satisfying to solve, while Robinson did not find them fun. Boosinger called them dull and uninspired, but appreciated their connections to the game's mathematical and scientific themes. Several reviewers noted that the controls for both the Nintendo 3DS and the PlayStation Vita were awkward and oversensitive, and Molie L. Patterson of Electronic Gaming Monthly found the limited camera movement disappointing as well. Kemps commented that the user interface was improved from Nine Hours, Nine Persons, Nine Doors. Many reviewers praised the flowchart for not forcing the player to replay previously completed sections or <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from the beginning, but Boosinger and Edge criticized it for removing the tension of making wrong decisions.|$|E
5|$|Small gold goat statues {{are hidden}} in the game's world. Collecting this allows the goat to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with various {{modifiers}} in play, such as changing the goat model to a demon goat, a giraffe, or an ostrich, or adding a jetpack to the goat that can be activated at any time. Various easter eggs are scattered about the sandbox, such as a castle where one can become the Queen of all Goats, or where the goat character gains a move similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's spin attack. The game's lead developer Armin Ibrisagic noted after release that the game's setting is a parody {{of the concept of}} Purgatory, having left references to Heaven and Hell that were later found by fans. Ibrisagic also noted the inclusion of some elements based on the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (ingame this was actually a small protest of people holding nonsensical or obscene signs).|$|E
5|$|The {{events were}} precipitated by an {{incident}} in the previous meeting between the two teams, when Ottawa's Martin Havlat had swung his stick at Mark Recchi's head. Just under two minutes {{before the end of}} the game, enforcers Donald Brashear of the Flyers and Rob Ray of the Senators engaged in a fight. As they skated off to the penalty box, Brashear became involved in another scrap, and the rest of the players on the ice for each team, including goaltenders Robert Esche and Patrick Lalime began to fight. On both of the next two face-offs to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> further fights occurred. The first of these angered the Flyers management, who believed that the fights were deliberately unbalanced against their players.|$|E
5000|$|When a foul occurs, {{there are}} two main ways of <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> One way is a bully, with the non-offending team having [...] "Heads". Alternatively, for more serious offences, a kick can be given, which is similar to a free-kick in football.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in [...] "New Game+" [...] {{mode and}} using the [...] "material scanner" [...] mode now {{available}} on the scanner at the start, the player can find their dead body that was otherwise blending into the terrain in [...] "distance scanner" [...] mode.|$|R
500|$|When a unit {{falls in}} battle, they are {{subjected}} to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the campaign unless <b>the</b> player <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from a previous save file. [...] Some character deaths, such as those of Eirika and Ephraim, end <b>the</b> <b>game</b> and require a restart from a save file.|$|R
5|$|Escaping {{the castle}} is made {{difficult}} by shadow creatures {{sent by the}} Queen. These creatures attempt to drag Yorda into black vortexes if Ico leaves her {{for any length of}} time, or if she is in certain areas of the castle. Ico can dispel these shadows using a stick or sword and pull Yorda free if she is drawn into a vortex. While the shadow creatures cannot harm Ico, the game is over if Yorda becomes fully engulfed in a vortex; the player restarts from a save point. The player will also restart from a save point if Ico falls from a large height. Save points in the game are represented by stone benches that Ico and Yorda rest on as the player saves the game. In European and Japanese releases of the game, upon completion of the game, the player has the opportunity to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in a local co-operative two-player mode, where the second player plays as Yorda, still under the same limitations as the computer-controlled version of the character.|$|E
5|$|The game {{keeps track}} of the player's {{completed}} percentage of the storyline, increased by viewing the scenarios comprising each Episode. If 100% {{of the game is}} completed, an additional ending will be unlocked. The game features a fork in its plot, allowing the player to make a choice that changes what scenes they see and the number of percentage points they acquire afterward. It is impossible to see all of the game's content on a single playthrough, due to this fork in the storyline, although it is possible to achieve 100% storyline completion in a single playthrough. However, a 100% storyline completion can only be achieved through one of the two possible storylines. When the game is completed for the first time, it unlocks a New Game Plus option that allows the player to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with all of the items, Garment Grids, dresspheres and storyline completion percentage achieved previously. However, all character levels are set back to one.|$|E
5|$|The player takes {{control of}} the Gunhed Star Fighter through nine {{vertically}} scrolling areas. The player's mission is to destroy the Dark Squadron and its eight enemy Super Weapons. Every area contains one or more bosses, all of which must be destroyed before continuing in the game. Players lose a life if they are hit by an enemy or projectile, with the game continuing at a previously–crossed checkpoint, unless they grab a flashing orb which destroys all on-screen enemies and allows them to continue {{at the point where}} their previous ship was destroyed (represented by the icon illustrating the remaining number of ships turning gold). The game ends when all lives have been lost, but the game awards 1-ups when the player scores a particular number of points. The game provides four continues in which players can <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> at that level in which their previous game ended provided the system is not turned off.|$|E
50|$|Games {{consist of}} two 15-minute periods. To start <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> a face off is {{taken on the}} centre line. Each team is {{required}} {{to be in their}} own half prior to the ball being pushed. After each goal, <b>the</b> non-scoring team <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> with a face off on the centre line.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to get to un-winnable situations which require <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game,</b> such as killing important characters who would otherwise have given you certain quests or objects. Killing random peasants is not as dangerous, as staying {{the night at the}} inn will make them forget your trespasses.|$|R
25|$|Play stops when a try is scored, {{the ball}} crosses the side line or dead ball line, or an {{infringement}} occurs. After a team scores points, <b>the</b> other team <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> at <b>the</b> halfway with a drop kick towards the opposition. The {{team with the}} most points at the end wins <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R
5|$|Each level {{contains}} various {{obstacles and}} enemies {{that the players}} must deal with. Players lose a segment from their snake if they are hit by an enemy, and they lose a life if their snake runs out of segments. Players can also lose a life if their snakes fall too far, the timer runs out, their snakes touch a sharp object, or if they are squashed by an object from above. Also, if they remain in some bodies of water for too long, a shark will attack. The game ends if players lose all their lives, but they have several continues {{in which they can}} <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> from where they left off. Players can defeat enemies by hitting them with their tongues or by jumping on them. They can collect various items to help them along during gameplay, such as items that extend the length of the snakes' tongues, extra lives and continues, time bonuses, invisibility diamonds, and items that speed up or reverse the direction of the snakes. Located throughout the game are lids (in the shape of manhole covers) in which players can open to uncover Nibbly Pibbleys, items and extra lives, entrances to bonus levels, and sometimes enemies. Also located in the game are hidden warps which allow players to skip several levels and restart at a later point in the game.|$|E
25|$|In November 2016, {{organizers}} {{announced their}} intent to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> in North Carolina in January 2018. However, in March 2017, additional news reports {{indicated that a}} revival of the game is unlikely, as a key supporter of the proposal, North Carolina governor Pat McCrory, left office {{at the start of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|Mass Effect: Andromeda is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} {{game in which}} the player takes control of either Scott or Sara Ryder from a third-person perspective. Both Ryders' appearances and first names can {{be determined by the}} player. The appearance of their father, Alec, is automatically adjusted based on the appearance of the Ryder twins. Upon beating the game, a New Game+ is unlocked, which allows the player to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with certain bonuses and switch to playing as the other Ryder, if desired. Players can also choose to continue playing with their existing character and complete unfinished missions.|$|E
5000|$|After {{reaching}} an ending, the player has <b>the</b> option of <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{to try to}} [...] "save the homeland" [...] again, possibly achieving a different ending. Upon <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> year the player may keep the money and animals earned. Each time the player finds a new ending, it gets saved in the Endings List, and the player receives the profiles of the villagers involved in that ending.|$|R
50|$|Throw-off: A throw-off {{takes place}} {{from the center}} of the court. The thrower must touch the middle line with one foot, and all the other {{offensive}} players must stay in their half until <b>the</b> referee <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b> <b>The</b> defending players must keep a distance of at least three meters from the thrower until the ball leaves his hand. A throw-off occurs at the beginning of each period and after the opposing team scores a goal. It must be cleared by the referees.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> {{procedure}} for <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> clock following a penalty by the offense will change if the penalized {{team has a}} lead {{in the last two}} minutes of either half. Before this season, <b>the</b> <b>game</b> clock would have been restarted in this situation once the ball was declared ready for play; it now will not start until the ball is snapped.|$|R
500|$|The player {{advances}} through 12 levels (called [...] "waves"), {{the first}} nine of which require Jones to travel through the palace and recover the Sankara Stones. In these stages, the player may <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> with all items intact in the last area reached. Afterwards, if the player dies, they must return to the Chamber of Kali (Wave 9) and finish the game from that point. Each level also has a timer that goes from 99 to zero. If time runs out, the player is confronted by Mola Ram and loses one life and all of their items. All levels also contain mine cart rooms, where Jones can ride the rails through the levels across hazards and past enemies.|$|E
500|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} Ninja Gaiden game, the player controls Ryu Hayabusa {{through a series of}} platforming levels called [...] "Acts". Players have the ability to jump and latch on and off walls and ladders. Two new abilities that Ryu can do in Ninja GaidenII are climbing up and down walls and attacking with [...] "Power Boosting Items" [...] while on walls and ladders. Ryu has a strength meter on top of the screen that decreases whenever he takes damage from enemies. The player loses a life if Ryu's strength meter runs out, Ryu falls off the screen or if the timer runs out; the game ends if players lose all their lives. The player can continue and <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{from the beginning of the}} level in which they lost all their lives.|$|E
500|$|Jason and SOPHIA have {{separate}} power meters, and they decrease whenever they sustain damage by an enemy {{or any other}} hazardous object or whenever Jason falls from a high place. Players can replenish these power meters by collecting power capsules that appear throughout the game. [...] Also, the player can replenish Jason's health to full at any time by re-entering SOPHIA. The player loses a life if either power meter runs out, and the game ends when all lives are lost. Players get five continues {{that allow them to}} <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> at the same level in which they have lost all their lives. A [...] "hover gauge" [...] monitors the amount of thrust remaining in SOPHIA and is located {{on the left side of}} the screen above the power meter; additional thrust can be obtained by collecting hover capsules.|$|E
25|$|Ultimately, the Traveller {{reaches the}} galaxy's centre, finding another Atlas Interface. The Traveller {{presents}} the Interface with the Atlas Stones they have obtained, {{upon which the}} Atlas creates a new star and solar system, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to <b>restart</b> <b>the</b> exploration. The current Traveller is released, free to explore on its own, while from the player's view, they are placed in control of this new Traveller, effectively <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game.</b>|$|R
50|$|Most {{methods of}} <b>restarting</b> <b>the</b> <b>game</b> {{do not permit}} the scoring of an own goal direct from the restart; if the ball crosses the goal line a corner is awarded instead. This {{is the case for}} the kick-off, goal kick, dropped-ball (since 2012), throw-in, corner kick, and free kick (indirect and direct). Such {{incidents}} are extremely rare.|$|R
5000|$|In The Five Doctors, Borusa {{has once}} again regenerated, now portrayed by Philip Latham, and is {{dissatisfied}} with ruling Gallifrey. Desiring the secret of [...] "perpetual regeneration" [...] from Rassilon, he <b>restarts</b> <b>the</b> <b>Game</b> of Rassilon, using the Timescoop to have the Doctors and their companions play it for him. Borusa is given immortality as a living statue.|$|R
