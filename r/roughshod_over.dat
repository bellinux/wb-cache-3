5|$|As it {{is clear}} that the demands of his job are taking a toll on Chris, Carla becomes {{increasingly}} uncomfortable with the brutal competition among firms and the violence they incite in other countries. Seeking an escape from Shorn and to save their marriage, Carla, with the help of her father, who lives in the London Zones, and her mother in Sweden, secures a position at the United Nations as an Ombudsman, a sort of outside auditor/investigator who attempts to enforce the UN's mandate across the world. This position is viewed as honourable but ultimately ineffective as neither the US nor UK recognise the UN's authority and run <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> them in their pursuit of profits. After an initially frosty meeting, Chris' conditions are agreed on, but with the requirement that he stay in place at Shorn through the end of the current conflict in Cambodia, in which Shorn is backing a rebel leader.|$|E
5|$|However, Bo's {{campaign}} {{was criticized for}} running <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> judicial due process and eroding the rule of law. Individuals targeted in the campaign were arbitrarily detained by the authorities, with an estimated 1,000 being sent to forced labor. Lawyers for the accused were intimidated and harassed, and {{in at least one}} case, sentenced to 18 months in prison. Allegations also surfaced over the use of torture to extract confessions. Moreover, assets seized during the campaign were allegedly redirected to help pay for Bo's popular social housing programs. The Wall Street Journal reported that $11 billion went into government coffers through the campaign. Li Jun, a fugitive businessman, asserted that he became a target of Bo anti-corruption drive {{as a result of a}} land dispute with the government. When he refused government demands to give up the land, he claims that he was abducted and tortured, and that $700 million worth of assets in his business were seized.|$|E

5|$|The corps, part of Georg-Hans Reinhardt's Third Panzer Group, {{was located}} at Kalinin, 160km (100mi) {{northwest}} of Moscow. It was worn out, {{at the end}} of a long and tenuous supply line (Model had been promoted on 28 October, and needed two weeks just to get to Kalinin), and the cold weather was starting to hamper the Germans. Nevertheless, morale remained high, and the final push towards Moscow began shortly after his arrival. Model was a whirlwind of energy, touring the front and exhorting his troops to greater efforts: he also ran <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the niceties of protocol and chains of command, and, in general, left his staff trailing in his wake. By 5 December, XLI Panzer Corps' 6th Panzer Division had reached Iohnca, just 35km (22mi) from the Kremlin. There, the advance stopped, as the winter took hold. Temperatures dropped 20 to 40°C below zero, weapons and vehicles froze solid, and the Germans were forced to call a halt to offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The second {{episode in}} Bismarck's {{unification}} efforts occurred in 1866. In {{concert with the}} newly formed Italy, Bismarck created a diplomatic environment in which Austria declared war on Prussia. The dramatic prelude to the war occurred largely in Frankfurt, where the two powers claimed to speak for all the German states in the parliament. In April 1866, the Prussian representative in Florence signed a secret agreement with the Italian government, committing each state to assist {{the other in a}} war against Austria. The next day, the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt assembly presented a plan calling for a national constitution, a directly elected national Diet, and universal suffrage. German liberals were justifiably skeptical of this plan, having witnessed Bismarck's difficult and ambiguous relationship with the Prussian Landtag (State Parliament), a relationship characterized by Bismarck's cajoling and riding <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the representatives. These skeptics saw the proposal as a ploy to enhance Prussian power rather than a progressive agenda of reform.|$|E
25|$|To {{take the}} {{pressure}} off the infantry, Schustekh charged again, just as Thierry's lost dragoons showed up. At first, the attack went well, but then the Austrian horsemen came up against a mass of cuirassiers. The result was a rout of the Habsburg cavalry, who rode {{through the ranks of}} their own foot soldiers. The French chasseurs and cuirassiers rode <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the troops of Thierry and Mesko, cutting down the fugitives. Over 3,000 Austrians became prisoners, including Thierry, and four cannon were lost.|$|E
50|$|In December 1630, {{the king}} was {{confident}} that he had secured himself {{on the coast of}} Germany. Desiring to reach out west, he had a number of reasons for doing so: he wanted to restore his cousins to their duchies in Mecklenburg (whose territories had been taken from them by Ferdinand and given to Wallenstein for his services); to establish a firm connection with the duke of Hesse-Kassel (who was the only prince at the time that had provided support to the Swedish - he was essentially the only wholehearted ally that he had in Germany;, to reach Magdeburg (if at all possible); reach out to the duke of Saxe-Lauenburg who had assured him that he would be received warmly (only if he reached his duchy); and to establish contact with Lübeck and Hamburg. Although this route, with Magdeburg in mind, was indirect, it was the only route he could take without passing through Electorate of Saxony and the Electorate of Brandenburg (which was also {{in the hands of the}} same family that possessed Prussia). These princes, desiring to maintain the integrity of their dominions and their ostensible neutrality (the Imperialists had forced them to allow armies to march through their territories on several occasions, and would do so again) did not want armies, especially Imperial armies, marching through their territories and destroying their land. These two German powers were also Protestant. They were awaiting events to see who would gain the upper hand, and they too were duplicitous in their dealings with both sides. Both of their princes were just as suspicious of the Swedes as they were of the Imperialists. They were both powerful German states, and could not be and rode <b>over</b> <b>roughshod</b> the way Pomerania had been. The king was accordingly more cautious in his dealings with them and courted them with the desire of attaining an alliance with them.|$|R
5000|$|Game 1 at the HP Pavilion {{ended in}} a 2-1 San Jose victory as the Sharks {{executed}} a physical forechecking gameplan and outshot the Oilers 30-16. In Game 2, the Sharks entered the ice to a cheer that eclipsed 109 decibels, and they rode their fans' emotion to another slim 2-1 victory. The Sharks had taken a two-game lead in the series, but were now missing Milan Michalek, one of their best offensive forwards. Michalek had been blasted in open ice by Oilers' forward Raffi Torres in Game 2. When the teams returned to Rexall Place for Game 3, the Edmonton crowd exploded; the noise in the building eclipsed 114 decibels as the Oilers came onto the ice. The Oilers parlayed the noise into inspired play, running <b>roughshod</b> all <b>over</b> the ice and outshooting the Sharks 15-2 {{by the end of}} the first period. Sharks goaltender Vesa Toskala held tough, however, and the Oilers only took a 1-0 lead into the first intermission. By the third period, the Sharks had taken a 2-1 lead, and it stood until Torres tied the game with a wrist-shot as he came down the wing. The game went into overtime, and the Sharks nearly ended it on a 2-on-1 rush, as Thornton passed to Cheechoo for the shot, but Dwayne Roloson dove across the crease and sniped the puck out of mid-air. The game finally ended in the third overtime, as the Oilers' top line of Horcoff, Hemsky and Smyth worked a passing play into the San Jose crease, where Horcoff jammed the puck in the San Jose goal for the Edmonton win. In Game 4 in Edmonton, the Oilers were trailing 3-2 in the second period when Sergei Samsonov's penalty expired and he was sent in alone on Toskala. To everyone's shock, Toskala came charging out of the net to get the puck before Samsonov. Toskala lost the puck and Samsonov slid a backhand into the open net to tie the game. The Edmonton crowd exploded in delight, and the Oilers never looked back, cruising to a 6-3 win. Game 5 in San Jose was the site of an unfortunate incident: the American feed of the Game 4 broadcast in Edmonton had picked up background noise during the playing of the American National Anthem. San Jose fans had thought it was booing, and in Game 5, a majority of San Jose fans booed the entire Canadian National Anthem. The game itself saw the Oilers carry over the momentum they gained from Game 4, and they struck for three powerplay goals and one shorthanded goal en route to another 6-3 win. In Game 6 in Edmonton, the Edmonton crowd loudly cheered the singing of the American anthem, and then joined anthem singer Paul Lorieau in a throaty and passionate rendition of [...] "O Canada." [...] The Oilers picked up where they had left off in the previous game - they stymied the Sharks' high-scoring forwards and Dwayne Roloson made 24 saves for his first career playoff shutout as the Oilers eliminated the Sharks in six games. The Oilers had earned a trip to the Western Conference Finals for the first time since 1991-92.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} round, the Oilers faced the Winnipeg Jets. The Jets proved gritty and hungry {{and took a}} big lead in the series. Trailing the series 3-1 and {{trailing}} Game Five by the identical score, the Oilers miraculously rallied to force Game Six at the Winnipeg Arena, where Kurri scored the game winner {{in front of a}} hostile Winnipeg crowd. Game Seven was won by the Oilers, 4-1. In the division finals, the Oilers met the Los Angeles Kings for the second straight season. The result would be different from in 1989, however, as Edmonton swept the series 4-0, outscoring Los Angeles 22-10. The Oilers met the Chicago Blackhawks in the Campbell Conference Finals and fell behind 2-1 in the series. In Game Four at Chicago Stadium, Mark Messier ran <b>roughshod</b> all <b>over</b> the Blackhawks, slashing, elbowing and throwing thunderous checks. Messier finished the game with 2 goals and one assist in a 4-2 Edmonton victory, and his performance has been called [...] "one of the most terrifying one-man-wrecking-crew performances in hockey history." [...] The Oilers tied the series and won the next two games, winning the series and setting up a rematch of the 1988 Stanley Cup Finals with Boston. This series will be remembered for the outstanding goaltending of Bill Ranford, and for Game One of the series which still stands as the longest Stanley Cup Finals game played in the modern NHL. Despite being soundly outshot by the Bruins, the Oilers won the game 3-2 when Petr Klima scored on a wrist shot from the right-side boards at 15:13 of the third overtime. In Game Two the Oilers were outshot 10-2 in the first period, but Ranford held tough and the Oilers led 2-1. Then Jari Kurri took over: on his 30th birthday, Kurri scored 3 goals and 2 assists in what became a 7-2 Edmonton win. In Game Three at Northlands Coliseum, the Bruins set a new NHL record by scoring ten seconds into a Stanley Cup Finals game, and never looked back in cruising to a 2-1 victory. Game Four was dominated by the Oilers' top line of Messier, Anderson and Simpson, as the trio accounted for 4 goals and 11 points in a 5-1 Edmonton victory. Game Five at the Boston Garden saw Bill Ranford stop 29 of 30 shots, and Glenn Anderson score a goal and an assist in leading the Oilers to a 4-1 win. The team had captured its fifth Stanley Cup championship in seven seasons. For his superlative goaltending, Bill Ranford was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy, but Esa Tikkanen, Kurri and Messier were all strong candidates. Simpson led the playoffs in goals with 16, and he and Messier shared the points lead with 31. The Oilers again collected multiple awards after the season. Kevin Lowe won the King Clancy Memorial Trophy for his charity work in Edmonton, and Mark Messier won the first Hart Trophy of his career. Messier's closest competition for the award was Boston's Raymond Bourque, and he edged Bourque in voting by a single first-place vote. Further proving he had stepped out of the shadow of Wayne Gretzky, Messier was selected to the First All-Star Team, over Gretzky who was named to the Second All-Star Team, in the position of centreman.|$|R
25|$|Pan {{continued}} {{to collaborate with}} Astaire {{right up until the}} latter's last musical picture, Finian's Rainbow (1968), which was a disaster on a number of fronts, not least for Pan himself. The young director Francis Ford Coppola had no prior experience with musical films, and proceeded to ride <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> Astaire and Pan's plans for the film's dance routines, reintroducing the style of dancing camera of the early 1930s which Astaire had done so much to banish from the Hollywood musical. Eventually, Coppola fired Pan, who had a small walk-on part in the film; Coppola has since acknowledged his own primary responsibility for the film's artistic failure.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{effectively}} Alsace-Lorraine was annexed: German law {{applied to}} the region, its inhabitants were conscripted into the Wehrmacht and pointedly the customs posts separating France from Germany were placed back {{where they had been}} between 1871-1918. Similarly, a sliver of French territory in the Alps was under direct Italian administration from June 1940 to September 1943. Throughout the rest of the country, civil servants were under the formal authority of French ministers in Vichy. René Bousquet, the head of French police nominated by Vichy, exercised his power in Paris through his second-in-command, Jean Leguay, who coordinated raids with the Nazis. German laws, however, took precedence over French ones in the occupied territories, and the Germans often rode <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the sensibilities of Vichy administrators.|$|E
25|$|Parnell's {{leadership}} was first {{put to the}} test in February 1886 when he forced the candidature of Captain William O'Shea, who had negotiated the Kilmainham Treaty, for a Galway by-election. Parnell rode <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> his lieutenants Healy, Dillon and O'Brien who were not in favour of O'Shea. Galway was the harbinger of the fatal crisis to come. O'Shea had already separated from his wife Katharine O'Shea, but would not divorce her as she was expecting a substantial inheritance. Mrs. O'Shea acted as liaison in 1885 with Gladstone during proposals for the First Home Rule Bill. Parnell later took up residence with her in Eltham, Kent in the summer of 1886, and was a known overnight visitor at the O'Shea house in Brockley, London. When Mrs O'Shea's aunt died in 1889, her money was left in trust.|$|E
25|$|Elagabalus {{used his}} {{authority}} to install El-Gabal {{as the chief}} deity of the Roman pantheon, merging the god with the Roman sun gods to form Deus Sol Invictus, meaning God - the Undefeated Sun, and making him superior to Jupiter, and assigning either Astarte, Minerva, Urania, {{or some combination of}} the three, as El-Gabal's wife. He rode <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> other elements of traditional religion, marrying a Vestal Virgin (who were legally required to remain unmarried virgins during their service), and moved the most sacred relics of Roman religion (including the fire of Vesta, the Shields of the Salii, and the Palladium) to a new temple dedicated exclusively to El-Gabal. As much as the religiously conservative senators may have disapproved, the lavish annual public festivals held in El-Gabal's honour found favour among the popular masses, partly on account of the festivals involving the wide distribution of food.|$|E
25|$|The {{season began}} {{in the image of}} the Broad Street Bullies era, with multiple-game {{suspensions}} handed out to five separate players, the most serious being 25-game suspensions to both Steve Downie and Jesse Boulerice for two separate incidents. A 7–3 start in October and a 9–3–1 January run had the Flyers near the top of both the Division and Conference standings. However, a disastrous ten-game losing streak in February, reminiscent of such a streak the previous season, nearly derailed the Flyers' year. An 8–3–4 run in March, coupled with two huge wins over New Jersey and Pittsburgh over the final weekend of the regular season, put the Flyers back in the 2008 playoffs as the sixth seed, setting up a first-round matchup with Washington. After taking a three games to one lead over the Capitals, Washington then won Games 5 and 6 to force a deciding Game 7 in Washington. After an evenly fought game, the Flyers ultimately won the series in overtime via a Joffrey Lupul powerplay goal. The Flyers then drew a matchup with heavily favored Montreal in the second round. Despite being outshot a majority of the series, the Flyers upset the Canadiens in five games, advancing to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time since 2003–04 to face Pittsburgh. Before the start of the series, the Flyers suffered a fatal blow when it was learned that Kimmo Timonen was out with a blood clot in his ankle. Coupled with a gruesome facial injury to Braydon Coburn in Game 2, Pittsburgh ran <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the Flyers' depleted defense and jumped out to a 3–0 series lead. The Flyers won Game 4 at home to stave off elimination, and although Timonen returned for Game 5, Pittsburgh finished off the Flyers in five games.|$|E

If you try to force him {{to do what you want}} creatively, he'll go nuclear." [...] The feud between Gilliam and the Weinsteins was eventually settled, although Bob Weinstein blamed the entire situation on yellow journalism. Filming was scheduled to end in October, but due to various problems during filming, principal photography did not end until the following 27 November.|$|E

That same month, Beatty filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles, California Superior Court seeking $30 million in damages against the Tribune and a declaration over the rights. Bertram Fields, Beatty's lawyer, said the original 1985 agreement with the Tribune was negotiated specifically to allow Beatty a chance to make another Dick Tracy film. [...] "It was very carefully done and they just ignored it," [...] he stated. [...] "The Tribune is a big, powerful company and they think they can just run <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> people.

500|$|The presidential {{election}} of 1832 was approaching, and Floyd was torn: He {{wanted to see}} Vice President Calhoun as the presidential candidate, but wondered if he should first be proposed as the vice presidential candidate for the second term. He felt Calhoun had {{a better chance to}} beat Jackson than Clay, and he wrote to Calhoun in April 1831 to know his opinion: [...] "Under all these views I really do not know which course to take; whether to announce you a candidate for the presidency and take the hazard of war, or wait the fate of Clay. We would be glad to know your opinion about these things." [...] Floyd, along with Tazewell and John Tyler, were considered the leaders of the Virginians that had become disaffected with Jackson and had turned to Calhoun. They felt that Jackson had repudiated [...] "virtue and ability as well as Old Republican tenets." [...] According to historian Stephen Oates, [...] "In Floyd's opinion, the federal government under [...] "King Andrew" [...] had usurped power left and right, thus allowing the majority to run <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the minority." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{adoption}} of the [...] "thirty-year rule" [...] in 1967 made available many of the papers of the Chamberlain government over the subsequent three years, helping to explain why Chamberlain acted as he did. The resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school, although they also included books that strongly criticised Chamberlain, such as Keith Middlemas's 1972 Diplomacy of Illusion (which portrayed Chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness {{when it came to}} Germany). Released papers indicated that, contrary to claims made in Guilty Men, Chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the Foreign Office nor had he disregarded and run <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> his Cabinet. Other released papers showed that Chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst European governments like that later advocated by Churchill, but had rejected it on the ground that the division of Europe into two camps would make war more, not less likely. They also showed that Chamberlain had been advised that the Dominions, pursuing independent foreign policies under the Statute of Westminster, had indicated that Chamberlain could not depend on their help {{in the event of a}} Continental war. The Chiefs of Staff report, which indicated that Britain could not forcibly prevent Germany from conquering Czechoslovakia, was first publicly known at this time.|$|E
500|$|Emotions ran {{high for}} many years {{following}} the [...] "Johnson County Cattle War." [...] Some considered the large and wealthy ranchers as heroes who had sought what they regarded as [...] justice by using violence to defend what they regarded as their rights to rangeland and water rights, while others saw the WSGA as heavy-handed outlaw vigilantes running <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> the law. A number of tall tales were spun by both sides afterwards {{in an attempt to}} make their actions appear morally justified. Parties sympathetic to the invaders painted Nate Champion as the leader of a vast cattle rustling empire, claiming that he was a leading member of the fabled [...] "Red Sash Gang" [...] of outlaws that supposedly included the likes of the Jesse James gang. These claims have since been discredited, however. While some accounts do note that Champion wore a red sash {{at the time of his}} death, such sashes were common. While the Hole in the Wall Gang was known to hide out in Johnson County, there is no evidence that Champion had any relationship to them. Parties sympathetic to the smaller ranchers spun tales that included some of the West's most notorious gunslingers under the employ of the Invaders, including such legends as Tom Horn and Big Nose George Parrot. Horn did briefly work as a detective for the WSGA in the 1890s, but there is little evidence he was involved in the war.|$|E
500|$|The Liberals {{concluded}} {{their campaign}} {{with a large}} rally at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on June 7. Entertainment at the event {{was provided by the}} Leslie Bell singers, and according to Grosart, many in the audience were Tory supporters who had turned out to hear them. St. Laurent's speech at the rally was interrupted when William Hatton, a 15-year-old boy from Malton, Ontario, climbed onto the platform. Hatton carried a banner reading, [...] "This Can't Be Canada" [...] with a Liberal placard bearing St. Laurent's photograph, and moved to face the Prime Minister. Meisel describes Hatton as an [...] "otherwise politically apathetic boy who... slowly and deliberately tore up a photograph of the Prime Minister as the latter was speaking" [...] and states that Hatton engaged in [...] "intensely provocative behavior". Liberal partisans interceded, and in the ensuing fracas, Hatton fell from the platform, audibly hitting his head on the concrete floor. St. Laurent watched in apparent shock, according to his biographer Dale Tompson, as officials aided the boy and took him from the hall. According to Tompson, the crowd [...] "turned its indignation on the men on the platform" [...] and spent the remainder of the evening wondering about the boy's possible injuries rather than listening to the Prime Minister's speech. Hatton was not seriously injured, but, according to Newman, [...] "the accident added to the image of the Liberal Party as an unrepentant arrogant group of old men, willing to ride <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> voters". Grosart later described the incident as [...] "the turning point" [...] of the campaign. Professor Meisel speculated that the Hatton incident might have been part of an organized campaign to annoy St. Laurent out of his pleasant [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] persona, and Grosart later related that Liberal frontbencher Jack Pickersgill always accused him of being behind the boy's actions, but that the incident was [...] "a sheer accident". Hatton's mother described his actions as [...] "ust a schoolboy prank," [...] and a reaction to reading an article about how the art of heckling was dying. According to public relations executive J.G. Johnston in a letter to Diefenbaker on June 10, Hatton had come to the rally with several other boys, including Johnston's son, but had gone off on his own while the other boys paraded with Diefenbaker posters which had been smuggled inside. According to Johnston, Hatton was caught on CBC tape saying to St. Laurent, [...] "I can no longer stand your hypocrisy, Sir" [...] before tearing the St. Laurent poster. Attempts by Johnston to have the Liberal activist who pushed Hatton off the platform arrested failed, according to Johnston, on the ground that the police could find no witnesses.|$|E

2500|$|The Nazis disliked universities, {{intellectuals and}} the Catholic and Protestant churches. According to Gill, their long term {{plan was to}} [...] "de-Christianise Germany after the final victory". The Nazis co-opted the term Gleichschaltung to mean {{conformity}} and subservience to the National Socialist German Workers' Party line: [...] "there was to be no law but Hitler, and ultimately no god but Hitler". The Kirchenkampf (Church struggle) saw the Nazis attempt to control the religious confessions of Germany. Aggressive anti-Church radicals like Joseph Goebbels and Martin Bormann saw the conflict with the Churches as a priority concern, and anti-church and anti-clerical sentiments were strong among grassroots party activists. Hitler too disdained Christianity. According to Kershaw, the German church leadership expended considerable energies in opposing government interference {{in the church and}} [...] "attempts to ride <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> Christian doctrine and values". [...] While offering [...] "something less than fundamental resistance to Nazism", church leaders [...] "engaged in a bitter war of attrition with the regime".|$|E

At what was described as a [...] "stormy" [...] Cabinet meeting on May 30, 2002, Chrétien stated that he intended to serve out his entire term, and ordered the end of all leadership fundraising. Martin left his cabinet on June 2, 2002. Martin claimed that Chrétien dismissed him from Cabinet, while Chrétien said that Martin had resigned. In his memoirs, Chrétien wrote that he regretted not having fired Martin a few years earlier. In the aftermath of Martin's departure from the Cabinet, there occurred an angry caucus meeting on June 5, 2002, where much of the caucus came out in support of Martin; demanded that he fire his much hated communications director Françoise Ducros, who many MPs claimed was impossible to work with, leading to a chorus of MPs chanting [...] "Bring back Peter, bring back Peter" [...] (a reference to Ducros's predecessor Peter Donolo); and several pro-Martin M.Ps asked forthright for Chrétien to resign. Liberal MP Dan McTeague told Chrétien that [...] "You made a decision for Paul Martin. You should make the same decision for yourself". Many of the MPs accused the PMO of riding <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> them, and accused the prime minister of being a bully. Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish recalled about that caucus meeting that she could not believe that [...] "these ungrateful sons of bitches", as she called the pro-Martin MPs, would attack Chrétien at a caucus meeting so openly. For Chrétien's reaction, Parrish stated: [...] "His face was evil. His eyes were like a shark's eyes", and she could not understand why he didn't walk out, saying [...] "Any other person would have, especially knowing that most of those assholes telling you this couldn't get elected dog catcher if they weren't on a Liberal ticket riding on your coattails".|$|E

60|$|Mr Swiveller {{was so much}} {{confounded by}} the single gentleman riding <b>roughshod</b> <b>over</b> him at this rate, that he stood looking at him almost {{as hard as he}} had looked at Miss Sally. The single gentleman, however, was not in the {{slightest}} degree affected by this circumstance, but proceeded with perfect composure to unwind the shawl which was tied round his neck, and then to pull off his boots. Freed of these encumbrances, he went on to divest himself of his other clothing, which he folded up, piece by piece, and ranged in order on the trunk. Then, he pulled down the window-blinds, drew the curtains, wound up his watch, and, quite leisurely and methodically, got into bed.|$|E
