The amount {{and composition of}} <b>refinery</b> <b>residue</b> depend on {{the purity of the}} bauxite ore and extraction conditions, and differs between <b>refineries.</b> The <b>refinery</b> <b>residue</b> is usually stored in engineered disposal areas that eventually have to be revegetated. This is challenging because of the alkaline and sodic nature of the residue. At Alcan Gove 2 ̆ 7 s bauxite refinery in Gove, Northern Territory, Australia, research into revegetation of bauxite residue has been conducted since the mid- 1970 s. In this review, we discuss approaches taken by Alcan Gove to achieve revegetation outcomes (soil capping of <b>refinery</b> <b>residue)</b> on wet-slurry disposal areas. Problems encountered in the past include poor drainage and water logging during the wet season, and salt scalding and capillary rise during the dry season. The amount of available water in the soil capping is the most important determinant of vegetation survival in the seasonally dry climate. Vegetation cover was found to prevent deterioration of the soil cover by minimising capillary rise of alkalinity from the <b>refinery</b> <b>residue.</b> The sodicity and alkalinity of the residue in old impoundments has diminished slightly over the 25 years since it was deposited. However, development of a blocky structure in red mud, presumably due to desiccation, allows root penetration, thereby supplying additional water to salt and alkali-tolerant plant species. This has led to the establishment of an ecosystem that approaches a native woodland...|$|R

The preliminary investigation of chemical composition suggested it was a lipopeptide in nature. The biosurfactant had a yield of 4.5 g/l and exhibited good surface activity, emulsification ability and can withstand high salt concentration but was not thermo stable. They later also applied sequential factorial design to optimize biosurfactant production by Candida lipolytica using soybean oil <b>refinery</b> <b>residue</b> as substrate (Rufino et al. 2008). In this study they evaluated the impact of three cultivation factors, amounts of <b>refinery</b> <b>residue,</b> glutamic acid and yeast extract. The biosurfactant product showed high surface activity and emulsifying ability and was very stable at wide range of pH (2 - 12), temperatures (0 - 120 °C) and salinity (2 - 10 % NaCl). They concluded that combination of an industrial waste and a cheap substrate is a promising approach to reduce production cost. In another study the same group (Sobrinho et al. 2008) described a low cost medium {{for the production of}} a surfactant by the yeast Candida sphaerica. The medium formulation consisted of distilled water containing 5.0 % groundnut oil <b>refinery</b> <b>residue</b> plus 2.5 % corn steep liquor as substrates. The biosurfactant product had high surface tension reducing activity (26 mN/m), a low CMC value (0.08 %) and a yield of 4.5 gl- 1. The biosurfactant characterized was an anionic glycolipid (consisting of 75 % lipid and 25 % carbohydrate) and was stable at wide temperature, pH and salt level. They concluded {{that it was possible to}} produce biosurfactants from agricultural materials and use them in potential application in oil recovery from sand. (Coimbra et al. 2009) also showed the biosurfactant production by six Candida strains cultivated in insoluble (n-hexadecane) and soluble substrates (soybean oil, ground-nut oil <b>refinery</b> <b>residue,</b> corn steep liquor and glucose). These biosurfactant were able to remove 90 % of the hydrophobic contaminants from sand.|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) in Bayer residue slurry inhibits {{the effectiveness of}} the seawater neutralisation process to reduce the pH and aluminium concentration in the residue. An increase in the slurry pH (reversion), after seawater neutralisation, is caused by the dissolution of calcium hydroxide and hydrocalumite (solid components found in bauxite <b>refinery</b> <b>residue).</b> Reversion was not observed when the final solution pH was greater than 10. 5, due to hydrocalumite being in a state of equilibrium at high pH. Hydrocalumite has been found to form during the neutralisation process when high concentrations of calcium hydroxide are present in the residue liquor. The dissolution of hydrocalumite releases hydroxyl (OH-) and aluminium ions back into solution after the seawater neutralisation (SWN) process, which causes pH and aluminium reversion to occur.

40|$|Bauxite <b>refinery</b> <b>residues</b> (red mud) {{are derived}} from the Bayer process by the {{digestion}} of crushed bauxite in concentrated sodium hydroxide at elevated temperatures and pressures. This slurry residue, if untreated, is unsuitable for discharge directly into the environment and is usually stored in tailing dams. The liquid portion {{has the potential for}} discharge, but requires pre-treatment before this can occur. The seawater neutralisation treatment facilitates a significant reduction in pH and dissolved metal concentrations, through the precipitation of hydrotalcite-like compounds and some other Mg, Ca, and Al hydroxide and carbonate minerals. The hydrotalcite-like compounds, precipitated during seawater neutralisation, also remove a range of transition metals, oxy-anions and other anionic species through a combination of intercalation and adsorption reactions: smaller anions are intercalated into the hydrotalcite matrix, while larger molecules are adsorbed on the particle surfaces. A phenomenon known as ‘reversion’ can occur if the seawater neutralisation process is not properly controlled. Reversion causes an increase in the pH and dissolved impurity levels of the neutralised effluent, rendering it unsuitable for discharge. It is believed that slow dissolution of components of the red mud residue and compounds formed during the neutralisation process are responsible for reversion. This investigation looked at characterising natural hydrotalcite (Mg 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 (CO 3) ∙ 4 H 2 O) and ‘Bayer’ hydrotalcite (synthesised using the seawater neutralisation process) using a variety of techniques including X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis.

The present study investigated the use of Bauxsol™, a modified bauxite <b>refinery</b> <b>residue,</b> to remove dissolved phosphate from water, and has shown {{that it can be}} used as a cost-effective adsorbent for treating phosphate-contaminated waters. The results provide water and environmental managers with a new technique for decreasing the phosphate loads in water and wastewater. Environmental benefits include improved water quality, minimisation of excessive plant growth, including potentially toxic blue green algae, and the utilisation of an industrial residue for environmental remediation. Abstract: Phosphate (PO 43 –) removal by Bauxsol™, a neutralised bauxite <b>refinery</b> <b>residue,</b> was investigated as a function of time, pH, ionic strength, adsorbent dosage, competing ions, and initial phosphate concentration. The results of adsorption and desorption studies indicate that adsorption of PO 43 – by Bauxsol™ is based on a ligand-exchange mechanism, although the low reversibility pH-independent desorption observed in acid-treated Bauxsol™ indicates a dominance of chemisorption. It was shown that PO 43 – adsorption onto both Bauxsol™ and acid-treated Bauxsol™ followed a Langmuir isotherm model, with adsorption capacities of 0. 21 and 0. 48 mmol g- 1 at pH 9. 0 and 5. 2 respectively. Adsorption of PO 43 – by Bauxsol™ increased with decreasing pH, with maximum adsorption efficiencies obtained at pH 5. 2 ± 0. 1 (the lowest pH investigated), higher Bauxsol™ to initial phosphate concentration ratios, and increased time. Studies of the effects of competing ions on the adsorption of PO 43 – by Bauxsol™ indicated that adsorption decreased in the presence of HCO 3 - ions, whereas SO 42 – and Cl- ions had little effect, and Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + ions increased adsorption. These findings suggest that Bauxsol™ could be used as an efficient low-cost adsorbent for treating phosphate-contaminated waters...|$|R

In order to evaluate the effect of adding the product to Portland cement (PC) pastes, fresh properties (i. e. standard consistency and slump), setting time and heat of hydration were measured. In addition, its influence on chemical changes and compressive strength was investigated. It was found that the addition of this NBRR resulted in a decrease in compressive strength beyond 7 days. The setting time decreased with an increase in NBRR content in PC pastes. The rate of heat evolution for NBRR pastes was greater than that of the PC pastes, but a corresponding increase in the quantity of calcium hydroxide was not found.

In this study, X-ray absorption spectroscopy was used to investigate the host minerals, and retention mechanisms, responsible for binding MnII, CrIII, CoII, Ni, Cu and Zn in MBRR. High metal loadings (∼ 10 mM at pH 3) in aqueous phases simulated highly contaminated mine drainage environments, whereas a final pH of 7. 5 represents the typical MBRR pH buffering providing surface loadings of 1. 7 – 2. 6 wt%. Under these conditions, CrIII precipitated as a solid phase similar to γ-CrOOH and/or amorphous Cr(OH) 3, regardless of host mineral, whereas MnII immobilization was associated with (partial) oxidation in all cases. Cobalt and Ni precipitated primarily as hydrotalcite-like solids when {{in contact with the}} MBRR, and sodalite, gibbsite and hydrotalcite tended to dominate this process. Cu uptake by MBRR resulted from the precipitation of Cu(OH) 2 although sorption processes may have made an additional contribution, whereas Zn precipitated as a solid phase similar to that of hydrozincite. The nature of the trace metal precipitate formed was often influenced by the host mineral constituent of MBRR, indicating that specific minerals in the MBRR can be primarily responsible for its metal immobilization properties, with gibbsite, hematite and hydrotalcite featuring prominently. © 2013 Elsevier B.

A combination of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrational spectroscopy techniques, including mid-infrared (IR), Raman, near-infrared (NIR), and UV-Visible, have been used to characterise bauxite residue and seawater neutralised bauxite residue. Both the ferrous (Fe 2 +) and ferric (Fe 3 +) ions within bauxite residue can be identified by their characteristic NIR bands, where ferrous ions produce a strong absorption band at around 9000 cm- 1, while ferric ions produce two strong bands at 25000 and 14300 cm- 1. The presence of adsorbed carbonate and hydroxide anions can be identified at around 5200 and 7000 cm- 1, respectively, attributed to the 2 nd overtone of the 1 st fundamental overtones observed in the mid-IR spectra. The complex bands in the Raman and mid-IR spectra around 3500 cm- 1 are assigned to the OH stretching vibrations of the various oxides present in bauxite residue, and water. The combination of carbonate and hydroxyl units and their fundamental overtones give rise to many of the features of the NIR spectra...|$|E
40|$|Tricalcium aluminate, hydrocalumite and {{residual}} lime {{have been}} identified as reversion contributing compounds after the seawater neutralisation of bauxite <b>refinery</b> <b>residues.</b> The formation of these compounds during the neutralisation process is dependent on the concentration of residual lime, pH and aluminate concentrations in the residue slurry. Therefore, the effect of calcium hydroxide (CaOH 2) in bauxite refinery liquors was analysed and the degree of reversion monitored. This investigation found that the dissolution of tricalcium aluminate, hydrocalumite and CaOH 2 caused reversion and continued to increase the pH of the neutralised residue until a state of equilibrium was reached at a solution pH of 10. 5. The dissolution mechanism for each compound has been described and used to demonstrate the implications that this has on reversion in seawater neutralised Bayer liquor. This investigation describes the limiting factors for the dissolution and formation of these trigger compounds as well as confirming the formation of Bayer hydrotalcite (mixture of Mg 6 Al 2 (OH) 16 (CO 32 -,SO 42 -) •xH 2 O and Mg 8 Al 2 (OH) 12 (CO 32 -,SO 42 -) •xH 2 O) as the primary mechanism for reducing reversion during the neutralisation process. This knowledge then allowed for a simple but effective method (addition of magnesium chloride or increased seawater to Bayer liquor ratio) to be devised to reduce reversion occurring after the neutralisation of Bayer liquors. Both methods utilise the formation of Bayer hydrotalcite to permanently (stable in neutralised residue) remove hydroxyl (OH-) and aluminate (Al(OH) 4 -) ions from solution...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{experimental}} {{designs and}} response surface methodology {{were employed to}} optimize the concentrations of agroindustrial residues as soybean oil (SORR) from refinery, and corn steep liquor (CSL) from corn industry, for tensio-active agent produced by Candida sphaerica UCP 0995. Three 22 full factorial design were applied sequentially to investigate {{the effects of the}} concentrations and interactions of soybean oil <b>refinery</b> <b>residue</b> and corn steep liquor on the surface tension of free-cell culture broth for 144 h. Two 22 central composite designs and response surface methodology were adopted to derive a statistical model to measure the effect of SORR and CSL on the surface tension of the free-cell culture broth for 144 h. The regression equation obtained from the experimental data using a central composite design was solved, and by analyzing the response surface contour plots, the optimal concentrations of the constituents of the medium were determined: 8. 63 % v/v (≅ 9 % v/v) of SORR and 8. 80 % v/v (≅ 9 % v/v) CSL. The minimum surface tension predicted and experimentally confirmed was 25. 25 mN/m. The new biosurfactant, denominated Lunasan, recovered 95 % of motor oil adsorbed in a sand sample, thus showing great potential for use in bioremediation processes, especially in the petroleum industry...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{researches}} developed with biosurfactants for application {{in the medical}} area have been revealing the promising biological activities of these biomolecules. In this work the antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties of a biosurfactant Rufisan isolated from the yeast Candida lipolytica UCP 0988, growth in a medium supplemented with ground nut <b>refinery</b> <b>residue</b> was determined against several microorganisms. The biosurfactant was able to reduce the water surface tension from 70 to 25. 3 mN/m and showed a critical micelle concentration (CMC) of 0. 03 %. The biosurfactant was isolated after 72 h of fermentation and was tested in concentrations varying from 0. 75 to 12 mg/l. The highest antimicrobial activities were observed against Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus mutans NS, Streptococcus mutans HG, Streptococcus sanguis 12, Streptococcus oralis J 22 at a concentration superior to the biosurfactant critical micelle concentration. Moreover, the biosurfactant showed anti-adhesive activity against most of the microorganisms tested. As far as we know, {{this is the first}} compilation of data on antimicrobial and anti-adhesive activities of a biosurfactant obtained from a Candida strain against such a broad group of microorganisms. The results obtained in this work showed that the biosurfactant from C. lipolytica is a potential antimicrobial and/or anti-adhesive agent for several biomedical applicationsCoordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior (CAPES) Fundação de Amparo à Ciência e Tecnologia do Estado de Pernambuco (FACEPE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{rigidity}} percolation in composite materials {{consisting of a}} dispersion of mineral particles in a microstructured viscoelastic matrix. The viscoelastic matrix in this specific case is a hydrocarbon <b>refinery</b> <b>residue.</b> In a set of model random composites the mean interparticle surface-to-surface distance was controlled, changing particle volume fraction phi and particle number density independently. This was achieved by mixing two sets of monodisperse particles with widely differing radii (0. 35 mu m and 17. 5 mu m) with the matrix. A scaling exponent of 3. 9 +/- 0. 6 for the storage modulus G' vs phi-phi(c) was observed above a threshold phi(c), in good agreement with theoretical values for rigidity percolation. It is found that at the rigidity-percolation threshold the pore structure, as characterized by the mean surface-to-surface distance for the filler, rather than the filler volume fraction, is similar for different types of composites. This behavior is explained from the internal structure of the viscoelastic matrix, which consists of fractal solid aggregates dissolved in a viscous medium; the effective radius of these aggregates and the mean surface-to-surface distance together {{determine whether or not}} the aggregates are capable of providing rigidity to the composite. The explanation is further supported by a qualitative comparison with effective-medium calculations. These indicate that the observed breakdown of time-temperature superposition near phi(c) is due to the appearance of a time scale characteristic for the mechanical interplay between the viscous binder phase and the purely elastic solid particles...|$|R
