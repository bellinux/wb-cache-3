50|$|Burrs in {{drilled holes}} cause {{fastener}} and material problems. Burrs cause more stress to be concentrated {{at the edges}} of holes, decreasing <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> and shortening fatigue life. They interfere with the seating of fasteners, causing damage to fastener or the assembly itself. Cracks caused by stress and strain can result in material failure. Burrs in holes also increase the risk of corrosion, which may be due to variations in the thickness of coatings on a rougher surface. Sharp corners tend to concentrate electrical charge, increasing the risk of static discharge. Burrs in moving parts increase unwanted friction and heat. Rough surfaces also result in problems with lubrication, as wear is increased at the interfaces of parts. This makes it necessary to replace them more frequently. Electrical charge buildup can cause corrosion.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Our study's {{objective}} was to compare <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> between endocrown and conventional post and core restorations when subjected to shear force. Materials and Methods: Thirty human mandibular premolars were extracted for orthodontic reasons, endodontically treated, and restored using three different methods: endocrown, glass fiber post and composite resin core, and metal post. All the crowns were made from IPS e. max ceramic. Shear forces were applied to these restorations using a test machine until breakage. Load and displacement were recorded every 0. 1 s. Results: No significant difference was observed in <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> between glass fiber post and metal post. No relationship between the displacement of prosthetic dental system and type of material used was uncovered and by comparing the type of fracture with the restoration material used. However, {{a greater number of}} favorable fractures were observed in the glass fiber group whereas most of the fractures in the endocrown and metal post groups were unfavorable. Conclusion: Endocrown displays better <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> compared to conventional post and core restorations. In addition, endocrown did not show more displacement or cause more unfavorable fractures than the conventional restorations. This restoration may represent a reliable alternative for restoring a damaged, endodontically treated tooth. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{stressed}} overlayers and nanoindentation {{were used}} to study the effect of elevated temperature on the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> interfacial <b>fracture</b> of gold-chromium films in hybrid microcircuits.

Stressed overlayers and nanoindentation were then used to drive interfacial delamination and blister formation. From these blisters, interfacial fracture energies were determined using mechanics-based models modified for multilayer film effects. The results clearly showed that the chromium interlayers increased interfacial fracture energy.

40|$|Air plasma sprayed {{thermal barrier}} {{coatings}} (APSed TBCs) exhibit splat microstructure formed by thin layers of lamellae (splats), and also include many interlamellar pores and voids. These microstructural features are {{primarily responsible for}} the low stiffness commonly exhibited by such coatings. The splat microstructure thus has an important influence on <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fractures,</b> such as delamination, because thermal stress in coatings depends on its stiffness.

In the present study, the correlation between the mechanical properties and splat microstructure of an APSed TBC is studied using the simple sintering model and numerical simulation (distinct element method). Numerical simulation results clarified that the mechanical properties of an APSed TBC were controlled by the splat microstructure, which varied depending on the sintering mechanism.

For this purpose 40 bovine inferior incisors were utilised, which were randomised into 4 groups; one control group and 3 experimental groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All teeth of the 3 experimental groups were sawed at 3 mm from the incisal margin, and the respective fragments were then reattached utilizing different composite resins: in group 2 _EI the hybrid composite Tetric EvoCeram (Ivoclar Vivadent AG) was used, in group 3 _ZI the hybrid composite FiltekTM Z 250 (3 M ESPE) was used, and in group 4 _SN the nanofilled composite FiltekTM Supreme (3 M ESPE) was used. After reattachment, on each tooth were performed a chamfer on the buccal surface and an overcontour on the lingual surface along the fracture line, which were then filled with the composite resin corresponding to the respective group. Finally, all teeth were embedded in plaster blocks, and a force was applied on the buccal surface.

40|$|International audienceThe {{relationship}} between composition, structure, and <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fracture</b> remains poorly understood. Here, based on molecular dynamics simulations, {{we report that}} sodium silicate glasses and calcium silicate hydrates feature an anomalous maximum in fracture toughness. In the framework of topological constraint theory, this anomaly is correlated to a flexible-to-rigid transition, driven by pressure or composition for sodium silicate and calcium silicate hydrates, respectively. This topological transition, observed for an isostatic network, is also shown to correspond to a ductile-to-brittle transition. At this state, the network is rigid but free of eigen-stress and features stress relaxation through crack blunting, resulting in optimal <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>fracture.</b> Our topological approach could therefore enable the computational design of tough inorganic solids, which {{has long been a}} ``holy grail'' within the nonmetallic materials chemistry community.
