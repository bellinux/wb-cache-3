40|$|This project {{helped to}} {{identify}} priorities {{for improving the}} safety of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants through a literature review and NASS-CDS injury analysis. The literature review covers injury patterns of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, new safety technologies intended for the <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> studies of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> belt and seat geometry, and methods for assessing belt fit; key points follow. Most rear-seat cushion lengths exceed the recommended length of 440 mm intended for accommodating adults. Since children make up 70 % of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, built-in booster seats with shorter cushion lengths designed to accommodate children aged 5 - 8 would be beneficial. Front seats tend to have steeper outboard lap-belt angles, more forward shoulder belt anchors, and narrower spacing between lap belt anchorages than in the rear seat; target lap belt angles in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> should range from 45 to 70 degrees. Booster seats are potentially more effective at mitigating poor lap belt geometry than poor shoulder belt geometry, so improving shoulder belt geometry in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> should have higher priority. Load limiters, seatbelt pretensioners, and inflatable belt systems are potential countermeasures for reducing thoracic injury for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. If load limiters are installed in <b>rear</b> <b>seats,</b> the amount of available space for occupant displacement would be more important to consider in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> than in the front seat. The NASS-CDS database was first used to identify rear-row occupant seating patterns. In the second row, adults tend {{to sit on the}} right side, but this is not true for children. Vans are the only vehicle type with substantial numbers of 3 rd row seating. The ages of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant vary substantially with driver age. Drivers aged 16 - 25 most likely have other 16 - 25 YO or 0 - 4 YO occupants in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> For drivers aged 26 - 50, 85 % of their <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants are under aged 16. Drivers over age 50 have the greatest proportion of passengers over age 50 in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> From the injury analysis, <b>seating</b> in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> is protective in terms of fatality and injury reduction, regardless of restraint use, except for rear impacts. The back of the front seat is a common injury contact point for rear-seat occupants. Studies of belt restraints have seldom found a difference in effectiveness between the front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Most common injury contact points in side impact for belted children are on the lower rear quarter of the rear window. The presence of other occupants in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> provides some benefit in injury reduction for children involved in side impacts, possibly by limiting lateral movement. Pediatric abdominal injury patterns indicate that the <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> of minivans provide an environment with lower risk of abdomen injury compared to the back seats of passenger cars and SUVs. Pediatric injury rates are similar for children riding in SUVs and passenger cars, as potential benefits of a heavier vehicle are offset by a greater tendency to be in rollovers. Presence of a three-point belt rather than a lap-only belt reduces pediatric risk of AIS 2 + injury by 81 %. The presence of a shoulder belt in the center <b>rear</b> <b>seating</b> position usually only affects seating practices when there is a single child occupant in the <b>rear</b> <b>seat...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to study}} {{the effect of the}} <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> {{structure}} on child occupant protection. According to GB 15083 - 2006 standard, a finite element model of luggage cabin and rear-row seat was developed in LS-DYNA and validated via test results. The model was used in analysis of the safety performance of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> structure under luggage impact in car frontal crashes, in order to minimize the risk of child occupant injury. A 3 years old child seat was simulated with fixing on the <b>rear</b> <b>seat.</b> Four optimization schemes were designed {{in order to reduce the}} intrusion and acceleration of the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> structure, comparing to the original model. The original model was improved via the structure optimization of <b>rear</b> <b>seat,</b> as well as the fixed positions of child seat. A verification model is developed to simulate <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> impact with combined optimization schemes. The final results from the verification model show that the intrusion and acceleration of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> structure are all much smaller than original seat model...|$|R

40|$|Though a {{significant}} {{body of literature}} exists on the safety performance and effectiveness of various types of front seat occupant restraint systems, there is a paucity of data {{on the performance of}} <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant restraint systems. A research program was initiated to better understand <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> restraint performance. Research included examining real world data using National Automotive Sampling System/Crashworthiness Data System (NASS/CDS) and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) as well as conducting full frontal vehicle crashes into rigid barriers with dummies restrained in <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b> Child dummies (Hybrid III 6 year-old) and adult dummies (Hybrid III 5 th percentile female and 50 th percentile male) were used for this purpose. The dummies were placed in <b>rear</b> outboard <b>seats</b> with lap/shoulder belts {{as well as in the}} center seating position where the lap/shoulder belts were integrated to the seat. A double-paired comparison study using FARS data files suggested that while occupants younger than 50 years of age benefit from sitting in <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in frontal crashes, restrained adult occupants older than 50 years are significantly better off in the front <b>seats</b> than the <b>rear</b> <b>seats.</b> The most injured body region for restrained children in <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> is the head while that for restrained adults is the thorax. The major injury source for restrained occupants, not in child safety seats, is the seat belts while that for unrestrained occupants is the front seat back. The injury measures of restrained adult dummies in <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> in frontal crash tests were generally higher than those of dummies of the same size in the driver and front passenger seat. The seat backs of integrated <b>rear</b> <b>seats</b> experienced excessive forward rotation in frontal crash tests, thereby causing the dummy’s head to hit the console or front seatback, resulting in high head and neck injury measures. The field and vehicle crash test data indicate that <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> restraints could be further optimized to mitigate injury in frontal crashes for older <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants...|$|R

40|$|Major {{gains in}} {{occupant}} protection in automotive crashes {{have been made}} {{over the past few}} decades, with the introduction of technologies such as airbags and seat belt pretensioners. However, the focus, both in terms of regulation and consumer testing, has been on front <b>seat</b> occupants. With <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants being over-represented in vehicle fatalities, {{there is a need to}} examine protection offered to those who sit in the back seat of motor vehicles. This thesis consists of six inter-related studies focused on characterising the rates and biomechanical mechanisms of the injury to <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants (not using child restraints), and evaluations of both existing and novel technologies for improving injury outcomes for <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants. The methods used include in-depth crash investigation and crash sled testing, with a focus on children aged 8 - 16 and older occupants. The results of these studies indicate that substantial casualty savings in <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants might be achieved through the implementation of existing technology to front seat occupants. While the results of the in-depth crash investigation demonstrated that injury mechanisms differ between front and <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, it was found from sled testing that tailoring existing technologies to meet the needs of <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupants, such as younger and older occupants, may substantially improve <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant protection. Vehicle regulation and consumer testing has previously been an effective method for driving improvements in occupant protection, and it is recommended that vehicle regulation bodies incorporate requirements for performance of the <b>rear</b> <b>seat</b> occupant protection system...|$|R
