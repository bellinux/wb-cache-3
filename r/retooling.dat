5|$|Quantico, {{initially}} {{scheduled to}} air Tuesdays at 10:00pm, {{was moved to}} Sundays at 10:00pm due to a <b>retooling</b> of Of Kings and Prophets.

5|$|Albert Bouchard {{had been}} {{completely}} excluded from the <b>retooling</b> of the album for contractual reasons, but hoped to have his long work rewarded with a credit as co-producer, and to be paid accordingly. After the disbandment of Blue Öyster Cult, he contacted the other band members {{in an attempt to}} organize a 1987 reunion tour, with the original line-up, to promote Imaginos. His economic and membership requests were both rejected, due to resistances within the label and within the band, so he filed a lawsuit in 1989 against the management of Blue Öyster Cult and Columbia Records to receive payment for his work. The lawsuit was settled out of court, but his resentment towards Sandy Pearlman for what he felt was a theft of his work never eased, eliminating any chance of future collaborations for the completion of the Imaginos saga.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} protect their vault {{in a number}} of ways, such as {{building}} walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members—by default, a wife and two children—being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting the money is the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; {{it can be used to}} purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is <b>retooling</b> it for defense.|$|E
5|$|<b>ReTool</b> {{bought and}} sold used tools. Winmark opened the first <b>ReTool</b> on November 10, 1999, in Chicago. Roughly 65% of <b>ReTool's</b> goods were {{purchased}} from people, while the remainder was purchased from factories that produced too many tools or from closing businesses. CEO John Morgan said in an October 2000 interview that many people did not sell tools they did not use so {{it was hard to}} accumulate used tools at <b>ReTool.</b> Winmark sold <b>ReTool</b> around 2002.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{demonstration}} at Remington's offices in New York, the company contracted on March1, 1873, to manufacture 1,000machines, with {{the option to}} produce an additional 24,000. Although the agreement required Densmore to give Remington $10,000 and royalty rights, a marketing firm to be formed by Densmore and Yost was allowed {{to serve as the}} exclusive sales agent. Remington dedicated a wing of its factory to the typewriter, and spent several months <b>retooling</b> and re-engineering the device; production began in September and the machine entered the market on July1, 1874. Typewriter production was largely overseen by Jefferson Clough and William K. Jenne, manager of Remington's sewing machine division. The redesigned machine was sturdier and more reliable than Sholes' model, but it had taken on some of the characteristics of a sewing machine, including a japanned case with floral ornamentation and a stand with a treadle to operate the carriage return. The typewriter, however, had been rushed into production with insufficient testing, and early models were soon returned for adjustments and repair.|$|E
5|$|GM halted {{production}} for about one {{month at the}} Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly plant by mid June 2011 to complete some upgrades, including the installation of new tooling, equipment and overhead conveyor systems throughout the facility. These upgrades allowed GM to triple the rate of Volt production and prepared the plant for 2012 Volt and Ampera production. After the plant <b>retooling,</b> the production rate reached 150 units per day {{four days a week}} by August 2011. The Volt plant was also down during January 2012 in preparation for building the California lower-emission version. A four-week shutdown due to slow sales took place between March and April 2012. GM said it had around 3,600 Volts in inventory and needed to reduce dealer inventories as production is expected to meet market demand. GM also extended the traditional two-week summer vacation by an extra week at the Hamtramck plant. GM closed its Detroit-Hamtramck plant from September 17 until October 15, 2012, affecting roughly 1,500 workers on downtime while the plant was retooled to assemble the all-new 2014 Chevrolet Impala alongside the 2013 Volt. This was the second time in 2012 that GM has halted Volt production.|$|E
5|$|The Factory No. 174 {{produced}} {{its last}} T-26 tanks in February 1941. After that, the factory began <b>retooling</b> {{to produce the}} new and much more complex T-50 light tank. This work was slowed by delays {{in the delivery of}} new equipment and series production of the T-50 did not begin on schedule (planned for 1 June 1941). As a result, factory management decided to resume the production of the T-26, using T-26 hulls, turrets, and other parts already in stock. About 47 T-26 tanks were assembled and 77 were repaired in July–August 1941 before the factory was relocated from Leningrad to Chelyabinsk in the end of August 1941, and then to Chkalov in September 1941. The Factory No. 174 produced engines and spare parts for the T-26, installed additional armour plates on some T-26s, replaced flame-throwers with 45mm tank guns in turrets of 130 KhT-133 flame-throwing tanks, repaired tanks in army units (846 T-26s since the beginning of 1941) and mounted about 75 turrets from the T-26 and the T-50 as bunkers for the defence of Leningrad.|$|E

5|$|Wicked officially {{opened on}} June 10, 2003 at the Curran Theatre in San Francisco, after previews began on May 28, in a pre-Broadway tryout {{presented}} by SHN. The cast included Kristin Chenoweth as Glinda, Idina Menzel as Elphaba, Robert Morse as the Wizard, Norbert Leo Butz as Fiyero, Michelle Federer as Nessarose, Carole Shelley as Madame Morrible, John Horton as Doctor Dillamond, and Kirk McDonald as Boq while Stephanie J. Block, who originally read {{the role of}} Elphaba in workshop development, served as an ensemble member and understudied the lead role. The tryout closed on June 29, 2003, and after extensive <b>retooling,</b> the musical began previews on Broadway at the Gershwin Theatre on October 8, 2003, and made its official premiere on October 30. Most of the original production team and cast members remained with the show, {{with the exception of}} some minor ensemble changes and the replacement of Robert Morse with Joel Grey as the Wizard, John Horton with William Youmans as Doctor Dillamond and Kirk McDonald with Christopher Fitzgerald as Boq, while Eden Espinosa and Laura Bell Bundy were added as standbys for Elphaba and Glinda respectively.|$|E

25|$|Scott {{has since}} complained {{that time and}} money constraints, along with his {{obligation}} to Thelma & Louise, kept him from <b>retooling</b> the film in a completely satisfactory manner. While he is happier with the 1992 release of the film than with the original theatrical version, he has never felt entirely comfortable with it as his definitive director's cut.|$|E
25|$|DaimlerChrysler {{discontinued}} the Neon, {{with the}} final cars assembled on September 23, 2005 at the Belvidere Assembly plant in Belvidere, Illinois. The Neon was replaced {{in the spring of}} 2006 with the 2007 Dodge Caliber, which is based on the shared Chrysler/Mitsubishi Motors GS platform. Like the Neon, the Caliber had an SRT-4 variant, but like the standard Caliber, it used a completely different engine. The Belvidere plant underwent <b>retooling</b> for the Caliber, Jeep Compass, and Patriot.|$|E
25|$|On December 20, 2012, KNTV began {{broadcasting}} Cozi TV, {{a digital}} subchannel network that airs {{a mix of}} movies, first-run lifestyle programming, and classic television series from the 1950s through the 1980s. The service is a <b>retooling</b> of NBC Nonstop (which operated a regional service called NBC California Nonstop that debuted in January 2011 on KNTV, and sister stations KNBC/Los Angeles and KNSD/San Diego), which carried news and lifestyle-oriented programs, {{some of which have}} been carried over to Cozi.|$|E

25|$|In addition, the {{proposed}} agreement would entitle Fiat {{to receive a}} further 15% (without cash consideration) through the achievement of specific product and commercial objectives. No cash or financial support was required from Fiat under the agreement. Instead it would obtain its stake mainly in exchange for covering the cost of <b>retooling</b> a Chrysler plant to produce one or more Fiat models for in the US. Fiat would also provide engine and transmission technology to enable Chrysler to introduce smaller, fuel-efficient models in the NAFTA market.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, for the 1954 model year, {{the model}} {{underwent}} a major square-lined redesign. This entailed extensive <b>retooling</b> {{because of the}} way the step-down frame wrapped around the passenger compartment. The front had a simpler grille that complemented the now-functional hood scoop and a new one-piece curved windshield, while the sides gained period-typical fender chrome accents, and the formerly sloped rear end was squared off. The front to rear fender line was styled to make the car look longer and taillamps were also redesigned. The interior was also updated with a new dash and instrument cluster that were surprisingly modern.|$|E
25|$|The {{results of}} the Austrian trials sparked a wave of {{interest}} in Western Europe and overseas, particularly in the United States, where a similar effort to select a service-wide replacement for the M1911 {{had been going on}} since the late 1970s (known as the Joint Service Small Arms Program). In late 1983, the United States Department of Defense inquired about the Glock pistol and received four samples of the Glock 17 for unofficial evaluation. Glock was then {{invited to participate in the}} XM9 Personal Defense Pistol Trials, but declined because the DOD specifications would require extensive <b>retooling</b> of production equipment and providing 35 test samples in an unrealistic time frame.|$|E
