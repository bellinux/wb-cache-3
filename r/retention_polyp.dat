40|$|A FEW {{decades ago}} {{intestinal}} polyposis {{was regarded as}} a single entity, but increasing knowledge has led to the identification of a number of different syndromes. The term polyposis coli is usually taken to mean familial adenomatosis coli, a premalignant condition occurring in adolescents and adults. Although there have been many reports of colonic polyposis in children, discussions on the subject have been confused because of the failure, until recently, to distinguish between the adenomatous polyp and the juvenile polyp. The commonest type of polyp in children is the juvenile or <b>retention</b> <b>polyp</b> which is present usually as a solitary lesion, but occasionally such polyps are multiple in the colonic mucosa and the term juvenile polyposis coli is used (Veale et al 1966). This is a rare condition: only six cases have been seen at St. Mark's Hospital, London, in contrast to 140 cases of familial adenomatosis coli (Lockhart-Mummery 1967). Nevertheless its recognition is important since it differs from adenomatosis coli in its aetiology, clinical presentation, pathology and prognosis. We wish to present a patient with juvenile polyposis coli and an associated congenita...|$|E
40|$|We {{report a}} 15 years old girl {{presenting}} with severe hematochezia with secondary anemia and hemodynamic decompensation, rectal prolapse and spontaneous anal elimination of polyps. She had no {{family history of}} polyposis and {{a search for the}} disease in her close relatives was negative. A complete diagnostic work up did not find polyps in other segments of the digestive tract. Colonoscopy showed more than 200 polyps between the cecum and the rectum. Pathological analysis confirmed the presence of <b>retention</b> <b>polyps</b> with adenomatous areas and mild atypia. The patient was subjected to a proctocolectomy with ileal pouch and sphincteric preservation, using a mechanical suture. Postoperative evolution was uneventful and after 24 months of follow up, the patient is asymptomatic, with two stool movements per day and without incontinence (Rev Méd Chile 2001; 129 : 1065 - 70...|$|R
40|$|Juvenile (<b>retention)</b> <b>polyps</b> {{are usually}} solitary lesions in the colorectum {{but may be}} {{multiple}} in juvenile polyposis. The association between juvenile polyps and colorectal neoplasia is controversial. We present three patients with juvenile polyposis who had colorectal adenomas or adenomatous epithelium in juvenile polyps at ages 3, 4, and 7 years. In a retrospective study of 57 additional patients {{with one or more}} juvenile polyps, 10 patients (18 %) had colorectal neoplasia including three with adenocarcinoma, two with tubular adenoma, and six with adenomatous epithelium in a juvenile polyp (one had both adenomatous epithelium and an adenocarcinoma). Nine of these 10 patients had juvenile polyposis defined by the presence of at least three juvenile polyps; and eight of the nine had a family history of juvenile polyps. Colorectal neoplasia occurred at young age (mean (SEM) 37 (5) years). Our findings suggest that patients with juvenile polyps who have three or more juvenile polyps or a family history of juvenile polyps should undergo surveillance for colorectal neoplasia...|$|R

40|$|Hyperplastic polyps {{represent}} the commonest polyp {{encountered in the}} stomach. They occur in patients of either gender and are commoner in the seventh decade of life. They are usually asymptomatic, small (less than 1 cm in diameter), solitary lesions occurring in the antrum but can present with dyspepsia, heartburn, abdominal pain, or upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding leading to anemia. Hyperplastic polyps almost never occur in normal gastric mucosa and are most commonly associated with chronic gastritis (Helicobacter pylori or autoimmune-induced). Pathologically, they are characterized by dilated, tortuous gastric foveoli set within an inflamed, edematous stroma. There is considerable histologic overlap especially with Ménétrier's disease and hamartomatous (juvenile or <b>retention)</b> <b>polyps,</b> and clinical input is mandatory to accomplish separation of these entities. Hyperplastic polyps arise as a by-product of repair to damaged mucosa. Dysplasia and malignancy are rarely associated with these polyps, which show an array of molecular aberrations. The importance of hyperplastic polyps for both gastroenterologist and pathologist lies in their association with other gastric mucosal pathology and mandates biopsy of adjacent mucosa and diligent search for accompanying pathology by the pathologist...|$|R
30|$|Non-symptomatic {{abnormalities}} of the maxillary sinus such as mucosal thickening, retention cysts, and opacification {{are reported to}} occur in up to 74 % of all cases [1 – 6]. For diagnosis of symptomatic pathologies of the maxillary sinus like <b>retention</b> cysts, <b>polyps,</b> and tumors, panoramic radiographies (PAN) are commonly used and widely available. In PAN, not every area of interest is accurately detected and allocated. Furthermore, small maxillary sinus lesions with diameter less than 3  mm show poor detection rates [7]. Three-dimensional imaging is useful in the maxilla {{for a wide range}} of clinical settings, such as trauma, bone pathology, and neoplastic diseases, as well as in dental implantology and sinus augmentation [8 – 12].|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To analyze {{available}} {{evidence on the}} incidence of anatomical variations or disease of the maxillary sinuses as identified by cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in dentistry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A focused question was developed to search the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Oral Health Group Trials Register, and CENTRAL and identify all relevant papers published between 1980 and January 19, 2013. Unpublished literature at ClinicalTrials. gov, in the National Research Register, and in the Pro-Quest Dissertation Abstracts and Thesis database was also included. Studies were included irrespective of language. These results were supplemented by hand and gray literature searches. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified. Twenty were retrospective cohort studies, one was a prospective cohort study, and one was a case control study. The main indication for CBCT was dental implant treatment planning, {{and the majority of}} studies used a small field of view for imaging. The most common anatomical variations included increased thickness of the sinus membrane, the presence of sinus septa, and pneumatization. Reported sinus disease frequency varied widely, ranging from 14. 3 % to 82 %. There was a wide range in the reported prevalence of mucosal thickening related to apical pathology, the degree of lumenal opacification, features of sinusitis, and the presence of <b>retention</b> cysts and <b>polyps.</b> More pathologic findings in the maxillary sinus were reported in men than in women, and the medial wall and sinus floor were most frequently affected. CONCLUSION: CBCT is used primarily to evaluate bony anatomy and to screen for overt pathology of the maxillary sinuses prior to dental implant treatment. Differences in the classification of mucosal findings are problematic in the consistent and valid assessment of health and disease of the maxillary sinus. Link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Background Diagnostic imaging of {{the head}} is used with {{increasing}} frequency, and often includes the paranasal sinuses, where incidental opacifications are found. To determine the clinical relevance of such findings can be challenging, and for the patient such incidental findings can give rise to concern if they are over-reported. Studies of incidental findings in the paranasal sinuses have been conducted mostly in patients referred for diagnostic imaging, hence the prevalence {{in the general population}} is not known. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the prevalence and size of incidental opacification in the paranasal sinuses in a non-selected adult population using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without medical indication, and to relate the results to sex and season. Methods Randomly and independent of medical history, 982 participants (518 women) with a mean age of 58. 5 years (range, 50 – 66) underwent MRI {{of the head}} as part of a large public health survey in Norway. The MRIs included 3 D T 1 weighted volume data and 2 D axial T 2 weighted image (WI). Opacifications, indicating mucosal thickenings, <b>polyps,</b> <b>retention</b> cysts, or fluid, were recorded if measuring more than 1 mm. Results Opacifications were found in 66 % of the participants. Mucosal thickenings were found in 49 %, commonly in the maxillary sinuses (29 %) where 25 % had opacifications that were less than 4 mm in size. Other opacifications occurred in the anterior ethmoid (23 %), posterior ethmoid (21 %), frontal sinus (9 %), and sphenoid (8 %). <b>Polyps</b> and <b>retention</b> cysts were also found mainly in the maxillary sinuses in 32 %. Fluid was observed in 6 % of the MRIs. Mucosal thickening was observed more frequently in men than in women (P < 0. 05). No seasonal variation was found. Conclusions In this large non-selected sample, incidental opacification in the paranasal sinuses was seen in two out of three participants, and mucosal thickening was seen in one out of two. Fluid was rare. Knowledge of incidental opacification is important because it can affect clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Background: Imaging {{abnormalities}} in the {{paranasal sinuses}} are regularly noted as incidental findings on MRI, however, {{little is known}} about their prevalence in the Iranian population. The {{purpose of this study was}} to classify these findings in the paranasal sinuses as seen on MRI and to investigate the prevalence, according to site and type of paranasal abnormality. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the T 2 -weighted axial MRI of 256 patients with diseases unrelated to their paranasal sinuses were reviewed between May 2002 and June 2003. The findings were categorized according to the anatomic location and the imaging characteristics of the abnormality. The abnormalities recorded included total sinus opacification, mucoperiosteal thickening > 5 mm, air fluid levels and <b>retention</b> cysts or <b>polyps.</b> Unilateral or bilateral involvement and septal deviation were also noted. A sinus was considered normal if it was fully aerated and no soft-tissue density was apparent within the cavity. Results: Among our cases, 111 (43. 5 %) were male and 145 (56. 5 %) were female. Of these patients, abnormalities in one or more of the sinus groups were found in 110 subjects (42. 9 %), 55. 5 % of which were male and 44. 5 % were female (P= 0. 001). Maxillary sinus abnormalities were observed in 66. 4 % of the patients, while ethmoid sinus abnormalities were found in 63. 6 %. Of the ethmoid abnormalities, 21 % were found in the anterior section, 9 % in the middle ethmoid, and 8 % in the posterior ethmoid. The most common abnormality found was mucosal thickening. Among our cases, 23. 4 % had septal deviation, which was significantly higher among those with sinusitis (29 % versus 19. 1 %; P< 0. 01). Of those patients with sinus involvement, 16 % were involved in the sphenoid sinus and 5 % in the frontal sinus. The results obtained from the patients with sinus abnormality revealed that 85 % suffered from cough, nasal obstruction, runny nose, facial pain and post nasal discharge and 24 % had been diagnosed with chronic sinusitis by physician. Conclusion: Our results showed that there was a high rate of incidental abnormalities in the paranasal sinuses that are unrelated to the patient's presenting problems...|$|R
