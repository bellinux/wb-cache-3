Mains-frequency currents follow the path of least resistance, and it is possible, especially with ageing oxidised contacts, that from a socket, the lowest-resistance live connection is along the left-hand side of the ring, and the lowest-resistance neutral connection is along the right-hand side. As a result, current is flowing around the ring and will therefore generate a magnetic field proportional to the imbalance.

We show that the so-called 'power-law' galaxies in fact have Sersic r 1 /n profiles over their entire observed radial range. Consequently, only three (Sersic-profile) parameters are required to simultaneously describe both the inner (HST-resolved) and outer profiles of low-luminosity (M > - 20. 5 B-mag) elliptical galaxies. We also find that 'core galaxies' have Sersic profiles with a (partially evacuated) single power-law core. We have developed a modified (5 -parameter) Sersic profile with a power-law core to model the complete radial extent of luminous galaxies with cores. In addition to quantifying the global stellar distribution in these systems, we have derived new estimates of their core radii (and central mass deficits) and compare these with values obtained using the (5 -parameter) Nuker model...|$|R

We take a statistical approach: distributions of galaxies from the SDSS Large-Scale Structure (LSS; spectroscopic) sample are constructed at a range of redshifts, and target galaxies are compared to these distributions. An adaptive mesh is implemented to increase {{the percentage of the}} parameter space populated by the LSS galaxies. We test the method on a subset of galaxies from the LSS sample, yielding rms ∆z of 0. 025 for red galaxies and 0. 030 for blue galaxies (all with z < 0. 25). Additional tests and future improvements for this promising technique are suggested. Subject headings: galaxies: distances and redshifts — techniques: photometric — catalogs 1...|$|R

We present strong arguments in favour of model-based parametrisation schemes, namely reliability assessment, disentanglement of morphological observables, and PSF modelling.

In particular, after introducing the (basic) <b>radial</b> <b>light</b> profiles of disk galaxies, I explain several important `structural' scaling relations and review the latest bulge-(black hole mass) diagrams. I go on to present the typical bulge-to-disk flux ratios of disk galaxies and suggest {{the use of a}} grid of bulge-to-disk flux ratio versus disk Hubble type - based {{on the nature of the}} spiral arms - to complement the Hubble-Jeans sequence. I then briefly mention pure disk galaxies before cautioning on difficulties with identifying pseudo-bulges built from secular evolution. Finally, I conclude by discussing a likely connection between modern day bulges in disk galaxies and high-redshift (z ~ 2 +/- 0. 5) compact galaxies which may have since acquired a disk via cold flows and quiescent accretion.

40|$|Parametrisation {{of galaxy}} morphologies is a {{challenging}} task, for instances in shear measurements of weak gravitational lensing or investigations of formation and evolu-tion of galaxies. The huge {{variety of different}} morphologies requires a parametrisation scheme that is highly flexible and that accounts for certain morphological observables, such as ellipticity, steepness of the <b>radial</b> <b>light</b> profile and azimuthal structure. In this article, we revisit the method of sérsiclets, where galaxy morphologies are decomposed into a set of polar basis functions {{that are based on}} the Sérsic profile. This approach is justified {{by the fact that the}} Sérsic profile is the first-order Taylor expansion of any real light profile. We show that sérsiclets indeed overcome the modelling failures of shapelets in the case of early-type galaxies. However, sérsiclets implicate an unphysical relation between the steepness of the light profile and the spatial scale of the polyno-mial oscillations, which is not necessarily obeyed by real galaxy morphologies and can therefore give rise to modelling failures. Moreover, we demonstrate that sérsiclets are prone to undersampling, which restricts sérsiclet modelling to highly resolved galax...|$|R
40|$|We analyse {{the global}} {{structure}} of the old stellar discs in 34 edge-on spiral galaxies. The radial and vertical exponential scale parameters of the discs are obtained by applying an improved two-dimensional decomposition technique to our I -band photometry. We find a clear increase in the disc scaleheight with maximum rotational velocity, in accordance with observations of the stellar velocity dispersions in galaxy discs. The range and maximum of the intrinsic flattening of the disc light seem to increase with both maximum rotational velocity and total Hi mass. We use the disc flattening to estimate the disc contribution to the maximum rotational velocity, resulting in an average of 57 +/- 22 per cent. The disc light distributions are further investigated {{for the presence of}} radial truncations. We find that the <b>radial</b> <b>light</b> distributions of at least 20 spirals are truncated, corresponding to 60 per cent of the sample.

40|$|We {{report on}} a {{complete}} CCD imaging survey of 226 elliptical galaxies in the North-East quadrant of the Virgo cluster, representative of the properties of giant and dwarf elliptical galaxies in this cluster. We fit their <b>radial</b> <b>light</b> profiles with the Sersic r 1 /n model of light distribution. We confirm the result of Graham & Guzman (2003, AJ, 125, 2936) that the apparent dichotomy between E and dE galaxies in the luminosity- 〈μ〉_ e plane no longer appears when other structural parameters are considered and can be entirely attributed to the onset of "core" galaxies at B_T ∼ - 20. 5 mag. When "core" galaxies are not considered, E and dE form a unique family with n linearly increasing with the luminosity. For 90 galaxies we analyze the B-I color indices, both in the nuclear and in the outer regions. Both indices are bluer toward fainter luminosities. We find also that the outer color gradients do not show any significant correlation with the luminosity. The scatter in all color indicators increases significantly toward lower luminosities, e. g. galaxies fainter than B_T ∼ - 15 have a B-I spread > 0. 5 mag...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} the EFAR sample of galaxies to {{investigate}} the light distributions of earlytype galaxies. We decompose the 2 D light distribution of the galaxies in a flattened spheroidal component with a Sérsic (1968) <b>radial</b> <b>light</b> profile and an inclined disc component with an exponential light profile. We show that {{if we assume that}} all galaxies can have a spheroid and disc component, that then the brightest, bulge dominated elliptical galaxies have a fairly broad distribution in the Sérsic profile shape parameter nB, with a median of about 3. 7 and a sigma of ∼ 0. 9. Other galaxies have smaller nB values. This means that spheroids are in general less concentrated than the de Vaucouleurs R 1 4 -law profile, which has nB= 4. While the result of our light decomposition is robust, we cannot prove without kinematic information that these components are spheroids and discs, in the usual sense of pressure- and rotation-supported stellar systems. However, we show that the distribution of disc inclination angles is consistent with random orientation if we take our selection effects into account.

These two examples are representative of different dust obscuration conditions, and of bulge/disk decomposition.

40|$|Abstract. Detailed neutral {{hydrogen}} observations {{have been}} obtained of the large barred spiral galaxy NGC 3992 and its three small companion galaxies, UGC 6923, UGC 6940, and UGC 6969. For the main galaxy, the Hi distribution is regular with a low level radial extension outside the stellar disc. However, at exactly {{the region of the}} bar, there is a pronounced central Hi hole in the gas distribution. Likely gas has been transported inwards by the bar and because of the emptyness of the hole no large accretion events can have happened in recent galactic times. The gas kinematics is very regular and it is demonstrated that the influence of the bar potential on the velocity field is negligible. A precise and extended rotation curve has been derived showing some distinct features which {{can be explained by the}} non-exponential <b>radial</b> <b>light</b> distribution of NGC 3992. The decomposition of the rotation curve gives a slight preference for a sub maximal disc, though a range of disc contributions, up to a maximum disc situation fits nearly equally well.
