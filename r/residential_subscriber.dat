40|$|Europe is {{experiencing}} a rapid growth in residential broadband coverage, but due to usage pat-terns and cost structures, {{only a fraction of}} the available bandwidth is actually being consumed. This implies that most <b>residential</b> broadband <b>subscribers</b> have excess capacity, and the idea of the Open Broadband Access Network (OBAN) project is that this capacity can be shared with passers-by. In order for the <b>residential</b> broadband <b>subscribers</b> to open up their networks, and for the potential wireless customers to sign up for OBAN service, the security of both parties must be ensured. OBAN needs to solve the problems posed by the fact that a visiting OBAN user and a residential access point operator have no pre-existing trust relationship. This paper describes an architecture that achieves this. In addition, the architecture ensures that all participating parties are able to prove the amount of traffic transferred in any given OBAN session. This enables a broader range of business models with respect to charging of visiting OBAN users, remuneration of <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers,</b> and cooperation between service providers.

40|$|Johansen et al. (1) have {{assessed}} {{the risk of}} cancer in Danish cellular tele-phone users. They conducted a retro-spective cohort study of cancer inci-dence in 420 095 <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers</b> compared with national cancer data and found no excess of brain cancer or other cancers of primary interest. In constructing their cohort, however, they initially identified 723 421 sub-scribers and then excluded 200 507 (27. 7 %) who were “corporate custom-ers ” because data on the individuals who used the phones were not available. While the exclusion is understandable on grounds of practicality, it introduces a potential bias. The corporate custom-ers will include many company execu-tives {{who are likely to}} be among the earliest and most extensive users of tele-phones because the individual does not have to pay the bill for long and frequent business calls. Removal of this most ex-posed group from the cohort will lessen the likelihood of finding an effect; how-ever, they will contribute to the national data used for reference. This excluded group contrasts with the residential cus-tomers who formed the cohort and for whom cost is a disincentive to use. The intensity of use of the phone by <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers</b> was not avail-able; it may have ranged from a few calls a week to nearly continuous use. Also, the extent of usage of hands-free kits by <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers</b> concerned by the publicity about brain tumors over several years was not known. These facts point to the appreciable impreci-sion of the exposure data. It is also note-worthy that the cohort excluded persons younger than 18 years of age. For these various reasons, the study should be in-terpreted carefully regarding the hypoth-esis of an association between use of cellular telephones and tumors of the brain or salivary gland, leukemia, or other cancers. The authors did note a slight increase in the risk of testicular cancer (standard-ized incidence ratio 1. 12; 95 % con-fidence interval 0. 97 to 1. 30).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{described}} the evolution of the number of <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers</b> of broadband fixed access by cable modem, in Portugal, on the period from 2000 – 2009. The pattern of evolution is estimated by fitting several models to the series, namely the following: exponential, Gompertz, Logistic, Bass and Michaelis-Menten. We fit the models to the data by nonlinear least squares, except in the exponential model where the linear version is fitted by ordinary least squares, using the internet freely available program R. This comparative study is in line with many others on the diffusion of technological innovations in the telecommunications sector, where the point is finding out if there is an early or a late take-off phenomenon. The Michaelis-Menten model is introduced for the first time in this approach. It allows to predict the later evolution in the series and reveals a qualitatively different behavior.

This simulation network uses several features to study the performances of WiMax on Triple Play services, 3. 5 GHz band is chosen in our studies because it is widely used band all over the world. Moreover, this band is licensed, so that interfere is under control and allows using higher transmission power. The best bandwidth for a carrier frequency of 3. 5 GHz is needed to be tested. The pathloss for urban, suburban and rural is calculated, while multipath with pathloss is calculated for ITU channel model of pedestrian in different environments. WiMax does not offer a compelling reason to switch from other forms of residential broadband. When bundled with broadband internet access and VoD, a WiMax Triple Play becomes very attractive to <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers.</b> Given the QoS and reliability mechanisms built into WiMax in this simulation scenario, subscribers will find WiMax good...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the phenomenal}} {{growth of the}} Internet in recent years, a number of cable {{operators}} {{are in the process}} of upgrading their cable networks to offer data services to <b>residential</b> <b>subscribers,</b> providing them direct access to a variety of community content as well as to the Internet. Using cable modems that implement sophisticated modulation-demodulation circuitry, these services promise to offer a several hundred-fold increase in access speeds to the home compared to conventional telephone modems. Initial experiences indicate that cable networks are susceptible to a variety of radio-frequency impairments that can result in significant packet loss during data communication. In the face of such losses, the TCP protocol that is predominantly used by data applications degrades dramatically in performance. Consequently, subscribers of broadband data services may not perceive the projected hundred fold increase in performance. In this paper, we analyze the performance of TCP under different network conditions using simulations and propose simple modifications that can offer up to three-fold increase in performance in access networks that are prone to losses. These modifications require only minor changes to TCP implementations at the local network servers alone (and not at subscribers' PCs). 1...|$|R
