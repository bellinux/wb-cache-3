50|$|Every ENOS is a {{self-contained}} rescue system that functions {{in a local}} area. Its range {{is determined by the}} height of the receiving antenna mounted on the dive boat, the prevailing surface conditions and the distance of the direct line-of-sight. Receiving ranges of up to three nautical miles are standard. A range of up to six nautical miles is possible in optimal conditions.The system uses radio frequencies that do not require licenses or fees; and are determined by the national laws of radio frequencies where the system is operating. It does not use the international distress frequency.ENOS is the only rescue system for water sports which relays the GPS position of the diver in distress directly to a local receiving unit. The alert is not relayed to coast guards or other marine rescue organisations.The receiver is alerted immediately which enables the nearby boat to quickly and independently initiate the diver rescue and bear the costs. A single ENOS-Receiver can receive alerts from all the ENOS-Transmitters operating on the same frequency within the same <b>receiving</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This circuit had two advantages. [...] One {{was that}} {{by using the}} correct turns ratio, the {{impedance}} of the antenna could be matched to the impedance of the receiver, to transfer maximum RF power to the receiver. Impedance matching was important to achieve maximum <b>receiving</b> <b>range</b> in the unamplified receivers of this era. [...] The coils usually had taps which could be selected by a multiposition switch. The second advantage was that due to [...] "loose coupling" [...] it had a much narrower bandwidth than a simple tuned circuit, and the bandwidth could be adjusted. [...] Unlike in an ordinary transformer, the two coils were [...] "loosely coupled"; separated physically so not all the magnetic field from the primary passed through the secondary, reducing the mutual inductance. This gave the coupled tuned circuits much [...] "sharper" [...] tuning, a narrower bandwidth than a single tuned circuit. In the [...] "Navy type" [...] loose coupler (see picture), widely used with crystal receivers, the smaller secondary coil was mounted on a rack which could be slid {{in or out of}} the primary coil, to vary the mutual inductance between the coils. [...] When the operator encountered an interfering signal at a nearby frequency, the secondary could be slid further out of the primary, reducing the coupling, which narrowed the bandwidth, rejecting the interfering signal. A disadvantage was that all three adjustments in the loose coupler - primary tuning, secondary tuning, and coupling - were interactive; changing one changed the others. So tuning in a new station was a process of successive adjustments.|$|E

5000|$|On 18 December 1936, {{just three}} days after a United Air Line {{twin-engine}} Boeing plane was lost with 12 persons on board near Saugus, CA another plane was reported missing. This was Northwest Airlines westbound Flight 1. The Lockheed 10A Electra (NC 14935) piloted by Joseph P Livermore and co-pilot Arthur Haid was in route from Chicago to Seattle with 10 intermediate stops. It had departed Missoula, MT at 12:33 a.m. bound for Spokane, WA. At 1:59 pilot Livermore {{reported that they were}} not <b>receiving</b> <b>range</b> signals and the plane was picking up ice. They requested the radio personnel stationed at Spokane to listen for the flight in the skies over the range station. Spokane could not hear the airplane and confirmed that the signal generator was working properly. Livermore next radioed that they were over a town with a large number of lights and asked Spokane to check his position as they could not stay up much longer due to the ice. At 3:19 a telephone operator confirmed that a plane was circling Elk River, Idaho and pilot Livermore was notified his location. Livermore then radioed they were now on course on the [...] "south leg" [...] of Spokane [...] "heading north". No further contact was made. On 26 December the wreckage of the plane was found about 400 feet from the top of a mountain known as Cemetery Ridge in the Saint Joe National Forest near Kellogg, Idaho. It was determined the aircraft had impacted while in level flight and was destroyed catching fire with the two pilots being killed instantly. The weather that evening had been reported as light rains at low level, light snow squalls and icing conditions and it was believed there was possible fog in the area. A subsequent investigation found no failures in the aircraft but noted the possibility of instrumentation problems. Livermore had gone North rather than the standard West route, possible to shorten the time in the storm, and may have become lost, being unfamiliar with the area, when they flew into the mountain top at 3:23 a.m. just four minutes after their last transmission.|$|E

30|$|The {{problem of}} hidden {{terminals}} {{is a critical}} issue affecting the performance and the reliability of ad hoc networks. Hidden terminals are two terminals that although they are outside the interference range of one another, they share a set of terminals that are within the transmission range of both. Broadcast in IEEE 802.11 does not use virtual carrier sensing and thus only relies on physical carrier sensing to reduce collision [16]. In the case of broadcast communication, the potential hidden terminal area needs to include the <b>receiving</b> <b>range</b> of all the terminals within transmission range of the sender. Thus, the potential hidden terminal area in broadcast can be dramatically larger than that of unicast. In other words, the broadcast fashion of V 2 V safety communications makes them more sensitive to hidden terminal problems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose an {{adaptive}} MAC Protocol for WSN with mobile nodes, namely RM-MAC (RSSI-Based Mobility Support MAC). The protocol at first uses RSSI to quantify the nodes ’ <b>receiving</b> <b>range</b> for the creating of a list of neighboring nodes. Then, it adopts Kalman filter model to predetermine the mobile nodes ’ position after {{a certain period of}} time. Finally, by referring to the RSSI values and the predetermine position vector, it builds an adaptive model to coordinate dynamically the synchronizing cycle within the virtual clusters so that the clusters can maintain a high connectivity with the mobile nodes. Simulation results shows that compared with S-MAC, RM-MAC can obtain a higher network connectivity and delivery ratio by dynamically coordinating the synchronizing frequency at the cost of some energy. Furthermore, we find that the delivery ratio has close relationship with the quantification level and the cluster switch thresholds...|$|E

This algorithm mainly includes SINS-assisted searching method of optimum slant-range of underwater acoustic propagation multipath, SINS/LBL tightly coupled model and multi-sensor information fusion algorithm. Fuzzy correlation peak problem of underwater LBL acoustic propagation multipath could be solved based on SINS positional information, thus improving LBL positional accuracy. Moreover, introduction of SINS-centered LBL locating information could compensate accumulative AUV position error effectively and regularly. Compared to loosely coupled algorithm, this tightly coupled algorithm can still provide accurate location information {{when there are}} fewer than four available hydrophones (or within the signal <b>receiving</b> <b>range).</b> Therefore, effective positional calibration area of tightly coupled system based on LBL array is wider and has higher reliability and fault tolerance than loosely coupled.

40|$|Abstract – IEEE 802. 11 defines {{physical}} and virtual carrier sensing mechanisms to avoid interference in wireless local area networks {{for the kind}} of interference originating from within the <b>receiving</b> <b>range</b> of a receiver. However, in wireless ad hoc networks most interference comes from outside of this range. So, the effectiveness of IEEE 802. 11 carrier sensing mechanism in ad hoc networks has attracted many studies. Prior research has attempted to evaluate effectiveness from a spatial viewpoint only, using an analytical model to estimate the size of the interference area of an ongoing communication based on the transmitter-receiver distance. Unlike this, the temporal effectiveness of the carrier sensing mechanism has been ignored. In this paper we propose an analysis combining spatial and temporal viewpoint to study the effect of interference on the performance of IEEE 802. 11 protocol in ad hoc networks. We also compare the effectiveness of {{physical and}} virtual carrier sensing mechanisms, known as RTS/CTS mechanism, in wireless ad hoc networks. I...|$|E

40|$|This work {{presents}} the optimization of antenna captured {{low power radio}} frequency (RF) to direct current (DC) power converters using Schottky diodes for powering remote wireless sensors. Linearized models using scattering parameters show that an antenna and a matched diode rectifier can be described as a form of coupled resonator with different individual resonator properties. The analytical models show that the maximum voltage gain of the coupled resonators is mainly related to the antenna, diode and load (remote sensor) resistances at matched conditions or resonance. The analytical models were verified with experimental results. Different passive wireless RF power harvesters offering high selectivity, broadband response and high voltage sensitivity are presented. Measured results show that with an optimal resistance of antenna and diode, it is possible to achieve high RF to DC voltage sensitivity of 0. 5 V and efficiency of 20 % at − 30 dBm antenna input power.

40|$|The Global Positioning System (GPS) is {{a revolutionary}} advance in navigation. Users can {{determine}} latitude, longitude, and altitude by <b>receiving</b> <b>range</b> information {{from at least}} four satellites. The statistical accuracy of the user's position is directly proportional to the statistical accuracy of the range measurement. Range errors are caused by clock errors, ephemeris errors, atmospheric delays, multipath errors, and receiver noise. Selective Availability, which the military uses to intentionally degrade accuracy for non-authorized users, is a major error source. The proportionality constant relating position errors to range errors is the Dilution of Precision (DOP) which {{is a function of}} the satellite geometry. Receivers separated by relatively short distances have the same satellite and atmospheric errors. Differential GPS (DGPS) removes these errors by transmitting pseudorange corrections from a fixed receiver to a mobile receiver. The corrected pseudorange at the moving receiver is now corrupted only by errors from the receiver clock, multipath, and measurement noise. This paper describes a software package that models position errors for various GPS and DGPS systems. The error model is used in the Real-Time Simulator and Cockpit Technology workstation simulations at NASA-LaRC. The GPS/DGPS sensor can simulate enroute navigation, instrument approaches, or on-airport navigation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{capacity}} of wireless ad hoc networks is mainly restricted {{by the number}} of concurrent transmissions. Recent studies found that multi-packet reception (MPR) can increase the number of concurrent transmissions and improve network capacity. This paper studies the {{capacity of}} 2 -D wireless networks wherein each node can decode at most k simultaneous transmis-sions within its <b>receiving</b> <b>range.</b> We call such networks k-MPR wireless networks. For comparison, we call traditional networks 1 -MPR wireless networks. Suppose that the number of nodes in a wireless network is n and each node can transmit at W bits/sec. For arbitrary k-MPR wireless networks, we show that when k = O(n), the capacity gain over 1 -MPR networks is Θ(k). When k = Ω(n), the capacity is Θ(Wn) bit-meters/sec and the network is scalable. For random k-MPR wireless networks, we show that when k = O(log n), the capacity upper bound and lower bound match and the capacity gain over 1 -MPR networks is Θ(k). When k = Ω(log n), even the lower bound has a capacity gain of Θ(log n) over 1 -MPR networks. From these results, we conclude that the main constraints for k-MPR wireless networks to utilize MPR ability are the limited number of transmitters and the limited number of flows served by each node.

40|$|Hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) {{is a novel}} tool in {{the field}} of active remote sensing, which has been widely used in many domains because of its {{advantageous}} ability of spectrum-gained. Especially in the precise monitoring of nitrogen in green plants, the HSL plays a dispensable role. The exiting HSL system used for nitrogen status monitoring has a multi-channel detector, which can improve the spectral resolution and <b>receiving</b> <b>range,</b> but maybe result in data redundancy, difficulty in system integration and high cost as well. Thus, it is necessary and urgent to pick out the nitrogen-sensitive feature wavelengths among the spectral range. The present study, aiming at solving this problem, assigns a feature weighting to each centre wavelength of HSL system by using matrix coefficient analysis and divergence threshold. The feature weighting is a criterion to amend the centre wavelength of the detector to accommodate different purpose, especially the estimation of leaf nitrogen content (LNC) in rice. By this way, the wavelengths high-correlated to the LNC can be ranked in a descending order, which are used to estimate rice LNC sequentially. In this paper, a HSL system which works based on a wide spectrum emission and a 32 -channel detector is conducted to collect the reflectance spectra of rice leaf. These spectra collected by HSL cover a range of 538 nm – 910 nm with a resolution of 12 nm. These 32 wavelengths are strong absorbed by chlorophyll in green plant among this range. The relationship between the rice LNC and reflectance-based spectra is modeled using partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machines (SVMs) based on calibration and validation datasets respectively. The results indicate that I) wavelength selection method of HSL based on feature weighting is effective to choose the nitrogen-sensitive wavelengths, which can also be co-adapted with the hardware of HSL system friendly. II) The chosen wavelength has a high correlation with rice LNC which can be retrieved by using PLS and SVMs regression methods...|$|E

30|$|Despite the {{orthogonality}} of LTE’s uplink transmission, it {{can happen}} that signals which are received at the base station with low power are drown out by strong signals from other users. Reason is the limited quantization resolution of the base station’s analog-to-digital converter. Since this effect causes a quality of service degradation for users at the cell edge, the dynamic <b>receive</b> power <b>range</b> of uplink signals arriving at the base station should be upper limited. However, setting an adequate upper limit for the dynamic <b>receive</b> power <b>range</b> is not trivial since many effects, such as quantization noise, fast fading etc., decrease the dynamic range which the analog-to-digital converter can handle in theory. In this paper, we measure the maximal uplink dynamic <b>receive</b> power <b>range,</b> denoted as uplink dynamic range threshold, for our LTE-like measurement setup by monitoring the uplink bit-error-rate of a first user while decreasing its transmit power during {{the presence of a}} second adjacently scheduled user with fixed transmit power.
