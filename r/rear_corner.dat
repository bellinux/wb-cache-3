25|$|Brachiosaurids shared synapomorphies, new traits {{typical for}} the group. They possessed middle and rear back {{vertebrae}} with long, 'rod-like' transverse processes. In the pelvis, the ischium had a shortened pubic peduncle, the contact surface with the pubic bone. Their humeri, upper arm bones, {{had a large}} deltopectoral crest. Their skull roofs showed wide supratemporal fenestrae, openings for the muscles. They had neural arches placed more on front of the vertebrae, shoulder blades that were expanded at the top end, irregularly shaped coracoids in the shoulder girdle, and triangular projections {{on the underside of}} the front branch of their quadratojugal bones at the lower <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> of the skull.|$|E

25|$|The Mark IV {{brought the}} most {{comprehensive}} changes to the Spitfire. It featured a completely re-designed cut-off rear end, giving a strong family resemblance to the Triumph Stag and Triumph 2000 models, {{both of which were}} also Michelotti-designed. The front end was also cleaned up, with a new bonnet pressing losing the weld lines on top of the wings from the older models, and the doors were given recessed handles and squared-off glass in the top <b>rear</b> <b>corner.</b> The interior was much improved: a proper full-width dashboard was provided, putting the instruments ahead of the driver rather than over the centre console. This was initially black plastic however was replaced with wood in 1973.|$|E
25|$|Externally the 1972 {{model was}} the same as the 1971 model, {{retaining}} the same front end but with 3 vertical strips added to the grille. The chrome trunk lid strip and <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> chrome of the 1970 Rebel and 1971 Marador was dropped. The rear bumper again was the 1970 Rebel bumper but with a new lens assembly with each assembly divided into nine recessed vertically rectangular lenses. Interior-wise the 1972 model saw the return of the round instrument dials of earlier Ambassador and 1967 Rebel models. The steering wheel {{was the same}} as previous models. New for the 1972 model was slimmer arm rests for the doors and a bench seat without the fold-down centre armrests.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{heavy rain}} early Friday morning, the track was dry {{for the first}} {{practice}} and remained that way all weekend. On his first lap, Barrichello became the first Formula 1 driver in three years of running at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to hit the concrete wall in the oval section of the track. As {{he was about to}} finish his first lap, his left rear tire lost pressure and the car was flung into the outer wall {{at the top of the}} main straight, ripping off the left <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> and front wing. Barrichello's car missed the energy-absorbing Steel And Foam Energy Reduction (SAFER) barrier that had been installed in front of the concrete wall in all of the oval turns the previous May. The Ferrari went across the grass at the bottom of Turn 13, up the banking, and hit the bare concrete wall at the beginning of the straight.|$|E

25|$|Features of the {{skeleton}} indicate that Lystrosaurus moved with a semi-sprawling gait. The lower <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> of the scapula (shoulder blade) was strongly ossified (built of strong bone), {{which suggests that}} movement of the scapula contributed to the stride length of the forelimbs and reduced the sideways flexing of the body. The five sacral vertebrae were massive but not fused {{to each other and}} to the pelvis, making the back more rigid and reducing sideways flexing while the animal was walking. Therapsids with fewer than five sacral vertebrae are thought to have had sprawling limbs, like those of modern lizards. In dinosaurs and mammals, which have erect limbs, the sacral vertebrae are fused {{to each other and to}} the pelvis. A buttress above each acetabulum (hip socket) is thought to have prevented dislocation of the femur (thigh bone) while Lystrosaurus was walking with a semi-sprawling gait. The forelimbs of Lystrosaurus were massive, and Lystrosaurus is thought to have been a powerful burrower.|$|E
500|$|Poe was {{originally}} buried without a headstone towards the <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> of the churchyard near his grandfather, David Poe, Sr. A headstone of white Italian marble, {{paid for by}} Poe's cousin Neilson Poe, was destroyed before it reached the grave when a train derailed and plowed through the monument yard where it was being kept. Instead, it was marked with a sand-stone block that read [...] "No. 80". In 1873, Southern poet Paul Hamilton Hayne visited Poe's grave and published a newspaper article describing its poor condition and suggesting a more appropriate monument. Sara Sigourney Rice, a teacher in Baltimore's public schools, took advantage of renewed interest in Poe's grave site and personally solicited for funds. She even had some of her elocution students give public performances to raise money. Many in Baltimore and throughout the United States contributed; the final $650 came from Philadelphia publisher and philanthropist George William Childs. The new monument was designed by architect George A. Frederick and built by Colonel Hugh Sisson, and included a medallion of Poe by artist Adalbert Volck. All three men were from Baltimore. The {{total cost of the}} monument, with the medallion, amounted to slightly more than $1,500. ($31,600 in 2014 dollars) ...|$|E
500|$|The sexes {{of the red}} wattlebird {{are similar}} in size and plumage, {{the length of the}} adult male ranging from [...] and adult female [...] With an average weight of , the red wattlebird {{is one of the largest}} nectar-feeding birds in the world, and second largest species of honeyeater native to Australia, eclipsed only by the yellow wattlebird. The crown, {{forehead}} and upper lores (area between the eyes and nostrils) are dark brown, streaked with pale brown at the front of the crown and white at the rear of the crown. The nape (back of the neck) is slightly paler brown, with white streaks. A whitish triangular marking covers the lower lores and anterior ear covert feathers, bordered below by a dark brown stripe from the lower mandible down to the wattle and around to behind the eye. The throat is dark brown streaked with white. The iris of the eye is orange-red to crimson. The distinctive pinkish-red wattles dangle from the lower <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> of the ear coverts on either side of the neck, and there is a sliver of pink bare skin at the lower border of the white patch on the face. The chest and belly are streaked white, and there is a bright yellow patch towards the tail. The strong legs and feet are pink or pinkish-brown and the downward-curving bill is black. The average length of the bill is around , and [...] wide and [...] high at its base. The gape is grey-black, while the inside of the mouth is orange. In common with other honeyeaters, the red wattlebird has a long specialized tongue to extract nectar from flowers. The tongue can extend well beyond the tip of the bill and is divided at the end to form a brush-like structure with over a hundred bristles that soak up nectar by capillary action.|$|E

5000|$|Workers of C. dieteri {{range in}} length between 3.22 - 3.48 mm, {{and a head}} length of 0.80 - 0.88 mm. The frontal ridges on the face, <b>rear</b> <b>corners</b> of the head along with {{the borders of the}} pronotal and gastral wings are a lighter {{coloration}} {{than the rest of the}} workers bodies. The exoskeleton is covered with varying sized reticulation, and hairs of several types are present. There are two long thin hairs present on the second tergite of the gaster, while the rear borders of the hind gasteral tergites have rare club-tipped hairs. The head is shorter than wide, with truncated <b>rear</b> <b>corners</b> and a concave rear edge. The face has two raised ridges that have crenulated margins, and the <b>rear</b> <b>corners</b> are also crenulated. The pronotum with a narrow, long, continuous suture, while the mesonotum and the petiole are both unarmed, lacking the larger spines seen on other species. [...] The denser reticulation of the exoskeleton, along with the slightly smaller head size separates C. dieteri from its sister species Cephalotes integerrimus, also from Dominican amber.|$|R

2500|$|During {{interviews}} conducted later {{it became apparent}} that all of the [...] girls recognized the danger they were in. Some conversed among themselves throughout the ordeal. Shortly before Roberts opened fire, two sisters, Marian and Barbara Fisher, 13 and 11, requested that they be shot first that the others might be spared. Barbara was wounded, while Marian was killed. A child's loud screaming was heard from within the school. A team of officers was positioned just behind a shed attached to the <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> of the schoolhouse and they requested permission over the radio to approach the windows. The permission was denied.|$|E
2500|$|Early 1917 it was {{suggested}} to construct some vehicles as flamethrower tanks by installing a flamethrowing device in two armoured turrets, one at the left front corner and the other at the right <b>rear</b> <b>corner,</b> each having a field of fire of about 180°. [...] The fuel reservoirs would be inside the hull. No production resulted. In February 1917, Schneider proposed to build a variant with a thirty-two centimetres wider hull fitted in the front with a 47mm gun and two machine-gun turrets placed diagonally behind the driver position, while the engine was relocated {{to the rear of}} the vehicle. On 2 April 1917 the Ministry of Armament asked Schneider to design two improved versions of the Schneider CA: one with a gun turret, the calibre not surpassing 47mm if it were a long gun; the other with a long 75mm gun in the front of the hull.|$|E
2500|$|To {{the modern}} eye, the tank is hardly {{recognizable}} as such and appears as an armoured steel box resting {{on top of}} a caterpillar tractor. [...] It has no turret, and its inconspicuous main armament is a fortification 75mm Blockhaus Schneider, placed in a barbette in the right front corner of the tank. [...] The right side had been chosen because the gunner had to stand {{to the left of the}} barrel to operate the gun. [...] The cannon type was developed from a 75mm trench mortar that had been adapted to fire from a fixed fortification position by adding a recoil compensator and a gun shield; in this configuration it weighed 210 kilogrammes. [...] This short-barrelled cannon had a length of just 9.5 calibres. It fired the standard French HE Model 1915 75mm shell but with a reduced propelling charge, shortening the length of the round from 350 to 241 millimetres, allowing for a muzzle velocity of only two hundred metres per second. This limited the maximum range to 2200 metres, the practical range was six hundred metres and the tank needed to close within two hundred metres of a point target to allow for precision shooting. [...] The gun has a traverse of 60°, a depression of -10° and an elevation of 30°. [...] The ammunition stock is ninety vertically stowed rounds. [...] Two 8mm Hotchkiss Model 1914 machine guns, projecting from the flanks in large hemispherical ballmounts, and resting on pintles, complement the short 75mm gun. The right machine gun is, because of the room needed for the main gun, positioned more to the rear than the left one. [...] The machine guns have a traverse of 106°, a depression of -45° and an elevation of 20°. [...] To the right of the cannon there is a bin for twenty readily accessible 75mm rounds. [...] Three other bins are positioned respectively at the extreme right <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> (fourteen rounds), to the left of the engine (thirty-two) and at the left <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> (twenty-four). The latter is situated to the right of a bin, at the extreme left corner, for the stock of four thousand rounds of 8mm ammunition. In 1918, in practice fifty belts with ninety-six rounds were carried, for a total of 4800 rounds.|$|E

2500|$|The 1969 VAM Javelin {{obtained}} the previously optional heater as standard equipment, the foot pedals received bright trim and the accelerator was {{changed into a}} firewall-mounted unit, a support pull strap was applied on the passenger's side dashboard above the glove box, the center cover with the radio speaker grid changed into a woodgrain unit. A unique aspect of the 1969 Javelin is that it kept the same gauge configuration as the 1968 models in contrast to AMC's modifications to the Javelin (and AMX) instrument panel for 1969 with a larger 8,000 RPM tach on the right pod, leaving the smaller left pod exclusive for the clock. The VAM Javelins exterior now had bright trim package with new moldings starting {{at the corners of}} the tail lights running on the sides all the way to lower <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> of the side glass and drip rails plus all around the rear glass and top edge of the C-pillars. The new Javelins looked more luxurious, even though a factory vinyl roof was not available. The front fender emblems were relocated to the base of each C-pillar and were accompanied by red-white-blue bulls eye emblems. A third Javelin emblem was applied near the lower right corner of the grille. The 1969 model year was also VAM's first self-engineered engine, the , 9.5:1 compression ratio [...] six-cylinder engine with a two-barrel Carter WCD carburetor and a new VAM-engineered 266 degree camshaft.

60|$|Half an {{hour later}} orders were issued that the men were to prepare for action, and it became known among the {{officers}} that the general had determined to leave a small garrison to protect the baggage and camels in the zareba, and to push forward {{with the rest of}} the force and capture the wells, and then send back and fetch in the camels and baggage. But the movement was delayed until ten o'clock in hopes that the enemy would attack. As they did not do so, orders were given, and the square formed up. The Guards' Camel Corps formed half the front of the square, and the right flank. The Mounted Infantry filled up the other half of the front, and half the left flank. The rest of the left flank and the rear were formed by the Heavy Camel Corps and the Naval Brigade; the hundred men of the Sussex taking the right <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> between them and the Guards, while the Naval Brigade with their Gardner gun were in the centre of the rear line, between the troop of the 4th and 5th Dragoon Guards and that of the 1st and 2d Life Guards and Blues.|$|E
60|$|Maelzel now {{informs the}} company that he will {{disclose}} to their view the mechanism of the machine. Taking from his pocket a bunch of keys he unlocks with one of them, door marked ~ in the cut above, and throws the cupboard fully open to the inspection of all present. Its whole interior is apparently filled with wheels, pinions, levers, and other machinery, crowded very closely together, so that the eye can penetrate but a little distance into the mass. Leaving this door open to its full extent, he goes now round {{to the back of}} the box, and raising the drapery of the figure, opens another door situated precisely in the rear of the one first opened. Holding a lighted candle at this door, and shifting the position of the whole machine repeatedly at the same time, a bright light is thrown entirely through the cupboard, which is now clearly seen to be full, completely full, of machinery. The spectators being satisfied of this fact, Maelzel closes the back door, locks it, takes the key from the lock, lets fall the drapery of the figure, and comes round to the front. The door marked I, it will be remembered, is still open. The exhibiter now proceeds to open the drawer which lies beneath the cupboards at the bottom of the box--for although there are apparently two drawers, there is really only one--the two handles and two key holes being intended merely for ornament. Having opened this drawer to its full extent, a small cushion, and a set of chessmen, fixed in a frame work made to support them perpendicularly, are discovered. Leaving this drawer, as well as cupboard No. 1 open, Maelzel now unlocks door No. 2, and door No. 3, which are discovered to be folding doors, opening into one and the same compartment. To the right of this compartment, however, (that is to say the spectators' right) a small division, six inches wide, and filled with machinery, is partitioned off. The main compartment itself (in speaking of that portion of the box visible upon opening doors 2 and 3, we shall always call it the main compartment) is lined with dark cloth and contains no machinery whatever beyond two pieces of steel, quadrant-shaped, and situated one in each of the rear top corners of the compartment. A small protuberance about eight inches square, and also covered with dark cloth, lies on the floor of the compartment near the <b>rear</b> <b>corner</b> on the spectators' left hand. Leaving doors No. 2 and No. 3 open as well as the drawer, and door No. I, the exhibiter now goes round {{to the back of the}} main compartment, and, unlocking another door there, displays clearly all the interior of the main compartment, by introducing a candle behind it and within it. The whole box being thus apparently disclosed to the scrutiny of the company, Maelzel, still leaving the doors and drawer open, rolls the Automaton entirely round, and exposes the back of the Turk by lifting up the drapery. A door about ten inches square is thrown open in the loins of the figure, and a smaller one also in the left thigh. The interior of the figure, as seen through these apertures, appears to be crowded with machinery. In general, every spectator is now thoroughly satisfied of having beheld and completely scrutinized, at one and the same time, every individual portion of the Automaton, and the idea of any person being concealed in the interior, during so complete an exhibition of that interior, if ever entertained, is immediately dismissed as preposterous in the extreme.|$|E
