40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the changes in the {{perception}} of the university environment that occurred in four selected. groups of freshmen residence hall students: females residents in single-sex halls (N = 150), female residents in coeducational halls (N = 89), male residents in single-sex halls (N = 95), and male residents in coeducational halls (N = 96). The College and University Environment Scales was the instrument utilized to measure the students' perceptions of the university environment. Additional data were gathered from files in the Residence Hall Programs Office and from a brief questionnaire compiled by the investigator. During the week prior to the Fall term 1970 at Oregon State University the participants were administered the CUES and the supplemental questionnaire. The CUES was readministered six months later following two terms of in-residence living by the participants. The data was subjected to statistical analysis with the. 05 level of significance being accepted as indicating degrees of confidence that differences were real. Hypotheses were stated in the null form indicating that, by comparison, no significant differences would appear. The following groups were statistically treated relative to the perceptual change in the university environment that occurred: 1. Freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls. 2. Freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls. 3. Freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls. 4. Freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls. The following group comparisons were statistically treated relative to differences in degree of change in perception of the university environment that occurred: 1. Freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls and freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls. 2. Freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls and freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls. 3. Freshmen <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls and freshmen <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls. 4. Freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls and freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls. 5. Interaction of coeducational and single-sex residence halls and freshmen male and female residents. From the findings of this study the following conclusions were drawn. 1. Freshmen students <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls change their perceptions of the university environment significantly on most scales and in a negative direction during their first six months of attendance at college. 2. Freshmen female residents in single-sex residence halls experience a significantly greater degree of change in their perception of the university environment on the Awareness scale than do freshmen female residents in coeducational residence halls. 3. Freshmen male residents in single-sex residence halls do not differ significantly in the degree of change in their perceptions of the university environment than do freshmen male residents in coeducational residence halls. 4. Freshmen residents in single-sex residence halls change their perception of the university environment to a significantly greater degree on the Awareness scale than do freshmen residents in coeducational residence halls. 5. Freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls change their perception of the university environment to a significantly greater degree on the Community scale than do freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls. 6. Freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls change their perception of the university environment to a significantly greater degree on the Practicality scale than do freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> residence halls. 7. A significant relationship exists between sex and type of residence hall on the Scholarship scale. Freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls and freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls change their perceptions significantly greater on the Scholarship scale than do freshmen males <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> coeducational residence halls and freshmen females <b>residing</b> <b>in</b> single-sex residence halls...|$|R
