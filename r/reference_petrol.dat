40|$|We {{examine the}} {{competitiveness}} of series hybrid compared to fuel cell, parallel hybrid, and regular cars. We use public domain data to determine efficiency, fuel consumption, total costs of ownership and greenhouse gas emissions resulting from drivetrain choices. The series hybrid drivetrain can be seen both {{as an alternative to}} petrol, diesel and parallel hybrid cars, as well as an intermediate stage towards fully electric or fuel cell cars. We calculate the fuel consumption and costs of four diesel-fuelled series hybrid, four plug-in hybrid and four fuel cell car configurations, and compared these to three reference cars. We find that series hybrid cars may reduce fuel consumption by 34 – 47 %, but cost € 5000 – 12, 000 more. Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced to 89 – 103 g CO 2 km− 1 compared to <b>reference</b> <b>petrol</b> (163 g km− 1) and diesel cars (156 g km− 1). Series hybrid cars with wheel motors have lower weight and 7 – 21 % lower fuel consumption than those with central electric motors. The fuel cell car remains uncompetitive even if production costs of fuel cells come down by 90 %. Plug-in hybrid cars are competitive when driving large distances on electricity, and/or if cost of batteries come down substantially. Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions may be reduced to 60 – 69 g CO 2 km− 1...|$|E

The scientific and production program of metrological assurance of test methods and control means for petrol and petroleum product composition and properties on the basis of reference materials with trademark NPO "INTEGRSO" is self-fulfilled. From 1986 more than 185 types of reference materials were developed and produced including 36 types of import-substituting reference materials...|$|R
40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} {{potential}} economic feasibility of three smallholder energy crop production systems (jatropha, cassava and eucalyptus) under typical semi-arid conditions in Eastern Africa. This feasibility {{is determined by}} assessing net present values (NPV), internal rates of return (IRR), benefit-cost ratios (BCR) and payback periods (PBP). In addition, the production costs are compared to the costs of <b>reference</b> energy systems, <b>petrol,</b> diesel and pellets. Low and intermediate input systems are considered and {{specific attention is paid}} to the opportunity cost of labour, by considering both family labour (no labour costs) and hired labour. The results show that all family labour settings have positive NPVs and high IRR and BCR values. Moreover, cassava has the highest family labour NPV (2900 – 5800 US ha 1) and the shortest PBP, but the required investment costs are high in comparision with the other crops. If hired labour is used, the NPV of eucalyptus is highest (380 – 1400 / ha 1), and it is also the least sensitive to changes in wages and yields. Jatropha performs best only for the indicator IRR and only with family labour or low labour opportunity costs. The analysis and comparison of bioenergy production costs shows that eucalyptus pellets (2. 6 – 3. 1 GJ 1) are competitive compared with reference pellets at current market prices (5 GJ 1). Jatropha SVO (19 GJ 1) and cassava ethanol (19 – 36 GJ 1) are only competitive with fossil diesel (21 GJ 1) and petrol (25 GJ 1) in a family labour setting. At current values jatropha biodiesel (24 – 37 GJ 1) is not competitive. The economic performance is sensitive to variations in crop yields and yield data are highly uncertain. However, this study demonstrates that there is considerable potential for increasing the economic performance by further improvements in yield, harvesting efficiency and conversion efficiency as well as reductions in transport and packaging costs...|$|R
