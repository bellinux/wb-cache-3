5|$|GameSpot {{gave the}} game an 8 out of 10, praising the game's characters, art, voice acting and {{challenging}} gameplay. However, {{they noted that}} at times that spoken dialogue sometimes did not match the displayed text dialogue. A <b>reviewer</b> of PC Gamer scored the game 69 out of 100, noting that Space Run attempts to reverse the typical tower defense concept, but ultimately relies on memorizing missions rather than clever design. The <b>reviewer</b> considered {{the best part of}} the game to be the time bonus, which is necessary to earn full reputation.|$|E
5|$|In March 2013, Network World tested eight {{social media}} {{management}} tools. The <b>reviewer</b> found that Viralheat {{was the lowest}} cost, and supported more social media sites than competitors, but lacked the features to support multi-user accounts needed for large (enterprise) customers. The <b>reviewer</b> also praised Viralheat for its user interface and easy cross-posting across different social networks, but said its reporting and analytics were limited. For example, only three date-ranges could be selected when generating a report.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have high}} {{marks on the}} game's cast of characters, but were divided in their {{opinions}} of the choice of voice actors. GameTrailers's <b>reviewer</b> disliked that several famous X-Men and Brotherhood characters were not playable, but appeared only as side characters. They also cited issues with voice acting and a convoluted story. Unlike the critic from GameTrailers, G4's <b>reviewer</b> praised the overall story, and further praised the selection of characters for the cast. Greg Mueller of GameSpot also praised the game's vast cast of characters.|$|E

40|$|Finnish-born writer Susanna Alakoski’s novel Svinalängorna {{became a}} big success after being {{published}} in Sweden in April 2006. Though the novel has many themes in common with earlier literature written by and about Finnish immigrants in Sweden, {{little attention has been}} brought to this fact by <b>reviewers</b> and journalists. This essay examines connections between Alakoski’s novel and Finnish migrant literature in Sweden, mainly from the 1970 s, and how these connections have been recognised by <b>reviewers</b> in Sweden and Finland. Based on the examination made here, Svinalängorna can be said to have several significant themes and features in common with other Finnish immigrant literature written in Sweden. However, in the examined material, none of the Swedish <b>reviewers</b> and only two of the Finnish <b>reviewers</b> referred to earlier literature written by and/or about Finns in Sweden. The main reference point for the Swedish <b>reviewers</b> was traditional Swedish working-class literature while the Finnish <b>reviewers</b> mainly referred to newer Finnish literature exploring similar themes: alcoholism, poverty and childhood. In general, the Finnish <b>reviewers</b> found the novel more familiar than the Swedish <b>reviewers...</b>|$|R

A Life review praised Sullivan's adaptation, particularly his addition of a love interest for Jekyll, and complimented the performances of Mansfield, Cameron and Harkins.|$|E
5|$|The George C. Marshall Institute and Fred Singer, {{two of the}} subjects, {{have been}} {{critical}} of the book. Other reviewers have been more favorable.

50|$|In America, Fossil Fighters scores {{averaged}} between 7 and 8. <b>Reviewers</b> generally {{praised the}} game for being fun, having simple yet surprisingly addictive cleaning while having battles that were somewhat enjoyable.

5|$|Dearly Stars sold 30,786 {{copies in}} its first week of release in Japan, and ranked as the tenth best-selling video game in Japan that week. The game {{received}} a score of 30 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu. Critics have described Dearly Stars as suitable for beginners to the Idolmaster series for drawing out the series' essence and reorganizing it into a simpler and easier-to-understand form. At the same time, Famitsu <b>reviewer</b> Sekai Sandai Miyokawa thinks that fans of the series will feel from Dearly Stars {{the growth of the}} 765 Pro idols and the overall growth of the series. Reviewers note that despite the change in the game's details compared to previous games in the series, such as the change in perspective from the producer to the idol, Dearly Stars still plays like an Idolmaster game. However, another Famitsu <b>reviewer</b> stated that because other aspects of the gameplay in Dearly Stars are similar to previous Idolmaster games such as doing lessons and auditions, the sense of enjoyment is not that different from other games. A <b>reviewer</b> for Famitsu felt it was easier to empathize with an idol when the story was told from their perspective.|$|E

40|$|Despite their {{critical}} {{importance to the}} scientific enterprise, <b>reviewers</b> receive no formal training and reviewing has become a skill that they pick up through trial and error. Additionally, because most <b>reviewers</b> do not receive any feedback on their performance, any bad reviewing habits become entrenched over time. This has contributed to significant and unnecessary anxiety about reviewing and to antagonistic encounters between <b>reviewers</b> and authors. This paper seeks to correct this situation by defining <b>reviewers</b> as co-creators of scholarship and the reviewing as a quality control process {{in the production of}} scientific scholarship. The paper provides three groups of activities aimed at creating the right mindset among <b>reviewers</b> to facilitate this co-creation and quality control perspective: relationships, commitment and honest decisions and recommendations. <b>reviewers,</b> reviewing, scientific enterprise, scholarship, co-creations, Teaching/Communication/Extension/Profession,...|$|R

5|$|Some reviewers fondly {{recalled}} serendipitous in-game encounters as {{they learned}} the game environment's unwritten rules. Not knowing how foreign figures would react, Rock, Paper, Shotgun <b>reviewer</b> treated new encounters as puzzles. This experimentation led to moments of fearful scrambling across {{a room to}} avoid a new, encroaching enemy type, and discovering that other enemies that are harmless if left alone. Rain World was abundant with opportunities for a player to demonstrate ingenuity and improvisation, according to GameSpot <b>reviewer,</b> whose highlights included making a mouse into a dark room's lantern, using weapons as climbable objects, and luring enemies into battle to distract from the Slugcat's presence. Those critics considered these mysterious, perceptive interactions {{to be among the}} game's best features, though far outweighed by Rain World punishing game mechanics.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Inter-rater {{reliability}} (IRR) {{is mainly}} assessed based on only two <b>reviewers</b> of unknown expertise. The {{aim of this}} paper is to examine differences in the IRR of the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and R(evised) -AMSTAR depending on the pair of <b>reviewers.</b> Methods Five <b>reviewers</b> independently applied AMSTAR and R-AMSTAR to 16 systematic reviews (eight Cochrane reviews and eight non-Cochrane reviews) from the field of occupational health. Responses were dichotomized and reliability measures were calculated by applying Holsti’s method (r) and Cohen’s kappa (κ) to all potential pairs of <b>reviewers.</b> Given that five <b>reviewers</b> participated in the study, there were ten possible pairs of <b>reviewers.</b> Results Inter-rater reliability varied for AMSTAR between r =  0. 82 and r =  0. 98 (median r =  0. 88) using Holsti’s method and κ =  0. 41 and κ =  0. 69 (median κ =  0. 52) using Cohen’s kappa and for R-AMSTAR between r =  0. 77 and r =  0. 89 (median r =  0. 82) and κ =  0. 32 and κ =  0. 67 (median κ =  0. 45) depending on the pair of <b>reviewers.</b> The same pair of <b>reviewers</b> yielded the highest IRR for both instruments. Pairwise Cohen’s kappa reliability measures showed a moderate correlation between AMSTAR and R-AMSTAR (Spearman’s ρ = 0. 50). The mean inter-rater reliability for AMSTAR was highest for item 1 (κ =  1. 00) and item 5 (κ =  0. 78), while lowest values were found for items 3, 8, 9 and 11, which showed only fair agreement. Conclusions Inter-rater reliability varies widely depending on the pair of <b>reviewers.</b> There may be some shortcomings associated with conducting reliability studies with only two <b>reviewers.</b> Further studies should include additional <b>reviewers</b> and should probably also take account of their level of expertise...|$|R
