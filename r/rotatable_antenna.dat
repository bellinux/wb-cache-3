50|$|The {{transmitter}} operated at 90 MHz (3.3 m) {{and had a}} {{power of}} about 500 W. The pulse was 20-μs in width and the PRF was 50 Hz, synchronized with the power-line. The receiver was super-regenerative, using type 955 and 956 Acorn tubes in the front end and a 9-MHz IF amplifier. Separate, <b>rotatable</b> <b>antennas</b> with stacked pairs of full-wave dipoles were used for transmitting and receiving. The beams were about 30 degrees wide, but the azimuth of the reflected signal was determined more precisely by using a goniometer. Pulses were displayed on the CRT of a commercial oscilloscope.|$|R

5000|$|There {{are some}} factors that {{separate}} true ALLISS technology from 'run-of-the-mill' rotatable HRS Type antennas. Thales pseudo-ALLISS <b>rotatable</b> <b>antenna</b> designs were procured from other antenna manufacturers that Thales acquired by corporate transactions. Technically only solid radiators distinguish true ALLISS systems {{from all other}} rotatable HRS type antennas.Only about 12% (estimate) of all HRS antennas in use globally are rotatable, and of these only 28 of the ALLISS systems have solid radiators.One must assume that only about 10% of HRS type antennas are rotatable, but compiled statistics are fragmentary. Only about 20% of rotatable HRS antennas are ALLISS, but {{this may be a}} slight overestimate.The Transmitter Documentation Project has most but not all stats on shortwave relay station antennas in use or historical.The Chinese SARFT is said to contain replicated ALLISS module technology, so to consider ALLISS technology as being exclusively in the domain of Thales is no longer true.|$|E

50|$|Construction {{work on this}} {{facility}} with an area of 950 hectares, which hoisted {{at the beginning of}} the 1990s over 20 transmitters working in the short- and mediumwave range, took place between 1968 and 1975. The antennas consist of several antennas for shortwave with heights between 60 and 160 metres and a large <b>rotatable</b> shortwave <b>antenna,</b> which can focus its radiation to every point on Earth. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, its transmitters were used by several foreign broadcasting companies. In 1997 several antennas were destroyed or damaged by excessive icing. The largest loss was a 350 metres tall guyed mast and a 250 metres tall mast used for mediumwave broadcasting.|$|R
50|$|In 1915, Robert Watson Watt {{joined the}} Meteorological Office as a meteorologist, working at an {{outstation}} at Aldershot in Hampshire. Over the next 20 years, he studied atmospheric phenomena and developed {{the use of}} radio signals generated by lightning strikes to map out the position of thunderstorms. The difficulty in pinpointing the direction of these fleeting signals using <b>rotatable</b> directional <b>antennas</b> led, in 1923, {{to the use of}} oscilloscopes in order to display the signals. The operation eventually moved to the outskirts of Slough in Berkshire, and in 1927 formed the Radio Research Station (RRS), Slough, an entity under the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR). Watson Watt was appointed the RRS Superintendent.|$|R
50|$|Radio Direction Finding {{works by}} {{comparing}} the signal strength of a directional antenna pointing in different directions. At first, this system was used by land and marine-based radio operators, using a simple <b>rotatable</b> loop <b>antenna</b> linked to a degree indicator. This system was later adopted for both ships and aircraft, and was widely used in the 1930s and 1940s. On pre-World War II aircraft, RDF antennas are easy to identify as the circular loops mounted above or below the fuselage. Later loop antenna designs were enclosed in an aerodynamic, teardrop-shaped fairing. In ships and small boats, RDF receivers first employed large metal loop antennas, similar to aircraft, but usually mounted atop a portable battery-powered receiver.|$|R

One of their broadcasting frequencies is the 7335 kHz slot that CHU (Canada) recently abandoned.|$|R
40|$|Polarimetric {{synthetic}} aperture radar (SAR) systems require verification and calibration of their polarimetric performance after launch. Dual-antenna calibration transponders with freely <b>rotatable,</b> linearly-polarized <b>antennas</b> {{are one of the}} most common calibration targets for this task. Because the transponders are used as a measurement standard, any misorientation of the polarization direction of the transponder antennas leads to characterization errors for the SAR instrument. In this paper, we present a novel calibration approach with which the polarization direction of linearly polarized antennas can be accurately determined; no additional reference antenna with a previously known polarization is required. The novel approach will reduce polarimetric transponder calibration errors in the future and will lead to a higher accuracy in calibrated, fully polarimetric SAR systems...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of the proposed National Spherical Tokamak Experiment (NSTX) is the investigation of very high {beta} regimes. Consequently, finding efficient methods of non-inductive heating and current drive required to heat and sustain such plasmas is of considerable importance. High-frequency fast waves are a promising candidate in this regard. However, in NSTX, the field-line pitch at the outer midplane will range from 0 up to 60 degrees from plasma start-up to current flattop. Thus, antenna strap orientation {{with respect to the}} edge magnetic field may have a serious impact on power coupling and absorption. To address this issue, the vacuum vessel of the Current Drive Experiment [...] Upgrade (CDX-U) spherical tokamak has been upgraded to accommodate a <b>rotatable</b> two-strap <b>antenna</b> capable of handling several hundred kilowatts in short pulses. Details of the antenna design and results from loading measurements made as a function of power, strap angle, and strap phasing will be presented. Results from microwave scattering experiments will also be discussed...|$|R
50|$|Later, RDF {{sets were}} {{equipped}} with <b>rotatable</b> ferrite loopstick <b>antennas,</b> {{which made the}} sets more portable and less bulky. Some were later partially automated {{by means of a}} motorized antenna (ADF). A key breakthrough was the introduction of a secondary vertical whip or 'sense' antenna that substantiated the correct bearing and allowed the navigator to avoid plotting a bearing 180 degrees opposite the actual heading. The U.S. Navy RDF model SE 995 which used a sense antenna was in use during World War I. After World War II, there were many small and large firms making direction finding equipment for mariners, including Apelco, Aqua Guide, Bendix, Gladding (and its marine division, Pearce-Simpson), Ray Jefferson, Raytheon, and Sperry. By the 1960s, many of these radios were actually made by Japanese electronics manufacturers, such as Panasonic, Fuji Onkyo, and Koden Electronics Co., Ltd. In aircraft equipment, Bendix and Sperry-Rand were two of the larger manufacturers of RDF radios and navigation instruments.|$|R
40|$|The Current Drive Experiment-Upgrade (CDX-U) is {{the first}} spherical torus (ST) to {{investigate}} radio frequency (RF) heating and current drive. To address the concern that large magnetic field line pitch at the outboard midplane of ST’s could inhibit successful coupling to the high harmonic fast wave (HHFW), a <b>rotatable,</b> two strap <b>antenna</b> was installed on CDX-U. Parasitic loading and impurity generation were discovered to be weak and nearly independent of antenna phasing and angle over a wide range, and fast wave electron heating has been observed. Plasma densities up to about 1012 cm- 3 were obtained with noninductive startup solely with HHFW. New ST diagnostics under development on CDX-U include a multilayer mirror (MLM) detector to measure ultrasoft X-rays, a twelve spatial point Thomson scattering (TS) system, and an Electron Bernstein Wave (EBW) system for both electron heating and electron temperature measurements. Preliminary experiments with a boron low velocity edge micropellet injector have also been performed, and further studies of its effectiveness for impurity control will be conducted {{with a variety of}} spectroscopic and imaging diagnostics on CDX-U.
