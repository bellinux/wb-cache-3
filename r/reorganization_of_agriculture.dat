60|$|The {{process of}} {{attraction}} {{will not end}} even there; {{the development of more}} and more scientific engineering and of really adaptable operatives will render possible agricultural contrivances that are now only dreams, and the diffusion of this new class over the country side--assuming the reasoning in my second chapter to be sound--will bring the lever of the improved schools under the agriculturist. The practically autonomous farm of the old epoch will probably be replaced by a great variety of types of cultivation, each with its labour-saving equipment. In this, as in most things, the future spells variation. The practical abolition of impossible distances over the world will tend to make every district specialize in the production for which it is best fitted, and to develop that production with an elaborate precision and economy. The chief opposing force to this tendency will be found in those countries where the tenure of the land is in small holdings. A population of small agriculturists that has really got itself well established is probably as hopelessly immovable a thing as the forces of progressive change will have to encounter. The Arcadian healthiness and simplicity of the small holder, and the usefulness of little hands about him, naturally results in his keeping the population on his plot up to the limit of bare subsistence. He avoids over-education, and his beasts live with him and his children in a natural kindly manner. He will have no idlers, and even grand-mamma goes weeding. His nett produce is less than the production of the larger methods, but his gross is greater, and usually it is mortgaged more or less. Along the selvage of many of the new roads we have foretold, his hens will peck and his children beg, far into the coming decades. This simple, virtuous, open-air life is to be found ripening in the north of France and Belgium, it culminated in Ireland in the famine years, it has held its own in China--with a use of female infanticide--for immemorable ages, and a number of excellent persons are endeavouring to establish it in England at the present time. At the Cape of Good Hope, under British rule, Kaffirs are being settled upon little inalienable holdings that must inevitably develop in the same direction, and over the Southern States the nigger squats and multiplies. It is fairly certain that these stagnant ponds of population, which will grow until public intelligence rises to the pitch of draining them, will on a greater scale parallel in the twentieth century the soon-to-be-dispersed urban slums of the nineteenth. But I do not see how they can obstruct, more than locally, the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> and horticulture upon the ampler and more economical lines mechanism permits, or prevent the development of a type of agriculturist as adaptable, alert, intelligent, unprejudiced, and modest as the coming engineer.|$|E

50|$|Russian forces began occupying Turkmen {{territory}} {{late in the}} 19th century. From their Caspian Sea base at Krasnovodsk (now Turkmenbashi), the Russians eventually {{overcame the}} Uzbek khanates. In 1881, the last significant resistance in Turkmen territory was crushed at the Battle of Geok Tepe, and shortly thereafter Turkmenistan was annexed, together with adjoining Uzbek territory, into the Russian Empire. In 1916 the Russian Empire's participation in World War I resonated in Turkmenistan, as an anticonscription revolt swept most of Russian Central Asia. Although the Russian Revolution of 1917 had little direct impact, in the 1920s Turkmen forces joined Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and Uzbeks in the so-called Basmachi Rebellion against {{the rule of the}} newly formed Soviet Union. In 1924 the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic was formed from the tsarist province of Transcaspia.

5000|$|Before {{the end of}} the First Five-Year Plan, {{the growing}} {{imbalance}} between industrial and agricultural growth, dissatisfaction with inefficiency, and lack of flexibility in the decision-making process convinced the nation's leaders - particularly Mao Zedong - that the highly centralized, industry-based Soviet model was not appropriate for China. In 1957 the government adopted measures to shift {{a great deal of the}} authority for economic decision making to the provincial-level, county, and local administrations. In 1958 the Second Five-Year Plan (1958-62), which was intended to continue the policies of the first plan, was abandoned. In its place the leadership adopted an approach that relied on spontaneous heroic efforts by the entire population to produce a dramatic [...] "great leap" [...] in production for all sectors of the economy at once. Further <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> was regarded as the key to the endeavor to leap suddenly to a higher stage of productivity. A fundamental problem was the lack of sufficient capital to invest heavily in both industry and agriculture at the same time. To overcome this problem, the leadership decided to attempt to create capital in the agricultural sector by building vast irrigation and water control works employing huge teams of farmers whose labor was not being fully utilized. Surplus rural labor also was to be employed to support the industrial sector by setting up thousands of small-scale, low-technology, [...] "backyard" [...] industrial projects in farm units, which would produce machinery required for agricultural development and components for urban industries. Mobilization of surplus rural labor and further improvements in agricultural efficiency were to be accomplished by a [...] "leap" [...] to the final stage of agricultural collectivization—the formation of people's communes.|$|E

40|$|The <b>Reorganization</b> <b>of</b> {{regional}} <b>agriculture</b> is analyzed {{from the}} viewpoints of transaction in this paper.

Regional agricultural organization is explained as an inter-organization. But the marketability problem is not solved by the customer relationship. To solve the marketability, regional agriculture is inter-organaized based on "regional incentive system". Transaction activities in regional agricultural organizations are explained by "agent-principal relationship". Opportunism is the most distressed problem in the agent-principal relationship. But this problem is also solved by the customer relationship and the regional incentive system...|$|R

40|$|Edited by Harry K. Schwarzweller and Brendan Mullan. Greenwich, CN: JAI Press. The twin {{processes}} of population concentration and deconcentration, {{working at the}} regional, metropolitan-nonmetropolitan and local levels, have defined the redistribution of the American people in the 20 th century. Over most of this period, there was a massive concentration of population into cities, with a multiplication of places as urbanization spread and larger centers captured ever greater numbers. Although growth generally was at the periphery of such places, with {{the widespread use of}} the automobile there was in addition a spread of population into formerly rural nearby areas. The recognition of this led to the adoption of the metropolitan area concept in 1950, and on this basis one may generalize that at least until 1970 the 20 th century settlement process could be described as concentration into metropolitan areas and deconcentration within these areas. In nonmetropolitan areas, larger places tended to grow most rapidly, and many of these "grew up " so that their counties were reclassified as metropolitan. Both metropolitan growth and nonmetropolitan urban growth were fueled by rural to urban migration, with the <b>reorganization</b> <b>of</b> <b>agriculture</b> and decline in labor needs in this and other extractive industries. Consequently, many rural parts of the nation experienced declining populations in this century at least prior to 1970...|$|E
