This study presents a novel multi-imaging approach combining fluorescence and neutron radiography that is able to simultaneously monitor root growth, water content distribution, root respiration and root exudation. Methods Germinated seeds of white lupins (Lupinus albus) were planted in boron-free glass <b>rhizotrons.</b> After 11 d, the <b>rhizotrons</b> were wetted from the bottom and time series of fluorescence and neutron images were taken during the subsequent day and night cycles for 13 d. The following day (i. e. 25 d after planting) the <b>rhizotrons</b> were again wetted from the bottom and the measurements were repeated. Fluorescence sensor foils were attached to the inner sides of the glass and measurements of oxygen and pH were {{made on the basis}} of fluorescence intensity. The experimental set-up allowed for simultaneous fluorescence imaging and neutron radiography. Key Results The interrelated patterns of root growth and distribution in the soil, root respiration, exudation and water uptake could all be studied non-destructively and at high temporal and spatial resolution. The older parts of the root system with greater root-length density were associated with fast decreases of water content and rapid changes in oxygen concentration. pH values around the roots located in areas with low soil water content were significantly lower than the rest of the root system. Conclusions The results suggest that the combined imaging set-up developed here, incorporating fluorescence intensity measurements, is able to map important biogeochemical parameters in the soil around living plants with a spatial resolution that is sufficiently high enough to relate the patterns observed to the root syste...|$|R
40|$|Background and aims: The genetic {{basis of}} {{increased}} rooting below the plough layer, post-anthesis in the field, {{of an elite}} wheat line (Triticum aestivum cv. Shamrock) with recent introgression from wild emmer (T. dicoccoides), is investigated. Shamrock has a non-glaucous canopy phenotype mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2 B (2 BS), derived from the wild emmer. A secondary aim {{was to determine whether}} genetic effects found in the field could have been predicted by other assessment methods. ? Methods: Roots of doubled haploid (DH) lines from a winter wheat (cv. Shamrock x Shango) population were assessed using a seedling screen in moist paper rolls, in <b>rhizotrons</b> to the end of tillering, and in the field post-anthesis. A linkage map was produced using single nucleotide polymorphism markers to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for rooting traits. ? Key results: Shamrock had greater root length density (RLD) at depth than Shango, in the field and within the <b>rhizotrons.</b> The DH population exhibited diversity for rooting traits within the three environments studied. QTL were identified on 5 D, 6 B and 7 B, explaining variation in RLD post-anthesis in the field. Effects associated with the non-glaucous trait on RLD interacted significantly with depth in the field and some of this interaction mapped to 2 BS. The effect of genotype interacted greatly with the method of root assessment: e. g. glaucousness expressed in the field was negatively associated with RLD in the <b>rhizotrons,</b> but positively associated with length in the seedling screen. ? Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify QTL for rooting at depth in field-grown wheat at mature growth stages.

Spatial heterogeneity of rhizosphere processes, mainly linked to the {{root development}} stage and to the plant species, could explain the contrasted rhizoremediation efficiency levels reported in the literature. Aim {{of the present study}} was to test if spatial variability in the whole plant rhizosphere, explored at the centimetre-scale, would influence the abundance of microorganisms (bacteria and fungi), and the abundance and activity of PAH-degrading bacteria, leading to spatial variability in PAH concentrations. Two contrasted rhizospheres were compared after 37 days of alfalfa or ryegrass growth in independent <b>rhizotron</b> devices. Almost all spiked PAHs were degraded, and the density of the PAH-degrading bacterial populations increased in both rhizospheres during the incubation period.

Mean temperature for horizontal gradient had no biological significance at the 25, 300, 600, and 1200 mm level. The 5 mm level had horizontal differences of 2. 1 C with biological significance. Soil temperatures in the root cell containers differed from the adjacent soil. Containers had higher temperatures at the 300, 600, and 1200 mm levels than the soil profile due to the observation room influence. Insulation of the root cell container reduced the observation room influence. ^ Silica sand; fritted clay; washed, river-sand; and sand/soil media had different soil temperature profiles. Fritted clay had the lowest temperatures at the 5 and 25 mm levels for the media tested. Media influence on soil temperature declined with depth. ^ Turfgrass growing in fritted clay had the greatest root length in the upper portion of the profile, but sand/soil mix had the greatest total root length.

A sand <b>rhizotron</b> system was developed to investigate Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) root responses to altered water and nitrate supply as manipulated by soil physical properties. When this system was compared to agar, root disparities were explained by differences in hydraulic properties, highlighting the importance of the soil physical component. The sand <b>rhizotron</b> system was adopted to quantify root proliferation and gene expression responses to altered water and nitrate availability in wild-type and selected mutant seedlings. In the sand <b>rhizotron</b> system, primary root length and lateral root density were oppositely regulated by water availability, but similarly independent of nitrate supply. The expression of the nitrate transporter AtNRT 2. 1 and the aquaporin AtPIP 2. 2 was coordinated across all treatments. Their concentration-dependent hydraulic regulation was confirmed for AtNRT 2. 1 by in situ imaging of a Green Fluorescent Protein reporter line. AtNAR 2. 1 and AtNRT 2. 1 expression demonstrated independent responses to water and nitrate availability despite the requirement of AtNAR 2. 1 for AtNRT 2. 1 uptake function.

Zinc (Zn) uptake by plant roots from soils low in plant-available Zn {{may be increased}} by Zn-mobilizing rhizosphere processes, including exudation of low-molecular-weight organic anions. A <b>rhizotron</b> experiment with a low Zn clay soil and a nutrient solution experiment were conducted to test if this occurs in six rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotypes varying in tolerance to low Zn supply. In both experiments, low Zn supply resulted in a marked decrease in biomass production of most genotypes compared with adequate Zn supply. The genotypes showed a significant variation in Zn efficiency. Plants responded to low Zn supply with increased root exudation of malate in both experiments. The malate concentration in the rhizosphere of three genotypes ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 59 mmol L– 1 in <b>rhizotron</b> experiment, and the malate exudation rate of five genotypes ranged from 0. 18 to 0. 53 nmol g– 1 root dw s– 1 in the nutrient solution experiment. On average, low Zn supply in the <b>rhizotron</b> experiment increased rhizosphere malate concentration by 64 % compared with that at adequate Zn supply. The averaged malate exudation rate at low Zn in the nutrient solution experiment was 40 % greater than at adequate Zn supply. The malate exudation of rice genotypes at low Zn was not correlated to Zn efficiency or Zn uptake in either experiment. Based on a soil malate extraction experiment, the observed genotypic difference in rhizosphere malate concentration {{is expected to have}} a negligible effect on the concentration of Zn in soil solution. These findings suggest that Zn mobilization by rice genotypes cannot be explained by increased malate exudation alone, indicating that other mechanisms contribute to the variation in plant Zn uptake.

The results have shown that the near-field modeled and measured GPR data perfectly match in the frequency and time domain for both dry and wet sand. In the case of dry sand, the estimated water content based on GPR and light transmission data was retrieved with small differences. Indeed, the thinness of the sand layer in the <b>rhizotron</b> involves a biggest influence of the air in the GPR signal leading to an underestimate value of the water content. This research shows the potential of the GPR system and the near-field model to accurately estimate the water content of different soils with a high spatial resolution. Future studies will focus on the use of GPR to monitor root water uptake dynamics of plants in several soils systems...|$|E
40|$|With the {{increasing}} frequency {{and magnitude of}} warmer days during the summer in the UK, bedding plants which were a traditional part of the urban green landscape are perceived as unsustainable and water-demanding. During recent summers when bans on irrigation have been imposed, use and sales of bedding plants have dropped dramatically having a negative financial impact on the nursery industry. Retaining bedding species as a feature in public and even private spaces in future may be conditional on them being managed {{in a manner that}} minimises their water use. Using Petunia x hybrida ‘Hurrah White’ we aimed to discover which irrigation approach was the most efficient for maintaining plants’ ornamental quality (flower numbers, size and longevity), shoot and root growth under water deficit and periods of complete water withdrawal. Plants were grown from plugs for 51 days in wooden <b>rhizotrons</b> (0. 35 m (h) x 0. 1 m (w) x 0. 065 m (d)); the rhizotrons’ front comprised clear Perspex which enabled us to monitor root growth closely. Irrigation treatments were: 1. watering with the amount which constitutes 50...|$|R
40|$|European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is an {{economically}} and ecologically important forest tree species in Europe. Expected future temperature increases {{due to global}} climate change may significantly affect growth of beech trees and consequently influence carbon cycling in beech forests. We tested the hypothesis that soil temperature influences the growth of both belowground and aboveground parts of beech seedlings. One-year-old seedlings were transferred into <b>rhizotrons</b> and subjected to two different soil temperatures for 2 years while the soil moisture level was kept constant. The main effect of the soil temperature was a changed biomass of the woody part of the seedlings. Soil temperature significantly influenced the biomass of shoots and roots and diameter of the stem, which were the highest for the seedlings grown in conditions of soil temperatures maintained {{in the range of}} summer soil temperatures from the site of origin of the seedlings. Increased soil temperature also resulted in increased specific root length and specific root tip density. Root-to-shoot ratio and leaf parameters (leaf mass, number of leaves, and specific leaf area), except for leaf area ratio, were not influenced by soil temperatur...|$|R
40|$|A {{remarkable}} {{facet of}} lateral root (LR) behavior is variability affecting root development, {{leading to a}} large range of LR lengths and branching densities along the primary root. It {{has been argued that}} such variability among LRs could be a strategy to optimize soil exploration in a context of spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil resources (Forde 2009). In order to characterize variability in LR growth and evaluate the role of hormonal and biochemical signals that might influence it, we analyzed the patterns of development of hundreds of lateral roots in a set of maize seedlings grown in <b>rhizotrons.</b> The SmartRoot software (Lobet et al. 2011) was used to provide a comprehensive recording of individual root elongation dynamics. Using a multivariate clustering method based on traits such as growth rates and apical root diameters, we identified a number of coherent growing states in maize LRs. This approach allows to quantify the variability of LR growth patterns in a root system in a probabilistic manner by computing the initial and transition probabilities among the different LR growing states. Moreover, the molecular and cellular characterization of apical root samples revealed consistent variations in meristem size, as well as sugar and auxin status relative to the growing state of the root...|$|R
