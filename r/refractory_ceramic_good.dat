40|$|Abstract. According to the {{practical}} physical dimension and processing parameters of ladle with bottom gas blowing in a factory, a geometrical model was established and mesh structure was completed, Eulerian multiphase model and porous media model were adopted for the two-phase flow in ladle, which was coupled, {{the effect of}} temperature field and thermal stress in course of working process of permeable-gas <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramic</b> was studied by finite element approach. The correlations between processing, structure, and high-temperature mechanical properties were discussed, and the material and structure of permeable-gas ceramic were designed to optimum. The results show that: The steady gas flow rate can avoid wearing of permeable-gas <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramic</b> from cataclysm of temperature-stress; After the material and structure of permeable-gas <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramic</b> are optimized, the effect on ceramic wearing of temperature-stress in condition of oxygen washing is weakened. It is an important guiding for prepara-tion of permeable-gas <b>refractory</b> <b>ceramic</b> with long life, which will make for highly active refining ladle...|$|R
