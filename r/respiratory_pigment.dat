5|$|The lophophore and mantle are {{the only}} {{surfaces}} that absorb oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide. Oxygen seems to be distributed by the fluid of the coelom, which is circulated through the mantle and driven either by contractions of {{the lining of the}} coelom or by beating of its cilia. In some species oxygen is partly carried by the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> hemerythrin, which is transported in coelomocyte cells.The maximum oxygen consumption of brachiopods is low, and their minimum requirement is not measurable.|$|E
5|$|Like other crustaceans, malacostracans {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} in which the heart pumps blood into the hemocoel (body cavity) where it {{supplies}} the needs of the organs for oxygen and nutrients before diffusing back to the heart. The typical <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> in malacostracans is haemocyanin. Structures that function as kidneys are located near the base of the antennae. A brain exists in the form of ganglia close to the antennae, there are ganglia in each segment and a collection of major ganglia below the oesophagus. Sensory organs include compound eyes (often stalked), ocelli (simple eyes), statocysts and sensory bristles. The naupliar eye is a characteristic of the nauplius larva and consists of four cup-shaped ocelli facing in different directions and able to distinguish between light and darkness.|$|E
50|$|The blood may be colourless, or {{have any}} of three {{different}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments.</b> The most common of these is haemoglobin, but some groups have haemerythrin or the green-coloured chlorocruorin, instead.|$|R
50|$|In many invertebrates, these oxygen-carrying {{proteins}} are {{freely soluble}} in the blood; in vertebrates they {{are contained in}} specialized red blood cells, allowing for a higher concentration of <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> without increasing viscosity or damaging blood filtering organs like the kidneys.|$|R
50|$|Cytochromes were {{initially}} described in 1884 by MacMunn as <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> (myohematin or histohematin). In the 1920s, Keilin rediscovered these <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> and named them the cytochromes, or “cellular pigments”, and classified these heme proteins, {{on the basis}} of the position of their lowest energy absorption band in the reduced state, ascytochromes a (605 nm), b (~565 nm), and c (550 nm). The ultra-violet (UV) to visible spectroscopic signatures of hemes are still used to identify heme type from the reduced bis-pyridine-ligated state, i.e., the pyridine hemochrome method. Within each class, cytochrome a, b, or c, early cytochromes are numbered consecutively, e.g. cyt c, cyt c1, and cyt c2, with more recent examples designated by their reduced state R-band maximum, e.g. cyt c559.|$|R
5|$|Molluscs' circulatory {{systems are}} mainly open. Although {{molluscs}} are coelomates, their coeloms {{are reduced to}} fairly small spaces enclosing the heart and gonads. The main body cavity is a hemocoel through which blood and coelomic fluid circulate and which encloses {{most of the other}} internal organs. These hemocoelic spaces act as an efficient hydrostatic skeleton. The blood contains the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> hemocyanin as an oxygen-carrier. The heart consists of one or more pairs of atria (auricles), which receive oxygenated blood from the gills and pump it to the ventricle, which pumps it into the aorta (main artery), which is fairly short and opens into the hemocoel.|$|E
5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders are coelomates {{in which}} the coelom is reduced to small areas round the {{reproductive}} and excretory systems. Its place is largely taken by a hemocoel, a cavity that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows. The heart is a tube in {{the upper part of the}} body, with a few ostia that act as non-return valves allowing blood to enter the heart from the hemocoel but prevent it from leaving before it reaches the front end. However, in spiders, it occupies only the upper part of the abdomen, and blood is discharged into the hemocoel by one artery that opens at the rear end of the abdomen and by branching arteries that pass through the pedicle and open into several parts of the cephalothorax. Hence spiders have open circulatory systems. The blood of many spiders that have book lungs contains the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> hemocyanin to make oxygen transport more efficient.|$|E
500|$|Arthropods {{and most}} mollusks {{have an open}} circulatory system. In this system, deoxygenated blood {{collects}} around the heart in cavities (...) [...] This blood slowly permeates the heart through many small one-way channels. The heart then pumps the blood into the hemocoel, a cavity between the organs. The heart in arthropods is typically a muscular tube that runs {{the length of the}} body, under the back and {{from the base of the}} head. Instead of blood the circulatory fluid is haemolymph which carries the most commonly used <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment,</b> copper-based haemocyanin as the oxygen transporter; iron-based haemoglobin is used by only a few arthropods.|$|E
40|$|The Bohr effect, {{which can}} be most {{generally}} defined as the influence of pH on the oxygen binding affinity of proteins, is a common feature of <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments,</b> ranging from the haemocyanins of molluscs and crustaceans to the haemoglobins of vertebrates. Its physiological role is generally seen in the facilitation of oxygen release from <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> during tissue acidosis. The magnitude of the effect can be influenced by a multitude of factors such as temperature, carbon dioxide, chloride ions, organic phosphates and the investigated pH range. Here we present data on the maximal alkaline Bohr effect in haemoglobins from {{a large number of}} species covering all vertebrate classes, obtained at physiological temperatures in the presence of 100 mM chloride ions and the absence of carbon dioxide and organic phosphates...|$|R
40|$|High nitrite {{concentrations}} in freshwater ecosystems may cause toxicity to aquatic animals. These living organisms can take nitrite up from water through their chloride cells, subsequently suffering oxidation of their <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> (hemoglobin, hemocyanin). Because NO 2 ¿ and Cl¿ ions {{compete for the}} same active transport site, elevated chloride {{concentrations in}} the aquatic environment have the potential of reducing nitrite toxicity. Although this ameliorating effect is well documented in fish, it has been largely ignored in wild freshwater invertebrates. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the ameliorating effect of chloride on nitrite toxicity to two species of freshwater invertebrates differing in physiology: Eulimnogammarus toletanus (amphipods) and Polycelis felina (planarians). The former species presents gills (with chloride cells) and <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments,</b> whereas in the latter species these are absent. Test animals were exposed in triplicate for 168 h to a single nitrite concentration (5 ppm NO 2 -N for E. toletanus and 100 ppm NO 2 -N for P. felina) at four different environmental chloride concentrations (27. 8, 58. 3, 85. 3, and 108. 0 ppm Cl¿). The number of dead animals and the number of affected individuals (i. e., number of dead plus inactive invertebrates) were monitored every day. LT 50 (lethal time) and ET 50 (effective time) were estimated for each species and each chloride concentration. LT 50 and ET 50 values increased with increases in the environmental chloride concentration, mainly in amphipods. Results clearly show that the ameliorating effect of chloride on nitrite toxicity was more significant in amphipods than in planarians, likely because of the absence of gills (with chloride cells) and <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> in P. felina. Additionally, this comparative study indicates that the ecological risk assessment of nitrite in freshwater ecosystems should take into account not only the most sensitive and key species in the communities, but also chloride levels in the aquatic environmen...|$|R
50|$|The {{vascular}} system {{consists of two}} main vessels connected by lateral vessels in each segment. Blood is carried forward in the dorsal vessel (in {{the upper part of}} the body) and back through the ventral vessel (underneath), before passing into a sinus surrounding the intestine. Some of the smaller vessels are muscular, effectively forming hearts; from one to five pairs of such hearts is typical. The blood of oligochaetes contains haemoglobin in all but the smallest of species, which have no need of <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments.</b>|$|R
50|$|Gastropods have open {{circulatory system}} and the {{transport}} fluid is hemolymph. Hemocyanin {{is present in the}} hemolymph as the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cyanoglobin (or GlbN): a {{truncated}} haemoprotein {{found in}} cyanobacteria that has high oxygen affinity, and {{which appears to}} serve {{as part of a}} terminal oxidase, rather than as a <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment.</b>|$|E
50|$|Arthropods have open circulatory systems, {{although}} most {{have a few}} short, open-ended arteries. In chelicerates and crustaceans, the blood carries oxygen to the tissues, while hexapods use a separate system of tracheae. Many crustaceans, but few chelicerates and tracheates, use respiratory pigments to assist oxygen transport. The most common <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> in arthropods is copper-based hemocyanin; this is used by many crustaceans and a few centipedes. A few crustaceans and insects use iron-based hemoglobin, the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> used by vertebrates. As with other invertebrates, the respiratory pigments of those arthropods that have them are generally dissolved in the blood and rarely enclosed in corpuscles {{as they are in}} vertebrates.|$|E
5000|$|D. cuprea is an {{omnivore}} and scavenger; {{it feeds}} on algae {{as well as}} on small invertebrates such as copepods, gastropod molluscs, barnacle larvae and hooded shrimps, some of which tend to grow on the exterior of the tube. The worm can turn round inside the tube, and this seems to serve as a food-gathering device as well as a home. The worm actively creates a flow of water through the tube to increase oxygenation, and haemoglobins in the interstitial fluid are used as <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments.</b>|$|R
40|$|The phenazines are a {{class of}} over 150 {{nitrogen-containing}} aromatic compounds of bacterial and archeal origin. Their redox properties not only explain their activity as broad-specificity antibiotics and virulence factors but also enable them to function as <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments,</b> thus extending their importance to the primary metabolism of phenazine-producing species. Despite their discovery in the mid- 19 th century, the molecular mechanisms behind their biosynthesis have only been unraveled in the last decade.

The work presented here thus demonstrates that a suite of physiological and whole organism variables influence contest behaviour in hermit crabs, and that both aerobic and performance capacities are very important in determining agonistic success.

50|$|Other {{invertebrates}} use respiratory proteins {{to increase}} the oxygen-carrying capacity. Hemoglobin {{is the most common}} respiratory protein found in nature.

40|$|Present {{knowledge}} would {{attribute to}} proteins {{a wider range}} of biological activity than is possessed by any other group of natural substances. Thus enzymes, <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments,</b> antibodies, many antigens, and several hormones are protein in nature. Sometimes the biologically active substance is a simple protein, consisting of amino acid residues only (papain, carboxypeptidase, lysozyme, insulin, glucagon,, 8 -corticotropin, etc.). In other cases the protein is conjugated with nonprotein material as in the photosynthetic <b>pigments,</b> <b>respiratory</b> enzymes, the oxygen carriers haemoglobin and chlorocruorin, the gonadotropic hormones, Castle's intrinsic factor, blood group substances, virus haemagglutinin inhibitors, and others. Whereas it is well established that the haem iron in haematoproteins provides the active centre, and that flavin adenine mononucleotide and dinucleotide, respectively, are the functional groups of catalytically active flavoproteins, the literature provides little, if any, information about the structural element responsible for the biological activity of mucoproteins, i. e., carbohydrate-protein complexe...|$|R
40|$|The P 50 Depth Analysis v 1. 0 calculates blood-oxygen binding, {{which is}} a {{mechanism}} determining hypoxia tolerance in the ocean. Blood-oxygen binding is measured as the oxygen pressure in the blood at which whole blood is 50 % oxygenated, called P 50. A low P 50 means that <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> {{in the blood of}} an organism equilibrate to 100 % oxygenation at lower oxygen pressures, and the organism is more hypoxia tolerant. Temperature alters hypoxia tolerance by shifting the P 50 of organisms. The effect of temperature is measured as the heat of oxygenation (ΔH) which is the amount of heat energy released (negative ΔH) or absorbed (positive ΔH) when oxygen binds to <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments.</b> Marine organisms swim between warmer, well-oxygenated waters near the surface of the ocean and colder, less-oxygenated waters in the deeper ocean. This analysis assumes P 50 acclimation to temperatures at 10 m depth in the mixed layer. P 50 in the water column can be determined relative to P 50 at 10 m depth using the Van't Hoff equation and oxygen pressure and temperature data. The P 50 depth is defined as the shallowest depth in the ocean where pO 2 = P 50. This code calculates P 50 depths for the global ocean.

50|$|Tunicates have a {{well-developed}} {{heart and}} circulatory system. The {{heart is a}} double U-shaped tube situated just below the gut. The blood vessels are simple connective tissue tubes, and their blood has several types of corpuscle. The blood may appear pale green, {{but this is not}} due to any <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments,</b> and oxygen is transported dissolved in the plasma. Exact details of the circulatory system are unclear, but the gut, pharynx, gills, gonads, and nervous system seem to be arranged in series rather than in parallel, as happens in most other animals. Every few minutes, the heart stops beating and then restarts, pumping fluid in the reverse direction.|$|R
50|$|There {{is a wide}} body-cavity, {{which has}} no {{connection}} with the renal or reproductive organs, {{so it is not}} a coelom; it is probably a blood-space or hemocoel.

50|$|The {{majority}} of gastropods have haemolymph containing the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> haemocyanin. This is a copper-containing protein {{that helps to}} carry oxygen, and gives the haemolymph a pale blue colour. In the freshwater Planorbid snails, however, the haemocyanin is replaced by haemoglobin, and thus their haemolymph is red rather than blue. Some gastropods, such as the sea hare Aplysia, appear to lack respiratory pigments altogether.|$|E
5000|$|Octopuses use {{hemocyanin}} {{as their}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment,</b> which binds oxygen through copper {{rather than the}} iron used by our own hemoglobin. Blood volume in the octopus’ body is about 3.5% of its body weight but the blood’s oxygen carrying capacity is only about 4 volume percent. This contributes to their susceptibility to the oxygen debt mentioned before. Shadwick and Nilsson concluded that the octopus circulatory system is “fundamentally unsuitable for high physiologic performance.” ...|$|E
40|$|Examples of the {{two main}} classes of {{circulating}} <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> (heme pigments and hemocyanins) {{have been found in}} four typical members of the deep-sea hydrothermal vent communities. The studies now in progress concern the hemoglobin of Calyptogena; the erythrocruorins of Alvinella and Riftia; and the hemocyanin of Bythograea. This paper summarizes the available data of the molecular structure of these pigments and the functional properties allowing some of them to fix and transport oxygen, sulphide and carbon dioxide. The erythrocruorins of Riftia are the most conspicuous of these respiratory proteins since they {{seem to be able to}} carry oxygen and sulphide simultaneously, these substances being fixed at two different sites of the pigment molecule...|$|R
40|$|After a {{transition}} from high to low oxygen tension, there was a twofold to 50 -fold increase {{in the content of}} membrane-bound <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> of Haemophilus parainfluenzae, and there were concurrent changes in the metabolism of the membrane phospholipids: (i) a twofold decrease in the rate of turnover of the phosphate in all the phospholipids; (ii) a shift from simple one-phase, linear incorporation of phosphate into phospholipids to a complex biphasic incorporation of phosphate into phospholipids; and (iii) an increase in the total phospholipids with a slight increase in the proportion of phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and a slight decrease in the proportion of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Changes in the rates of incorporation of phosphate into the phospholipids occurred without a change in the rate of bacterial growth. When the compensatory adjustment of the proportions of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> reached a steady state, the total phospholipid, the rate of incorporation of phosphate into phospholipids, and the proportion of PG fell. At steady-state proportions of cytochromes, the proportion of PE and the rate of turnover of the phosphate in the phospholipids increased. All through an incorporation experiment of 1. 5 divisions, the specific activity of the phosphate of PG was twice that of phosphatidic acid (PA). The phosphate of PG turned over 1. 2 to 1. 5 times more rapidly than the phosphate of PA in cells with high and low cytochrome levels. If the PA was an accurate measure of the precursor for the cytidine- 5 ′-diphosphate-diglyceride, which in turn was the precursor of all the lipids, then the results of these experiments suggested that exchange reactions, in addition to synthesis from PA, were involved in phospholipid metabolism. These reactions were more sensitive to changes in oxygen concentration than was the growth rate...|$|R
40|$|Satisfactory {{extraction}} and assay {{procedures have}} been developed for the lipids of Staphylococcus aureus. The following lipids have been characterized in detail: the vitamin K 2, which is shown to exist as isoprenologues with side chains of 35, 40, and 45 carbon atoms; monoglucosyldiglyceride and diglucosyldiglyceride, which account for all the carbohydrate in the lipid extracts; the lysyl ester of phosphatidyl glycerol, phosphatidyl glycerol, and cardiolipin, which account for 98 % of the phosphate in the lipid extract. The extraction procedure removes 98 % of the total bacterial fatty acids. Acidification of the medium before harvest and refluxing in isopropanol are critical in the extraction procedure for the maximal recovery of lysyl-phosphatidyl glycerol and the glucolipids.

50|$|The {{fluid in}} the coelomata {{contains}} coelomocyte cells that defend the animals against parasites and infections. In some species coelomocytes may also contain a <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> - red hemoglobin in some species, green chlorocruorin in others (dissolved in the plasma) - and provide oxygen transport within their segments. <b>Respiratory</b> <b>pigment</b> is also dissolved {{in the blood}} plasma. Species with well-developed septa generally also have blood vessels running all long their bodies {{above and below the}} gut, the upper one carrying blood forwards while the lower one carries it backwards. Networks of capillaries in the body wall and around the gut transfer blood between the main blood vessels and to parts of the segment that need oxygen and nutrients. Both of the major vessels, especially the upper one, can pump blood by contracting. In some annelids the forward end of the upper blood vessel is enlarged with muscles to form a heart, while in the forward ends of many earthworms some of the vessels that connect the upper and lower main vessels function as hearts. Species with poorly developed or no septa generally have no blood vessels and rely on the circulation within the coelom for delivering nutrients and oxygen.|$|E

Two copper atoms are needed to bind one O2 molecule. Because it is a large protein molecule it is found in the blood plasma but is not found in body tissues or muscles. Hemocyanins are named appropriately because when oxygenated their color changes from colorless to blue.|$|E
40|$|By {{increasing}} {{further the}} sensitivity of microspectrophotometry, {{it is now possible}} to measure, under favorable conditions, the smaller absorption bands of the <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments</b> of single cells in the visible region of the spectrum. A considerable aid in the distinction between cytochromes is afforded by liquid nitrogen microspectrophotometry. Under favorable conditions, the height of the peaks is increased over 8 -fold at low temperatures. In diploid yeast, characteristically sharpened components not resolvable at room temperature are observed at low temperature; and in pentaploid yeast, a hitherto unrecognized pigment is observed at 583 m/z. These preliminary results indicate the feasibility and the value of low temperature microspectrophotometry of biological materials. Using the microspectroscope and cooling the preparation down to liquid nitrogen temperature, Keilin and Hartree (1) were able to observe more clearly the absorption peaks in the region of the c ~ bands of the cytochromes.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of extracellular hemoglobins of annelids, vestimentiferans, and pogonophorans was investigated by applying cladistic and distance-based approaches {{to reconstruct the}} phylogenetic relationships of this group of <b>respiratory</b> <b>pigments.</b> We performed this study using the aligned sequences of globin and linker chains that are the constituents of these complex molecules. Three novel globin and two novel linker chains of Sabella spallanzanii described in an accompanying paper (Pallavicini, A., Negrisolo, E., Barbato, R., Dewilde, S., Ghiretti-Magaldi, A., Moens, L., and Lanfranchi, G.

Our results allowed us to test previous hypotheses on the evolutionary pathways of these proteins and to formulate a new most parsimonious model of molecular evolution.

Cytochromes a and a 3 {{could be}} resolved spectrally in the α-band region {{by reducing the}} cells {{in the presence of}} methanol and cyanide. Methanol shifted the absorption maximum of cytochrome a from 598 to 603 nanometers and permitted dithionite (or substrate) to reduce the cyanide-cytochrome a 3 complex to give a well defined 595 -nanometer absorption band. Methanol did not interfere with CO binding by cytochrome a 3, and CO did not alter the methanol effect on cytochrome a. Azide and cyanide, which partially inhibited exogenous respiration, stimulated endogenous respiration. Frozen steady states of the electron transport chain in the presence of cyanide and azide indicated that the stimulation by these inhibitors was due to an increased autooxidation of one of the b-type cytochromes, possibly b(564) ...|$|R
