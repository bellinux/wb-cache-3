40|$|We model {{imperfect}} contract enforcement when <b>repudiators</b> {{and their}} victims default to spot trading. The {{interaction between the}} contract and spot markets under improved enforcement can exacerbate repudiation and reduce contract execution, harming all traders. Improved contract execution benefits traders on the excess side of the spot market by attracting potential counter-parties, but harms them by impeding their exit from contracts found to be unfavorable. Multiple equilibria and multiple optima are possible, with anarchy a local optimum, perfect enforcement a local minimum and imperfect enforcement a global optimum. LDCs exhibit parameter combinations such that imperfect enforcement is optimal from their side of international markets. The model thus rationalizes the internationally varying patterns of imperfect enforceability observable in survey data. ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Darul Islam" [...] is {{otherwise}} known as [...] "Darul Salam". [...] "Daru Islam" [...] means the [...] "Land of Islam" [...] while [...] "Darul Salam" [...] means the [...] "Land of peace". Actually,the organization tends to uphold certain doctrines which is not inline with the general believe of majority Muslims in Nigeria. These doctrines will shed more lights on the creed and belief that the members tend to uphold. First, the organization believes that the human society generally and specifically Nigerian society has been corrupted with atrocious indecencies and licentiousness. This corruption militates against the real practice of Islam, hence, {{it is necessary to}} migrate to the [...] "Land of Islam" [...] or [...] "Land of peace" [...] where Islamic injunctions will be devotedly practiced. This is where the organization derives the name [...] "Darul Islam" [...] or otherwise called [...] "Darul Salam".Second, Darul Islam's doctrine is that all Muslims are infidels until they profess the word of testimony, i.e. there is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His messenger. By this, it means that being a Muslim is not sufficed by virtue of imitation from parents or being born as a Muslim. Therefore, in professing the word of testimony, it is integrally considered as a prerequisite to migrate to [...] "Darul Islam" [...] and make pledge (Bai'ah) with the leader. Whosoever makes the pledge and subsequently violates or revolts the pledge and denounces the membership of the organization, such person has indeed become a <b>repudiator</b> of his faith. However, no report has been received pertaining to the extent of practicality and application of these doctrines at the village where the members are living.|$|E
5000|$|It {{was against}} this {{backdrop}} that Sifton announced his government's policy {{with respect to the}} Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Company. Because it had failed to meet its construction obligations, Sifton introduced legislation to confiscate the proceeds of the sale of government-guaranteed bonds sold to finance the railway's construction. [...] He gave no indication of how the money, which was being held in trust by several banks, would be used. [...] Cross's faction of (primarily northern) Liberals opposed the bill {{on the grounds that it}} did not commit the government to using the money to construct the railway, while the Conservatives opposed it as an unjustified confiscation of private property. [...] As Conservative R. B. Bennett said,bill is an act of confiscation, an act such as never before has been carried out in the British Empire, an act such as has few equals in the pages of history. Similar acts have been carried out, once in Nicaragua and Virginia, and in South Carolina and only in times of war or revolution ... In my opinion the bargain was an improvident one, but that does not justify confiscation ... I did not think the new road would pay. But it is a new doctrine that because a bargain did not pay it should be repudiated and one should become a <b>repudiator</b> of bargains and a confiscator of private rights.In speaking of A&GW President William Clarke (an American), Bennett went on to say [...] "Clarke I despise but Clarke I am bound to respect, because this province gave him a right by charter and if I know the United States I do not think it will allow this province to take his property without due process of the law." [...] The Conservatives, however, had not been expected to support the legislation; the real question was whether Sifton could command enough support among Liberals to pass it. After all, during the Alberta and Great Waterways crisis only nine months earlier, a legislature of very similar makeup had endorsed the Rutherford government's handling of railway policy by a vote of twenty-three votes to fifteen; would Sifton's bill, effectively a repudiation of the Rutherford policy, convince enough Liberals to change sides? [...] The answer came in December, when the bill passed third reading by a vote of twenty-five votes to fourteen. [...] Nine Liberals had reversed themselves and saved Sifton's government, though both Cross and Rutherford were among those to vote against it.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} main points that Ulysses S. Grant puts {{forward in his}} Inauguration Address, which he has entirely written on his own. Grant starts off his Inauguration Address by {{discussing}} how the laws should be enforced and what an ideal executive branch should look like,"On all leading questions agitating the public mind I will always express my views to Congress and urge them according to my judgment, and when I think it advisable will exercise the constitutional privilege of interposing a veto to defeat measures which I oppose; but all laws will be faithfully executed, whether they meet my approval or not.I shall on all subjects have a policy to recommend, but none to enforce against {{the will of the}} people. Laws are to govern all alike--those opposed {{as well as those who}} favor them. I know no method to secure the repeal of bad or obnoxious laws so effective as their stringent execution."Grant then goes into the Civil War and reassures the American citizens that he will fight to retire the debt from the war. [...] "A great debt has been contracted in securing to us and our posterity the Union. The payment of this, principal and interest, as well as the return to a specie basis as soon as it can be accomplished without material detriment to the debtor class or to the country at large, must be provided for. To protect the national honor, every dollar of Government indebtedness should be paid in gold, unless otherwise expressly stipulated in the contract. Let it be understood that no <b>repudiator</b> of one farthing of our public debt will be trusted in public place, and it will go far toward strengthening a credit which ought to be the best in the world, and will ultimately enable us to replace the debt with bonds bearing less interest than we now pay. To this should be added a faithful collection of the revenue, a strict accountability to the Treasury for every dollar collected, and the greatest practicable retrenchment in expenditure in every department of Government."Lastly, Grant fully endorses the Fifteenth Amendment, which is ratified in 1870, granting African Americans suffrage rights. [...] "The question of suffrage is one which is likely to agitate the public so long as a portion of the citizens of the nation are excluded from its privileges in any State. It seems to me very desirable that this question should be settled now, and I entertain the hope and express the desire that it may be by the ratification of the fifteenth article of amendment to the Constitution." ...|$|E
5000|$|Although his family's mercantile {{background}} {{had shown}} Swanson {{the importance of}} credit, his views (and those of his allies) outraged the conservative creditor class. Railroad developer Joseph F. Bryan, who owned the Richmond Times analogized Swanson to communists, anarchists and <b>repudiators</b> of debt." [...] Congressman Swanson also endorsed free rural mail delivery, aid to rural banks, graduated federal income taxes (that became the 16th Amendment), reduced federal excise taxes and direct election of U.S. Senators (that became the 17th Amendment). He rose to influence on the House Ways and Means Committee and as proto-party whip. When the Spanish-American War in 1898 stimulated demand for farm products, the family farms again prospered and his brothers opened a wholesale grocery in Danville.|$|R
40|$|Investments in {{enterprise}} {{social networks}} (ESNs) have increased rapidly in recent years. However, an ESN utilization intensity develops slowly, {{and there are}} a few well-grounded approaches to understand ESN usage. To elaborate on different archetypes of ESN users, we conducted a case study that comprised 28 interviews with a large IT services company. We present a model to characterize ESN users and classify them as archetypes based on the following two dimensions: individual openness to ESNs and perceived task-fit. We determine six archetypes of ESN users, namely, power users, limited users, reluctant users, <b>repudiators,</b> hidden champions, and question marks. From a theoretical viewpoint, this study contributes to the discussion around user typology of ESN users and the utilization intensity, acceptance, and value contribution of ESNs. In practice, results provide an orientation to organizations that intend to address both ESN users and the organization to increase the utilization intensity of ESNs...|$|R
