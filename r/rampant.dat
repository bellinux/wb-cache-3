5|$|Although not {{represented}} {{in the form of}} a flag, the No. 602 (City of Glasgow) Squadron of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force uses the Saltire surmounted by a lion <b>rampant</b> as the device shown on the squadron crest. The station crest of the former RAF Leuchars, Fife, also showed the Saltire, in this case surmounted by a sword. The crest of the former RAF East Fortune, East Lothian, also showed a sword surmounting the Saltire, however unlike Leuchars this sword was shown inverted, and the station crest of the former RAF Turnhouse, Edinburgh, showed a Saltire surmounted by an eagle's head. The East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron crest features a Saltire surmounted by an open book; the book itself being supported by red lions <b>rampant.</b>|$|E

5|$|Incredibly, 20 years later, {{the aquatic}} {{ecologist}} J. O. Langtry was still compelled to criticise the extremely heavy, lawless, fishing pressure, {{in the form}} of both uncontrolled small-scale commercial fishing and <b>rampant</b> illegal fishing, with which he was confronted in all reaches of the Murray River he investigated in 1949–1950.|$|E

5|$|After {{the opening}} up of China from the 1980s, tomb robbery was <b>rampant</b> and many {{artifacts}} were looted and smuggled {{across the border}} to Hong Kong, then a British territory. Ma Chengyuan was active in recovering many of the items from the Hong Kong antique market. In 1992, he purchased the 3,000-year-old Jin Hou Su bianzhong (晉侯穌鐘), which were listed by the Chinese government {{as one of the first}} 64 national treasures forbidden to be exhibited abroad in 2002.|$|E
5|$|As Prince of Wales, Charles's {{coat of arms}} was {{the royal}} arms (which he later inherited), differenced by a label of three points Argent. His arms as monarch were: Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion <b>rampant</b> within a double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or {{stringed}} Argent (for Ireland).|$|E

In 1702, Anne adopted the motto semper eadem ("always the same"), the same motto used by Queen Elizabeth I.|$|E
5|$|Concurrently, Bangui {{also became}} the key centre {{for social and}} {{cultural}} activity in the region, when new institutions were established in the city. However, political turmoil in the country, <b>rampant</b> corruption, and the dictatorial rule of President Bokassa centred in the city, brought in economic recession in the 1970s exacerbated by a fall in international prices for its major exports. This caused impoverishment {{of the people and}} severe conflict, further compounded by refugees migrating from troubled neighbouring countries.|$|E
5|$|Genetic {{recombination}} is {{the process}} by which a strand of DNA is broken and then joined {{to the end of a}} different DNA molecule. This can occur when viruses infect cells simultaneously and studies of viral evolution have shown that recombination has been <b>rampant</b> in the species studied. Recombination is common to both RNA and DNA viruses.|$|E
5|$|Other {{characters}} in the Arthurian legends are described with coats of arms. Lancelot starts with plain white arms but later receives a shield with three bends gules signifying the strength of three men (Brault 47). Tristran was attributed a variety of arms. His earliest arms, a gold lion <b>rampant</b> on red field, are shown {{in a set of}} 13th-century tiles found in Chertsey Abbey (Loomis 1915, 308). Thomas of Britain in the 12th century attributed these arms (Loomis 1938, 47) in what is believed to be heraldic flattery of his patron, either Richard I or Henry II, whose coats of arms contained some form of lion (Loomis 1922, 26). In other versions the field is not red, but green. Gottfried von Strassburg attributed to Tristan a silver shield with a black boar <b>rampant</b> (Loomis 1922, 24; Loomis 1938, 49). In Italy, however, he was attributed geometric patterns (argent a bend gules per Loomis 1938, 59).|$|E
5|$|Outside Scotland, the blazon for the shield—also {{used on the}} Royal Standard—is: Quarterly: I and IV, Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II, Or, a lion <b>rampant</b> {{within a}} double tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III, Azure, a harp Or {{stringed}} Argent (for Ireland). In Scotland, the first and fourth quarters are occupied by the Scottish lion, and the second by the English lions. The crests, mottoes, and supporters also differ in and outside Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Skilling {{believed}} that if employees were constantly worried about cost, it would hinder original thinking. As a result, extravagant spending was <b>rampant</b> throughout the company, especially among the executives. Employees had large expense accounts and many executives were paid sometimes {{twice as much as}} competitors. In 1998, the top 200 highest-paid employees received $193 million from salaries, bonuses, and stock. Two years later, the figure jumped to $1.4 billion.|$|E
5|$|The arms used in England were: Quarterly, I and IV, {{quarterly}} 1st and 4th Azure three fleurs de lys Or (for France), 2nd and 3rd Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion <b>rampant</b> {{within a}} tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland, {{this was the}} first time that Ireland was included in the royal arms). The supporters became: dexter a lion <b>rampant</b> guardant Or imperially crowned and sinister the Scottish unicorn. The unicorn replaced the red dragon of Cadwaladr, which was introduced by the Tudors. The unicorn has remained in the royal arms of the two united realms. The English crest and motto was retained. The compartment often contained a branch of the Tudor rose, with shamrock and thistle engrafted on the same stem. The arms were frequently shown with James's personal motto, Beati pacifici.|$|E
5|$|The disease runs most <b>rampant</b> in the {{subtropical}} {{conditions which}} encourage reproduction of its mosquito vectors among which Culex tarsalis is most significant. Mortality rates {{appear to be}} higher than those in other birds, causing local population losses of up to 72% in a single season. Because of this, American crows are a sentinel species indicating the presence of West Nile virus in an area. Crows cannot transmit the virus to humans directly.|$|E
5|$|The post-expansion {{financial}} crisis would eventually elicit {{a response from}} the NFL. By the end of 1996, speculation was <b>rampant</b> that if the NFL placed a franchise in Toronto, it would {{mean the end of}} the CFL. Instead, in exchange for a new player agreement between the leagues, the NFL provided the CFL franchises with marketing assistance and a $3 million loan in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The shirts worn by {{players of}} Ipswich Town did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design {{featuring}} a gold lion <b>rampant</b> guardant {{on a red}} background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned {{as the result of}} a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{spread of}} disease was {{significantly}} more <b>rampant</b> {{in areas of}} poverty. Epidemics ravaged cities, particularly children. Plagues were easily spread by lice, unsanitary drinking water, armies, or by poor sanitation. Children were hit the hardest because many diseases, such as typhus and syphilis, target the immune system, leaving young children without a fighting chance. Children in city dwellings were more affected by the spread of disease than {{the children of the}} wealthy.|$|E
5|$|Under the power-sharing agreement, {{a number}} of limited reforms were passed. In early 2009, Mugabe's {{government}} declared that—to combat <b>rampant</b> inflation—it would recognise U.S. dollars as legal tender and would pay government employees in this currency. This helped to stabilise prices. ZANU-PF blogged many of the proposed reforms although a new constitution was passed in March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Vijender participated at the 2009 World Amateur Boxing Championships. He {{was beaten}} by Abbos Atoev of Uzbekistan in the semi-final of the 75kg Middleweight category, by 7 points to 3 and was thus awarded the bronze medal. Vijender {{won the first}} round of the bout 1–0, only for Atoev to run <b>rampant</b> in the second, landing five {{unanswered}} blows. The third round was evenly contested with both fighters scoring on a couple of occasions, but Vijender had already lost the match.|$|E
5|$|After the American Revolutionary War, {{the brand-new}} United States {{struggled}} to stay financially afloat. National income was desperately needed and most came from tariffs on imported goods. Because of <b>rampant</b> smuggling, the need was immediate for strong enforcement of tariff laws. On 4 August 1790 the United States Congress, urged on by Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton, created the Revenue-Marine, the forerunner for the United States Coast Guard, {{to enforce the}} tariff and all other maritime laws. Ten cutters were initially ordered. Between 1790 and 1797 when the Navy Department was created, the Revenue-Marine was the only armed maritime service for the United States.|$|E
5|$|After the {{completion}} by the 2015 Group {{takeover of the}} club, a new crest was adopted. It was still based on the Stockport coat of arms, though the Animo et Fide motto was removed, along with a patch of green {{at the base of}} the badge; the flag of Cheshire, featuring a sword and three wheatsheaves, replaced the golden lozenges and crosslets in the shield. The medals hanging from the lion's <b>rampant</b> (which represented Cheshire and Lancashire, owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed. It also saw the return of a football on the shield. This change was made in part because as of the 2010–11 season, Stockport County was sponsored by the Metropolitan Borough Council.|$|E
5|$|As Duke of York, Charles {{bore the}} royal {{arms of the}} kingdom differenced by a label Argent of three points, each bearing three torteaux Gules. The Prince of Wales bore the royal arms differenced by a plain label Argent of three points. As king, Charles bore the royal arms undifferenced: Quarterly, I and IV Grandquarterly, Azure three fleurs-de-lis Or (for France) and Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion <b>rampant</b> within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or {{stringed}} Argent (for Ireland). In Scotland, the Scottish arms {{were placed in the}} first and fourth quarters with the English and French arms in the second quarter.|$|E
5|$|As King of Scots, James {{bore the}} ancient royal arms of Scotland: Or, a lion <b>rampant</b> Gules armed and langued Azure within a double tressure flory counter-flory Gules. The arms were {{supported}} by two unicorns Argent armed, crined and unguled Proper, gorged with a coronet Or composed of crosses patée and fleurs de lys a chain affixed thereto passing between the forelegs and reflexed over the back also Or. The crest was a lion sejant affrontée Gules, imperially crowned Or, holding in the dexter paw a sword and in the sinister paw a sceptre both erect and Proper.|$|E
5|$|By 1972 FANK was decimated, {{the road}} and rail {{networks}} were smashed, and inflation was <b>rampant.</b> The rice harvest plunged from 3.8million tons in 1969 to 493,000 tons in 1973. Popular {{support for the war}} against the North Vietnamese and the insurgents had completely evaporated. The Americans, negotiating with the North Vietnamese, had proposed an Indochina-wide cease fire as part of the final settlement of the conflict in South Vietnam. By that time, however, Hanoi could make no commitment on behalf of its Cambodian allies.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s and 1980s, the New York City Subway was at {{an all-time}} low. Ridership had dropped to 1910s levels, and {{graffiti}} and crime were <b>rampant</b> on the subway; in general, the subway was very poorly maintained during that time, and delays and track problems were common. Still, the NYCTA managed to open six new subway stations in the 1980s, make the current fleet of subway cars graffiti-free, as well as order 1,775 new subway cars. By the early 1990s, conditions had improved significantly, although maintenance backlogs accumulated during those 20 years are still being fixed today.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's regular kit colours are {{royal blue}} shirts and shorts with white socks. The club's crest {{has been changed}} several times in {{attempts}} to re-brand the club and modernise its image. The current crest, featuring a ceremonial lion <b>rampant</b> regardant holding a staff, is a modification of the one introduced in the early 1950s. The club have the sixth-highest average all-time attendance in English football. Their average home gate for the 2016–17 season was 41,507, the sixth highest in the Premier League. Since 2003, Chelsea have been owned by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich. In 2016, they were ranked by Forbes magazine as the seventh most valuable football club in the world, at £1.15billion ($1.66billion).|$|E
