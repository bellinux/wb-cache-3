40|$|Even {{with the}} most {{communicative}} approach, the foreign language classroom is limited {{in its ability to}} develop learner’s communicative competence in the target language. This is due to the <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> <b>exposure</b> to the variety of functions and discourse types occurring inside the classroom. Given such limitation to develop their competence and the constraint time the learners ’ interest to speak up may become low. Having seen these phenomena, a responsible teacher should maximize opportunities for learner’s participation outside the classroom such as interview and chat in natural communication tasks. To improve learners ’ speaking skill, this research is carried out to find out the problems of natural communication using the target language in oral interview and written chat messaging. And the appropriate research for teachers is an action research. By following a four-part process, teachers can use conversation and discourse analytic techniques to analyze the difficulties of communication in the language. The data are analyzed under the scope of grammatical, sociolinguistics, strategic and discourse competence. Meanwhile, the chat data are analyzed on the basis of turn-taking, sequencing and repairing. Finally, the mapping of the learners ’ speaking proficiency is attributed as intermediate-low, and relevant materials such as CCU are recommended...|$|E

However, the Commission had not rejected the possibility of a threshold for stochastic effects. At this time the rad and rem were introduced for absorbed dose and RBE-weighted dose respectively.|$|R

40|$|The {{cellular}} phone microwave radiation can induce reversible unspecific adaptive responses {{if it is}} short and the organism is very radiosensitive. A long-term exposure (over one year) combined with the organism weakened immune system may produce a cumulative effect {{in the form of}} stress responses, various damages and, in some cases, even cancer.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{effectiveness}} of various types of parental communication in modifying children’s responses to television food advertising. In a combined diary-survey study among 234 parents of 4 - to 12 -year-old children, I investigated how different styles of advertising mediation (active vs. restrictive) and consumer communication (concept-oriented vs. socio-oriented) moderated the relation between children’s advertising exposure and their consumption of advertised energy-dense food products. Interaction analysis in regression showed that active advertising mediation (i. e. explaining the purpose and nature of advertising), and sociooriented consumer communication (i. e. emphasizing control and restrictions) signiﬁcantly reduced the impact of advertising on children’s food consumption. Parental <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> advertising <b>exposure</b> were only effective among younger children (< 8).

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the mean RF power {{radiated}} by mobile telephones during voice calls in 3 G VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) using an application well known to mobile Internet users, and to compare it with the mean power radiated during voice calls in 3 G VoCS (Voice over Circuit Switch) on a traditional network. Knowing that the specific absorption rate (SAR) is proportional to the mean radiated power, the user's exposure could be clearly identified at the same time. Three 3 G (High Speed Packet Access) smartphones from three different manufacturers, all dual-band for GSM (900 MHz, 1800 MHz) and dual-band for UMTS (900 MHz, 1950 MHz), were used between 28 July and 04 August 2011 in Paris (France) to make 220 two-minute calls on a mobile telephone network with national coverage. The places where the calls were made were selected in such a way as to describe the whole range of usage situations of the mobile telephone. The measuring equipment, called “SYRPOM”, recorded the radiation power levels and the frequency bands used during the calls with a sampling rate of 20, 000 per second. In the framework of this study, the mean normalised power radiated by a telephone in 3 G VoIP calls was evaluated at 0. 75 % maximum power of the smartphone, compared with 0. 22 % in 3 G VoCS calls. The very low average power levels associated with use of 3 G devices with VoIP or VoCS support the view that RF exposure resulting from their use is far from exceeding the basic <b>restrictions</b> <b>of</b> current <b>exposure</b> limits in terms of SAR...|$|R

40|$|The new European {{chemicals}} legislation REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and <b>restriction</b> <b>of</b> Chemicals) {{requires the}} development <b>of</b> <b>Exposure</b> Scenarios describing the conditions and risk management measures {{needed for the}} safe use <b>of</b> chemicals. Such <b>Exposure</b> Scenarios should integrate considerations of both {{human health and the}} environment. Specific aspects are relevant for worker exposure. Gathering information on the uses of the chemical is an important step in developing an Exposure Scenario. In-house information at manufacturers is an important source. Downstream users can contribute information through direct contact or through their associations. Relatively simple approaches (Tier 1 tools, such as the ECETOC Targeted Risk Assessment and the model EASE) can be used to develop broad Exposure Scenarios that cover many use situations. These approaches rely on the categorisation of just a few determinants, including {{only a small number of}} risk management measures. Such approaches have a limited discriminatory power and are rather conservative. When the hazard of the substance or the complexity <b>of</b> the <b>exposure</b> situation require a more in-depth approach, further development <b>of</b> the <b>Exposure</b> Scenarios with Tier 2 approaches is needed. Measured data sets <b>of</b> worker <b>exposure</b> are very valuable in a Tier 2 approach. Some downstream user associations have attempted to build Exposure Scenarios based on measured data sets. Generic Tier 2 tools for developing Exposure Scenarios do not exist yet. To enable efficient development <b>of</b> the worker <b>exposure</b> part <b>of</b> <b>Exposure</b> Scenarios a further development of Tier 1 and Tier 2 tools is needed.
