50|$|International {{criticism}} of Israeli government policies is usually expressed within {{the discipline of}} international law, with accusations of failures to meet obligations as member of United Nations and other international organisations. Criticism of contemporary policies mostly relate to issues in the Palestinian territories rather than Israel itself, with Israeli settlements, treatment of Palestinian Arabs, the conduct of Israeli Defense Forces during conflicts and accusations of economic strangulation of the Gaza Strip. of Palestinian territories. Criticism of historic Israeli government policies relate to issues with ongoing consequences such as the refusal to allow post-war Palestinian refugees and their descendents {{to return to their}} homes, and the prolonged occupation of territories gained in war and the construction of settlements therein. Israel's status as a representative democracy has been questioned as Israeli residents of the occupied territories are allowed to vote in Israel’s elections while Palestinian residents are not. Another source of criticism is the friction generated by the conversion issue between Israel's orthodox rabbinate and non-orthodox segments of the Jewish diaspora. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to delegitimize Israel's right to exist. This has led to an ongoing debate <b>regarding</b> <b>at</b> what point {{criticism of}} Israel crosses the line to antisemitism.|$|E
5000|$|Alexandru Lele {{affirmed the}} then-Prime Minister Adrian Năstase was [...] "trampling {{criminal}} investigations under foot." [...] Several Romanian newspapers claimed that political interference {{at a high}} level was influencing seniors in the prosecution office to force Panait to make the investigation. Panait refused to submit to such demands and his superiors took the case away from him. Despite this, Panait wrote a non-indictment decision on his colleague and turned it into the office. His superiors then took away all his cases. Arguably, a large conspiracy surrounded Panait to demonstrate to him that he was schizophrenic and {{on the verge of a}} nervous breakdown. Nevertheless, Alexandru Lele stated that the Supreme Court of Justice had the Prosecutor General's Office should take into account [...] "the likelihood of prosecutor Cristian Panait's being killed". He affirmed: [...] "I am sure that political pressure was put on Panait <b>regarding</b> <b>at</b> least two of the cases he was in charge of - my case and that of deputy Gheorghiu, but I do not think investigators took into account this possibility". An article from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung talks about Victor Ponta’s involvement in the seemingly accidental death of Panait, who apparently suffered a lethal accident soon after meeting with Ponta.|$|E

50|$|The above {{hypothesis}} {{has recently}} been challenged by {{a new and more}} parsimonious hypothesis with regard to evolution. The two streams must work hand-in-hand while processing visual information. Neuroanatomical and function neuroimaging studies have proven multiple visual maps that exist in the posterior brain, <b>regarding</b> <b>at</b> least 40 distinct regions. A single part of the outside world controls visual processing, and then particular areas are recognized in which single cells react to specific stimuli, such as faces. This hypothesis, one that indicates a more network-like model, {{is becoming more and more}} accepted among researchers. The pathway model mentioned above now experiences many conflicts. It has been discovered experimentally that there is more than just one way to process actions. For example, three distinct processing routes could exist dorsally, one for grasping, another for reaching, and yet a third for awareness of personal actions. No longer can just one dorsal stream be accounted for with regard to processing vision for action. The previous hypothesis also states that there is a clear hierarchy in which processing of visual stimuli goes from least complex to most complex in a linear fashion. However, lesions at one end should therefore have the same effect on the opposite end, and this cannot be observed experimentally. This further proves the integration of the two streams and many visual processes operating in parallel, involving multiple ventral and dorsal streams in a patchwork-type model.|$|E

40|$|This small {{qualitative}} study, conducted {{through the}} University of Mauritius, examined healthcare professionals’ engagement with {{and willingness to}} recommend alternative therapies (AT) for adjunctive management of diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes. Fifteen (15) healthcare practitioners were selected to participate, completing a questionnaire regarding their opinions about the appropriateness of AT to support type 2 diabetes patients. The results highlight nutritionists’ and dieticians’ relative familiarity with AT, for personal use and with clinic patients. However, nurses and medical doctors were often sceptical, unwilling to discuss or recommend AT, and knew little about potential benefits. There appears an emerging need to improve training of Mauritian healthcare professionals <b>regarding</b> <b>AT,</b> to improve their ability to provide up-­to-­date clinical information to the many diabetic patients in the community who often use AT...|$|E
