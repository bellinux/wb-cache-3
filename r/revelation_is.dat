5|$|Myst IV: <b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Myst video game series, developed {{and published by}} Ubisoft. Revelation was the first game in the series released on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was not produced {{as it would have}} taken twelve compact discs to fit the data. Like , Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects for added realism.|$|E
5|$|Development of Revelation lasted {{more than}} three years; Ubisoft had as many as eighty {{employees}} working on the game. Musician Peter Gabriel lent his voice and a song to the game's audio; the original score was written by Exiles composer Jack Wall. Overall, reception to the game was positive; reviewers lauded the impressive visuals, sound, and puzzles. Publications such as Computer Gaming World took issue with the control scheme of the game. <b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> the last game in the Myst series to use both prerendered backgrounds and full-motion video; the final game in the series, , is rendered in real-time throughout.|$|E
5|$|<b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> {{the ninth}} studio album by American Christian rock band Third Day, {{released}} on July 29, 2008. The album {{was produced by}} Howard Benson, who had decided {{to work with the}} band after rock singer Chris Daughtry drew attention to lead singer Mac Powell's vocal ability. Although they were initially uncomfortable working with Benson, Third Day achieved a positive working relationship with Benson, who felt that their different religious beliefs made them challenge each other in a way reflected in the record.|$|E

5|$|The idea of Masonic brotherhood {{probably}} descends from a 16th-century {{legal definition}} of a brother as one who has taken an oath of mutual support to another. Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine <b>revelation</b> <b>is</b> appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition). In Progressive continental Freemasonry, books other than scripture are permissible, a cause of rupture between Grand Lodges.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular {{men and women who have}} been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This <b>revelation</b> <b>is</b> outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of doubt in herself. All three armies eventual convene at the base of the Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E

25|$|The Book of <b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> at {{the core}} of Christian eschatology. The study of <b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> usually divided into four interpretative methodologies or hermeneutics. In the Futurist approach, <b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> treated mostly as {{unfulfilled}} prophecy taking place in some yet undetermined future. This is the approach which most applies to eschatological studies. In the Preterist approach, <b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> chiefly interpreted as having prophetic fulfillment in the past, principally, the events of the first century CE, such as the struggle of Christianity to survive the persecutions of the Roman Empire, the fall of Jerusalem in 70 CE, and the desecration of the Temple in the same year. In the Historicist approach, Revelation provides a broad view of history, and passages in Revelation are identified with major historical people and events. In the Idealist (or Spiritualist or Symbolic) approach, the events of Revelation are neither past nor future, but are purely symbolic, dealing with the ongoing struggle and ultimate triumph of good over evil.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Aquinas first {{described}} in {{two types of}} revelation in Christianity as general revelation and special revelation. General revelation occurs through observation of the created order. Such observations can logically lead to important conclusions, such as the existence of God and some of God's attributes. General <b>revelation</b> <b>is</b> also an element of Christian apologetics. Certain specifics, such as the Trinity and the Incarnation, are revealed in the teachings in the Scriptures and can not otherwise be deduced except by special revelation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Revelation</b> <b>is</b> the {{revealing}} or disclosing, {{or making}} something obvious through active or passive communication with God, and can originate directly from God, or through an agent, {{such as an}} angel. One who has experienced such contact is often called a prophet. Christianity considers the Bible as divinely or supernaturally revealed or inspired. Such revelation does not always require the presence of God or an angel. For instance, in the concept called of interior locution by Roman Catholics, supernatural revelation can include just an inner voice heard by the recipient.|$|E

It has frequently been mentioned that the real reason Tamm left the show after one year, was that she was pregnant. This is untrue, as often stated by Tamm herself over the years. The <b>revelation</b> <b>is</b> a myth that was started by former producer John Nathan-Turner. Various sources, including some online sites, mention that the reason she couldn't film a regeneration sequence, was because she was pregnant.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>revelation</b> <b>was</b> {{not made}} public to the LDS Church {{as a whole}} until Brigham Young {{publicly}} acknowledged it in 1852.

[...] Published affidavits by eyewitnesses accusing church leaders of following the teaching and engaging in polygamy had resulted in Smith's murder by a mob in 1844. The <b>revelation</b> <b>was</b> codified in the LDS Church's canon as its Doctrine and Covenants section 132 in the 1870s.
