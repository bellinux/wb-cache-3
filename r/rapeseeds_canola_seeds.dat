The model was simpler in form than GENESYS, because several of the features used in GENESYS are not applicable to the Australian cropping environment. The model failed to adequately replicate the data from Rieger et al. (2002), largely because of a failure to accurately predict gene flow from fields past 50 m. Sensitivity analysis determined that <b>canola</b> <b>seed</b> bank decay parameters and the pollen dispersal curve were the main factors influencing {{the output of the}} model. The main factors of importance that need understanding are the shape of the pollen distribution curve, the persistence of <b>canola</b> <b>seed</b> in the soil, the ability of old <b>canola</b> <b>seed</b> to germinate and the amount of self-pollination among canola volunteer populations. In general, the model predicted low rates of gene flow from GM canola crops in the environment. The greatest risk of gene flow was for small non-GM canola fields adjacent to GM canola fields.
