5|$|Harta Berdarah starred Soelastri and Zonder, and {{featured}} Moesa, Oedjang, Oesman, Haroen, and Abdullah. Many {{of these}} actors, including Soelastri and Fatimah, had had roles in Kedok Ketawa, and Moesa, though only <b>recently</b> <b>signed,</b> had previously acted for another company. Zonder, {{who made his}} film debut in Harta Berdarah, was well-versed in the traditional martial art of silat, while Soelastri was {{also known as a}} keroncong singer under the stage name Miss Ning; both made use of these skills for the film, which was scored by Hugo Dumas' musical troupe Lief Java. Cinematography for the production was handled by KH Tjit.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>recently</b> <b>signed</b> {{a two-year}} {{extension}} to his BBC staff writer's contract, Nigel Kneale was specifically commissioned {{to write a}} sequel to The Quatermass Experiment in early 1955 to challenge the new ITV network. Kneale was inspired by contemporary fears over secret UK Ministry of Defence research establishments such as Porton Down, and also by being required, as a BBC staff member, to sign the Official Secrets Act. As with The Quatermass Experiment, Quatermass II was produced and directed by Rudolph Cartier; he and Kneale particularly enjoyed working together. Since the first Quatermass serial, {{the two men had}} collaborated on the literary adaptations Wuthering Heights (1953) and Nineteen Eighty-Four (1954), and on Kneale's abominable snowman play The Creature (1955).|$|E

5|$|Taylor's {{first season}} at Villa ended with {{automatic}} promotion as Second Division runners-up, being pipped {{to the title}} by Millwall. One player who contributed to that season's success was the <b>recently</b> <b>signed</b> David Platt, a former Manchester United reserve who had signed from Crewe Alexandra for £200,000 just after Taylor's arrival. Before he left in 1991, Platt scored 68 goals in his 155 appearances for the club. Villa avoided relegation {{on the last day}} of the 198889 season as other results favoured them. In the 198990 season they emerged as surprise contenders for the title, leading for three weeks in the latter stages of the season before finishing in second place, nine points behind Liverpool. Taylor departed for the England manager's job and was succeeded by Slovak coach Jozef Vengloš, the first foreign manager in the First Division.|$|E
5|$|Aidoo was {{designated}} as the backup running back out of training camp in 2005, with the Tiger-Cats electing to keep only the trio of Troy Davis, Aidoo, and fullback Julian Radlein on the roster as running backs. In August, Aidoo briefly stepped in for Davis after the latter suffered an injured hamstring. Through the first 11 regular season games, Aidoo made two special teams tackles and rushed for 51 yards on six carries. This led The Hamilton Spectator to speculate he would be dropped from the active roster in favor of <b>recently</b> <b>signed</b> running back Jesse Lumsden. After Troy {{was traded to the}} Eskimos, this never came to pass, and Aidoo started as a fullback for the last few games of the season. The Tiger-Cats did not make the playoffs. Aidoo finished the season with five special teams tackles and 116 rushing yards from 18 carries.|$|E
5|$|Ross {{took over}} an {{improved}} team. He had <b>recently</b> <b>signed</b> three players, Milt Schmidt, Bobby Bauer and Woody Dumart, who all {{grew up together}} in Kitchener, Ontario, and had them play on the same line, soon nicknamed the Kraut Line {{in reference to the}} German heritage of all three. Along with them, Ross had acquired a new goaltender in 1938, Frank Brimsek; after Brimsek earned six shutouts in his first eight games, the Bruins traded away Tiny Thompson to allow Brimsek to play. With these players the Bruins finished first in the league in 1937–38; Ross was named as the second best coach in the league, selected for the end of season All-Star Second Team. The next season the Bruins won 36 of 48 games, and won the Stanley Cup in the playoffs; Ross was named to the First All-Star Team as the best coach in the league for the season and the team only tied two games, which is tied for the second fewest in a season. He hired the recently retired Cooney Weiland to coach the Bruins for the 1939–40 NHL season. The Bruins would win the Cup again in 1941, and tied their record of only four away losses all season. Ross once again took over as coach of the team before the 1941–42 season began, as Weiland became coach of the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League, and led the team to 25 wins in 48 games, which was enough to earn third place in the league. By this time the Second World War had caused several Bruins players, including the entire Kraut Line and goaltender Brimsek, to enlist in their respective armed forces. The Bruins finished second in the NHL during the 1942–43 season with 24 wins in 50 games and Ross was again named in the Second NHL All-Star Team as second best coach in the league. The Bruins missed the playoffs in 1943–44, the first time in ten years they failed to qualify, but returned to the playoffs the next season, something they did for five straight years.|$|E
