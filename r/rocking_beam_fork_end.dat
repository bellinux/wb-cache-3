5000|$|Some {{rear track}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> have {{threaded}} devices ("chaintugs") {{to aid in}} setting the proper chain tension. These may be integral to the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> or separate items. They work by holding the rear axle in an eye {{at the end of}} a threaded bolt. The bolt passes through a cap which fits over the open <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Tightening the bolts on each side causes the axle to be pulled backwards towards the open <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> tensing the chain. Chaintugs can also solve the problem of [...] "axle creep" [...] on hard-ridden fixed-gear bicycles, especially those with hard chromed <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> which may not offer adequate grip for the serrated track nuts.|$|R
25|$|The rear {{triangle}} {{connects to}} the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> where the rear wheel is attached. It consists of the seat tube and paired chain stays and seat stays. The chain stays run connecting the bottom bracket to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> The seat stays connect {{the top of the}} seat tube (often at or near the same point as the top tube) to the rear <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> [...] fork-end, or forkend is a slot in {{a bicycle}} frame or bicycle fork where the axle of a bicycle wheel is attached. A dropout {{is a type}} of <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> that allows the rear wheel to be removed without first derailing the chain.|$|R

50|$|Track bicycle frames have track <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> {{on which}} the opening faces rearwards. Because {{they do not have}} dropouts, the chain must be derailed from the {{sprocket}} before the rear wheel can be removed from a typical track bike. Some single-speed bicycles intended for street or trail use are also equipped with track <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> instead of dropouts.|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} failure in a Turn buckle is investigated. It {{was found that}} the {{fracture}} had occured at the rivet hole close to the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> Electron microscope study of the fracture surface showed that the <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> of the turn buckle had failed by a fatigue initiated fracture and that the fatigue could have originated due to excessive clearance in this region...|$|R
60|$|The real {{object of}} these {{preliminary}} feats, however performed, is, probably, to inspire faith, which Dr. Charcot {{might have done}} by swallowing a cradle. The Indians explain that the barrel staves apparently swallowed are merely dematerialised by 'spirits,' leaving only the <b>forked</b> <b>end</b> {{sticking out of the}} conjurer's mouth. In fact, Hearne caught the conjurer in the act of making a separate <b>forked</b> <b>end.</b>|$|R
50|$|The large, rugged antlers are {{typically}} rusine, the brow tines being simple and the <b>beams</b> <b>forked</b> at the tip, {{so that they}} have only three tines. The antlers {{are typically}} up to 110 cm long in fully adult individuals. As with most deer, only the males have antlers.|$|R

50|$|Bicycle forks {{usually have}} an offset, or rake (not to be {{confused}} with a different use of the word rake in the motorcycle world), that places the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or by placing the <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.|$|R
50|$|The {{source is}} near Penkun, {{from which the}} river flows both to the North and to the South. The {{southern}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> with its confluence to the Welse river, the northern <b>fork</b> <b>ends</b> with the confluence with the Uecker only a few kilometers before reaching the Oder Lagoon. The swampy Randow valley is known as Randowbruch, the historical crossing of the Randowbruch swamps are at its narrowest point in LÃ¶cknitz. The river lent {{its name to the}} former district of Uecker-Randow in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, also to the historical Landkreis Randow of the Province of Pomerania.|$|R
50|$|In general, {{a modern}} bicycle frame {{intended}} for derailleur gears {{will have a}} vertical dropout, while one designed for singlespeed or hub gears will have horizontal dropouts or track <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R
50|$|Forks {{have been}} made from steel, {{aluminum}}, carbon fiber, titanium, magnesium, and various combinations. For example, a fork may have carbon fiber blades with an aluminum crown, steer tube, or <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b>|$|R

30|$|Theories of {{a natural}} {{equilibrium}} arch, pressure arch, cantilever beam, prefabricated fissures, articulated <b>rock,</b> elastic foundation <b>beam,</b> and many other well-known hypotheses have been proposed. In China, the masonry-beam structure model, passing-stress <b>rock</b> <b>beam</b> structure model, and key-layer theory have been proposed (Qian and Liu 1984; Song 1988; Qian and Shi 2003).|$|R

50|$|Forks {{may have}} {{attachment}} points for brakes, racks, and fenders. These may {{be located in}} the crown, along the blades, and near the <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> These are often holes, threaded or not, and may be located on tabs that protrude.|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven {{the first}} time for shallow thinner seam mining, this paper resorted to methods of field {{measurement}} and numerical simulation to research overlying strata movement law during shallow thinner seam mining. Through research, it was obtained that 20 m in front of coal wall was the region influenced by mining. In this region, advanced abutment pressure demonstrated law of single elastic. The pressure reached its peak value at coal wall and the fracture of <b>rock</b> <b>beam</b> occurred only in coal wall. When <b>rock</b> <b>beam</b> ruptured, there was no obviously deformation and other pressure behavior in roadway. As distance to coal wall increasing, pressure value was decreasing in rule of negative exponential...|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the dangers}} {{inherent}} in slingshots is the high probability that the bands will fail. Most bands are made from latex, which degrades with time and use, causing the bands to eventually fail under load. [...] Failures at the pouch end are safest, as they result in the band rebounding away from the user. Failures at the <b>fork</b> <b>end,</b> however, send the band back towards the shooter's face, which can cause eye and facial injuries. [...] One method to minimize {{the chance of a}} <b>fork</b> <b>end</b> failure is to utilize a tapered band, thinner at the pouch end, and thicker and stronger at the <b>fork</b> <b>end.</b> [...] Designs that use loose parts at the fork are the most dangerous, as they can result in those parts being propelled back towards the shooter's face, such as the ball attachment used in the recalled Daisy [...] "Natural" [...] line of slingshots (see image). The band could slip out of the slot in which it rested, and the hard ball in the tube resulted in cases of blindness and broken teeth. Daisy models using plain tubular bands were not covered in the recall, because the elastic tubing does not cause severe injuries upon failure.|$|R
50|$|The {{width of}} the fork, also called spacing, is {{measured}} colinear with the front wheel axle between the inside edges of the two <b>fork</b> <b>ends.</b> Most modern adult sized forks have 100 mm spacing. Downhill mountain bike forks designed for through axles have 110 mm spacing.|$|R
50|$|This trail {{begins at}} Amram's Pillars and leads up Mount Amir, where it forks in two toward either the Israel National Trail {{or through a}} canyon with copper mines. Both <b>forks</b> <b>end</b> near Black Canyon. The trail does not loop, and takes {{approximately}} 4 hours to complete.|$|R
500|$|At {{full power}} the wheel uses 2tons (2tonnes) {{of water per}} second and rotates five times a minute. The water wheel drives a {{flexible}} coupling to a pit wheel with a diameter of , which has 408 hand-fitted wooden teeth that mesh with a [...] cast iron gear, increasing the speed to 16 rpm. From there, cranks drive vertical connecting rods that transfer the energy to two [...] long cast iron <b>rocking</b> <b>beams</b> made by Boulton and Watt. Each <b>rocking</b> <b>beam</b> drives an [...] diameter lift pump, which also takes its supply from the mill leat. Each pump stroke raises 50imperial gallons (230litres) of water to the canal via [...] of [...] diameter cast iron pipe.|$|R
25|$|Track frames {{have much}} in common with road and time trial frames, but come with rear-facing, {{horizontal}} <b>fork</b> <b>ends,</b> rather than dropouts, to allow one to adjust the position of the rear wheel horizontally to set the proper chain tension. Also the seat tube angle is steeper than on road racing bikes.|$|R
