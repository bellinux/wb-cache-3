The computer interprets the supplied traffic classification table (Federal Highway Administration Scheme F, or user supplied) and composes the axle events {{caused by the}} parallel beam breaks into a classified vehicle. The classification data is stored in the unit and can optionally can be streamed in real-time via a serial or an Ethernet connection. The <b>raw</b> <b>beam</b> event information can also be saved to the unit for verification purposes. The data is output as plain text. Thus, it can be translated to many common file formats used in traffic data collection.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{blood flow}} {{velocity}} measurement using ultrasound {{is capable of}} resolving the axial component (i. e., that aligned with the ultrasound propagation direction) of the blood flow velocity vector. However, these Doppler-based methods are incapable of detecting blood flow in the direction normal to the ultrasound beam. In addition, these methods require repeated pulse-echo interrogation at the same spatial location. In this paper, we introduce a method which estimates the lateral component of blood flow within a single image frame using the observation that the speckle pattern corresponding to the blood reflectors (typically red blood cells) stretches (i. e., is “smeared”) if the blood {{is moving in the}} same direction as the electronically-controlled transducer line selection in a 2 D image. The situation is analogous to the observed elongation of a subject photographed with a moving camera. Here, we develop a relationship between speckle size, scan speed, and blood flow velocity. Experiments were performed with a blood flow phantom and high-frequency transducer of a commercially available ultrasound machine. Data was captured through an interface allowing access to the <b>raw</b> <b>beam</b> formed data. Blood flow with velocities ranging from 15 to 40 cm/s were investigated in this paper. Results show that there is a linear relationship between the reciprocal of the stretch factor and blood flow velocity. Two scan speeds were used in our experiments. When the scan velocity is 64. 8 cm/s, compared with the theoretical model, fitting results based on experimental data gave us a linear relationship with average flow estimation error of 1. 74 ± 1. 48 cm/s. When the scan velocity is 37. 4 cm/s, the average estimation error is 0. 65 ± 0. 45 cm/s...|$|E

40|$|In {{airborne}} laser bathymetry {{knowledge of}} exact water level heights is {{a precondition for}} applying run-time and refraction correction of the <b>raw</b> laser <b>beam</b> travel path in the medium water. However, due to specular reflection especially at very smooth water surfaces often no echoes from the water surface itself are recorded (drop outs). In this paper, we first discuss the feasibility of reconstructing the water surface from redundant observations of the water bottom in theory. Furthermore, we provide a first practical approach for solving this problem, suitable for static and locally planar water surfaces. It minimizes the bottom surface deviations of point clouds from individual flight strips after refraction correction. Both theoretical estimations and practical results confirm {{the potential of the}} presented method to reconstruct water level heights in dm precision. Achieving good results requires enough morphological details in the scene and that the water bottom topography is captured from different directions...|$|R
40|$|Industrial {{production}} of low temperature p-Si back plates for LCDs by high power excimer laser annealing was introduced several years ago. Regarding {{the economy of}} the process, one of the major advantages of excimer laser annealing is the opportunity to make use of low cost glass substrates due to the low temperature of the annealing process. The Lambda Physik high power excimer laser series are operated with the MicroLas 370 mm line beam optics, integrated by Japan Steel Works into industrial systems. The MicroLas line beam optics for conventional excimer laser annealing (ELA) process converts the <b>raw</b> laser <b>beam</b> profile into a stable and homogeneous rectangular illumination field with high aspect ratio. The excimer laser light source, the LAMBDA STEEL 1000, delivers stabilized pulse energies up to 1 Joule at repetition rates up to 300 Hz. The crystallization using excimer lasers allows to produce films with electron mobility of 100 - 150 cm/Vsec with the Line beam technique. The new SLS-method, which is currently under industrial investigation, even allows to obtain electron mobility between 200 - 400 cm/Vsec...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} implementation of an extremely scalable real-time RFI mitigation method, based on the offline AOFlagger. All algorithms scale linearly {{in the number of}} samples. We describe how we implemented the flagger in the LOFAR real-time pipeline, on both CPUs and GPUs. Additionally, we introduce a novel simple history-based flagger that helps reduce the impact of our small window on the data. By examining an observation of a known pulsar, we demonstrate that our flagger can achieve much higher quality than a simple thresholder, even when running in real time, on a distributed system. The flagger works on visibility data, but also on <b>raw</b> voltages, and <b>beam</b> formed data. The algorithms are scale-invariant, and work on microsecond to second time scales. We are currently implementing a prototype for the time domain pipeline of the SKA central signal processor.

40|$|The {{coverage}} {{with two}} species of Zostera, Z. marina L. and Z. noltii (Hornem.) in the river Asón estuary near Santoña, Cantabria/Spain has been assessed between August and October 2000, using a BioSonics DT 6000 208 kHz split beam digital echosounder in combination with a DGPS receiver and a reference station. A surface of roughly 4 sqkm has been covered with transects spaced 20 m on average, {{resulting in a total}} track length of about 250 km, taking some 800, 000 samples (pings). A pre-release version of a specific software, based on SAVEWS (Submersed Aquatic Vegetation Early Warning System), developed by Bruce Sabol, USACE Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, and currently under further development through BioSonics, Inc., Seattle, was deployed in order to process the split <b>beam</b> <b>raw</b> data (only single beam data is read by the program).

40|$|One of {{the major}} {{uncertainties}} in ion beam therapy planning is the calculation of ion ranges in the patient’s tissue from CT images. The presence of non-tissue-equivalent mate- rials and materials with high photon attenuation like metals may aggravate this problem. Dual Energy Computed Tomography (DECT) allows to compute the electron density and effective atomic number. It could already be shown that this additional material information enables a more precise calculation of ion ranges. This thesis investigates the feasibility of the DECT approach {{for a range of}} metals from aluminum (Z = 13) up to tungsten (Z = 74). DECT scans of the samples reconstructed with a 16 bit CT scale and <b>raw</b> data based <b>beam</b> hardening correction were analyzed. The electron density and effective atomic number of aluminum and titanium (Z = 22) could be determined within the range of a few percent. These quantities could not be determined for samples with Z ≥ 22, but the samples were distinguishable from each other by their different CT numbers up to molybdenum (Z = 42). The precision of the determined ion ranges could be improved for aluminum from - 11. 46...|$|R
40|$|Due to its technology-related {{advantages}} {{the laser}} {{has maintained a}} highly flexible tool in industrial manufacturing. A large number of applications in laser material processing requires the generation of process adapted intensity distributions in the interaction zone, thus a tailored energy coupling for a particular machining process {{as well as the}} working geometry is facilitated. This functionality is provided by active or adaptive optical systems that transform the <b>raw</b> laser <b>beam</b> emitted from the laser source using spatially and temporally-varying beam shaping properties. The realization of such beam shaping systems is provided using two system technologies concerning those current drawbacks are identified. Opto-kinematic multibody systems base upon the reorientation of static optical components along defined motion paths. For the wavelength independent homogenization of laser beams mirror-based systems offer insufficient automation ability for the continuous scaling of the intensity distribution. However, the more suitable concepts basing on transmission only have limited use for the utilization of long-wave laser radiation. This drawback of opto-kinematic multibody systems is addressed by {{the development of a new}} concept for wavelength-independent, scalable laser beam homogenization. The scanner-based 3 D laser material processing is subject to field-variant projection influences that cause a deformation of the intensity distribution in the interaction zone. The deformation emerges due to the non-perpendicular incidence of the laser beam on the working surface. Depending on the sensitivity of the machining process, the currently pursued strategy of the increase of the laser power will not lead to sufficient compensation. This drawback is counteracted in this work with the development of an adaptive beam shaping system. A significant increase in the spatial and temporal modulation capability is achieved by opto-electromechanical manipulation through the use of highly integrated components. Due to the relatively low cost and high efficiency, in particular commercially available, electrostatic membrane mirrors have become more important in the field of active laser beam shaping. The standardized functionality of commercial optical development environments do not take into account the characteristics of opto-electromechanical manipulation. Therefore, during the optical design no holistic optimization and evaluation of beam shaping properties can be carried out. This drawback is counteracted with the development of an integrated development methodology...|$|R
