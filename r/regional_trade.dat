5|$|Early on in {{the gold}} rush, the US Army sent a small {{detachment}} to Circle City, in case intervention was required in the Klondike, while the Canadian government considered excluding all American prospectors from the Yukon Territory. Neither eventuality took place and instead the US agreed to make Dyea a sub-port of entry for Canadians, allowing British ships to land Canadian passengers and goods freely there, while Canada agreed to permit American miners {{to operate in the}} Klondike. Both decisions were unpopular among their domestic publics: American businessmen complained that their right to a monopoly on <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> was being undermined, while the Canadian public demanded action against the American miners.|$|E

5|$|In 1678 the Manche Ch'ol {{population}} was devastated by disease; {{in the area}} around the town of San Lucas Tzalac it killed every child under six years old and almost all of those under the age of ten. Total deaths, including adults, numbered over 400 and the epidemic prompted all the Manche Ch'ol in the affected region to abandon the mission towns and flee into the forest. The Spanish made a number of further attempts to pacify the Manche Ch'ol, but these were ultimately unsuccessful, and the Manche Ch'ol rebelled in 1689. In that year many Manche Ch'ol were forcibly relocated to the Urrán Valley in the highlands, resulting in the abandonment of many of the Manche orchards; this eventually led to the collapse of the <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> network that by then had been fully linked with colonial Guatemala and supplied it with unknown quantities of cacao.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Maya merchants, {{although}} they are depicted on Maya ceramics in elaborate noble dress. From this, {{it is known that}} at least some traders were members of the elite. During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions. The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite. The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks. When merchants travelled, they painted themselves black, like their patron gods, and went heavily armed.|$|E
5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{integrated}} into a <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> network that included their Itza and Lakandon Ch'ol neighbours, and involved the exchange of Manche produce such as cacao, annatto and vanilla for salt, the only Maya source of which was controlled by the Itza after the Spanish conquest of the province of Acalan. This trade monopoly was maintained by force {{on the part of}} the Itza, who vigorously ensured that the Manche Ch'ol remained subservient to them. After the Manche towns on the coast of Belize fell under Spanish control in the 16th century, they continued to have close links with the independent inland Manche settlements. Trade continued and intermarriage was common. The towns in the Cancuén River drainage traded via land and riverine routes with both the independent Itza (notably with Nojpetén) and with colonial Verapaz (principally with Cobán and Cahabón).|$|E

40|$|<b>Regional</b> <b>trading</b> {{agreements}} are treaties entered into by states. States enter into <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> agreements {{for different reasons}} {{some of which are}} economic, political and security reasons. <b>Regional</b> <b>trading</b> agreements (herein after RTAs) have been successful in achieving trade liberalization at a much faster speed than the World Trade Organization (herein after WTO). The most notable example of RTAs is the European Communities that has been successful to liberalize both trade in goods and services. Members of those <b>Regional</b> <b>Trading</b> Agreements create rules of origin. Rules of origin are important in allocating the appropriate duty for imported goods. They tell the customs officer where those goods come from. If they come from a country which has a trading agreement with the importing state then the product will receive preferential treatment. The problem at the moment is that there are over four hundred <b>Regional</b> <b>Trading</b> Agreements in the world today. This proliferation of <b>Regional</b> <b>Trading</b> Agreements resulted into a lot of crisscrossing and very complicated rule of origin. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze the different possible solutions for the proliferation of <b>Regional</b> <b>Trading</b> Agreements and to propose the most realistic solution to the problem. To perform this task the paper will be divided into three parts. The paper relied both on direct and indirect research methodologies to answer the questions posed by the research paper. The first part deals with the legal and historical background of RTAs. It answers question of why states enter into RTAs and what is the legal basis for the formation of RTAs. The second part deals with proliferation of RTAs. It answers question like are RTAs stumbling blocks or building blocks to the multilateral trading system. It also describes the causes of proliferation of RTAs and the possible solutions. The third part deals with the conclusions and recommendations. It tells the reader the overall conclusion of the paper and the best solution proposed...|$|R

Missoula has an immediate trade area of approximately 180,000 residents. The Missoula is the hub of its Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) Economic Area, which includes the Montana Counties of Flathead, Lake, Lincoln, Mineral, Missoula, Ravalli, and Sanders. , the BEA listed the economic area population at 306,050. Key businesses sectors serving the area include health care, retail shopping, transportation, financial services, government and social services, education, events, arts and culture. Health care in particular is one of Missoula's fastest growing industries with St. Patrick Hospital (western Montana's only LevelII Trauma center) and the Community Medical Center already the city's second and third largest employers behind the university. 55% of employment in Missoula {{is made up of}} the service and retail sectors. Export industries are concentrated in heavy and civil engineering, construction, beverage production, technical services, truck transportation, and forestry-, logging-, and wood-related industries. In addition to nearly 4million out-of-state visitors annually, which makes tourism a significant aspect of the Missoula economy, Missoula also is home to a vibrant sector of alternative healthcare.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of the 19thcentury {{industrialisation}} came into full effect and a number of new industries emerged around production and refinement of agricultural products, especially oil and butter. Many companies from this time would come to leave permanent iconic marks on Aarhus. The Ceres Brewery was established in 1856 and served as Aarhus' local brewery for more than 150 years, gradually expanding into an industrial district known as Ceres-grunden (lit.: the Ceres-grounds). In 1896 local farmers and businessmen created Korn- og Foderstof Kompagniet (KFK), focused on grain and feedstuffs. KFK established departments all over the country, while its headquarters remained in Aarhus where its large grain silos still stand today. Otto Mønsted created the Danish Preserved Butter Company in 1874, focusing on butter export to England, China and Africa and later founded the Aarhus Butterine Company in 1883, the first Danish margarine factory. The industry became an important employer, with factory employees increasing from 100 in 1896 to 1,000 in 1931, effectively transforming the city from a <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> hub into an industrial centre. Other new factories of note included the dockyard Aarhus Flydedok, the oil mill Århus Oliefabrik and the ironworks Frichs.|$|E
5|$|The city of Kaunas {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of two rivers, the Neman and Neris, which link Lithuania's interior and its capital, Vilnius, to the Baltic Sea. The Baltic peoples had created significant domains by the 1st century, and came into conflict with the Scandinavians and the Slavs; the Teutonic Order began targeting Lithuanian lands {{at the beginning of the}} 13th century. Since Lithuania was heavily wooded and its lands were often impassable, its interior was most approachable along its rivers when frozen and during the short dry harvest season in late summer. In response to this vulnerability, defensive structures, including a brick castle in Kaunas, were in place at various points on the Nemunas River by the 14th century. The city was first mentioned in written sources in 1361; it received Magdeburg rights, regulating its autonomy and establishing trade protocols, from Vytautas the Great in 1408. An outpost of the Hanseatic League was created there in 1441. By the end of the 16th century Kaunas had become a major <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> center, but plagues, fires, and wars adversely affected the country and city during the 17th and 18th centuries. Following the partitions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth at the end of the 18th century, Lithuania was incorporated into the Russian Empire. Two major 19th century projects contributed to the city's revival. The Augustów Canal, completed in 1832, linked the Neman to the Black Sea, and a rail line linking Saint Petersburg, Warsaw, and Germany via Kaunas was completed in 1862; it was part of a limited network of western Russian railways.|$|E

5|$|Water-borne {{trade has}} been practiced {{since at least}} the dawn of civilization, when Sumeria was {{connected}} to Harappan India. Around 2000 BC, the Minoans of Crete established the earliest thalassocracy, a maritime empire heavily dependent upon its trade and naval power. The city-states of the Phoenicians and Greeks then replaced them in the centuries after 1200 BC, ultimately establishing far-flung colonial empires which spread from the Sea of Azov to the Atlantic coast of Morocco. Under the Romans, commerce continued to thrive. In the first centuries BC, steppe nomads' interruption of India's access to Siberian gold caused them to open up maritime routes to Malaysia and Indonesia, exposing them first to Hindu and then Muslim traders. With the collapse of the Roman Empire, European trade dwindled but it continued to flourish elsewhere. The Tamil Chola dynasty thrived on trade between Tang China, the Javanese Srivijaya Empire, and the Abbasid Caliphate in the west. Following further conquests, Arabians came to dominate maritime trade in the Indian Ocean, spreading Islam along the East African coast and, eventually, Southeast Asia. A major effect of the Age of Discovery was the unification of the world's <b>regional</b> <b>trade</b> networks into a single world market, largely run by and for the European monarchs and the merchants of Amsterdam, London, and other Atlantic ports. From the 16th to the 19th centuries, about 13 million people were shipped across the Atlantic to be sold as slaves in the Americas. The Hales Trophy was an award for the fastest commercial crossing of the Atlantic and was won by the SS United States in 1952 for a crossing that took three days, ten hours, and forty minutes.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the ongoing}} {{worldwide}} trend toward regional integration, Japan has remained outside of all <b>regional</b> <b>trading</b> agreements. Because more than 60 percent of Japan’s trade is with {{countries that are}} members of a major regional bloc, this reluctance may have had significant effects on its pattern and volume of trade. Indeed, I find that Japan’s exports have been reduced by the integration of its trading partners, and that this effect has been fairly uniform across integration regimes.
