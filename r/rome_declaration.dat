He befriends peoples disillusioned by Rome and outwits the opponents who believe the land route he has chosen is impossible. Hannibal’s troops suffer brutal losses as they pass through the Pyrenees Mountains, ford the Rhone River, and make a winter crossing of the Alps, before descending to fight battles at the Trebia River, Lake Trasimene, Cannae and Zama.

5000|$|Unlike other reform movements, the English Reformation {{began by}} royal influence. Henry VIII {{considered}} himself a thoroughly Catholic King, and in 1521 he defended the papacy against Luther {{in a book}} he commissioned entitled, The Defence of the Seven Sacraments, for which Pope Leo X awarded him the title Fidei Defensor (Defender of the Faith). However, the king came into conflict with the papacy when he wished to annul his marriage with Catherine of Aragon, for which he needed papal sanction. Catherine, among many other noble relations, was the aunt of Emperor Charles V, the papacy's most significant secular supporter. The ensuing dispute eventually lead to a break from <b>Rome</b> and the <b>declaration</b> of the King of England {{as head of the}} English Church. England would later experience periods of frenetic and eclectic reforms contrasted by periods led by staunch conservatives. Monarchs such as Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, and Archbishops of Canterbury such as Thomas Cranmer and William Laud pushed the Church of England in many directions over the course of only a few generations. What emerged was a state church that considered itself both [...] "Reformed" [...] and [...] "Catholic" [...] but not [...] "Roman" [...] (and hesitated from the title [...] "Protestant"), and other [...] "unofficial" [...] more radical movements such as the Puritans.|$|R
50|$|In 1626 Jesuit and Capuchin missionaries {{began to}} proselytize among the Syriac Orthodox {{faithful}} at Aleppo, forming a larger pro-catholic movement within the Syriac Orthodox Church. So in 1667, when the Syriac Orthodox Patriarchate had fallen vacant, the Catholic party {{was able to}} elect one of its own, Andrew Akijan as Patriarch of the Syriac Church. This provoked a split in the community, and after Akijan’s death in 1677 two opposing patriarchs were elected, with the Pro-Catholic one being the uncle of Andrew Akijan. However, when the Catholic Patriarch died in 1702, this very brief line of Catholic Patriarchs upon the Syriac Church's See of Antioch died out with him. After {{the death of the}} Akijan line, The Ottoman government supported the Syriac Orthodoxy's agitation against the Syriac Catholics, and throughout the 18th century the Syriac Catholics underwent suffering and much persecution. Due to this there were long periods when no Syriac Catholic bishops were functioning, so a Patriarch could not be elected, and the community was forced to go entirely underground. However, in 1782, the Syriac Orthodox Holy Synod elected Metropolitan Michael Jarweh of Aleppo as Patriarch. Shortly after he was enthroned, he declared himself Catholic and in unity with the Pope of <b>Rome.</b> After this <b>declaration</b> Jarweh took refuge in Lebanon and built the still-extant monastery of Our Lady at Sharfeh, and by that act became the Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church. Since Jarweh there has been an unbroken succession of Syriac Catholic Patriarchs, which is known as the Ignatius Line.|$|R

5000|$|The term food {{security}} {{was first used}} in the 1960-1970s to refer to food supply and consistent access to food in international development work. [...] In 1966 the treaty titled the United Nations International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights was created to ensure economic, social and cultural rights including the “inalienable right to adequate nutritious food”. [...] In 1974 the World Food Conference focused on producing enough food for the world, ensuring the supply was reliable, and reducing dramatic price fluctuations. [...] Even early on {{it was clear that}} there was a great discrepancy between the world’s food supply and people’s access to food. Advances in agricultural technology in non-industrialized countries resulting in production of more food did not necessarily result in improved food access as evidenced by the Green Revolution. Rather, many environmental problems such as insecticide resistant pests, soil erosion, and pesticide poisoning of both people and wildlife resulted. During the 1980s and 1990s {{food security}} became recognized as a major public health concern in industrialized countries. [...] The concept of food entitlement was introduced in 1981 along with a shift in focus to ensured food access with adequate supply at the individual or household level in industrialized nations. [...] Food security was measured directly by anthropometric means or by food intake assessment, and indirectly by indicators of poverty, comparison of wages to food costs, employment rates and the use of emergency food programs. [...] At the 1996 World Food Summit, the <b>Rome</b> <b>Declaration</b> on World Food Security reaffirmed, “the right of everyone to have access to safe and nutritious food, consistent with the right to adequate food and the fundamental right of everyone to be free from hunger”. [...] Throughout the 1980s and 1990s most responses to food insecurity tended to occur at the community level. [...] Community level initiatives allowed for more long lasting solutions to food issues as they were designed to empower individuals and increase knowledge and skills as opposed to providing only a temporary solution to food access. These efforts contributed largely to the evolution of the concept of CFS in the 1990s when environmental concerns were gaining recognition. [...] The emerging concept of CFS captured the central idea that addressing food security at the community level would allow more interested parties to become involved in the decision-making and planning process as well as enable a larger range of issues to be addressed such as environmentally sustainable food production, fair wages for local producers, and more sustainable food assistance programs.|$|E

Many publications {{in the field of}} geography education and a lot of papers presented at geography conferences focus on the problematic position of geography in primary and secondary education.

This article reviews ICN 2, its process, outputs and some of the gaps and weaknesses of the documents. ICN 2 's legacy can be interpreted in two ways-a missed opportunity or one of broad aspirations which have yet to translate into meaningful action. The paper considers whether ICN 2 could have adopted a more ecological approach to diet and nutrition, linking health and sustainability. While this fits the evidence, it would require a strong commitment to coherence and food system change, almost certainly a firm stance on some food corporate power, and resolve to champion health at the heart of economic policy. This ambitious agenda would require specific multi-actor and multi-level action, together with metrics and mechanisms for accountability. Coherent government policies and actions to tackle all manifestations of inappropriate diet, and to reframe the economic forces which shape such diets are urgently required. To achieve this, the public health movement needs to work closely with civil society, yet ICN 2 showed that there is some reluctance to energise that combination. As a result, ICN 2 must be judged a missed opportunity, despite having useful aspirations...|$|E

Given the dimension of the current global food crisis, food security means adopting effective and specific actions at individual, household, national, regional and global levels. Food security invites us to reflect upon ethical principles like human equity, justice between current and future generations, respect for human dignity and sustainable food production. We strive to maintain our basic ethical convictions and engage in societal debates about other important values. While we do this, we may have to change our ways of life and learn to create new priorities in the face of global responsibility. Science and technology are key tools to reach the Millennium Goals, providing both society and decision makers alike with relevant information and new options within an ethical framework.
