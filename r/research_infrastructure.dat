25|$|The new {{budgeting}} scheme {{described above}} is mainly {{concerned with the}} human and <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> in universities. Most of the physical development (e.g. buildings) and scientific infrastructure (e.g. laboratories and expensive equipment) of universities comes from philanthropic donations, primarily from the American Jewish community (CHE, 2014). This latter source of funding has greatly compensated {{for the lack of}} sufficient government funding for universities up until now but it is expected to diminish significantly in the years to come. Unless the government invests more in <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure,</b> Israel’s universities will be ill-equipped and insufficiently funded {{to meet the challenges of}} the 21st century.|$|E
25|$|The Israeli Centres of Research Excellence (I-CORE) programme, {{which dates}} from 2011, envisions the {{establishment}} of cross-institutional clusters of top researchers in specific fields and returning young Israeli scientists from abroad, with each centre being endowed with state-of-the-art <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure.</b> The Sixth Higher Education Plan invests NIS 300 million over six years in upgrading and renovating academic infrastructure and research facilities.|$|E
25|$|While high {{performing}} Asian {{economies and}} the six oldest ASEAN members have invested heavily in public education at the primary and secondary levels, tertiary education has been left largely to the private sector. Tertiary education in Southeast Asia is, in general, relatively weak in terms of technological capacity and integration such as in credit transfer schemes. Singapore is highly focused on innovation {{while the rest of}} the region lags behind. In most cases, universities are focused on teaching and service to government rather than academic research. Universities in Southeast Asia, both in terms of academic salaries and <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> (libraries, laboratories), tend to be poorly supported financially. Moreover, regional academic journals cater to their local audiences and respond less to international standards which makes universal or regional benchmarking difficult.|$|E

[...] In 1947, the Dominion Wildlife Service (Later known as Canadian Wildlife Service or CWS) was created to centralize wildlife <b>research</b> <b>infrastructure</b> within the federal government. [...] The manipulation of the bison was justified by Canadian Wildlife Service biologist William Fuller in a study that demonstrated that the tuberculosis found among the hybridized bison in the north helped maintain stable numbers in the park.

The project currently focuses on reptile reproduction, egg incubation, and temperature-dependent sex determination.
