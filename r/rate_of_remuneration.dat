5000|$|In {{regards to}} workmen’s compensation, various {{measures}} were introduced by Morrison to improve provisions for injured workers, meeting the requests {{of the miners}} {{for the inclusion of}} pneumoconiosis and the cotton trade unions for the inclusion of byssinosis within the scope of the Compensation Acts. A long-standing issue was the case of long-standing injury in which a man was compensated under the old Acts, and at a very different standard of wages than had ruled in his industry since. Morrison tackled this problem by carrying an Act through Parliament in 1943 that helped such cases “by providing that pre-accident earnings were to be reviewed, if and when a change occurs, after the date of the accident, in the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> in the class of employment in which the injured man had been employed.” This applied dating as far back as 1924, and many long standing cases had thus derived “substantial benefits resulting from war-time increases the rates of pay of their trade.” By this means, partial disability cases were significantly safeguarded from a reduction in compensation when rises in wage rates were given in their pre-injury employment. The Act also included a provision enabling the Court “in deciding dependency to disregard the earnings of the widow from work to which she had been directed, or which she had taken up during the war,” thereby safeguarding widows whose work could end with the war, and who “might then be dependent on compensation for her late husband’s accident.” ...|$|E

Data was collected through a focus group interview of 20 highly experienced dispute resolution practitioners from engineering and the law. The group was assembled from members of FIDIC-NET with direct experience of project DABs. The part reported here concerns practice and procedure for establishing DABs. The main findings are that: constitution of the DABs is often delayed because of either project owners' ignorance of the DAB process or deterrence by the cost of the DABs; such owners also tend to insist on appointing DAB members from local engineers and lawyers without sufficient understanding of the DAB process; <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> <b>of</b> DAB members vary widely; the training provision for DAB membership and advocacy skills is inadequate; the process of selecting candidates for DAB membership and negotiating the tripartite agreement between each member and the contractual parties needs to be navigated with great care to avoid raising ethical problems. The research contribution is threefold. First, it highlights the importance of realistic fees for DAB members within a standard framework in achieving timely establishment of a board that works well as a team. Second, it illustrates the use of qualitative focus group interview to study the impact of new contract terms from multiple stakeholder perspectives. Finally, it identifies areas where further research is needed...|$|R

The different methods on which their work is undertaken, and the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> that they receive, have been already touched on, in the chapter on the [...] "Cornish People." [...] It will be found that ordinary wages for mine labour, are there stated as ranging from forty to fifty shillings a month--mention being made at the same time, <b>of</b> the larger <b>remuneration</b> which may be obtained by working [...] "on tribute," [...] or, in other words, by agreeing to excavate the lodes of metal for a per-centage which varies with the varying value of the mineral raised. It is, however, necessary to add here, that, although men who labour on this latter plan, occasionally make as much as six or ten pounds each, in a month, they are on the other hand liable to heavy losses from the speculative character of the work in which they engage. The lode may, for instance, be poor when they begin to work it, and may continue poor as they proceed farther and farther. Under these circumstances, the low value of the mineral they have raised, realizes a correspondingly low <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> per-centage; and when this happens, the best workmen cannot make more than twenty shillings a month.|$|R

The impresarios first breached an agreement with Thomas Blagrave, acting Master of the Revels,and were sued for the vast sum of £ 201. They then allegedly broke their contract with John Hind, haberdasher of London, whose two sons had been engaged as adolescent actors.

Charles, Lord Howard, who subsequently became the most important patron of Elizabethan drama, plays a significant role in events leading up to the litigation.

40|$|Workshop DIn 1999 the Hordaland County Council {{decided that}} the county should {{introduce}} so-called ”quality contracts” for public transport in the county. The main idea {{of this type of}} contract is that decisions on the level of service (routes and frequencies) are left to the operators while the fares are subject to regulation by the county. A basic ingredient of such contracts should be a remuneration scheme linked to the level of service. The purpose <b>of</b> the <b>remuneration</b> is to internalise the impacts on consumers’ surplus caused by changes in the level of service. This impact is inadequately captured by the changes in fare revenue. Theory gives some guidance with respect to the principle <b>of</b> proper <b>remuneration.</b> A model was calibrated {{for each of the three}} main bus operators in Hordaland and used to estimate the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> that would induce the operator to provide an optimum level of service based on maximisation of profit. Modelling indicated that the remuneration schemes should consist for fixed rates per revenue kilometre and vehicle hour of revenue service for basic services and additional peak services respectively. Due to substantial deviation between fare and marginal cost for peak passengers, two operators should also have a remuneration per peak passengers. Modelling also showed that the sum of fare revenue and remuneration per km, hour and peak passenger would imply excessive profits and that the contracts therefor should include the deduction of a fixed amount. This is a novel and promising approach to contracting for public transport services. The heavy reliance on modelling means that the stakeholders must have confidence in the model and the results produced. In year 2000, contracts were implemented in the County of Hordaland based on these principles and results from modelling...|$|R

The paper also includes new analysis of improved data on the 1958 cohort at 33 in 1991, and a comparison with our earlier analyses of the 1946 cohort at 32 in 1978 and the 1958 cohort at 33 in 1991. The analysis is of hourly earnings in full-time jobs, where the impact of the Equal Pay Act might be expected to be more complete, given the lack of male comparators in the extensive but low paid part-time employment sector for women. We decompose the wage gap at each age, and the change in the components of the average wage gap over time. We also examine the distribution of estimated gender premia across our samples and relate them to the wage level. For people in their early thirties, the crude wage gap closed between 1978 and 2000, but this was mainly due to improved human capital characteristics of the women in full-time employment at that stage of their lives. Unequal treatment also fell, but not by much. When following the 1958 cohort from age 33 to age 42 in 2000, men’s real wages rose more than women’s. The increased gap was roughly equally due to widening differentials in characteristics and deteriorating <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> for women entering middle age. Although the 42 year-old employees included women with less exceptional qualifications, who had returned to the labour force with interrupted employment histories, women who had been relatively continuously in employment also experienced the rising gender penalty over time...|$|R

The {{aim of the research}} is to analyse the theoretical aspects of the gender balance and diversity management in companies, to explore the situation of the gender proportion within the large companies of Latvia and to identify the factors that contribute to the growth of the women representation within the TOP management. The European Commission (EC) has set the target to reach the women representation up to 40 % within the management of companies by 2020 and encourages the EU Member States on the application of the legislative quotas. Latvia is among those EU countries that has expressed official position against the introduction of quotas within the legislation, and thus, is seeking for other opportunities to stimulate gender balance within the companies. Latvia is a newcomer and lacks research in this field that emphasises the novelty of this paper. The paper investigates the gender situation in order to determine to what extent the ‘glass ceiling’ affects women's career growth in large companies of Latvia. Moreover, the paper analyses the benefits of the gender diversity to be used as incentive for the large companies of Latvia. The article has been prepared based on the analysis of primary and secondary sources, outcome synthesis and the evaluation of results of a survey of employees of large companies of Latvia (n= 211) and survey of HR managers of large companies (n= 50).

40|$|The article {{describes}} technical {{change and the}} difficulty in analysing it due to the hard variables which need {{to be dealt with}} in analytical terms. The Author sustains that the statistical data came as quite a surprise to economists, because their theories, from the Ricardian to the neo-classical, did not lead them to expect such results. The Author criticizes the limited approach commonly used by economists (ratios of production to man-hours) to interpret the outcomes of changes in technology, while not considering the introduction of capital. A case study of the United States from 1929 - 1950 is provided which shows that, on the average and in the long run, shares of labour and capital in the national product did not change very much, that wages did not remain at the subsistence level but rose in proportion to national income, that capital per man indeed increased but output per man also increased in proportion, and that the <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> of capital remained almost constant. The Author analyses the traditional concepts of technical change in making capital itself and suggests a procedure for evaluating it, with respect to all factors of production. This article – fruit of LLP’s stay at Harvard University in 1957 - 58 – became the basis of a controversy with Professor Robert Solow who published, in the same issue of the Journal a “Comment” (pp. 282 - 85) followed by a “Reply” by the Author (pp. 285 - 86). Solow and the Author dealt with two alternative procedures for measuring the increases in productivity of the economy of the United States {{in the first half of}} the 20 th century. Solow’s methodology was founded on an application of the traditional (neoclassical) production function. The Author’s methodology instead applied the concepts of the theory of capital – at that time novel –developed in Cambridge, England, mainly by Joan Robinson. The Author pointed out that, in evaluating the increases in productivity, it is essential to distinguish the variations in time of the capital/labour ratio from those of the capital/output ratio. Solow claimed to have measured a shift in time of the production function and, at the same time, a movement of the economic system along the same production function, with a resulting increase in capital intensity, with a procedure that left a significant residue entirely unexplained. The Author was able to demonstrate, using the same data, that Solow’s conclusions were contradictory: the capital/output ratio and the capital/labour ratio, in the period considered, varied in opposite directions: Capital intensity if expressed by changes in capital/output ratio, as Harrod’s model would have required, had decreased over the period considered; not increased as Solow affirmed. There was indeed an increase of the capital/labour ratio, which implied an increase, not of capital intensity, which had decreased as just said, but of the degree of mechanisation. Thus, Solow’s result made it impossible to gauge whether in the period investigated, capitalistic production had increased or decreased...|$|E

In addition, recent studies showed that leptin plays an important role in T lymphocyte responses. To examine the role of leptin in Ag-induced arthritis, the development of joint inflammation was assessed in immunized leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob), +/?, and wild-type mice (+/+) following the administration of methylated BSA into the knees. The results showed that ob/ob mice developed less severe arthritis compared with control mice. The levels of IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha mRNA in the synovium of arthritic knees were lower in ob/ob than in +/? mice. In vitro Ag-specific T cell proliferative responses were significantly decreased in ob/ob mice with lower IFN-gamma and higher IL- 10 production, suggesting a shift toward a Th 2 -type response in ob/ob mice. The serum levels of anti-methylated BSA Abs of any isotype were significantly decreased in arthritic ob/ob mice compared with controls. Essentially identical results were obtained in db/db mice, which lack the expression of the long isoform of leptin receptor. By RT-PCR, we observed that B lymphocytes express leptin receptor mRNA, indicating that in addition to its effect on the cellular response, leptin may exert a direct effect on B cell function. In conclusion, leptin contributes to the mechanisms of joint inflammation in Ag-induced arthritis by regulating both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses...|$|E

S. economy’s experience {{over the past}} two centuries leads to a view of technological change (broadly conceived) as having not been “neutral” in its effects upon growth. The specific meaning of “non-neutrality” in this context is that technical and organizational innovation had effects upon the derived demands for factors of production, and these tended to alter the relative prices of the heterogeneous array of productive assets in the economy. By directly and indirectly impinging on relative real <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>remuneration</b> established in the markets for particular types of human labor and skill, and for the services of specific tangible and intangible capital, “technological change” altered key conditions governing the absolute and relative growth <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> the various macroeconomic factors of production. On the other hand, because innovation exhibited strong cumulative features reflecting the influence of “localized learning,” past domestic factor market conditions exerted a persisting influence upon the globally non-neutral trajectory of American technological and organizational development. This essay thus explores two broad and related historical themes. Firstly, the non- neutrality of the impacts of innovations on the demand side of the markets for productive inputs implies that “innovation” should be understood as contributing to complex interactions among all the proximate “sources of growth. ” Even though the latter are usually presented by exercises in “growth accounting” as distinct and separate dynamic elements contributing to the rise of labor productivity and per capita real output, the identification of the total factor productivity “residual” as the “contribution” of technological change is mistaken in ignoring the quantitatively important effect of successive capital- deepening “traverses” to the growth of labor productivity. The second theme underscores a fundamental contrast between the twentieth and the nineteenth century growth processes, in regard to the impacts of the predominant “bias” of the direction of innovation: the relative shift away from the accumulation of stocks of tangible reproducible capital and towards the formation of intangible productive assets by in investments in education, training and the search for new scientific and technological knowledge. ...|$|R
