40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyse the steel refining technology in a ladle furnace including refining slag formation in the ladle. The research was conducted using chromium-nickel- molybdenum steel intended for heat treatment in order to produce crankshafts. Design/methodology/approach: This research was conducted in a ladle furnace with the capacity of 65 Mg of steel. Data from 10 melts were analysed. Samples of refining slag and metal were taken to analyse their chemical composition. On their basis researchers analysed the process <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> steel at the ladle furnace workstation. Calculations were made concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag to determine the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations. The calculations were made using a thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. Findings: Analysing the process <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> steel under slag with the average chemical composition of: CaO – 54. 0 %, Al 2 O 3 - 30. 2 %, SiO 2 9. 0 %, MgO – 8. 2 %, and FeO content at the level of 0. 94 % drew attention to a high degree <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> at the level of 86 %. Due to this fact it was possible to obtain high basicity of slag: V=CaO/SiO 2 at the level of 6. 21. Mannesmann index, which characterizes the ability of slag to remove sulphur and non-metallic inclusions from steel and is defined as M=(CaO/SiO 2) /Al 2 O 3, amounted to 0. 21 %- 1 and was too low in comparison to the required one ranging from 0. 35 - 0. 45 %- 1. The calculations concerning the equilibrium chemical composition of slag, which determined the share of gas phase, liquid phase and solid precipitations, were performed using the thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. These calculations showed that there were no solid precipitations present. The refining process under slag used in this research proved to be extremely efficient in terms <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation.</b> Research limitations/implications: It was concluded that the slag forming technology in the ladle is correct in terms of materials used, both as far as their type and amount are concerned. Deoxidation is efficient. Practical implications: It is important to ensure that the furnace slag does not enter the ladle. As a result, {{it will be possible to}} improve the quality of the refining slag. Using the thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2 can contribute to modifying the chemical composition of the refining slag and result in an improvement of refinement as well as a better protection of the refractory lining of the ladle. Originality/value: In order to calculate the equilibrium chemical composition of slag researchers used the thermodynamic software FactSage 6. 2. Its use in practice can help select slag forming materials that are characterized by high refining parameter...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to design a {{desulphurisation}} device for the pulverized coal boiler K 3 in heating plant Olomouc. In this boiler, coal with sulphur content is burnt. Emissions SOx from the boiler output are {{much higher than the}} emission limits for SOx, which comes into force 1. 1. 2016. Therefore it is necessary to build a desulphurisation device, which will cause a significant reduction of SOx emissions and compliance with the emission limits. The thesis consists of two parts - theoretical and practical. The theoretical part states SO 2 emission limits and describes various methods for flue gas desulphurisation. In the practical part I chose a semi-dry desulphurisation method with fluid reactor. It determines a stoichiometric amount of combustion air and determines the boiler efficiency.

40|$|Combustion {{of organic}} sulphur {{compounds}} in fossil fuels releases SO 2, a major air pollutant. Dibenzothiophene (DBT) is a representative organic sulphur compound in fossil fuels, and its desulphurisation by living cells, resting cells and enzymes of a soil bacterium was investigated. The strain could grow on DBT, but its maximum growth was obtained {{in a medium}} of DBT plus thiamine (50 mg/l). GC-MS analysis reveals that the strain transformed DBT to 2 -hydroxybiphenyl (2 HBP), a desulphurised compound with the intact carbon skeleton of DBT. The biotransformation was via an intermediate of dibenzothiophene sulphone (DBTS). The organic sulphur was utilised for cell reproduction and little sulphur was left as sulphate in the medium. DBT desulphurisation, associated with cell growth, was promoted or depressed by inorganic sulphate depending on sulphate concentration. A high extracellular sulphate concentration (> 0. 1 mM) repressed the expression <b>of</b> DBT <b>desulphurisation</b> enzymes, but below this level the enzymes were expressed very well with good growth {{as well as a}} stoichiometric biotransformation of DBT to 2 HBP. If no sulphate except DBT was supplied as a sulphur source, only about one-third <b>of</b> DBT <b>desulphurisation</b> and cell growth were achieved compared with those in the presence of both DBT and thiamine (or sulphate). DBT desulphurisation could also be carried out in a crude enzyme solution if NADH cofactor was added. The DBT content in the enzymic solution was reduced from 2. 45 to 2. 06 mM. giving 0. 389 mM 2 HBP in 45 min. DBT was also desulphurised by the resting cells of the bacterial strain, but NADH cofactor was not needed. Accumulation of 2 HBP, the final product <b>of</b> DBT <b>desulphurisation,</b> had an inhibitory effect on both cell growth and DBT desulphurisation. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we have {{looked into the}} {{qualitative}} analysis of coals in Bosnia and Herzegovina (B-H). The analysis includes the following characteristics: moisture (W), ash (A), combustible matter (Vg) and lower heating value (Hd). From the statistic parameters we have determined: absolute range (R), arithmetic mean (X), standard deviation (S) and variations coefficient (Cv). It {{has been shown that}} the coal characteristics (W, A, Vg, Hd) have normal distribution. The analysis show that there are considerable deviations of ash characteristics: moisture (36. 23 %), ash (34. 21 %), combustible matter (16. 15 %) and lower heating value (25. 16 %) from the mean value which is shown by the variations coefficient (Cv). Large oscilations of mass portions: W, A, Vg and Hd around the mean value can adversely influence the function of a boiler plant and an electric filter plant in thermal power plants in B-H in which the mentioned types of coal burn. Large ash oscilations (34. 21 %) around the mean value point out to the inability of application of dry procedures <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> <b>of</b> smoke gasses (FGD) due to the additional quantity of ash.

Oxidation of phosphorus from hot metal has been studied by several authors {{since the early days}} of steelmaking. Influence of different parameters on the distribution of phosphorus, seen during the recent work of the authors, differs somewhat from that reported earlier. On the other hand, removal of sulphur during steelmaking has drawn much less attention. This may be due to the magnitude <b>of</b> <b>desulphurisation</b> in oxygen steelmaking being relatively low and desulphurisation during hot metal pre-treatment or in the ladle furnace offering better commercial viability Further, it is normally accepted that sulphur is removed to steelmaking slag in the form of sulphide only However, recent investigations have indicated that a significant amount of sulphur removed during basic oxygen steelmaking can exist in the form of sulphate in the slag under oxidising conditions. The distribution of sulphur during steelmaking becomes more important in the event of carry-over of sulphur-rich blast-furnace slag, which increases sulphur load in the BOF.
