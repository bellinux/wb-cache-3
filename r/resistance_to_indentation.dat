The anatomical characteristics showed variations in fibre length; fibre diameter; fibre lumen diameter; fibre cell wall thickness; number of fibres per field of view; number of vessels per field of view; vessel diameter in the tangential direction and in the derived values: Runkel ratio; slenderness ratio and coefficient of flexibility. Variations occurred also among the species in all the strength parameters assessed, which include compression; tension; indentation; cleavage and shear. The statistical analysis showed significant differences among the means tested for in the ten timber species (P = 0. 05). Anatomical parameters with highly significant correlations- positive or negative were of good strength predictive potentials. The strength prediction equation (Ŷ = bx + a) was derived {{for each of the}} strength parameters assessed and the validity of these equations determined. When the mean of any of the anatomical parameters (x) is substituted in the equation, the corresponding strength could be worked out. Species with longer fibres offered less <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> compression, <b>indentation</b> and tensile forces. Fibre diameter showed no significant correlations with any of the strength parameters and therefore was not of any predictive value.

Marginal bands from erythrocytes of the newt (Notopthalmus viridescens) were isolated from the cells as intact structures by treatment with detergent and either mild protease or high salt. Isolated bands were subjected to mechanical testing by stretching the band between a glass microhook and a calibrated glass fiber. The deflection of the fiber provided {{a measure of the}} force on the band. The flexural rigidity of the band was determined from measurements of the band deformation as a function of applied force.

Treatment of bands with chymopapain caused an increase in band rigidity and inelastic behavior. Estimates of the contribution of the band to cellular rigidity are made based on the measurements of the structural properties of the isolated band.

In this work we have used a dystrophic mdx mouse crossed with the global P 2 RX 7 receptor to generate a knockout mouse (mdx/P 2 X 7 −/−), and compared its morphometric, mechanical and tissue properties against those of mdx, as well as the wild type (WT) and the P 2 RX 7 knockout (P 2 X 7 −/-). Micro-computed tomography (µCT), three-point bending testing, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nano-indentation were utilised in the study. The bones were analysed at approximately 4 weeks of age to examine the impact of P 2 RX 7 ablation on the bone properties during the acute disease phase, before muscle wasting is fully developed. The results show that P 2 RX 7 purinoceptor ablation has produced improvement or significant improvement in some of the morphological, the mechanical and the tissue properties of the dystrophic bones examined. Specifically, although the ablation produced smaller bones with significantly lower total cross-section area (Tt. Ar) and Second Moment of Area (SMA), significantly higher cortical bone area (Ct.

The numerical result is correlated with the data based on analytical approaches for both homogenous materials and elastic half space with an embedded stiffer layer. The influence of Poisson’s ratio and auxeticity of the matrix on the deformation and indentation stiffness of the material system under different conditions (indenter size, sheet thickness and embedment depth) were established and main influences of the Poisson’s ratio on the material deformation and stresses are discussed.

40|$|The present work is {{concerned}} with problems related to grounding of ships. This ranges from prediction of fracture to analysis of hull girder loads during grounding. The thesis is composed {{as a collection of}} articles and consists of two parts. The first part gives an introduction to the topic and summarizes the findings from the PhD. work. The second part presents the articles. A significant part of the thesis is dedicated to the work on fracture. Reliable prediction of fracture initiation and propagation is essential in order to estimate the hull indentation resistance and the oil spill during grounding. In order to better predict the onset of fracture two relatively advanced criteria are investigated. These are the BWH instability criterion, Alsos et al. (2008 b), and the RTCL damage criterion, Töornqvist (2003), respectively. These criteria are implemented into LS-DYNA by the author and verified by finite element simulations. In addition, problems related to mesh sensitivity close to the point of fracture is discussed. An attempt to improve the existing way of dealing with this effect is made. The response of stiffened panels subjected to extreme lateral loads is investigated by testing. The panels are indented to and beyond the point of fracture. The experimental results are further compared with numerical simulations where fracture is predicted using the BWH and the RTCL failure criterion. An important issue in problems related to ship grounding is {{the size and shape of}} the sea floor. As information about this is generally limited, this is discussed in view of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> which is typical for grounding at various sea floor geometries. From this, characteristic scenarios are defined. The <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> is analyzed for a typical oil tanker for various positions of contact. The interaction between global hull girder bending effects and local indentation actions is also addressed. Ships which run aground with forward speed may suffer hull damage over the entire girder length. Analysis of this is made complex by the temporal and spatial extent which this implies. Thus, complete finite element simulation becomes very demanding. A new, simplified approach to estimate the contact actions and the subsequent damage due to grounding is therefore presented. Excellent agreement is obtained between the simplified procedure and numerical simulations. The application of the simplified sliding force method is illustrated by simplified simulations of dynamic/powered grounding. It has been shown that the process is indeed dynamic and that large hull girder bending moments and shear forces are formed, especially during the initial impact. These shear forces and bending moments may become larger than the minimum still water rule requirements set by the classification society. This correlates well with observations made by Pedersen (1994) and Simonsen (1997 a). PhD i marin teknikkPhD in Marine Technolog...|$|E

In the current work, grain boundary associated pop-in events were observed in a Fe- 0. 01 wt% C polycrystal (bcc), and this is characteristic of high <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> intergranular slip transfer.

40|$|In {{this study}} it is {{attempted}} to predict brittle-to-ductile transitions (BDTs) in polystyrene blends, induced either {{by an increase}} in temperature or by a decrease in inter-particle distance. A representative, two-dimensional volume element (RVE) of a polystyrene matrix with 20 % circular voids, is deformed in tension. During deformation a hydrostatic-stress based craze-nucleation criterion [1] is evaluated. The simulations demonstrate that crazes initiate at low temperatures while a transition from crazing to shear yielding (BDT) is found around 75 8 C. The numerical results correlate well with tensile tests on similar heterogeneous polystyrene. The presence of an absolute length, as experimentally found, is more difficult to explain. Near a free surface a Tg-depression is measured for polystyrene and also the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> in polystyrene is lower than expected from bulk properties. Both observations are rationalised by an enhanced segmental mobility of chains near a free surface. As a consequence of these findings, an absolute length-scale could be incorporated in the numerical simulations. For simplicity, the length-scale is modelled by taking a temperature gradient over a thin layer near the internal free surfaces of the RVE. Deformation of the RVE with different absolute length-scales shows that indeed also the experimentally found brittle-to-ductile transition can be predicted if the ligament thickness between the inclusions (‘voids’) in polystyrene is below a critical value of ca. 15 nm...|$|E

They concluded that the incorporation of these compounds leads directly to increasing hardness and that {{the part of the}} tooth impregnated with iron (as goethite) is about three times harder than that part impregnated with silica (assumed to be opal, but see below). For a number of reasons this interpretation of the results seems highly unlikely, not least that the hardness of goethite is 200 — 280, on the Vickers Diamond Hardness (VDH) scale yet the looth reaches hardnesses of over 500 in the part containing this mineral. To understand the other reasons why Runham's interpretation is doubtful it is necessary to understand something of hardness testing. The test most used to measure hardness is an indentation test which involves pressing a pointed diamond, cut to the shape of a four-sided pyramid and of a standard size, into the material under test using a known load for a known time. Since the diamond is tapered the size of the hole which it leaves in the material under test is proportional to the depth to which it has been pressed, so simple measurement of the side of the hole gives a measure of the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> of the material, or its "hardness".

Moreover, nanoindentation tests were performed in order to monitor the change in elastic modulus and hardness with MWCNT content and {{it was found that}} both properties decrease with the addition of MWCNT content. A novel method was used to measure the true fracture toughness of the composites by producing a shallow surface sharp notch machined by ultra-short pulsed laser ablation on the surface of beam specimens. The true fracture toughness obtained on this laser machined single edge V-notch beam (SEVNB) specimens tested in four point bending was compared to the indentation fracture toughness measured using a Vickers indenter. It was found that the indentation fracture toughness increases with increasing MWCNT content, while the true fracture toughness determined with SEVNB was practically independent of the composition. Finally, it was concluded that the increase in the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> cracking of the composites with respect to 3 Y-TZP matrix cannot be associated to higher true fracture toughness.

40|$|Published: November 30, 2015 To {{enhance the}} {{corrosion}} resistance, biocompatibility and mechanical durability of biomedical titanium alloys, a novel β-Ta 2 O 5 nanoceramic coating was developed using a double glow discharge plasma technique. The surface morphology, phase composition and microstructure of the as-deposited coating were examined by {{atomic force microscopy}} (AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The coating exhibits a striated structural pattern along the growth direction, which consists of equiaxed β-Ta 2 O 5 grains, 15 – 20 nm in diameter in cross-section, showing a strong (001) preferred orientation. The mechanical properties and contact damage resistance of the β-Ta 2 O 5 coating were evaluated by nanoindentation. Additionally, scratch tests were performed to evaluate the adhesion strength between the β-Ta 2 O 5 coating and the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V substrate. The β-Ta 2 O 5 coating shows high hardness combined with good <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> both <b>indentation</b> and scratch damage, thus favoring it for long-term load-bearing application in the human body. Electrochemical behavior of the coating was analyzed in both a 0. 9 wt % NaCl solution and Ringer’s solution at 37 °C, by various electrochemical analytical techniques, including potentiodynamic polarization, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, potential of zero charge and Mott–Schottky analysis. Compared with uncoated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V and commercially pure tantalum, the β-Ta 2 O 5 coating possesses a more positive Ecorr and lower icorr in both aqueous solutions, which is attributed to the thicker and denser β-Ta 2 O 5 coating that provides more effective protection against corrosive attack. In addition, the β-Ta 2 O 5 coating shows stable impedance behavior over 5 days immersion under both simulated body solutions, corroborated by the capacitance and resistance values extracted from the EIS data. Mott–Schottky analysis reveals that the β-Ta 2 O 5 coating shows n-type semiconductor behavior and its donor density is independent of immersion time in both aqueous solutions. Its donor density is {{of the order of}} 1 × 1019 cm– 3, which is an order of magnitude less than that of the passive films formed on either commercially pure Ta or uncoated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V. Moreover, according to the differences between corrosion potential and potential of zero charge, the β-Ta 2 O 5 coating exhibits a greater propensity to repulse chloride ions than both commercially pure Ta and uncoated Ti- 6 Al- 4 V.

Indents were created using 5, 20, and 30 kg loads to obtain the hardness. Optical microscopy, white-light interferometry, and a coordinate measuring machine were then used to observe the crack lengths and crack geometry. Palmqvist and half-penny median crack profiles were found, which dictated {{the selection of the}} group of equations used herein. Computational and analytical approaches were then adapted to determine the K 1 c of ZrO 2. It was found that the best applicable equation was: K 1 c = 0. 016 (E/H) 1 / 2 (P/c 3 / 2), which was confirmed to be 42 per cent accurate in producing K 1 c values within the range of 8 to 12 MPa m 1 / 2 for ZrO 2. Fibre laser surface treatment reduced the surface hardness and produced smaller crack lengths in comparison with the as-received surface. The surface crack lengths, hardness, and indentation loads were found to be important, particularly the crack length, which significantly influenced the end K 1 c value when K 1 c = 0. 016 (E/H) 1 / 2 (P/c 3 / 2) was used. This is because, the longer the crack lengths, the lower the ceramic's <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation.</b> This, in turn, increased the end K 1 c value. Also, the hardness influences the K 1 c, and a softer surface was produced by the fibre laser treatment; this resulted in higher resistance to crack propagation and enhanced the ceramic's K 1 c. Increasing the indentation load also varied the end K 1 c value, as higher indentation loads resulted in a bigger diamond footprint, and the ceramic exhibited longer crack lengths...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{responses}} of three gamma titanium aluminides (TiAls) (denoted as Alloy A, Alloy B and Alloy C) subjected to dynamic scratching were studied {{by using a}} single-grit pendulum (rotating) scratch tester. The maximum depth of groove was {approx} 0. 07 mm, and the scratch velocity was {approx} 1. 0 m/s. Normal and tangential forces were monitored. The material removal mechanisms were examined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the scratches were measured by using a laser profilometer. The mechanical properties of the tested TiAls were characterized by the instantaneous specific energy, scratch resistance and scratch hardness as related to the groove depth. Extensive thermal softening was observed in the dynamic scratch test of the TiAls, which facilitated both the detachment of developing chips and pile-up of material on side ridges. Sizable fractures were observed in the transverse direction in the tested TiAls; these fractures tended {{to participate in the}} chip formation, depending on the microstructure of the TiAl {{and the size of the}} scratch groove. Specific energy and scratch hardness are depth-dependent to various degrees for the TiAls tested. The material removal might be subjected to different mechanisms, but the overall material response can be effectively characterized by the HEM (Hwang, Evans and Malkin) model and the PSR (proportional specimen resistance) model. The depth-independent specific energy and scratch hardness can be used to screen candidate materials for the applications that are scratch-dominated versus impact-dominated. Among the three tested TiAls, the TiAl with larger colony or grain size exhibits a stronger capability of energy dissipation during material removal (higher depth-independent specific energy), while the TiAl with smaller colony size shows a higher <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> (higher depth-independent scratch hardness). The observations and conclusions in this study can serve as a base line for the further characterization of the related materials under the service temperature as recommended for diesel engine...|$|E
40|$|We have {{directly}} {{measured the}} contribution of dystrophin to the cortical stiffness of living muscle cells and have demonstrated that lack of dystrophin causes a substantial reduction in stiffness. The inferred molecular structure of dystrophin, its preferential localization underlying the cell surface, and the apparent fragility of muscle cells which lack this protein suggest that dystrophin stabilizes the sarcolemma and protects the myofiber from disruption during contraction. Lacking dystrophin, the muscle cells of persons with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) are abnormally vulnerable. These facts suggest that muscle cells with dystrophin should be stiffer than similar cells which lack this protein. We have tested this hypothesis by measuring the local stiffness of the membrane skeleton of myotubes cultured from mdx mice and normal controls. Like humans with DMD mdx mice lack dystrophin due to an x-linked mutation and provide a good model for the human disease. Deformability was measured as the <b>resistance</b> <b>to</b> <b>indentation</b> of a small area of the cell surface (to a depth of 1 micron) by a glass probe 1 micron in radius. The stiffness of the membrane skeleton was evaluated as the increment of force (mdyne) per micron of indentation. Normal myotubes with an average stiffness value of 1. 23 +/- 0. 04 (SE) mdyne/micron were about fourfold stiffer than myotubes cultured from mdx mice (0. 34 +/- 0. 014 mdyne/micron). We verified by immunofluorescence that both normal and mdx myotubes, which were at a similar developmental stage, expressed sarcomeric myosin, and that dystrophin was detected, diffusely distributed, only in normal, not in mdx myotubes. These results confirm that dystrophin and its associated proteins can reinforce the myotube membrane skeleton by increasing its stiffness and that dystrophin function and, therefore, the efficiency of therapeutic restoration of dystrophin can be assayed through its mechanical effects on muscle cells...|$|E
