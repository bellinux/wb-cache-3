40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{analysis}} is to identify and evaluate the functional space and spatial relationship requirements for the two main nuclear buildings, the Waste Handling Building (WHB) and the Waste Treatment Building (WTB), which {{are part of the}} Repository Surface Facilities. This analysis is consistent with the Development Plan for ''WHB/WTB Space Program Analysis for Site Recommendation'' (CRWMS M&O 2000 r), which concentrates on the primary, primary support, facility support, and miscellaneous building support areas located in the WHB and WTB. The development plan was completed in accordance with AP- 2. 134, ''Technical Product Development Planning''. The objective and scope of this analysis is to develop a set of spatial parameters (e. g., square footage, <b>room</b> <b>heights,</b> etc.) and layout requirements (e. g., adjacency and access/circulation requirements, etc.) from which preliminary building floor plans are developed and presented as figures. The resulting figures will provide information to support the Site Recommendation and the total system life cycle cost. This analysis uses the Viability Assessment (VA) ''Surface Nuclear Facilities Space Program Analysis'' (SPA) (CRWMS M&O 1997 c) as the baseline reference document and further develops the functional requirements based on Project-directed changes, including incorporation of a new design basis waste stream and the applicable elements of Enhanced Design Alternative (EDA) -II, as identified in the ''License Application Design Selection Report'' (CRWMS M&O 1999 e), which followed the initial SPA (baseline). The impacts of the EDA-II were almost entirely to the WHB. To meet the EDA-II thermal requirements, hotter fuel would be handled, therefore requiring a fuel-blending pool {{to be added to the}} WHB in order to age the hotter he 1 at the repository and provide for commercial spent nuclear fuel (CSNF) blending. In addition to EDA-II recommendations, the waste stream was modified, including the elimination of approximately 300 multi-purpose canisters from the CSNF schedule. The bases for the Monitored Geologic Repository (MGR) surface design changes, as a result of the waste stream changes, are defined in ''Calculations from Surface Facilities Operations in Support of the Revision to the Waste Quantity, Mix, and Throughput Study'' (CRWMS M&O 2000 c, Section 2. 4). This effort resulted in a reduction in the number of canister transfer lines from 2 to 1. In addition, as indicated in ''WITNESS Model Input for Thermal Blending of Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Assemblies'' (CRWMS M&O 19991), the quantity of dual-purpose canisters (DPCs) assumed to be shipped to the repository has been reduced by about 37 percent. This change resulted in a reduction of the number of Assembly Transfer System (ATS) lines in the WHB from 3 to 2. In summary, this analysis is intended to provide a preliminary level of design showing room square footages and heights associated with the WHB and WTB. These spatial dimensions are anticipated to increase or decrease as the design progresses...|$|E

40|$|A {{model for}} {{displacement}} ventilation {{system based on}} plume rise of single point heat source was developed. The errors for temperature gradient ratio were less than 6 % in most cases. Errors for temperature gradient and displacement zone height were relatively higher (up to 28. 1 %) which {{might be due to}} the derivation of the parameters from experimental data. Still, the errors were lower than those from design model/method of some other workers (68. 5 % for the temperature gradient ratio and 15. 7 % for the temperature difference between the supply air and at 0. 1 m above floor level). With a <b>room</b> <b>height</b> of 2. 4 m (common for office in Hong Kong) and design room temperature 25. 5 °C defined at 1. 1 m above floor level under the normal load to air flow ratio of 12, 000 W/m 3 /s (typical values for sub-tropical region) and minimum supply temperature of 18 °C, there existed a zone capacity range from 1000 to 5000 W that stand alone operation displacement ventilation system was feasible and that the displacement zone height (minimum 2. 2 m) was above normal breathing level. The feasible zone capacity range diminished with decrease in design room temperature and/or <b>room</b> <b>height.</b> In this case, the load to air flow ratio had to be reduced, resulting in a higher flow rate when compared to a mixing ventilation system, or an auxiliary cooling facility such as a chilled ceiling had to be used. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|Abstract. Kapok fibre {{possesses}} high {{thermal resistance}} and can retard {{the rate of}} heat flow into the building through the roof. Reduced heat flow into the building leads to reduction in the use of room air-conditioners that improves indoor thermal comfort, leading to lower electricity bills. Additionally, the cost of insulation increases with its thickness. Therefore, determining the optimum thickness of insulation is essential to maximize the cost savings over the service period of insulation. In this study, a house model design with a floor dimension of 3 m by 3 m, <b>room</b> <b>height</b> of 2. 5 m and roof slope of 45 ° is employed to determine the optimum thickness of kapok fibre insulation for a placement below roof pitch of residential buildings under hot-humid climate and it is associated with cost savings.

The aim of our research was to see which the influence of the room geometry on the mean radiant temperature is, assuming similar heating systems and thermal properties of the building envelope. It was found that mean radiant temperature has a parabolic variation with the <b>room</b> <b>height</b> and length, so for a room shape there is a certain height for which the mean radiant temperature is minimal.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} novel {{possibility}} of utilising the structural concrete floor slab {{as a means}} of providing additional mid to low frequency sound absorption through the addition of cavities on the ceiling side, formed using flexible formwork, acting as Helmholtz resonators. Mid to low frequency sound absorption in rooms is typically achieved through the use of perforated plasterboard or a suspended tile-in-grid system. Such an approach can separate the room from the thermal mass of the ceiling above, leading to higher peak temperatures or increased cooling load. Suspended ceilings can also increase the embodied energy of the building and limit the potential for stack effect ventilation by reducing <b>room</b> <b>height.</b> In this work, frequency dependent absorption coefficients of perforated concrete samples were measured using an impedance tube test.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the range of}} collimation errors in x-ray rooms and to calculate their possible effects on the radiation dose for anteroposterior pelvic examinations. Methods: A collimator test tool was suspended at 3 heights (14, 21, and 28 cm) above the table Bucky in 9 x-ray <b>rooms.</b> <b>Heights</b> corresponded to the typical patient thickness (mean, ± 2 SD) of 67 patients undergoing anteroposterior pelvic radiography. The x-ray beam was visually collimated to the inner boundary of the test tool and exposed to radiation.

Next, using a pelvic phantom, minimum textbook collimation was set and then changed and verified to simulate a range of possible collimation errors.
