30|$|To {{study the}} {{real-time}} active power balance control {{in a power}} system with high wind power penetration level, the <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> is exemplified on the future Danish power system corresponding to year 2020, where 50  % of the total electricity production has to be supplied by wind power [7]. The balanced regulating power plan, in a 5  min resolution, for generation and power exchange with neighbouring power systems is provided by hour-ahead (HA) power balancing program. However, wind power forecast errors and other events might cause a power imbalance in the real time, which can be partially compensated by activating the additional regulating power with a <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> and the coordinated AGC response. The <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> activates the regulating power from CHPs, to minimize the real time power imbalance in the power system.|$|E
30|$|The {{real-time}} power balancing concept provided above activates the regulating power {{while taking}} in account the maximum and minimum limits on generating units, dispatch limits and the generation cost. However, {{to implement the}} above concept, {{in addition to the}} above constraints, the coordinated AGC and <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> must also take the transmission constraints in account.|$|E

40|$|When Borealis, a European {{producer}} of plastics, used a traditional, time-consuming budgeting process, the budget was quickly {{out of date}} in a competitive environment characterized by continually changing input and output prices and dynamic market conditions. This case describes the process that led Borealis to replace its budgets with four targeted management tools: <b>rolling</b> financial forecasts, <b>Balanced</b> Scorecard, activity based costing, and investment management. It also discusses the process of implementing the new measurement and control systems...|$|R
30|$|The {{article is}} {{organised}} as follows. First the dynamic power system model is described. The active power balancing models {{and the proposed}} algorithm “rolling balance” are then presented and explained. The performance of the <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> and the AGC is then assessed through simulations for the year 2020 with high wind penetration scenarios and the conclusive remarks are reported at the end.|$|E
30|$|In this study, power {{mismatch}} between generation and load appears from the HA balanced power system, if the actual wind power generated within the operating hour {{differs from the}} forecast. In {{order to maintain the}} balance power system operation within the operating hour, the speed governors instantly provides the primary response and then the AGC along with <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> compensates the power imbalance.|$|E
30|$|It can {{be noticed}} that the power {{imbalance}} has decreased substantially with the proposed active power balance technique, i.e. when real-time control is provided with coordinated AGC and <b>rolling</b> <b>balance.</b> The conventional AGC also reduces the power imbalance in real-time, but the programmed activation of regulating bids and coordinated AGC assures the reliable operation of highly wind power integrated power system.|$|E
40|$|Here we {{prove the}} {{goodness}} property of adaptive rolling plans in a multisector {{optimal growth model}} under decreasing returns in deterministic environment. Goodness is achieved {{as a result of}} fast convergence (at an asymptotically geometric rate) of the <b>rolling</b> plan to <b>balanced</b> growth path. Further on, while searching for goodness, we give a new proof of strong concavity of an indirect utility function – this result is achieved just with help of some elementary matrix algebra and differential calculus. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} physically-based system to {{simulate}} {{and control the}} locomotion of soft body characters without skeletons. We use the finite element method to simulate the deformation of the soft body, and we instrument a character with muscle fibers {{to allow it to}} actively control its shape. To perform locomotion, we use a variety of intuitive controls such as moving a point on the character, specifying the center of mass or the angular momentum, and maintaining balance. These controllers yield an objective function that is passed to our optimization solver, which handles convex quadratic program with linear complementarity constraints. This solver determines the new muscle fiber lengths, and moreover it determines whether each point of contact should remain static, slide, or lift away from the floor. Our system can automatically find an appropriate combination of muscle contractions that enables a soft character to fulfill various locomotion tasks, including walking, jumping, crawling, <b>rolling</b> and <b>balancing...</b>|$|R
30|$|The studies {{performed}} and {{presented in this}} article illustrate how power imbalances between load and generation, caused by wind power forecast error can be compensated effectively by the automatic activation of regulating power bids from conventional power plants and also by regulating the active power production from combined heat and power plants and wind power plants. The <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> is designed to activate the regulating bids while the coordinated automatic generation control provides the required secondary response from combined heat and power plants and wind power plants.|$|E
30|$|The {{importance}} of the regulating bids and of their effective activation for a reliable and secure operation of large wind power integrated power system has been demonstrated though the present investigation. The activation of the regulating reserves through the <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> efficiently reduces the real time imbalances and thereby ensuring reliable power system operation. Furthermore the wind power plant integrated coordinated automatic generation control ensures the secure power system operation. However, better forecasting of wind speed and the load demand is still desirable for operational security of highly wind power integrated power system.|$|E
30|$|As aforementioned, the Danish {{power system}} {{is used to}} {{validate}} {{the performance of the}} <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> and the AGC. The Danish power system is composed of Eastern and Western Danish power systems, which are synchronously connected to the Nordic and Continental European (CE) synchronous power systems, respectively [8]. To study the active power balance control in the Danish power system, it requires a detailed dynamic representation of the power system that includes conventional power plants, WPPs and interconnection with neighbouring power systems. The system interconnections and the aggregated power plants models, developed in power factory, are explained below.|$|E

30|$|The {{electrical}} power generation in Denmark {{is a combination}} of conventional and renewable generation sources. The conventional power generation is typically from CHPs and de-centralised combined heat and power plants (DCHPs), while renewable generation is primary based on WPPs contribution. In this study, aggregated models for conventional power plants and WPPs are implemented, as they have the advantage of reduced computation effort, while still containing dynamic features relevant for long term dynamic simulation studies. These aggregated models are developed based on description found in [8, 13, 14, 15, 16] and takes the information from HA power balancing model, <b>rolling</b> <b>balance</b> and the AGC for power generation set points.|$|E
30|$|A set of {{simulations}} {{has been}} carried out to illustrate the performance of the power system model on the focus of active power balanced control. The simulations are performed using the time series for generation, load and power exchange generated by HA power balancing model (SimBa) for the Danish power system and are the assumptions for the year 2020 based on the real data from the year 2009. The conventional generation and the power exchange are using HA time series, while WPP generates the available wind power. Power imbalance appears within the operating hour, if HA wind power forecast {{is not the same as}} available wind power. This imbalance is compensated by AGC and by activating the regulating bids from CHPs within the operating hour by an algorithm (<b>rolling</b> <b>balance),</b> developed for this study.|$|E

A long standing {{question has been}} the relationship between developing gross and fine motor movements and cognitive achievement in elementary school children. This project developed a model motor screening procedure as demonstrated by a forty-eight minute video tape for use in detecting incoordination as it might relate to academic achievement. What coordination items are predictive of cognitive and awareness abilities? This project demonstrated that patterns of <b>rolling,</b> crawling, <b>balance</b> activities, eye tracking and symmetrical and asymmetrical hand activities determine coordination ability. That the level of co-ordination ability would influence cognitive performance would require additional research under strictly controlled conditions. This should include pre- and post-testing in motor control and academic achievement to allow comparative analysis and statistical support of the suggested hypothesis. Toward a diagnostic end, an independent empirical technique was developed for assessing coordination problems possibly leading to poor cognitive performance in school children, grades kindergarten through third grade, and a statistical model was generated upon which later work could be compared for additional data and theory development.

40|$|Water {{resources}} {{observation and}} prediction systems {{are being developed}} in the Australian Bureau of Meteorology to produce water information services, and will include <b>rolling</b> water <b>balance</b> estimation. A prototype Australian Water Resources Assessment Model (AWRAM) has been developed, and the nation-wide coverage, currency, accuracy, and consistency required means that remote sensing plays an important role. This paper tests and discusses alternative methods of blending models and observations. Integration of on-ground and remote sensing data into land surface models typically involves state updating through model-data assimilation techniques. By comparison, retrospective water balance estimation and hydrological scenario modelling to date has mostly relied on non-sequential parameter estimation against stream flow observations, and has made little use of satellite earth observation. The most appropriate model-data fusion approach for a continental water balance estimation system will {{need to consider the}} trade-off between accuracy gains when using more sophisticated synthesis techniques and additional observations, and the computational overheads this incurs. This trade-off was investigated using relatively simple but well-performing lumped models of seasonal vegetation dynamics and catchment hydrology that are implemented in the prototype AWRAM, while formal inter-comparison experiments to assess alternative component model paradigms and structures are underway...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{is made of}} the stability of an airplane with ailerons free, with {{particular attention to the}} motions when the ailerons have a tendency to float against the wind. The present analysis supersedes the aileron investigation contained in NACA Report No. 709. The equations of motion are first written to include yawing and sideslipping, and it is demonstrated that the principal effects of freeing the ailerons can be determined without regard to these motions. If the ailerons tend to float against the wind and have a high degree of aerodynamic <b>balance,</b> <b>rolling</b> oscillations, in addition to the normal lateral oscillations, are likely to occur. On the basis of the equations including only the rolling motion and the aileron deflection, formulas are derived for the stability and damping of the rolling oscillations in terms of the hinge moment derivatives and other characteristics of the ailerons and airplane. Charts are also presented showing the oscillatory regions and stability boundaries for a fictitious airplane of conventional proportions. The effects of friction in the control system are investigated and discussed. If the ailerons tend to trail with the wind, the condition for stable variation of stick force with aileron deflection is found to determine the amount of aerodynamic balance that may be used. If the ailerons tend to float against the wind, the period and damping of the rolling oscillations are found to be satisfactory (in a mass-balanced system) so long as the restoring moment is not completely balanced out. Unbalanced mass behind the hinge, however, has an unfavorable effect on the damping of the oscillations and so shifts the boundary that close aerodynamic balance may not be attainable...|$|R
40|$|A. Statement of the Thesis Problem: When the {{aerodynamic}} forces {{acting on}} a model are transmitted through struts, stings, etc. to the wind tunnel rigging for determination there are several corrections {{to be made to}} compensate for the various other forces which have unavoidably entered into the rigging. Among these are the tare corrections for the deflection of the model supports. These corrections were satisfactorily made in the case of slow speed aircraft in which the tare drag is small in comparison with the drag of the airplane. However, the performance of the new jet airplanes and missiles with extremely low drag and high speed, approaching the speed of sound and higher, cannot be satisfactorily evaluated using the same balance system. A balance system to give satisfactory data on the aerodynamic forces acting on these low drag high speed airplanes should measure only the forces acting on the model with every high degree of accuracy. This can best be achieved through use of an internal balance system. Among the many advantages which can be realized through use of a balance system which can be placed inside a model are: (a) The above mentioned corrections can be eliminated, (b) The balance system can be designed for the loads acting on the model alone, thereby increasing the sensitivity and accuracy, (c) The complexity of the wind tunnel rigging can be reduced and, (d) The electrical sensing of all the measured components simultaneously permits their direct automatic recording, thereby saving time and reducing personnel requirements. It is the purpose of this thesis to describe a small internal balance system which has been designed to measure the six aerodynamic forces and moments which act on a model being tested and thereby realizing the above mentioned advantages. B. Survey of the Field: Internal balance systems for measuring three or four of the aerodynamic forces and moments have been used for several years. These balances, in general, have been large in size thus restricting their use to large size models. Furthermore, galling of bearing surfaces and internal friction has in many cases reduced their load capacity and accuracy. During the past year the author has been able to visit the following activities for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the details of the balance systems being used: (a) The Cooperative Wind Tunnel at Pasadena, California, (b) Ames Laboratory of NACA at Moffett Field, California, (c) North American Aviation Inc., at Inglewood, California. The Cooperative Wind Tunnel has three internal strain gage balance systems of the beam type. Two of these balances measure lift, drag and pitching moment while the third also measures <b>rolling</b> moment. These <b>balances</b> are large in size. A fourth balance system in use at the Cooperative Wind Tunnel, while not of the internal type, is of particular interest. This is the transonic bump balance to which the half model is secured for testing. This balance is also of the beam type and measures all six aerodynamic forces and moments. Ames Laboratory 1 x 3 foot supersonic wind tunnel uses a four component beam type strain gage balance system in which all the beams are located in the sting and shielded from the airstream by a two inch diameter shield. The features of this balance are: (a) Use of ball bearings in races for transmitting the load to the beams, (b) Drag and rolling moment beams are readily interchangeable and, (c) The electrical system is set up to record all readings simultaneously by punching a single button. North American Aviation, Inc. has developed a small six component internal strain gage balance system for use in their new supersonic wind tunnel. This gage is being used satisfactorily. It is fully described in ref. (a). Due to the rapid lapse of time and after a conference with Mr. Bell and Mr. Gayman of the Cooperative Wind Tunnel it was decided that an internal strain gage balance system based on the North American design promised the quickest and most satisfactory solution of the design problem at hand. This met with the approval of Drs. Sechler and Klein...|$|R
