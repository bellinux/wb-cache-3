40|$|Purpose: To {{ascertain}} {{whether and how}} <b>recontacting</b> occurs in the United Kingdom. Method: A Web-based survey was administered online between October 2014 and July 2015. A link to the survey was circulated via an e-mail invitation to the clinical leads of the United Kingdom’s 23 clinical genetics services, with follow-up with senior clinical genetics staff. Results: The majority of UK services reported that they recontact patients and their family members. However, <b>recontacting</b> generally occurs in an ad hoc fashion when an unplanned event causes clinicians to review a file (a “trigger”). There are no standardized <b>recontacting</b> practices in the United Kingdom. More {{than half of the}} services were unsure whether formalized <b>recontacting</b> systems should be implemented. Some suggested greater patient involvement in the process of <b>recontacting.</b> Conclusion: This research suggests that a thorough evaluation of the efficacy and sustainability of potential <b>recontacting</b> systems within the National Health Service would be necessary before deciding whether and how to implement such a service or to create guidelines on best-practice models...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Springer Nature via the DOI in this record. This paper explores the views and expectations of patients concerning <b>recontacting</b> in clinical practice. It is based on 41 semi-structured interviews conducted in the UK. The sample comprised patients or parents of patients: without a diagnosis; recently offered a test for a condition or carrier risk; with a rare condition; with a Variant of Unknown Significance (VUS) – {{some of whom had}} been recontacted. Participants were recruited both via the National Health Service (NHS) and through online, condition-specific support groups. Most respondents viewed <b>recontacting</b> as desirable, however there were different opinions and expectations about what type of new information should trigger <b>recontacting.</b> An awareness of the potential psychological impact of receiving new information led some to suggest that <b>recontacting</b> should be planned, and tailored {{to the nature of the}} new information and the specific situation of patients and families. The lack of clarity about lines of responsibility for <b>recontacting</b> and perceptions of resource constraints in the NHS tended to mitigate respondents’ favorable positions towards <b>recontacting</b> and their preferences. Some respondents argued that <b>recontacting</b> could have a preventative value and reduce the cost of healthcare. Others challenged the idea that resources should be used to implement formalized <b>recontacting</b> systems – via arguments that there are ‘more pressing’ public health priorities, and for the need for healthcare services to offer care to new patients.

40|$|Background: Advances {{in medical}} {{genetics}} are occurring at an exponential rate. There {{is an ongoing}} discussion whether genetic counselors should <b>recontact</b> former patients regarding updated genetic information. Little information {{is available on the}} implications of this practice, {{from the point of view}} of former patients. Aim: To investigate preferences for <b>recontact</b> with the genetic clinic, in a sample of patients tested for BRCA mutations. Further investigate whether mutation status (positive/negative), type of genetic test (predictive/diagnostic) and having high information seeking coping style (monitoring) impact preferences. Knowledge from the study may be useful to achieve better communication with patients regarding <b>recontact.</b> Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were sent to 500 randomly selected patients who were previously tested for BRCA mutations between the years 2001 and 2014 at a genetic clinic in Norway. We received 280 completed questionnaires. Preferences for <b>recontact</b> were assessed with a self-constructed questionnaire, and the Threatening Situations Inventory (TMSI) was used to measure monitoring coping style. Results: Most respondents wanted the genetic counselor/geneticist to <b>recontact</b> them with advances in genetic medicine. They preferred to receive highly personalized updates. Genetic counselors/geneticists were believed most responsible for <b>recontact.</b> When comparing responses based on test result, type of test and high/low monitoring coping style, some, but few differences were found. The findings indicated a tendency for high monitors to prefer more detailed and personalized information. Conclusion: Patients have a high interest in being <b>recontacted</b> to receive updated genetic information. Receiving information relevant to own health and to receive information relevant to their own or relative's cancer risk were main reasons for wanting <b>recontact.</b> Findings indicate that type of genetic test, test result and having a high or low monitoring coping style is of minor significance for preferences.

40|$|Purpose: With rapid {{advances}} in genetic technologies, new genetic information becomes available much faster today {{than just a}} few years ago. This has raised questions about whether clinicians have a duty to recontact eligible patients when new genetic information becomes available and, if such duties exist, how they might be implemented in practice. Methods: We report the results of a systematic literature search on the ethical, legal, social (including psychological), and practical issues involved in <b>recontacting</b> former patients who received genetic services. We identified 1, 428 articles, of which 61 are covered in this review. Results: The empirical evidence available indicates that most but not all patients value being recontacted. A minority of (older) articles conclude that <b>recontacting</b> should be a legal duty. Most authors consider <b>recontacting</b> to be ethically desirable but practically unfeasible. Various solutions to overcome these practical barriers have been proposed, involving efforts of laboratories, clinicians, and patients. Conclusion: To advance the discussion on implementing <b>recontacting</b> in clinical genetics, we suggest focusing on the question of in what situations <b>recontacting</b> might be regarded as good standard of care. To this end, reaching a professional consensus, obtaining more extensive empirical evidence, and developing professional guidelines are important...|$|E
40|$|Advances in {{genomics}} {{often lead}} healthcare professionals (HCPs) {{to learn new}} information, e. g., about reinterpreted variants that could have clinical significance for patients seen previously. A question arises of whether HCPs should recontact these former patients. We present some findings interrogating the views of patients (or parents of patients) with a rare or undiagnosed condition about how such <b>recontacting</b> might be organised ethically and practically. Forty-one interviews were analysed thematically. Participants suggested a 'joint venture' model in which efforts to recontact are shared with HCPs. Some proposed an ICT-approach involving an electronic health record that automatically alerts them to potentially relevant updates. The need for rigorous privacy controls and transparency about who could access their data was emphasised. Importantly, these findings highlight {{that the lack of}} clarity about <b>recontacting</b> is a symptom of a wider problem: the lack of necessary infrastructure to pool genomic data responsibly, to aggregate it with other health data, and to enable patients/parents to receive updates. We hope that our findings will instigate a debate about the way responsibilities for <b>recontacting</b> under any joint venture model could be allocated, as well as the limitations and normative implications of using ICT as a solution to this intractable problem. As a first step to delineating responsibilities in the clinical setting, we suggest HCPs should routinely discuss <b>recontacting</b> with patients/parents, including the new information that should trigger a HCP to initiate recontact, as part of the consent process for genetic testing...|$|E

40|$|The term "duty to recontact" {{refers to}} the {{possible}} ethical and/or legal obligation of genetics service providers (GSPs) to recontact former patients about advances in research that might be relevant to them. Although currently this practice {{is not part of}} standard care, some argue that such an obligation may be established in the future. Little information is available, however, on the implications of this requirement, {{from the point of view}} of GSPs. To explore the opinions of genetics professionals on this issue, we sent a self-administered questionnaire to 1, 000 randomly selected U. S. and Canadian members of the American Society of Human Genetics. We received 252 completed questionnaires. The major categories of respondents were physician geneticist (41 %), Ph. D. geneticist (30 %), and genetic counselor (18 %); 72 % of the total stated that they see patients. Respondents indicated that responsibility for staying in contact should be shared between health professionals and patients. Respondents were divided about whether <b>recontacting</b> patients should be the standard of care: 46 % answered yes, 43 % answered no, and 11 % did not know. Those answering yes included 44 % of physician geneticists, 53 % of Ph.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the growing number}} of inmates with a mental illness in correctional facilities in Canada which continues to attract public attention and concern. Several explanations have been put forward to explain the {{rise in the number of}} inmates with a mental illness. These include: the deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill that began in the 1970 ’s, lack of treatment availability for those released into the community, and criminalization of persons with a mental illness by the justice system. The increasing numbers of persons with a mental illness in the correctional system has led to serious concerns about the capacity of this system to manage, treat, and rehabilitate individuals with a mental illness. Lack of proper treatment, management, rehabilitation and monitored discharge means that inmates with serious mental illness are more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system more frequently. 	 This thesis examines the incidence seriously mentally ill offenders and their propensity to <b>recontact.</b> Three hundred and ninety eight face-to-face assessments were conducted using the Resident Assessment Instrument-Mental Health 2. 0 (RAI-MH) and from total scores from the Level of Service Inventory Ontario Revision (LSI-OR). These assessments were conducted in 14 Ontario Provincial Correctional facilities during the years 2005 - 2008. Bivariate and multivariate regression analysis was conducted to assess <b>recontact</b> rates for serious mentally disordered and non-mentally disordered offenders. 	 With regards to <b>recontact,</b> no differences were revealed between the seriously mentally ill offender and non-mentally ill offender. This null finding on <b>recontact</b> is very surprising given the current literature on the seriously mentally ill. An additional finding revealed that for offenders with or without a serious mental illness, having a higher score on the scale of criminogenic tendencies (LSI-OR) increased rates for <b>recontact.</b> Another surprising finding is that seriously mentally ill offenders were more likely to commit minor crimes upon release, rather than violent crimes as current literature suggests. A more accurate research tool, as well as a larger sample size, will be required to assess the validity of these results. The implications of the negative outcome with respect to <b>recontact</b> and issues of identifiable risk factors for recidivism for both seriously mentally ill and non-mentally ill inmate populations are discussed in relation to outcomes in terms of both improvements to Corrections policy and theories of criminology. It is important to continue research in this area, to determine the true gravity of the incidence and <b>recontact</b> rates of mentally ill offenders. ...|$|R

40|$|The twin Mars Exploration Rover {{missions}} landed successfully on Mars {{surface in}} January of 2004.

This analysis was used to choose a proper heat shield ballast mass to ensure successful separation with low probability of recontact.

40|$|Objective One of {{the main}} goals of health {{examination}} surveys is to provide unbiased estimates of health indicators at the population level. We demonstrate how multiple imputation methods may help to reduce the selection bias if partial data on some nonparticipants are collected. Study Design and Setting In the FINRISK 2007 study, a population-based health study conducted in Finland, {{a random sample of}} 10, 000 men and women aged 25 – 74 years were invited to participate. The study included a questionnaire data collection and a health examination. A total of 6, 255 individuals participated in the study. Out of 3, 745 nonparticipants, 473 returned a simplified questionnaire after a <b>recontact.</b> Both the participants and the nonparticipants were followed up for death and hospitalizations. The follow-up data allowed to check the assumptions on the missing data mechanism, and tailored multiple imputation methods were used to handle the missing data. Results Nonparticipation is a strong predictor for mortality in the five-year follow-up. However, the <b>recontact</b> response does not predict mortality or morbidity among the nonparticipants when adjusted for age and sex. The result suggests that the <b>recontact</b> respondents can be used as proxy for all nonparticipants. A comparison of raw estimates and estimates adjusted for selection bias reveals clear differences in the estimated population prevalences of smoking and heavy alcohol usage. Conclusion All efforts to collect data on nonparticipants are likely to be useful even if the response rate for the <b>recontact</b> remains low. Statistical analysis of the <b>recontact</b> respondents provides an indication of the extent of the selection bias, even in studies where follow-up data are not available to check the assumptions...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to review the {{national}} regulations and practices of genetic counselling in 38 European countries, and to examine how well they intersect the ideals of genetic counselling defined in international guidelines. Using an electronic survey, representatives of the National Societies of Human Genetics in 29 countries, and appropriate contact persons for the field of genetic counselling in 9 other countries, were asked about the regulations and practices. The answers showed that consent, confidentiality, genetic counselling in the context of prenatal diagnosis, those professionals who may perform genetic counselling, and non-directiveness were the topics most often either agreed upon among professionals or regulated in those countries. These are also among the key aspects of ideal genetic counselling, based on international guidelines. Counselling in the context of susceptibility testing for multifactorial diseases, counselling people from ethnic minorities and <b>recontacting</b> the counsellees, on the contrary, were topics regulated or guided by generally applied practices in only few countries.

40|$|The rapidly declining {{costs and}} {{increasing}} speeds of whole-genome analysis mean that genetic testing {{is undergoing a}} shift from targeted approaches to broader ones that look at the entire genome. As whole-genome technologies gain widespread use, questions about the management of so-called incidental findings-those unrelated to the question being asked-need urgent consideration. In this review, we bring together current understanding and arguments about (1) appropriate terminology, (2) the determination of clinical utility and when to disclose incidental findings, (3) the differences in management and disclosure in clinical, research and commercial contexts and (4) ethical and practical issues about familial implications and <b>recontacting</b> those tested. We recommend that greater international consensus is developed around the disclosure and management of incidental findings, with particular attention to when, and how, less clear-cut results should be communicated. We {{suggest that there is}} no single term that captures all the issues around these kinds of findings and that different terms may, therefore, need to be used in different settings. We also encourage the use of clear consent processes, but suggest that the absence of consent should not always preclude disclosure. Finally, we recommend further research to identify ways to implement the use of a genome output as a resource, accessible over time, to facilitate appropriate disclosure and recontact when the significance of a previously unclear incidental finding is clarified...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objectives: This study {{explains}} how behavior genetic analysis using a twin design {{can help us}} assess the validity of our measures. Methods: We test multiple indicators of response propensity, a measure used by survey researchers {{to better understand the}} similarities and differences between survey respondents and nonrespondents. The response propensity indicators evaluated include response to follow-up surveys and subsequent waves of a panel and the completion of sensitive <b>recontact</b> information sheet to aid subsequent <b>recontact</b> efforts. Results: A classical and the newly proposed method of validation all point to insufficient validity of our response propensity measures. Construct validation using data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States exhibited little correlation between indicators. Genetic analysis suggests that the success of subsequent data collection efforts are predominantly driven by additive genetic effects, while nonresponse to inquiries for <b>recontact</b> information is influenced predominantly by familial environmental predictors.

In this light, a necessary reexamination of the ethical and legal structures framing research could lead to requisite changes in informed consent modalities. This would have implications for Institutional Review Boards (IRBs), who bear the responsibility of guaranteeing that participants are verifiably informed, and in sufficient detail, to understand the reality of genetic research as it is practiced now. Current literature allowed the identification of key emergent themes related to the consent process when NGS was used in a research setting.

The study commenced in March 2004 {{and evaluation of}} the clinic was conducted over 17 months from March 2005 {{to the end of}} July 2006. A total of 612 patients had telephone consultations during this time, 228 of whom were referred from primary care with a median of 30 patients counselled per month (range of 19 – 63, depending on staff availability with average of two staff per clinic). Waiting times were measured for General Practitioner referrals and all 228 were counselled within the national target-stipulated 13 weeks (median 6 weeks, range 1 – 12). An additional 132 patients who were sent appointment letters after receipt of their family history questionnaires did not attend their appointments (18 % of all potential referrals) and required <b>recontacting</b> by letter. After telephone counselling, 42 % of patients were able to be discharged from the telephone clinic without a subsequent face-to-face appointment, thereby saving resources. The telephone clinic also had a short set-up time with flexibility on timing and day of administration, which would be an advantage in centres where outreach clinic facilities are scarce.

40|$|Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) {{technology}} {{allows us}} to create self-organising and scalable systems. The distributed nature of these systems requires a solution for finding interesting peers. In the context of P 2 P file sharing, finding peers who are downloading the same file {{is referred to as}} the swarm discovery problem. In BitTorrent, this problem is solved using a central server, called a tracker. This central component hinders the scalability of BitTorrent. We have designed a distributed swarm discovery algorithm, called 2 -Hop TorrentSmell. It is composed of two parts. The first part builds on top of an existing keyword search system to find peers who have recently downloaded a certain file. The second part consists of an algorithm called RePEX, which allows a peer to stay in touch with swarms it is no longer in by periodically <b>recontacting</b> previously encountered swarm members. Our RePEX algorithm leverages a widely used BitTorrent extension for swarm discovery called PEX. We have conducted a study to understand the reliability and usability of PEX to optimize the design of our solution. We have implemented the RePEX part of 2 -Hop TorrentSmell as an addition to the Tribler P 2 P network. For the evaluation of our RePEX algorithm, we have tested it on the 10 largest swarms on a public tracker. In addition, we have deployed the algorithm in a beta version of Tribler and let it run on swarms the user has downloaded from.
