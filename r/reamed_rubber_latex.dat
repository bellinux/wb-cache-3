40|$|In {{addition}} to immediate type I allergy symptoms, natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> allergy may manifest as protein contact dermatitis on {{the hands of}} health-care workers and other natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> glove users. We examined whether repeated application of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> on mouse skin causes sensitization to natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> and dermatitis. Epicutaneous sensitization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> produced a significant influx of mononuclear cells, CD 4 + CD 3 + cells, and eosinophils to the sensitized skin sites. The number of degranulated mast cells in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites was significantly higher compared with control sites treated with phosphate-buffered saline. The expression of interleukin- 1 β and interleukin- 4 mRNA was markedly increased in natural rubber latex-sensitized skin sites. Moreover, significant increases in the mRNA expression of chemokines CCL 2 (monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1), CCL 11 (eotaxin- 1), CCL 3 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 α), and CCL 4 (macrophage inflammatory protein- 1 β) were found. In {{addition to}} the cutaneous inflammatory response, epicutaneous sensitization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induced a striking increase in the total and specific immunoglobulin E levels {{but not in the}} immunoglobulin G 2 a levels. Intraperitoneal immunization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induced a strong natural rubber latex-specific immunoglobulin G 2 a response, but only a weak immunoglobulin E response. We also studied the role of two major natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> allergens, the highly hydrophilic prohevein and the hydrophobic rubber elongation factor. Cutaneous application of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> elicited a strong immunoglobulin E response against prohevein, but not against rubber elongation factor. On the contrary, intraperitoneal immunization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> elicited strong immunoglobulin G 2 a production to rubber elongation factor but not to prohevein. These results demonstrate that epicutaneous sensitization with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induces T helper 2 -dominated dermal inflammation and strong immunoglobulin E response in this murine model of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> induced protein contact dermatitis.

Cassava peel is a waste, containing cellulose which is potential as fillers in natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> products. Cassava peel waste was dried and milled until the size of 100 mesh. Alkanolamide is one type of non-ionic surfactant which is synthesized from RBDPS (Refined Bleached Deodorized Palm Stearin) and diethanolamine.

40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to {{evaluate}} natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> - filler interaction. 1800 - peel test of flexible to rigid joints was performed to determine the peel strength of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> -kaolin joints in order to evaluate the interaction of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> with standard <b>rubber</b> grade kaolin and activated one by ion exchange reaction with amino -functional derivatives. Experimented natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> compounds were pre vulcanized with sulphur and ionization radiation. Radiation vulcanization was performed using 60 Co source irradiator, originally designed for sterilization of medical products, with reduced gamma rays dose rate. Its suitability for radiation vulcanization of locally produced natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> was confirmed experimentally. Obtained results showed that the peel off test device was acceptable for evaluation of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> -filler interaction irrespective of the vulcanization system used with latex compound. Peel test results displayed the influence of modified fillers on the peel strength values of tested laminates. Increased peel strength values of the samples containing modified kaolin were attributed to better interaction of the filler with rubber polymer. It was investigated, that facilitated interaction observed with natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> and modified kaolin resulted in improved properties of filled natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> compounds of both vulcanization system, and irradiated one was more susceptible within the experiment performed. Preference in mechanical stability time, viscosity factor and tensile was given to radiation vulcanization natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> (RVNRL). Reinforcing effect of modified filers in natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> compounds was lower of that observed earlier with dry rubber compounds. The reason for it could be associated with partial deactivation of the active centres initially brought by modification the phenomenon that have to be studied and overcome in the future. However, it is hoped that carried out research positively contributes to the understanding the mechanism of reinforcement of rubber polymers with fillers and development of the technologies upgrading cheap local mineral resources to use them more beneficially in natural rubber formulation technology.

The grafting reaction was carried out using emulsion polymerization at 60 °C. Potassium persulfate was used to initiate polymerization. Four different weight percentage ratios of BA to MMA used in this work were 95 : 5, 90 : 10, 85 : 15 and 80 : 20. Percentage conversion of the monomer of all latexes prepared was ≥ 79. 5 %. The grafting efficiency of graft-modified natural rubber with a different monomer ratio tends to decrease with an increase of MMA. 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H-NMR) confirmed that the latexes which were prepared contained graft copolymer. The adhesive performance was characterized by 90 ° peel strength tests. Only graft-modified natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> with the monomer ratio of 80 : 20 possessed an adhesion property enough to conduct peel testing.

In sulphur-vulcanized natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> films, the crosslinked regions appeared as dark areas within the elliptical shaped rubber particles and as strands around the rubber particles section in between rubber particles linking the rubber particles. In peroxide-vulcanized natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> films, crosslinks region appeared denser at the outer surface of the rubber particles compared to the inner phase. Hydroxyacetone has been shown as an effective activator for tert-buthyl hydroperoxide in the prevulcanization of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> using peroxide process. The maximum tensile strength value was observed to occur at film prepared at a prevulcanization temperature of 60 °C, heating for 3 hours. The drying time and temperature {{play an important role}} in controlling the strength property of peroxide-vulcanized natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> films. Crosslink density is not the only factor that contributes to high strength property of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> films. The addition of higher levels of crosslinking agent resulting in higher crosslink density and modulus of elasticity values, but, too high crosslinking may lead to subsequent decreased in the tensile strength value. Thus, a combination of the right degree of crosslinking range and the degree of particle cohesion are important factors governing the strength of natural <b>rubber</b> <b>latex</b> films. Leaching treatment and drying at elevated temperature, improved the coalescence of the rubber particles which in turn improved the tensile strength of the films. The addition of antioxidant hinders the thermal-oxidative effect during the drying process and thus, greater coherence of the films by heat treatment could be obtained...|$|R
