40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to survey doctors working in {{psychiatry}} in Australia about the practice of using two antidepressants simultaneously. Method: A postal survey was sent to all doctors in psychiatry in Australia enquiring about their prescribing history and their attitudes to combination antidepressants and related issues. Results: Seventy-nine percent of respondents had used combination antidepressants. The most frequently reported combination was a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor combined with a tricyclic antidepressant. Combinations of mirtazepine with venlafaxine and other antidepressants were the next most frequently used. Seventeen percent of respondents reported having seen a complication from combination antidepressants, 75 % believed that Australian GPs should be given information on the use of combination antidepressants, 89 % wished for more information on this topic, and 88 % believed patients had a right to be informed of this option in their treatment.

40|$|Hypertension in {{children}} is common, and {{the prevalence of}} primary hypertension is increasing with the obesity epidemic and changing dietary choices. Careful measurement of blood pressure is important to correctly diagnose hypertension, as many factors can lead to inaccurate blood pressure measurement. Hypertension is diagnosed based on comparison of age-, sex-, and height-based norms with the average systolic and diastolic blood pressures on three separate occasions. In the absence of hypertensive target organ damage (TOD), stage I hypertension is managed first by diet and exercise, {{with the addition of}} drug therapy if this fails. First-line treatment of stage I hypertension with TOD and stage II hypertension includes both lifestyle changes and medications. First-line agents include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thiazide diuretics, and calcium-channel blockers. Hypertensive emergency with end-organ effects requires immediate modest blood pressure reduction to alleviate symptoms. This is usually accomplished with IV medications. Long-term reduction in blood pressure to normal levels is accomplished gradually. Specific medication choice for outpatient hypertension management is determined by the underlying cause of hypertension and the comparative adverse effect profiles, along with practical considerations such as cost and frequency of administration. Antihypertensive medication is initiated at a starting dose and can be gradually increased to effect. If ineffective at the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose,</b> an additional medication with a complementary mechanism of action can be added...|$|E
30|$|Hydroxyethyl starch (HES) based colloids {{have gained}} {{popularity}} in clinical anesthesia practice {{due to their}} effective intravascular volume expansion (Kozek-Langenecker 2005). Recently, there have been studies warning providers to limit the volume infused because of concerns for platelet dysfunction and increased bleeding (Kozek-Langenecker 2005; Westphal et al. 2009; Myburgh and Mythen 2013; Hartog et al. 2011), based on in vitro coagulation abnormalities (Avorn et al. 2003; Wilkes et al. 2001; Strauss 1981). For example, in a porcine model of liver trauma HES {{has been shown to}} provoke uncontrolled hemorrhage (Zaar et al. 2009). Similarly, in a small prospective randomized trial of 40 patients undergoing major surgery the impact of HES on coagulation was apparent, as HES reduced clot strength and increased perioperative hemorrhage by more than 50 % (Rasmussen et al. 2014). Even when used at less than the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose,</b> HES use has been associated with increased postoperative bleeding and transfusion in patients undergoing heart surgery requiring cardiac bypass (Avorn et al. 2003; Wilkes et al. 2001). There have also have been small studies associating the use of HES with intracranial bleeding and coagulopathy in the setting of subarachnoid hemorrhage (Damon et al. 1987; Knutson et al. 2000). The mechanisms causing this acquired coagulopathy include qualitative platelet dysfunction, decreases in Factor VIII/von Willebrand’s factor complexes (sometimes referred to as “Acquired von Willebrand’s disease-Type 1 ”), and qualitative disruption of fibrin clots (Trumble et al. 1995; Jonville-Bera et al. 2001).|$|E
40|$|Background: The regular use {{of simple}} analgesics in {{addition}} to opioids such as paracetamol (or acetaminophen) is recommended for persistent pain to enhance analgesia. Few {{studies have examined the}} frequency and doses of paracetamol among people with chronic non-cancer pain including use above the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> daily <b>dose.</b> Aims: To assess (i) the prevalence of paracetamol use among people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids, (ii) assess the prevalence of paracetamol use above the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> daily <b>dose</b> and (iii) assess correlates of people who used paracetamol above the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> daily <b>dose</b> including: age, gender, income, education, pain severity and interference, use of paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics, total opioid dose, depression, anxiety, pain self-efficacy or comorbid substance use, among people prescribed opioids for chronic non-cancer pain. Methods: This study draws on baseline data collected for the Pain and Opioids IN Treatment (POINT) study and utilises data from 962 interviews and medication diaries. The POINT study is national prospective cohort of people with chronic non-cancer pain prescribed opioids. Participants were recruited from randomly selected pharmacies across Australia. Results: Sixty-three per cent of the participants had used paracetamol in the past week (95 % CI = 59. 7 - 65. 8). Among the paracetamol users 22 % (95 % CI = 19. 3 - 24. 6) had used paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics and 4. 8 % (95 % CI = 3. 6 - 6. 3) had used paracetamol above the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> daily <b>dose</b> (i. e. > 4000 mg/day). Following binomial logistic regression (chi(2) = 25. 98, df = 10, p = 0. 004), people who had taken above the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> daily <b>dose</b> were less likely to have low income (AOR = 0. 52, 95 % CI = 0. 27 - 0. 99), more likely to use paracetamol/opioid combination analgesics (AOR = 2. 01, 95 % CI = 1. 02 - 3. 98) and more likely to take a higher opioid dose (AOR = 1. 00, 95 % CI = 1. 00 - 1. 01).

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} key {{motivators}} behind selection of analgesics (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), paracetamol and complementary medications (CMs)) by patients with osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: A qualitative study, in which in-depth semi-structured {{interviews were conducted}} with 15 OA patients, recruited from four general practices in Sydney, Australia. Patients were aged 65 or above, and were currently taking, or had recently taken, an NSAID for osteoarthritis. Results: Three key themes emerged from the data: reliance, routine and pill load. Reliance: Patients were strongly reliant upon NSAIDs because they consistently satisfied their needs. By contrast, they were much less reliant upon paracetamol because of uncertainty or scepticism about its effectiveness. They were not reliant upon CMs but were willing to take them indefinitely because they were perceived as being without risk. Routine and pill load: Many patients took an NSAID, as well as CMs as part of a ‘daily routine’. By contrast, patients had difficulty developing a routine around using paracetamol at the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> because of the implicit frequency of dosing required and an aversion to the associated ‘pill load’. Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of exploring the perceptions and preferences of patients with regard to analgesics for OA. Clinician advice regarding analgesia for OA should take account of the possible reliance of the patient upon an NSAID, their medicine routines, and their potential concern about the pill load associated, in particular, with paracetamol.

40|$|Pyrimorph {{is a novel}} {{fungicide}} {{with high}} activity against the plant pathogen Phytophthora capsici. We investigated the risk that P. capsici can develop resistance to pyrimorph. The baseline sensitivities of 226 P. capsici isolates, tested by mycelial growth inhibition, showed a unimodal distribution with a mean EC 50 value of 1. 4261 (60. 4002) mg/ml. Twelve pyrimorph-resistant mutants were obtained by repeated exposure to pyrimorph in vitro with a frequency of approximately 161024. The resistance factors of the mutants ranged from 10. 67 to 56. 02. Pyrimorph resistance of the mutants was stable after 10 transfers on pyrimorph-free medium. Fitness in sporulation, cystospore germination, and pathogenicity in the pyrimorph-resistant mutants was similar to or less than that in the parental wild-type isolates. On detached pepper leaves and pepper plants treated with the <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> of pyrimorph, however, virulence was greater for mutants {{with a high level}} of pyrimorph resistance than for the wild type. The results suggest that the risk of P. capsici developing resistance to pyrimorph is low to moderate. Among mutants {{with a high level of}} pyrimorph resistance, EC 50 values for pyrimorph and CAA fungicides flumorph, dimethomorph, and mandipropamid were positively correlated. This indicated that point mutations in cellulose synthase 3 (CesA 3) may confer resistance to pyrimorph. Comparison of CesA 3 in isolates with a high level of pyrimorph resistance and parental isolates showed that an amino acid change from glutamine to lysine at position 1077 resulted in stable, high resistance in the mutants.

40|$|ABSTRACT Resistance to {{herbicides}} is {{a serious}} threat to crop production worldwide, especially in agronomic crops and cereals. This research evaluated the possible occurrence of Bidens pilosa resistant to imazethapyr and atrazine in Brazil. The resistant biotype was collected from an area with a history of repeated application of photosystem II (PSII) and ALS inhibitor herbicides. The susceptible biotype was collected from an area with no history of herbicide application. Resistance verification experiments were carried out in the greenhouse. The treatments were arranged in a 3 x 8 factorial scheme, where the first factor was populations [susceptible (S), parent resistant (PR), and resistant F 1 (RF 1) ]; and the second factor was herbicide dose (0, 375, 750, 1500, 3000, 6000, 12000 and 24000 g ha- 1 for atrazine; or 0, 12. 5, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 g ha- 1 for imazethapyr). The resistance factor to atrazine was 2. 83 for PR and 5. 55 for RF 1. This population was more resistant to imazethapyr (> 21 -fold) than it was to atrazine. The <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> of the herbicides did not control this B. pilosa population adequately.

40|$|Introduction: Erectile {{dysfunction}} has {{usually been}} treated by a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor in men, {{especially in the}} past decade. Although sildenafil and vardenafil are widely used, {{there is a high}} percentage of people who do not respond to these drugs. This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of the lastly presented phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, tadalafil, in nonresponder group of patients to sildenafil and vardenafil. Materials and Methods: Forty married men with erectile dysfunction who had taken sildenafil or vardenafil at the maximum recommended doses and had not responded to the treatment were included. They were treated with tadalafil, 20 mg, at least 4 doses at different days. The effectiveness of the treatment was reviewed by different questionnaires, including the International Index of Erectile Function- 5 (IIEF- 5), Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) questions 2 and 3, and the Global Assessment Question (GAQ), {{at the end of the}} 12 th week. Results: The IIEF- 5 scores were 11. 90 ± 4. 78 and 12. 67 ± 6. 70, before and after at least 4 doses of tadalafil, respectively (P =. 30). The rate of positive responses to SEP 2, SEP 3, and GAQ questions were also insignificantly different after the treatment. During this period, flushing was seen in 10 and headache was seen in 5 patients. Conclusion: The <b>recommended</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> for tadalafil insignificantly improved the IIEF 5, SEP 2, SEP 3, and GAQ scores in patients with erectile dysfunction who had not responded to sildenafil and vardenafil.

The investigations have resulted in a number of significant findings: - The anatomical evidence in combination with the pattern of visual field loss suggests that the damage induced by VGB therapy occurs at retinal level, and is most likely a toxic effect. - The quantitative algorithm, designed within the course of this investigation, provided increased sensitivity in determining the severity of visual field loss. - Maximum VGB dose predisposes patients to develop severe visual field loss. - The SITA Standard algorithm was found to be as sensitive and significantly faster, in diagnosing visual field defects attributed to VGB, when compared to the Full Threshold algorithm. The Full Threshold was found to be the most repeatable between visits. - The normal SWAP 10 - 2 database provided an effective method of differentiating SWAP defects. - SWAP, FDT and the mfERG have increased sensitivity in detecting visual field loss attributed to VGB.

Efficacy was also assessed by nitroglycerin consumption per week and the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ). Adjustment for multiple testing of secondary end points used a hierarchic closed testing procedure. Efficacy was assessed in subgroups based on baseline angina frequency, concomitant long-acting nitrate use, gender, and age. Safety was assessed by adverse events and electrocardiogram evaluations. A total of 565 patients were randomized: 281 patients to ranolazine and 284 patients t...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} chronic {{administration}} of (a) 1600 mg. meprobamate, (b) five Tranquil tablets (the <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> daily <b>dose),</b> and (c) placebos were examined, in a counterbalanced partially blinded design. Thirty-two subjects, including 23 anxious patients, employed {{as their own}} controls, were given behavioral tests, psychiatric interviews, and ratings {{at the end of}} each 21 day treatment period...|$|R
50|$|After {{inhalation}} of doses up to 800 μg (twice the <b>maximum</b> <b>recommended</b> <b>dose)</b> systemic {{blood levels}} of pirbuterol are below the limit of assay sensitivity (2-5 ng/ml). A mean of 51% of the dose is recovered in urine as pirbuterol plus its sulfate conjugate following administration by aerosol. Pirbuterol is not metabolized by catechol-O-methyltransferase. The plasma half-life measured after oral administration is about two hours.|$|R

No selection of the mcr- 1 -positive strain was observed in our controlled conditions whatever the dose. Further investigations in real farming conditions seem necessary...|$|R
50|$|In Europe, {{sertindole}} {{was approved}} and marketed in 19 countries from 1996, but its marketing authorization was suspended by the European Medicines Agency in 1998 {{and the drug}} was withdrawn from the market. In 2002, based on new data, the EMA's CHMP suggested that Sertindole could be reintroduced for restricted use in clinical trials, with strong safeguards including extensive contraindications and warnings for patients at risk of cardiac dysrhythmias, a <b>recommended</b> reduction in <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> from 24 mg to 20 mg in all but exceptional cases, and extensive ECG monitoring requirement before and during treatment.|$|R
40|$|Recommendations vary for renal and cardiovascular-protective {{treatment}} for type 2 diabetics with ACEi and/or ARBs – when to start, the dose and treatment goals. The HOPE study <b>recommends</b> <b>maximum</b> <b>dose</b> ACEi for all diabetics with any additional risk factor, including overweight (micro) albuminuria, high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, high cholesterol and coexisting cardiovascular disease. Other studies report little benefit with low dose ACEi, and that full dose is generally well tolerated, safe and effective, even with advanced renal insufficiency. We examined implications for Aboriginal people in remote areas, where health services are stretched, doctor visits few, and chronic disease care flows best where Health Workers can follow simple algorithms, use a limited menu of drugs, and start treatment immediately. We analysed profiles of diabetics four remote areas, shown below, with hypertension defined at ≥ 140 / 90 & at ≥ 130 / 85, in parentheses. Nearly all had additional ‘risk factors’, even with cholesterol levels and CV disease excluded. The few without will probably acquire them with age. We recommend universal ACEi/ARB {{treatment for}} diabetics, where no contraindications exist, and titration to full dose at one month for everyone without side-effects and with acceptable potassium and creatinine levels. Combination and additional therapy {{can then be}} used for BP still not at goal, which {{also needs to be}} specified uniformly. This simplifies the renal and CV-protective elements of treatment, eliminates uncertainty, reduces follow up visits, and minimises implications of failing to detect additional risk factors or complications later in their course...|$|R
