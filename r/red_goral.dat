5000|$|The <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> is a {{commonly}} hunted animal {{and is often}} killed for its body parts. Red gorals {{are one of the}} seven most valuable species that are being hunted and targeted by humans. [...] Red gorals are hunted for their meat, skin, antler, legs, and gall bladder. The meat of the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> is mostly eaten by the local human population, while the skin of the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> is then sold to outside traders. <b>Red</b> <b>goral</b> meat is valued by the hunters because they prefer to eat it when they go on their long hunting trips. [...] <b>Red</b> <b>goral</b> hunters are either locals who sell the body parts in China or traders who come from China to get the body parts themselves. The hunting of the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> contributes to its population decline because gorals only produce one offspring at a time.note the table is in US dollars, the price can be more or less depending on the currency conversion in different countries* ...|$|E

50|$|The Good Zoo is a 30 acre {{facility}} that houses over 80 species of animals. The zoo was dedicated {{in memory of}} a seven-year-old boy, Phillip Mayer Good, who loved nature. He {{was the son of}} Barbara and Larry Good of Wheeling. As of 2017, the Good Zoo's collection includes cheetahs, river otters, spectacled bears, zebras, kangaroos, wallabys, tamarins, lemurs, ostriches, llamas, goats, barn owls, bald eagles, <b>red</b> pandas, <b>gorals,</b> white-naped cranes, a small gang of meerkats and many other animals from all over the globe. It includes a train, which travels through the ostrich exhibit and all throughout the zoo, and a discovery lab, with an indoor South American rainforest exhibit. The zoo also features an aviary, which houses two subspecies of the rainbow lorikeet, the blue mountain (Swainson's) lorikeet, and the green-naped lorikeet. The Good Zoo is the only AZA accredited zoo in West Virginia.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>red</b> <b>goral,</b> Naemorhedus baileyi, inhabits {{areas from}} the Yunnan {{province}} of China, to Tibet and northeastern India through northern Myanmar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from {{other members of}} the genus Naemorhedus by its reddish coat - all other gorals are greyish-brown with grizzled hairs. The <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> is also the smallest goral, and has a greater curvature to its horns. Both males and females have a pair of short, arcing horns. The horns of males tend to be longer and thicker than those of females, but lengths of 7.5-16 cm are typical for both sexes.|$|E
50|$|A zoo was {{established}} on 14 August 1958 in the Birch Hill neighbourhood of Darjeeling under the Department of Education of the Government of West Bengal {{with a goal}} to study and preserve Himalayan fauna. Its first Director and founder was Dilip Kumar Dey. Mr. Dey, who belonged to the Indian Forest Service was on deputation to the Department of Education {{for the express purpose}} of establishing a high-altitude zoological park specializing mainly in Himalayan flora and fauna. The park's prized possessions were a pair of Siberian (Ussuri) tigers presented to the Government of India by Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in 1960. Over the years famous names in the world of Conservation have been attracted to and have visited the HZP. The zoo now contains endangered animals like snow leopards, <b>red</b> pandas, <b>gorals</b> (mountain goat), Siberian tigers and a variety of endangered birds. However, there has been concern regarding the fact that the Himalayan animals may face a threat due to rising temperatures in the hilly area.|$|R
50|$|The {{ecoregion}} {{is home to}} 149 known {{species of}} mammals. This includes two near-endemic species, a bat Pipistrellus joffrei, and a murid rodent Hadromys humei. The ecoregion is home to several endangered and threatened mammal species, including the tiger (Panthera tigris), clouded leopard (Pardofelis nebulosa), Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), Eld's deer (Cervus eldii), gaur (Bos gaurus), Himalayan <b>goral</b> (Nemorhaedus <b>goral),</b> <b>red</b> panda (Ailurus fulgens), smooth-coated otter (Lutrogale perspicillata), Indian civet (Viverra zibetha), back-striped weasel (Mustela strigidorsa), Assamese macaque (Macaca assamensis), bear macaque (Macaca arctoides), southern pig-tailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina), capped leaf monkey (Semnopithecus pileatus), and hoolock gibbon (Hylobates hoolock).|$|R
40|$|The goral is {{a stocky}} goat-like animal {{with a wide}} distribution, from the Himalayan region of India and Pakistan, to Myanmar, Thailand, South Korea, North Korea, eastern Russia and China. Taxonomists have {{recognised}} three species of gorals and some subspecies: Nemorhaedus caudatus (N. caudatus raddaneus, N. caudatus caudatus, N. caudatus griseus, N. caudatus evansii) or long-tailed goral; Nemorhaedus baileyi (N. baileyi baileyi, N. baileyi cranbrooki) or <b>red</b> goral; Nemorhaedus <b>goral</b> (N. goral bedfordi; N. goral goral) of Himalayan goral. Gorals are Bovidae included in the Tribe of Rupicaprini, or “goat antelopes”. They present intermediate characters between more primitive Rupicaprini (serows) and Caprini (goats and sheep), as for what concerns habitat preference (rocky, steep areas in mountain forest with interspersed open areas), diet (browsers with preference for grass species), social behaviour (they live in small groups and interact only during the mating season) and mating system (followers). All three species are listed as Vulnerable or Near Threatened by IUCN and included in Appendix I, CITES. Habitat loss and degradation and poaching represent the main threats. Despite the high ecological, evolutionary and cultural value, gorals have been somehow overlooked by the scientific community, as there are few published studies available. A big effort is needed to widen the knowledge on the ecology of gorals and underline their value to the publi...|$|R
50|$|Due to a {{decrease}} in the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> population, the Breeding Center of Shanghai Zoo started a breeding program to prevent extinction. The program started with seven wild red gorals and in the span of 22 years raised 27 red gorals. China is currently attempting to enforce laws on <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> hunting and restore their natural habitat. Programs like Chinese Geotourism aim to make revenue from wildlife while preserving their natural habitats, however emphasis on Chinese conservation is usually placed upon the endangered Panda.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{earliest}} recorded references to their existence was made in 1863, however {{it was not until}} 1961 that the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> was identified as its one species.|$|E
50|$|The main {{purposes}} of the park are habitat conservation. The typical habitats are tropical evergreen forest and mangroves. The main animals found in the park are Sambar Deer, Asian Elephant, Barking Deer, Serow, <b>Red</b> <b>Goral,</b> Malayan tapir, tiger, Leopard {{and a number of}} bird species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> (Naemorhedus baileyi) is {{a species}} of even-toed {{ungulate}} in the subfamily Caprinae in the family Bovidae. It is found in India, Tibet and Myanmar. Its natural habitats are seasonal mountainous areas 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level. It is threatened by habitat loss and hunting.|$|E
50|$|Other species {{include the}} sambar deer, barking deer, serow, <b>red</b> <b>goral,</b> leopard, Kitti's hog-nosed bat, the Tenasserim white-bellied rat and the Tenasserim lutung, {{as well as}} a number of bird species. Among the fishes in the streams and rivulets of the range the emperor loach and the Tenasserim garra deserve mention.|$|E
50|$|Body {{weight of}} the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> {{typically}} ranges from 20-30 kilograms. The red goral's body length can reach lengths of 100 cm. There is evidence showing that the females can reach body sizes larger than that of male red gorals, but size difference between the sexes {{is too small to}} be significant.|$|E

50|$|Version 3.1 of the IUCN {{lists the}} <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> as vulnerable. R. Harris and M. Festa-Bianchet re-assed the red gorals’ status in June 2008. The mature {{population}} of red gorals is still below 10,000 individuals, {{and there is}} still a continuing population decline due to over hunting. Therefore, the status of red gorals remained vulnerable, as it had been previously in 1996, 1990 and 1988.|$|E

50|$|The red gorals’ {{are found}} in mountainous regions in Nepal, China, Tibet, and Burma about 1,000 to 2,000 meters above sea level. Vegetation and {{habitats}} are currently being destroyed due to climate change,and excessive hunting. Traditionally the climate has been very seasonal with wet periods interspersed with dry periods, but a historically unusual dry spell has interfered with the red gorals’ ideal climate, {{making it harder for}} red gorals to reproduce. Fragmentation and forest loss have also contributed to a decrease in the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> population.|$|E

50|$|The {{largest of}} these goat {{antelope}} is the takin, {{a relative of}} the musk ox. It lives in highlands from the eastern foothills of the Himalayas to the Qinling and shares habitat with the giant panda in Sichuan and Shaanxi. The takin is a Class I protected species.Serows are smaller than takins but significantly larger than gorals. Both serows and gorals live in rainy mountainous regions and are excellent climbers. Serows have shorter and coarser wool than gorals. The mainland serow is spread across southern China. The range of the Chinese goral is even broader, extending to Korea in the northeast. The long-tailed goral lives in the northeast, along the borders with Russia and North Korea. The Himalayan serow, Himalayan goral, and <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> are found in southern Tibet. The Taiwan serow is endemic to Taiwan.|$|E
5000|$|Red gorals {{are most}} active during the day, {{and tend to}} retreat to {{inaccessible}} cliffs at night, where they sleep on sheltered ledges. They are strong climbers and jumpers, and seek safety from predators by fleeing up cliffs. The predators of the <b>red</b> <b>goral</b> are jackals and leopards. They are also very vulnerable and can easily contract Ixodes which is a tick that attacks the tissue and then sucks the gorals blood. They can clear obstacles over 1.8 m high from a standing start. Red gorals live in mountainous regions and woodlands in The People’s Republic of China and other countries near China. The goral is an animal that migrates vertically according what season it is. During the summer seasons they stay in the upper area of the forest while during the winters they migrate down to the low areas in the forest. Although generally quiet, males make a call which sounds like [...] "zer - zer" [...] during the breeding season; female red gorals also whistle as males approach. Red gorals typically inhabit a home range of around 40 hectares. Males are territorial during the breeding season. Their diets consist of lichens, grasses, stems, and leaves. Their most common food source is Usnea which {{is a type of}} lichen.|$|E
