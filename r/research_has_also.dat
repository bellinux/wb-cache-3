5|$|Latest <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{shown that}} Murray cod in fact live their entire {{lifecycle}} with{{in the main}} channel of the stream. Earlier ideas that Murray cod spawn on floodplains, or the larvae feed on floodplains, are incorrect. Murray cod breed in the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, the inundated upper portion of the main channel and tributary channels, but not on floodplains. Murray cod larvae feed within the main river channel or, in times of spring flood, on the inundated upper portion of the main channel and the channel/floodplain boundary, {{but not on the}} floodplain.|$|E
5|$|The Asiatic dayflower is {{considered}} a weed both in areas where it was introduced and {{in certain parts of}} its native range. The flowers' interactions with pollinators have been well studied and have helped to support important hypotheses about pollination in the field of plant ecology. Recent <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> revealed that the Asiatic dayflower can bioaccumulate a number of metals, making it a candidate for revegetating and essentially cleaning spoiled copper mines. Several animals and fungi use the plant as a food source, with a few species feeding upon it exclusively.|$|E

25|$|Some {{scholars}} have explained agoraphobia as an attachment deficit, i.e., the temporary {{loss of the}} ability to tolerate spatial separations from a secure base. Recent empirical <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> linked attachment and spatial theories of agoraphobia.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{shown that}} deeper-dwelling species are less {{affected}} by {{the invasion of the}} Asian date mussel. Mussel mats have no significant effect on the mortality of deeper-dwelling clam species such as Tapes decussatus and Ruditapes philippinarum.|$|E
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{been carried}} out into the {{neurology}} of bimodal bilinguals, or people who can speak one oral language and one sign language. Studies with bimodal bilinguals have also provided insight into {{the tip of the}} tongue phenomenon, working memory, and patterns of neural activity when recognizing facial expressions, signing, and speaking.|$|E

25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> found a low {{expression}} of reward dependence in suicide attempters. These findings {{and the negative}} correlation between reward dependence {{and the number of}} suicide attempts may suggest the implication of the noradrenergic pathway in suicide behaviors. Low scores of RD have also been implicated in showing criminality in adult age.|$|E
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{shown that}} {{improved}} air quality translates to decreased toxin exposure among employees. For example, among {{employees of the}} Norwegian establishments that enacted smoking restrictions, tests showed decreased levels of nicotine in the urine of both smoking and non-smoking workers (as compared with measurements prior to going smoke-free).|$|E
25|$|Other {{attempts}} to create anti-aging drugs have taken different research paths. One notable direction {{of research has}} been research into {{the possibility of using}} the enzyme telomerase in order to counter the process of telomere shortening. However, there are potential dangers in this, since some <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> linked telomerase to cancer and to tumor growth and formation.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} website cites studies, {{these studies are}} outdated, vague, relied on a very small sample size of children, were single-blind tests (which can be heavily {{influenced}} by an experimenter's bias), and conflated correlation with causation. The billboards put up by PETA promoting this <b>research</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been considered offensive by many autistic individuals.|$|R
25|$|More ecologically-friendly {{means are}} being tested as an {{alternative}} to chemical treatments. Soil steam sterilization involves injecting steam into contaminated soil in order to kill subterranean plant parts. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> been carried out on Mycosphaerella leafspot fungus, which devastates knotweed in its native Japan. This research has been relatively slow due to the complex life cycle of the fungus.|$|E
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{examined}} occupational {{stress in}} specific occupations, including police, general practitioners, and dentists. Another {{concern has been}} the relation of occupational stress to family life. Other research has examined gender differences in leadership style and job stress and strain {{in the context of}} male- and female-dominated industries, and unemployment-related distress. I/O psychology is also concerned with the relation of occupational stress to career advancement.|$|E
25|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{an important}} brain structure {{when it comes to}} learning fearful responses, in other words, it influences how people remember traumatic things. An increase in blood flow to this area has been shown when people look at scary faces, or remember traumatic events. <b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> shown that the lateral nucleus of the amygdala is a crucial site of neural changes that occur during fear conditioning.|$|E
50|$|Atopic {{dermatitis}} {{is typically}} diagnosed clinically, meaning it is diagnosed based on {{signs and symptoms}} alone, without special testing. Several different forms of criteria developed for <b>research</b> <b>have</b> <b>also</b> been validated to aid in diagnosis. Of these, the UK Diagnostic Criteria, {{based on the work}} of Hanifin and Rajka, has been the most widely validated.|$|R

More advanced statistical methods employed in I/O research include logistic regression, structural equation modeling, and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM; also known as multilevel modeling). I/O <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> employed meta-analysis. I/O psychologists also employ psychometric methods including methods associated with classical test theory, generalizability theory, and item response theory (IRT).|$|E
25|$|People {{with high}} scores on a psychopathy rating scale {{are more likely to}} engage in bullying, crime and drug use than other people. Hare and Babiak noted that about 29 per cent of {{corporate}} psychopaths are also bullies. Other <b>research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> shown that people with {{high scores on}} a psychopathy rating scale were {{more likely to engage in}} bullying, again indicating that psychopaths tend to be bullies in the workplace.|$|E
25|$|<b>Research</b> <b>has</b> <b>also</b> {{found that}} {{corporate}} social marketing, {{a form of}} CSR promoting societal good, {{is being used to}} direct criticism away from the damaging practices of the alcohol industry. It has been shown that adverts which supposedly encourage responsible drinking simultaneously aim to promote drinking as a social norm. Companies may engage in CSR and social marketing in this case to prevent more stringent government legislation on alcohol marketing.|$|E
