Materials and methodsEighty standardized four-unit FPDs of polymethyl methacry-late resin were fabricated on a metal jig and evenly divided into eight groups. The control and comparison groups were unreinforced acrylic specimens and specimens reinforced with 4 -mm steel wire, respectively. The six experimental groups comprised acrylic FPDs reinforced with 4 -, 18 -, and 30 -mm glass fiber (FibreKor) or polyethylene fiber (Construct). ResultsOne-way ANOVA results revealed statistically significant differences between the fracture loads of the experimental and control/comparison groups (P < 0. 05).

Based on previous study of existing friction material problems, hybrid biological fiber-reinforced resin-based friction materials (HBRMs, from the <b>reinforced</b> <b>fiber</b> component of resin-based friction materials) were explored in this study. Bamboo fiber, jute fiber and wool fiber (all have length of 3 - 5 mm) were processed to make three types of HBRMs and considered as three factors of biological <b>reinforced</b> <b>fiber</b> in test using orthogonal experimental design. Each factor had three levels of 1 %, 2 % and 3 % fiber mass fraction while the ratio of other raw materials remains unchanged. According to the orthogonal experimental design table, nine formulations (denoted as M 1 -M 9) were determined to test the HBRMs. For comparison, non-bio-fiber reinforced friction material (NBM) was added in the test. The properties of the HBRMs tested included Rockwell hardness, impact strength and density. The friction and wear performance of the braking materials was examined by a speed friction tester. The {{results show that the}} friction coefficient of the HBRMs was slightly higher than that of the NBM, indicating biological fibers affected the friction coefficient.
