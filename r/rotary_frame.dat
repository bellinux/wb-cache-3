40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} {{gyroscopic}} stabilization of platform. The platform consists of parallelogram, cardan frame and two contra- rotating gyroscopes. The whole system is described with five generalized coordinates and with two cyclic coordinates. We created {{a prototype of}} platform, which rotate around one axis. The prototype is designed {{with respect to a}} simple way to extend the rotation about the second axis and paralelogram. The <b>rotary</b> <b>frame</b> is driven by the gyroscope. Pneumatic motors are used to actuating gyroscopes. Pneumatic springs are used to actuating rotating frame. This paper shows also control system of platform and it introduces reached results of stabilization...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} fluid flow in a {{cylindrical}} millilitre vial stirred by a magnetic stirred bar using Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD). Stirred millilitre vials {{are used to}} study nucleation phenomena and crystallization as an outline of literature study of nucleation and crystallization phenomena {{and the role of}} stirring in this process. The baffle free vial was meshed with around 500, 000 cells. To simulate the stirring a <b>rotary</b> <b>frame</b> and moving walls were used. Stirring speeds were between 100 and 1000 rpm where considered, correspondently to a stirrer Reynolds number between 260 and 2600. For stirring speeds bellow 500 rpm, simulations by both the both laminar flow model and the k-ε model where run, while above 500 rpm only k-ε was used. Results of the two models were very similar indicative the adequacy of k-ε to simulate the flow even at low Reynolds. The flow shows expected circulation pattern with upwards pumping close to side walls and downwards pumping in the centre of cylindrical vial. At 1000 rpm circulation patterns expands {{up to the top of}} the vial while at 300 rpm and lower the upper half of the vial is poorly mixed. The average turbulent energy of the flow is very low comparing with the squared stirrer tip speed and the power number decrees with Reynolds number, indicating that the flow is not fully turbulent...|$|E
40|$|OPMILL is a {{computer}} operating system for a Kearney and Trecker milling machine that provides a fast and easy way to program machine part manufacture with an IBM compatible PC. The program gives the machinist an "equation plotter" feature which plots any set of equations that define axis moves (up to three axes simultaneously) and converts those equations to a machine milling program that will move a cutter along a defined path. Other supported functions include: drill with peck, bolt circle, tap, mill arc, quarter circle, circle, circle 2 pass, frame, frame 2 pass, <b>rotary</b> <b>frame,</b> pocket, loop and repeat, and copy blocks. The system includes a tool manager that can handle up to 25 tools and automatically adjusts tool length for each tool. It will display all tool information and stop the milling machine at the appropriate time. Information for the program is entered via a series of menus and compiled to the Kearney and Trecker format. The program can then be loaded into the milling machine, the tool path graphically displayed, and tool change information or the program in Kearney and Trecker format viewed. The program has a complete file handling utility that allows the user to load the program into memory from the hard disk, save the program to the disk with comments, view directories, merge a program on the disk with one in memory, save {{a portion of a}} program in memory, and change directories. OPMILL was developed on an IBM PS/ 2 running DOS 3. 3 with 1 MB of RAM. OPMILL was written for an IBM PC or compatible 8088 or 80286 machine connected via an RS- 232 port to a Kearney and Trecker Data Mill 700 /C Control milling machine. It requires a "D:" drive (fixed-disk or virtual), a browse or text display utility, and an EGA or better display. Users wishing to modify and recompile the source code will also need Turbo BASIC, Turbo C, and Crescent Software's QuickPak for Turbo BASIC.

40|$|A rotary power weeder was {{developed}} and evaluated. The weeder is to reduce drudgery and ensure a comfortable posture of the farmer or operator during weeding and increase production. The weeder’s component parts are: <b>frame,</b> <b>rotary</b> hoe (disk), tines, power and transmission unit. The results of field performance evaluation showed that the field capacity and weeding efficiency of the rotary power weeder were 0. 0712 ha/hr and 73 %. The cost of operation with this weeder {{was estimated to be}} N 2, 700. 00 as against N 12, 000. 00 by manual...|$|R
5000|$|Alfred Scott's first {{motorcycle}} {{was developed}} {{from his own}} [...] twin-cylinder engine design which he hand built and fitted to the steering head of a bicycle. These engines were used to power equipment such as lathes and light machinery and Scott {{had been involved in}} the manufacture of 'Premier' pedal cycles. He developed this prototype into a motorcycle and six were produced under contract by friends with a car company called Jowett in Bradford. Scott patented an early form of caliper brakes in 1897 (Patent GB 1626 of 1897), designed a fully triangulated <b>frame,</b> <b>rotary</b> induction valves, and used unit construction for his motorcycle engine.|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} principles to perform shedding motion which are; cam mechanism, dobby controlled mechanism and jacquard controlled mechanism. A dobby mechanism {{consists of three}} main parts; drive mechanism, selection mechanism and mechanism for transferring motion to the <b>frames.</b> <b>Rotary</b> dobby mechanisms are being used in shedding process of high-speed weaving machines. In this paper, design and synthesis of a novel drive mechanism had been explained. The drive mechanism, which is used in this research, is an eight component lever-gear mechanism. The most important innovation is in the motion transmission mechanism on the main shaft of rotational dobby. It is known that main shaft in rotary dobby has dwell period in only one direction. The novel drive mechanism is designed to make equally timed, double stand-by positioned oscilational motion. After designing of the rotary dobby, the mechanisms are produced and montaged. It was confirmed that dobby run well and durably with all mechanism and shedding process is precisely carried out. The experimental values of dwell angles at {{the right and left}} dead-center positions are similar to theoretical values. Experimental results show that; if the drive mechanism and dobby is generated with advanced technology, it is possible to use it in dobby industry...|$|R
