50|$|On {{official}} ground combat garments, the ERDL {{pattern was}} first {{applied to the}} Tropical Combat Uniform (third model) around 1967, and was printed onto to a lightweight cotton poplin textile material. This poplin uniform was very short-lived, but it did see combat use in SEA by various U.S. Special Operations and some other units. Soon afterwards, the ERDL pattern was again applied to the Tropical Combat Uniform (third model), but was printed onto the standard <b>rip-stop</b> cotton textile material. This ERDL <b>rip-stop</b> cotton Tropical Combat Uniform version thus saw wide use in SEA after 1968, with Special Operations units and also regular units, especially as ground combat operations continued throughout the war up to late 1972.|$|E

50|$|An {{experimental}} urban camouflage Battle Dress Uniform {{was developed}} and used during the Urban Warrior exercises of 1999. The pattern, sometimes called T-pattern or T-block, consists of three gray tones arranged in a geometric pattern, intended as a 'pattern breaker' to make Marine troops harder to locate when in such environments. Like all modern BDUs, it is made of a lightweight <b>rip-stop</b> material. The pattern was never officially adopted, and it has since been superseded by MARPAT.|$|E
50|$|In late 2008, New Zealand Army {{commenced}} {{issue of}} a new combat uniform. It was still New Zealand DPM camouflage, but made in <b>rip-stop</b> material and in a new cut which was somewhat similar to the latest style of Australian DPCU, US ACU and British PCS MTP uniforms, in that the patch pockets on the shirt are replaced by internal, vertical closure pockets and the shirt is cut for wear outside the trousers, and a camouflaged rank slide is worn on the front tab.|$|E

50|$|On {{unofficial}} {{and commercial}} garments, the ERDL pattern was copied {{and used by}} U.S. commercial textile manufacturers in the late 1960s, and applied to various commercial camouflage garments for hunting or unofficial military use. Some commercial ERDL garment examples were made using cotton poplin material, and others {{were made in the}} standard <b>rip-stop</b> cotton material. Many commercial ERDL garment examples of the time were made in the pattern mirroring the U.S. Military OG-107 Fatigue Uniform, with a standard tucked-in shirt, and conventional trousers design. These commercial ERDL OG-107 Fatigue-style garments did see some combat use in SEA, such as with U.S. Navy tactical jet aviators in the 1968 timeframe.Some USAF aviators also purchased local/in-country tailor made ERDL garments and Coveralls, for combat and off-duty use.|$|E

[...] They also say (page 109) that [...] ""By losing velocity before it reaches the lower thicker atmosphere, the reentry temperatures are radically lower.... This makes reentry as safe as the climb to orbit". The skin would be made of nylon <b>rip-stop</b> polyethelene (page 111). On re-entry the orbital airship slows down at a very high altitude because it has such low mass with such a large cross section presented to the atmosphere (a low ballistic coefficient).|$|E
5000|$|The ERDL-patterned BDU {{was first}} {{introduced}} to the United States Marine Corps in 1977, as they phased out the Olive Drab Green (OD) uniform. The BDU became the issued uniform for the U.S. Army in September 1981 in the woodland camouflage pattern, to begin replacing the Olive Drab Green (OD) or OG-107 colored fatigues, which had been standard wear since the early 1950s. The change was to better conceal Marines and soldiers effectively in woodland or tropical Areas of Operation with macro shaped patterns, as opposed to OD, which had only a single shade of green. It was based primarily on the woodland colors specifically of northern Europe. It used shades of green, brown, tan, and black, initially printed onto cotton-nylon blend twill cloth, known as the [...] "Temperate Weight" [...] uniform. A newer lightweight [...] "Tropical Weight" [...] BDU uniform was introduced in 1987 with the pattern printed on 100% cotton <b>rip-stop</b> poplin cloth, to better prevent smaller rips from enlarging.|$|E
5000|$|The Flightsail is {{a single}} seat open cockpit parasol-winged glider with {{tricycle}} landing gear. The fuselage is constructed of a triangular pyramid-shaped or tetrahedral truss; the pilot was positioned {{in front of the}} triangle-control frame. The framed flexible wing resembles a hang-glider arrangement as used on the kited gliders of Paresev program and by Ryan Aeronautical Company. The glider used weight-shift pendulum control using a stick with cables that shifts the cg of the frame relative to the wing pivoting above it. The wing is constructed with a 50-degree sweep based on NASA technical note D-443 and covered with polyethylene sheet with <b>rip-stop</b> fiberglass tape in a one-foot mesh pattern. The aircraft was tested by NASA test pilots Milton Orville Thompson and Victor Horton [...] to compare against the Rogallo wing being tested for space vehicle recovery. Purcell published that in an early 1962 flight session, Francis M. Rogallo also had a flight in the Flightsail; years later Purcell would have a very different aircraft using the flexible-wing in a modification which was flown by Francis M. Rogallo. Purcell's later Flight Dynamics Flightsail VII used the flexible-wing in a modified format.|$|E
50|$|The {{early the}} 1800s {{witnessed}} George Pocock using control of kite system wings to crosswind to good effect. In early the 1900s Paul Garber would produce high speed wings by two-line controls to give targets for aircraft gunners. Crosswind kite power was brought again into focus when Miles L. Loyd carefully described the mathematics and potential of crosswind kite power in 1980. In 1980 {{it was not}} possible to create an economical automatic control system to control the wings of a kite system, though passive control of crosswinding kite systems had been ancient. With the advance of computational and sensory resources fine control of the wings of a kite system became not only affordable, but cheap. In the same time significant progress was made in the materials and wing construction techniques; new types of flexible kites with good L/D ratio have been invented. Synthetic materials suitable for the wing and tether became affordable; among those materials are UHMWPE, carbon fiber, PETE, and <b>rip-stop</b> nylon. A large number of people became engaged in the sports of kitesurfing, kiteboarding, kite buggying, snowkiting, and power kiting. Multiple companies and academic teams work on crosswind kite power. Most of the progress in the field has been achieved in the last 10 years.|$|E

40|$|A {{flexible}} multi-layered covering {{article for}} {{protection against the}} hazards {{of exposure to the}} environment of outer space is disclosed. The covering includes an outer layer section comprising an outermost lamina of woven expanded tetrafluoroethylene yarns (Gore Tex) for protecting against abrasion and tearing, an underlying weave of meta-aramid yarns (Nomex) and para-aramid yarns (Kevlar) for particle impart protection, and electrostatic charge dissipation and control system incorporated therein, and a chemical contaminants control barrier applied as a coating. A middle section includes a succession of thermal insulating layers of polymeric thermoplastic or thermoforming material, each of which is coated with a metal deposit of high infra-red emissivity and low solar radiation absorption characteristics and separated from adjacent insulating layers by a low thermal conductance material. The covering further includes a radiation attenuating layer of a tungsten-loaded polymeric elastomer binder for protecting against bremsstrahlung radiation and an inner layer of <b>rip-stop</b> polyester material for abrasion protection. A chloroprene coating may be supplied the polyester-material for added micrometeroid protection. Securing means of low heat conductance material secures the multi-layers together as a laminar composite...|$|E
