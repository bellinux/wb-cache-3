40|$|Recent {{experimental}} {{progress has}} enabled cold atomic gases {{to be studied}} at nano-kelvin temperatures, creating new states of matter where quantum degeneracy occurs - Bose-Einstein condensates and degenerate Fermi gases. Such quantum states are of macroscopic dimensions. This book presents the phase space theory approach for treating the physics of degenerate quantum gases, an approach already widely used in quantum optics. However, degenerate quantum gases involve massive bosonic and fermionic atoms, not massless photons. The book begins with a review of Fock states for systems of identical atoms, where large numbers of atoms occupy the various single particle states or modes. First, separate modes are considered, and here the quantum density operator is represented by a phase space distribution function of phase space variables which <b>replace</b> <b>mode</b> annihilation, creation operators, the dynamical equation for the density operator determines a Fokker-Planck equation for the distribution function, and measurable quantities such as quantum correlation functions are given as phase space integrals. Finally, the phase space variables are replaced by time dependent stochastic variables satisfying Langevin stochastic equations obtained from the Fokker-Planck equation, with stochastic averages giving the measurable quantities. Second, a quantum field approach is treated, the density operator being represented by a distribution functional of field functions which replace field annihilation, creation operators, the distribution functional satisfying a functional FPE, etc. A novel feature of this book is that the phase space variables for fermions are Grassmann variables, not c-numbers. However, we show that Grassmann distribution functions and functionals still provide equations for obtaining both analytic and numerical solutions. The book includes the necessary mathematics for Grassmann calculus and functional calculus, and detailed derivations of key results are provided...|$|E

50|$|A few unexplained occurrences in the {{original}} game are now resolved. Many new cutscenes {{have been added to}} the game which expand on the story. Several of the cutscenes in {{the original}} have been extended. The way the player obtains the endings in the game are no longer determined by what difficulty has been selected. Endings are instead determined by how you play the game. The game receives two completely new endings in addition to the ones obtained from the original and Xbox versions. The game has a new theme song not {{in the original}}. A new mode, Haunted House, has been added, a mode in which players slowly walk around a set course in first person and scary events randomly occur, the player can search for haunted dolls while a ghost chases after you, where you can take pictures of ghosts from the game and receive rankings on your spirit level (based on your fear meter that amasses when playing), a second player may attempt to scare you by pressing buttons on a second Wii remote, causing random events to occur.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, a novel {{weighted}} cross prediction (WCP) mode {{is proposed}} to <b>replace</b> DC <b>mode</b> in Intra_ 4 x 4 prediction of H. 264 /AVC.

This scheme uses simple prediction equations with fixed weighting coefficients.
