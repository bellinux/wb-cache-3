50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} in 1962 by English Electric at their Vulcan Foundry in Newton-le-Willows to demonstrate its wares to British Railways. As the Deltics were then in production, {{it was decided to}} produce the locomotive on the same production line; the bodyshell used for DP2 reputedly being the eighteenth made. While DP2 looked like a Class 55 locomotive in outline, there were many detail differences; particularly the large bodyside radiator vents at one end, and the single <b>roof</b> <b>fan</b> as opposed to the four symmetrically placed fans on the Deltics. These differences revealed that DP2 was totally different from the twin-engined Deltics internally, having only a single prime mover and generator. The loco was later updated with electronic control systems to become the forerunner of the Class 50.|$|E
40|$|Fully generic 3 D {{shapes of}} {{centrifugal}} <b>roof</b> <b>fan</b> vanes are explored {{based on a}} custom-developed numerical workflow {{with the ability to}} vary the vane 3 D shape by manipulating the control points of parametric surfaces and change the number of vanes and rotation speed. An excellence formulation is based on design flow efficiency, multi-regime operational conditions and noise criteria for various cases, including multi-objective optimization. Multiple cases of optimization demonstrate the suitability of customized and individualized fan designs for specific working environments according to the selected excellence criteria. Noise analysis is considered as an additional decision-making tool for cases where multiple solutions of equal efficiency are generated and as an additional criteria for multi-objective optimization. The 3 D vane shape enables further gains in efficiency compared to 2 D shape optimization, while multi-objective optimization with noise as an additional criterion shows potential to greatly reduce the <b>roof</b> <b>fan</b> noise with only small losses in efficiency. The developed workflow which comprises (i) a 3 D parametric shape modeler, (ii) an evolutionary optimizer and (iii) a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulator can be viewed as an integral tool for optimizing the designs of roof fans under custom conditions...|$|E
40|$|The use of CFD as a {{tool for}} building, {{warehouses}} oro facories design requirements fulfilling about fire safety is becoming more common and reliable. Performance-based fire safety assurance procedures make use of the CFD fire modelling to evolution of fire, but they need always to be validated. This is especially difficult for big structures, with great clear volumes, where effects of natural and forced ventilation can be very scale dependent. A good opportunity to check the prediction capability of CFD codes to establish temperatures and velocities fields is the new full-scale fire test facility of the Technological Metal Centre in Murcia, Spain. It is an aluminium prismatic squared base building of 19. 5 m x 19. 5 m x 20 m, with several vents arranged in its walls and four exhaust fans at the roof. Series of experimental tests have been carried out using several heptane normalized pool-fires placed at the centre of the atrium. The data obtained from these experiments have been later used in a validation study of two CFD simulations implemented for temperature wall, ambient temperature prediction and exhaust fan assessment. The results show good agreement between experimental and numerical predictions and ventilation system is not enough to extract the hot combustion products. There is an excessive and dangerous accumulation of hot gases at {{the upper part of the}} atrium and the exhaust capacity of the <b>roof</b> <b>fan</b> must be increased. The CFD models can give the answer to that question. The authors want to acknowledge the Technological Metal Centre of Murcia for the use of their test rigs, the SAIT (Technological Research Service of the Technical University of Cartagena) and the University of Jaen for the use of their entire computing resources and their technical support.

50|$|However, the Class 25 was {{a complex}} {{locomotive}} that required high maintenance, {{especially on the}} turbine blower fans in the smokebox, whose blades needed to be replaced frequently due to damage by solid particles in the exhaust. The equally complex condensing tender also required frequent maintenance. Between 1973 and 1980, partly motivated by the spread of electric and diesel-electric traction, all but three of the locomotives were converted to free-exhausting and non-condensing locomotives and reclassified to Class 25NC. In the process their condensing tenders were also rebuilt to ordinary coal-and-water tenders by removing the condensing radiators and <b>roof</b> <b>fans</b> {{and replacing it with}} a massive round-topped water tank.

40|$|A {{cooperative}} research effort was established between the Tilden Mining Company LC, the United Steelworkers of America, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to lower respirable dust levels in an iron ore grinding and concentrator plant. This cooperative effort involved three field studies to evaluate different techniques to lower respirable dust levels. The {{greatest impact on}} lowering respirable dust concentrations throughout this facility was achieved through ventilation changes. The most significant improvement was realized by changing the ventilation profile throughout the entire facility. The ventilation to this grinding and concentrator facility was provided by approximately 40 <b>roof</b> <b>fans</b> operating in either the intake or exhaust mode. The operation of these fans was significantly changed {{in an attempt to}} pro-vide more of a directional flow pattern throughout the facility, as well as to more closely balance the intake and exhaust air volume. This change accounted for a 31 pct reduction in respirable dust levels in the primary grinding area of the mill. Another successful modification was to improve the sealing of a reclaim tunnel to the outside and by barricading the access point from the reclaim tunnel to the concentrator plant. This minimized the dust liberated in the conveyor tunnels from traveling through the reclaim tunnel and into the plant. These two modifications illustrate the impact that improvements in ventilation can have on lowering respirable dust concentrations in iron ore processing facilities...|$|R

40|$|Animals inheriting {{the slick}} hair gene have a short, sleek, and {{sometimes}} glossy coat. The {{objective of the}} present study was to determine whether slick-haired Holstein cows regulate body temperature more effectively than wild-type Holstein cows when exposed to an acute increase in heat stress. Lactating slick cows (n = 10) and wild-type cows (n = 10) were placed for 10 h in an indoor environment with a solid <b>roof,</b> <b>fans,</b> and evaporative cooling or in an outdoor environment with shade cloth and no fans or evaporative cooling. Cows were exposed to both environments in a single reversal design. Vaginal temperature, respiration rate, surface temperature, and sweating rate were measured at 1200, 1500, 1800, and 2100 h (replicate 1) or 1200 and 1500 h (replicate 2), and blood samples were collected for plasma cortisol concentration. Cows in the outdoor environment had higher vaginal and surface temperatures, respiration rates, and sweating rates than cows in the indoor environment. In both environments, slick-haired cows had lower vaginal temperatures (indoor: 39. 0 vs. 39. 4 degrees C; outdoor 39. 6 vs. 40. 2 degrees C; SEM = 0. 07) and respiration rate (indoor: 67 vs. 79 breaths/min; outdoor 97 vs. 107 breaths/min; SEM = 5. 5) than wild-type cows and greater sweating rates in unclipped areas of skin (indoor: 57 vs. 43 g. h(- 1) /m(2); outdoor 82 vs. 61 g. h(- 1) /m(2); SEM = 8). Clipping the hair at the site of sweating measurement eliminated the difference between slick-haired and wild-type cows. Results indicate that slick-haired Holstein cows can regulate body temperature more effectively than wild-type cows during heat stress. One reason slick-haired animals are better able to regulate body temperature is increased sweating rate.

50|$|It {{is similar}} to the <b>roof</b> mounted solar <b>fan,</b> except that its {{installation}} is a little different. Most attic fans are installed on the roof surface, whereas gable fans are installed in the gables, inside the attic and behind an existing louvered gable vent as the name suggests.

These types of fans are generally installed behind intake grills to provide ventilation. Gable Solar Fans are usually installed high on the gable close to the ridge and are also coupled with soffit or roof vents for well-balanced intake and exhaust air avenues. The airflow depends upon the level of sunlight when there is more sunlight, the airflow will be more resulting in enhanced cooling. It is also capable of lowering the air conditioning costs by cooling the attic.|$|R

Their Leo Sect was shown speeding down the highways of Shanghai, China as they are being pursued by Spider-Man and Mockingbird in his new Spider-Mobile. Mockingbird told Nick Fury, Jr. that Zodiac broke into Parker Industries' Shanghai branch and stole some servers which {{would allow them to}} hack into the Webware devices. Nick Fury, Jr. tells them to not let it fall into Zodiac's hands and Spider-Man tells him {{he has no intention of}} letting S.H.I.E.L.D. have access to it either, cutting off Fury's protests by threatening to stop designing tech for S.H.I.E.L.D. As they swerve to avoid energy bolts, Spider-Man boasts of his superior driving skills. In the driver's seat of the Zodiacs' getaway car, Leo tells his Leo Sect grunts to take out the road. As Mockingbird complains that the Spider-Mobile is slowing down, Spider-Man tells her not to worry about crashing because it has web-fluid airbags. The Zodiac thugs blow up a car, destroying the road, but as they gloat the Spider-Mobile tails them, driving along the underside of the overpass. Cheered on by the citizens of Shanghai, Spider-Man switches the steering over to Mockingbird and opens the <b>roof,</b> addressing his <b>fans</b> in Mandarin, which he picked up taking his driving lessons. The Spider-Mobile's wheels unfold into insectoid legs and it flips over, cutting off the Zodiacs' escape. Spider-Man jumps onto the hood of their car, displaying a couple of the new webbing types he developed: micro-coiled Z-metal [...] "Bug Zappers" [...] capable of being electrified, and shock-absorbing expanding web-foam. The Zodiacs' car crashes and Spider-Man checks on the citizens to see if anyone's hurt. When one of them reprimands him for letting Zodiac's Leo Sect escape, Spider-Man states he's delegating their apprehension to Mockingbird, who knocks the grunts out and interrogates Leo as to why Zodiac has been trying to steal the Webware servers. Leo bites a suicide pill, but Spider-Man shoots him with an antidote he developed griping that he's tired of them killing themselves. Mockingbird accuses him of adhering to his [...] "no-one dies around me" [...] idealism, but Spider-Man tells her he's not so naive anymore and simply wants to save everyone he can. Later on at Max Modell and Hector Baez' wedding, Zodiac's Pisces Sect emerges from the river. While Peter offers himself up as a distraction, Hobie Brown changes into his Spider-Man costume. The leader of the Pisces Sect reveals they are after Peter's Webware specifically, because it has access to restricted data caches. Disguised as Spider-Man, Hobie intervenes and Peter tells Sajani to help the wedding guests (who are former Horizon Labs employees) find cover. Hobie's lack of a Spider-Sense gets him knocked out of the fight and Peter realizes that he could be killed. Encrypting his Webware, he gives it to the Pisces Sect who depart as the police arrive. Peter tells Hobie to change into his Prowler costume and that they'll retrieve the Webware together before Zodiac undoes his encryption while the Horizon Lab alumni lament that they'll find themselves targeted by supervillains again as they reminisced over past incidents.|$|R
