5|$|For the 1980 Grand Prix season, the Yamaha factory {{made the}} Yamaha USA team of Roberts and Carruthers {{the de facto}} factory racing team. The season got {{underway}} two months late due to cancellation of Austrian and Venezuelan rounds. Barry Sheene {{had been replaced by}} Randy Mamola as the top Suzuki rider as, Sheene had been dissatisfied with the Suzuki's efforts and had turned to a privateer Yamaha team. Roberts won the first three races as the Suzuki team appeared to be in disarray, but by the third race, the Suzukis of Mamola and Marco Lucchinelli were making things more difficult for Roberts. Roberts' Yamaha suffered a deflating front tire and a faulty <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber in the Netherlands forcing him {{to pull out of the}} race, but his main championship rivals also suffered setbacks with Cecotto, Ferrari and Hartog all missing races due to injuries and Sheene suffering mechanical breakdowns. Suzuki riders went on to win the last four races, but Roberts had built up a sufficient point lead to hold on and clinch his third consecutive 500cc world championship.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{mountain}} bicycles with {{rear suspension}} systems have a pivoting rear triangle to actuate the <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber. There is much manufacturer {{variation in the}} frame design of full-suspension mountain bicycles, and different designs for different riding purposes.|$|E
25|$|The Indian Chieftain touring {{motorcycle}} is {{the first}} Indian model with front fairing and hard saddlebags. It has a stereo with speakers in the fairing, Bluetooth media players, tire pressure sensors, air-adjustable <b>rear</b> <b>shock,</b> and motorized windshield adjustment. Initial reports from the press were favorable for styling, performance, and handling. The Chieftain was named 2013 Motorcycle of the Year by RoadRunner Motorcycle Touring & Travel magazine.|$|E
50|$|Changes {{included}} new CV carbs, {{a clutch}} upgrade, modified fork internals, new switchgear, tail light, and different <b>rear</b> <b>shocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A sports {{production}} model was introduced (SP) which incorporate {{among other things}} no passenger foot pegs and the <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> were visible under the seat.|$|R
5000|$|Shocks/Struts â€” The Cobra {{outsourced}} {{production of}} shocks and struts to the aftermarket manufacturer Tokico. The components used were specifically valved {{for the new}} car. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-18124-A (front struts) and F3ZZ-18125-A (<b>rear</b> <b>shocks).</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded with a 43mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders {{having a}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> {{is also a}} Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The swingarm is similar in design to the old one, but was strengthened. Front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, slipper clutch. The final drive ratio was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.|$|E
500|$|Johnson and Burton stated it was {{difficult}} to achieve a rhythm because of the small fuel cells mandated for the race and the hard-compound tires. Temperatures had been warmer than the previous day's Busch Series race and this gave the drivers more grip although sliding was observed during both events. McMurray noted it {{was difficult}} to drive alongside other cars and that other competitors drove cautiously. Kenny Francis, Kahne's crew chief, stated that he preferred to see longer runs but was aware that safety had to be taken into consideration. Four days after the race, Penske Racing South were given penalties for Kurt Busch's car. The penalties, for [...] "actions detrimental to stock car racing"; [...] "car, car parts, components and/or equipment that do not conform to NASCAR rules"; and a right <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber that did not compress, included a $25,000 fine and a two race suspension for crew chief Roy McCauley who was placed on probation until December 31, 2006. Crew chief Matt Gimbel took over McCauley's role at the next race weekend. Team owner Roger Penske and Kurt Busch were penalized 50 points in the Owners' and Drivers' Championships. The following day, Penske Racing South announced it would not appeal the penalties.|$|E

5000|$|The DT50M {{was fitted}} with twin <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> and 19"/17" [...] {{front and rear}} wheels, this is in {{contrast}} to the later model DT50MX, which had larger 21"/18" [...] wheels and a monoshock rear suspension.|$|R
50|$|These replicas {{followed}} the original chassis designs accurately. The frames were T.I.G welded, and employed either AJS Stormer wheel hubs, British Hubs or Grimeca hubs. Betor or Marzocchi front forks were fitted, usually with Sebac <b>rear</b> <b>shocks.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} offer custom-built <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> for motorcycles. These shocks are assembled for a specific motorcycle and rider combination, {{taking into account the}} characteristics of the motorcycle, the weight of the rider, and the rider's preferred riding style/aggressiveness.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 1920s, batch by batch {{reliability}} of buses could be unpredictable and often required running adjustments. The combination the build quality of early AEC vehicles and the professionalism of the Corporation's garage staff produced in-service mileage figures and engine life that Commercial Motor praised as [...] "exceptionally good". Measures taken included mandatory defect reporting by drivers {{at the end}} of each shift, a preventative maintenance regime which called for inspection/repairs every 10 days (with the spare parts inventory including complete engines) with close monitoring of parts usage, and an overhaul/repaint cycle of every 18 months. In order to improve the system, the Corporation was performing its own modifications to buses as early as 1921, experimenting with a new type of <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber using rubber pads on one of its Leylands, and widening the doors of buses during overhaul. Examples of in-house innovation included portable bus electrics testing apparatus in 1932 and the establishment in the 1940s of a soap making plant inside the Laundry at Shrubhill Depot, in response to the need for a soap which didn't damage vehicle paintwork.|$|E
2500|$|While similar Rogue and American models had drum brakes, the SC package {{came with}} front discs, a heavier sway bar, {{as well as}} {{strengthened}} drive train and body components. These included connectors between {{the front and rear}} subframes. The rear end used staggered (fore and aft) <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorbers to eliminate wheel hop (axle wrap) under extreme acceleration conditions with leaf spring suspensions. The staggered shocks required a special plate riveted in the trunk pan, as well as brackets for the subframe end of upper torque links. Other body modifications differentiating all Hurst SC Ramblers from regular hardtop Ramblers included rolling back front and rear wheel openings to allow for larger tires. American Motors called on Hurst to help develop a vehicle for the racing market. Because of stock class rules, a minimum of 500 identical vehicles had to be produced and sold. This led to the SC Hurst Rambler, (SC) meaning [...] "Super Car". This vehicle is commonly referred to as a [...] "Scrambler", although Jeeps later used the SCRAMBLER name.|$|E

50|$|MBX7RThe 7R {{features}} a revised chassis and control arm setup along with new 16 mm big bore <b>shocks.</b> The <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> had a shorter stroke by 4 mm compared to its predecessor. MBX-7R The vehicle {{was released in}} December 2014.|$|R
50|$|In {{terms of}} adjustment, <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> span the range from no {{adjustments}} whatsoever to pre-load adjustments only to racing shocks with adjustments for length, pre-load, and four {{different kinds of}} damping. Most shocks have internal oil reservoirs, but some have external ones, and some offer air-assisted damping.|$|R
50|$|The boxed steel chassis {{is joined}} to a cage of chrome-molybdenum tubes {{creating}} the framework inside the vehicle. Another cage connects the engine/gearbox compartment to <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> attacks. These solutions {{contribute significantly to}} the structural rigidity of the chassis {{and at the same}} time guarantee the safety of the occupants.|$|R

50|$|Debut {{of a new}} <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber, {{providing}} rebound as well as preload adjustment.|$|E
50|$|By now the GT and Sport had steel fuel tanks. The GT had shorter <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> {{to lower}} seat height for the American market, but it meant the bike would ground out more easily when cornering. The Amals on the GT were {{replaced}} by 30 mm DellOrtos with accelerator pumps. This reduced fuel economy a little.|$|R
50|$|Honda had {{produced}} a Honda RC series six-cylinder race bike in the mid-1960s, but the CBX was Honda's first production 6 cylinder road bike. The CBX's advanced DOHC 24-valve inline six-cylinder engine was its outstanding feature; {{but in other}} respects the bike was conventional, having telescopic forks, a tubular frame, twin <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> and straight handlebars.|$|R
50|$|Other {{features}} include heavy duty <b>rear</b> <b>shocks,</b> heavy duty radiator with seven blade fan {{to keep it}} cool, deep groove pulleys, a high capacity oil pump, solid-lifter cam, and a roller timing chain to reduce stretch and provide more reliable performance. A transistorized duel points breaker distributor coupled with a Prestolite ignition and solid core wires was also used.|$|R

5000|$|... 1966-1967: The A1 was {{available}} {{with either a}} candy red or candy blue with chrome parts and black frame. The fuel tank had rubber knee grips, metal Kawasaki flag emblem and 2 white stripes at the bottom. Rear fender, lower <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber, chain guard, {{and parts of the}} front fork assembly were chrome. Front fender was stainless steel, a novelty then. Upper fork, headlight and speedometer combination as well as upper <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber and side-mounted oil reservoir covers were painted.|$|E
50|$|Four {{individual}} small air breathers: Replaces stock setup with altered {{crankcase breather}} hose re-routed {{into a single}} air cleaner (different style air cleaners were available over the years). Sprint fastback 904 venttop: Very attractive large fiberglass roof attachment, which gives the late model Corvair coupe a fastback appearance (not available for convertible or sedan). Pair of adjustable Gabriel shocks: Replaces stock <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> for better handling.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} {{conventional}} steel tube {{with the engine}} supported in a removable cradle. The suspension configuration {{is similar to that}} found on a UJM. The <b>rear</b> <b>shocks,</b> designed with a piggyback reservoir, are adjustable for preload and damping. The front suspension consists of conventional forks with adjustable damping and preload. The reinforced swing arm was designed to mimic the modified/aftermarket swingarms produced in the 1970s.|$|R
50|$|Suspension on both {{models is}} by leaf springs front and <b>rear,</b> with <b>shock</b> {{absorbers}} {{on the front}} only.|$|R
50|$|Both {{the front}} and <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> {{absorbers}} can be adjusted automatically during the run by air circuits that are controlled by an electronical control unit.|$|E
50|$|Overall {{handling}} of the R1 was improved through changes to frame and suspension. A new sub frame was designed for the 2009 R1, cast from magnesium giving lower weight aiding mass centralisation. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> absorber on the 2009 offers variable speed damping, {{as well as an}} easy to tweak pre-load via a screw adjustment. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> now connects underneath the swing arm through a different linkage; a change from previous years' models. To improve overall handling and safety, Yamaha included an electronic steering damper.|$|E
50|$|In 1976 {{the front}} {{mudguard}} stay was removed. The <b>rear</b> <b>shock</b> was stiffened. The gear indicator changed to led segments {{rather than the}} previous dot matrix. This MY sales were 9,000+.|$|E
50|$|In 2007, Honda showed two new concepts: the CB1100R and the CB1100F. Both {{were highly}} {{reminiscent}} of the original CB1100F/R, even sporting dual <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> with remote fluid reservoirs. Honda showed a revised concept at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show called the CB1100. It was shown in two variants. One being more standard while the other more 'cafe-racer' style (black exhaust, black fender, bikini fairing, tapered rear seat).|$|R
50|$|The Z1 {{featured}} full instrumentation and {{an electric}} start, produced 82 bhp {{and had a}} maximum speed of 130 mph to 132 mph(210 km/hr). It met with positive reviews from the motorcycle press, who praised its smoothness, damped vibration, easy-starting (kick-start and electric were both available), straight-line stability and linear acceleration. Steering was accurate and the bike handled well, but testers said the rear tire, chain and <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> all wore out quickly.|$|R
50|$|The Traxxas Bandit {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1995 and is Traxxas' 1/10 scale two-wheel drive buggy. It shares most of its parts with the Rustler, including the central chassis, motor, speed controls, transmission (albeit with a different gear ratio), <b>rear</b> <b>shocks</b> and shock tower, and radio system. The differences include shorter front and rear suspension arms, camber and steering links, buggy style smaller diameter and narrower wheels and tires, and a buggy style body with rear wing.|$|R
