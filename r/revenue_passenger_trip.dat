40|$|Analysis of the {{benefits}} of government modernization initiatives for airports or air traffic control are conducted using complex software models that simulate up to 60, 000 flights per day. These flight-centric simulations do not model passenger flows and therefore do not account for <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays due to cancelled flights and missed connections, which account for up to 60 % of the total <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays. This paper describes a closed-form model for estimating <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> reliability metrics from flight delay data from system-wide simulations. The outputs of the model, (i) percent passengers disrupted, (ii) average <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay, and (iii) total <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays, are derived from the probability of delayed flights and network structure parameters. The model highlights the role of network structure, in addition to flight on-time performance, on <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> reliability. These results have implications for government and industry initiatives to improve flight on-time performance through modernization, consumer protection, and the conduct of benefits analysis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{value of}} the air {{transportation}} system is the transportation of light-weight, high-value cargo, and passengers. Industry and government metrics {{for the performance of}} the air transportation focus on the performance of the flights. Previous research has identified the discrepancy between flight performance and <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> performance, and has developed algorithms for the estimation of <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> performance from publicly available data. This paper describes an analysis of <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays for 5224 routes between 309 air ports in the U. S. air transportation system for 2007. The average trip delay experienced by passengers was 24. 3 minutes for a nationwide total of 247 Million hours. Flights delayed 15 minutes or more contributed 48 % of the total delays, cancelled flights 43 %, diverted flights 3 %, and flights delayed less than 15 minutes contributed the remaining 6 %. <b>Passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays for oversold flights were negligible. Analysis of <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays for routes and airports, and the implications of these results are also discussed.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the National Airspace System (NAS) is the transportation of passengers and cargo. Since <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> time performance is positively correlated with passenger satisfaction, airfare elasticity, and airline profits, {{it follows that the}} National Air Space (NAS) performance evaluation, modernization, and consumer protection should be based on <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> performance. Publicly available regulatory measures of NAS performance, however, are based on flight data and not <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> data. Researchers, using a small set of proprietary airline data, have demonstrated that trip delays experienced by passengers due to missed connections, cancelled flights, and delayed flights are not negligible. Further this research demonstrated that flight delay data is a poor proxy for measuring <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays. This paper describes a comparative statistical analysis between flight delay data and estimated <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay data for one year’s worth of flights on the 1030 single segment routes between the OEP- 35 airports.

40|$|The {{raison d'etre}} of the Airline Passenger Transportation System (APTS) is the rapid, affordable, and safe {{transportation}} of passengers (and cargo). The top-level performance {{measure of the}} system is <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay, defined as the difference between ticketed passenger arrival time and actual passenger arrival time. <b>Passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay accounts for delays caused by cancelled flights, missed connections and diversions, as well as delayed flights. Algorithms developed to estimate passenger itineraries and <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay statistics using publicly available data, were used to generate <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay statistics for 2010. In 2010 an estimated 421 million passengers ticketed on 46. 8 million itineraries were transported on 8. 7 million flights. Passenger on-time performance was 78. 7 %. The average delay for a disrupted passenger was 67 minutes. The total trip delay experienced by passengers in 2010 was 11, 669 years. The largest contributors to total <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays were: <b>passengers</b> on direct itineraries disrupted by delayed flights- 32 %, passengers on connecting itineraries disrupted by cancelled flights- 23 %, connecting itineraries disrupted by delayed flights- 16 %, and missed connections- 14 %. Since 2007, annual <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay is down 26 %, however in 2010 1 -in- 5 passenger...|$|R
40|$|The major {{goals of}} the Air Transportation System (ATS) are to ensure the safe, efficient, and orderly {{movement}} of passengers and cargo. In general, the on-time performance of the ATS has been measured primarily with flight-based metrics. Researchers have shown that flight-based metrics do not accurately reflect the <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> experience by underestimating the impact of cancelled flights and missed connections on <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> time. This paper describes {{an analysis of the}} trends in <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> time for 2004 and 2005. The analysis indicates that a small increase in operations (0. 5 %) in conjunction with an increase in cancellations (1. 5 %) and higher load factors (5. 4 %), resulted in 17. 4 % increase in Estimated Total <b>Passenger</b> <b>Trip</b> Delays in 2005 over 2004. This result reveals the complex nonlinear relationship between the number of operations, the number of cancellations, load factor and <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays. Flight cancellations have a greater impact on <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> time than flight delays. In 2005,on average, passengers scheduled on cancelled flights experienced 549 minutes delay (+ 5. 8 %), while passengers on delayed flights experience 55 minutes delay (+ 3. 8 %) ...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} of the National Airspace System (NAS) is the transportation of passengers and cargo. It is no surprise, therefore, that <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> time performance is positively correlated with passenger satisfaction, airfare elasticity, and airline profits. Regulatory consumer information available to airline passengers provides measures of trip performance using only flight data (and not <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> data). Previously, researchers, using a small set of proprietary airline data, demonstrated that trip delays experienced by passengers due to missed connections, cancelled flights, and delayed flights are not negligible. Further they showed that flight delay data cannot {{be used as a}} proxy for <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delays.

The <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> data is derived from publicly available data-bases and accounts for delays experienced by passengers on single segment routes due to cancelled flights as well as delayed flights. The statistical analysis indicates that: (i) the percentage of on-time flights is statistically equivalent to the percentage of on-time passengers, (ii) the average <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay is 34 minutes in excess of the average flight delay, and (iii) average <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> delay for the worst 5 % of delayed passengers is 150 minutes in excess of the flight delay. The implications of these results for consumers and consumer protection are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Coordination {{of health}} and human service {{transportation}} programs in rural communities provides a source of sustainable funding for public transit. Significant funding is available for non-emergency medical transportation (NEMT) for Medicaid-eligible clients. In 2009, 21 of the 39 rural transit districts in Texas received NEMT funds under the Texas Medical Transportation Program (MTP). The benefits of MTP funds to rural transit districts are an additional funding source, a consistent cash flow through regular reimbursement for MTP services, and the opportunity to maximize resources (vehicles, miles, hours) by combining MTP <b>passenger</b> <b>trips</b> with general public transit. However, MTP may also increase resources required (miles, hours) to deliver transportation due to program service requirements, resulting in a higher cost per <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> and reduced productivity due to longer trip lengths and time. The purpose of this research is to develop a resource-based cost allocation methodology to accurately reflect cost and resources by MTP and general public <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> and apply the methodology to five case studies to analyze the impact of MTP trips on general public transit service. Results of the case study analysis reveal that in four of the five case studies, MTP is more resource intensive than general public transportation. MTP <b>passenger</b> <b>trips</b> have longer trip lengths than general public trips ranging from additional mileage per <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> of 13 to 40 miles. Using a resource-based cost allocation methodology, in four of the five case studies, MTP trips have higher operating cost per boarding as compared to general public service ranging from a difference of $ 12 to as much as a $ 32 per <b>passenger</b> <b>trip.</b> Four of the five case study rural transit districts do not cover the full cost of providing MTP service with MTP revenues with a shortfall ranging from approximately $ 6. 00 per <b>passenger</b> <b>trip</b> to $ 19. 00 per <b>passenger</b> <b>trip.</b> The cumulative impact of MTP on the Texas Performance Funding Formula was found to be positive resulting from the significant positive impact on the local investment indicator. However, the additional funding generated by MTP in the funding formula is still not sufficient to compensate fully for the deficits found...|$|R
