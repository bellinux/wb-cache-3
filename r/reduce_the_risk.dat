5|$|Aspirin {{is thought}} to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is {{particularly}} beneficial for colorectal cancer (CRC). It may also slightly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.|$|E
5|$|Peregrine falcons {{handled by}} falconers are also {{occasionally}} used to scare away birds at airports to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of bird-plane strikes, improving air-traffic safety. They {{were also used}} to intercept homing pigeons during World War II.|$|E
5|$|Poultry is {{the second}} most widely eaten type of meat {{globally}} and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat.

50|$|Use of GGBS {{significantly}} <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of damages {{caused by}} alkali-silica reaction (ASR), provides higher resistance to chloride ingress — <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of reinforcement corrosion — and provides higher resistance to attacks by sulfate and other chemicals.|$|R
5000|$|The foil {{does not}} {{come in contact with}} <b>the</b> explosive, which <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of {{corrosion}} of the foil or chemical reactions between the foil and explosive producing unstable compounds, and secondarily further <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of accidental electrical ignition of the explosive.|$|R
25|$|Since {{vascular}} dementia {{is the second}} most common form of dementia (after Alzheimer's disease), <b>reducing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of cerebrovascular disease also <b>reduces</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of dementia. Thus, physical exercise, having good blood cholesterol, healthy body weight and blood pressure lowers <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of developing dementia.

5|$|Predation by orcas on whale calves in high productivity, high {{latitude}} areas {{has been}} hypothesised {{to be the}} reason for great whale migrations to low productivity tropical waters, to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of attacks on the highly vulnerable calves due to lower density of orcas in these waters.|$|E
5|$|Prophylactic cranial {{irradiation}} (PCI) {{is a type}} of radiotherapy to the brain, used to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of metastasis. PCI is {{most useful}} in SCLC. In limited-stage disease, PCI increases three-year survival from 15% to 20%; in extensive disease, one-year survival increases from 13% to 27%.|$|E
5|$|Thrombolysis is the {{administration}} of an enzyme (intravenous or directly into the affected vein through a catheter), which acts to enzymatically break up clots. This may <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of post-thrombotic syndrome by a third, and possibly <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of leg ulcers, but is {{associated with an increased}} risk of bleeding. The ACCP currently suggests anticoagulation rather than thrombolysis, but patients may choose thrombolysis if prevention of post-thrombotic syndrome outweighs concerns over the complexity, bleeding risk, and cost of the procedure. NICE recommends that thrombolysis is considered in those who have had symptoms for less than two weeks, are normally well, have a good life expectancy and a low risk of bleeding.|$|E

The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five-fold following a needle-stick injury. As of 2013, the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications—tenofovir, emtricitabine and raltegravir—as this may <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> further.|$|E

5|$|A {{decompression}} {{algorithm is}} used to calculate the decompression stops needed for a particular dive profile to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of decompression sickness occurring after surfacing {{at the end of a}} dive. The algorithm can be used to generate decompression schedules for a particular dive profile, decompression tables for more general use, or be implemented in dive computer software.|$|E
5|$|A {{decompression}} {{schedule is}} a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for {{increasing amounts of}} time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface to <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up {{a large part of}} the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Divers Alert Network in 2004 {{suggests}} that {{addition of a}} deep (c. 15m) {{as well as a}} shallow (c. 6m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.|$|E

Oxidative stress {{can be considered as}} either a cause or consequence of some diseases, an area of research stimulating drug development for antioxidant compounds for use as potential therapies.|$|E
5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and <b>reduce</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At that point, the incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
