500|$|The {{large size}} of the coins, {{combined}} with the thick rim where the inscription was incuse i.e. punched into the metal rather than raised from it, led to the coins being nicknamed [...] "cartwheels". The design was by Boulton's employee Conrad Küchler. The obverse of the cartwheel coinage is a laureated right-facing bust of George III, with the inscription GEORGIUS III D G REX, while the reverse showed Britannia seated on a <b>rock,</b> <b>facing</b> left, holding an olive branch and trident with the inscription BRITANNIA 1797. Although Britannia had long appeared on the halfpenny and farthing, the 1797 coinage {{was the first time}} she was depicted ruling the waves, an allegory for Britain's status as a maritime power. The word SOHO may be seen in fine print on the face of the rock just below the shield. Boulton's pennies and twopences were meant to contain their face value in copper, i.e. they weighed one and two ounces each (penny [...] 28.3grams, diameter 36 millimetres). [...] In English measure, the penny was just over 1.4 inches in diameter, so that 17 pennies side by side would measure two feet. Boulton obtained a copy of the Royal Society's standard foot to get the measurement right. Even though pennies were struck first, reserving the twopences for later, the Soho Mint had trouble stamping such large pieces of copper, and Boulton built a new mint at Soho, where by 1799, each press was striking 60 pennies a minute. The 1,250 tonnes of [...] "cartwheels" [...] struck at Soho between 1797 and 1799 (all pieces were dated 1797) exceeded the total copper coinage by the Royal Mint in the 18th century.|$|E
2500|$|There {{is a great}} {{contrast}} between the austere, minimalist exterior of the Church of St Thomas of Canterbury and English Martyrs and its elaborately decorated interior. [...] Architecturally, Charles Alban Buckler was a medievalist who worked almost exclusively in the Gothic Revival style—particularly Early English Gothic. [...] His church at St Leonards-on-Sea was {{a good example of}} this: typical Gothic exterior features included trefoil and tall lancet windows, a multi-sided apse and buttressing. [...] The walls are of ironstone and Bath Stone with some irregular <b>rock</b> <b>facing.</b> [...] The plan consists of a nave with six bays and vaulted side chapels treated like simple arcades, a chancel with its own side chapels (all with apsidal ends), a porch, sanctuary, narthex and mortuary chapel (a later addition). [...] The building lacks a tower or spire, and the effect from the outside is an appearance [...] "as sparing as a friars' church".|$|E
60|$|About this time, three store ships {{fortunately}} {{arrived from}} England, with powder, shell, and other stores. As {{there could be}} no longer any doubt that the attack was, this time, to be delivered on the sea face; strong working parties were employed in strengthening the water batteries, in erecting lines of palisades, to prevent a landing from boats, and in building furnaces for the heating of shot in these batteries, also. At this time the Engineers began to drive a gallery through the <b>Rock,</b> <b>facing</b> the neutral ground, in order to place guns there. This work was carried on {{to the end of the}} siege, and the batteries thus erected are now among the strongest of the defences of Gibraltar.|$|E

50|$|The main hotel, a Napoleon III château, {{is located}} on the {{southern}} tip of the Cap d'Antibes in 22 acres of pine trees and tropical gardens. It houses 117 suites. In addition, there are two private villas, the Villa Eleana (in front of the property) and the Villa Les Cèdres (in the property). Owner Maja Oetker decorates the rooms and suites. In 2011, the hotel underwent a $67 million renovation. Within the complex there are six clay tennis courts, a spa, fitness center, shopping, hair dresser and nine acres of lush greenery. The swimming pool is a heated salt water pool, cut into {{the edge of the cliff}} in 1914. Thirty-three cabanas are located in the <b>rock</b> <b>facing</b> the sea.|$|E
50|$|Oyster Bay {{was settled}} by the Dutch, {{and was the}} {{boundary}} between the Dutch New Amsterdam colony and the English New England Colonies. The English, under Peter Wright, first settled in the area in 1653. The boundary between the Dutch and English was somewhat fluid which led to each group having their own Main Street. Many Quakers came to Oyster Bay, escaping persecution from Dutch authorities in New Amsterdam. These included Elizabeth Feake and her husband Captain John Underhill, whom she converted to Quakerism. Other notable Quakers to settle in Oyster Bay were the brothers John Townsend and Henry Townsend. Noted dissenter and founder of Quakerism George Fox visited Oyster Bay in 1672, where he spoke with the Wrights, Underhill and Feake at a Quaker gathering on the site of Council <b>Rock,</b> <b>facing</b> the Mill Pond.|$|E
