30|$|The northwestern {{margin of}} Junggar Basin is an {{important}} block of stratigraphic hydrocarbon <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration.</b> A number of unconformity-related stratigraphic reservoirs were found in Xiazijie, Urho, Mabei, Xiaoguai and other regions (Wang et al. 2005), from which {{the oil and gas}} reserves accounts for 10 % of the total reserves, indicating a good exploration prospect of stratigraphic reservoirs. However, major breakthrough still not been made in the clastic stratigraphic <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration</b> of northwestern margin of Junggar Basin since 2005. Diagenetic characteristics of unconformity and their influence on physical properties, quantitative research of diagenesis are the key limits to stratigraphic hydrocarbon <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration.</b> In this paper, through outcrop and indoor core observation and analysis of thin sections, casting thin sections, scanning electron microscopy, we take the semi-weathered rock layer of unconformity at lower Jurassic in Xiazijie area of Junggar Basin as an example to discuss the diagenetic characteristics of the unconformable semi-weathered rock layer. In order to deepen the understanding of unconformity and guide fine exploration and development of stratigraphic hydrocarbon reservoirs, we also evaluated the main diagenesis and the impact on physical properties of the carrier bed.|$|E

Numerous {{test data}} accumulates {{in the process}} of gas <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration</b> and development, so it is {{necessary}} to apply the data mining technology to this process. Influenced by the geologic factors such as structure, deposition and diagenesis, tight sandstone gas reservoir formation types are so diversified that traditional cross-plot analysis technique hardly identify the formation types.

40|$|The spatial {{structural}} {{characteristics of}} geological anomaly, including singularity and self-similarity, can be analysed using fractal or multifractal modelling. Here we apply the multifractal methods to potential fields {{to demonstrate that}} singularities can characterise geological bodies, including rock density and magnetic susceptibility. In addition to enhancing weak gravity and magnetic anomalies with respect to either strong or weak background levels, the local singularity index (α ≈ 2) {{can be used to}} delineate the edges of geological bodies. Two models were established {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} mapping singularities for extracting weak anomalies and delineating edges of buried geological bodies. The Qikou depression of the Dagang oilfield in eastern China has been chosen as a study area for demonstrating the extraction of weak anomalies of volcanic rocks, using the singularity mapping technique to analyse complex magnetic anomalies caused by complex geological background. The results have shown that the singularities of magnetic data mapped in the paper are associated with buried volcanic rocks, which have been verified by both drilling and seismic survey, and the S–N and E–W faults in the region. The targets delineated for deeply seated faults and volcanic rocks in the Qikou depression should be further investigated for the potential application in undiscovered oil and gas <b>reservoirs</b> <b>exploration...</b>|$|R
40|$|In dense {{underwater}} sensor networks (UWSN), {{the major}} confronts are high error probability, incessant variation in topology of sensor nodes, and much energy consumption for data transmission. However, {{there are some}} remarkable applications of UWSN such as management of seabed and oil <b>reservoirs,</b> <b>exploration</b> of deep sea situation and prevention of aqueous disasters. In order to accomplish these applications, ignorance {{of the limitations of}} acoustic communications such as high delay and low bandwidth is not feasible. In this paper, we propose Adaptive mobility of Courier nodes in Threshold-optimized Depth-based routing (AMCTD), exploring the proficient amendments in depth threshold and implementing the optimal weight function to achieve longer network lifetime. We segregate our scheme in 3 major phases of weight updating, depth threshold variation and adaptive mobility of courier nodes. During data forwarding, we provide the framework for alterations in threshold to cope with the sparse condition of network. We ultimately perform detailed simulations to scrutinize the performance of our proposed scheme and its comparison with other two notable routing protocols in term of network lifetime and other essential parameters. The simulations results verify that our scheme performs better than the other techniques and near to optimal in the field of UWSN.

30|$|One of the {{critical}} challenges in tight <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration</b> is formation fluid identification since the conventional petrophysical approach grossly can go wrong as individual tight layers can have unique relationships. As tight reservoirs are fraccing candidates for testing and production, the legitimate information which can finalize the fraccing design in a well is the down hole fluid testing through wireline. Tight reservoir field development plan require stringent development and production designs for optimum expenditures and most of such reservoirs need to be treated and handled with a holistic approach. In Barmer basin, tight reservoir distribution and its prospectivity is definitely promising with huge hydrocarbon reserves in place.|$|E
30|$|Tight <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration</b> in Barmer basin has huge {{potential}} {{with possible}} in place volumes of multi billion barrels in reservoirs across the Mesozoic to Cenozoic stratigraphic levels. These tight reservoirs (permeability {{in the range}} of 0.01 – 10  mD) are ideal fraccing candidates for commercial production. One of the critical challenges in tight <b>reservoir</b> <b>exploration</b> is early assessment of permeability and reservoir fluid type identification through wireline formation testing (WFT) to determine flow behavior, frac optimization and expected deliverability after fraccing. The most prospective Barmer Hill (BH) and Fatehgarh (FAT) tight formations from the basin have been tested with new 3 D radial probe WFT tool providing significant time and cost optimization opportunities. Good quality fluid samples with very low contamination levels were extracted with less rig time and operational costs from very low permeable BH formation (0.18  mD/cP mobility) and FAT formation (0.35  mD/cP mobility) in 150 and 200  min respectively. 3 D radial probe and dual packer module based WFT job were compared for their efficiencies in similar environment. The results show that 3 D radial probe has less inflation time (~ 1 / 5 th), quick fluid detection (~ 1 / 10 th time), quick and reliable packer deployment, focused fluid flow regime to address the formation heterogeneity and minimum hole sticking issues due to mechanical arms around the probe. In short, 3 D radial probe can address both the uncertainties of WFT in tight reservoirs and optimized well testing and frac design for cost effective field development.|$|E

In 1953, Mobil Oil made a discovery near Drayton Valley, in a sandstone formation. By 1956, more than 1,500 development wells dotted what became the Pembina oil field (the largest field in western Canada) with hardly a dry hole among them, and the oil bearing Cardium Formation was dubbed the Cardium Freeway.
