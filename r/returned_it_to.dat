5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was able to get into field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E

5|$|Following halftime, Virginia Tech {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the second half. Texas' kickoff was fielded by Antonio Banks, who <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Tech 41-yard line. On the first play of the half, Thomas was tackled for a loss of two yards on a running play up the middle. After an incomplete pass, Druckenmiller completed a pass to Jennings, who fell down short of the first down marker. The Hokies punted, but Texas was called for a five-yard running into the kicker penalty and Tech opted to re-kick. After the second kick, Texas' offense started at its 17-yard line.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Marburger left USC {{to become}} the third {{president}} of the State University of New York at Stony Brook on Long Island, New York. At the time, state budget cuts were afflicting the university, and he <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> growth with increases in the university's science research funding from the federal government.

5|$|In February 1857 the Chelmsford Chronicle {{reported}} that £10 in silver {{had been stolen}} from Golding Spearman, keeper of the Tilbury Fort canteen.

Louis of Savoy invaded in spring of 1449, and Sforza sent Colleoni (who had earlier defected) to defeat him at Borgomanero, leading to an uneasy peace. Sforza also faced treachery within his own ranks, added {{with the fact that he}} rashly {{accepted}} the defection of his great enemies the Piccinino brothers, who, upon gaining access to Monza, promptly <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Milan.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
5|$|The Arkansas {{possession}} that ensued {{ended when}} Vinnie Sunseri intercepted a Brandon Allen pass.

Later in the quarter, Ha'Sean Clinton-Dix intercepted another Allen pass and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the three-yard line. Three plays later Lacy had his second touchdown of the game on a one-yard run and the Crimson Tide led at halftime 24–0.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{received}} the post-touchdown kickoff and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> their 31-yard line, where the Tech offense took over {{on its first}} possession of the game. Tech running back Lee Suggs ran for a three-yard gain, and quarterback Bryan Randall completed a 15-yard pass to take the Hokies to near midfield, earning Virginia Tech a first down in the process. But on the third play after taking possession, the Hokies turned the ball over as Tech running back Lee Suggs fumbled the ball. Air Force recovered the turnover and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Tech 35-yard line, where the Falcons offense returned to the field. Despite gaining possession of the ball deep inside Virginia Tech's side of the field, Air Force was unable to move the ball forward with much success. After a quick first down provided by a penalty against Virginia Tech, the Hokie defense stiffened and denied the Falcons another. Air Force was forced to attempt a 45-yard field goal, which Ashcroft converted with 7:36 left in the quarter to give the Falcons a 10–0.|$|E
5|$|With just a {{few seconds}} {{remaining}} in the first half, there appeared to be little chance that Nebraska would have a chance to score. But Nebraska received the kickoff at its 24-yard line and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Nebraska 42. Frost attempted a long pass to get Nebraska into position for a field goal attempt, but the throw fell incomplete. Instead of trying another long pass, Nebraska proceeded to run out the clock, and the Cornhuskers went into halftime with a 1714 lead.|$|E
5|$|A legend links Szczerbiec with King Bolesław I the Brave who {{was said}} to have chipped the sword by hitting it against the Golden Gate, Kiev (now in Ukraine) during his {{intervention}} in the Kievan succession crisis in 1018. However, the Golden Gate was only constructed in 1037 and the sword is actually dated to the late 12th or 13th century. It was first used as a coronation sword by Władysław I the Elbow-high in 1320. Looted by Prussian troops in 1795, it changed hands several times during the 19th century until it was purchased in 1884 for the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg, Russia. The Soviet Union <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> Poland in 1928. During World War II, Szczerbiec was evacuated to Canada and did not return to Kraków until 1959. In the 20th century, an image of the sword was adopted as a symbol by Polish nationalist and far-right movements.|$|E

5|$|A {{week after}} their loss to LSU, Alabama {{traveled}} to Starkville and defeated their long-time rival, the Mississippi State Bulldogs 24–7. After {{a pair of}} missed field goals, one from 19-yard by Cade Foster and the second from 31-yards by Jeremy Shelley, Alabama scored their first {{points in the second}} quarter. Eddie Lacy capped a five-play, 52-yard drive with a two-yard touchdown run to give the Crimson Tide a 7–0 lead. Later in the quarter Derek DePasquale missed a 41-yard field goal attempt for the Bulldogs, but on the ensuing Alabama possession Cameron Lawrence intercepted an AJ McCarron pass and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Alabama four-yard line. However, the Alabama defense held the Bulldogs to only a field goal attempt which was then missed from 29-yards by Brian Egan to preserve a 7–0 halftime lead for the Crimson Tide.|$|E
5|$|According to {{a legend}} {{recorded}} in the Greek hagiography, Jovan Vladimir built the church near Elbasan. Its location, deep in a dense forest, was chosen by God, and an eagle with a shining cross on its head showed it to Vladimir. After the saint was decapitated, he brought {{his head to the}} church, and was buried inside. A group of Franks once stole the casket with his miraculous relics. The casket turned out to be extremely heavy, breaking the backs of hinnies on which the Franks carried it. They eventually put it in the Shkumbin River {{to take it to the}} sea, but the river flooded, and the casket—radiating light—went back upstream toward the church. The inhabitants of that area took it out of the water and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the church in a festive procession.|$|E
5|$|After a ten-yard gain by Richardson {{to start}} the quarter, Alabama lost a total of seven yards on {{consecutive}} plays and a McCarron incompletion on third down set up a third long field goal attempt. This time the 49-yard attempt from Jeremy Shelley was blocked by Bennie Logan and recovered by Eric Reid who <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Alabama 48. On this LSU possession, Jordan Jefferson took over as the Tigers' quarterback, and LSU gained a first down on a six-yard Michael Ford run {{and a pair of}} short runs by Ware. However, the drive stalled again and Wing was forced to punt for LSU.|$|E

5|$|After {{winning the}} coin toss, Alabama elected {{to receive the}} ball to open the first half. Marquis Maze fielded the James Hairston kickoff and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the Alabama 30-yard line where the offense began its first series. Alabama opened {{with a pair of}} gains by Trent Richardson on an 18-yard run and on a 22-yard pass {{reception}} from AJ McCarron to reach the LSU 30-yard line. However, the drive stalled on the next three plays, and on fourth down Cade Foster missed a 44-yard field goal wide right and the game remained tied at zero. The Tigers began their first offensive series with Jarrett Lee at quarterback from their own 27-yard line. After LSU gained a pair of first downs on runs by Spencer Ware and short passes from Lee, the drive faltered, and Brad Wing punted the ball out-of-bounds at the Alabama five.|$|E
5|$|Because NC State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech received NC State's kickoff and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the 10-yard line, where the Hokie offense began work. Tech began working down the field, running the ball for short gains and throwing passes for longer gains. Tech picked up three first downs, then reached NC State territory on a pass to Donnelly. Once on the NC State side of the field, Tech picked up another first down, but Tech's quarterback was sacked on third down for a loss, and the Hokies were forced to punt the ball away. The ball landed at the NC State 12-yard line where the Wolfpack began a drive.|$|E
5|$|Bryan Still fielded the Tennessee kickoff and <b>returned</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> the 19-yard line of Virginia Tech. After a short pass, DeShazo {{threw his}} second {{interception}} of the game. Tennessee defender John Summers returned the catch to the Tech 19-yard line, and backup quarterback Branndon Stewart {{returned to the}} game for Tennessee's offense. James Stewart took the first play of the Volunteers' drive, an eight-yard gain, then backup Jay Graham entered the game {{and ran to the}} five-yard line for a first down. After the next play—, a two-yard run by Graham—Tennessee committed a 15-yard personal foul penalty, pushing the Volunteers back to the 17-yard line. Branndon Stewart completed a pass to tight end David Horn, pushing Tennessee back to the three-yard line, but not gaining enough for a first down. Tennessee kicker John Becksvoort returned to the game, and his 19-yard field goal attempt was good, giving the Volunteers a 4516 lead with 9:41 to go in the game.|$|E
