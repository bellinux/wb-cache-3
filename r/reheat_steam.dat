40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{targeted}} at <b>reheated</b> <b>steam</b> temperature’s large time delay and strong nonlinearity characteristics in power plant, a multi-model predictive control strategy is proposed {{in light of}} the nonlinear characteristics of steam temperature control. This strategy utilizes the linearized model of nonlinear process at multiple working points to divide the process into several subspaces. A relatively accurate fixed model can be found in each subspace. Based on this, a global approximation model of complex object could be obtained. Simulation and application results show no matter for stable or load varying process, <b>reheated</b> <b>steam</b> temperature can be maintained in the required control range. It is much superior to the traditional PID control method...|$|R

5000|$|For {{a typical}} late 20th-century power plant, {{superheated}} steam from the boiler is delivered through 14 - 16 in diameter piping at [...] and 1000 F to the high-pressure turbine, where it falls in pressure to [...] and to 600 F in temperature through the stage. It exits via 24 - 26 in diameter cold reheat lines and passes {{back into the}} boiler, where the steam is reheated in special reheat pendant tubes back to 1000 F. The hot <b>reheat</b> <b>steam</b> is conducted to the intermediate pressure turbine, where it falls in both temperature and pressure and exits directly to the long-bladed low-pressure turbines and finally exits to the condenser.|$|E
30|$|A {{solution}} {{like this}} has many advantages because a substantial rise in the temperature of <b>steam,</b> especially <b>reheated</b> <b>steam,</b> increases {{the problem of the}} difference between the bleed steam and the saturation temperatures in regenerative heaters fed with bleeds from the intermediate-pressure turbine, which are situated right after the steam reheater. This causes material and thermodynamic problems because, with the rise in the mean difference in temperature of the heat-exchanging agents, the exergy losses rise too which leads to a reduction in the process effectiveness and to an increase in the heating steam consumption. By keeping pressures in the bleeds of the auxiliary turbine at the same level as in the intermediate-pressure turbine, the temperature difference in the exchangers will be much lower (the outlet of this turbine is even in the area of saturated steam). Another advantage of the master cycle is that the construction of an intermediate-pressure turbine without bleeds is much simpler and cheaper. This is essential in view of the need to use expensive construction materials. Lower temperatures of the steam in the bleeds from the driving turbine, compared to the intermediate-pressure turbine, result in an increase in the mass flow from them. This causes a reduction in the steam mass flow to the reheater, i.e., lower costs of the <b>reheated</b> <b>steam</b> pipelines and of the reheater in the boiler. The steam mass flow from the main turbine into the condenser is also smaller which decreases heat losses of the cycle.|$|R

The traditional approach for the predictive control in power plant requires modeling based on accurate mathematical model, and some multivariate statistical algorithm cannot avoid falling into the over-fitting, therefore these approaches is not suitable for prediction of the reheating temperature in power plants.

Coal-fired Unit 3, which has a Babcock & Wilcox 3500 psig supercritical boiler and a Westinghouse double-reheat cross compound turbine, commenced operations in 1966.

50|$|Within {{the boiler}} design activities, {{potential}} cost savings {{were identified by}} considering shortening the main and <b>reheat</b> <b>steam</b> lines using two novel arrangements. Firstly, a twin tower or inverse two-pass boiler design was considered, in which firing {{takes place in a}} first tower, with the hot combustion gases moving down and across to a second tower. The final super-heater and re-heater are arranged {{at the bottom of the}} second tower with outlet headers located close to the turbine. The arrangement minimizes the thermal movement between boiler and steam lines providing a significant reduction in the length of steam piping to 25 m and 30 m for each string of 400 MW reference plant. As an alternative arrangement, a horizontal boiler concept, designed with the outlet headers on top of the boiler was considered. The low height boiler design arrangement resulted in a similar shortening of the steam lines to around 35 m to 40 m for each string of a 400 MW reference plant.|$|E

50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1963; its total {{electrical}} capacity was 720 MW comprising six 120 MW generating units. A 120 MW Unit comprised a coal-fired (later oil-fired) boiler supplying high-pressure steam to a GEC three-cylinder <b>reheat</b> <b>steam</b> turbine, {{which in turn}} powered a hydrogen-cooled 120 MW alternator. Each unit had its own control room interposed between the boiler and turbine manned by a unit operator and an assistant unit operator. They in turn were assisted by two auxiliary plant attendants, one for the boiler, the other for the turbine plant. The electrical output of each unit, and therefore the station, was co-ordinated by a single load dispatch office who were in contact with grid control at East Grinstead. The electrical output of the station was routed by cables and overhead conductors to two grid sub stations, Northfleet East and Northfleet West, where the station fed the national grid. At full load each boiler consumed 50 tonnes of coal per hour, which was delivered by ship, first to a coal yard then to bunkers that fed cylindrical ball mills to create pulverised fuel, which was then blown into the boiler furnace. The steam conditions were 510 °C at 1500 psi. The design of this station can be considered the founding development of ever larger boiler / turbine units. As a coal-burning station, it was converted to burn oil in the early 1970s. The station closed in 1991.In 2000 the Government gave permission to Scottish and Southern Energy plc to build a 110 MW gas-fired {{combined heat and power}} station to supply the heat and electricity needs of the Kimberly-Clark paper mill at Northfleet.|$|E
