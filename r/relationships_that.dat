5|$|Joint {{attention}} {{and the ability}} to attend to an aspect of one's environment are fundamental to normal <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> rely on the sharing of experience and knowledge.

Marcos asked Imelda to help him mend ties with Lopez, and Imelda burst into tears in order to convince Lopez that he should run as the Nacionalista vice presidential candidate.|$|E

5|$|The manuscripts are {{all thought}} {{to derive from}} a common original, but the {{connections}} between the texts are more complex than simple inheritance via copying.

5|$|Although {{homosexuality}} among females {{has taken}} place in many cultures in history, a recent phenomenon is the development of family among same-sex partners. Before the 1970s, the idea that same-sex adults formed long-term committed relationships was unknown to many people. The majority of lesbians (between 60% and 80%) report being in a long-term relationship. Sociologists credit the high number of paired women to gender role socialization: the inclination for women to commit to relationships doubles in a lesbian union. Unlike heterosexual <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> tend to divide work based on sex roles, lesbian relationships divide chores evenly between both members. Studies have also reported that emotional bonds are closer in lesbian and gay relationships than heterosexual ones.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} Army's {{modernization}} {{effort in}} the 1980s corps units introduced new organizations and equipment including the M1 Abrams tank, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, AH-64 Apache helicopter, Multiple Launch Rocket System, and Mobile Subscriber Equipment. In 1987, III Corps also conducted the largest deployment of forces to Germany since the Second World War, Exercise Reforger '87. During this time, the corps began assisting in the training and support of active and reserve component units. This support involves training guidance, resources, {{and the maintenance of}} <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> extend to wartime affiliations.|$|E
50|$|A special {{relationship}} is a diplomatic <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> is especially strong.|$|R
50|$|An {{intimate}} relationship is an interpersonal <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> involves physical and/or emotional intimacy. Physical intimacy {{is characterized by}} friendship, platonic love, romantic love, or sexual activity. While the term {{intimate relationship}} commonly implies {{the inclusion of a}} sexual relationship, the term is also used as a euphemism for a <b>relationship</b> <b>that</b> is strictly sexual.|$|R

5|$|As the {{paperback}} book came into fashion, lesbian themes were relegated to pulp fiction. Many of the pulp novels typically presented very unhappy women, or <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> ended tragically. Marijane Meaker later wrote {{that she was}} told to make the relationship end badly in Spring Fire because the publishers {{were concerned about the}} books being confiscated by the U.S. Postal Service. Patricia Highsmith, writing as Claire Morgan, wrote The Price of Salt in 1951 and refused to follow this directive, but instead used a pseudonym.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> {{may lead to}} interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, {{and there is a}} lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth Bear's Carnival (2006) revisits the trope of the single-gender world, {{as a pair}} of {{gay male}} ambassador-spies attempt to {{infiltrate}} and subvert the predominately lesbian civilization of New Amazonia, whose matriarchal rulers have all but enslaved their men. In 2007, J.K. Rowling's statement that Albus Dumbledore, a character in her Harry Potter series, was gay caused some controversy. Sarah Hall's dystopian novel The Carhullan Army (2007), published in the US under the title Daughters of the North, matter of factly features lesbians as primary characters. The novel won the 2007 John Llewellyn Rhys Prize and James Tiptree, Jr. Award, and was shortlisted for the 2008 Arthur C. Clarke Award. It is perhaps telling of the evolution of public perception of same sex <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> the relationships are unmentioned or only peripherally noted in reviews.|$|E

'Napaljarri' (in Warlpiri) or 'Napaltjarri' (in Western Desert dialects) is a skin name, one of sixteen used to denote the subsections or subgroups in the kinship system of central Australian Indigenous people.

5|$|With {{insensitive}} or unresponsive caregivers, or frequent changes, {{an infant}} may have few experiences that encourage proximity seeking to a familiar person. An infant who experiences fear but who cannot find comforting information in an adult's face and voice may develop atypical ways {{of coping with}} fearfulness such as the maintenance of distance from adults, or the seeking of proximity to all adults. These symptoms accord with the DSM criteria for reactive attachment disorder. Either of these behavior patterns may create a developmental trajectory leading ever farther from typical attachment processes such as {{the development of an}} internal working model of social <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> facilitates both the giving and the receiving of care from others.|$|E

5|$|Another {{important}} source of studying ancient Tamil history are the coins {{that have been found}} in recent years in the excavations, megaliths, hoards and surface. The coins belonging to the Sangam age, found in Tamil Nadu are generally classified into three categories. The first category consists of punch-marked coins from Magadha (400 BCEâ€“187 BCE) and the Satavahanas (200 BCEâ€“200 CE). The second category is made up of coins from the Roman Empire dated from 31 BCE to 217 CE, coins of Phoenicians and Seleucids and coins from the Mediterranean region (c. 300 BCE). The third category of Sangam age Tamil coins are the punch-marked silver, copper and lead coins dated 200 BCEâ€“200 CE and assigned to the Sangam age Tamil kings. The coins belonging to the first two categories mostly attest to the trading <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> the Tamil people had with the kingdoms of northern India and the outside world. But they do not offer much information regarding the Sangam age Tamil polity. The third category of coins, however, have provided direct testimony to the existence of ancient Tamil kingdoms and have been used to establish their period to coincide with that of the Sangam literature.|$|E
5|$|In 996 {{when her}} father was posted to a {{four-year}} governorship in Echizen Province, Murasaki went with him, although it was uncommon for a noblewoman of the period to travel such a distance on a trip that could {{take as long as}} five days. She returned to Kyoto, probably in 998, to marry her father's friend Fujiwara no Nobutaka (c. 950 â€“ c. 1001), a much older second cousin. Descended from the same branch of the Fujiwara clan, he was a court functionary and bureaucrat at the Ministry of Ceremonials, with a reputation for dressing extravagantly and as a talented dancer. In his late forties {{at the time of their}} marriage, he had multiple households with an unknown number of wives and offspring. Gregarious and well known at court, he was involved in numerous romantic <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> may have continued after his marriage to Murasaki. As was customary, she would have remained in her father's household where her husband would have visited her. Nobutaka had been granted more than one governorship, and by the time of his marriage to Murasaki he was probably quite wealthy. Accounts of their marriage vary: Richard Bowring writes that the marriage was happy, but Japanese literature scholar Haruo Shirane sees indications in her poems that she resented her husband.|$|E
5|$|Janice Dickinson {{describes}} her early life where she suffered {{child abuse and}} physical abuse {{at the hands of}} her father. She writes that her three sisters and mother also experienced abuse from her father. She recounts her ups and downs during her career while finding success in the fashion industry. She emphasizes how bravery is important to success, and explains how she remained firm on her request for US$20,000 for a modeling position when the market figure at the time was only $5,000. Throughout the process she experiences emotional pain from <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> lack depth, and learns for herself about the harms of substance dependence. Incidents related to her drug addiction problems include ingesting heroin from Gia Carangi prior to a photography session in Italy, and an experience in a state of alcohol intoxication falling off a fashion runway for Valentino Garavani and landing upon Sophia Loren.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of widows engaging in independent economic activity. They can be found keeping schools, brewing ale and trading. Some were highly successful, like Janet Flockhart, an Edinburgh wadwife or moneylender, who had been left a widow with seven children after her third husband's suicide, and who managed her business affairs so successfully that she had amassed a moveable estate of Â£22,000 by her death in the late sixteenth century. The deaths of the two husbands of Mary Erskine (1629â€“1708) left her with the resources to become a highly successful business woman and philanthropist, founding the Mary Erskine School and the Trades Maiden Hospital in Edinburgh. Lower down the social scale the rolls of poor relief indicate {{that large numbers of}} widows with children endured a marginal existence and were particularly vulnerable in times of economic hardship. This may in part explain the relatively high rates of remarriage suggested by the available sources. Many widows needed financial security and widowers often needed heirs or a mother for their children. Although contemporary writers seem to have been generally pessimistic about the step-parent <b>relationships</b> <b>that</b> these remarriages created, the evidence of diaries and autobiographies from the period suggest that they were often highly successful, with many children remembering their step-parents with genuine affection.|$|E
25|$|The {{desire for}} {{intimacy}} has biological roots and, {{in the great}} majority of people, persists from birth until death.
