40|$|Studies on the {{transcriptional}} {{response to}} pathogens in the insect larval gut {{have shown the}} regulation of several genes after the infection. <b>Repat</b> (REsponse to PAThogens) genes were first identified in Spodoptera exigua midgut as being up-regulated {{in response to the}} exposure to Bacillus thuringiensis toxins and baculovirus. Recently, new members of the <b>REPAT</b> family showed a constitutive up-regulation in a B. thuringiensis-resistant population. Based on a yeast two-hybrid screening, we have detected the interaction of <b>REPAT</b> 1 {{with other members of the}} <b>REPAT</b> family, leading to the discovery of a new member: <b>REPAT</b> 8. The functional role of this interaction was shown by following the changes of the subcellular localization of <b>REPAT</b> 1 in the presence of <b>REPAT</b> 8. <b>REPAT</b> 1 alone was localized exclusively in the cytoplasm, while the presence of <b>REPAT</b> 8 led to the migration of <b>REPAT</b> 1 to the nucleus. Finally, analysis of the expression pattern of eight <b>REPAT</b> members has shown that B. thuringiensis-related treatments (Cry 1 Ca toxin, Xentari™ product and an acrystalliferous strain) induced a general up-regulation of <b>repat</b> genes, especially of <b>repat</b> 2. In contrast, no significant effect was detected after treatment with Escherichia coli or Enterococcus sp., or by the presence of microbiota in the midgut. The results suggest that the different <b>repat</b> genes play different roles in response to pathogens...|$|E

Among the objectives of this project is the elucidation {{of the structure of the}} major components of the cortex of wool fibers, the matrix phase and the intermediate filaments, as well as the elucidation of how these two phases are linked together to form a fiber. Polypeptide models of the matrix phase of wool were studied by high resolution liquid state 1 H NMR, and intact wool fibers swollen in water and D 2 O were studied by relaxation 1 H and 2 H NMR which is often performed in solid state. A network structure of the matrix phase was modeled by polypeptide systems containing fragments of high sulfur (HS) proteins from wool with Cys-residues oxidized in pairs to form a network. The oxidation of three- and four-Cys-residue peptide models of the matrix has been monitored by 2 D 1 H NMR. Two peptides, TCLQTSGCETGCG and ICSSVGTCGSSCGQPTCS, which do not contain the characteristic dipeptide and the pentapeptide <b>repats,</b> have been assigned in the initial reduced state, and then analyzed in the oxidized state.

40|$|Previously, we {{demonstrated}} successful Tn 917 mutagenesis of {{the oral}} pathogen Streptococcus mutans using pTV 1 -OK (Kmr, <b>repATs),</b> a temperature conditional replicative delivery vector carrying a lactococcal pWVO 1 Ts backbone. In this report we describe the construction and utilization of pTV 32 -OK, a plasmid harboring Tn 917 -lac (emr, L-gal) that was employed to isolate transcriptional fusions of the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene with streptococcal promoters in S. mutans strain NG 8. Tn 917 -lac transposition occurred at a frequency of ca. 1036 with 20 % of the resultant emr clones displaying varying levels of lacZ expression. Tn 917 -lac mutants that expressed L-galactosidase activity under growth conditions of glucose limitation, acidic pH, 35 mM NaCl, and elevated (42 ‡C) temperature were isolated. Further characterization {{of one of the}} mutants with increased L-gal activity under glucose limitation, strain AS 42, revealed maximal activity in batch culture in stationary phase after glucose depletion. The L-gal activity of AS 42 also was found to be repressed 3 -fold in medium containing 2 % glucose relative to measured activity from cells suspended in the same medium containing no glucose. Further phenotypic analysis revealed that AS 42 had a 30 % lower growth yield than the parent strain NG 8 when grown in pH 5 medium. Sequence analysis of the region harboring the transposon revealed that the lacZ fusion occurred near the 3 P-end of a gene encoding a homolog of an ATP binding protein from a family of Gram-positive ABC transporters. These findings demonstrate that Tn 917 -la...|$|R
40|$|The <b>repat</b> {{gene family}} encodes midgut {{proteins}} overexpressed {{in response to}} pathogen infection in the lepidopteran Spodoptera exigua. Up-regulation of <b>repat</b> genes has been observed after challenging the larvae with both Bacillus thuringiensis toxins and after infection with the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus. In our study, PCR amplification of the genomic region and genome walking were used to obtain the genomic structure and the sequence of the 5 '-upstream region of <b>repat</b> 1 and <b>repat</b> 2, {{two of the most}} phylogenetically distant members of the <b>repat</b> family. A similar gene structure between <b>repat</b> 1 and <b>repat</b> 2 has been found, with conserved exon-intron positions and junction sequences, suggesting a common origin for these genes. Recombinant baculoviruses carrying the firefly luciferase gene under the control of different 5 '-upstream regions of the <b>repat</b> 1 gene were constructed to elucidate the influence of these regions in gene expression. Infection of Helicoverpa zea gut-derived cells with the recombinant baculoviruses revealed the upstream regions of the <b>repat</b> 1 gene which are involved in gene transcription and demonstrated the role of an intron located in the 5 '-untranslated region in the enhancement of gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Insect larvae {{spend most}} of their time eating and the {{digestive}} tract is the most crucial barrier for the entrance of many pathogens. In our study, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to compare Spodoptera exigua midgut gene expression between larvae exposed to the Bacillus thuringiensis Cry 1 Ca toxin and non-exposed insects. Based on the SSH results, full cDNA sequences coding for four homologous proteins were obtained. Quantitative and semi-quantitative RT-PCR showed the increased expression of the genes coding for these proteins after exposure to different B. thuringiensis toxins as well as after infection with baculovirus. The proteins were named <b>REPAT</b> after their increased expression in Response to Pathogen. <b>REPAT</b> 1, a member of this family, was recombinantly expressed using the baculovirus expression system, revealing the glycosylated nature of the protein. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing <b>REPAT</b> 1 were used to infect larvae from S. exigua, showing that expression of <b>REPAT</b> 1 was reducing the virulence of baculovirus to the infected larvae.

40|$|<b>Repat</b> (REsponse to PAThogens) genes {{were first}} {{identified}} in the midgut of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) in response to Bacillus thuringiensis and baculovirus exposure. Since then, additional <b>repat</b> gene homologs {{have been identified in}} different studies. In this study the comprehensive larval transcriptome from S. exigua was analyzed for the presence of novel repat-homolog sequences. These analyses revealed the presence of at least 46 <b>repat</b> genes in S. exigua, establishing a new gene superfamily in this species. Phylogenetic analysis and studies of conserved motifs in these hypothetical proteins have allowed their classification in two main classes, αREPAT and βREPAT. Studies on the transcriptional response of <b>repat</b> genes have shown that αREPAT and βREPAT differ in their sequence but also in the pattern of regulation. The αREPAT were mainly regulated in response to the Cry 1 Ca toxin from B. thuringiensis but not to the increase in the midgut microbiota load. In contrast, βREPAT were neither responding to Cry 1 Ca toxin nor to midgut microbiota. Differential expression between midgut stem cells and the whole midgut tissue was studied for the different <b>repat</b> genes revealing changes in the gene expression distribution between midgut stem cells and midgut tissue in response to midgut microbiota. This high diversity found in their sequence and in their expression profile suggests that <b>REPAT</b> proteins may be involved in multiple processes thatcould be of relevance for the understanding of the insect gut physiology...|$|E
40|$|The peritrophic matrix (PM) is {{essential}} for insect digestive system physiology as it protects the midgut epithelium from damage by food particles, pathogens, and toxins. The PM is also an attractive target for development of new pest control strategies due to its per os accessibility. To understand how the PM performs these functions, the molecular architecture of the PM was examined using genomic and proteomic approaches in Mamestra configurata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), a major pest of cruciferous oilseed crops in North America. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of the PM identified 82 proteins classified as: (i) peritrophins, including a new class with a CBDIII domain; (ii) enzymes involved in chitin modification (chitin deacetylases), digestion (serine proteases, aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, lipases and 3 ̆b 1 -amylase) or other reactions (3 ̆b 2 - 1, 3 -glucanase, alkaline phosphatase, dsRNase, astacin, pantetheinase); (iii) a heterogenous group consisting of polycalin, <b>REPATs,</b> serpin, C-Type lectin and Lsti 99 /Lsti 201 and 3 novel proteins without known orthologs. The genes encoding PM proteins were expressed predominantly in the midgut. cDNAs encoding chitin synthase- 2 (McCHS- 2), chitinase (McCHI), and 3 ̆b 2 -N-acetylglucosaminidase (McNAG) enzymes, involved in PM chitin metabolism, were also identified. McCHS- 2 expression was specific to the midgut indicating that it is responsible for chitin synthesis in the PM, the only chitinous material in the midgut. In contrast, the genes encoding the chitinolytic enzymes were expressed in multiple tissues. McCHS- 2, McCHI, and McNAG were expressed in the midgut of feeding larvae, and NAG activity was present in the PM. This information was used to generate an updated model of the lepidopteran PM architecture. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|Aim of the study. Chacacterization of {{different}} FSHD clinical subsets and/or more complex myopathic conditions among carriers of D 4 Z 4 reduced allele (DRA) associated with atypical myopathic phenotypes. Materials and methods. Out of 751 consecutive index cases {{recruited from the}} Italian National Registry for FSHD, we identified 298 myopathic patients carrying DRA with 4 - 8 <b>repats</b> who did not present obvious FSHD phenotype. Re-evaluation of clinical data and depth molecular characterization of 4 q 35 region were performed. Results. Twenty-three carriers of 4 - 8 DRA presented myopathic features related to non-FSHD conditions. In this group we observed high clinical heterogeneity. In particular subjects displayed different combinations of clinical signs that were considered atypical for FSHD: 1) involvement of muscles that are not usually affected in FSHD, 2) sparing of muscles that are typically affected in FSHD, 3) additional clinical, genetic and instrumental features that {{are not included in}} the FSHD phenotype. In addition, Molecular analysis of the 4 q 35 subtelomeric haplotype of myopathic DRA patients did not reveal any molecular element enabling us to differentiate these patients from classical FSHD patients. In two patients, heterozygous mutations were found in CAV- 3 and HSPB 3 genes. Interestingly, these patients were sporadic and no other myopathic subjects were reported in the two families. Discussion and conclusions. Our study shows that not all myopathic patients carrying 4 - 8 DRA are affected by FSHD. We conclude that in myopathic carriers of 4 q short allele who do not display a typical autosomal dominant FSHD additional molecular and clinical investigations should be performed for a more precise characterization of these patients. This approach will favor clinical diagnosis and genetic counseling...|$|R
40|$|Inactivation by allelic {{exchange}} in clinical isolates {{of the emerging}} nosocomial pathogen Enterococcus faecium has been hindered by lack of efficient tools, and, in this study, transformation of clinical isolates {{was found to be}} particularly problematic. For this reason, a vector for allelic replacement (pTEX 5500 ts) was constructed that includes (i) the pWV 01 -based gram-positive <b>repAts</b> replication region, which is known to confer a high degree of temperature intolerance, (ii) Escherichia coli oriR from pUC 18, (iii) two extended multiple-cloning sites located upstream and downstream of one of the marker genes for efficient cloning of flanking regions for double-crossover mutagenesis, (iv) transcriptional terminator sites to terminate undesired readthrough, and (v) a synthetic extended promoter region containing the cat gene for allelic exchange and a high-level gentamicin resistance gene, aph(2 ′′) -Id, to distinguish double-crossover recombination, both of which are functional in gram-positive and gram-negative backgrounds. To demonstrate the functionality of this vector, the vector was used to construct an acm (encoding an adhesin to collagen from E. faecium) deletion mutant of a poorly transformable multidrug-resistant E. faecium endocarditis isolate, TX 0082. The acm-deleted strain, TX 6051 (TX 0082 Δacm), was shown to lack Acm on its surface, which resulted in the abolishment of the collagen adherence phenotype observed in TX 0082. A mobilizable derivative (pTEX 5501 ts) that contains oriT of Tn 916 to facilitate conjugative transfer from the transformable E. faecalis strain JH 2 Sm::Tn 916 to E. faecium was also constructed. Using this vector, the acm gene of a nonelectroporable E. faecium wound isolate was successfully interrupted. Thus, pTEX 5500 ts and its mobilizable derivative demonstrated their roles as important tools by helping to create the first reported allelic replacement in E. faecium; the constructed this acm deletion mutant will be useful for assessing the role of acm in E. faecium pathogenesis using animal models...|$|R

40|$|New vectors were {{constructed}} for efficient transposon Tn 917 -mediated mutagenesis of poorly transformable strains of Streptococcus mutans(pTV 1 -OK) and subsequent recovery of interrupted genes in Escherichia coli (pT 21 delta 2 TetM). In this report, we demonstrate {{the utility of}} Tn 917 mutagenesis of a poorly transformable strain of S. mutans (JH 1005) by showing (i) the conditional replication of pTV 1 -OK, a <b>repA(Ts)</b> derivative of the broad-host-range plasmid pWVO 1 harboring Tn 9 l 7, in JH 1005 at the permissive temperature (30 degrees C) versus that at the nonpermissive temperature (45 degrees C); (ii) transposition frequencies similar to those reported for Bacillus subtilis (10 (- 5) to 10 (- 4)) with efficient plasmid curing in 90 to 97 % of the erythromycin-resistant survivors following a temperature shift to 42 to 45 degrees C; and (iii) the apparent randomness of Tn 917 insertion as determined by Southern hybridization analysis {{and the ability to}} isolate nutritional mutants, mutants in acid tolerance, and mutants in bacteriocin production, at frequencies ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 7 %. Recovery of transposon-interrupted genes was achieved by two methods: (i) marker rescue in E. coli with the recovery vector pTV 21 delta 2 TetM, a tetracycline-resistant and ampicillin-sensitive Tn 9 l 7 -pBR 322 hybrid, and (ii) "shotgun" cloning of genomic libraries of Tn 917 mutants into pUC 19. Sequence analyses revealed insertions at five different genetic loci in sequences displaying homologies to Clostridium spp. fhs (66 % identity), E. coli dfp (43 % identity), and B. subtilis ylxM-ffh (58 % identity), icd (citC [69 % identity]), and argD (61 % identity). Insertions in icd and argD caused nutritional requirements; the one in ylxM-ffh caused acid sensitivity, while those in fhs and dfp caused both acid sensitivity and nutritional requirements. This paper describes the construction of pTV 1 -OK and demonstrates that it can be efficiently employed to deliver Tn 917 into S. mutans for genetic analyses with some degree of randomness and that insertions in the chromosome can be easily recovered for subsequent characterization.

Vip proteins, which are Bacillus thuringensis (Bt) insecticidal toxins produced during the vegetative stage, are selectively effective against specific insect pests. This new group of Bt proteins represents an interesting alternative to the classical Bt Cry toxins because current data suggests {{that they do not}} share the same mode of action. We have designed and developed a genome-wide microarray for the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua, a serious lepidopteran pest of many agricultural crops, and used it to better understand how lepidopteran larvae respond to the treatment with the insecticidal protein Vip 3 Aa. With this approach, the goal of our study was to evaluate the changes in gene expression levels caused by treatment with sublethal doses of Vip 3 Aa (causing 99 % growth inhibition) at 8 and 24 h after feeding. Results indicated that the toxin provoked a wide transcriptional response, with 19 % of the microarray unigenes responding significantly to treatment. The number of up- and down-regulated unigenes was very similar. The number of genes whose expression was regulated at 8 h was similar to the number of genes whose expression was regulated after 24 h of treatment.

40|$|Bacillus thuringiensis is {{the most}} {{effective}} microbial control agent for controlling numerous species from different insect orders. The main threat for the long term use of B. thuringiensis in pest control is the ability of insects to develop resistance. Thus, the identification of insect genes involved in conferring resistance is of paramount importance. A colony of Spodoptera exigua (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) was selected for 15 years in the laboratory for resistance to Xentari (TM), a B. thuringiensis-based insecticide, reaching a final resistance level of greater than 1, 000 -fold. Around 600 midgut ESTs were analyzed by DNA-macroarray in order to find differences in midgut gene expression between susceptible and resistant insects. Among the differentially expressed genes, <b>repat</b> and arylphorin were identified and their increased expression was correlated with B. thuringiensis resistance. We also found overlap among genes that were constitutively over-expressed in resistant insects with genes that were up-regulated in susceptible insects after exposure to Xentari (TM), suggesting a permanent activation of the response to Xentari (TM) in resistant insects. Increased aminopeptidase activity in the lumen of resistant insects in the absence of exposure to Xentari (TM) corroborated the hypothesis of permanent activation of response genes. Increase in midgut proliferation has been proposed as a mechanism of response to pathogens in the adult from several insect species. Analysis of S. exigua larvae revealed that midgut proliferation was neither increased in resistant insects nor induced by exposure of susceptible larvae to Xentari (TM), suggesting that mechanisms other than midgut proliferation are involved in the response to B. thuringiensis by S. exigua larvae...|$|E
