5|$|Grant was {{vigorous}} in his {{enforcement of}} the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina. He proactively used military and Justice Department enforcement of civil <b>rights</b> <b>laws</b> {{and the protection of}} African Americans more than any other 19th century president. He used his full powers to weaken the Ku Klux Klan, reducing violence and intimidation in the South. He appointed James Milton Turner as the first African American minister to a foreign nation. Grant's relationship with Charles Sumner, the leader in promoting civil rights, was shattered by the Senator's opposition to Grant's plan to acquire Santo Domingo by treaty. Grant retaliated, firing men Sumner had recommended and having allies strip Sumner of his chairmanship of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.|$|E

It argues that transnational corporations require specialized and targeted regulations and laws, and that the conflation of human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> should be reversed to allow the advancement of other forms of human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> It makes two proposals. First, reimagine human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> as separate categories. Specifically, classify international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> as a sub-category of human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> This distinction highlights the need to encourage the development of other forms of human <b>rights</b> <b>law,</b> for example, global human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and national human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> Second, establish global human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> as a sub-category of human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and create a new global human rights regime with three main elements: a Global Law Commission, global laws and regulations, and universal civil jurisdiction...|$|R
40|$|Children’s <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> {{is often}} studied and {{perceived}} {{in isolation from}} the broader field of human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> This volume explores the inter-relationship between children’s <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and more general human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> {{in order to see}} whether elements from each could successfully inform the other. Children’s <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> has a number of distinctive characteristics, such as the emphasis on the ‘best interests of the child’, the use of general principles, and the inclusion of ‘third parties’ (e. g. parents and other care-takers) in treaty provisions. The first part of this book questions whether these features could be a source of inspiration for general human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> In part two, the reverse question is asked: could children’s <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> draw inspiration from developments in other branches of human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> that focus on other specific categories of rights holders, such as women, persons with disabilities, indigenous peoples, or older persons? Finally, the interaction between children’s <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> – and the potential for their isolation, inspiration or integration – may be coloured or determined by the thematic issue under consideration. Therefore the third part of the book studies the interplay between children’s <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> in the context of specific topics: intra-family relations, LGBTQI marginalization, migration, media, the environment and transnational human rights obligations...|$|R

5|$|Hayes {{appointed}} two Associate Justices to the Supreme Court. The first vacancy {{occurred when}} David Davis resigned {{to enter the}} Senate during the election controversy of 1876. On taking office, Hayes appointed John Marshall Harlan to the seat. A former candidate for governor of Kentucky, Harlan had been Benjamin Bristow's campaign manager at the 1876 Republican convention, and Hayes had earlier considered him for Attorney General. Hayes submitted the nomination in October 1877, but it aroused some dissent in the Senate because of Harlan's limited experience in public office. Harlan was nonetheless confirmed and served on the court for thirty-four years, in which he voted (usually in the minority) for an aggressive enforcement of the civil <b>rights</b> <b>laws.</b> In 1880, a second seat became vacant upon the resignation of Justice William Strong. Hayes nominated William Burnham Woods, a carpetbagger Republican circuit court judge from Alabama. Woods served six years on the Court, ultimately proving a disappointment to Hayes as he interpreted the Constitution in a manner more {{similar to that of}} Southern Democrats than to Hayes's own preferences.|$|E

It sees rights as they apply to the individual, with regard to the individual’s particular abilities, needs, and circumstances. Disability Human <b>Rights</b> <b>Law</b> represents a shift in the field of human rights. The traditional, and often archaic, rights boundaries are broken down. Civil and political rights exist entwined with social, economic, and cultural rights. The rights of the community and the rights of the individual are not always distinguishable and are often dependent upon one another. The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is the epitome of this shift and the epicenter of a new wave of rights protection. This book focuses on this new field.

40|$|Although {{collective}} {{cultural rights}} {{are included in}} international human <b>rights</b> <b>law,</b> their precise place and their nature and significance are not well-explored or understood. This paper aims to show where collective cultural rights {{can be found in}} international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and explore how these rights fit in the general body and framework of international human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> The starting point in this chapter is international human <b>rights</b> <b>law,</b> which implies that the analysis of collective cultural rights is framed by positive law and international legal instruments, such as treaties and conventions, as well as by soft law instruments, such as declarations, recommendations and resolutions. In this paper, the two categories of collective rights and cultural rights are defined, drawing a distinction between a) different types of collective rights, including rights for collectivities as such, rights for individuals as members of collectivities, and rights with a collective interest or object; and b) between different types of cultural rights, including rights that explicitly refer to ‘culture’ and rights that relate to culture or have a cultural dimension. This paper furthermore analyses various contentious issues surrounding collective rights and cultural rights in international human <b>rights</b> <b>law,</b> including the lack of clarity on the object and subject of these rights. The paper then outlines the different forms of collective cultural rights in international human <b>rights</b> <b>law,</b> by providing examples of legal provisions in international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> that can be classified as collective cultural rights. Finally, the paper elaborates on how collective subjects and collective cultural interests are integrated in international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> and analyses how and to what extent collective cultural rights provisions provide answers to the above-noted issues...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{theory of}} interpretation for human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> must answer {{two kinds of}} questions. First: Who should interpret international human <b>rights</b> <b>law?</b> Second: What principles should guide the interpretation of human <b>rights</b> <b>law?</b> Individual governments frequently claim the right to interpret international law {{as it applies to}} them, but this claim is contested by many United Nations subgroups and by nongovernmental organizations like Amnesty International. I argue that international institutions are more likely to give a fair hearing to people's human rights than are their own governments. Accordingly, we can conclude as a general rule that international institutions should be assigned authority to interpret international human <b>rights</b> <b>law.</b> The general rule has an exception, however. Democratic states that protect basic freedoms of speech and assembly will promote and protect their own citizens' human rights better than undemocratic states. Moreover, free democratic states, by giving a voice to all citizens, can take advantage of local knowledge about particular human rights problems and solutions, and so are more likely than international institutions to interpret human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> with a sensitivity to the human rights of all citizens and to the locally important human rights issues. Therefore, unlike other states, liberal democratic states should have the authority to interpret international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> as it applies within their borders. What principles should guide the interpretation of human <b>rights</b> <b>law?</b> The answer depends on whether we take a short- or long-term perspective. Currently, the institutions of international law are relatively ineffective when compared to most domestic legal systems. While this remains the case, a principle allowing interpreters to use their judgment about moral human rights in interpreting human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> can be justified {{on the basis of the}} contribution this would make to global deliberation about the proper understanding of moral human rights. As human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> develops more effective, less voluntaristic institutions, this principle of interpretation should be phased out...|$|R
40|$|The study {{primarily}} aims {{to address}} the legal consequences {{of the rise of}} responsible mining and responsible mining itself to international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> in regulating the mining industry. Firstly, the thesis describes the rise of responsible mining in the context of considerable power of the industry and mining companies. Secondly, the thesis explains how international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> governs the mining industry and whereabouts responsible mining could be in the system. Thirdly, the thesis questions the legal basis for responsible mining under international human <b>rights</b> <b>law,</b> and then examines possibilities that responsible mining could violate core provisions of international human <b>rights</b> <b>law</b> in regulating the mining industry.
