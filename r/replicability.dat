5|$|Despite selling no advance {{copies in}} America, Summerhill brought Neill {{significant}} renown {{in the next}} decade, wherein he sold three million copies. The book was used in hundreds of college courses and translated into languages such as German. Reviewers noted Neill's charismatic personality, but doubted the project's general <b>replicability</b> elsewhere and its overstated generalizations. They put Neill in a lineage of experimental thought, but questioned his lasting contribution to psychology. The book begat an American Summerhillian following, cornered an education criticism market, and made Neill into a folk leader.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that {{is complicated by the}} complexity of the metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure <b>replicability</b> and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|The {{variety of}} {{positivism}} that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism. This approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns (such as {{the nature of}} social facts) in favour of methodological clarity, <b>replicability,</b> reliability and validity. This positivism {{is more or less}} synonymous with quantitative research, and so only resembles older positivism in practice. Since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment, its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought. Modern sociology of this type is often credited to Paul Lazarsfeld, who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them. This approach lends itself to what Robert K. Merton called middle-range theory: abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole.|$|E
25|$|The <b>replicability</b> and {{interpretation}} of goal-priming findings has become controversial. Recent studies have failed to replicate findings, including age priming, with additional reports of failure to replicate this and other findings such as social-distance also reported.|$|E
500|$|Multiple reviewers {{stressed}} the school's reliance on Neill as a charismatic figure, which begat doubts of the institution's general <b>replicability.</b> Sarah Crutis (The Times Literary Supplement) asked whether teachers {{would have the}} [...] "time, patience, and personality" [...] to use Neill's methods. [...] "Their extremes of endurance may sometimes sound masochistic", wrote D. W. Harding (New Statesman), and Richard E. Gross (The Social Studies) added that Neill's [...] "extremes ... go far beyond good sense". Danica Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) concluded that the school's lessons curbed the child's sense of social responsibility and other society-preserving functions. Jacob Hechler (Child Welfare) said that what Neill described as love—a combination of [...] "caring and noninterference"—was very hard to bring to bear. The New Yorker called Neill [...] "a fiery crusader" [...] with [...] "deep understanding of children", and Morris Fritz Mayer (Social Service Review) read Neill as having the [...] "wrath and eloquence of a biblical prophet" [...] with a belief in children and [...] "unyielding attack against pathological and phony values in education" [...] that [...] "one cannot help admiring". Willard W. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) positioned Neill as closer to a psychotherapist than a teacher, especially as the philosophy undergirding Summerhill [...] "derives from Freud". Gene Phillips (The Annals of the American Academy) described Neill as the [...] "essential ingredient of the democratic ethic that ... America needs".|$|E
2500|$|The {{philosophy}} and techniques of Antigonish anticipated {{some of the}} key ideas of rural development, including the emancipatory pedagogy of Paulo Freire, and the philosophy of Robert Chambers/participatory rural assessment. [...] However, the Antigonish approach runs into significant problems in oral communities and those with anti-democratic traditions. [...] This has limited the <b>replicability</b> of the movement, and led to significant offshoots, such as the self-help group movement in India, village banking and the ASCA movement in parts of Africa.|$|E
2500|$|The {{numerous}} {{criticisms of}} significance testing do {{not lead to}} a single alternative. A unifying position of critics is that statistics should {{not lead to a}} conclusion or a decision but to a probability or to an estimated value with a confidence interval rather than to an accept-reject decision regarding a particular hypothesis. It is unlikely that the controversy surrounding significance testing will be resolved in the near future. Its supposed flaws and unpopularity do not eliminate the need for an objective and transparent means of reaching conclusions regarding studies that produce statistical results. Critics have not unified around an alternative. Other forms of reporting confidence or uncertainty could probably grow in popularity. One strong critic of significance testing suggested a list of reporting alternatives: effect sizes for importance, prediction intervals for confidence, replications and extensions for <b>replicability,</b> meta-analyses for generality. None of these suggested alternatives produces a conclusion/decision. Lehmann said that hypothesis testing theory can be presented in terms of conclusions/decisions, probabilities, or confidence intervals. [...] "The distinction between the ... approaches is largely one of reporting and interpretation." ...|$|E

50|$|Caravanserais {{dotted the}} major trade routes across the region, placed at {{intervals}} of a day's travel. The construction of these caravanserai inns improved in scale, fortification, and <b>replicability.</b> Also, {{they began to}} contain central mosques.|$|E

5000|$|Grounded theory {{focuses on}} a quasi {{objective}} centered researcher {{with an emphasis on}} hypotheses, variables, reliability and <b>replicability.</b> This is contradictory with the more away from this more quantitative form of terminology in recent qualitative research approaches.|$|E
50|$|Since 2002, the {{financial}} resources allocated to the Ministry of Energy and Water follow a three-year program budget, focusing on a unification of all funding (operational and investment costs) and a better <b>replicability</b> of the expenditures and its impacts.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, the American Economic Review {{instituted a}} {{mandatory}} archive for the {{submission of data}} and code used in economic journal submissions to ensure the <b>replicability</b> and legitimacy of research. An analysis of the Journal of Money, Credit and Bankings archive from 1996-2003 found that only 14 of 186 empirical articles could be replicated. Some economists have published suggestions regarding procedures to ensure the <b>replicability</b> of journal articles. As a result, the journals editors amended their procedures beginning with the December 2006 issue. The amendments did not render the desired outcomes. In the December 2006 issue, only 2 of 9 empirical articles had data and code in the archive, neither of which could reproduce the published results.|$|E
5000|$|Objectivity in {{statistics}} {{is often}} confused with truth whereas {{it is better}} understood as <b>replicability,</b> which then needs to be defined in the particular case. Theodore Porter develops this as being the path pursued when trust has evaporated, being replaced with criteria.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Replicability</b> - Even {{the largest}} test {{market is not}} totally {{representative}} of the national market, and the smaller ones may introduce gross distortions. Test market results therefore have {{to be treated with}} reservations, {{in exactly the same way}} as other market research.|$|E
50|$|Reproducibility is {{the ability}} of an entire {{analysis}} of an experiment or study to be duplicated, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently, whereas reproducing an experiment is called replicating it. Reproducibility and <b>replicability</b> together are among the main principles of the scientific method.|$|E
5000|$|Pashler is {{also known}} for {{influential}} critiques of methodological and statistical practices in behavioral science. His critiques have focused on statistical and logical issues in neuroimaging research ("voodoo correlations"), educational psychology (learning styles concept) [...] testing of mathematical models, and the <b>replicability</b> of “behavioral priming” {{research in the field}} of social psychology.|$|E
50|$|Main {{concerns}} in experimental design include {{the establishment of}} validity, reliability, and <b>replicability.</b> For example, these concerns can be partially addressed by carefully choosing the predictor, {{reducing the risk of}} measurement error, and ensuring that the documentation of the method is sufficiently detailed. Related {{concerns in}}clude achieving appropriate levels of statistical power and sensitivity.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016 the Zebras Urban Educators Program, which celebrated 15 {{years of}} action, won the Guangzhou International Award for Urban Innovation in China {{because of the}} ease of <b>replicability</b> {{of the project and}} its dual function: {{educational}} and social. On the other hand, they also took the title of the Most Voted City Online.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the criticisms}} of p-rep {{is the fact}} that while it {{attempts}} to estimate <b>replicability,</b> it ignores results from other studies which can accurately guide this estimate. For example, an experiment on some unlikely paranormal phenomenon may yield a p-rep of 0.75. Most people would still not conclude the probability of a replication was 75%. Rather, they would conclude it is much closer to 0: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and p-rep ignores this. Because of this, p-rep may in fact be harder to interpret than a classical p-value. The fact that p-rep requires assumptions about prior probabilities for it to be valid makes its interpretation complex. Killeen argues that new results should be evaluated in their own right, without the [...] "burden of history", with flat priors: that is what p-rep yields. A more pragmatic estimate of <b>replicability</b> would include prior knowledge, via, for instance, meta-analysis.|$|E
50|$|According to {{researchers}} Andrew Guth, Robyn Anderson, Kasey Kinnard and Hang Tran, {{they feel the}} Index's methods reveal weaknesses and they raise questions about its <b>replicability</b> and validity. They claim that the publicity given to the Index is leading {{to the use of}} its data in popular culture, reputable magazines, by news outlets, by academic journals and top policy makers.|$|E
50|$|A further {{criticism}} of the p-rep statistic involves the logic of experimentation. The scientific value of replicable data lies in the adequate accounting for previously unmeasured factors (including, for instance unmeasured participant variables, experimenter's bias, etc. The idea that a single study can capture a logical likelihood of such unmeasured factors affecting the outcome, and thus the likelihood of <b>replicability,</b> is a logical fallacy.|$|E
50|$|The {{replication}} crisis (or <b>replicability</b> crisis) {{refers to}} a methodological crisis in science in which scientists {{have found that the}} results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate on subsequent investigation, either by independent researchers or by the original researchers themselves. While the crisis has long-standing roots, the phrase was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem.|$|E
50|$|In bioarchaeology, osteometry is {{very useful}} to solve many anthropological {{problems}} about past human populations, for example, {{it may be}} used to determine kinship, sex, the degree of sex dimorphism (which {{may be used to}} answer questions related to lack of nutrition) and even ethnicity.There are many problems around the interpretation of osteometric data: loose <b>replicability</b> of the measurements, problems relative to the phenotypic variations between subpopulations of one species, etcetera.|$|E
50|$|The {{index is}} controversial. According to {{researchers}} Andrew Guth, Robyn Anderson, Kasey Kinnard, and Hang Tran, {{an analysis of}} the index's methods reveals significant and critical weaknesses and raises questions about its <b>replicability</b> and validity. Moreover, the publicity given to the index is leading to the use of its poor data not only by popular culture and reputable magazines and news outlets but also by academic journals and top policy makers.|$|E
5000|$|Althea Nagai, {{who works}} as a {{research}} fellow at the conservative Center for Equal Opportunity, accuses microaggression research of being pseudoscience. Nagai asserts that the prominent critical race researchers behind microaggression theory [...] "reject the methodology and standards of modern science." [...] She lists various technical shortcomings of microaggression research, including [...] "biased interview questions, reliance on narrative and small numbers of respondents, problems of reliability, issues of <b>replicability,</b> and ignoring alternative explanations." ...|$|E
50|$|Based on {{coursework}} {{in experimental}} methods at MIT and Stanford, {{it has been}} suggested that methods courses in psychology emphasize replication attempts rather than original studies. Such an approach would help students learn scientific methodology and provide numerous independent replications of meaningful scientific findings that would test the <b>replicability</b> of scientific findings. Some have recommended that graduate students should be required to publish a high-quality replication attempt on a topic related to their doctoral research prior to graduation.|$|E

5000|$|Numerous {{technologies}} {{are available for}} the production of nanotopography. High-throughput techniques include plasma functionalization, abrasive blasting, and etching. Though low cost, these processes are limited in the control and <b>replicability</b> of feature size and geometry. [...] Techniques enabling greater feature precision exist, among them electron beam lithography and particle deposition, but are slower and more resource intensive by comparison. Alternatively, processes such as molecular self-assembly can be utilized which provide an enhanced level of production speed and feature control.|$|E
50|$|Enrichment only becomes {{effective}} where, by Liebig's law, {{carbon dioxide}} {{has become the}} limiting factor. In a controlled greenhouse, irrigation may be trivial, and soils may be fertile by default. In less-controlled gardens and open fields, rising CO2 levels only increase primary production {{to the point of}} soil depletion (assuming no droughts, flooding, or both), as demonstrated prima facie by CO2 levels continuing to rise. In addition, laboratory experiments, free air carbon enrichment (FACE) test plots, and field measurements provide <b>replicability.</b>|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the nature}} of the weapons effect, it is {{impossible}} to directly test the original hypothesis in a real-world setting. While the attempts at replicating or even finding a weapons effect may be performed flawlessly, that does not necessarily mean that the results of these studies is applicable in the real world. It is important to note that an effect may have been found in many of these studies, but further research is necessary to determine the validity and <b>replicability</b> of these results.|$|E
50|$|Methodological {{economic}} and statistical {{elements of the}} subject include measurement, collection, analysis, and publication of data. 'Economic statistics' may also refer to a subtopic of official statistics produced by official organizations (e.g. statistical institutes, intergovernmental organizations such as United Nations, European Union or OECD, central banks, ministries, etc.). Economic data provide an empirical basis for economic research, whether descriptive or econometric. Data archives are also a key input for assessing the <b>replicability</b> of empirical findings and for use in decision making as to economic policy.|$|E
5000|$|Moravcsik advocates greater {{transparency}} and <b>replicability</b> of textual, qualitative and historical research in international relations, political science, {{and the social}} sciences more generally. To this end, he has proposed the use of [...] "active citation" [...] the use of precise footnotes hyperlinked to source material contained in an appendix or on a permanent qualitative data repository. He is currently working with other scholars to realize this proposal. However, Moravcsik himself has been criticized for imprecise and misleading use of historical sources in The Choice for Europe.|$|E
