All the simulations were performed with the implicit finite element code Forge 2009 ® with user input written in Visual Fortran®. Alloys AA 2024 and AA 6063 were utilised as the source materials in order to compare with published experimental work. The Forge 2009 ® 2 D module was used to investigate both direct and indirect axisymmetric <b>rod</b> <b>extrusions.</b> The extrusion load and the temperature rise were predicted and the load-displacement curves and the events {{that took place in}} both extrusion modes were also simulated, discussed and again verified. The effects of {{the difference between the two}} modes, especially friction and its consequences on the process were investigated. The indirect results point to a good method of improving efficiency. For complex solid section, the 3 D module has been used to study the load required, temperature evolution, surface formation of the extrudate and material flow during the process. These all showed good correlation with experimental results. The microstructure evolution during the extrusion process and the following solution soaking process were simulated with physically-based mathematical microstructure models integrated into FEM through its Fortran® subroutine interface,. The agreement between the predicted microstructures using associated models and experimental measurements were acceptable.

40|$|Cold {{extrusion}} is {{a process}} commonly used to manufacture drive train components in the automotive industry. Large plastic strains can be applied during this operation (up to 1. 5) and greatly changes the mechanical properties of the resulting material. This study focuses {{on the impact of}} cold extrusion process parameters on the multiaxial fatigue behaviour of steel components. A specific set of forward <b>rod</b> <b>extrusion</b> tools was developed to get original fatigue specimen able to characterise the effect of the manufacturing process on the fatigue behaviour. The specimens were extruded from two different initial diameters, giving two different reductions in cross-section of 18 % and 75 % respectively. To understand the influence of cold extrusion, the following analyses have been undertaken for each condition and on the initial material: monotonic tensile properties, microstructure, EBSD, residual stresses and hardness. Simulation of the forming process and microstructural observations show that the plastic strain is homogeneous in the specimen section. For both reduction factors, the forming process has a positive effect on the components properties: induced residual stresses in compression and improved hardness and roughness (Ra decreasing). Tension, plane bending and torsion fatigue tests show that the fatigue strength is about 30 % higher for the batch with 75 % reduced cross-section. All investigations show that strain hardening is the principal material parameter responsible for the increase in fatigue strength. A multiaxial fatigue criterion taking into account the effects of the forward <b>rod</b> <b>extrusion</b> process was also developed. This work has been performed within the ANR (National Research Agency) DEFISURF project, in a partnership including several industrial (Ascometal, Cetim, PSA, Transvalor, Atelier des Janves, Gévelot) and academic (INSA Lyon MATEIS, ENSMP-CEMEF, Arts et Métiers ParisTech LAMPA) institutions...|$|E

For hot extrusion, {{two different types}} of extrusion dies, a conventional flat-face die and an experimental die, are used. The experimental die combines the process of equal channel angular pressing with the process of hot extrusion in a single die, which increases the strain and pressure affecting the chips during extrusion, both critical factors for achieving sound chip bonding. Subsequently, the chip-based extrudates are machined to fabricate chip-based preforms for the cold extrusion experiments.

Several types of tubing impact-extruded by ALCOA were tested. The stronger tabing (M 655) failed very rapidly. The weaker tubing suffered extensive localized surface attack and penetration of the corrosion attack along the extrusion direction after prolonged (approximates 3 months) exposure to 290 deg C water. A precorrosion heat treatment was effective in reducing both types of attack on the weaker tubing. Armour Research Foundation supplied several types of tubing extraded through a bridge die. All tubes failed on prolonged (approximates 8 months) corrosion in 290 deg C water at the longitudinal bond lines. These lines were formed by the rejoining of the metal streams passing over the mandrel supports in the die during extrusion. Directly extruded tubing supplied by the Torrance Brass Company also failed on extended exposure to 290 deg C water.

40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the analysis of plastic deformation of bimetal co-extrusion process. Extrusion is related to large deformation of material and leads to non-homogeneous deformation within work-piece material. The mechanism of plastic deformation during the composite <b>rod</b> <b>extrusion</b> is much more complicated than that in single metal extrusion. Deformation patterns of co-extrusion of two different materials are characterized by several process parameters. In this paper, the analysis is focused to investigate the effect of contact conditions along the interface between two different materials. The rigid-plastic finite element method was applied to the analysis of co-extrusion process. The selected materials are AA 1100 aluminum alloy as hard material and CDA 110 as soft one. This type of material selection was to examine the effect of hard core and soft sleeve and vice versa in terms of deformation pattern. The initial composite billets were prepared by inserting the core material in tight (0. 023 mm) and weak (0. 012 mm) interference bonding, respectively. Four different cases of co-extrusion process in terms of material combination and interference bonding were simulated to investigate the effect of material arrangement between core and sleeve, and of bonding on the plastic zones. It is concluded from the simulation results that the plastic zones in this co-extrusion process are not influenced much by the selection of material arrangements or bonding condition between construction materials. However, it was seen from the simulation results that the extrusion ratio of each construction material, i. e. homogeneity of co-extrusion, depends much on the material arrangement and the bonding condition...|$|E

Traditionally, stents are made of inert materials such as stainless steel and titanium alloys. It {{has been shown that}} the traditional stents can cause restenosis or thrombosis. In recent years the proposal of biodegradable stents is attracting the interest of the industry and the research, since the stent is mechanically needed only in the first year, eliminating the problems caused by the long duration of the implant. Magnesium (Mg) alloys are of increasing interest because of their engineering properties, including the high strength to density ratio. Recently, they have been also proposed as biomaterials for the production of bioabsorbable stents and for other medical devices due to its harmless effect to human body when compared with other structural materials. In this work, the possibility to produce biodegradable stents made of magnesium starting from the powder is investigated. Pure Mg and the AZ 91 Mg powders were used in the present study. Pure Mg powder was sintered by Spark Plasma Sintering at 400 and 470 °C, and the AZ 91 powder was sintered at 400 °C without homogenization and at 470 °C after homogenization. The preforms produced by sintering were then submitted to hot compression, <b>rod</b> <b>extrusion</b> and tube extrusion at 330 and 380 °C with different strain rates. During all the process was not possible to obtain recrystallization or grain refinement on pure Mg, and after the tube extrusion it has shown a high brittleness and sever defects, which led to the decision of proceed only with AZ 91 alloy. The AZ 91 presented good recrystallization in al process, always following the Zener-Hollomon relation. The grain size obtained was as small as 1. 5 μm. The AZ 91 tube was then submitted to manual machining and laser cutting and it was possible to obtain the stent precursors. The results of the present investigation have demonstrated the suitability of the proposed route for producing Mg-based stents.

40|$|The {{aluminium}} extrusion process {{is based on}} simple principles, but allows profiles with the most complex cross-sectional shapes to be produced {{at a very high}} rate. One of the greatest challenges of {{aluminium extrusion}} is to control material flow and dimensional variability of thin-walled high-strength profiles, for which the demand is growing. The die outlet geometry and the temperatures of the billet and tools must be carefully tuned in order to secure satisfactory material flow conditions. Due to the high pressures in the container, the deformation of the extrusion dies and the distortion of the die outlet may be significant and must be compensated for. The thermal conditions in the extrusion press must also be controlled. Even in the age of numerical modelling much trial and error is needed to make certain that the product satisfies the customer requirements. If simple and effective process control could be implemented, the cost and dimensional variability of extruded profiles could be significantly reduced. This would not only secure the continued use of extruded profiles in old markets but also open new ones. The main objective of this study has been to establish useful and simple methods for measuring the pressure at the interface between the die and the billet and the deformation of the die during hot extrusion of aluminium. Pressure measurement data may be used to establish {{a better understanding of the}} extrusion process and to carefully evaluate the many numerical extrusion models that are presently being developed and refined for the purpose of predicting profile shape and properties. A most important task is the evaluation of constitutive models used to describe bulk material and friction behaviour. The requirements for such models should be viewed in relation to common flow instability phenomena such as buckling. Sensors may in the future be integrated in intelligent extrusion dies in order to make certain that temperature and flow condition changes are as small as possible and to prevent overloading of extrusion dies during production. It is of the utmost importance that dimensional variability is detected early. This study has consisted of many parts. The first step was a careful evaluation of sensor designs using the Capacitec HPC- 75 high-temperature capacitive displacement probes and the Capacitec 4004 amplifier series. The feasibility of high- and low-temperature pressure measurement was demonstrated through various types of compression testing. The capacitive sensors were repeatedly tested in a hot air furnace to 650 ºC, and results were satisfactory for all but one of the sensors. The sensor sensitivity to temperature changes that occur during extrusion is usually less than 10 % of the full sensor response. The pressure sensors have been repeatedly tested in several dies for aluminium <b>rod</b> <b>extrusion.</b> The feasibility of, and a method for, performing useful measurements in the high-temperature extrusion environment have been demonstrated. The measurement accuracy is better than ± 10 % of full scale of 200 MPa when the effects of temperature changes are compensated for. The measurement repeatability is of a similar magnitude for genuinely replicated measurements. The measurement resolution is better than 1 %. It is firmly believed that the measurement and calibration technology may be further improved, and that the measurement accuracy may be better than 5 % of full scale. <b>Rod</b> <b>extrusion</b> experiments allowed the quality of the finite element modelling approach to be evaluated. The code ALMA 2 π was used, and material data of the Zener-Hollomon flow rule have been obtained by compression testing. Simulated and measured results of the ram force, die face pressure and liner force generally differed less than 10 %. The estimated die outlet temperature change was systematically 10 ºC too high. As there are significant differences between extrusion and compression testing, the use of material data from compression testing amounts to an extrapolation of data. Experiments did not demonstrate that the approach is unacceptable, but plots showing the deviation between experimental and estimated ram force and outlet temperature data indicated that there are a number of parameter combinations that are equally good as or even better than those obtained through compression testing. Very high accuracy determination of flow parameters may be difficult. Measurement errors significantly complicate matters. The pressure sensors may be used to study practical extrusion problems and to establish a better understanding of metal flow and the significance of die deformation. Thin strip extrusion experiments were performed to gain insight into the thermo-mechanics of flow instability (buckling). The feasibility of performing pressure measurement during the extrusion of thin strips was demonstrated, but sensors were not properly calibrated. The first round of the experiments was run with a die outlet 78. 5 mm wide and 1. 7 mm thick, and a container diameter of 100 mm. During extrusion of AA 6060 flow instability phenomena were not encountered. A second round of experiments was performed with non-instrumented dies and somewhat thinner profiles (1. 1 and 1. 4 mm). Flow instability in the form of buckling was provoked for high outlet temperatures, and many replicate experiments were performed. The shape of the buckled thin strip was also measured continuously with a laser triangulation technique during extrusion at high speed. Due to limitations related to the experimental set-up, neither the resolution nor the accuracy of the approach was entirely satisfactory. Nonetheless, the feasibility of the approach was demonstrated, and it is quite possible to improve the measurement technique. Capacitive pressure measurement techniques have been combined with methods for measuring the deformation of the mandrel and the straining of the bridges to study the behaviour of dies during tube extrusion. Capacitec capacitive probes were used to measure bridge strains. High temperature Kyowa strain gauges were also used for the same purpose. The die mandrel deflection was measured by conventional displacement transducers connected to the mandrel and the die cap by rods. Only measurements by the capacitive sensors proved sufficiently reliable during measurements. The study revealed that the state of stress in dies for hollow profiles may be very close to critical. The die face pressure at the top face of the mandrel exceeded 500 MPa. Two rounds of industrial experiments were performed with a U-profile that proved most difficult to extrude. In the first round of experiments, the flow stability was not satisfactory, and plugging of the outlet ruined experiments. The second round was more successful, and sensors were used to record the die face pressure on-line. The experiments demonstrated the feasibility of industrial experiments, but clearly indicated that further development of the sensors should be performed. It is important that sensors are made more durable, and that calibration techniques are further developed. Practical die designs that allow simple integration of sensors in the press should be developed. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

Metallic Fe and SrO precipitate from the perovskite lattice as rods of several tenths of nm and thicknesses up to 20 nm. Based on a model of Fe whisker growth following reduction of pure iron oxides, Fe rod exsolution from LSF proceeds via rate-limiting lattice oxygen removal. This favors the formation of single iron metal nuclei at the perovskite surface, subsequently growing as isolated rods. The latter is only possible upon efficient removal of reduction-induced water and, subsequently, reduction of Fe +III/+IV to Fe(0). If water remains in the system, no reduction or rod formation occurs. In contrast, formation of SrO rods following reduction in dry hydrogen is a catalytic process aided by Ni particles. It bears significant resemblance to surface diffusion-controlled carbon whisker growth on Ni, leading to similar <b>extrusion</b> <b>rods</b> and filaments. In addition to SrO rod growth, the exsolution of Fe nanoparticles and, subsequently, Ni–Fe alloy particles is observed. The latter have also been observed under static hydrogen reduction.

The reported values for Am- 241 are (1. 3 plus or minus 0. 2) in oven C and less than 400 ng in oven D. Our results indicate an upper limit of U- 235 content of 0. 2 g for oven C and (0. 105 plus or minus 0. 048) g in oven D. This report discusses the methodology, non-destructive assay (NDA) measurements, and results of the holdup measured {{for each of the three}} actinide species in these out-gassing ovens...|$|R
