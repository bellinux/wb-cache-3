The quenching efficiency {{was found to be}} much higher in vesicles in the liquid-crystalline phase with respect to the gel phase, by a factor of about 50. Since the oxygen solubility in the two phospholipid phases can differ at most by a factor of 4 based on literature values, we concluded that oxygen diffusion must be responsible for the great difference in the quenching efficiency. A relatively high quenching efficiency was also found in vesicles composed of equimolar gel and liquid-crystalline phospholipids. Simulations were performed using the linear superposition of the properties of the pure phases to demonstrate that, in the case of vesicles composed of coexisting phases, the diffusional properties of oxygen in each phase are largely modified by the presence of the other. The addition of 10 mol% cholesterol to the gel phase rendered Laurdan fluorescence approximately as quenchable as in the equimolar mixture of the two phases.

In a previous investigation of the bainite reaction in a Fe- 3. 9 Si- 0. 9 C steel the transformation {{was considered to be}} the result of two competing elementary mechanisms, i. e., the shear transformation of the y-iron lattice and the diffusion of interstitial carbon away from the transformation interface. According to this model, the transition from upper to lower bainite occurs when the rate of interstitial carbon traversing the y/a interface becomes of the same order with the velocity of the shear front. This interpretation stipulates that the carbon content corresponding to the y/a and To curves of austenite is critical. Using step <b>quench</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> determining the percentage of the residual austenite and its carbon content it was demonstrated that both and XT" contents of austenite play an important role in the initiation of its decomposition and its incomplete transformation. In this paper, the microstructural and crystallographic characteristics of the bainite products obtained through the step <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> are examined, using TEM and Electron diffraction. The results are compared to those obtained by the corresponding bainitic transfonnation in a single step.

Glycopeptide antibiotics such as vanco-mycin and teicoplanin are clinically important for the treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections. StaL is a 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phosphosulfate-dependent sulfotransferase capable of sulfating the cross-linked heptapeptide substrate both in vivo and in vitro, yielding the product A 47934, a unique teicoplanin-class glycopeptide antibiotic. The sulfonation reaction catalyzed by StaL constitutes the final step in A 47934 biosynthesis. Here we report the crystal structure of StaL and its complex with the cofactor product 3 '-phosphoadenosine 5 '-phosphate. This is only the second prokaryotic sulfotransferase to be structurally characterized.

Photoreactions competing with OCPR were hydrogen atom abstraction from solvent by the C- 2 of the DCNA and, in characteristically favourable cases only, 3, 4 -C-C bond cleavage. In cases of low OCPR quantum yields, hydrogen abstraction from solvent was dominant in cyclohexane or methanol but it could be suppressed by the choice of a solvent (methylene chloride, acetonitrile, tert- butanol) that more strongly resisted hydrogen abstraction. Further minor by-products were isomeric DCNA and 1, 1 -dicyano- 3 -alkenes. No carbene-derived products were observed. Supplementary <b>experiments</b> included <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> an investigation of the DCNA triplet state. The DCNA triplet state was formed at only ca. 1 % on direct irradiation but it could be efficiently produced by sensitisation with benzophenone; in the absence of olefins as inter- or intramolecular substrates, it was fairly unreactive. All observed reactions occur from the lowest excited DCNA singlet state. According to the <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments,</b> this state is short-lived as compared to diffusional movements. Other than OCPR which appears to be due to cationic reactivity at C- 2 exhibited by the perpendicular geometry of the excited double bond, hydrogen abstraction and 3, 4 -C-C bond cleavage appear to be due to radical reactivity at C- 2 exhibited by geometries of the excited double bond that are intermediate between planar and perpendicular and are due to vibration about the perpendicular conformation.

40|$|Increased {{conformational}} {{flexibility is}} the prevailing {{explanation for the}} high catalytic efficiency of cold-adapted enzymes at low temperatures. However, less {{is known about the}} structural determinants of flexibility. We reported two novel cold-adapted zinc metalloproteases in the thermolysin family, vibriolysin MCP- 02 from a deep sea bacterium and vibriolysin E 495 from an Arctic sea ice bacterium, and compared them with their mesophilic homolog, pseudolysin from a terrestrial bacterium. Their catalytic efficiencies, kcat/Km (10 – 40 °C), followed the order pseudolysin < MCP- 02 < E 495 with a ratio of ∼ 1 : 2 : 4. MCP- 02 and E 495 have the same optimal temperature (Topt, 57 °C, 5 °C lower than pseudolysin) and apparent melting temperature (Tm = 64 °C, ∼ 10 °C lower than pseudolysin). Structural analysis showed that the slightly lower stabilities resulted from a {{decrease in the number of}} salt bridges. Fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> molecular dynamics simulations showed that the flexibilities of the proteins were pseudolysin < MCP- 02 < E 495, suggesting that optimization of flexibility is a strategy for cold adaptation. Molecular dynamics results showed that the ordinal increase in flexibility from pseudolysin to MCP- 02 and E 495, especially the increase from MCP- 02 to E 495, mainly resulted from the decrease of hydrogen-bond stability in the dynamic structure, which was due to the increase in asparagine, serine, and threonine residues. Finally, a model for the cold adaptation of MCP- 02 and E 495 was proposed. This is the first report of the optimization of hydrogen-bonding dynamics as a strategy for cold adaptation and provides new insights into the structural basis underlying conformational flexibility...|$|R
40|$|Part I. Several azoalkane-triplet {{sensitizer}} bichromophoric {{systems are}} synthesized {{and the energy}} transfer properties are studied. Intramolecular energy transfer to azoalkanes {{is found to be}} much slower than literature cases with aromatic hydrocarbon acceptors. This is the first study of intramolecular energy transfer to a small chromophore. Energy transfer efficiencies are studied by measurement of phosphoresence intensities and lifetimes in low temperature glasses. Polymethylmethacrylate is used as a rigid matrix for some emission studies. Competitive intra <b>and</b> intermolecular <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> the corresponding Stern-Volmer plots are used to determine energy transfer rates in solution. Eventually a bichromophoric system (AP-DBO) is synthesized that has both the desired rapid intramolecular energy transfer and a quenchable azo triplet lifetime of (TURN) 7 ns. Attempts to observe the azo triplet by transient techniques are unsuccessful. The triplet energies of several azos are estimated by kinetic spectroscopy using a graded series of sensitizers and the singlet-triplet energy gap is found to be constant at about 20 kcal/mol. Part II. The photochemical isomerization of azo- 1 -bicyclo 2. 2. 1 heptane is studied on long and short wavelength irradiation. Long wavelength irradiation yields (PHI) (,c( [...] ->) t) = (PHI) (,t( [...] ->) c) = 0. 5. Isomerization quantum yields on 193 nm irradiation from an ArF laser are much lower than 0. 5 and some deazatization occurs. An energy level diagram is presented to account for the observed results. Attempts are made to determine the triplet energy of cis-axo- 1 -bicyclo 2. 2. 1 heptane utilizing kinetic spectroscopy. The large triplet sensitized (PHI) (,c( [...] ->) t) combined with the lability of the compound thwarted this investigation...|$|R
40|$|This project investigates {{changes in}} protein {{solvation}} during the folding reaction of Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) of Escherichia Coli, and correlates this dehydration process with shifts in local polarity. Changes in solvent accessibility were probed by fluorescence <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> Stern-Volmer analysis while polarity was monitored via emission maxima; site-specific insights were gained by probing single tryptophan OmpA mutants (W 7, W 15, W 57, W 102, W 129, and W 143). Fluorescence experiments {{were performed on}} OmpA denatured in 8. 0 M urea, folded in small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs), adsorbed on SUVs, and aggregated in 0. 5 M urea. Time resolved experiments were performed during the folding reaction. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (KSV) and fluorescence maxima (λmax) showed a correlation where high values of KSV corresponded to red-shifted λmax. K¬SV and λmax values decayed from unfolded values of 8. 6 - 10 M- 1 and 351 - 354 nm to folded values of 0. 6 - 2. 0 M- 1 and 325 - 338 nm. Double exponential fits to the KSV and λmax data showed fast (~ 3 – 11 minutes) and slow components (~ 26 – 49 minutes). The majority of λmax shift occurs in the fast step, {{while the majority of}} dehydration occurs in the slower step. The fast component was attributed to a transition of the trp residues of unfolded OmpA to a partially adsorbed state in the bilayer headgroup. A slower, dehydration event took place in which the protein fully inserted into the bilayer. These results complement previously proposed mechanisms of concerted folding, and provided insights into changes in solvation that accompanies formation of native structure...|$|R
40|$|The heat induced {{conformational}} {{and structural}} changes of glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger at pH 5. 0 and 4. 0 were investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy. Experimental studies {{were conducted in}} buffer solution in the 25 °C- 70 °C temperature range at constant time. At both pH values, the phase diagram was linear, indicating the presence of two molecular species induced by thermal treatment. When thermally treating the glucose oxidase at pH 4. 0, the denaturation process was faster than the one at pH 5. 0, {{probably due to the}} release of cofactor FAD and molten globule formation.

40|$|Solidification {{phenomenon}} which {{occur at}} the solid/liquid (s/I) interface {{play a major role}} in the determination of structure and hence the technologically important properties of a casting. However, metals being opaque, conclusions related to several important phenomenon such as boundary layer thickness, morphological evolution, and eutectic and cell spacing are deduced from <b>quenching</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>and</b> subsequent post solidification metallographic analysis. Consequently, limited information is obtained about the dynamics of the process. This paper will discuss the recent efforts at the Space Science Laboratory, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, to view and quantify in-situ and in real time the dynamics of the solidification process and to measure interfacial undercooling. First, a high resolution x-ray transmission microscope (XTM) has been developed to monitor fundamental interfacial phenomena during directional solidification of metals and alloys. The XTM operates in the range of 10 - 100 KeV and through projection is capable of achieving magnification of up to 16 OX. Secondly, an innovative collapsible furnace has been designed to quantify interfacial undercooling by measuring the temperature of a moving s/I interface in reference to a fixed s/l interface. This measurement technique is non-intrusive in nature and is based on the Seebeck principle. In this paper real time results obtained to characterize the dynamics of irregular eutectic spacing will be presented. As an example fiber to lamella or plate transition in the Al-Al 2 Au eutectic system will be discussed. Further, a resolution limit of 25 micron has permitted viewing in real time morphological instability and cellular growth in Al-Au and Al-Ag systems. Simultaneously, a systematic investigation has been carried out to measure interfacial undercooling for Pb- 1 wt. % Sn at and near the marginal stability regime. In conjunction with the XTM observations this study attempts to validate existing relationships between undercooling and growth velocity during plane front growth, marginal stability regime, and stable cellular growth...|$|R
