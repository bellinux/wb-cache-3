50|$|Bolection {{mouldings}} {{are also}} used to hold a panel in a door when the panel is not set into a continuous dado (groove) that surrounds the panel.

50|$|Small {{doors and}} {{shutters}} {{such as those}} found in barns and sheds are often constructed of shiplap cut directly from the walls, with only thin members framing or crossing the back for support. Shiplap is also used indoors for the rough or rustic look that it creates when used as paneling or a covering for a wall or ceiling. Shiplap {{is often used to}} describe any <b>rabbeted</b> siding material that overlaps in a similar fashion.|$|E

5000|$|The Bryand Brand House is a {{historic}} plantation house {{on the east side}} of Alabama State Route 14 near Marion, Perry County, Alabama. The two-story Greek Revival style house was built in 1845. Unique features of the interior are the treatment of the wide central hall as a quasi-dogtrot, the double-leaf front door, and the original <b>rabbeted</b> sheathing found on all of theceilings and on the walls of the central halls. The house was moved to its current site in 1978 to save it from destruction. [...] It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 22, 2010.|$|E
50|$|Hive {{bodies and}} hive supers are four-sided boxes with {{standardized}} inside dimensions. There are generally four different sizes. Outside box dimensions {{vary depending on}} the type of material used. Polystyrene boxes have much larger outside dimensions than boxes made out of wood. Deep and medium hive bodies are provided to serve as the brood chamber, the part of the hive where the queen lays eggs and the bees care for the larvae. Medium, shallow and comb honey supers are used for honey stores and to harvest the honey. The inside width is 14-11/16 inches (373 mm) and the inside length is 18-5/16 inches (465 mm). The frames rest on a <b>rabbeted</b> side along both ends of each box.|$|E
50|$|In socket-mounting, the {{aperture}} {{in the front}} face of the flange matches the inside dimensions of the waveguide. At the back, {{the aperture}} is <b>rabbeted</b> to form a socket which fits onto {{the end of the}} waveguide tubing. The two pieces are soldered or brazed together to ensure an uninterrupted conducting path between the inside surface of the waveguide tube and the mouth of the flange. This type of construction can be seen in figure 2, and is shown diagramatically in figure 3. A variation on this is butt-mounting, in which the waveguide tube abuts the back face of the flange. The back of the flange has a number of protrusions, sufficient to align the tube, but without forming an unbroken socket-wall around it.|$|E
50|$|A <b>rabbet</b> (also {{known as}} a rebate in Britain) is a recess or groove cut into {{the edge of a}} piece of {{machinable}} material, usually wood. When viewed in cross-section, a <b>rabbet</b> is two-sided and open to the edge or end of the surface into which it is cut.|$|R
50|$|The rebate plane (also {{known as}} the <b>rabbet</b> plane) is a hand plane {{designed}} for cutting <b>rabbets</b> in wood. It's a simple tool, used in many Western countries, with hundreds of years of history. It was in use in England at least {{as early as the}} 11th century.|$|R

50|$|The rebate plane {{commonly}} has a {{depth stop}} and a fence {{which allows the}} width and depth of the <b>rabbet</b> to be gauged.
