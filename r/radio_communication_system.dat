In his March 1893 St. Louis lecture, Tesla demonstrated a wireless system {{that was the first}} use of tuned circuits in radio, although he used it for wireless power transmission, not radio communication. A grounded spark-excited capacitor-tuned Tesla transformer attached to an elevated wire antenna transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a wire antenna attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter's frequency, which lighted a Geissler tube. This system, patented by Tesla on September 2, 1897, was the first use of the [...] "four-circuit" [...] concept later claimed by Guglielmo Marconi. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>system.</b> He never believed that radio waves could be used for practical communication, instead clinging to an erroneous theory that radio communication was due to currents in the Earth.|$|E

40|$|Background: Delays {{in getting}} medical help are {{important}} factors {{in the deaths of}} many pregnant women and unborn children in the low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Studies have suggested that the use of cell phones and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> might reduce such delays. Objectives: We review the literature regarding the impact of cell phones and <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> on delays in getting medical help by pregnant women in the LMIC. Design: Cochrane Library, PubMed, Maternity and Infant care (Ovid), Web of Science (ISI), and Google Scholar were searched for studies relating to the use of cell phones for maternal and child health services, supplemented with hand searches. We included studies in LMIC and in English involving the simple use of cell phones (or <b>radio</b> <b>communication)</b> to either make calls or send text messages. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. All the studies, while of various designs, demonstrated positive contributory effects of cell phones or <b>radio</b> <b>communication</b> <b>systems</b> in reducing delays experienced by pregnant women in getting medical help. Conclusions: While the results suggested that cell phones could contribute in reducing delays, more studies of a longer duration are needed to strengthen the finding...|$|R
