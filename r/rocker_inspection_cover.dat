40|$|As {{part of the}} Double-Shell Tank (DST) Integrity Program, remote visual {{inspections}} are {{utilized to}} perform qualitative in-service inspections of the DSTs {{in order to provide}} a general overview of the condition of the tanks. During routine visual inspections of tank 241 -AY - 1 02 (A Y - 1 02) in August 2012, anomalies were identified on the annulus floor which resulted in further evaluations. In October 2012, Washington River Protection Solutions, LLC determined that the primary tank of AY - 102 was leaking. Following identification of the tank AY- 102 probable leak cause, evaluations considered the adequacy of the existing annulus inspection frequency with respect to the circumstances of the tank AY- 1021 eak and the advancing age of the DST structures. The evaluations concluded that the interval between annulus inspections should be shortened for all DSTs, and each annulus <b>inspection</b> should <b>cover</b> > 95 percent of annulus floor area, and the portion of the primary tank (i. e., dome, sidewall, lower knuckle, and insulating refractory) that is visible from the annulus inspection risers. In March 2013, enhanced visual inspections were performed for the six oldest tanks: 241 -AY- 101, 241 -AZ- 101, 241 -AZ- 102, 241 -SY- 101, 241 -SY- 102, and 241 -SY- 103, and no evidence of leakage from the primary tank were observed. Prior to October 2012, the approach for conducting visual examinations of DSTs was to perform a video examination of each tank&#x 27;s interior and annulus regions approximately every five years (not to exceed seven years between inspections).

40|$|Aim: The Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention (KRINKO) updated the {{recommendations}} {{for the prevention of}} catheter-associated urinary tract infections in 2015. This article will describe the implementation of these recommendations in Frankfurt’s hospitals in autumn, 2015. Material and methods: In two non-ICU wards of each of Frankfurt’s, inspections were performed using a checklist based on the new KRINKO recommendations. In one large hospital, a total of were inspected. The <b>inspections</b> <b>covered</b> the structure and process quality (operating instructions, training, indication, the placement and maintenance of catheters) and the demonstration of the preparation for insertion of a catheter using an empty bed and an imaginary patient, or insertion in a model. Results: Operating instructions were available in all hospital wards; approximately half of the wards regularly performed training sessions. The indications were largely in line with {{the recommendations}} of the KRINKO. Alternatives to urinary tract catheters were available and were used more often than the urinary tract catheters themselves (15. 9 % vs. 13. 5 %). In accordance with the recommendations, catheters were placed without antibiotic prophylaxis or the instillation of antiseptic or antimicrobial substances or catheter flushing solutions. The demonstration of catheter placement was conscientiously performed. Need for improvement was seen in the daily documentation and the regular verification of continuing indication for a urinary catheter, as well as the omission of regular catheter change. Conclusion: Overall, the recommendations of the KRINKO on the prevention of catheter-associated urinary tract infections were adequately implemented. However, it cannot be ruled out that in situations with time pressure and staff shortage, the handling of urinary tract catheters may be of lower quality than that observed during the inspections, when catheter insertion was done by two nurses. Against this background, a sufficient number of qualified staff and regular ward rounds by the hygiene staff appear recommendable...|$|R
