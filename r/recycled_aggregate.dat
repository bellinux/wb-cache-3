Therefore, the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> satisfies the absorption specification. Also, add different portions of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> to the mixture will have different degrees of influences on the specific gravity, characteristic strength, compressive strength, modulus elasticity and flexural strength. They mix 0%, 35%, 50% and 65% of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> into the mixture and found that as the percentage of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> are added increases, the specific gravity, characteristic strength, compressive strength, modulus elasticity and flexural strength decreases. We couldn't indicate that the <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> is not good for using just by comparing these data with the natural aggregate properties. If we use 65% of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> or above, each physical properties will drop greatly. However, if we limit the portion of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregate</b> adds to concrete, it won't affect each property much. Based on the research and experiment test, [...] "the maximum replacement of recycled coarse aggregate {{that can be used in}} concrete is 35%".

30|$|The {{valorization}} of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{in concrete}} is not recent and {{many studies have}} shown that material made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> may have mechanical properties similar to those of a conventional concrete mixed with natural aggregates (Etxeberria et al. 2007; Evangelista and de Brito 2007; Li 2008; McNeil and Kang 2013). However, <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> are characterized by a high water absorption capacity related to the presence of old mortar attached to the surface of aggregates which hinders their wide use (Gomez-Soberon 2002; de Juan and Gutirrez 2009). The water absorption capacity affects both fresh and hardened states properties. At fresh state, the mix design of concrete with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> requires an additional quantity of water to obtain a similar workability as a concrete formulated with natural aggregates (Hansen and Boegh 1986). Such a modification may obviously affect the mechanical characteristics of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> concrete. Several studies have investigated the microstructure of <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> concrete and showed that the porosity is modified and increases with the replacement ratio (Gomez-Soberon 2002). It is also acknowledged that the high porosity of recycled concrete leads a reduction of the mechanical strengths (Gomez-Soberon 2002; Kou et al. 2011). Furthermore, several studies have shown however that mechanical properties of concrete made with <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> depend on other parameters such as the quality of concrete from which <b>recycled</b> <b>aggregates</b> are obtained (Xiao et al. 2005; Casuccio et al. 2008) as well as the replacement ratio (Belén et al. 2011).|$|R

Waste concrete amounts to a very large percent in the generated C&D waste in many countries. Waste concrete is a relatively good material and constitutes a valuable resource for various products. Instead of landfilling it, many European countries aim at recycling this material. In well developed recycling areas, the recycling rates are more than 90 %.
