50|$|Myxomatosis is a {{virus disease}} of rabbits {{which can be}} fatal. The {{symptoms}} are swelling of the eyelids and lips, conjunctivitis {{and the formation of}} skin tumours on the face, ears and limbs. The <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> acts as a vector for the disease and the virus has been shown to remain viable in the flea's mouthparts for at least one hundred days. The <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> has also been implicated in the transmission of the Bartonella alsatica bacterium, an opportunistic pathogen that causes disease in animals and man.|$|E
50|$|The flea's {{reproductive}} {{cycle is}} closely connected {{with that of}} the host species. The female breeds only in the nest of a breeding hedgehog, and this is probably prompted by host hormones, {{as in the case of}} the <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea,</b> Spilopsyllus cuniculi.|$|E
50|$|European hares {{have both}} {{external}} and internal parasites. One study found that 54% of animals in Slovakia were parasitised by nematodes and over 90% by coccidia. In Australia, European hares were reported as being infected by four species of nematode, six of coccidian, several liver flukes and two canine tapeworms. They were also found to host <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> (Spilopsyllus cuniculi), stickfast fleas (Echidnophaga myrmecobii), lice (Haemodipsus setoni and H. lyriocephalus), and mites (Leporacarus gibbus).|$|R
5|$|Adult female <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas,</b> Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make their way down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make {{their way back to}} the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|R
50|$|On <b>rabbits,</b> the <b>flea</b> is most {{commonly}} {{found on the}} head and body, whereas the related flea, Echidnophaga perilis, is more often found on the feet. E. myrmecobii is a minor vector of myxomatosis between rabbits in Australia.|$|R
50|$|Spilopsyllus cuniculi, the <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea,</b> is {{a species}} of flea in the family Pulicidae. It is an {{external}} parasite of rabbits and hares and is occasionally found on cats and dogs and also certain seabirds that nest in burrows.

50|$|The <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> {{is found}} worldwide, usually as an {{external}} parasite found on {{rabbits and hares}} but occasionally also on cats and dogs. It can work {{its way through the}} animal's fur but is usually found in clusters around the bases of the host's ears. On some of the islands off the coasts of the United Kingdom it can be found on Manx shearwaters and Atlantic puffins, presumably because the birds nest in burrows and often take over holes previously occupied by rabbits.|$|E
50|$|The <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> {{is about}} 1 mm long {{and a dark}} brown colour. It is {{laterally}} compressed, has three pairs of legs and no wings. Its head is held {{at an angle to}} its body and its mouthparts are adapted for piercing the skin of its host and sucking its blood. It has a pronotal comb or row of spines just behind the head and a genal comb of spines below the head and these help to distinguish it from other species of flea.|$|E
40|$|<b>Rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> {{for use in}} Myxomatosis {{investigations}} have been successfully bred on rabbits in an animal house. The timing of emergence appeared to be governed by a biological timing control interacting with different forms of disturbance.

The survival rate of fleas in storage was affected by temperature, the degree of crowding, moisture content of the containers, whether fleas were fed or unfed and the source of fleas in terms of emergence times...|$|R
50|$|Manx shearwaters {{frequently}} carry feather lice (Mallophaga) most {{of which}} either the feather-eatiers in the groups ischnocera, or Amblycera which also consume blood. The commonest are the Ischnocerans Halipeurus diversus and Trabeculus aviator. The nests of breeding birds frequently contain the shearwater flea Ornithopsylla laetitiae is also commonly present, which shares a common ancestry with North American <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas.</b> Where their burrows are near those of Atlantic puffins, the tick Ixodes uriae is common. The mite Neotrombicula autumnalis is often present, and has been implicated in spreading puffinosis. Puffinosis {{is a viral disease}} of in which young birds get blisters on their feet, conjunctivitis and problems with movement. The death rate can reach 70% in infected birds. Internal parasites include the tapeworm Tetrabothrius cylindricus.|$|R
40|$|The European {{wild rabbit}} has been {{considered}} Australia’s worst vertebrate pest and yet little effort appears to have gone into producing maps of rabbit distribution and density. Mapping the distribution and density of pests {{is an important step}} in effective management. A map is essential for estimating the extent of damage caused and for efficiently planning and monitoring the success of pest control operations. This paper describes the use of soil type and point data to prepare a map showing the distribution and density of rabbits in Australia. The potential for the method to be used for mapping other vertebrate pests is explored. The approach used to prepare the map is based on that used for rabbits in Queensland (Berman et al. 1998). An index of rabbit density was determined using the number of Spanish <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> released per square kilometre for each Soil Map Unit (Atlas of Australian Soils). Spanish <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> were released into active rabbit warrens at 1606 sites in the early 1990 s as an additional vector for myxoma virus and the locations of the releases were recorded using a Global Positioning System (GPS). Releases were predominantly in arid areas but some fleas were released in south east Queensland and the New England Tablelands of New South Wales. The map produced appears to reflect well the distribution and density of rabbits, at least in the areas where Spanish <b>fleas</b> were released. <b>Rabbit</b> pellet counts conducted in 2007 at 54 sites across an area of south east South Australia, south eastern Queensland, and parts of New South Wales (New England Tablelands and south west) in soil Map Units where Spanish fleas were released, provided a preliminary means to ground truth the map. There was a good relationship between mean pellet count score and the index of abundance for soil Map Units. Rabbit pellet counts may allow extension of the map into other parts of Australia where there were no Spanish <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> released and where there may be no other consistent information on rabbit location and density. The recent Equine Influenza outbreak provided a further test of the value of this mapping method. The distribution and density of domestic horses were mapped to provide {{estimates of the number of}} horses in various regions. These estimates were close to the actual numbers of horses subsequently determined from vaccination records and registrations. The soil Map Units are not simply soil types they contain information on landuse and vegetation and the soil classification is relatively localised. These properties make this mapping method useful, not only for rabbits, but also for other species that are not so dependent on soil type for survival...|$|R

50|$|Adult female <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of certain hormones in a female rabbit's blood {{that show that}} she is near to parturition. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they mate and start producing eggs. As soon as the young rabbits are born, the fleas move onto them and start feeding, mating and laying eggs. About twelve days later, they return to the mother rabbit. They complete this migration every time she produces a litter of young. The larvae are legless grubs, creamy-white with a brown head. After three larval stages they pupate. Fleas newly emerged from the pupa {{need to have a}} blood meal within a week, otherwise they will die. After that they can survive for many months without feeding. The optimum temperature for the flea's life cycle is 70 °F to 85 °F (21 °C to 30 °C).|$|R
50|$|Transmission of RHD occurs {{by direct}} contact with an {{infected}} animal and fomites. Rabbits acquire RHD through oral, nasal or conjunctival pathways. Urine, faeces and respiratory secretions may also shed the virus. The virus may also be carried by the wind. Carriers of the virus may remain infectious {{for up to a}} month depending on climate conditions; however, the virus has been known to persist for as little as 2 days and as long as 215 days. An infected carcass or hairs from an infected animal may also transmit RHD. Fomites such as clothing, contaminated food, cages, bedding, feeders and water will also harbour the virus. Even though the virus cannot reproduce in other mammals, predators and scavengers such as foxes, ferrets and some birds can excrete the virus through their faeces after ingesting an infected rabbit carcass. Flies, <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas,</b> and mosquitoes can also spread the virus between rabbits.|$|R
40|$|Laboratory {{studies showed}} that few <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> (Spilopsyllus cuniculi (Dale)) {{transmitted}} myxomatosis after removal from wild rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus (L) that had been infected for fever than 10 - 12 days, irrespective of the virulence of the myxoma virus strain involved. Rabbits infected with fully virulent (Grade I) strains died within 10 - 15 days and few fleas from these hosts became infective; averaging all the samples takem. 12 % of the fleas were infective. Also, few fleas acquired infectivity on individual rabbits which covered from infection with attenuated strains; the mean was 8 % infective. Rabbits which died between 17 and 44 days after infection had higher proportions of infective fleas at all sampling times; the mean was 42 % infective. Male and female fleas transmitted virus with equal efficiency. For rabbits infected {{with any of the}} attenuated virus strains the mean percentage of infective fleas was inversely related to the survival time of the host. Rabbits infected with moderately attenuated strains (Grades IIIA and IIIB) had, on average, the highest proportion of infective fleas; hence such strains have a selective advantage and have become predominant under natural conditions in Britain. The changes that might occur if there is an increase in host resistance to myxomatosis are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Chordopoxvirinae, genus Leporipoxvirus) 1 is {{a linear}} {{double-stranded}} DNA virus that specifically infects rabbits and hares. If introduced in European rabbits (Oryctolagus cunic-ulus), the virus causes the mostly fatal disease myxomatosis, {{named after the}} prominent mucinous skin lesions. 3 Affected rabbits display conjunctivitis, anorexia, listlessness, and fever. Animals may die within 2 days after onset of symptoms. In a more prolonged disease course, depression and myxomas in the eyelids, nose, lips, ears, vulva, or scrotum are observed. The edematous ears become heavy and droop. Animals usu-ally die within 1 – 2 weeks due to emaciation and dyspnea. 4 In {{the course of an}} outbreak, the virulence is reduced, 6 and the disease is characterized by reduced mortality in young animals and seropositivity of all adult rabbits. 2 The European rabbit is highly susceptible, a fact that has been exploited in the deliber-ate release of MYXV strain Moses in Australia (1950) and strain Lausanne in Europe (1952) to control feral rabbits. 5, 10 Both strains were originally isolated in Brazil. 4, 10 Contrary to the fatal disease in European rabbits, MYXV only produces local fibromas in its natural host, the wild American cottontail rabbits (Sylvilagus spp.). 3, 10 As seen in the Australian out-break in 1950, the virus is efficiently transmitted over large distances by blood-sucking vectors, such as mosquitoes and <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> (Spilopsyllus cuniculi). 5 In Switzerland, myxomatosis is a notifiable disease, and vaccination is strictly forbidden. 11 A total of 68 cases were reported to the Swiss Federal Veterinary Office from 1991 to 201...|$|R
40|$|The overall {{pattern and}} {{consequences}} of myxomatosis in wild rabbit populations were studied at three farmland sites in lowland southern England and upland central Wales between 1971 and 1978. When results from all years were combined, the disease showed a clear two-peaked annual cycle, with a main autumn peak between August and January, and a subsidiary spring peak during February to April. <b>Rabbit</b> <b>fleas,</b> the main vectors of myxomatosis in Britain, were present on full-grown rabbits in sufficient numbers for transmission to occur throughout the year, but the observed seasonal pattern of the disease appeared {{to be influenced by}} seasonal mass movements of these fleas. However other factors were also important including the timing and success of the main rabbit breeding season, the proportion of rabbits which had recovered from the disease and the timing and extent of autumn rabbit mortality from other causes. Significantly more males than females, and more adults and immatures than juveniles, were observed to be infected by myxomatosis. Only 25 - 27 % of the total populations were seen to be infected during outbreaks. Using two independent methods of calculation, it was estimated that between 47 and 69 % of infected rabbits died from the disease (much lower than the expected 90 - 95 % for fully susceptible rabbits with the partly attenuated virus strains that predominated). Thus it was estimated that 12 - 19 % of the total rabbit populations were known to have died directly or indirectly from myxomatosis. Although the effects of myxomatosis were much less than during the 1950 s and 1960 s, it continued to be an important mortality factor. It may still have a regulatory effect on rabbit numbers, with autumn/winter peaks of disease reducing the numbers of rabbits present {{at the start of the}} breeding season...|$|R
40|$|In South Australia, {{success in}} control of the European rabbit has been based on an {{understanding}} of rabbit biology and behavior. Drastic population reduction is obtained by use of Compound 1080. This method is much more effective when carried out during midsummer to late autumn. At this time, territorial boundaries are relaxed and the young have been weaned and are feeding aboveground. To ensure that the greatest number of rabbits can receive a lethal dose, it is necessary to pre-feed the population with un-poisoned bait over a period of 8 to 10 days. Oat grain has been chosen as the preferred bait material because of its acceptability and to minimize possible off-target effects. As warrens are an essential factor in rabbit survival, warren destruction is a vital part of any effective control program to prevent a resurgence of the population. Poisoning followed by ripping of warrens and then fumigation provided effective control in the most cost-efficient manner. Warrens can be destroyed with minimal disturbance to areas of valuable native vegetation. By promoting this system of integrated control and by explaining to landholders the biological reasons for its effectiveness, the major rabbit problems of South Australia 2 ̆ 7 s agricultural lands have been overcome. In addition to the improvements in farm productivity in both the short and long term, rabbit control often appears to be an essential tool in the management of native vegetation and native herbivores. In the low-rainfall parts of the state, the low productivity of the land makes it difficult to justify this system of integrated control in terms of cost-efficiency. Ripping of warrens by itself has been shown to provide reasonable control in hilly country with 250 to 300 mm of rainfall, when control takes place late in summer when rabbit numbers are low. However, biological control in the form of myxomatosis provides the most likely means of keeping rabbit numbers at a low level throughout the low-rainfall areas. European <b>rabbit</b> <b>fleas</b> from the arid parts of Spain are expected to be introduced soon to help spread myxomatosis more effectively in the arid parts of South Australia...|$|R
40|$|The European <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> Spilopsyllus cuniculi (Daley was {{introduced}} into Australia {{to act as}} a vector of myxoma virus. It was first released in the semi-arid Mallee region of Victoria in 1970 where epizootics cuased by field strains of myxoma virus occur each summer. Introductions of the readily identified Lausanne strain were made annually following the release of the flea. The introductions were successful and the strain persisted for up to 16 weeks despite competition from field strains. The Lausanne strain is more readily spread by fleas than the Glenfield strain which has been widely used in rabbit control. The ability of the Lausanne strain to persist and its effective transmission compared with the Glenfield strain may be {{due in part to the}} more florid symptoms of the disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of antibody of myxoma virus in wild rabbits following epizootics is {{highest in the}} semi-arid north-west of Victoria and lowest in temperate southern Victoria. Occurrence ranges up to about 90 % in the north-west and to about 70 % in the south except on the Western Plains where epizootics are rare and antibody occurrence seldom exceeds 30 %. The establishment of the European <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> may be changing the pattern of {{occurrence of}} antibody in the north-west by causing spring outbreaks of myxomatosis. It is suggested {{that the effects of}} the replacement of a simple recurring system of epizootic and breeding season several months apart by the occurrence of myxomatosis twice in the same year, once coincident with the breeding season, will be complex. The occurrence of detectable antibody may be less dependent on the infection rate and may be dependent to some extent on the relative timing of spring myxomatosis and the breeding season...|$|E
40|$|An {{identifiable}} {{strain of}} myxoma virus was introduced into four local populations of wild rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus {{on the southern}} tablelands of New South Wales (NSW) and its spread {{in the presence of}} other field strains was monitored for 6 months. The main vector in this region was considered to be the European <b>rabbit</b> <b>flea</b> Spilopsyllis cuniculi. Each population of rabbits was of a high density and living in groups of warrens covering areas from 59 to 87 hectares. Rabbits occupying centrally located warrens were inoculated with the virus in late September or early October (spring) and the subsequent appearance of myxomatosis across the sites monitored by trapping, shooting and visual observations. Samples, taken from rabbits with myxomatosis, were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that allowed identification of the introduced strain. On all four sites the introduced virus spread from the inoculated rabbits in the centrally located warrens to rabbits in surrounding warrens. On Sites 1 and 3, this spread continued across the entire site persisting for at least 118 and 174 days respectively. On Sites 2 and 4, the virus was detected for 78 and 62 days respectively and the subsequent inability to detect the introduced virus correlated with the appearance of an unrelated field strain. Using three different methods of calculation, rates of spread ranged from 3. 7 to 17. 8 m d(- 1) ...|$|E

The program is a cooperative effort incorporating state and federal vector-borne disease units and state and federal predator animal control personnel. The program has proven to be an important tool in the overall statewide plague surveillance program of the California Department of Health Services, and has been effective in detecting plague over broad geographical areas of the state, as well as in areas hereto-fore unknown to experience plague activity.

40|$|Vertebrate {{pest control}} in New Zealand is {{changing}} {{as a result}} of a reduction in state funding. Monetary assistance for control programs is being withdrawn at $ 0. 8 million per year and currently is $ 5. 4 million. This reduction affects several parts of the organization and the Agricultural Pests Destruction Council has initiated various programs to rationalize control. The major effect of reducing assistance is that the landowners have to contribute more money. The necessity of blanket control of rabbits is now questioned and two investigations are underway to determine the extent of the areas where rabbit control is required and demonstrate the effects of withdrawing any form of control from certain land classes. A national recording scheme is being implemented and computerization with a common format will enable pest districts to pinpoint problems and the APDC to summarize the national scene. Changes in technology have enabled the work force involved in control to reduce from 1200 (1972) to 400 (1986) with no apparent increase in reported pest problems. These changes include increased mechanization of bait manufacture, improvements in ground-laying techniques from 4 -wheel drive vehicles, motorcycles and use of fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. Increased reliance is placed on Rhodamine bait trials for deciding whether poisoning programs go ahead and trials of anticoagulants for rabbit control are continuing.
