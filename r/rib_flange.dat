40|$|The rib-skin {{construction}} using {{carbon fiber}} composites {{has been an}} attractive design option for aircraft control surfaces like aileron, elevator, rudder, flap etc. The major concern in such structures is the debonding between skin and <b>rib</b> <b>flange</b> which can occur due to low velocity impacts like tool drops, run way debris etc. Such debonds which occur in service are barely visible and may not get detected till the next inspection schedule. The integrity of the structure in the intervening period is of great concern to the designers. In the present work, the structural integrity of a composite flap structure having multiple debonds at the rib skin interfaces under fatigue loading has been addressed. The flap is subjected to cyclic loading at design limit load for 110000 cycles using a whiffle tree mechanism. The strains have been monitored at different locations to understand the behaviour of structure during the test using strain gauges and Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. Ultrasonic A-scan was used to monitor the defect growth after each block of 1000 cycles. The growth of debonds was not significant during the fatigue testing. The strain levels did not change appreciably throughout the test period indicating the damage tolerance capacity of the flap structure. The low growth of debonds was attributed to {{the low level of}} strains in the structure since the flap design is driven by stiffness considerations...|$|E

[...] This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the formation of basic differential equations for the determination of the stress distribution in reinforced monocoque flat-sided structures, such as rectangular or polygonal fuselages and wing boxes. The general scheme of the analysis is to develop the fundamental equations which govern the stresses, strains and displacements separately in the skin-stringer combination and <b>rib</b> <b>flanges.</b> Then, by identifying displacements along their intersections, the differential equations of compatibility are formed. The solution of these equations yields the stress distribution. It is intended that further papers will be devoted to the detailed solution and application of these equations to particular problems together with experimental verification for each type of problem. A simple application of the theory is demonstrated in an appendix. A three-bay flat structure, containing a rectangular cut-out in the centre bay, under uniformly distributed tension loading is investigated. The calculated results for the longitudinal direct stress resultants in the skin-stringer combination compare favourably with those of experiment...|$|R
40|$|A postbuckled, {{carbon fibre}} {{reinforced}} plastic (CFRP) wing box has been designed, manufactured and tested for an aerobatic light aircraft, the Cranfield Al. Methods of analysis have been evaluated including: i) Non-linear finite element analysis for the prediction o-f panel postbuckling. ii) A simpler technique based on an effective width method. This forms {{the core of a}} design program, 'oPTIMIST'. It predicts buckling loads, postbuckled reduced stiffness and overall column failure of co-cured hat stiffened panels. It then optimises the con-Figuration of a box beam for minimum weight. iii) The use of the effective width method allied to a large scale, linear finite element analysis. The work includes {{the development of a new}} method o-F construction for composite box structures. The wing skin sti-Ffeners and <b>rib</b> <b>flanges</b> are co-cured together. Integral slotted Joint features are formed in each part. The structure is then adhesively bonded together. A full description of the manufacture o-F the wing box is included. The structure was also tested in a specially designed rig. It was tested to ultimate design loads in: i) Positive bending to 13. 33. ii) Negative bending to - 96. iii) Pure torsion resulting from full aileron load. iv) Torsion with 96 bending. The compression panels were seen to postbuckle and recover in each load case. Results are compared with theory, and with the original aluminium Al wing. The structure is 257. lighter than its aluminium counterpart. Finally, suggestions are made for possible areas of further research...|$|R
50|$|Oeffag {{engineers}} {{noted the}} wing {{failures of the}} D.III and modified the lower wing to use thicker <b>ribs</b> and spar <b>flanges.</b> These changes, {{as well as other}} detail improvements, largely resolved the structural problems that had plagued German versions of the D.III. In service, the Oeffag aircraft proved to be popular, robust, and effective. Oeffag built approximately 526 D.III aircraft between May 1917 and the Armistice (586 in total according to other publications).|$|R
40|$|Shape memory alloys (SMAs) are a {{class of}} smart {{materials}} which are able to undergo large deformations while reverting back to their original undeformed shape upon heating or by relieving the stress that causes the deformation. When they are equipped in connections within a structural steel frame, this unique property could enhance the recentering capability of the structure after severe event. In this paper, a novel connection - integrating superelastic SMA tendons with steel tendons, is proposed between a H-shaped beam to a CHS column. Six full-scale prototype specimens with different combination of SMA and steel tendons were tested to evaluate the recentering capability and the energy dissipative performance. The novel connection consists of SMA tendons with original diameter of 12. mm, steel tendons with original diameter of 12. mm, extended end-plate, external diaphragm and beam <b>flange</b> <b>ribs.</b> Test results showed that connections equipped with SMA tendons exhibit moderate energy dissipation, double-flag-shaped hysteresis loops and excellent recentering capability after being subjected to cyclic loads up to 6 % interstory drift angle.

40|$|Abstract. Superelastic {{shape memory}} alloys (SMAs) can {{experience}} large strains up to 8 ~ 10 % and restore residual strains just {{by removing the}} stress. By employing this unique characteristic of SMAs, a new beam-to-column connection is presented in this paper. The proposed SMA connection consists of an extended end-plate, eight long shank Nitinol SMA bolts, beam <b>flange</b> <b>ribs,</b> beam web stiffeners and continuity steel plates for reinforcing column flanges. In order to predict the behavior of SMA connection, 3 -D solid finite element models are set up in ANSYS. The numerical {{results indicate that the}} local buckling of beam is avoided and a plastic hinge forms at beam-to-column interface when the moment-carrying capacity of bolt cluster is below the elastic flexural capacity of connecting beam. The SMA connection shows stable moment-rotation hysteresis curves with re-centering capability, which demonstrates the connectionâ€™s self-healing deformations function. Far different from energy dissipated by steel yield in traditional connection, the SMA connection shows moderate energy dissipation capacity, and this amount of energy is mainly dissipated by the superelastic behavior of SMA bolts. Moreover, the connection model shows a large inelastic rotation capacity beyond 0. 03 rad. The ductility of SMA connection is deeply influenced by the length of SMA bolts, and the 2. 2 times length of normal bolt is suggested for SMA bolts...|$|R
40|$|Machining of {{aerospace}} structural components involves many thin-wall <b>rib</b> and <b>flange</b> sections. These thin-wall sections are {{dictated by}} design consideration to meet required strength and weight constraints. These components are either forged or cast to the approximate final shape {{and the end}} milling process is used to finish the parts. Alternatively, the component is machined from a solid block of material by end milling with roughing and finishing cuts. During machining, the cutting forces cause deflection of the thin-wall section, leading to dimensional form errors that cause the finished part {{to be out of}} specification. In this thesis, a new methodology for the prediction of wall deflection during machining of thin-wall feature is presented. The new methodology aims to increase the efficiency on modelling the deflection prediction in machining thin-wall component. The prediction methodology is based on a combination of finite element method and statistical analysis. It consists of a feature based approach of parts creation, finite element analysis of material removal and statistical regression analysis of deflection associated with cutting parameters and component attributes. The model is developed {{to take into account the}} tool-work geometries on material removal process during machining process. Mathematical models are developed for the wall deflection correlated with cutting parameters and component attributes. The prediction values have been validated by machining tests on titanium alloys parts and show good agreement between simulation model and experimental data. In addition, the cutter compensation method derived from the deflection prediction values can be used to reduce the magnitude of surface error, thus improving the component accuracy for machining thin-wall feature. By adopting the cutter compensation method, only one machining pass is required to machine the thin-wall feature. This compares favourably to the current practice in step method which requires many machining passes. All research results have been derived for four different cases of typical aerospace component, but it is shown that these results can be applicable for other component shape and materials. To assist commercial applications, a customized computer program has been developed for the hybrid model. The computer program is an integrated data exchanges between modules upon users input on the design information and machining parameter for automatically generate the solid model, material removal model and FEM analysis. The new method is able to reduce the analysis time from weeks to hours...|$|R
