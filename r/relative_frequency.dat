5|$|The {{information}} sharing model assumes that individuals search concurrently for finding and joining opportunities while the producer-scrounger model {{assumes that the}} search modes are mutually exclusive. Hopping with the head facing up and downward are observed to be statistically associated with the frequencies of a bird's joining and finding, respectively. When the expected stable frequency of the scrounger tactic was altered by changing the availability of seeds, the <b>relative</b> <b>frequency</b> of hopping with the head up changed accordingly. When the seed distribution made the scrounger tactic unprofitable, the frequency of hopping with the head up diminished and appears to support the predictions of the producer-scrounger model.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} ways to {{classify}} climates into similar regimes. Originally, climes were defined in Ancient Greece to describe the weather depending upon a location's latitude. Modern climate classification methods can be broadly divided into genetic methods, which focus on the causes of climate, and empiric methods, which focus on the effects of climate. Examples of genetic classification include methods based on the <b>relative</b> <b>frequency</b> of different air mass types or locations within synoptic weather disturbances. Examples of empiric classifications include climate zones defined by plant hardiness, evapotranspiration, or more generally the Köppen climate classification which was originally designed to identify the climates associated with certain biomes. A common shortcoming of these classification schemes is that they produce distinct boundaries between the zones they define, rather than the gradual transition of climate properties more common in nature.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} empirical question regarding {{judgments about}} events is whether experienced absolute <b>frequencies</b> or <b>relative.</b> <b>frequencies</b> are relied {{on when the}} likelihood of a particular occurrence is judged. The present research explicates the conditions under which people rely on remembered raw absolute frequencies versus on inferred <b>relative</b> <b>frequencies</b> or proportions when making predictions. Participants saw opinion poll results for candidates prior to an election and, on the basis of these, made judgments concerning the likelihood of each candidate's winning this election. Certain candidates demonstrated a high absolute frequency of winning in the polls, whereas other candidates had high <b>relative</b> win <b>frequencies.</b> The results indicated that adults are cognitively flexible with regard to the inputs used in this judgment. Certain stimulus event configurations induced reasoning by way of absolute frequencies, whereas other configurations elicited judgments based on <b>relative</b> <b>frequencies.</b> More specifically, as the relational complexity of the event structure increased and more inferences were required to make predictions, the tendency to rely on absolute, as opposed to <b>relative,</b> <b>frequencies</b> also increased...|$|R

25|$|The Tripartite {{model of}} {{subjective}} well-being (SWB) {{is a theory}} developed by Diener which describes how people experience {{the quality of their}} lives and includes both emotional reactions and cognitive judgments. Psychologists have defined happiness as a combination of life satisfaction and the <b>relative</b> <b>frequency</b> of positive and negative affect. SWB therefore encompasses moods and emotions as well as evaluations of one's satisfaction with general and specific areas of one's life. Concepts encompassed by SWB include positive and negative affect, happiness, and life satisfaction. Positive psychology is particularly concerned with the study of SWB. SWB tends to be stable over time and is strongly related to personality traits. There is evidence that health and SWB may mutually influence each other, as good health tends to be associated with greater happiness, and {{a number of studies have}} found that positive emotions and optimism can have a beneficial influence on health.|$|E

Five of the subjects convulsed, and the others recovered when returned to normal pressure following the appearance of acute symptoms.

500|$|In Voltaire's Candide, Dr. Pangloss {{is portrayed}} as a clueless scholar who, despite the evidence, insists that [...] "all is for the best in this best of all {{possible}} worlds". Gould and Lewontin asserted that it is Panglossian for evolutionary biologists to view all traits as atomized things that had been naturally selected for, and criticised biologists for not granting theoretical space to other causes, such as phyletic and developmental constraints. The <b>relative</b> <b>frequency</b> of spandrels, so defined, versus adaptive features in nature, remains a controversial topic in evolutionary biology. An illustrative example of Gould's approach can be found in Elisabeth Lloyd's case study suggesting that the female orgasm is a by-product of shared developmental pathways. Gould also wrote on this topic in his essay [...] "Male Nipples and Clitoral Ripples" [...] prompted by Lloyd's earlier work.|$|E
500|$|A {{significant}} indirect {{influence was}} Thomas Simpson, who achieved {{a result that}} closely resembled de Moivre's. According to Simpsons' work's preface, his own work depended greatly on de Moivre's; the latter in fact described Simpson's work as an abridged version of his own. Finally, Thomas Bayes wrote an essay discussing theological implications of de Moivre's results: his solution to a problem, namely that of determining the probability of an event by its <b>relative</b> <b>frequency,</b> was taken as a proof {{for the existence of}} God by Bayes. Finally in 1812, Pierre-Simon Laplace published his Théorie analytique des probabilités in which he consolidated and laid down many fundamental results in probability and statistics such as the moment generating function, method of least squares, inductive probability, and hypothesis testing, thus completing the final phase in the development of classical probability. [...] Indeed, in light of all this, there is good reason Bernoulli's work is hailed as such a seminal event; not only did his various influences, direct and indirect, set the mathematical study of combinatorics spinning, but even theology was impacted.|$|E
