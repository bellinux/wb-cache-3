50|$|Two major efforts {{occurred}} in the 1950s. One of these efforts was by G. Moore and K. Berman at General Electric. The duo used 90% H2O2 (high test peroxide, known as HTP) and polyethylene in a rod and tube grain design. They drew several significant conclusions from their work. The fuel grain had uniform burning. Grain cracks did not affect combustion, like it does with solid rocket motors. No hard starts were observed (a hard start is a pressure spike seen close {{to the time of}} ignition, typical of liquid rocket engines). The fuel surface acted as a flame holder, which encouraged stable combustion. The oxidizer could be throttled with one valve, and a high oxidizer to fuel ratio helped simplify combustion. The negative observations were low burning rates and that the thermal instability of peroxide was problematic for safety reasons. Another effort that {{occurred in}} the 1950s was development of a <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid.</b> In a standard hybrid rocket motor, the solid material is the fuel. In a <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid</b> rocket motor, the oxidizer is solid. William Avery of the Applied Physics Laboratory used JP and ammonium nitrate, selected for their low cost.

50|$|A <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid</b> rocket, {{which is}} not very common, is one where the engine uses a solid {{oxidizer}} and a liquid fuel. Some liquid fuel options are kerosene, hydrazine, and LH2. Common fuels for a typical hybrid rocket engine include polymers such as plexiglass, polyethylene (PE), cross-linked rubber such as HTPB or liquefying fuels such as paraffin wax. Plexiglass was a common fuel, since the combustion could be visible through the transparent combustion chamber. HTPB is currently the most popular fuel for hybrid rocket engines, due to its energy and due to how safe it is to handle. Tests have been performed in which HTPB was soaked in liquid oxygen, and it still did not become explosive. These fuels are generally not as dense as solid rocket motors, so they are often doped with aluminum to increase the density and therefore the rocket performance.|$|E

Setting: Nordic Arthroplasty Register Association database (combined data from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland). Participants: 347 899 total hip replacements performed during 1995 - 2011. Main outcome measures: Probability of implant survival (Kaplan-Meier analysis) along with implant survival with revision {{for any reason}} as endpoint (Cox multiple regression) adjusted for age, sex, and diagnosis in age groups 55 - 64, 65 - 74, and 75 years or older.

The 10 year survival of cemented implants in patients aged 65 to 74 and 75 or older (93. 8 %, 95 % confidence interval 93. 6 % to 94. 0 % and 95. 9 %, 95. 8 % to 96. 1 %, respectively) was higher than that of uncemented (92. 9 %, 92. 3 % to 93. 4 % and 93. 0 %, 91. 8 % to 94. 0 %), hybrid (91. 6 %, 90. 9 % to 92. 2 % and 93. 9 %, 93. 1 % to 94. 5 %), and <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid</b> (90. 7 %, 87. 3 % to 93. 2 % and 93. 2 %, 90. 7 % to 95. 1 %) implants.

The efficiency of binding was followed by circular dichroism and further evaluated by the increase in melting temperature of the complexes. The efficient binding of netropsin and distamycins to the hybrid polymer (dIfl) n.

40|$|Nitrilases {{offer an}} {{economic}} and environmentally friendly solution {{for the production of}} valuable chemicals, and the degradation of toxic industrial nitrile wastes. A lack of fine structural data has impeded rational engineering of these enzymes to expand their utility. The nitrilases form large spiral shaped oligomers, seen by electron microscopy. These spiral structures are seen in all active nitrilases, and mutations altering this structure influence activity, stability, and substrate specificity. Currently no spiral forming nitrilase has been amenable to crystallization, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of these enzymes. Crystal structures from the larger nitrilase-superfamily reveal a conserved dimer structure and active site. Three regions in nitrilases are hypothesized to associate these dimer building blocks into the spiral oligomer. Two stand out as insertions relative to the crystallized homologs. These regions are hypothesized to associate the basic nitrilase dimer to form the large spiral structure. I investigate this hypothesis in the nitrilase CynD_(pum) by constructing mutations throughout these insertion regions and ascertaining their effect on enzyme activity as well as on oligomerization. A third region that stands out from the nitrilase sequences in comparison to the crystallized superfamily members is the extension of the C-terminus. Mutations to the C-terminus in various nitrilases can alter the proteins stability, activation, and substrate specificity, but how it interacts with other regions of the protein is not understood. In CynD, exchanging the C-terminus between the Bacillus pumilus enzyme and that of Pseudomonas stutzeri (CynD_(stut)) shows a one-way compatibility.

Conversely, the <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid,</b> where the P. stutzeri CynD is paired with the B. pumilus C-terminus (CynD_(stut-pum)) is not active.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Posterior-stabilized total knee {{prostheses}} {{were introduced}} to address instability secondary to loss of posterior cruciate ligament function, and they have either fixed or mobile bearings. Mobile bearings were developed to improve the function and longevity of total knee prostheses. In this study, the International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries used a distributed health data network to study a large cohort of posterior-stabilized prostheses {{to determine if the}} outcome of a posterior-stabilized total knee prosthesis differs depending on whether it has a fixed or mobile-bearing design. METHODS: Aggregated registry data were collected with a distributed health data network that was developed by the International Consortium of Orthopaedic Registries to reduce barriers to participation (e. g., security, proprietary, legal, and privacy issues) that have the potential to occur with the alternate centralized data warehouse approach. A distributed health data network is a decentralized model that allows secure storage and analysis of data from different registries. Each registry provided data on mobile and fixed-bearing posterior-stabilized prostheses implanted between 2001 and 2010. Only prostheses associated with primary total knee arthroplasties performed for the treatment of osteoarthritis were included. Prostheses with all types of fixation were included except for those with the rarely used <b>reverse</b> <b>hybrid</b> (cementless tibial and cemented femoral components) fixation. The use of patellar resurfacing was reported. The outcome of interest was time to first revision (for any reason). Multivariate meta-analysis was performed with linear mixed models with survival probability as the unit of analysis. RESULTS: This study includes 137, 616 posterior-stabilized knee prostheses; 62 % were in female patients, and 17. 6 % had a mobile bearing. The results of the fixed-effects model indicate that in the first year the mobile-bearing posterior-stabilized prostheses had a significantly higher hazard ratio (1. 86) than did the fixed-bearing posterior-stabilized prostheses (95 % confidence interval, 1. 28 to 2. 7; p = 0. 001). For all other time intervals, the mobile-bearing posterior-stabilized prostheses had higher hazard ratios; however, these differences were not significant.

These mixtures contain homologous series of compounds representing the polarity and the volatility range commonly sees in GC×GC.

Using this projection method, we identified four major types of orthogonality based on the peak dispersion obtained. We name those: Normal, <b>Reverse,</b> <b>Hybrid</b> and Transpose orthogonality. To characterize these observations, we developed the Orthogonality Index. Going back to the mathematical definition of orthogonality, this factor is the angle formed between the alkane line and the aromatic hydrocarbon line in the chromatographic space.

No significant structural distinction was observed {{between the two}} forms of amorphous silicon. A nanometer-sized crystallite was inserted into the as-implanted structure, to model medium-range order due to paracrystals, and the atomic network was energetically relaxed whilst maintaining consistency with experiment. Experimental pair-pair correlations were then simulated using a stochastic generalised Debye sum of fourth order. The idealised pair-pair correlation calculations {{were not able to}} readily distinguish between models with and without paracrystals. On the other hand, wave mechanical simulations surprisingly showed that paracrystals could be experimentally imaged using phase contrast transmission electron microscopy and/or nanoscale electron diffraction on a contemporary aberration-corrected microscope...|$|R
40|$|An ideal atomistic {{model of}} a disordered {{material}} should contradict no experiments,and should also be consistent with accurate force fields (either ab initioor empirical). We make significant progress toward jointly satisfying both of these criteria using a <b>hybrid</b> <b>reverse</b> Monte Carlo approach in conjunction with approximate first principles molecular dynamics. We illustrate the method by studying the complex binary glassy material g-GeSe_ 2. By constraining the model to agree with partial structure factors and ab initio simulation, we obtain a 647 -atom model {{in close agreement with}} experiment, including the first sharp diffraction peak in the static structure factor. We compute the electronic state densities and compare to photoelectron spectroscopies. The approach is general and flexible. Comment: 6 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|Study of genome {{incompatibilities}} {{in species}} hybrids {{is important for}} understanding the genetic basis of reproductive isolation and speciation. According to Haldane’s rulehybridization affects the heterogametic sex more than the homogametic sex. Several theories have been proposed that attribute asymmetry in hybridization effects to either phenotype (sex) or genotype (heterogamety). Here we investigate the genetic basis of hybrid genome incompatibility in the haplodiploid wasp Nasonia using the powerful features of haploid males and sex reversal. We separately investigate the effects of heterozygosity (ploidy level) and sex by generating sex <b>reversed</b> diploid <b>hybrid</b> males and comparing them to genotypically similar haploid hybrid males and diploid hybrid females. Hybrid effects of sterility were more pronounced than of inviability, and were particularly strong in haploid males, but weak to absent in diploid males and females, indicating a strong ploidy level but no sex specific effect. Molecular markers {{identified a number of}} genomic regions associated with hybrid inviability in haploid males that disappeared under diploidy in both hybrid males and females. Hybrid inviability was rescued by dominance effects at some genomic regions, but aggravated or alleviated by dosage effects at other regions, consistent with cytonuclear incompatibilities. Dosage effects underlying Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller (BDM) incompatibilities need more consideration in explaining Haldane’s Rule in diploid systems...|$|R
40|$|Porous solids {{are very}} {{important}} from a scientific point of view as they provide a medium in which to study the behavior of confined fluids. Although some porous solids have a well defined pore geometry such as zeolites, many porous solids lack crystalline order and are usually described as amorphous. The description of the pore geometry in such structures is very difficult. The authors develop a modeling approach using a Monte Carlo algorithm to simulate porosity within amorphous systems based on constraints for the internal volume and surface area. To illustrate this approach, a model of microporous amorphous silicon is presented. Structural aspects of the porous model are then compared against <b>hybrid</b> <b>reverse</b> Monte Carlo simulations of nonporous amorphous silicon and published results from the literature. It is found that coordination defects are predominately located at the pore surface walls...|$|R
