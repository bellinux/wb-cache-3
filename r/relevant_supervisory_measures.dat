The essential areas governed by the Payment Services Act are market access and licensing requirements for payment institutions (including the <b>relevant</b> <b>supervisory</b> provisions) as well as the issues of transparency, liability and recourse in the execution of payment services. The definition of payment institutions now allows nonbanks to provide payment services (subject to certain licensing and supervisory provisions), which – as classic banking transactions – were previously the exclusive domain of credit institutions in Austria.

40|$|It {{will be a}} truism {{to state}} that {{globalisation}} and recent rapid development of information and communications technologies have resulted in increased trans-border personal data transfers and – {{at the same time}} – in the elevation of corresponding risks. This phenomenon both has placed the governance of privacy and personal data protection at the international level and has made data privacy violations with cross-border implications much more frequent. As a result, there grew a critical need for stronger, more enhanced and more efficient cross-border cooperation between <b>relevant</b> <b>supervisory</b> authorities, i. e. between those public bodies that are tasked with “the day-to-day protection of data privacy”, on whose shoulders “lies the main burden of effective protection”. The status quo of such cooperation leaves much to be desired. Nowadays – to ensure an appropriate level of protection of privacy and personal data and to investigate and prosecute violations, should they occur – these supervisory authorities face constraints by way of human and/or budgetary shortages, practical, institutional and legislative set-ups and similar factors. Often, {{due to the lack of}} cooperation and coordination, these resource-constrained authorities may also investigate the same privacy issue, which is, in effect, a duplication of effort. For these reasons, policy-makers, authorities themselves and academics – since as early as 2000 s – became preoccupied with diagnosing the problem and with the quest for solutions.

In the new global system in which more risk will be taken and more precaution will be needed, the “new normal” contains and involves a <b>supervisory</b> <b>measure</b> which is rather regulative. Now the rules of “new normal”ization are being discussed instead of the old standards and systems. In the present era through which we are passing, enterprises have various responsibilities and duties in order to provide the necessary compliance for the state of affairs and in finding solutions for the conflicts. And these are mainly made up of finding answers to the questions with respect to competition, market, technology, and human beings; and at the same time it is necessary that the enterprise should find new ways for its capacity of change and for expanding in the market and for improving.

40|$|The {{reform of}} {{planning}} and managing system of the national economy in Poland is mostly concerned with a functioning of State enterprises. The new economic model has endowed its organizations with an economic independence, self-management and self-financing. The idea of self-management of enterprises is manifested {{in the shape of}} worker's self-management. Worker's councils are presently functioning as a basic and permanently active organ of the worker's self-management. According to sec. 2, par. 2 of the Act of 25 Sept. 1981, the worker's council is an organ and representation of the personnel's self-management. Simultaneously, by virtue of the State enterprises' Act, the workers' council obtained a status of the organ of State enterprise. Being the organ of workers' self-management, the worker's council enjoyes an attribute of independence from the State administration organs, {{as well as from the}} political and union ones. Consequently no pressure can be exerted by these organs on the worker's council in the scope of its preemption. There are direct ties between the council and the personnel of an enterprise in order to secure the independence of the first: the council is elected by the personnel in a direct, general and equal poll. The independent status of the council member is guaranteed by the interdiction of a notice or dissolution of an employment contract without a previous consent of the council. The attribute of council's independence does not imply its isolation from other organs of the enterprise management. It concerns both the workers' self-management organs and organs managing professionally i. e. the enterprise director. Relations of the council to the general assembly of the personnel are based on a definite dependence of the council from the assembly. The assembly passes, among others, a statute of the workers' self management, the basic, internal normative act stating the position and functioning rules of the workers' council. The assembly is also vested with a right to recall a council in toto or its individual members. Mutual interdependence and, to some extent, keeping each other under control are characteristic of the relations between the council and the director of an enterprise. The workers' council is vested with the right to suspend the execution of a director's decision and the director, in turn, can suspend the execution of a council's resolution. Contentions as to an application of the <b>supervisory</b> <b>measures</b> are tried under special mode of proceedings. The up-to-date practice does not allow for more exhaustive evaluation of the effectiveness of self-management organs in the State enterprises. One can venture the opinion that a rank of the self management organs will be increasing with the process of making enterprises independent.

The present study thereby searches to build upon the small but growing literature that focuses particularly on boards in a two-tier system. It extends the current knowledge about the effectiveness of <b>supervisory</b> boards by <b>measuring</b> the interaction of board work and firm performance and illustrates the differences and similarities between the one-tier and the two-tier system in this context. It moreover highlights the advantages of testing board effectiveness in a dualistic system and enriches our current understanding on how various board characteristics at once impact the financial performance of a firm.

40|$|The {{present study}} examined, {{for a range}} of {{industrial}} management positions, the relationship of supervisory style patterns at adjacent managerial levels to supervisory performance and job satisfaction. It also investigated the utility of Fiedler’s Contingency Model for determining the supervisory style associated with optimal work group performance at the middle levels of industrial management. Supervisory style was viewed as {{the extent to which a}} supervisor’s job related behaviour was basically task-oriented or human relations-oriented. One hundred and twenty-four production supervisory staff representing six manufacturing companies and six organizational levels completed a multi-faceted questionnaire. Measurement devices included: three indices of <b>supervisory</b> style, <b>measures</b> of satisfaction with four separate aspects of the job, two higher management ratings of job performance and independent ratings of position power and job task structure. The results suggested that, for most levels of industrial management, a subordinate manager’s similarity to his immediate supervisor was unrelated to the subordinate’s job satisfaction. At the third level of management similarity of supervisory style was positively related to this manager’s satisfaction with his work and his coworkers. The results provided considerable support for earlier findings which showed that subordinate job satisfaction was positively related to the supervisor’s “consideration” behaviour as perceived by the subordinate manager. Analysis of data related to the Contingency Model provided little support for the model’s validity in terms of the present sample...|$|R
40|$|The Florence School of Banking & Finance is a European {{platform}} {{bringing together}} practitioners and academics from the Banking and Finance sector {{to develop a}} common culture of regulation and supervision in the European Union. If bank services provide positive externalities to society, then not all taxpayer risk should be removed. • Regulation and supervision should aim at balancing {{the risks and benefits}} of banking, taking into account all externalities involved. The correct solution is not one in which all taxpayer risk is removed. • Society should be put in a position to express more explicitly its preference as to where that balance is located. • We need proxies for bank risk and stability, providing a yardstick for setting <b>supervisory</b> goals and <b>measuring</b> performance. • Evidence is needed on the interconnections and feedbacks between banks and the economy...|$|R
