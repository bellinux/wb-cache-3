60|$|The painter <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{through his}} hair, but stopped them half-way, as if {{aware that he}} was being guilty of ill-breeding.|$|E
60|$|Calm {{and dignified}} he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over them feeling their muscles, and then forced back their lips and {{examined}} their teeth and mouths.|$|E
60|$|He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> corkscrewed hair, his {{familiar}} gesture.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Cluyme <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> chop whiskers, {{and lowered}} his voice.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sumner was in deep perplexity. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> hair.|$|R
60|$|A {{tall man}} in a white sweater towered over Ken. It was the famous trainer. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over Ken's smooth skin and felt of the muscles.|$|E
6000|$|... "We're {{standing}} on it." [...] Hendricks <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> {{over the surface}} of the well stones. [...] "The eye-lock responds to me, not to anybody else. It's my ship. Or it was supposed to be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah! the old {{equatorial}} wind {{is blowing}} today, and my hair crackles with electricity." [...] He smiled as he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through his hair. [...] "On such days I long for my pony again. Sometimes, when I can't stand it any longer, I take a train to some little station {{and go out and}} lie flat down on the grass on my back, so that I can't see anything but sky; then I can almost imagine myself back again where the lone old peaks bulge against the sky. Do you know John Muir and Joaquin Miller?" ...|$|E
60|$|The chief arose and, {{walking to}} the ladder, <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along one of the rungs.|$|R
60|$|The elderly shipping-clerk {{leaned back}} in <b>his</b> chair and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> hair, thoughtfully.|$|R
6000|$|Anderson {{turned away}} {{a little and}} <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over the papers on his desk. Did she only imagine that <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> shook a little? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense, madam," [...] Collins interposed. [...] "The {{trick is}} {{absolutely}} safe. And it's a good one, a money-maker. Straighten up a moment." [...] With his hands he began feeling out {{her shoulders and}} back under her jacket. [...] "The apparatus is all right." [...] He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> down her arms. [...] "Now! Drop the hooks." [...] He shook each arm, and from under each of the fluffy lace cuffs fell out an iron hook fast to a thin cable of steel that evidently ran up her sleeves. [...] "Not that way! Nobody must see. Put them back. Try it again. They must come down hidden in your palms. Like this. See.--That's it. That's the idea." ...|$|E
60|$|But his {{precautions}} were needless. The bullet had severed {{the spinal}} column. The silver fox of Smugglers' Hollow had stalked his last rabbit {{and made his}} last kill. In the revulsion of feeling from the reaction following the long nervous strain Sparrer hardly knew whether to laugh or cry. As he stretched the black form out on the snow and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through the wonderful soft black fur and admired the great tail with its tip of snowy white he had for the moment almost a feeling of regret {{that he had been}} the means of destroying so beautiful a creature. Then the true significance of his achievement, luck he called it, swept over him and his eyes shone as he pictured his reception at the cabin.|$|E
6000|$|A single terrible idea now took {{possession}} of him. He had been [...] "sold," [...] "taken in," [...] "done for." [...] He saw it all. In {{a state of}} intoxication {{he had lost his}} way, had been dragged into some vile den, stripped of his clothes and valuables, and turned adrift upon the quiet town in this shameless masquerade. How should he keep his appointment? how inform the police of this outrage upon a stranger and an American citizen? how establish his identity? Had they spared his papers? He felt feverishly in his breast. Ah!--his watch? Yes, a watch--heavy, jewelled, enamelled--and, by all that was ridiculous, FIVE OTHERS! He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> into his capacious trunk hose. What was this? Brooches, chains, finger-rings,--one large episcopal one,--ear-rings, and a handful of battered gold and silver coins. His papers, his memorandums, his passport--all proofs of his identity--were gone! In their place was the unmistakable omnium gatherum of an accomplished knight of the road. Not only was his personality, but his character, gone forever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush!" [...] murmured the desperado, and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{down the}} mare's nose. But this made her skittish, and she stamped sharply {{half a dozen}} times.|$|R
60|$|Michael Mont in flannels {{stood on}} the {{verandah}} smoking a cigarette. He threw it away as Soames came up, and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> hair.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's too had; too bad!" [...] Phil Newell <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> bushy hair. [...] "I don't {{believe the}} navy-yard {{authorities}} will issue a duplicate order." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jean de Lattre de Tassigny {{was buried}} in a state funeral lasting five days, in what Life {{magazine}} described as the [...] "biggest military funeral France had seen {{since the death of}} Marshal Foch in 1929". The Marshal's body was conveyed through the streets of Paris in a series of funeral processions, with the coffin lying in state at four separate locations: his home, the chapel at Les Invalides, the Arc de Triomphe and before Notre Dame. Those marching in the funeral processions, following the gun carriage on which the tricolor-covered coffin was carried, included members of the French cabinet, judges, bishops, and Western military leaders. The pallbearers included other Allied generals of World War II, such as Bernard Montgomery and Dwight D. Eisenhower. The route included the Rue de Rivoli and the Champs-Élysées, and the processions went from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre Dame, and then from Notre Dame to Les Invalides. The stage of the journey from the Arc de Triomphe to Notre Dame took place in the evening, and cavalrymen from the Garde Républicaine flanked the coffin on horseback bearing flaming torches. Walking behind the soldiers marching in the funeral processions was the lone figure of the Marshal's widow, Simonne de Lattre de Tassigny, dressed in black and praying as she walked. Thousands of people lined the funeral route, forming crowds standing ten-deep. The pageantry included the tolling of bells, and flags being flown at half-mast. The final stage of the funeral was a journey of 250 miles to the Marshal's birthplace of Mouilleron-en-Pareds in western France. In attendance there was the Marshal's 97-year-old father, Roger de Lattre. Aged and blind, and the last of the de Lattres, he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over the ceremonial accoutrements on the coffin, which included the posthumously awarded marshal's baton and his son's kepi. Then the coffin was lowered into the ground and the Marshal was laid to rest beside his only son, Bernard, who had been killed fighting under his father's command in Indochina some eight months previously.|$|E
40|$|In 1988, Israeli {{security}} forces {{engaged in a}} wide variety of repressive tactics aimed at putting down the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Rather than viewing these methods solely as products of instructions handed down from on high, this article regards Israeli tactics as emerging from processes of innova-tion and elaboration by military personnel. Rules stipulating the legal use of lethal force placed important limits on Israeli military behavior. Within those limits, however, soldiers were free to invent new methods of repression. The article draws on 50 open-ended interviews with Israeli military veterans. In January 1988, 21 -year old Eyal Masad stood watching with a cluster of Israeli soldiers as one of their number clubbed a Palestinian lying on the floor of Nablus military headquar-ters. 1 The assault was not an attempt to extract information, but was rather an impromptu punishment session for earlier stone throwing against Israeli troops. After a few moments, the trooper took a break, permitting a medical corpsman to verify the victim was not gravely injured. The medic knelt down, <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> over the Palestinian's body and then, according to Masad, "stood up and kicked the Arab, saying 'he's fine, there's nothing to cry about. ' " The beating continued for several more minutes. The assault was illegal under military regulations, but Masad, a second lieutenant in th...|$|E
60|$|Within {{the room}} that {{sheltered}} him Crispin chuckled, as he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{along the edge of}} the door until he found the bolt, and softly shot it home.|$|R
6000|$|... "They are {{certainly}} more daring, but no worse morally than Crabtree." [...] Tom <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> curly hair in perplexity. [...] "Who is aboard of this boat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{had better}} not stay {{here in the}} cold. I'll come when I have heard that boy's {{imposition}} and looked over these exercises.' And he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> hair again.|$|R
60|$|One by one {{the women}} and the men crawled up the ledge which ran along one side of 'Bullia's Room.' Degraded Muhammadan, pig-eating Musahr and wild Sonthal, Janki <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over them all.|$|R
60|$|Ingleby did it, {{and nothing}} more was said until a blaze sprang up. Then the {{corporal}} <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along the horse's coat. There was a smear of blood on it when he glanced at it.|$|R
60|$|She {{left the}} gate, {{and crossed the}} road to where he held the horse. Shelton, to conceal embarrassment, looked at the horse's legs, and noticed that the grey was resting one of them. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> down.|$|R
6000|$|WELLWYN. [Spasmodically.] Ah! Now that's what I want. [He dabs furiously at the canvas. Then {{standing}} back, <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> through <b>his</b> {{hair and}} turns a painter's glance towards the skylight.] Dash! Light's gone! Off you get, child--don't tempt me! ...|$|R
50|$|The series {{garnered}} controversy {{on release}} {{because of a}} scene where Frankie <b>runs</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up Margie's skirt. Wallace says {{she had no idea}} Shorter was going to do this, which is why her reaction was so authentic. Many stations around Australia cut the scene.|$|R
60|$|Before him, in the darkness, stood a roadster. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{over the}} pedals and levers, {{breathing}} {{a sigh of}} relief as his touch revealed the familiar control of a standard make. Then he went to the double doors. They opened easily and silently.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, a young millionaire like Waltham can {{get hold}} of cash {{whenever}} he wants it," [...] answered Dick. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> through <b>his</b> hair thoughtfully. [...] "This looks bad to me. Perhaps I had better take a train back to New York without delay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is a conspiracy," [...] cried De Coude angrily. [...] "There are no {{cards in}} my coat," [...] {{and with that}} he <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> into <b>his</b> pocket. As he did so tense silence reigned in the little group. The count went dead white, and then very slowly he withdrew <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and in it were three cards.|$|R
6000|$|Mowgli <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> {{down the}} {{diagonal}} checkerings of the immense back. [...] "The Turtle is harder-backed, {{but not so}} gay," [...] he said judgmatically. [...] "The Frog, my name-bearer, is more gay, but not so hard. It is very beautiful to see--like the mottling {{in the mouth of}} a lily." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Ventnor <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over <b>his</b> whiskers, and, {{entering}} a room, was impressed at once by its air of domesticity. On a sofa a handsome {{woman and a}} pretty young girl were surrounded by sewing apparatus and some white material. The girl looked up, but the elder lady rose.|$|R
5000|$|One {{particular}} famous retort {{is attributed}} to Longworth. One day, while lounging in {{a chair at the}} Capitol, another member of the House <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> over Longworth's bald pate and commented, [...] "Nice and smooth. Feels just like my wife's bottom." [...] Longworth felt his own head and returned an answer: [...] "Yes, so it does." ...|$|R
60|$|The Time Traveller put {{the lamp}} {{down on the}} bench, and <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along the damaged rail. 'It's all right now,' he said. 'The story I told you was true. I'm sorry to have brought you {{out here in the}} cold.' He took up the lamp, and, in an {{absolute}} silence, we returned to the smoking-room.|$|R
60|$|In {{three long}} strides, and by steps that were softer than a cat's, Crispin {{crossed to the}} door which he had rather guessed than seen. He <b>ran</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> along until he caught the latch. Softly he tried it; it gave, and the door opened. Kenneth was by then beside him. He paused to look back.|$|R
