40|$|High {{temperature}} and pressure produced in an engine of {{compressed natural gas}} with direct injection system (CNGDI) may lead to high thermal stresses. With less proper heat transfer, the piston crown material fails to withstand high {{temperature and}} operate effectively. By insulating the surface namely; thermal barrier coating (TBC) such as ceramic based yttria partially stabilized zirconia (YPSZ), heat transfer to the piston might be reduced and lead to improvement of piston durability. Hence, in this research, YPSZ coating was utilised to differentiate between the uncoated and conventional tin-coated piston crowns {{in terms of the}} ability to reduce thermal stresses on the piston. Several samples of ACS A aluminium alloy piston crowns were coated with bonding element of NiCrAl and Zr 02 ~ 7. 5 Y 203 namely the YPSZ as the top coat by using plasma spraying technique.

40|$|There is no {{standard}} or {{generally accepted}} <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> for fretting fatigue experiments. Therefore, researchers adopt an existing concept, or {{build a new}} <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> that meets their specific requirements. However, too many different <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> may be disadvantageous because the results of two different <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are hard to compare. The increasing amount of diversity is mainly caused {{by the lack of}} a recent literature survey on fretting fatigue <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> In 1994, Hills and Nowell described a few <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> in Mechanics Of Fretting Fatigue. In this study, the authors made a classification of <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> based on the contact geometry, which is determined by the test specimens, not by the <b>test</b> <b>rig</b> itself. The authors of this article present a review of the available literature, and present a classification based on the properties of <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> Fretting fatigue <b>test</b> <b>rigs</b> are first divided in two categories based on the geometry of the test specimen: full scale and coupon scale <b>test</b> <b>rigs.</b> The latter are mostly used to perform research and are subdivided in categories based on increasing functionalities. This is the ability to apply a fatigue load, a constant normal force, and an alternating slip in the range of some micrometers.

40|$|The {{composite}} {{stiffness of}} parabolic leaf springs with variable stiffness {{is difficult to}} calculate using traditional integral equations. Numerical integration or FEA may be used but will require computer-aided software and long calculation times. An efficient method for calculating the composite stiffness of parabolic leaf springs with variable stiffness is developed and evaluated to reduce the complexity of calculation and shorten the calculation time. A simplified model for double-leaf springs with variable stiffness is built, and a composite stiffness calculation method for the model is derived using displacement superposition and material deformation continuity. The proposed method can be applied on triple-leaf and multileaf springs. The accuracy of the calculation method is verified by the <b>rig</b> <b>test</b> and FEA analysis. Finally, several parameters {{that should be considered}} during the design process of springs are discussed. The <b>rig</b> <b>test</b> and FEA analytical results indicate that the calculated results are acceptable.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a design basis adopted {{for the construction}} of a test facility for the <b>rig</b> <b>testing</b> of rolling bearings.
