40|$|A {{proposed}} {{system of}} portable illuminated signs, electronic monitoring equipment, and <b>radio-communication</b> <b>equipment</b> for preventing (or taking corrective action in response to) improper entry of aircraft, pedestrians, or ground vehicles onto active airport runways is described. The main overall {{functions of the}} proposed system would be to automatically monitor aircraft ground traffic on or approaching runways and to generate visible and/or audible warnings to affected pilots, ground-vehicle drivers, and control-tower personnel when runway incursions take place...|$|E
40|$|Magnesium {{has shown}} promise as a lighter-weight {{alternative}} to the aluminum alloys now {{used to make the}} main structural components of axially grooved heat pipes that contain ammonia as the working fluid. Magnesium heat-pipe structures can be fabricated by conventional processes that include extrusion, machining, welding, and bending. The thermal performances of magnesium heat pipes are the same as those of equal-sized aluminum heat pipes. However, by virtue of the lower mass density of magnesium, the magnesium heat pipes weigh 35 percent less. Conceived for use aboard spacecraft, magnesium heat pipes could also be attractive as heat-transfer devices in terrestrial applications in which minimization of weight is sought: examples include <b>radio-communication</b> <b>equipment</b> and laptop computers...|$|E
40|$|The Picosat and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Systems Engineering (PAUSE) {{project is}} {{developing}} balloon-borne instrumentation systems as aerobots for scientific exploration of remote planets and for diverse terrestrial purposes that can include scientific exploration, mapping, and military surveillance. The underlying concept of balloon-borne gondolas housing outer-space-qualified scientific instruments and associated data-processing and <b>radio-communication</b> <b>equipment</b> is not new. Instead, the novelty lies in numerous design details that, taken together, make a PAUSE aerobot smaller, less expensive, and less massive, relative to prior aerobots developed for similar purposes: Whereas the gondola (including the instrumentation system housed in it) {{of a typical}} prior aerobot has a mass of hundreds of kilograms, {{the mass of the}} gondola (with instrumentation system) of a PAUSE aerobot is a few kilograms...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the bachelorÂ´s thesis is {{to determine whether the}} basic bodies of IRS ZR are able to efficiently communicate via the Pegas radio-communication system. It focuses namely on EMS ZR. The introduction describes the activity of IRS and the possibilities of the used radio-communication system. The practical part evaluates the <b>radio-communication</b> technical <b>equipment</b> and the knowledge level of members EMS rescue groups in this field. By way of conclusion of my thesis, I propose measures for increased efficiency of radio-communication at the place of the medical action...|$|R
40|$|Type {{approval}} of ECDIS systems {{is one of}} the important prerequisites for intro-duction of real ECDIS navigation into practice. The approval process is performed according to different international standards. Most areas of functionality are well covered by appropriate tests and procedures. Beside that, some deficiencies of standardisation are leading to the need of flexible interpretation of the require-ments. The added 'meta ' chart data and data encryption are some of these open questions. In addition, legal matters like mutual recognition of approval certifica-tion and the further carriage of paper charts backing ECDIS are still not common-ly agreed between national administrations. Fundamentals of Type Approval Functional tests leading to an official {{approval of}} a new type of navigational equip-ment is a traditional mechanism of contribution to ships safety and protection of environment for many nations. Internationa l standards as the base of these tests are the fundamental prerequisite of global acceptance of this certification process {{in one of the most}} global ised industries- shipbuilding and ships operation. The Bundesamt fur Seeschiffahrt und Hydrographie (Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency) has, among other tasks, a long history as a type-approval organisation. The BSH is the so called 'Notified Body ' of the Federal Republic of Germany for navigation and <b>radio-communication</b> <b>equipment</b> according to th...|$|E
