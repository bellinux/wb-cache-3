40|$|To {{understand}} {{the needs and}} requirements {{in the development of}} <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pumps,</b> we have to consider the current use and limitations of blood pumps in cardiac surgery. There are 5 different fields of indications for blood pumps in cardiac surgery. First, there is the possibility to use <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pumps</b> in the cardiopulmonary bypass system. Second, miniaturized <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pumps</b> can be used to support beating heart surgery. Third, we expect a growing use of <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pumps</b> in short-term ventricular support. The same applies to the field of chronic cardiac failure and long-term myocardial support. Finally, miniaturized <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pumps</b> can be used to support the ventricle during myocardial infarction. <b>Rotary</b> blood <b>pumps</b> are expected, based on their features, to progress in all these indications. status: publishe...|$|R

2500|$|With {{the land}} {{surfaces}} still sinking, the Commissioners looked {{at ways to}} improve the discharge of the engines in 1919, but did not take any immediate action. Instead, they considered the replacement of the steam engines by oil engines, and in 1924 asked Blackstone and Company Limited to supply two [...] oil engines, each with a [...] Gwynne <b>rotary</b> <b>pump,</b> capable of pumping 150 tons per minute. The engines were to be erected alongside the existing engines, which could then still be used as a backup in an emergency. The new Brandon engine was installed by Autumn 1925, but the completion of the Lark engine was celebrated in a much grander style, with all taxpayers from the district being invited to the opening, which was followed by a lunch party.|$|E
2500|$|... 1926 saw further improvements, {{when the}} {{traditional}} use of spades and barrows {{to maintain the}} drains was superseded by a petrol/paraffin dragline excavator, obtained from Priestman Bros. Limited. The Brandon steam engine {{did not last long}} as a standby as it was de-commissioned in April 1927 and finally sold for scrap for £25 in 1933. The Lark engine fared better, and although little used, was maintained in working order until 1945. Further consideration was given to upgrading the engines in 1939, but the start of the Second World War delayed implementation. Approval was eventually obtained to install a Crossley [...] engine driving a [...] Gwynne <b>rotary</b> <b>pump,</b> capable of pumping 150 tons per minute in 1941, but it was January 1945 before work was completed. The Lark steam engine was sold for scrap in July, and the engine house converted into a workshop.|$|E

50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> {{are driven}} by a {{crankshaft}} that is rotated by handles on two flywheels attached {{to the ends of}} the shaft on each side of the <b>pump.</b> <b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> can be built with two and three cylinders, and are operated by a team of two men. Pistons attached to the crankshaft draw in air through the inlet valves and then pump it through the outlet valves to an air hose which delivers the air to the helmet of the diver. Cylinders, valves and outlet fittings for air are generally made from brass for corrosion resistance in the marine environment.|$|R
40|$|Mechanical {{support of}} a failing heart is {{typically}} performed with <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pumps</b> running at constant speed, which results in a limited control on cardiac workload and nonpulsatile hemodynamics.

60|$|He had {{not long}} since {{gone to the}} native town up the creek and {{returned}} with a gang of laborers. So far, the negroes had worked well, but just now {{he did not need}} them and they lay about in the shade, some wearing a short waist-cloth and some a sheet of cotton that hung from their shoulders. The tide had covered the wreck, but the big <b>rotary</b> <b>pump</b> was running and, since the men had loosened the top of the cargo, it lifted the slimy stuff.|$|E
60|$|These {{reflections}} were, however, fragmentary, for {{the boat}} required attention, and he fancied that {{a good deal of}} water was finding its way into her. The Sorata would not lie-to without somebody at the helm, and he could only leave the tiller lashed for a few minutes now and then while he labored at the little <b>rotary</b> <b>pump.</b> Once or twice when he did so, a foot of brine came frothing into the cockpit across the coaming, and he commenced to wonder how long the breeze would last, for he was becoming sensible that another twelve hours of it would probably be {{as much as he could}} stand.|$|E

50|$|Drawbacks: The {{nature of}} the pump {{requires}} very close clearances between the rotating pump and the outer edge, making it rotate at a slow, steady speed. If <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> are operated at high speeds, the fluids cause erosion, which eventually causes enlarged clearances that liquid can pass through, which reduces efficiency.|$|R

50|$|The maximum {{efficiency}} of a <b>rotary</b> compression <b>pump</b> is the ratio between the volume {{in contact with}} the vacuum and the smallest contracted volume {{in contact with the}} valve. If the ratio is 1:1000 and the pump is exhausting to atmospheric pressure, the highest achievable vacuum is 1/1000 of atmospheric pressure. This corresponds to 0.76 Torr or 101.3 Pa. This limitation makes <b>rotary</b> compression <b>pumps</b> very hard to construct if lower pressures than about 1 Torr is to be achieved. The simplicity of the process makes the <b>rotary</b> compression <b>pump</b> cheap and it is widely used as a low vacuum pump or a fore pump to a diffusion pump.|$|R
50|$|<b>Rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> {{can handle}} solids (e.g., {{cherries}} and olives), slurries, pastes, {{and a variety}} of liquids. If wetted, they offer self-priming performance. A gentle pumping action minimizes product degradation. They also offer continuous and intermittent reversible flows and can operate dry for brief periods of time. Flow is relatively independent of changes in process pressure, too, so output is relatively constant and continuous.|$|R
40|$|Today, <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> are {{routinely}} used for extracorporeal circulation in different clinical settings and applications. A review of these applications and specific limitations in extracorporeal perfusion was performed {{and served as}} a basis {{for the development of the}} DeltaStream. The DeltaStreams is a miniaturized <b>rotary</b> blood <b>pump</b> of a new and unique design with an integrated drive unit. Despite its small design, the pump maintains a sufficient hydraulic capacity, which makes the DeltaStream very flexible for intra- and perioperative applications. It also opens the field for short-term ventricular assist devices (VAD) applications or use as a component in extracorporeal life support systems (ECLS). The DeltaStream and, specifically, its impeller design have been optimized with respect to haemolysis and nonthrombogenicity. Also, the pump facilitates an effective pulse generation in VAD applications and simulates heart action in a more physiological way than other <b>rotary</b> <b>pumps</b> or roller pumps. Hydraulic and haematological properties have been tested in vitro and in vivo. In a series of seven animal experiments in two different setups, the pump demonstrated its biocompatibility and applicability. Basic aspects of the DeltaStream pump concept as well as important console features are presented. A summary of the final investigation of this pump is given with focus on hydraulic capabilities and results from animal studies. status: publishe...|$|R
