5|$|Tau Ceti {{has been}} a target of a radial {{velocity}} planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured over a five-year time span. This result excludes the presence of hot Jupiters, and probably excludes any planets with minimum mass {{greater than or equal}} to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's <b>resolving</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5|$|Before {{the modern}} medical era, the main means for {{studying}} the internal structures of the body were dissection {{of the dead and}} inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living. It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues. Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things. Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine. Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue. Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens. The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them. About the same time, in the 1950s, the use of X-ray diffraction {{for studying the}} crystal structures of proteins, nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy.|$|E

40|$|The {{reflectance}} {{spectra of}} minerals are studied {{as a function}} of spectral resolution in the range from 0. 2 to 3. 0 microns. Selected absorption bands were studied at <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> as high as 2240. At <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> of approximately 1000, many OH-bearing minerals show diagnostic sharp absorptions at the resolution limit. At low resolution, some minerals may not be distinguishable, but as the resolution is increased, most can be easily identified. As the resolution is increased, many minerals show fine structure, particularly in the OH-stretching overtone region near 1. 4 micron. The fine structure can enhance the ability to discriminate between minerals, and in some cases the fine structure can be used to determine elemental composition...|$|R

25|$|The {{telescope}} is operated {{in a global}} network with other large radio telescopes {{around the world in}} order to create an interferometric array. By careful correlation of this data researchers hope to create a telescope aperture with a <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> equivalent to the diameter of the Earth. The observatory hosts the Long Wavelength Laboratory of the University of Toronto, Dunlap Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics and the Communications and Operations section of York University's Space Engineering Laboratory.|$|E
25|$|In 1873, Ernst Abbe {{proposed}} {{that the ability to}} resolve detail in an object was limited approximately by the wavelength of the light used in imaging or a few hundred nanometers for visible light microscopes. Developments in ultraviolet (UV) microscopes, led by Köhler and Rohr, increased <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> by a factor of two. However this required expensive quartz optics, due to the absorption of UV by glass. It was believed that obtaining an image with sub-micrometer information was not possible due to this wavelength constraint.|$|E
25|$|An {{electron}} microscope is a microscope {{that uses a}} beam of accelerated electrons {{as a source of}} illumination. As the wavelength of an electron can be up to 100,000 times shorter than that of visible light photons, {{electron microscope}}s have a higher <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> than light microscopes and can reveal the structure of smaller objects. A scanning transmission electron microscope has achieved better than 50pm resolution in annular dark-field imaging mode and magnifications of up to about 10,000,000x whereas most light microscopes are limited by diffraction to about 200nm resolution and useful magnifications below 2000x.|$|E
40|$|The Space Telescope {{will provide}} {{views of the}} Universe of {{remarkable}} clarity. Central to its capabilities is an f/ 24 Ritchey-Chretien telescope with 40, 000 sq cm unobscured collecting area, which will provide point-source images less than 0. 1 sec in radius at wavelengths below 633 nm. It will operate over the range 110 nm to 1 mm. The initial flight instrumentation includes two spectrographs, the Faint Object Spectrograph (F. O. S.) and the High-Resolution Spectrograph (H. R. S.). The F. O. S. is sensitive from 115 to 800 nm. It will provide data at <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> 1000 - 100 on extremely faint sources. The H. R. S. operates at the wavelengths 107 - 320 nm.

40|$|Laser spectroscopic {{studies on}} minute samples of exotic {{radioactive}} nuclei require very efficient experimental techniques. In addition, high <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> {{are required to}} allow extraction of nu- clear structure information. Here we demonstrate that by using weak atomic transitions, resonance laser ionization spectroscopy is achieved with the required high efficiency (1 - 10 %) and precision (linewidths of tens of MHz). We illustrate experimentally and {{through the use of}} simulations how the narrow experimental linewidths are achieved and how distorted resonance ionization spec- troscopy lineshapes can be avoided. The role of the delay of the ionization laser pulse with respect to the excitation laser pulse is crucial: the use of a delayed ionization step permits the best <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> and lineshapes. A high efficiency is maintained if the intermediate level has a lifetime that is at least of the order of the excitation laser pulse width. A model that describes this process re- produces well the observed features and will help to optimize the conditions for future experiments. Comment: 11 pages, 11 figure...|$|R
25|$|Fluorescence {{microscopy}} is {{a powerful}} technique to show specifically labeled structures within a complex environment and to provide three-dimensional information of biological structures. However, this information is blurred by the fact that, upon illumination, all fluorescently labeled structures emit light, irrespective of whether they are in focus or not. So {{an image of a}} certain structure is always blurred by the contribution of light from structures that are out of focus. This phenomenon results in a loss of contrast especially when using objectives with a high <b>resolving</b> <b>power,</b> typically oil immersion objectives with a high numerical aperture.|$|E
25|$|In these systems, the {{separation}} between the stars is usually very small, and the orbital velocity very high. Unless {{the plane of the}} orbit happens to be perpendicular to the line of sight, the orbital velocities will have components in the line of sight and the observed radial velocity of the system will vary periodically. Since radial velocity can be measured with a spectrometer by observing the Doppler shift of the stars' spectral lines, the binaries detected in this manner are known as spectroscopic binaries. Most of these cannot be resolved as a visual binary, even with telescopes of the highest existing <b>resolving</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} analyser characteristics. The mass <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> {{is the measure}} of the ability to distinguish two peaks of slightly different m/z. The mass accuracy is the ratio of the m/z measurement error to the true m/z. Mass accuracy is usually measured in ppm or milli mass units. The mass range is the range of m/z amenable to analysis by a given analyzer. The linear dynamic range is the range over which ion signal is linear with analyte concentration. Speed refers to the time frame of the experiment and ultimately is used to determine the number of spectra per unit time that can be generated.|$|E

40|$|A new {{wide-angle}} {{imaging spectrometer}} configuration is proposed where an all-reflecting Schmidt camera is {{used with a}} prism spectrometer to give a field of view up to 60 deg or more. Four different designs using this approach are presented. These are the Imaging Spectrometer Free Flyer, the Shuttle Imaging Spectrometer A, the Shuttle Imaging Spectrometer B, and the Wide-Field System. These systems are capable of broadband spectral coverage from 0. 4 to 2. 5 microns, with footprints 20 m on a side or less, and with swath widths hundreds of kilometers; {{they are capable of}} spectral <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> of 200 or more...|$|R
25|$|An optical/infrared {{interferometer}} array doesn't collect as {{much light}} as a single telescope of equivalent size, but has the resolution of a single telescope {{the size of the}} array. For bright stars, this <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> could be used to image a star's surface during a transit event and see the shadow of the planet transiting. This could provide a direct measurement of the planet's angular radius and, via parallax, its actual radius. This is more accurate than radius estimates based on transit photometry, which are dependent on stellar radius estimates which depend on models of star characteristics. Imaging also provides more accurate determination of the inclination than photometry does.|$|E
25|$|The visual {{ability of}} {{birds of prey}} is legendary, and the keenness of their {{eyesight}} {{is due to a}} variety of factors. Raptors have large eyes for their size, 1.4 times greater than the average for birds of the same weight, and the eye is tube-shaped to produce a larger retinal image. The <b>resolving</b> <b>power</b> of an eye depends both on the optics, large eyes with large appertures suffers less from diffraction and can have larger retinal images due to a long focal length, and on the density of receptor spacing. The retina has a large number of receptors per square millimeter, which determines the degree of visual acuity. The more receptors an animal has, the higher its ability to distinguish individual objects at a distance, especially when, as in raptors, each receptor is typically attached to a single ganglion. Many raptors have foveas with far more rods and cones than the human fovea (65,000/mm2 in American kestrel, 38,000 in humans) and this provides these birds with spectacular long distance vision. It is proposed that the shape of the deep central fovea of raptors can create a telephoto optical system, increasing the size of the retinal image in the fovea and thereby increasing the spatial resolution. Behavioural studies show that some large eyed raptors (Wedge-tailed eagle, Old world vultures) and have ca 2 times higher spatial resolution than humans, but many medium and small sized raptors have comparable or lower spatial resolution.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent {{and ongoing}} {{advances}} in timing electronics {{together with the}} development of ionization techniques suited to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) have contributed to renewed interest in this method of mass analysis. Whereas low <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> (m/Δm < 500) were once an almost unavoidable drawback in TOF-MS, recent developments in instrument geometries have produced much higher <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> for many ion sources. The temporal width of detector pulses and jitter in timing electronics, however, lead to contributions to peak widths that are essentially independent of the mass-analyzer ion optics. The effective detector pulse width (Δtd ≈ 1 – 10 ns typically) can be a limiting factor in the development of high resolution time-of-flight (TOF) instruments with modest drift lengths (∼ 1 m). It also reduces the mass resolution more seriously for light ions. This article presents a method for distinguishing the instrumental “ion arrival-time” resolution (Ro) of a linear TOF mass analyzer from that which is locally measured at a particular mass, limited by the broadening of the detector pulse width and electronics. The method also provides an estimate of Δtd, that is useful in determining the temporal performance of the detection system. The model developed here is tested with data from a recently constructed orthogonal-acceleration TOF mass spectrometer equipped with a commercially available transient recorder (a LeCroy 400 -Msample/s digital oscilloscope) from which we obtained Ro = 4240 ± 100 [full width at half maximum (FWHM) ] and Δtd = 3. 0 ± 0. 1 ns (FWHM) ...|$|R

The structure assigned in 1991 to the antibiotic isolated from a marine organism, diazonamide A (C40H34Cl2N6O6, molar mass 765.65 g/mol), proved to be incorrect by the classical proof of structure: a synthetic sample was not identical to the natural product. [...] The mistake was attributed to the inability of X-ray crystallography to distinguish between the correct -OH / >NH and the interchanged -NH2 / -O- groups in the incorrect structure. With advances in instrumentation, however, it is now routinely possible to distinguish between such similar groups using modern single-crystal X-ray diffractometers.|$|E

40|$|An {{asymptotic}} {{analysis of}} balanced flow operations of differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) {{and a new}} class of instruments that includes opposed migration aerosol classifiers (OMACs) and inclined grid mobility analyzers (IGMAs) provides new insights into the similarities and differences between the devices. The characteristic scalings of different instruments found from minimal models are shown to relate the <b>resolving</b> <b>powers,</b> dynamic ranges, and efficiencies of most such devices. The <b>resolving</b> <b>powers</b> of all of the instruments in the nondiffusive regime of high voltage classifications, R_(nd), is determined by the ratio of the flow rate of the separation gas (sheath or crossflow) to that of the aerosol. At lowvoltage,when diffusion degrades the classification, the OMAC and the IGMA share an R_(nd) factor advantage in dynamic range of mobilities over the DMA, although the OMAC also suffers greater losses because diffusion immediately deposits particles onto its porous electrodes. On the basis of this analysis, a single master operating diagram is proposed for DMAs, OMACs, and IGMAs. Analysis of this operating diagram and its consequences for the design of differential electrical mobility classifiers suggests that OMACs and IGMAs also have advantages over DMAs in design flexibility and miniaturization. Most importantly, OMACs and IGMAs may outperform DMAs for the currently difficult classification of particles with diameters less than 10 nm. On the other hand, DMAs are more amenable to voltage scanning-mode operation to enable accelerated size distribution measurements, whereas it is most convenient to operate OMACs and IGMAs in voltage stepping-mode operation...|$|R
