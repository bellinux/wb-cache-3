5|$|A Passenger Information Display System (PIDS) was {{installed}} in all Metrorail stations in 2000. Displays are located on all track platforms and at the mezzanine entrances of stations, and provide <b>real-time</b> information on next train arrivals, delayed trains, emergency announcements, and related information. WMATA also provides current train and related information to customers with conventional web browsers, as well as users of smartphones and other mobile devices. In 2010 Metro began sharing its PIDS data with outside software developers, for use in creating additional <b>real-time</b> applications for mobile devices. Free apps are {{available to the public}} on major mobile device software platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Palm). WMATA also began providing <b>real-time</b> train information by phone in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Another {{difference}} is that machinima is created in real time, but other animation is pre-rendered. <b>Real-time</b> engines need to trade quality for speed and use simpler algorithms and models. In the 2001 animated film , every strand of hair on a character's head was independent; <b>real-time</b> needs would likely force them {{to be treated as}} a single unit. Kelland, Morris, and Lloyd argue that improvement in consumer-grade graphics technology will allow more realism; similarly, Paul Marino connects machinima to the increasing computing power predicted by Moore's law. For cut scenes in video games, issues other than visual fidelity arise. Pre-rendered scenes can require more digital storage space, weaken suspension of disbelief through contrast with <b>real-time</b> animation of normal gameplay, and limit interaction.|$|E
5|$|Dino Crisis {{utilizes}} {{an original}} 3D engine with <b>real-time</b> environments, {{as opposed to}} the pre-rendered backgrounds of the Resident Evil series. Mikami chose a <b>real-time</b> engine to enable better cinematic action and more dramatic character depictions that would otherwise be impossible. However, with the <b>real-time</b> engine came the challenge of hardware limitations, making it difficult for the team to create detailed environments. The team had to forego a jungle scene because of this issue. Mikami did however believe the team was able to create sufficiently detailed environments despite the hardware's polygon limitations. Like Resident Evil, the game takes place indoors in an enclosed environment. Mikami wanted to keep the claustrophobic feelings, thinking it was better to build fear.|$|E

25|$|A {{physical}} RFID tag may {{be incorporated}} with browser-based software {{to increase its}} efficacy. This software allows for different groups or specific hospital staff, nurses, and patients to see <b>real-time</b> data relevant to each piece of tracked equipment or personnel. <b>Real-time</b> data is stored and archived {{to make use of}} historical reporting functionality and to prove compliance with various industry regulations. This combination of RFID <b>real-time</b> locating system hardware and software provides a powerful data collection tool for facilities seeking to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, retired Canadian Senator Jean-Robert Gauthier, a hard-of-hearing person, filed a {{complaint}} with the Canadian Human Rights Commission against Radio-Canada concerning captioning, particularly the absence of <b>real-time</b> captioning on newscasts and other live programming. As part of the settlement process, Radio-Canada agreed to submit a report on the state of captioning, especially <b>real-time</b> captioning, on Radio-Canada and RDI. The report, which was the subject of some criticism, proposed an arrangement with Cité Collégiale, a college in Ottawa, to train more French-language <b>real-time</b> captioners.|$|E
