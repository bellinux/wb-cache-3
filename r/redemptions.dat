Nihilistic's management was committed to the entire team working in a one-room environment with no walls, doors, or offices, believing this would force the individual groups to communicate and allow each department to respond to queries immediately, saving hours or days of development time. <b>Redemptions</b> story was developed with input from Wolf; it was co-written by Daniel Greenberg, {{a writer for the}} source pen-and-paper RPG.|$|E
25|$|Continuing {{investor}} anxiety as {{a result}} of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy and other pending financial troubles caused significant <b>redemptions</b> from money funds in general, as investors redeemed their holdings and funds were forced to liquidate assets or impose limits on <b>redemptions.</b> Through Wednesday, September 17, 2008, prime institutional funds saw substantial <b>redemptions.</b> Retail funds saw net inflows of $4 billion, for a net capital outflow from all funds of $169 billion to $3.4 trillion (5%).|$|E
25|$|The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued final {{rules that}} are {{designed}} to address money funds’ susceptibility to heavy <b>redemptions</b> in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such <b>redemptions,</b> and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits.|$|E

Moreover, Jim?s death is justifiable as his true <b>redemption,</b> since Jim?s death is the <b>redemption</b> of his courage, honor, and guilt. From the analysis, the writer views that Jim?s search for <b>redemption</b> is meaningful because, at last, he can fmd his true <b>redemption</b> in which he gains his honor...|$|R

25|$|Lower costs: ETFs {{generally}} have lower costs than other investment products because most ETFs are not actively managed and because ETFs are {{insulated from the}} costs of having {{to buy and sell}} securities to accommodate shareholder purchases and <b>redemptions.</b> ETFs typically have lower marketing, distribution and accounting expenses, and most ETFs do not have 12b-1 fees.|$|E
25|$|ETFs have a {{reputation}} for lower costs than traditional mutual funds. This will be evident as a lower expense ratio. This is mainly from two factors, the fact that most ETFs are index funds and some advantages of the ETF structure. However, this needs to be compared in each case, since some index mutual funds also have a very low expense ratio, and some ETFs' expense ratios are relatively high. An index fund is much simpler to run, since it does not require some security selection, and can be largely done by computer. Not only does an ETF have lower shareholder-related expenses, but because it does not have to invest cash contributions or fund cash <b>redemptions,</b> an ETF does not have to maintain a cash reserve for <b>redemptions</b> and saves on brokerage expenses. Mutual funds can charge 1% to 3%, or more; index fund expense ratios are generally lower, while ETFs are almost always less than 1%. Over the long term, these cost differences can compound into a noticeable difference.|$|E

Now, as was hinted before, the <b>redemption</b> is already obtained, and that completely, by the person of Christ for us (Heb 9:24), as it is written, 'Having obtained eternal <b>redemption</b> for us'; yet these enemies, sin, death, the devil, hell, and the grave, are not so under the feet of his [saints] as he will put them, and as they shall be in conclusion under the feet of Christ (Heb 2:8,9). I say they are not; wherefore, as the text also concludeth, this <b>redemption</b> is with the Lord, and under our feet they shall be by the power of God towards us (2 Cor 13:4). And for this let Israel hope. The sum then is, God's people have with the Lord <b>redemption,</b> and <b>redemption</b> in reversion; <b>redemption,</b> and <b>redemption</b> to come; all which is in the hand of the Lord for us, and of all we shall be possessed in his time.

25|$|The SEC {{is giving}} money fund boards of {{directors}} the discretion whether to impose a liquidity fee if a fund’s weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and/or to suspend <b>redemptions</b> temporarily, i.e., to “gate” funds, under the same circumstances.

25|$|Asset {{liability}} mismatch/Maturity transformation – banks borrow more {{on demand}} debt and short term debt, but provide more long term loans. In other words, they borrow short and lend long. With a stronger credit quality {{than most other}} borrowers, banks can do this by aggregating issues (e.g. accepting deposits and issuing banknotes) and <b>redemptions</b> (e.g. withdrawals and redemption of banknotes), maintaining reserves of cash, investing in marketable securities that can be readily converted to cash if needed, and raising replacement funding as needed from various sources (e.g. wholesale cash markets and securities markets).|$|E
25|$|Hedge fund {{administrators are}} {{responsible}} for operations, accounting, and valuation services. This back office support allows fund managers to concentrate on trades.

Hedge funds in the United States {{are not required to}} appoint an administrator, and all of these functions can be performed by an investment manager. A number of conflict of interest situations may arise in this arrangement, particularly in the calculation of a fund's net asset value (NAV). Some funds voluntarily employ external auditors, thereby offering a greater degree of transparency.|$|E

25|$|Trafficking {{diverted}} {{an estimated}} one cent of each SNAP dollar ($330 million annually) from SNAP benefits between 2006 and 2008. Trafficking has declined over time from nearly 4 {{percent in the}} 1990s. About 8.2 percent of all stores trafficked from 2006 to 2008 compared to the 10.5 percent of SNAP authorized stores involved in trafficking in 2011. A variety of store characteristics and settings {{were related to the}} level of trafficking. Although large stores accounted for 87.3 percent of all SNAP <b>redemptions,</b> they only accounted for about 5.4 percent of trafficking <b>redemptions.</b> Trafficking was much less likely to occur among publicly owned than privately owned stores and was much less likely among stores in areas with less poverty rather than more. The total annual value of trafficked benefits increased at about the same rate as overall program growth. The current estimate of total SNAP dollars trafficked is higher than observed in the previous 2002–2005 time period. This increase is consistent, however, with the almost 37 percent growths in average annual SNAP benefits from the 2002–2005 study periods to the most recent one. The methodology used to generate these estimates has known limitations. However, given variable data and resources, it is the most practical approach available to FNS. Further improvements to SNAP trafficking estimates would require new resources to assess the prevalence of trafficking among a random sample of stores.|$|E

25|$|The crisis, which {{eventually}} became {{the catalyst for}} the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, almost developed into a run on money funds: the <b>redemptions</b> caused a drop in demand for commercial paper, preventing companies from rolling over their short-term debt, potentially causing an acute liquidity crisis: if companies cannot issue new debt to repay maturing debt, {{and do not have}} cash on hand to pay it back, they will default on their obligations, and may have to file for bankruptcy. Thus there was concern that the run could cause extensive bankruptcies, a debt deflation spiral, and serious damage to the real economy, as in the Great Depression.|$|E
25|$|ETFs {{are similar}} in many ways to {{traditional}} mutual funds, except that shares in an ETF can be bought and sold throughout the day like stocks on a stock exchange through a broker-dealer. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs do not sell or redeem their individual shares at net asset value (NAV). Instead, financial institutions purchase and redeem ETF shares directly from the ETF, but only in large blocks (such as 50,000 shares), called creation units. Purchases and <b>redemptions</b> of the creation units generally are in kind, with the institutional investor contributing or receiving a basket of securities of the same type and proportion held by the ETF, although some ETFs may require or permit a purchasing or redeeming shareholder to substitute cash for {{some or all of}} the securities in the basket of assets.|$|E
25|$|More than 20,000 captives {{were said}} to be imprisoned in Algiers alone. The rich were often able to secure release through ransom, but the poor were {{condemned}} to slavery.

While the chief victims were the inhabitants of the coasts of Sicily, Naples and Spain, all traders of nations which did not pay tribute for immunity or force the Barbary States to leave them alone were liable to be taken at sea.
