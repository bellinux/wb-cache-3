Experimental Work: In bilayer tablet formulation, the floating sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> was compressed and immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> was added over it, then both layers were compressed. Tablets were characterized using the official methods. Immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> contained Repaglinide, Sodium starch glycolate & Microcrystalline cellulose. In this study floating sustain <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> tablets were prepared using HPMC K 4 M alone, Na CMC alone & combination of HPMC K 4 M & Na CMC. Sodium bicarbonate & Citric acid were used as an effervescent agent. All formulations were prepared by using factorial design (32 & 23). All the above formulations were evaluated for in vitro drug release, buoyancy lag time (BLT), swelling ability, floating behavior. Results and Discussion: All formulations showed anomalous transport mechanism. This means diffusion as well as swelling controlled had played an essential role in drug release. Finally bilayer floating sustained release tablets was formulated by using optimized immediate <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> and optimized floating sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer</b> & evaluated as earlier.

The tablets contained an immediate <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> with the loading dose of the drug and a sustaining layer with maintenance dose of drug prepared by wet granulation method. The immediate <b>releasing</b> <b>layer</b> is directly compressed on to the sustaining layer. Sodium starch glycholate was used as super disintegrant and Eudragit RSPO and Eudragit RLPO were used as polymers. The drug polymer interaction was investigated by FTIR and DSC and their results directed further course of formulation. Valsartan tablets were evaluated for various post compression parameters like Tablet hardness, Friability, Weight variation, Drug content and In vitro dissolution.

The effect of concentration of hydrophilic matrix (HPMC K 4 M), binder (polyvinylpyrollidone [PVP K 30]) and buffer (sodium bicarbonate) on IB release was studied.

The inclusion of buffer (sodium bicarbonate) enhanced the release of IB from sustained <b>release</b> <b>layer.</b> The rational for formulation of bi-layer tablet of these two drugs in combination was (1) MTH increases the absorption of acidic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) by increasing gastric motility. So sequential release of MTH (as immediate release) and IB (as sustained release) was suitable for treatment of migraine. (2) MTH was degraded when prolonged contact with acidic NSAID.

30|$|To {{transfer}} the GaN devices, {{one of the}} key components involves <b>releasing</b> the GaN <b>layers</b> from its original substrate. The most cost effective approach to <b>release</b> GaN <b>layers</b> from its original substrate is to selectively etch a sacrificial layer. For example, Si released from Silicon on Insulator (SOI) and GaAs with AlAs as a sacrificial layers [12, 13]. The epitaxial lift off (ELO) method was well established since 1990 s’ due to the availability of the etching selectivity between GaAs and AlAs. Many devices such as LEDs, lasers, MESFETs, and Photodiode were demonstrated based on the ELO method, [12 – 14] and heterogeneous integration was achieved in these system [15]. However, in the case of GaN material, the use of sacrificial layer etching is still far less optimized in view of the material quality achieved and the device performance [16 – 18]. Laser lift off (LLO) [19 – 23], Photoelectrochemical (PEC) lateral etching [24, 25], were alternative approaches to <b>release</b> GaN <b>layers,</b> however, these methods were costly and limits the scope of application.

40|$|In {{the present}} work a {{so-called}} diffusion and reaction related model (DR model) is derived {{based on the}} notion that the overall etch rate in the epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process is determined both by the diffusion rate of hydrofluoric acid to the etch front and its subsequent reaction rate in the process.

The data suggest that the same GABABR may be present on both GABA and glutamate terminals in the EC, but that the heteroreceptor may show a greater level of expression in layer II. Studies with GABABR antagonists suggested that neither the auto- nor the heteroreceptor was consistently tonically activated by ambient GABA in the presence of TTX. Studies in EC slices from rats made chronically epileptic using a pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy revealed a reduced effectiveness of both auto- and heteroreceptor function in both layers. This could suggest that enhanced glutamate and GABA release in the EC may be associated with the development of the epileptic condition. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG...|$|R
