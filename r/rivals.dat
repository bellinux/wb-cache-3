40|$|Among {{heterosexual}} {{women in}} particular. a <b>rival's</b> physical attractiveness evokes jealousy, whereas among heterosexual men in particular. a <b>rival's</b> dominance evokes feelings of jealousy. The present study conducted with {{gay men and}} lesbian women examined whether these sex-differentiated responses reflect an evolved sex-specific rival-oriented mechanism according to which males and females pay attention to different <b>rival</b> characteristics or an evolved general partner-oriented mechanism, according to which males and females pay attention to those characteristics that their actual and potential partners find important. In an experiment, using a 2 (Participant Sex) X 2 (<b>Rival</b> Physical Attractiveness) X 2 (<b>Rival</b> Dominance) mixed factor design, homosexual participants were presented with a scenario in which their partners were flirting with an individual of the same sex. Lesbian women, but not gay men, reported more jealousy when they were exposed to a physically attractive <b>rival</b> as compared with a physically unattractive <b>rival.</b> Gay males, but not lesbian women, reported more jealousy when they were exposed to a <b>rival</b> high in dominance as compared with a <b>rival</b> low in dominance, especially when exposed to a physically unattractive <b>rival.</b> In addition, among women high in dominance. a dominant <b>rival</b> evoked relatively less jealousy, and among women high in social comparison orientation, an unattractive <b>rival</b> evoked relatively more jealousy. It is concluded that males and females posses an evolved sex-specific rival-oriented mechanism through which they respond more or less automatically to those <b>rival</b> characteristics that have been important in sexual selection in our evolutionary past...|$|R

40|$|Four studies {{examined}} {{sex differences}} in the jealousy-evoking nature of <b>rival</b> characteristics. Study 1, among 130 undergraduates, made an inventory of all relevant <b>rival</b> characteristics that were spontaneously mentioned when asked about a <b>rival</b> to whom one's partner might feel attracted. On {{the basis of these}} findings, in Study 2, among 240 undergraduates, a questionnaire was constructed, containing 56 <b>rival</b> characteristics. A factor analysis distinguished five dimensions of <b>rival</b> characteristics, i. e. Social Dominance, Physical Attractiveness, Seductive Behaviors, Physical Dominance, and Social Status. In line with the predictions, men reported more jealousy when a <b>rival</b> was high in Social Dominance, Physical Dominance, and Social Status, whereas women reported more jealousy when a <b>rival</b> was high in Physical Attractiveness. Study 3 largely replicated these findings in a community sample of 144 heterosexuals. Study 4 showed that gay men (n = 80) reported more jealousy than lesbian women (n = 73) when the <b>rival</b> was high in Physical Dominance, and more jealousy than heterosexual men when the <b>rival</b> was high in Social Dominance. Lesbian women reported more jealousy than heterosexual women when the <b>rival</b> was high in Physical Attractiveness. In Studies 2 - 4, favorable <b>rival</b> characteristics evoked more jealousy among those high in Social Comparison Orientation, particularly among women.
