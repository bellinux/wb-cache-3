Variations in record {{spacings}} (seperation from magnetic media to write head pole tips) are accurately achieved {{by using an}} identical set of disks {{for each type of}} media, with different overcoat thicknesses. Track edge noise is characterized using track profiles of the media noise. An integrated spectral technique is used to measure media noise, and the effects of the different playback spacings (seperation from magnetic media to read head pole tips or read element) are removed by dividing the spectral playback loss factor from the media noise spectra. On track transition noise is studied as a function of linear density at three different record spacings for each media type. Transition noise is found to increase with linear <b>record</b> <b>density</b> as expected, as well as with record spacing for a given linear density. Track profiles were performed at three linear record densities for each record spacing to observe the density dependence of similar effects on track edge noise.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we present}} a new {{irradiance}} caching scheme using Monte Carlo ray tracing for efficiently rendering participating media. The irradiance cache algorithm is extended to participating media. Our method allows to adjust the density of cached records depending on illumination changes. Direct and indirect contributions {{can be stored in}} the records but also multiple scattering. An adaptive shape of the influence zone of records, depending on geometrical features and irradiance variations, is introduced. To avoid a high density of cached records in low interest areas, a new method controls the density of the cache when adding new records. This <b>record</b> <b>density</b> control depends on the interpolation quality and on the photometric characteristics of the medium. Reducing the number of records accelerates both the computation pass and the rendering pass by decreasing the number of queries to the cache data structure (Kd-tree).

We {{discuss the}} novel problem of {{supporting}} analytical business intelligence queries over web-based textual content, e. g., BI-style reports based on 100. 000 ’s of documents from an ad-hoc web search result.

They execute information extraction methods over one or several document collections at query time and integrate extracted records into a common view or tabular structure. Frequent extraction and object resolution failures cause incomplete records which could not be joined into a record answering the query. Our focus is the identification of join-reordering heuristics maximizing the size of complete records answering a structured query. With respect to given costs for document extraction we propose two novel joinoperations: The multi-way CJ-operator joins records from multiple relationships extracted from a single document. The two-way join-operator DJ ensures data density by removing incomplete records from results.

Although the original method uses records having circular footprints depending only on geometrical features, our record footprints have a more complex shape which accounts for both geometry and irradiance variations. Irradiance values are computed using a classical Monte Carlo ray tracing method that simplifies the determination of nearby objects and the pre-computation of the shape of the influence zone of the current record. By gathering irradiance due to all the incident rays, illumination changes are evaluated to adjust the footprint’s records.

The final version {{is available from the}} publisher via the DOI in this <b>record.</b> <b>Density</b> functional theory (DFT) study of polypyrrole-TiO 2 composites has been carried out to explore their optical, electronic and charge transfer properties for the development of an efficient photocatalyst. Titanium dioxide (Ti 16 O 32) was interacted with a range of pyrrole (Py) oligomers to predict the optimum composition of nPy-TiO 2 composite with suitable band structure for efficient photocatalytic properties. The study has revealed that Py-Ti 16 O 32 composites have narrow band gap and better visible light absorption capability compared to individual constituents. The simulated results of band structure (band gap, and band edge positions), molecular orbitals, and UV–vis spectra of the optimized nPy-Ti 16 O 32 systems strongly supportthe existence of strong interactions between Py and TiO 2 in the composite. A red-shifting in max, narrowing band gap, and strong intermolecular interaction energy (- 41 to − 72 kcal/mol) of nPyTi 16 O 32 composites confirm the existence of strong covalenttype interactions. Electron−hole transferring phenomena are simulated with natural bonding orbital analysis where Py oligomers found as donor and Ti 16 O 32 as an acceptor in nPy-Ti 16 O 32 composites. H.

Most of the feral plants—one individual in Hornstein (Fig.  1 f; Burgenland); two individuals in Purbach am Neusiedlersee (Fig.  1 g, h; Burgenland); around 30 individuals at the “Zitzmannsdorfer Wiese” (Fig.  1 i–k; Burgenland); six individuals in Nestelbach (Fig.  1 l, m; Styria); three individuals at the unloading area of the port of Enns (Fig.  1 n, o, Upper Austria) and three individuals on a sand pile {{at the port of}} Enns (Fig.  1 p)—were fertile and had already produced cobs.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} research {{towards the}} realization of large-scale, ultra-dense nanowire-based circuits. The primary means {{for the construction of}} such circuits is the superlattice nanowire pattern transfer (SNAP) technique. This technique was optimized for the fabrication of large nanowire arrays containing over 1000 nanowires at narrow pitch and aligned over millimeter length scales. Silicon nanowire arrays were fabricated with wire widths down to ten nanometers, and with precisely-controlled electronic properties and bulk-like resistivity values through the use of diffusion doping and the selection of high-quality silicon-on-insulator substrates. A binary tree demultiplexer circuit allows the unique addressing of N nanowires from within an ultra-dense array using of order 2 xlog 2 (N) control wires. An implementation of this circuit was experimentally demonstrated to bridge from the submicrometer dimensions of lithographic patterning to the nanometer-scale dimensions of SNAP patterning. This circuit utilized field-effect gating by relatively large control wires to address individual nanowires from within a 150 -nanowire array patterned at a wire width and pitch of 13 and 34 nanometers, respectively. Silicon- and metal-nanowire arrays were integrated with [2]rotaxane molecular materials for the fabrication of an ultra-dense, 160, 000 -bit crosspoint molecular electronic memory circuit. This circuit is patterned at a <b>record</b> <b>density</b> of 1 x 10 ^ 11 bits per square centimeter (device-pitch of 33 nanometers), and contains bistable, electrochemically addressable [2]rotaxane switching molecules as the data storage elements within the individual crosspoint junctions. Defective junctions could be readily identified through electronic testing and isolated through software coding. The working bits could then be configured to form a functional memory circuit. The molecular-mechanical nature of the switching mechanism was confirmed through volatility measurements. An optimized two-step chlorination/methylation protocol was used to methyl passivate thin (20 -nanometer) silicon(111) -on-insulator microelectronic device surfaces, that were then demonstrated to be stable in air for arbitrarily long periods, and to resist oxidation due to common microelectronic fabrication procedures and wet-chemical treatments. Additionally, temperature-dependent mobility data showed that methylated silicon-on-insulator surfaces can be prepared with bulk-like mobility characteristics through careful optimization of the methylation reaction protocol. ...|$|E
