5|$|Arp 220 {{hosts the}} first megamaser discovered, is the nearest ultraluminous {{infrared}} galaxy, {{and has been}} studied in great detail at many wavelengths. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> is the prototype of hydroxyl megamaser host galaxies, and is often used {{as a guide for}} interpreting other hydroxyl megamasers and their hosts.|$|E

Other antibiotics may be recommended instead due to this <b>reason.</b> <b>It</b> appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} noted that N. rajah {{produces}} a very extensive root system (for a Nepenthes) and, for this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> is recommended that a wide pot be used to allow for proper development of the root system. This also {{eliminates the need for}} frequent re-potting, which can lead to transplant shock and the eventual death of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Locus 122 and Locus 123 are groups {{located on}} the {{floodplain}} south of the river. Locus 122, although unexcavated, is a compound consisting of a pyramidal mound and a NE–SW oriented plaza, similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands, for which <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> is presumed to date from that period.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{surviving}} prehistoric stone monuments on Exmoor are located on those areas of moorland outside the limits of medieval and post-medieval agriculture. For this <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> is likely that {{the surviving}} sites are not a reliable indicator of the original extent of these sites.|$|E
5|$|This {{extinction}} {{date for}} Babakotia radofilai {{is based on}} a single radiocarbon date from one specimen. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> is hard to tell when this species became extinct or how it is related to other lemur species.|$|E
5|$|A galactic bar {{also has}} the {{potential}} to affect the size of the galactic habitable zone. Galactic bars are thought to grow over time, eventually reaching the corotation radius of the galaxy and perturbing the orbits of the stars located there. High-metallicity stars like our Sun, for example, located at an intermediate location between the low-metallicity galactic halo and the high-radiation galactic center, may be scattered throughout the galaxy, affecting the definition of the galactic habitable zone. It has been suggested that for this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> may be impossible to properly define a galactic habitable zone.|$|E

5|$|BLEU’s {{output is}} always a number between 0 and 1. This value {{indicates}} how similar the candidate text is to the reference texts, with values closer to 1 representing more similar texts. Few human translations will attain a score of 1, since this would indicate that the candidate is identical {{to one of the}} reference translations. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> is not necessary to attain a score of 1. Because there are more opportunities to match, adding additional reference translations will increase the BLEU score.|$|E
5|$|Copper is biostatic, meaning {{bacteria}} {{and many other}} forms of life will not grow on it. For this <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> has long been used to line parts of ships to protect against barnacles and mussels. It was originally used pure, but has since been superseded by Muntz metal and copper-based paint. Similarly, as discussed in copper alloys in aquaculture, copper alloys have become important netting materials in the aquaculture industry because they are antimicrobial and prevent biofouling, even in extreme conditions and have strong structural and corrosion-resistant properties in marine environments.|$|E
5|$|Enforcers {{sometimes}} start {{fights to}} build game momentum {{and provide a}} psychological advantage over the opposing team. These fights usually involve two enforcers, but may involve any player who is agitating the opposition. This type of fight raises morale on the team of the player who wins, and often excites the home crowd. For that <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> {{can also be a}} gamble to start a fight for momentum; if an enforcer loses the fight, the momentum can swing the wrong way.|$|E

Despite slight declines in the British population and some range expansion in Finland, the population is considered overall to be large and stable, and for this <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> is evaluated as a species of least concern by the IUCN.|$|E
5|$|Gyromitra caroliniana, known {{commonly}} as the Carolina {{false morel}} or big red, is an ascomycete fungus {{of the genus}} Gyromitra, within the Pezizales group of fungi. It is found in hardwood forests of the southeastern United States, where it fruits in early spring soon after snowmelt. Although it is collected and eaten by some, there is some suggestion it may contain the toxic compound gyromitrin like its poisonous relative, the false morel G.esculenta, and for this <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> is usually not recommended for consumption.|$|E
5|$|In {{reaction}} to the 2011–17 California drought, all of San Francisco's public fountains were shut off in order to conserve water. Vaillancourt Fountain was turned off in 2014 for the drought, but after that drought ended, the Recreation and Park department cited lack of funds to make repairs to the Vaillancourt Fountain as the <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> had not been reactivated. The estimated cost of rehabilitation to allow water to flow again was approximately US$500,000.|$|E

5|$|Mahshi (pl. mahshi) {{dishes are}} {{composed}} of rice stuffed vegetables such as, eggplants, baby pumpkins, potatoes, carrots and marrows {{as well as a}} variety of leaf vegetables, primarily grape leaves, cabbage leaves and less often chard. Mahshi requires delicacy and time—the main <b>reason</b> <b>it</b> is prepared before the day it is cooked and served. Many female family members participate in the rolling and stuffing of the vegetables, relaxing the amount of individual effort required, with great attention to detail.|$|E
5|$|The L191 (also {{formerly}} {{called the}} SS191) is a tracer cartridge designed for easier bullet spotting in dim light. Combustible chemicals packed {{in the rear}} of the L191 projectile create a light trail visible up to 200m (219yd). The L191 has been manufactured with red and red-on-black tips. The performance and trajectory of the L191 is identical to the SS190. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> is also classified by the ATF as armor-piercing handgun ammunition, and its sale is currently restricted by FN to military and law enforcement customers.|$|E
5|$|The pyramid was {{excavated}} at {{the beginning}} of the 20th century by two different teams who reported conflicting estimates regarding its size and number of subterranean chambers. No artefacts were found over the course of the excavations, and no trace of a burial could be found. For this <b>reason,</b> <b>it</b> is unclear whether the pyramid was used to bury a pharaoh or was abandoned following the premature death of the king.|$|E
