"Mr. Brooks has {{convinced}} me, absolutely, that Richard Whitney {{ranks in the}} highest pantheon of American symbols like Lincoln and Bryan and Melville and Hemingway and Yellow Kid Weil, Buffalo Bill, Horatio Alger, and even Babe Ruth," [...] wrote TK in Harper's magazine, [...] "In him, the upper-class con crested and America's last {{chance to do it}} <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> ended." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dorn {{described}} {{playing a}} Klingon as simple, joking that after hours {{sitting in a}} makeup chair, actors were highly motivated to get the dialogue <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Repeat Klingon Robert O'Reilly told all neophyte Klingons {{that the most important}} part of speaking was to say the lines with belief and [...] "go all the way". When O'Reilly and Dorn's character had a confrontation, makeup artists wiped spittle off each between takes, a consequence of the harsh-sounding language. Todd Bryant (Captain Klaa in [...] ) similarly noted that if an actor was projectile-spitting on others as he spoke Klingon, he was doing a great job.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the end of}} the Harry Potter films, Leung {{said she}} was {{uncertain}} if she wanted to continue a career in acting. However, after attending a drama course at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, she was inspired. In December 2011, she was awarded the role of Jung Chang as her debut stage role in Jung Chang's autobiographical play Wild Swans. In comparing film to live performances, Leung said, [...] "The obvious challenge is of course getting it <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> which is weirdly exciting for me." [...] The play made its world premiere in Cambridge, Massachusetts in February 2012, before returning to Motherwell.|$|E

60|$|The only safe {{thing is}} not to {{introduce}} him, or refer to him at all, I suspect. I have entirely rewritten one book 3 (perhaps 4.) times, changing the plan every time--1200 pages of MS. wasted and burned--and shall tackle it again, one of these years and maybe succeed at last. Therefore you need not expect to get your book <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> Go to work and revamp or rewrite it. God only exhibits his thunder and lightning at intervals, and so they always command attention. These are God's adjectives. You thunder and lightning too much; the reader ceases to get under the bed, by and by.|$|E
6000|$|Whitwell, when he came, {{attempted}} a larger {{view of the}} artist's work, but apparently more out of kindness for him than admiration of the picture. He said he presumed you could not always get {{a thing like that}} just <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> and that you had to keep trying till you did get it; but it paid in the end. Jeff had stolen down from the house with his dog, drawn by the fascination which one we have injured always has for us; when Whitwell suddenly turned upon him and asked, jocularly, [...] "What do you think, Jeff?" [...] the boy could only kick his dog and drive it home, as a means of hiding his feelings.|$|E

60|$|We {{will now}} assume another boy, who also, {{when you first}} {{question}} him, asserts that twice two is four. But with this boy, instead of asking him different questions, you make a practice of asking him the same question every day at breakfast. You find that he says five, or six, or seven, or any other number at random, and you conclude that {{he also does not}} know what twice two is, though by good luck he answered <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time.</b> This boy is like a weather-cock which, instead of being stuck fast, is always going round and round, changing without any change of wind. This boy and weather-cock have the opposite defect to that of the previous pair: they give different responses to stimuli which do not differ in any relevant way.|$|E

She says she's real glad father didn't pick out an American for his second wife, because, {{although}} it turned out all <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> such a thing wouldn't be likely to happen twice. Mrs. Lynde says she thoroughly approves of the match and thinks its likely Miss Lavendar will give up her queer notions and be like other people, now that she's going to be married. But I hope she won't give her queer notions up, teacher, because I like them. And I don't {{want her to be}} like other people. There are too many other people around as it is. YOU know, teacher." ...|$|E
60|$|There {{is a large}} {{field on}} our left rear, and the German gunners have {{the idea that there}} is a {{concealed}} battery therein. They are systematically searching for it. A great shell explodes in the top corner, but gets nothing more solid than a few tons of clay. You can read the mind of Gunner Fritz. 'Try the lower corner!' says he, and up goes the earth-cloud once again. 'Perhaps it's hid about the middle. I'll try.' Earth again, and nothing more. 'I believe I was <b>right</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> after all,' says hopeful Fritz. So another shell comes into the top corner. The field is as full of pits as a Gruyère cheese, but Fritz gets nothing by his perseverance. Perhaps there never was a battery there at all. One effect he obviously did attain. He made several other British batteries exceedingly angry. 'Stop that tickling, Fritz!' was the burden of their cry. Where they were we could no more see than Fritz could, but their constant work was very clear along the German line. We appeared to be using more shrapnel and the Germans more high explosives, but that may have been just the chance of the day. The Vimy Ridge was on our right, and before us was the old French position, with the labyrinth of terrible memories and the long hill of Lorette. When, last year, the French, in a three weeks' battle, fought their way up that hill, it was an exhibition of sustained courage which even their military annals can seldom have beaten.|$|E
