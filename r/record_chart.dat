5|$|Alternative Songs is a <b>record</b> <b>chart</b> that ranks the most-played {{songs on}} American modern rock radio stations. Published {{by the music}} {{industry}} magazine Billboard, it {{was created in the}} midst of the growing popularity of alternative music on rock radio in the late 1980s. As less-established alternative acts were receiving minimal exposure on album-oriented rock (AOR) radio stations, their labels turned to modern rock stations for airplay. Billboard introduced the chart in response to demand within the music industry for consistent information on the commercial performance of alternative music. During the decade, it was known as the Modern Rock Tracks chart and tabulated based on weighted reports from twenty-nine radio stations: eighteen established standard-bearer commercial stations and eleven non-commercial college stations.|$|E

Launched on June21, 2003, the chart is ranked by overall audience impressions (the approximate number of audience impressions made for each play, {{as determined by}} BDS data cross-referenced with Arbitron listener information). While all Christian radio formats are covered by the Christian Songs chart, it is dominated by Christian adult contemporary (Christian AC) radio stations, which cater to a mostly adult audience. As opposed to Christian stations that cater to young audiences, Christian AC stations tend to play hits often and for long periods. As a result, number-one singles on the Christian Songs chart often have lengthy stays at the top position.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is a <b>record</b> <b>chart</b> {{compiled}} {{on behalf}} of the British record industry based on sales of singles in the UK.

The UK Singles Chart originated in 1952, when New Musical Express (NME) published the first chart of singles sales. The positions of all songs are based on week end sale totals, from Sunday to Saturday, but pre-1987, the charts were released on a Tuesday due to the need for manual calculation.|$|E

The data were {{compiled by the}} Billboard chart and research department with information from 70 Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and Puerto Rico. Those radio stations were selected based on their number of listeners, {{and were asked to}} report their playlists for the week. This information was then entered to the Billboard computer system, and points were tabulated for each song. This data are compiled by Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems, which electronically monitors radio stations in more than 120 music markets across the United States. Before this chart's inception, the Latin music information on the magazine was presented only {{in the form of the}} biweekly album sales chart Top Latin Albums, which continues to be listed separately.|$|E
5|$|The UK Albums Chart is {{a weekly}} <b>record</b> <b>chart</b> based on album sales from Sunday to Saturday in the United Kingdom; during the 1990s, {{a total of}} 216 albums reached number one. Until 1 February 1994, the chart was {{compiled}} each week by Gallup– after this date, it was managed by Millward Brown, who expanded the number of sales figures sampled, and extended the use of electronic point of sale machines. From July 1998 onwards, compilation of the chart was overseen by the Chart Information Network, jointly operated by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) and the British Association of Record Dealers. Throughout the decade, the chart was based solely on physical album sales, and each week's number one was first announced on Sunday evenings on The Radio 1 Chart Show.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} <b>record</b> <b>chart</b> in the United Kingdom. Until 1983, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a two-week break each Christmas. The BMRB used motorcycle couriers to collect the sales figures taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. This data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Music Week. On 4 January 1983, the chart was taken over by Gallup who expanded the chart from the Top 75 to the Top 100 and began the introduction of computerised tills which automated the data collection process. The chart was based entirely on sales of physical singles from retail outlets and announced on Tuesday until October 1987, when the Top 40 was revealed each Sunday, due to the new automated process.|$|E

Overall, the album {{has sold more than}} ten million copies worldwide. With the commercial success it achieved, Something to Remember set a trend of releasing ballad albums afterward, such as the 1996 albums Love Songs by Elton John and If We Fall in Love Tonight by Rod Stewart.|$|E
5|$|The UK Singles Chart is the {{official}} <b>record</b> <b>chart</b> in the United Kingdom. In the 1970s, it was compiled weekly by the British Market Research Bureau (BMRB) {{on behalf of the}} British record industry with a one-week break each Christmas. Prior to 1969 many music papers compiled their own sales charts but, on 15 February 1969, the BMRB was commissioned in a joint venture by the BBC and Record Retailer to compile the chart. BMRB compiled the first chart from postal returns of sales logs from 250 record shops. The sampling cost approximately £52,000 and shops were randomly chosen and submitted figures for sales taken up to the close of trade on Saturday. The data was compiled on Monday and given to the BBC on Tuesday to be announced on Johnnie Walker's afternoon show and later published in Record Retailer (rebranded Music Week in 1972). However, the BMRB often struggled to have the full sample of sales figures returned by post. The 1971 postal strike meant that data had to be collected by telephone but this was deemed inadequate for a national chart, and by 1973 the BMRB was using motorcycle couriers to collect sales figures.|$|E
