Point-to-point teleprinter equipment was used to send messages which were stored at the receiving end on punched paper tape at a <b>relay</b> <b>center.</b> A human operator at the center removed the message tape from the receiving machine, read the addressing information, and then sent it toward its destination on appropriate outbound point-to-point teleprinter link.

The connectivity between these components is topographically organized in a frequency-specific manner. It is known that the organization is well-established {{from the beginning of}} the circuit development. However, little is still known about the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of connectivity in the auditory circuit. Homeobox transcription factors of the Hox gene family are known for their involvement in early anterior-posterior axis patterning of neuronal progenitors in the hindbrain. Recent evidence indicates that they also play important roles in late aspects of neuronal development and establishment of topographic circuitry. Moreover, a mutation in the HOXA 2 gene has been recently shown to be responsible for hearing deficits in humans.

40|$|Serious organic brain lesions {{have long}} been {{accepted}} as being the probable basis for such obvious childhood disorders as epilepsy, cerebral palsy, and gross mental retardation. Upon physical and EEG (electroencephalogram) examination these children usually show consistent "hard " signs of neurological damage which may even indicate {{the location of the}} damaged area. In the past couple of decades the neurological basis for hyperkinesis and dyslexia has been proposed and hesitantly accepted. These problems have been called minimal brain dys-function (MBD). The very term is unfortunate since the word "minimal " implies that it is inconsequential. A more appropriate label would have been "subtle " brain dysfunction. Conservative physicians opposed including these disturbances with the more obvious organic disorders because the neurological findings are more variable, vague, and transitory. For this reason they are called "soft " signs. They indicate disturbed integration of CNS (central nervous system) activity, perhaps in <b>relay</b> <b>centers</b> {{at the top of the}} brain stem.

Rats of both sexes (n =  30), with an average weight of 200  g, were randomly assigned into treatment (n =  15) and control (n =  15) groups. Rats in the treatment group each received the recommended daily dose of 600  mg/ 70  kg (1. 71  mg/ 200  g) of body weight of efavirenz daily for 30 days, while the control group rats received an equal volume of distilled water alone daily for 30 days. The rats were sacrificed after 30 days, and the IC and MGB were carefully removed for further biochemical assays. These analyses indicated that levels of malonyldialdehyde (MDA), a non-enzyme biomarker of oxidative stress, were significantly higher (p <  0. 05) whereas levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly lower (p <  0. 05) in treated tissues than in control tissues.

40|$|We studied native point defects {{as well as}} Eu and Dy ion doping in CaS by {{the simple}} DFT + Hubbard U method. The {{electronic}} properties and formation energies of native point defects and dopants have been discussed. We found the neutral S vacancy has the lowest energy of 0. 62 eV under the Ca-rich limit. The Schottky pair is another dominant defect with a cost of 1. 51 eV per defect site from S-rich to Ca-rich chemical potential limits. Our calculations on the thermodynamic transition levels confirm the experimental observed intrinsic blue two-peak broad band emissions stimulated by near-infrared range irradiation for undoped CaS. Both Eu and Dy show an energetic favorable trend to be substitutionally doped in the CaS lattice. All of the positive charge states of the Eu ion contribute localized recombination trapping level in the gap while having very deep donor transition levels. The neutral state of Dy contributes to the occupied 4 f level localized 1. 3 eV below the conduction band edge with very shallow donor type transition level (0 /+) of 0. 56 eV below the conduction band. All of the positive charge states of Dy have two shallow 5 d levels with 0. 4 and 0. 6 eV below the conduction band. In this work, we further analyzed that the Dy dopant contributed deeper trap levels in the CaS materials that can store the electron carriers with more evenly, wider, and deeper range of levels distributed so that they lengthen the decay-time of the persistent luminescence. The related 980 nm photo-stimulated luminescence is actualized {{with the help of}} native defects like VS 0, VS +, and STK- as <b>relay</b> <b>centers</b> for a possible up-converted luminescence.

50|$|The whole {{conflict}} between Indian and Pakistani television {{can be traced}} back to the mid-20th century. On 14 August 1947, Pakistan got its independence. Subsequently, from the 15th of August, Radio Pakistan Lahore became a hostile station. This rang alarm bells in New Delhi and since high-powered transmitters were unavailable in India, two low-powered 1-kilowatt medium-wave transmitters each were dispatched to Amritsar and Jalandhar. Thus, All India Radio Jalandhar-Amritsar came into existence. This arrangement continued for five years. Soon after independence the authorities in Pakistan increased the power of Lahore radio station from 10 kilowatts to 50 kilowatts. In 1953, All India Radio also installed a 50-kilowatt medium-wave transmitter at a place called Goraya, located equidistant from Ludhiana and Jalandhar. This arrangement continued until the 1990s. Pakistan added a 100-kilowatt medium-wave transmitter to its existing 50-kilowatt station in Lahore in 1965. India opened a 1-kilowatt medium-wave station at Chandigarh in 1965. Another radio station was to be opened at Amritsar, but due to the 1965 war with Pakistan, the idea was shelved. In the meanwhile, Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television Service increased its presence in the border areas with India. Radio Pakistan then slowly and steadily kept opening new radio stations in the cities of Rawalpindi, Multan, Bahawalpur, Faisalabad, Mianwali, Islamabad and Sialkot. Pakistani television also dotted the entire border areas with Punjab, India with powerful transmitters. India started its second phase of expansion of broadcasting services in Punjab during the 1990s. During the 1990s, both the cities of Bathinda and Patiala possessed <b>relay</b> <b>centers</b> for Doordarshan and also got FM transmitters of All India Radio. The mother station at Jalandhar was upgraded with two high-powered medium-wave transmitters along with a 10-kilowatt FM transmitter. All India Radio Chandigarh was strengthened with a 10-kilowatt high-altitude transmitter at Kasauli, extending its range up to 110 miles radius. The construction of the Fazilka TV Tower followed in 1996 until its completion in 2007.|$|R

50|$|However, {{where the}} corticospinal tract is {{dominant}} (as in primates), the rubrospinal tract {{may be considered}} to be vestigial. Therefore, here the red nucleus is less important in motor functions than in many other mammals. However, the crawling of babies is controlled by the red nucleus, as is arm swinging in typical walking. The red nucleus may play an additional role in controlling muscles of the shoulder and upper arm via projections of its magnocellular part. In humans, the red nucleus also has sparse control over hands, as the rubrospinal tract is more involved in large muscle movement such as that for arms (but not the legs, as the tract terminates in the superior thoracic region of the spinal cord). Fine control of the fingers is not modified by the functioning of the red nucleus (rather it relies on the corticospinal tract).

His widow invited Tara Singh S/o Mutsada Singh of Fatehgarh Churian, Tehsil Batala of Kahnaya Misal to come & marry her daughter and succeed her husband and took the whole of Nand Singh's possession henceforth. Pathankot remained under the control of Kahnaya Misal till 1807 A.D. when Jaimal Singh had to yield his possession to Maharaja Ranjit Singh.The change of name from Paithan to Pathankot took place under the leadership of Sardar Gurbax Singh Kahnaya {{during the second half of}} the 19th century.Maharaja Rabjit Singh had 46 wife's Maharaja married a Mohamandan prostitute of Amritsar in 1802 A.D. with whom the fell in violent love. Moran enjoyed Ranjit Singh's confidence for many years and he had struck gold and silver coins in her name which were called Moran Shahi Sikkey. Suddenly in August 1811 A.D. Moran was sent to Pathankot in a Palkin which was granted to her as Jagir. It is believed that she spent last days of her life at Pathankot.After the defeat in the first Sikh- Anglo War, Pathankot along with 83 villages were attached with the newly created District of Kangra, by the Britishers in the year 18456 A.D. and remained as such till the formation of Distt.
