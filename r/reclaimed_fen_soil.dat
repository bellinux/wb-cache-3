However, due to the high productivity of grassland on organic soil {{with a history of}} intensive management, stocking at low rates may not allow an adequate balance of herbage production and utilisation. In the present study we examined the agronomic performance of an established (6 -year) extensive cattle grazing system on a <b>reclaimed</b> <b>fen</b> grassland site in north-western Germany {{during the course of the}} grazing season. We regularly quantified the amount and energy content of herbage on offer based on compressed sward height (CSH), the spatial extent of patches of various degrees of grazing intensity (heavily or moderately grazed, non-grazed), and the chemical composition of the herbage, and assessed energy uptake and livestock performance in terms of live weight gain of the cattle. We deduced herbage utilisation from these data and quantified functional relationships between cattle grazing and the properties of the sward. Our data show that there was an inadequate balance between quantity and quality of forage on offer on the one hand, and demand and forage consumption by livestock on the other. As a result, live weight gains showed a seasonal pattern with a minimum in summer. The amount of energy on offer per animal unit had a significant effect on the sward structure, i. e. on both the area proportion of heavily grazed patches and the heterogeneity of CSH. These findings may be of interest in the context of conservation management of <b>reclaimed</b> <b>fen</b> grasslands, as they may contribute to the design of grazing regimes aiming to create particular sward structures, e. g., to provide habitat for individual target species...|$|R

In situ N 2 O emissions of a near pH neutral pristine <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> in Finnish Lapland were marginal during gas chamber measurements. However, nitrate and ammonium fertilization significantly stimulated in situ N 2 O emissions. Stimulation with nitrate was stronger than with ammonium. N 2 O was produced and subsequently consumed in gas chambers. In unsupplemented anoxic microcosms, <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> produced N 2 O only when acetylene was added to block nitrous oxide reductase, suggesting complete denitrification.

Denitrifier diversity was assessed by analyses of narG, nirK/nirS, and nosZ (encoding nitrate-, nitrite-, and nitrous oxide reductases, respectively) by barcoded amplicon pyrosequencing. Analyses of ~ 14, 000 quality filtered sequences indicated up to 25 species-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and up to 359 OTUs at 97 % sequence similarity, suggesting diverse denitrifiers. Phylogenetic analyses revealed clusters distantly related to publicly available sequences, suggesting hitherto unknown denitrifiers. Representatives of species-level OTUs were affiliated with sequences of unknown soil bacteria and Actinobacterial, Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, and Delta-Proteobacterial sequences. Comparison of the 4 gene markers at 97 % similarity indicated a higher diversity of narG than for the other gene markers based on Shannon indices and observed number of OTUs.

40|$|Fen peatlands are {{specific}} wetland ecosystems containing high soil organic carbon (SOC). There {{is a general}} lack of knowledge about the microbial communities that abound in these systems. We examined the microbial activity and community structure in two <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> differing in SOC content sampled from the Ljubljana Marsh under different seasonal conditions. Substrate-induced respiration and dehydrogenase activity were used as indicators of total microbial activity. Both methods indicated higher microbial activities in the <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> with the higher SOC content on all dates of sampling. To determine whether the differences in microbial activity were associated with differences in the microbial community structures, terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) of bacterial 16 S rRNA genes was performed. Comparison of the T-RFLP profiles revealed very similar community structures in both fens and in the two seasonal extremes investigated. This suggested a stable community structure in the two fens, which is not affected by the SOC content or seasonal variation. In addition, a bacterial 16 S ribosomal RNA gene based clone library was prepared from the <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> with the higher SOC content. Out of 114 clones analysed, approximately 53 % belonged to the Proteobacteria, 23 % to the Acidobacteria, 21 % to a variety of other taxa, and less than 3 % were affiliated with the Firmicutes.

Both the <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> isolates and the clean room strain revealed versatile physiological capacities in N-transformation processes by performing heterotrophic nitrification, respiratory ammonification and denitrification activity. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the investigated isolates belonged to the genus Paenibacillus. Sequence similarities lower than 97 % in comparison to established species indicated a separate species position. Except for the peptidoglycan type (A 4 alpha L-Lys–D-Asp), chemotaxonomic features of the isolates matched the genus description, but differences in several physiological characteristics separated them from related species and supported their novel species status. Despite a high 16 S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the clean room isolate ES_MS 17 ^T and the representative <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> isolate N 3 / 975 ^T, DNA–DNA hybridization studies revealed genetic differences at the species level.

This thesis studies their seed ecology, {{focusing on}} the interaction between environmental temperature and germination. To this end we conduct laboratory germination experiments with calcareous spring fen species to characterize the temperature dimension of the germination niche and identify specific germination strategies. We explore the special thermal characteristics of <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> and their consequences on germination. Using the Cantabrian endemic Centaurium somedanum as a study species, we investigate the germination ecology of spring specialists and perform a common garden experiment supported by ISSR fingerprinting to determine the genetic and environmental influences on seed dormancy variation. Based on our results, we propose two germination strategies. Fen species generally follow a warm strategy, characterized by a heat response capable of overriding dormancy during episodes of unusual heat. Spring species lack the heat response and germinate only at cool temperatures. <b>Fen</b> <b>soils</b> have a buffer effect that makes their temperature less extreme than predicted, especially during the night and in winter. However, the germination niche breadth of fen species shows plasticity and is narrower in regions with harsher winters. The germination ecology of the spring specialist C. somedanum departs from the general germination patterns of its genus, showing morphophysiological dormancy and cool germination. This species has a local dormancy cline that {{is related to the}} genetic composition of the populations and to site climate, but that also responds in the short term to the seed maturation environment.

Wetlands are especially diverse and are {{an area of}} concern in the Boreal Zone of northern Alberta, Canada, as they are affected by surface mining for oil sands. This thesis describes terrestrial and semi-terrestrial invertebrate community composition within the Sandhill Fen Watershed, the first-ever landform constructed on a foundation of oil sands tailings, in the post-mining landscape. Soil attributes and plant community composition were associated with spatial variation in invertebrate abundance, richness and composition at low-elevation (peat dominated) and upland (forest soil dominated) locations within Sandhill Fen, and in 8 reference fens. Peat-dominated sites in Sandhill Fen were typically wet, saline, and slightly acidic and supported a typical herbaceous wetland plant community. The invertebrates found in this habitat were those commonly associated with wetland plant communities and were similar in composition to invertebrates in Carex-dominated (‘rich’) reference fens. The Litter-Fermentation-Humic (LFH) soil dominated upland sites were drier, less saline, had a meadow plant community, and an invertebrate assemblage that was more variable than the peat community and distinct from the fauna of reference fens. Sandhill fen invertebrate abundance was equivalent to that of reference fens. Family richness in Sandhill Fen exceeded that of reference fen sites, likely reflecting associations with the greater plant diversity of low-elevation plus upland sites combined. Sandhill <b>Fen</b> <b>soils</b> were more saline than reference <b>fen</b> <b>soils,</b> but the plant community and invertebrate community of low-elevation peat sites fell {{within the range of}} variation observed in rich reference fens.

This {{statement}} should not however, be allowed to give an impression of great altitude. This is a region of very gentle relief. The fen edge is at an altitude of about seven metres and 2½ kilometres away, the highest ground in the wood is at about 58 metres. The Jurassic beds (clay and sandy clay) are capped by glacial till or boulder clay, left from glaciations that occurred in the British Isles during the Anglian and Wolstonian stages respectively1. In former times, this till made the land too difficult for the early farmers to use as arable land and too wet and tenacious to be ideal for pasture. It is natural therefore, to find that much of it has been left as woodland, which was in itself, a valuable resource for fuel and constructional material. As far south as Bourne though, the remaining strip of glacial till is narrow and most of Bourne wood is on the Jurassic Kellaways clay and sand.|$|R
40|$|A {{large share}} of peatlands in northwestern Germany is drained for {{agricultural}} purposes, thereby emitting high amounts of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In order to quantify the climatic impact of <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> in dairy farming systems of northern Germany, GHG exchange and forage yield were determined on four experimental sites which differed in terms of management and drainage intensity: (a)  rewetted and unutilized grassland (UG), (b)  intensive and wet grassland (GW), (c)  intensive and moist grassland (GM) and (d)  arable forage cropping (AR). Net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO 2 and fluxes of CH 4 and N 2 O were measured using closed manual chambers. CH 4 fluxes were significantly affected by groundwater level (GWL) and soil temperature, whereas N 2 O fluxes showed a significant relation {{to the amount of}} nitrate in top soil. Annual balances of all three gases, as well as the global warming potential (GWP), were significantly correlated to mean annual GWL. A 2 -year mean GWP, combined from CO 2 –C eq. of NEE, CH 4 and N 2 O emissions, as well as C input (slurry) and C output (harvest), was 3. 8, 11. 7, 17. 7 and 17. 3  Mg CO 2 –C eq.  ha − 1  a − 1 for sites UG, GW, GM and AR, respectively (standard error (SE) 2. 8, 1. 2, 1. 8, 2. 6).

The carbon footprint of agricultural commodities grown on <b>fen</b> <b>soils</b> depended on long-term drainage intensity rather than type of management, but management and climate strongly influenced interannual on-site variability. However, arable forage production revealed a high uncertainty of yield and therefore was an unsuitable land use option.

Our goal was to investigate the mechanisms of release from solid to solution phase, the mobility, and the transformation of arsenic species in a <b>fen</b> <b>soil.</b> In methanol–water extracts, monomethylarsonic acid, dimethylarsinic acid, trimethylarsine oxide, arsenobetaine, and two unknown organic arsenic species were found with concentrations up to 14 ng As g− 1 at the surface horizon. Arsenate is the dominant species at the 0 – 30 cm depth, whereas arsenite predominated at the 30 – 70 cm depth. Only up to 2. 2 % of total arsenic in fen was extractable with methanol–water. In porewaters, depth gradient spatial variation of arsenic species, pH, redox potentials, and the other chemical parameters along the profile was observed in June together with high proportion of organic arsenic species (up to 1. 2 μg As L− 1, 70 % of total arsenic). Tetramethylarsonium ion and an unknown organic arsenic species were additionally detected in porewaters at deeper horizons. In comparison, the arsenic speciation in porewaters in April was homogeneous with depth and no organic arsenic species were found. Thus, the occurrence of microbial methylation of arsenic in fen was demonstrated for the first time. The 10 times elevated total arsenic concentrations in porewaters in June compared to April were accompanied by elevated concentrations of total iron, lower concentrations of sulfate and the presence of ammonium and phosphate. The low proportion of methanol–water extractable total arsenic suggests a generally low mobility of arsenic in <b>fen</b> <b>soils.</b> The release of arsenic from solid to solution phases in fen is dominantly controlled by dissolution of iron oxides, redox transformation, and methylation of arsenic, driven by microbial activity in the growing season.

These include differences in mineral content, pH, CaCO 3 levels, degree of peat decomposition, electrical conductivity and oxygenation of the waters that feed the fens. Carici-Agrostietum caninae is a homogenous plant association adapted to extreme habitat conditions. It is characterized by a very narrow range of essential soil and feeding water parameters. Valeriano-Caricetum flavae is a highly diverse association. Considerable diversity both in terms of plant species and vegetation structure reflects very wide ranges in the properties of soil and feeding water.

Drought retarded methane production after rewetting for days to weeks and promoted methanotrophic activity. Based on isotope and flux budgets, aerobic soil respiration contributed 32 ? 96 % in the wet and 86 ? 99 % in the other treatments. Drying and rewetting did not shift methanogenic pathways according to ? 13 C ratios of CH 4 and CO 2. Although ? 13 C ratios indicated a prevalence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, free energies of this process were small and often positive on the horizon scale, suggesting that methane was produced very locally. Fresh plant-derived carbon input apparently supported respiration in the rhizosphere and sustained methanogenesis in the unsaturated zone according to a 13 C-CO 2 labelling experiment. The study documents that drying and rewetting in a rich <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> may have little effect on methanogenic pathways but result in rapid shifts between methanogenesis and methanotrophy. Such shifts may be promoted by roots and soil heterogeneity, as hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis occurred locally even when conditions were not conducive for this process in the bulk peat...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the effect}} of {{long-term}} drainage of peatland areas is helpful in future peatland management and regulations of water conditions. The aim of this work {{was to assess the}} current state of <b>fen</b> peatland <b>soils</b> in the Grójecka Valley (eastern part of the Wielkopolskie voivodeship, central Poland), affected by long-term agricultural use (pastures, meadows) since the 1960 s and potentially by lignite open pit mining industry (KWB Konin) since 1980 s. Field studies were carried out in 2015 in selected <b>fen</b> peatland areas. <b>Soil</b> material for laboratory analysis was collected from genetic horizons from four soil profiles. The surface horizons of studied organic and organo-mineral soils were built with well-developed moorsh material. They were classified as medium moorshiefied – MtII (profile 1, 3 and 4) and strongly moorshiefied – MtIII (profile 2). Obtained results of physical and physico-chemical analysis indicate that long-term peatland utilization connected with potential impact of the lignite mining, transformed mainly the upper horizons of studied organic and organo-mineral soils. However, despite obvious strong human impact on peatlands ecosystems, we cannot exclude the climate variables, what should be confirmed by long-term monitoring program. Furthermore, presented paper indicated that new subtype moorsh-muddy soils (in Polish: gleby murszowo-mułowe) within the type of gleyic soils should be implemented in the next version of Polish Soil Classification...|$|R
40|$|Wetlands are {{sources of}} denitrification-derived nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Thus, the denitrifier {{community}} of an N 2 O-emitting fen (pH 4. 7 to 5. 2) was investigated. N 2 O was produced and consumed to subatmospheric concentrations in unsupplemented anoxic soil microcosms. Total cell counts and most probable numbers of denitrifiers approximated 1011 cells·gDW− 1 (where DW is dry weight) and 108 cells·gDW− 1, respectively, in both 0 - to 10 -cm and 30 - to 40 -cm depths. Despite this uniformity, depth-related maximum reaction rate (vmax) values for denitrification in anoxic microcosms ranged from 1 to 24 and − 19 to − 105 nmol N 2 O h− 1 · gDW− 1, with maximal values {{occurring in the}} upper soil layers. Denitrification was enhanced by substrates that might be formed via fermentation in anoxic microzones of soil. N 2 O approximated 40 % of total nitrogenous gases produced at in situ pH, which was likewise the optimal pH for denitrification. Gene libraries of narG and nosZ (encoding nitrate reductase and nitrous oxide reductase, respectively) from <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> DNA yielded 15 and 18 species-level operational taxonomic units, respectively, many of which displayed phylogenetic novelty and were not closely related to cultured organisms. Although statistical analyses of narG and nosZ sequences indicated that the upper 20 cm of soil contained the highest denitrifier diversity and species richness, terminal {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} analyses of narG and nosZ revealed only minor differences in denitrifier community composition from a soil depth of 0 to 40 cm. The collective data indicate that the regional fen harbors novel, highly diverse, acid-tolerant denitrifier communities capable of complete denitrification and consumption of atmospheric N 2 O at in situ pH...|$|R
40|$|Peatlands {{contain a}} carbon stock of global concern and {{significantly}} {{contribute to the}} global methane burden. The impact of drought and rewetting on carbon cycling in peatland ecosystems is thus currently debated. We studied the impact of experimental drought and rewetting on intact monoliths from a temperate fen {{over a period of}} ~ 300 days, using a permanently wet treatment and two treatments undergoing drought for 50 days. In one of the mesocosms, vegetation had been removed. Net production of CH 4 was calculated from mass balances in the peat and emission using static chamber measurements. Results were compared to 13 C isotope budgets of CO 2 and CH 4 and energy yields of acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Drought retarded methane production after rewetting for days to weeks and promoted methanotrophic activity. Based on isotope and flux budgets, aerobic soil respiration contributed 32 – 96 % in the wet treatment and 86 – 99 % in the other treatments. Drying and rewetting did not shift methanogenic pathways according to δ 13 C ratios of CH 4 and CO 2. Although δ 13 C ratios indicated a prevalence of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, free energies of this process were small and often positive on the horizon scale. This suggests that methane was produced very locally.

40|$|In this study, an isotope {{dilution}} method {{specifically designed to}} detect anaerobic methane oxidation (AOM) in methanogenic wetland soils was developed.   A range of anaerobic soils and sediments were screened for AOM potential.   Methane and carbon dioxide emissions were investigated in strictly anoxic microcosms to which 13 C-labelled methane was added, {{and changes in the}} concentration and 12 C/ 13 C isotope ratios of methane and carbon dioxide were subsequently measured and used to calculate the separate components of the methane flux.   The results indicated that certain soils can oxidise methane oxidation anaerobically.   The clearest evidence for AOM was provided by minerotrophic <b>fen</b> <b>soil</b> (pH 6. 0) in Bin Forest, which is derived from ultra-basic and serpentine till.   In the Bin Forest fresh soil anoxic microcosms, net consumption of methane was observed, and the amount of headspace 13 C-CO 2 increased at a greater rate than the 12 + 13 C-CO 2, further proof of methane oxidation.   Net methane production was observed in soil from Murder Moss, an alkaline site, pH 6. 5, with a strong calcareous influence, but the 13 C-CH 4 and 13 C-CO 2 data indicated co-occurrence of AOM in this soil.   Anaerobic methane oxidation was not observed in the other, lower pH soils.   There was no evidence that amending anoxic slurries with up to 5. 0 mM sulphate or  nitrate solutions promoted anaerobic methane oxidation.   Overall, this study provided good evidence for anaerobic methane oxidation in some wetland soils, and suggested that models predicting methane flux from wetland soils to the atmosphere could be improved by better understanding of the process.
