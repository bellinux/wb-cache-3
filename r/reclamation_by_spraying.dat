40|$|The {{composite}} powders of Ag-NiO {{were prepared}} <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis from Ag and Ni loading Versatic Acid 10, {{which was used}} for the separation of metals as an extractant. The external shapes and the internal structures of the obtained composite powders were investigated by using SEM, XRD and EPMA. The composite powders were secondary agglomerates with the particle size of several μm ∼ 10 μm and agglomerate powders were composed of some spherical particles with the size of one micron or less as observed by SEM photographs. The composite powders prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis from the organic phase were the powders comprising Ag-NiO from the analysis of XRD. The Ag-NiO composite powders were made of the Ag layer in the internal region and the Ag-NiO composite layer in the external region from the result of the EPMA analysis. The structure of the obtained powders was different from the internal structure of the composite powders prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis from the metal nitrate solution. The new powder production process where the separation with solvent extraction was carried out, followed <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, was proposed. In this process the composite powders were prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis from the organic phase loading and refining the targeted elements from the impure raw materials like wastes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEfficient {{inverted}} polymer {{solar cells}} (PSCs) were fabricated with ZnO electron transport layers (ETLs) prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis, {{which is a}} simple and cost efficient method producing a thin oxide layer <b>by</b> direct <b>spray</b> of precursor on hot substrate. To investigate the effect of substrate temperature on the structural and optical properties as well as performance of PSCs, ZnO ETLs were fabricated <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis on hot substrate controlled at 150, 250, and 350 °C, respectively. The PSC with ZnO prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis at 150 °C exhibited poor power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 0. 94 % due to the mis-matched energy level and microscopic roughness of ZnO ETL. On the other hand, enhanced efficiency of 2. 99 % and 3. 22 % was obtained by using ZnO prepared <b>by</b> <b>spray</b> pyrolysis at 250 and 350 °C, respectively. Enhancement of efficiency at higher temperature is attributed to better matching of ZnO coated ITO work-function with the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of PCBM {{and the formation of}} smooth and homogeneous polycrystalline ZnO, resulting in improved interfacial property and electron transport. In the durability test, inverted ZnO solar cell was retained above 80 % during 9 days in an ambient atmosphere without any encapsulation, while conventional solar cells showed dramatic decrease of efficiency...|$|R
