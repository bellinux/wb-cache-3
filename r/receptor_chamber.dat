30|$|At {{the last}} {{sampling}} time point, the receptor medium was drawn {{out of the}} <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> completely. Each diffusion cell was dismantled to analyze the amount of test compound in the different compartments: to determine the remained amount of test compound on the skin surface, the skin was washed by alternately pipetting 1  mL of the corresponding solvent of the test substance {{up and down on}} the skin surface and wiping the skin with cotton swabs dampened into the solvent. This procedure was repeated two times, followed by wiping the skin surface with one dry cotton swab. All cotton swabs, pipettes, and pipetted solvents of one diffusion cell were collected in one vessel and extracted in the corresponding extraction fluid (water for the extraction of caffeine and 100  % ethanol for the extraction of testosterone). This step represented the first skin wash. In the next step, the donor chamber was removed from the skin surface and wiped at the bottom with a cotton swab soaked in solvent, followed by a dry cotton swab. The donor chambers were extracted with the cotton swabs and the covering piece of Fixomull® in a second series of vessels. The skin was wiped by two cotton swabs (one soaked in solvent and one dry) a second time for extraction. In order to determine the amount of test compound within the skin in case of radiolabeled studies, the skin was removed from the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> and digested in 8  mL of a tissue solubilizer (Soluene® 350, PerkinElmer Health Sciences B.V., Groningen, the Netherlands). For determination of the amount of test compound in the receptor medium in addition to aliquots at the end of exposure, the receptor chambers were extracted with the covering piece of Parafilm M® on the inlet and the magnetic stir bars in the corresponding extraction fluid. Volumes of extraction fluids and aliquots of receptor media at various time points were calculated by subtraction of net weights from filled weights of all vials.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of the diffusion of phenolic compounds through virgin and aged polyethylene (PE) films. The study considers five chlorophenols contaminants (4 -chlorophenol, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, 2, 4, 6 -tricholophenol, 2, 3, 5, 6 -tetrachlorophenol, and pentachlorophenol) that {{are known to be}} toxic even at very low concentrations. The concentration dynamics in the source and <b>receptor</b> <b>chambers</b> of the diffusion cells is interpreted using the numerical code Pollute. For virgin PE film, partition coefficients ranged from 0. 68 to 278, which corresponded to 4 -chlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, respectively. Diffusion coefficients ranged from 1. 0 3 1014 to 2. 7 3 1013 m 2 /s, which corresponded to pentachlorophenol and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, respectively. The study also looked at how the partition and diffusion coefficients were affected by the aqueous solubility, n-octanol-water partition coefficient, molecular diameter, and molecular weight. The trends observed in this study are similar to those found for diffusion of phenolic compounds through PE geomembranes. The results also revealed trends that differ from those previously reported for diffusion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through geomembranes. The existing empirical relationships for VOCs are not applicable except for calculating how the diffusion coefficient evolves as a function of solubility in water. Increasing the number of chlorine atoms on the phenolic nucleus causes an increase in the partition coefficient, which is tentatively attributed to the polarity of the molecules under study...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} test if {{electrical}} resistance measurement {{is suitable for}} skin integrity assessment, impedance (resistance to an alternating current) data were collected as follows: the donor chamber was filled up with amphibian Ringer’s solution and the electrodes of an LCR meter (L = inductance, C = capacitance, R = resistance; LCR Meter ST 2822, Sourcetronic GmbH, Bremen, Germany) were placed into the electrolyte solution within <b>receptor</b> and donor <b>chamber,</b> fixed in their position to maintain {{the distance to the}} skin surface throughout the experiment. Impedances were measured both at a frequency of 100 and 1000 Ω for each skin sample. For calculating the impedance value of the skin itself, the inherent impedance of each chamber, filled with the corresponding receptor medium, was subtracted from the measured impedances when the skin samples were clamped into the diffusion cells. The receptor medium within each donor chamber was removed and the surface of the skin was gently wiped with a cotton swab in a standardized way to remove the remaining medium.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: An {{epithelial}} {{ovarian cancer}} cell line constitutively expressing the androgen receptor {{was created to}} evaluate the mechanism and effects of androgen receptor activation on epithelial ovarian cancer cell invasion. Methods: Immunocytochemistry and Western blot analyses confirmed androgen <b>receptor</b> expression. Boyden <b>chamber</b> invasion assays were performed using cells treated with the androgen receptor ligands medroxyprogesterone acetate or dihydrotestosterone. The matrix metalloproteinases associated with invasion were investigated using zymographic assays. Results: Androgen receptormediated inva-sion is ligand dependent. While both medroxyprogesterone acetate and dihydrotestosterone signal through androgen receptor, medroxyprogesterone acetate is more effective at stimulating invasion of epithelial ovar-ian cancer cells. Unlike the wild-type epithelial ovarian cancer cells, this increase in invasion in androgen receptorþ epithelial ovarian cancer cells {{does not seem to}} be dependent on matrix metalloproteinase 2 or 9 activation. Conclusion: Although classified as a progestin, medroxyprogesterone acetate has significant androgenic activity unique from the pure androgen dihydrotestosterone. Our studies suggest that pharmacologic doses of medroxyprogesterone acetate may actually increase the invasive potential of epithelial ovarian cancer cells.

METHODS: The experiments {{were carried out}} using scleral samples and a Franz-type vertical diffusion cell. A suspension containing TA was prepared {{and placed in the}} donor chamber. The concentration of TA in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay and expressed as a percentage relative to TA concentration dissolved in the donor chamber. Control experiments using a commercial TA suspension were performed. RESULTS: TA (+/-SEM) dissolved in the donor suspension was 10. 69 +/- 1. 28 microg/ml. The diffusion rate of TA varied from 30 % after 1 day to 72 % after 4 days, after which equilibrium was reached. The human scleral permeability coefficient (P(s) +/- SEM) was 1. 47 +/- 0. 17 x 10 (- 5) cm/s. CONCLUSIONS: TA crossed human sclera.

40|$|Purpose. The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were (a) to explore the potential of transdermal reverse iontophoresis for therapeutic drug monitoring and (b) to develop an internal standard calibration procedure so as to render the technique completely noninvasive. Methods. A series of in vitro iontophoresis experiments was performed in which the subdermal concentration of sodium valproate was varied from 21 M to 1 mM. Glutamic acid was also introduced into the subdermal donor at a fixed concentration {{to act as an}} internal standard for the calibration method. Results. Both valproate and glutamate anions were recovered, as expected, at the anodal <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber.</b> The iontophoretic extraction flux of valproate was linearly correlated with the subdermal concentration. Glutamate flux was constant. It follows that the ratio of extracted fluxes (valproate/glutamate) was directly dependent upon (a) the subdermal valproate concentration and (b) the subdermal concentration ratio (valproate/glutamate), offering a means, thereby, to a completely noninvasive methodology. Conclusions. This work demonstrates the potential of reverse iontophoresis for noninvasive therapeutic monitoring. The simultaneous quantification of the analyte of interest and of an internal standard renders the withdrawal of a blood sample unnecessary...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this work}} was to {{increase}} the amount of acyclovir (ACV) in the basal epidermis, site of Herpes virus simplex infections, using microparticles as carriers. Poly(d,l-lactic–co-glycolic acid) microparticles loaded with ACV were prepared using a solvent evaporation technique. ACV distribution into porcine skin after topical application of microparticles for 6, 24 and 88 h, was determined by horizontal slicing of the skin. An ACV suspension served for comparison. The results showed that, at 6 and 24 h, the quantity of the drug in the basal epidermis with the microparticles, is similar to that obtained with the ACV suspension. However, after 88 h, the ACV reservoir in the basal epidermis was higher with the microparticles compared with the control suspension. This could be explained by the controlled drug release produced by the vector in the basal epidermis. Besides, at 88 h the amount of ACV detected in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> of the diffusion cells was much lower with the microparticles than with the suspension. This type of carrier can improve acyclovir topical therapy since it increases drug retention in the basal epidermis and consequently increases the time intervals between doses...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{investigate}} the topical iontophoresis of valaciclovir (VCV) {{as a means}} to improve cutaneous aciclovir (ACV) delivery. METHODS: ACV and VCV electrotransport experiments were conducted using excised porcine skin in vitro. RESULTS: While the charged nature of the prodrug, VCV, enabled it to be more efficiently iontophoresed into the skin than the parent molecule, ACV, only the latter was detectable in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber,</b> suggesting that VCV was enzymatically cleaved into the active metabolite during skin transit. Iontophoresis of VCV was significantly more efficient than that of ACV; the cumulative permeation of ACV after 1, 2 and 3 h of VCV iontophoresis at 0. 5 mA cm(- 2) and using an aqueous 2 mM (approximately 0. 06 %) formulation was 20 +/- 10, 104 +/- 47 and 194 +/- 82 microg cm(- 2), respectively (cf. non-quantifiable levels, 0. 1 and 1. 0 +/- 0. 7 microg cm(- 2) after ACV iontophoresis).

40|$|Introduction: The {{development}} of a reliable in vitro permeation system necessitates {{the use of a}} precise and accurate method of quantifying the amount of permeant partitioning from the membrane into the cell receptor phase. Aqueous donor and <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> fluids have been used in the majority of reported investigations, which makes quantitative permeant analysis relatively facile. Alternatively, radiolabelled diffusants have been used and flux rates monitored by scintillation counting, obviating the need for chromatographic separation of the receptor-phase components. However, this technique is not applicable when nonlabelled compounds or commercial dosage forms are to be evaluated by a cell system. Furthermore, several studies indicate that aqueous receptor phases may not present an optimal partitioning environment for certain lipophilic permeants (1 - 4), thereby impairing accurate flux monitoring due to limited diffusant solubility. Several attempts have therefore been made to improve the partitioning environment within these systems, by the addition of surfactants for example (4). A lipophilic receptor environment appears beneficial for corticosteroid partitioning, and thus, the use of isopropyl myristate has been investigated because of its bipolar properties that tend to mimic the biochemical composition of the skin (5, 6). Betamethasone 17 -valerate and its 21 -valerate degradation product are highly soluble in isopropyl myristate and this nonaqueous solvent will not augment C- 17 -to-C- 21 ester degradation reactions...|$|E
40|$|Rifampicin, {{a poorly}} soluble drug, has great {{importance}} in therapeutics {{as it is}} the main drug used to treat tuberculosis. The characterization of its permeability and the factors that influence it represent an important tool for predicting its bioavailability. Caco- 2 cell monolayers were used as models of the intestinal mucosa to assess the uptake and transport of rifampicin and the effects of various experimental conditions were investigated, in order to establish the influence of these variables on rifampicin permeability. Different pHs (5. 8, 6. 8 and 7. 4) in the apical medium, {{the presence or absence of}} mucin (3. 0 % w/v) in the donor site and the presence or absence of bovine serum albumin (4. 0 % v/v) in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> were the evaluated conditions. The quantification of rifampicin in the apical or basolateral chambers was performed by a validated HPLC-UV method. The change in the donor chamber pH showed that permeability values were greater at pH 6. 8, although this increase does not result in an alteration of the qualitative classification of rifampicin, which has high permeability. Mucin and bovine serum showed no effects on the permeability of rifampicin at the concentration tested. Overall, the current study suggests that pH, artificial mucin and bovine serum proteins have no influence on rifampicin permeability. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

40|$|Purpose: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the use of iontophoresis, soluble microneedles and their combination for the transdermal delivery of glycopyrrolate. Methods: In vitro permeation was tested using full thickness porcine ear skin mounted onto Franz diffusion cells. Iontophoresis (0. 5 mA/cm 2) was done for 4 h using Ag/AgCl electrodes. For microneedles, three line array (27 needles/line) of maltose microneedles were used to microporate the skin prior to mounting. Pore uniformity was determined by taking fluorescent images of distribution of calcein into pores and processing the images using an image analysis tool, which measured the fluorescent intensity in and around each pore to provide a pore permeability index (PPI). The donor chamber contained 500 µL of a 1 mg/mL solution of glycopyrrolate, and the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> contained 5 mL of 50 mM NaCl in deionized water. Samples were collected at predetermined time points over a period of 24 h and analyzed by HPLC. Skin irritation testing was performed with a 3 D cell culture kit of human skin. MTT assay determined cell viability; viability less than 50 % was considered irritant. Results: A control experiment which investigated passive permeation of glycopyrrolate delivered an average cumulative amount of 24. 92 ± 1. 77 µg/cm 2 at 24 h, while microneedle pretreatment increased permeability to 46. 54 ± 6. 9 µg/cm 2. Both iontophoresis (158. 53 ± 17. 50 µg/cm 2) and a combination of iontophoresis and microneedles (182. 43 ± 20. 06 µg/ cm 2) significantly increased delivery compared to passive and microneedles alone. Glycopyrrolate solution was found to be nonirritant with cell viability of 70. 4 % ± 5. 03 %. Conclusion: Iontophoresis and a combination of iontophoresis with microneedle pretreatment can be effectively used to enhance the transdermal delivery of glycopyrrolate.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether octenidine dihydrochloride or 2 -phenoxyethanol, the two main components of this disinfectant, permeate through animal skin in vitro. Therefore, permeation studies were conducted using Franz-type diffusion cells. 2 ml of the test compound were applied onto 1. 77 cm 2 split skin of cats, dogs, cows and horses. To simulate wounded skin, cattle skin was treated with adhesive tapes 100 times, as well. Up to an incubation time of 28 hours samples of the acceptor chamber were taken and were analysed by UV-HPLC. Using the method of the external standard, the apparent permeability coefficient, the flux J max, and the recovery were calculated. Furthermore, the residues of both components in the skin samples were determined after completion of the diffusion experiment. Results After 28 hours no octenidine dihydrochloride was found in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> of intact skin samples, while 2. 7 % of the topical applied octenidine dihydrochloride permeated through barrier disrupted cattle skin. 2 - phenoxyethanol permeated through all skin samples with the highest permeability in equine, followed by bovine, canine to feline skin. Furthermore, both components were found in the stratum corneum and the dermis of all split skin samples with different amounts in the examined species. Conclusion For 2 -phenoxyethanol the systemic impact of the high absorption rate and a potential toxicological risk have to be investigated in further studies. Due to its low absorption rates through the skin, octenidine dihydrochloride is suitable for superficial skin treatment in the examined species. </p...|$|E

Drug-in-adhesive patches containing 1. 35, 1. 03, 0. 68, and 0. 32 mg cm− 2 green tea extract were formulated and the dissolution of (−) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg), (−) -epigallocatechin (EGC) and (−) -epicatechin (EC) from these was determined. Transdermal delivery was determined across full thickness pig ear skin from saturated solutions of green tea extract in pH 5. 5 citrate–phosphate buffer, polyethylene glycol 400 and a 50 : 50 mixture of the citrate phosphate buffer and polyethylene glycol in addition to patches containing 1. 35 mg cm− 2 green tea extract. Dissolution experiments indicated first order release which was dose dependent in respect of the loading level, although the amounts permeated were not always proportional to the amounts in the formulation. The highest percentage permeation of EGCg was found to be from the patch formulation. EGCg, EGC and EC were all successfully delivered transdermally from saturated solutions and adhesive patches containing green tea extract in this study. There was some evidence for the dermal metabolism of EGCg, but after 24 h 0. 1 % permeated from the patches containing 1. 35 mg cm− 2 green tea extract. This was equivalent to the percentage absorbed after intragastric administration of green tea extract in rats. In addition, the concentration of EGCg in the Franz cell <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> after 24 h permeation from the 0. 9 cm diameter patch containing 1. 35 mg cm− 2 was within the range of Cmax plasma levels achieved after oral dosing of 2. 2 – 4. 2 g m− 2 green tea extract.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} {{investigation}} was to produce naproxen solid lipid nanoparticles (Nap-SLNs) by the ultrasonication method to improve its skin permeation and also to investigate the influence of Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) changes on nanoparticles properties. The properties of obtained SLNs loaded with naproxen were characterized by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). FT-IR was also used to investigate any interaction between naproxen and the excipients used {{at the molecular level}} during the preparation of the SLNs. The performance of the formulations was investigated in terms of skin permeation and also the retention of the drug by the skin. It was found that generally, with increasing the lipid concentration, the average particle size and polydispersity index (PDI) of SLNs increased from 94. 257 ± 4. 852 nm to 143. 90 ± 2. 685 nm and from 0. 293 ± 0. 037 to 0. 525 ± 0. 038 respectively. The results also showed that a reduction in the HLB resulted in an increase in the PDI, particle size, zeta potential and entrapment efficiency (EE %). DSC showed that the naproxen encapsulated in the SLNs was in its amorphous form. The peaks of prominent functional groups of naproxen were found in the FT-IR spectra of naproxen-SLN, which confirmed the entrapment of naproxen in the lipid matrix. FT-IR results also ruled out any chemical interaction between drug and the chemicals used in the preparation of SLNs. The amount of naproxen detected in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> at all the sampling times for the reference formulation (naproxen solution containing all surfactants at pH 7. 4) was higher than that of the Nap-SLN 8 formulation. Nap-SLN 8 showed an increase in the concentration of naproxen in the skin layer with less systemic absorption.

40|$|Mathematical drug release {{modelling}} of biodegradable polymeric {{systems by}} microencapsulation technology in textiles has not progressed much yet, {{because it is}} generally too complex. The release of a therapeutic agent from a formulation applied to the skin surface and its transport to the systemic circulation has a multistep process. The transdermal drug released is a feasible administration route for powerful, low-molecular weight therapeutic agents, which has to be accurate in their control of drug distribution. Moreover, many drugs are difficult to handle because they must be delivered slowly over a prolonged period to have a beneficial effect. In the present work, several examples of practical applications of mathematical models, developed through experimental drug release data, are given. For {{those involved in the}} design and development of biodegradable drug delivery systems, it will be useful to choose the generic mathematical model for several specific drug release problems. This transport model is based on the appropriate solution to Fick's second law of diffusion and can be used to explain drug release kinetics into this complex biological membrane (skin). Microspheres containing active principles were prepared using a solvent evaporation procedure with poly(vinyl alcohol) as surfactant in the external aqueous phase. Several biodegradable microspheres of biocompatible polymers, taken as delivery systems for active agent, have been studied. Polymers were PLGA (Poly(lactide-co-glycolide)) and PCL (poly(e-caprolactone)). The active compounds chosen were cosmetics and drugs, such as gallic acid, caffeine and ibuprofen. The microspheres obtained were characterized by the measure of encapsulation efficiency. The surface morphology and chemical structure of the micro particles were investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Nanosizer was used for particle size distribution. The application of the microspheres in the fabrics was carried out using Pad-Dry technique, since it is a simple and efficient technology and its working conditions are harmless to the system. The drug release system was analyzed, through samples of the treated fibre (cotton, polyamide, acrylic and polyester) in order to study the drug delivery behaviour in different media, deionized water and physiological saline (T= 37 ºC). The skin penetration profile by in vitro technique for different active principles was determined using pigskin. The release experiments are performed resorting to the Franz Diffusion cells apparatus (Lara-Spiral, Courtenon, France) consisting of two thermostatic chambers, the upper donor and the lower <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber,</b> divided by a skin biopsy. The main objective {{of this study is to}} create smart textiles which allow a controlled drug release for any active compound/substance. Such objective will allow the control of the textiles drug release in such a way that the active compound is released in the right quantity, at the right time and at the right place.

40|$|Catechins are a {{class of}} {{flavonoids}} present in high amounts in green tea. Catechins are of pharmaceutical interest as several in-vitro and animal {{studies have indicated that}} they possess beneficial therapeutic properties which include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, cardio-protective, neuro-protective and anti-cancer effects. Therefore, catechins are promising therapeutic agents for diseases and conditions such as hypertension, myocardial infarction, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. However, following consumption, catechins are poorly absorbed into the systemic circulation. Studies indicate that at most, 5 % of orally administered catechins are absorbed into the systemic circulation of rats. This poor oral absorption has been mainly attributed to their poor stability within the gastro-intestinal tract (GIT) and their poor permeability across the intestine. Nanoparticles (NPs), in particular those prepared from the biopolymers chitosan (CS) and alginate (Alg), have recently been used to enhance the oral absorption of compounds. The enhancement in oral absorption has been suggested to occur {{as a result of an}} enhancement in the stability of the compounds in the GIT and/or an enhancement in the permeability of the compound across the intestine by the NPs. Therefore, the hypothesis of this thesis was that NPs prepared from CS or Alg could enhance the oral absorption of catechins. To address this hypothesis, the aims were to: (i) encapsulate the catechin species (+) -catechin (CAT) and (-) -epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) in CS-tripolyphosphate (CS-TPP) and CS-Alg NPs; (ii) assess the impact of encapsulation on the stability of CAT and EGCG in simulated gastro-intestinal fluids; (iii) assess the impact of encapsulation on the absorption of CAT and EGCG across intestinal tissue in-vitro; and (iv) assess the impact of encapsulation on the systemic absorption of EGCG following oral administration to mice. CAT was encapsulated in CS-TPP and CS-Alg NPs with the particles exhibiting mean sizes of 163. 0 ± 2. 0 and 469. 2 ± 3. 1 nm (mean ± s. d., n = 3), respectively. EGCG was encapsulated in CS-TPP NPs and the particles exhibited a mean size of 165 ± 2. 0 nm (mean ± s. d., n = 3). Up to 5. 4 and 3. 7 µg of CAT and EGCG, respectively, were encapsulated per mg of the NPs. Encapsulation of the catechins in the NPs enhanced their stability. Encapsulation of CAT in CS-Alg NPs and CS-TPP NPs reduced its rate of degradation in simulated intestinal fluid pH 7. 4 by a factor of 1. 8 and 3. 0, respectively, while encapsulation of EGCG in CS-TPP NPs reduced its rate of degradation by a factor of 5. 5. Using excised mouse intestinal tissue (jejunum segment) mounted in Ussing chambers, it was observed that encapsulation significantly enhanced the absorption of EGCG. In the absence of encapsulation EGCG could not accumulate in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> beyond 1. 75 h, whereas in the presence of encapsulation, EGCG continued to accumulate in the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> beyond 1. 75 h, and at 3 h the cumulative amount of EGCG absorbed was 143. 8 ± 10. 8 ng/cm 2 (mean ± s. e. m., n = 3 - 4). However, the CS-TPP NPs could not significantly enhance the absorption of CAT (p > 0. 05). The cumulative amount of CAT absorbed at 4 h was 334. 0 ± 109. 9 and 477. 0 ± 165. 1 ng/cm 2 (mean ± s. e. m., n = 3 - 4), in the absence and presence of CS-TPP NP encapsulation, respectively. The mechanism by which absorption was enhanced was found to not be through an effect of the CS-TPP NPs on intestinal permeability (as shown by the transport of the marker compounds 14 C-mannitol and 3 H-propranolol) or an effect on intestinal efflux proteins (as shown by the transport of the P-glycoprotein substrate 3 H-digoxin) but was likely due to the enhanced stability of the EGCG following encapsulation. In the absence and presence of NP encapsulation 1. 3 ± 1. 7 and 56. 9 ± 3. 0 % (mean ± s. d., n = 3) of the initial EGCG concentration was present on the donor side of the tissue after 2 h. The enhanced EGCG concentrations following encapsulation were likely to have driven flux of EGCG across the intestine over the 3 h experimental period. In the case of CAT, 94. 9 ± 3. 8 and 99. 7 ± 0. 7 % (mean ± s. d., n = 3) of the initial CAT concentration was present in the donor chamber in the absence and presence of CS-TPP NP encapsulation, respectively. This small difference in CAT levels could explain the observation that the NPs could not significantly enhance the intestinal absorption of CAT. Following oral administration of EGCG to Swiss Outbred mice at a dose of 0. 76 mg/kg, the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) for non-metabolized and total EGCG was 114. 3 ± 4. 1 and 116. 4 ± 4. 1 nM. h (mean ± s. d., n = 3 - 5), respectively. However, following oral administration of EGCG encapsulated in the CS-TPP NPs, the AUC for non-metabolized and total EGCG was 166. 0 ± 12. 0 and 179. 3 ± 10. 8 nM. h (mean ± s. d., n = 3 - 5), respectively, indicating that encapsulation had enhanced the plasma exposure of EGCG by a factor of 1. 5. Measurement of the concentrations of EGCG in the GIT of the mice indicated that encapsulation had significantly enhanced (p ˂ 0. 05) the stability of EGCG in the stomach and jejunum of the mice. The enhanced stability resulted in an increase in the exposure of EGCG to the jejunum surface by a factor of 2. 3, and was likely to be responsible for the observed enhancement in the plasma exposure of EGCG. In conclusion, the results of this research indicate that encapsulation of EGCG in CS-TPP NPs enhances its oral absorption in mice, attributed to enhanced stability of the catechin in the GIT following encapsulation. Therefore, the results suggest that these NPs could also enhance the absorption of EGCG in humans, which may lead to the use of catechins as therapeutic agents for the above mentioned diseases and conditions...|$|E
40|$|Objective. In some countries, Atropine Sulphte (AS) is {{available}} as IM auto-injector for veterans {{as an antidote}} for OPs chemical attacks. We hypothesized that AS administered sublingually using rapidly disintegrating sublingual tablets (RDSTs) may have the potential as an alternative dosage form {{for the treatment of}} organophosphates toxicity. Our aim in this study was to evaluate, ex vivo, the permeation of AS using RDSTs formulation. Background. Organophosphates (OPs) are being used as pesticides and nerve agents. According to the American Association of Poison Control Center, OPs were responsible for ten thousand toxicity cases between 2011 and 2013 due to their use as pesticides in the United States. Also, OPs have been used against civilians several times as weapons of mass destruction, although prohibited by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. For the treatment of OPs toxicity, atropine sulfate (AS) 2 mg, as antidote, should be administered intramuscularly (IM) as soon as possible, alone or with other therapeutic agents. However, AS IM injections are not readily available for civilians in most OPs toxicity cases and require a health care professional for their administration. AS auto-injectors are only available for veterans 2 ̆ 7 use in some countries. These devices are expensive, bulky to carry, invasive, unavailable for civilians and veterans in many countries. Also, multiple devices are required for the administration of multiples doses of AS to treat OPs toxicity. We hypothesized that AS administered sublingually using rapidly disintegrating sublingual tablets (RDSTs) may have the potential as an alternative user-friendly dosage form for the treatment of organophosphates toxicity. Our aim in this study was to evaluate the feasibility of ex vivo permeation of AS using RDSTs formulation. Methods. Four batches of AS RDSTs, AS 2 mg RDSTs weighing 150 mg (B 1), and AS 2 mg, 4 mg, and 8 mg RDSTs weighing 50 mg each (B 2, B 3, and B 4, respectively), were manufactured by direct compression using a previously developed formulation. The ex vivo permeation of AS RDSTs was evaluated through excised porcine sublingual membrane using Franz cells (n= 4). Phosphate buffer, pH 6. 5, was used as a permeation medium. AS RDST was placed in the donor chamber that contained 2 mL of phosphate buffer. Aliquot samples, 200 μL, were withdrawn from the <b>receptor</b> <b>chamber</b> at several time-intervals. AS 2 mL solution, 1 mg/mL, was used as a reference (n= 4). Results. Mean ± SD AUC 0 - 90 AS permeation and influx (J) from B 4 (11037 ± 3661 μg/cm 2 /min, 3. 89 ± 1. 38 μg/cm 2 /min, respectively) were significantly higher (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) than B 3 (7753 ± 2002 μg/cm 2 /min, 1. 57 ± 0. 69 μg/cm 2 /min), B 2 (3650 ± 1499 μg/cm 2 /min, 1. 22 ± 0. 54 μg/cm 2 /min), B 1 (2895 ± 370 μg/cm 2 /min, 0. 953 ± 0. 36 μg/cm 2 /min), and the reference (2292 ± 648 μg/cm 2 /min, 0. 92 ± 0. 28 μg/cm 2 /min). Mean ± SD AUC 0 - 90 AS permeation and influx (J) from B 2 and B 1 was not significantly different (p 3 ̆e 0. 05) form the reference. Increasing AS dose in the RDSTs increased the cumulative AS permeated linearly, R 2 = 0. 999. Conclusion. The permeation of AS through the sublingual mucosa was feasible and increasing AS dose increased its permeation linearly. These novel RDSTs released AS and promoted its permeability similar to the reference solution. AS RDSTs may have the potential as an alternative non-invasive, user-friendly dosage form for the treatment of organophosphate toxicity. Dose-ranging animal studies are required to confirm these results and to determine the relative sublingual bioavailability of AS. Grants. SAC...|$|E
