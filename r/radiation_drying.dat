Temperature {{characteristics of the}} dried kelp were determined in terms of temperature distribution and surface-interior temperature variation. Rehydrated ratio, color, and texture before and after rehydration were measured to evaluate the quality of dried kelp products. Dielectric properties were also studied to observe the characteristics of rehydrated dried products. The {{results indicated that the}} total drying time required for IRD products was approximately 120 min, reduced by 56 % compared to AD (275 min). Infrared-dried products at 2. 4 μm wavelength and AD products were found to be more uniform from the thermal images and had higher rehydration ratios compared to others. IR- 2. 4 rehydrated products were the closest to blanched samples in hardness, springiness, cohesiveness, and chewiness.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{our study}} is to {{determine}} the drying curve and the change rate of drying by solar energy on two plant materials, olive pomace, and colocynth, depending on solar radiation. The dynamics of drying is monitored using an indirect solar dryer operating in forced convection, located at the UDES west of Algiers. We determine the influence of some parameters on the drying kinetics. We used two plant materials according to well-defined quantities which are characterized by different initial moisture content(Mafart P., 1991). In order to verify the reliabilityof the dryer to dry different products with different humidity, we studied the variation of the solar <b>radiation,</b> <b>drying</b> rate and variable ambient temperatures at the end of work we simulate using a software results in the change of obtaining plans designating the experimental curves obtained after the change of several parameters such as air temperature along the path in the dryer, as well as mass loss and speeds drying products subjected to drying...|$|E

The aim {{of the work is}} to describe temperatures and gas concentrations in the bed and to obtain data with high accuracy and with a resolution in space and time that is high enough to be useful for validation of mathematical models. To close mass balances of the main species, (C, H, O, N), O 2, CO, CO 2, N 2, H 2, H 2 O and hydrocarbons were measured, and samples of char and tar were analysed. For gas extraction an oil-cooled probe was used. The experimental rig was developed to achieve well-defined, one-dimensional, conditions. The measurements show the different episodes in the conversion front: initial heating by <b>radiation,</b> <b>drying,</b> release of volatiles, ignition and heat release, production of combustion products, depletion of oxygen followed by gasification reactions. During the stable devolatilisation phase a system of equations, based on concentrations measured by continuous gas analysis and mass balances, yields the content of tars, nitrogen and hydrogen (concentrations commonly not measured on-line) ...|$|E
40|$|Efficiency of a far-infrared {{radiation}} (FIR) dryer for drying of citrus by-products (CBPs) was evaluated through their antioxidant activities. The CBPs dried through FIR were enzymatically digested by six carbohydrases (AMG, Celluclast, Pectinase, Termamyl, Ultraflo and Viscozyme) to prepare digests {{for evaluation of}} the activities. The total polyphenolic and total flavonoid contents of the digests were determined by colorimetric assays. The AMG digest was selected for the further experiments. The antioxidant potential of the digests were evaluated by DPPH, superoxide, hydroxyl and alkyl radical scavenging activities, H 2 O 2 scavenging activity, metal chelating, lipid perox-idation inhibition and the reduction of DNA damage. The AMG digest from CBPs dried through FIR at 50 oC showed strong antioxidant activities in DPPH, superoxide, hydrogen peroxide, alkyl and metal chelating assays while all the digests showed strong lipid peroxidation activities. Further, enzymatic digests showed remarkable inhibitory activities against H 2 O 2 -induced DNA damage. Hence, the data obtained using different in vitro models clearly established the antioxidant potential of enzymatic digests from CBPs dried through FIR. Furthermore, {{they can be used}} as a source of natural antioxidants; hence, far-infrared <b>radiation</b> <b>drying</b> is a viable method for trans-forming wet CBPs into a dried form without destroying the bioactive components...|$|E

40|$|We {{present as}} areas of {{interest}} for multifield fracturing thermomechanical fracturing, fluid pressure induced isothermal and nonisothermal fracturing, fracturing due to <b>radiation,</b> <b>drying,</b> hydrogen embrittlement, and fractures induced by chemical effects. We discuss the most appropriate constitutive models for their simulation and choose the cohesive fracture model for quasi-brittle materials. Successively we show governing equations for a thermo-hydro-mechanical problem, which is representative for multifield problems. Possible extensions to more fields are addressed. Then methods for numerical modeling of multifield fracturing are presented and the most representative ones, i. e., interface and embedded discontinuity elements, X-FEM, thick level set and phase field models, and discrete crack approach with adaptive remeshing are discussed in some detail. After incorporating this last method in the governing equations, their numerical solution is shown together with the necessary adaptivity in time and space. This solution is validated. Successively applications to thermomechanical fracture; hydraulic fracturing {{in case of a}} pumped well and of 2 D and 3 D dams; fracturing of drying concrete and of a massive concrete beam and finally mechanical effects of chemical processes in concrete are shown. In the case of the pumped well with constant pumping rate, a comparison between an Extended Finite Element solution and that of the discrete crack approach with adaptive remeshing is made which allows for interesting considerations about the nature of hydraulic fracturing. The examples permit to conclude that with increasing complexity of the multifield problems that of the employed fracture models decreases, i. e., advanced fracture models have to date only been applied to problems with a limited number of fields, mainly displacement, thermal and/or pressure fields. There is hence plenty of room for improvement...|$|E

40|$|Humic {{substances}} (HSs) {{are products}} of biochemical transformations {{of plant and animal}} residues that make up a major fraction of the organic carbon of soil and aquatic systems in the environment. Because radioisotopes occur in the Earth’s crust and because the entire biosphere is continuously exposed to cosmic radiation, ionizing radiation continually interacts with HSs. This chronic irradiation could have a significant ecological impact. However, very few publications are available that address possible consequences of chronic exposure of HSs to ionizing radiation from terrestrial and cosmic sources. This study was conducted to investigate possible impacts of exposure of HSs to ionizing <b>radiation.</b> <b>Dried</b> humic acid (HA) or its associated aqueous solution (in 0. 1 M Na 2 CO 3) were exposed to absorbed γ-radiation in high doses of 1 – 90 kGy using a 60 Co source. Following the γ-ray exposures, a secondary, ultraweak radiation emanation with wavelengths in the spectral range λ = 340 – 650 nm was recorded as a long-lived chemiluminescence (CL) from the aqueous solutions; however, the CL was not observed after irradiating dry HA. Absorption spectra (for λ = 240 – 800 nm) of irradiated solutions indicated that polymeriza-tion/degradation processes were operating on the HA macromolecules. The effect of specific CL en-hancers (luminol and lucigenin) on the intensity and kinetics of the CL implicated the participation of reactive oxygen species and free radicals in the CL and polymerization/degradation processes.
