40|$|Purpose: {{this paper}} was to {{determine}} the impact of the wide-gap welding, with increased <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap, on structure and corrosion properties of the welded joints executed on duplex steel by one-side welding on ceramic backings. Design/methodology/approach: In the described work, experiments were conducted to welding tests for selected joints, visual examinations, non-destructive testing of welded joints, X-ray examinations, and metallographic testing of welded joints. Findings: As a result of the performed inspection, decreasing of the ferrite content with the increase of the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap (increase of welding heat input) was observed. The minimum measured ferrite content was not lower than 28 %, and the maximum value did not exceed 69 % (the permissible range being from 25 to 70 %). Research limitations/implications: Further studies on the impact of the wide-gap welding, with increased <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap, on structure and corrosion properties of the welded joints are required. Practical implications: The performed tests and examinations of welded joints with <b>root</b> <b>face</b> gap ranging from 6 to 10 mm were intended for extending the standard range from 2 to 6 mm.

Research supported by NSERCC, the University of Melbourne and the Australian Research Council y Research supported by the Australian Research Council 1 1 Introduction We consider planar maps in this paper.

A planar map is rooted if an edge is distinguished together with a vertex on the edge and a side of the <b>edge.</b> The <b>face</b> on the distinguished side is called the <b>root</b> <b>face.</b> For planar maps, by convention the <b>root</b> <b>face</b> must be the unbounded <b>face.</b> (Thus a <b>rooted</b> planar map is equivalent to a rooted map on the sphere with arbitrary <b>root</b> <b>face.)</b> Much {{work has been}} done on enumerating rooted planar ma [...] ...|$|R

Introduction A planar map C is a proper embedding of a connected graph on the sphere such that v(C) + f(C) e(C) = 2; (1) where v(C) (resp. f(C), e(C)) is the number of vertices (resp. <b>faces,</b> <b>edges)</b> of C.
