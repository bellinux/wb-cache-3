40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} and define on the basis of the literature the principal external and organizational factors and check to what extent they affect the efficiency of <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> as well as any resultant savings. The author proposes a conceptual model which correlates the results of <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> as well as savings with the main determinants identified on the basis of the literature. Then, in the operationalisation phase of the model, the dependent and independent variables were defined in the form of constructs. In accordance with the adopted model, individual constructs were measured based on standardised interviews. 	Materials and methods:  The results of <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> and any savings generated by this process are affected by certain determinants which are described in the literature. The adopted model included external factors, such as the cooperation of retailers with logistics operators and suppliers, the exchange of information in the supply chain, and organizational behaviour (experience of employees); as well as organizational factors related to the flow of information and IT systems. Due to financial and organisational restrictions, the originally planned representative sample of retail chains was limited to the regions of Wielkopolska and Lubuskie. In the end, 105 interviews were analysed. 	Results:  The results obtained in the research sample confirm assumptions about the possible potential savings that can be achieved as a result of appropriately conducted corporate policies in the area of reverse logistics. A correlation was also revealed between the experience and competencies of staff and the efficiency of <b>returns</b> <b>management.</b> 	Conclusions: Research into the factors affecting the efficiency of <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> and any savings resulting from <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> policies have not been conducted in Poland to date. The present study contributes to the growing trend of research into the logistics of product returns. It emphasises the role of cooperation in the supply chain, the experience and competencies of employees and the importance of computerization of the process as well as the impact of those factors on the efficiency of <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> and any potential savings.  ...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this doctoral thesis is {{to contribute to the}} fields of Finance and Information Management by focusing on an integrated risk and <b>return</b> <b>management</b> for investment projects in the Digital Economy. After introducing the transformation toward digitized value networks, an integrated risk and <b>return</b> <b>management</b> cycle that meets the requirements of value based management is presented, and challenges regarding its application in the valuation of investment projects are discussed. More precisely, these challenges concern specific aspects of identification, quantification, and reporting of risk and return, which are addressed in the research papers of this doctoral thesis. Regarding identification, the research papers analyze and classify the multitude of operational risks in digitized manufacturing. At this, the research papers conclude that the identification of threats, affected protection goals, and possible cascading effects in digitized value networks requires uniform understanding and comprehensive collaboration between companies and disciplines. Regarding quantification, the research papers focus on applying the principles of value-based management to investment projects in energy efficient IT in order to contribute to project planning and decision making. Both research papers disclose decision errors when disregarding the effects of fluctuating energy prices in the investment valuation. Regarding reporting, the research paper focuses on reporting standards for closed-ended alternative investment funds (closed-ended AIFs) that enable transparency and comparability for private investors. The advantages of the proposed valuation system are demonstrated by using a data sample of real closed-ended AIFs and by comparing the valuation system to the existing information provision.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} managerial and operational challenges associated with product <b>return</b> <b>management</b> and CLSC network design. The possibility of product return {{plays an important}} role in consumer 2 ̆ 7 s purchase decisions. It also motivates firms to extend their forward-only supply chain network structures to a Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) network and handle both forward and reverse flows of products. While the configuration of the CLSC network is a complex problem comprised of the determination of the optimal locations and capacities of factories, warehouses and collection centers, this problem becomes even more complex under the potential regulations on carbon emissions. This dissertation follows a three-paper format. With a focus on product <b>return</b> <b>management,</b> the first paper studies the roles that pricing and return policy play in the product exchange process for refurbished products. We first apply netnography to study consumer attitudes, general opinions and experiences concerning refurbished electronics purchases, and then propose an analytical model that considers customers 2 ̆ 7 purchasing and return behavior as a result of the firm 2 ̆ 7 s decisions regarding the pricing and return policy for refurbished products. The numerical results suggest that sellers should deliberately consider the market segmentation conditions, consumer valuation, and cost factors when choosing the appropriate price and return policy for refurbished products. The second and third paper focus on different aspects of CLSC network design. The second paper investigates a problem to design facility configurations that are robust to variations in possible carbon regulations and their cost and constraint implications. We establish a two-stage, multi-period stochastic programming model to include uncertain demand and return quantities and then extended it to incorporate the uncertainties in carbon regulation policy by the robust optimization method. We propose a hybrid model to account for either carbon tax or cap-and-trade regulatory policies and derive tractable robust counterparts under box and ellipsoidal uncertainty sets. Implications for network configuration, product allocation and transportation configuration are derived. We also present computational results that illustrate how the problem formulation under an ellipsoidal uncertainty set allows the decision maker to balance the trade-off between robustness and performance. The third paper formulates and solves an integrated model for product <b>return</b> <b>management</b> and CLSC network design considering uncertain carbon cost. We build a robust optimization model to address the carbon cost uncertainty, and develop a piecewise linear approximation for the nonlinear profit as a function of the refund. The results of the robust model are compared with those of deterministic models where no or only nominal carbon cost is considered. Extensive parametric analyses illustrate the impact of the cost, revenue and consumer profile parameters on the optimal refund, profit and network topology...|$|E

We find that this December spike cannot be fully explained by increase in the funds ’ risk exposures, or by higher factor risk premiums, or by funds ’ free-riding on end-of-year gaming by mutual funds. Our results suggest that this spike arises due to funds potentially managing their returns upwards in December. This spike seems to be achieved by (i) adding back in December the under-reported returns during earlier months of the year, and (ii) by borrowing from future returns.

40|$|One of {{the of the}} key {{barriers}} that hampers effective and efficient management of reverse flows detected within a number of empirical surveys and case studies focused on reverse logistics and/or <b>return</b> <b>management</b> is business (organisational) policy, specifically lack of policy, deficiency in existing policy or inferior policy. Despite this fact, there is a gap in literature which would show some evidence from practice that innovative reverse logistics policy both can pay off and is associated with certain aspects of reverse logistics management. Such proof can have several implications. It can support the call for better understanding and more research of the linkages of reverse logistics with other corporate functions, promote the acceptation of strategic character of reverse logistics and stress the role of RL policy within the rest of overall corporate management. The aim {{of this paper is}} to contribute and to enrich the existing body of knowledge concerning the above-mentioned gap through presentation of survey results that was realized in 2012 among managers of 244 Czech firms.

40|$|Background Omni-channel {{retailing}} {{has developed}} {{as an extension}} of multi-channel retailing. The difference between the concepts is the level of integration, where an omni-channel requires seamless and complete channel integration compared to a multi-channel where the level of integration varies from non-existing to high. Today’s customers expect an integrated shopping experience where they can combine the different channels according to their preferences and omni-channel is a way for retailers to meet this need. Purpose The purpose of this thesis is to explore the concept of omni-channel retailing and its implementation in retail firms operating in the Swedish market. Method This study is based on an interpretive approach and takes the form of an exploratory multiple case study through the investigation of four retailers. Qualitative data was collected through semi-structured interviews and the findings were analyzed abductively. Conclusion The conclusion of this thesis is that the investigated retailers still have, more or less, {{a long way to go}} in their integrative efforts. The retailer that has come the furthest in their effort has only implemented nine out of fifteen omni-channel criteria. Three main incentives for implementing an omni-channel strategy were identified. These are to respond to customer demands, to optimize the individual sales channels and to gain a competitive advantage. Additionally, several challenges arise as the retailer moves towards an omni-channel. These include technological investments, change management, channel conflict, <b>return</b> <b>management</b> and consistency. Furthermore, five potential sources of these challenges were identified as technological requirements, organizational changes, sales accreditation policies, in-store returns and finally the franchise business model...|$|E

Where in the past these were disposed of via (public) waste management systems or sold in cascade markets, now <b>returns</b> <b>management</b> becomes key to focal companies. Moreover, recent literature emphasizes that returns can be a value creator rather than a cost of business as it can save the environment, provide critical resources and customer value.
