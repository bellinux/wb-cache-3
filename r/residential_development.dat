5|$|<b>Residential</b> <b>development</b> {{had been}} {{gradually}} spreading westward from Belgravia since the 1840s, but {{the area around}} the station site was mainly in horticultural use as market gardens when the new line was constructed. The planning of the line encouraged the local land owners, including Lord Kensington, to extend Cromwell Road westwards and the opening of Gloucester Road station, stimulated rapid <b>residential</b> <b>development</b> in the surrounding area.|$|E

5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated the construction of new areas of private and public <b>residential</b> <b>development</b> throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|At State Street, NY38 leaves US20 and NY5 {{and heads}} north through the city's north side, {{crossing}} the Owasco Outlet and serving the Auburn Correctional Facility.

5|$|<b>Residential</b> <b>development</b> of the mountain's {{southern}} foothills {{has been}} on the rise for several years, primarily in the form of single-family residences. Construction costs have continued to rise as well, in part because of a bill passed in 2003. Oregon House Bill 3375 required that new construction on slopes of 20 percent or greater with unstable soil undergo increased regulation and an extended approval process. The bill doubled the cost of new foundations to around $20,000 to $30,000, and the cost of retrofitting an existing structure approached $100,000.|$|E
5|$|Several inner-city neighborhoods {{have begun}} to gentrify in recent years. Areas on both the west side (Ohio City, Tremont, Detroit-Shoreway, and Edgewater) and the east side (Collinwood, Hough, Fairfax, and Little Italy) have been {{successful}} in attracting increasing numbers of creative class members, which in turn is spurring new <b>residential</b> <b>development.</b> Furthermore, a live-work zoning overlay for the city's near east side has facilitated the transformation of old industrial buildings into loft spaces for artists.|$|E
