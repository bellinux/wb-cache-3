5|$|According to Jain texts, Mahavira's nirvana (death) {{occurred}} {{in the town of}} Pawapuri (Bihar). His life as a spiritual light and the night of his nirvana is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> Jains as Diwali on the same night that Hindus celebrate their festival of lights. On the night that Mahavira died, his chief disciple Gautama is said to have attained omniscience.|$|E
5|$|Skarga is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> Poles as a {{vigorous}} early advocate of reforms to the Polish-Lithuanian polity, {{and as a}} critic of the Commonwealth's governing classes, as well as of its religious tolerance policies.

5|$|In 1937, Garran {{was made}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG), the third time he had been knighted. Shortly after the {{establishment}} of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran's influence on Canberra is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> the naming of the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, and his link with ANU is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> the naming of a chair in the university's School of Law, by the naming of the hall of residence Burton & Garran Hall and by the naming of Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with that school.|$|E
5|$|Johnston's {{connections}} with the University of Washington (where he had carried out his masters and doctoral research) are <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> a memorial fund that established an endowed graduate-level fellowship within {{what is now the}} department of Earth and Space Sciences.

Johnston Memorial Fellowship for Research Excellence', a number of awards of this fellowship have been made over the years since it was launched.|$|E

5|$|Mercer {{remains the}} most senior Canadian officer ever to die in combat and was unfortunate to be killed at the opening {{engagement}} of the largest battle of his career, when he was trapped by shellfire during a front line reconnaissance and overrun during the subsequent German attack. The division Mercer created and trained remained {{one of the best}} units of the Canadian army under his successor Louis Lipsett and Mercer was <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> the men under his command, many of whom attended his funeral {{in the aftermath of the}} Battle of Mount Sorrel.|$|E
5|$|Micheline Connery, Sean's wife, had met up-and-coming actress Kim Basinger at a {{hotel in}} London and {{suggested}} her to Connery, which he agreed upon. For the role of Felix Leiter, Connery spoke with Bernie Casey, saying that as the Leiter role was never <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> audiences, using a black Leiter might make him more memorable. Others cast included comedian Rowan Atkinson, who would later parody Bond in his role of Johnny English.|$|E
5|$|Staszic was <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> {{his contemporaries}} as a loner {{and not a}} person who was quick to make friends. He has been {{described}} as somewhat miserly; despite acquiring significant wealth, he was said to wear old clothes and use an old carriage. He was nonetheless widely respected by his contemporaries. He was seen as stern but honest, and had a tendency to speak in a fashion that some found amusing.|$|E

5|$|Stearn {{received}} many honours for his work, {{at home and}} abroad, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1957. Considered {{one of the most}} eminent British botanists of his time, he is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> an essay prize in his name from the Society for the History of Natural History, and a named cultivar of Epimedium, one of many genera he produced monographs on. He is the botanical authority for over 400 plants that he named and described.|$|E
5|$|As a scientist, Oppenheimer is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> his {{students}} and colleagues {{as being a}} brilliant researcher and engaging teacher who was the founder of modern theoretical physics in the United States. Because his scientific attentions often changed rapidly, he never worked long enough on any one topic and carried it to fruition to merit the Nobel Prize, although his investigations contributing {{to the theory of}} black holes may have warranted the prize had he lived long enough to see them brought into fruition by later astrophysicists. An asteroid, 67085 Oppenheimer, was named in his honor, as was the lunar crater Oppenheimer.|$|E
5|$|But {{above all}} Mario Vargas Llosa uses the fictional Urania to {{facilitate}} the novel's attempt at remembering the regime. The novel opens and closes with Urania's story, effectively framing the narrative {{in the terms of}} remembering the past and understanding its legacy in the present. In addition, because of her academic study {{of the history of the}} Trujillo regime, Urania is also confronting the memory of the regime for the country as a whole. This is in keeping with one purpose of the book, which is to ensure that the atrocities of the dictatorship and the dangers of absolute power will be <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> a new generation.|$|E

5|$|Conn Smythe {{was born}} on February 1, 1895, in Toronto to Albert Smythe, an Irish Protestant from County Antrim who immigrated to Canada in 1889, and Mary Adelaide Constantine, an English woman. Mary and Albert were married in the 1880s while immigrating to Canada. Albert and Mary had a rocky {{marriage}} and did not live together {{for more than a}} few months at a time. Mary, who was known as Polly, was <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> Conn as pretty, a drinker and troublemaker, while Albert was quiet, a vegetarian and a devoted member of Madame Blavatsky's Theosophical movement. Albert Smythe was a charter member of the Theosophical Society of Canada in 1891, and edited its newsletter until the final years of his life.|$|E
5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in his fifties. Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at least {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|Faulks {{developed}} the novel {{to bring more}} public awareness {{to the experience of}} war <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> WWI veterans. Most critics found this effort successful, commenting on how the novel, like many other WWI novels, thematically focuses on {{the way in which the}} experience of trauma shapes individual psyches. Similarly, because of the parallel narratives WWI and 1970s Britain, the novel explores metahistorical questions about how to document and recover narratives about the past. Because of its genre, themes and writing style, the novel has been favourably compared to a number of other war novels, like Ian McEwan's Atonement and those in Pat Barker's Regeneration Trilogy.|$|E

5|$|Following the incident, the {{government}} offered dialogue which the opposition {{said they will}} only take part in after {{the withdrawal of the}} army. The general labor union called for a general strike. Internationally, the attack on protesters was condemned by Barack Obama and Human Rights Watch. High Representative of European Union expressed her deep concerns and called for restrain and immediate dialogue. Britain revoked over forty arms licenses to Bahrain after an earlier announcement that it would review them and German president canceled a planned visit to the country. Buhmaid is <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> the opposition as a martyr, leader and symbol of peacefulness.|$|E
5|$|His {{abilities}} seemingly in decline, Johnson {{was traded}} to Pittsburgh in 1960, where he had the most productive years of his career, recording two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He remains the oldest player to record a 1,000-yard rushing season {{as well as the}} oldest to rush for 200 or more yards in a game. A four-time Pro Bowl selection, Johnson ranked third on the NFL's all-time rushing yards list when he retired, but was best <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> his peers for the mark he left with his blocking. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987.|$|E
5|$|On 14 April 1999, the Pakistan Post, {{as part of}} its 'Scientists of Pakistan' series, {{issued a}} {{commemorative}} stamp to honour the contributions and services of Siddiqui.

Siddiqui was also <b>remembered</b> <b>by</b> his students and colleagues, many of whom continued to dedicate their international research and publications to his memory. In 2002, a research article was published in the journal Tetrahedron in which, authors Faizi and Naz dedicated their break-through research to the memory of Siddiqui, their mentor.|$|E
